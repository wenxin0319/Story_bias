ProtagonistA was a very strict man 
 ProtagonistA always told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB had to obey ProtagonistA and never disobey ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistB came home , ProtagonistA was very angry with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB was never to disobey ProtagonistA again 
 ProtagonistA never knew ProtagonistA's mother , and ProtagonistA's father died when ProtagonistA was just a boy 
 ProtagonistA always dreamed of finding ProtagonistA's mother , but ProtagonistA never did 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was out walking along the river , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB only smiled and walked away 
 ProtagonistA never saw ProtagonistB again , but ProtagonistA always remembered ProtagonistB's smile 
It was one warm day in March , in a city so full of life that the air was full of everything that the wind might blow in , that ProtagonistA was driving along the street when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was a kind - hearted man , and ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was in need of help 
 ProtagonistA offered to take ProtagonistB in for the night , and ProtagonistB was grateful 
 ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB a place to stay and helped ProtagonistB find a job 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider 
 ProtagonistA was never quite sure why , but ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA did n't quite fit in with the other kids at school 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit shy when it came to girls , but ProtagonistA was determined to lose ProtagonistA's virginity before ProtagonistA started college 
 ProtagonistA had heard all the stories about how college was a time to let loose and experiment , and ProtagonistA did n't want to be the odd one out 
 So , when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB at a party who was willing to sleep with ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA did n't hesitate 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB back to ProtagonistA's room and they had sex 
 ProtagonistA felt a sense of relief that ProtagonistA had finally lost ProtagonistA's virginity 
 Now ProtagonistA could focus on enjoying the rest of ProtagonistA's college experience 
 ProtagonistA had been spending as much time as possible with ProtagonistB , and today they were sitting in the little room in the King 's house within the great garden 
 ProtagonistA sat there for a long time , holding ProtagonistB's hand and looking out at the garden 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was in a better place now , but ProtagonistA would miss ProtagonistB dearly 
 ProtagonistA had killed ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistC's body was never found 
 ProtagonistA always suspected that ProtagonistB was still alive and out there somewhere 
 ProtagonistA was always looking over ProtagonistA's shoulder , never knowing when or where ProtagonistB would strike 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking alone when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA froze in fear , not knowing what to do 
  ProtagonistA ran away as fast as ProtagonistA could , but ProtagonistB was right behind ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA lay dying , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was finally going to get ProtagonistB's justice 
ProtagonistA was an old woman with a heart of stone 
 ProtagonistA never showed any emotion , not even when ProtagonistA's husband died 
 As they all sipped on their cups of coffee , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a bit out of place 
 But as the conversation went on , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA warming up to the topic and even managed to contribute a few witty comments 
 By the end of the evening , ProtagonistA was feeling quite pleased with ProtagonistA for managing to hold ProtagonistA's own in such company 
ProtagonistA had been walking ProtagonistB for what felt like forever , but ProtagonistA had nothing to lose 
 ProtagonistA had been walking the same route , day in and day out , for years 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA could n't just leave ProtagonistB there 
 ProtagonistA sat down and waited , hoping ProtagonistB would start moving again 
 But after a while , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to keep going without ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had always been interested in art , so when ProtagonistA saw the Gallery of the Imperial Palace , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to go in 
 ProtagonistA was not disappointed 
 ProtagonistA was so impressed that ProtagonistA decided ProtagonistA wanted to make a work out of ProtagonistA's own life 
 ProtagonistA took up residence in a double - room with a balcony , and ProtagonistC took ProtagonistA in hand 
 ProtagonistA began to learn about the different techniques used by ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA soon developed ProtagonistA's own style 
 ProtagonistA started to create paintings and sculptures that reflected ProtagonistA's own life and experiences 
 ProtagonistA's work became very popular , and ProtagonistA became one of the most famous artists in the world 
The sun rose slowly over the city , but in the midst of all the misery of the war - torn city , ProtagonistA rose up 
 ProtagonistA seemed to have been driven into a very inconvenient position during the war , and for the most part it was the fault of ProtagonistB's parents , who were not at all happy , poor , or otherwise about ProtagonistB in the least 
 So ProtagonistA was all alone in the city with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had to find food and shelter for ProtagonistB , and protect ProtagonistB from the dangers of the city 
 But ProtagonistA did , and ProtagonistA did it all with love 
ProtagonistA had been drinking with ProtagonistA's husband and ProtagonistB at a little inn in a certain town in the United States at the time when the great tempo of American industry was at an end 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had to stay and face the mob 
 ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA ran away , the mob would only chase after ProtagonistA and hurt ProtagonistA's sister and husband in the process 
 So ProtagonistA stood ProtagonistA's ground as the mob approached the inn 
 ProtagonistA could hear them shouting and cursing at ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't flinch 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to act fast 
 ProtagonistA ran into the burning building and started looking for people to rescue 
 ProtagonistA managed to get a few people out , but the smoke and flames were too much for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA collapsed just as the roof of the inn came crashing down 
ProtagonistA was sitting at ProtagonistA's dining - room table in the picture - room , watching with some interest as the door of ProtagonistA's second - class compartment was pushed open 
 ProtagonistA had been expecting someone to come in , but ProtagonistA was not sure who it would be 
 As the door opened , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA leaned back in ProtagonistA's chair and crossed ProtagonistA's arms 
  ProtagonistA 'm listening ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA considered the offer for a moment 
 But ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA was ready to sell ProtagonistA's land and move away from the only home ProtagonistA had ever known 
 ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB walked out of the room and closed the door behind ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what ProtagonistA was going to do with the rest of ProtagonistA's life , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA did n't want to sell ProtagonistA's land 
ProtagonistA had always been close with ProtagonistB 
 So when ProtagonistB passed away three years ago , ProtagonistA made the decision to move in with ProtagonistB's family and help take care of them 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistC loved fishing , so ProtagonistA took ProtagonistC out on the boat and they spent the day fishing together 
ProtagonistA was walking to the door of ProtagonistB's cabin when ProtagonistA heard the birds chirping 
 ProtagonistA smiled and waved to them as ProtagonistA walked by 
 ProtagonistA had always loved spending time at ProtagonistB's cabin in the woods 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and walked in 
  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA 'm here !  ProtagonistA called out 
 ProtagonistA said goodnight to ProtagonistB and went to ProtagonistA's room 
 ProtagonistA lay in bed for a while , listening to the birds outside , before ProtagonistA fell asleep 
ProtagonistA went to bed in the morning , early , thinking of the presents ProtagonistA would be leaving ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had gotten ProtagonistB a watch , a new pair of shoes , and a tie 
 ProtagonistA wrapped them all up in tissue paper and placed them under the tree 
 ProtagonistA could n't wait to see the look on ProtagonistB's face when ProtagonistB opened them 
 ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistB would be surprised and delighted 
ProtagonistA was lying on the floor on ProtagonistA's back , rocking back and forth , stretching out ProtagonistA's heels in the air 
 ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's usual spot , in the middle of the living room , where ProtagonistA had been lying for the past hour 
 ProtagonistA was wearing ProtagonistA's usual clothes , a pair of faded jeans and a white t - shirt 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner , never really fitting in anywhere 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a dreamer , always chasing after something that was just out of reach 
 ProtagonistA was thirty - five years old and ProtagonistA had nothing to show for it 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a writer , but ProtagonistA had never been able to get anything published 
 ProtagonistA had written novel after novel , but they had all been rejected 
 ProtagonistA had even tried writing non - fiction , but that had been a bust as well 
 ProtagonistA had thought about giving up writing altogether , but ProtagonistA just could n't do it 
 It was the one thing in ProtagonistA's life that ProtagonistA was passionate about 
 ProtagonistA loved the act of creating something out of nothing 
 ProtagonistA reached over and grabbed it , not even bothering to look at the caller ID
Hello ?  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's voice sounding tired even to ProtagonistA's own ears 
  What are ProtagonistA up to?Nothing much ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'm just feeling a bit down about ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA guess 
  ProtagonistA 're a great writer 
 Thanks , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA appreciate the vote of confidence 
 ProtagonistA want to join me?Sure ,  ProtagonistA said , getting up off the floor 
  ProtagonistA could use a drink 
ProtagonistA was a middle - aged man who was pretty good looking , although ProtagonistA looked as if ProtagonistA had been out in the sun too much 
 ProtagonistA worked as a gardener and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's job 
 ProtagonistA was always out in the sun , working hard and making things look beautiful 
 One day , ProtagonistA was working in ProtagonistA's garden when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking by 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but stare at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had never seen someone so beautiful in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA even named ProtagonistB  Bob  after ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so fascinated by ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA even started to imitate ProtagonistB's movements 
 ProtagonistA would climb up and down the furniture in the room , always keeping an eye on ProtagonistB 
 It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was so excited to see ProtagonistB in ProtagonistB's natural habitat 
 ProtagonistA was so thrilled that ProtagonistA had been able to see ProtagonistB up close and in person 
 It was an experience ProtagonistA would never forget 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner 
 ProtagonistA never really had any close friends , but ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was struggling to keep up the facade of being a straight man 
 The night of ProtagonistA's murder , ProtagonistA had finally decided that ProtagonistA could n't take it anymore 
 ProtagonistA was going to come out to ProtagonistA's family and tell them the truth 
 What 's wrong ? ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head , still trying to escape the vault 
 ProtagonistA do n't know , ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA do n't know 
 ProtagonistA was always one of the nicest people ProtagonistB knew , always willing to help others 
 When ProtagonistB was struggling in school , ProtagonistA was the one who tutored ProtagonistB and helped ProtagonistB get back on track 
 When ProtagonistB was going through a tough time in ProtagonistB's life , ProtagonistA was the one who was there for ProtagonistB , supporting ProtagonistB and helping ProtagonistB get through it 
 ProtagonistA was truly one of the greatest people ProtagonistB had ever known 
 ProtagonistA had passed away suddenly , and it hit ProtagonistB like a ton of bricks 
 ProtagonistA would want ProtagonistB to live ProtagonistB's life to the fullest and to help others , just like ProtagonistA always did 
One day , when ProtagonistA was about twelve years old , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were riding in the back of a coach through the suburbs of New York 
 ProtagonistA was very interested in everything ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA looked at the house and thought it looked very nice 
 ProtagonistA could imagine ProtagonistA living there one day 
The last time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a man 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a happy man who was content with ProtagonistB's life 
 When it finally happened , ProtagonistA was at work 
 ProtagonistA got a call from ProtagonistA's father , who was sobbing uncontrollably 
 ProtagonistA could barely understand what ProtagonistA's father was saying , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to go home 
 When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB's body lying in ProtagonistB's bed 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's life would never be the same without ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the corner of the sofa , with ProtagonistA's head resting on the edge of the sofa , when ProtagonistA heard the front door open 
 ProtagonistA knew it was ProtagonistB , coming home from work 
 ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB put ProtagonistB's keys down on the table and hang up ProtagonistB's coat 
 Then , ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB's footsteps coming towards the living room 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was just tired and needed a nap 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA was comfortable where ProtagonistA was and that ProtagonistA would just stay on the sofa 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking hand in hand with a dead man 
 ProtagonistA felt a strong urge to help , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if it was any of ProtagonistA's business 
 ProtagonistA could have easily gone either way , but ProtagonistA decided to help 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and asked if ProtagonistB needed any help 
 ProtagonistA was only three , and ProtagonistA did n't really understand what was happening 
One day in August , a winter in the West , ProtagonistA came to a village to pick up ProtagonistC 
 When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA found that the village was in the middle of a snowstorm 
 ProtagonistA went to the nearest house and knocked on the door 
 ProtagonistA asked if ProtagonistA could come in and warm up 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA was looking for ProtagonistC as well 
 In the morning , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC left for home 
 ProtagonistA was very grateful to ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's family for their help 
ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistB's head , and down at ProtagonistB's feet , and said ,  ProtagonistB 'll be ProtagonistB's companion 
  Then ProtagonistA went on ProtagonistA's way 
The night ProtagonistA rose from ProtagonistA's deepest sleep ProtagonistA was found by ProtagonistB in the midst of the crowd of people who were gathered below the palace 
 ProtagonistA had been asleep for years , ever since ProtagonistA was a child 
ProtagonistA had been on the ship for weeks , and was excited to finally be reaching their destination 
 However , shortly before they arrived , ProtagonistA became ill with cholera 
 ProtagonistA quickly succumbed to the disease and died , never reaching ProtagonistA's destination 
 ProtagonistA had been the only child of ProtagonistA's parents , who were honest and hard - working people , and ProtagonistA had always been a good and obedient son 
 ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to help ProtagonistB , but it was hard for a boy of ProtagonistA's age to earn enough to keep them both 
ProtagonistA had been drinking with ProtagonistB all evening , and ProtagonistA had been told to go to bed early , for ProtagonistA was going to spend all night with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was excited to spend the night with ProtagonistB , as ProtagonistA had not seen ProtagonistB in many years 
 ProtagonistA tried to stay awake , but ProtagonistA eventually fell asleep 
ProtagonistA was a blonde girl with long black hair , and while ProtagonistA knew it was only a possibility that ProtagonistA would one day be all of thirty - two , it did n't matter 
 The life ProtagonistA had now was perfect , and ProtagonistA was content to live it out as best ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA had a great job , a loving family , and ProtagonistB 
 What more could ProtagonistA ask for?As ProtagonistA's birthday approached , ProtagonistA began to feel a sense of dread 
 ProtagonistA knew that once ProtagonistA turned thirty - two , ProtagonistA's life would change 
 ProtagonistA would have to take on more responsibility , and ProtagonistA would have to start thinking about the future 
 It was a lot to take in , and ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA was ready for it 
 On the day of ProtagonistA's birthday , ProtagonistA woke up feeling nervous 
 ProtagonistA had a feeling that something was going to happen , but ProtagonistA did n't know what 
 ProtagonistA went about ProtagonistA's day as usual , trying to push the feeling out of ProtagonistA's mind 
 ProtagonistA knew what was coming 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA was happy , but ProtagonistA was also scared 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's life was about to change forever 
 ProtagonistA knew that this was the only way to save ProtagonistA's kingdom from the invading army , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like ProtagonistA was signing ProtagonistA's own death warrant 
 With a heavy heart , ProtagonistA agreed to the marriage and the two were we d 
 As they walked down the aisle , ProtagonistA could n't help but think of the life ProtagonistA could have had with someone else 
 But ProtagonistA knew that this was ProtagonistA's duty and ProtagonistA had to see it through 
ProtagonistA was not having a good day 
 First , ProtagonistA got into a fight with ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was so embarrassed and angry that ProtagonistA wanted to just crawl under a rock and die 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was only trying to help , but ProtagonistB's words just made ProtagonistA feel worse 
 Later that night , ProtagonistA talked to ProtagonistC and made up with ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA also apologized to ProtagonistA's teacher 
 As for ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA decided to just ignore ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt a sudden urge to confess all of ProtagonistA's secrets to ProtagonistB 
 Instead , ProtagonistA cleared ProtagonistA's throat and began ProtagonistA's speech 
ProtagonistA had been walking the streets for days , ever since ProtagonistA ran away from home 
 ProtagonistA was 15 now , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could take on the world 
 ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was going or what ProtagonistA was going to do , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get away from ProtagonistA's abusive father 
 ProtagonistA had nowhere to go and no one to turn to 
 One day , as ProtagonistA was walking around aimlessly , ProtagonistA came across a strange looking building 
 ProtagonistA walked up to the door and peered inside 
 ProtagonistA walked towards the light , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized it was coming from a window 
 ProtagonistA climbed up to the window and looked inside 
 ProtagonistA climbed through the window and into the room , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had been transported to another world 
 But in the corner of the room , ProtagonistA saw a small bed 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to wake the child , but ProtagonistA did n't want to leave them alone in this strange place 
 ProtagonistA stood there for a moment , unsure of what to do 
 But then ProtagonistA heard a noise from outside the room 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to be caught , so ProtagonistA quickly hid under the bed 
 ProtagonistA heard the door to the room open , and then ProtagonistA heard footsteps 
 ProtagonistA held ProtagonistA's breath , hoping they would n't find ProtagonistA 
 But then ProtagonistA heard a voice 
  ProtagonistA can come out 
 ProtagonistA slowly crawled out from under the bed and looked at ProtagonistB 
  Who are ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA had never met a witch before 
  What are ProtagonistB doing here ?  ProtagonistA asked 
  ProtagonistA 're in a lot of trouble , and ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB's help 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA could trust ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did n't have anywhere else to turn 
  Okay ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'll do whatever ProtagonistB say 
On that snowy morning in March , ProtagonistA was walking through the great halls of the castle at the summit of a vast and summaing mount , when ProtagonistA came face to face with ProtagonistB 
 I - I'm Bob , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA replied , bowing low 
 ProtagonistA was out walking in the forest and ProtagonistA got turned around 
 ProtagonistA did n't mean to trespass , ProtagonistA swear 
 ProtagonistA must be cold after ProtagonistA's journey 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA walked forward and seated ProtagonistA in a chair by the fire 
 ProtagonistA nodded , and ProtagonistA felt a warmth spreading through ProtagonistA , not just from the fire but from ProtagonistB's words 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB's advice , and ProtagonistA would always be grateful for ProtagonistB's kindness 
On the night of the triumph of God , when the clouds of the tempest were in their most profuse motion , ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's womb , and bearing a son , whose name was John , uttered a pious prayer to St
  It 's a beautiful day , is n't it?Yes , it is ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA sat down on the bench next to ProtagonistB 
 I can see that ,  ProtagonistA said , chuckling 
 ProtagonistA leaned back and enjoyed the good weather and the company of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was a young man of twenty , with ProtagonistB and two small children 
 ProtagonistA worked in a factory in Manchester , and ProtagonistB worked as a maid in a large house in London 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking home from work , when ProtagonistA saw a group of men standing on the corner , talking and laughing 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that they were talking about a new war that was starting in Europe 
 ProtagonistA had never thought about war before , and ProtagonistA could n't imagine why anyone would want to fight 
 The next day , ProtagonistA went to work as usual , but ProtagonistA could n't concentrate 
 All ProtagonistA could think about was the war 
 ProtagonistA wondered what it would be like , and if ProtagonistA would ever see ProtagonistA's family again 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA had no money , and no way to support ProtagonistA's family 
 Then , one day , ProtagonistA saw a poster advertising for soldiers to fight in the war 
 ProtagonistA knew that it was ProtagonistA's duty to fight for ProtagonistA's country , and ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA could make some money to support ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA was also excited 
 ProtagonistA was going to be a hero 
 ProtagonistA fought in many battles , and ProtagonistA was wounded several times 
 But ProtagonistA never gave up , and ProtagonistA never stopped fighting 
 ProtagonistA was a different man now 
 ProtagonistA had seen things that ProtagonistA could never have imagined , and ProtagonistA had done things that ProtagonistA never thought ProtagonistA would do 
 But ProtagonistA was also a hero , and ProtagonistA was proud of what ProtagonistA had done 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB lived happily ever after , and they never forgot the war 
ProtagonistA was walking home from work when ProtagonistA noticed a strange light in the sky 
 ProtagonistA could see a figure inside the light , and it was speaking to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what to believe , but ProtagonistA knew that this was something ProtagonistA had to do 
 There ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was to defeat ProtagonistB and free the city 
 ProtagonistA took the sword and set off on ProtagonistA's journey 
 ProtagonistA had never felt so alive before 
 With every step ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's power growing 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could do anything 
 When ProtagonistA arrived in the city , ProtagonistA could see the fear in the people 's eyes 
 But ProtagonistA was different 
 ProtagonistA had the power to defeat ProtagonistB 
 And ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's purpose in life 
 ProtagonistA was the chosen one , and ProtagonistA would never give up 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the veranda of the front door with ProtagonistA's hands on the knob 
 ProtagonistA was about to go inside when ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA got up and looked around 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on the ground with ProtagonistB's head in ProtagonistB's hands 
 ProtagonistA went over to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB a glass of water and a seat on the couch 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistB was welcome to stay with ProtagonistA as long as ProtagonistB needed 
 ProtagonistA was awaiting the publication of ProtagonistA's work , which was entitled A History of the World 
 ProtagonistA determined to devote to the study of it all that was worthy of ProtagonistA's mind and to the satisfaction of the human race 
 ProtagonistA reassured ProtagonistB that the world would go on long after they were gone 
 ProtagonistA promised to write a history of it so that ProtagonistB could understand it 
ProtagonistA sits cross - legged on the floor of the dark alcove , ProtagonistA's fingers tracing the lines of a small painting 
 ProtagonistA feels a sense of peace and calm whenever ProtagonistA looks at the painting , and ProtagonistA 's been coming to this alcove to look at it every day for the past week 
 today , as ProtagonistA looks at the painting , ProtagonistA notices something new 
 It 's a child , ProtagonistA realizes , and they 're reaching out to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA ca n't help but smile at the image , and ProtagonistA feels ProtagonistA's heart fill with warmth 
ProtagonistA had been looking forward to this day for months 
 ProtagonistA spent the morning getting dressed and making sure everything was perfect 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to make any mistakes 
 When it was finally time to leave , ProtagonistA took a deep breath and walked out the door 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to be there that ProtagonistA did n't even notice the time passing 
 ProtagonistA was absolutely thrilled 
ProtagonistA was always a bit of an oddball 
 Even though ProtagonistA was different , ProtagonistA was always happy and always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA was always quick to make friends and was always the life of the party 
 ProtagonistA was always there for ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB needed someone to talk to 
 ProtagonistA had been using it to terrorize the villagers , but ProtagonistB had been determined to stop ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been thinking all night and ProtagonistA 'd been stumped ever since 
 ProtagonistA just could n't figure out what to get ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's birthday 
 ProtagonistA was starting to get frustrated 
 ProtagonistA got up from the table and paced around the room 
 Maybe ProtagonistA could go for a walk and clear ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA could get ProtagonistB a gift certificate to ProtagonistB's favorite store 
 ProtagonistA was so happy with ProtagonistA's idea that ProtagonistA went to the store right away and got the certificate 
ProtagonistA had been very wrong in ProtagonistA's belief that I would ever be with anyone , or marry anyone 
 ProtagonistA had seen me with many different men over the years , and I had never been serious with any of them 
 ProtagonistA just assumed that I would never settle down 
 ProtagonistA was at our wedding and ProtagonistA was happy for me , even though ProtagonistA had been wrong about me 
ProtagonistA was out for a walk in the woods when ProtagonistA came across a bush 
 ProtagonistA had never seen ProtagonistB before , but ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB somewhere before 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA was out for a walk and enjoying the nature 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but then ProtagonistA agreed 
 ProtagonistA went first 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB's name was 
 ProtagonistA then asked ProtagonistB where ProtagonistB lived 
 ProtagonistA was about to ask another question when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had won the game 
 This time , ProtagonistA was going on about the time ProtagonistA had met ProtagonistB 
 It was the most amazing thing that has ever happened to ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA was just walking along , minding ProtagonistA's own business , when ProtagonistA came across a lamp 
 ProtagonistA picked it up and rubbed it , and out popped ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to wish for at first , but then ProtagonistA thought of the perfect thing 
 ProtagonistA wished that ProtagonistA could always make speeches like a genius 
 And , granted , ever since then ProtagonistA 've been able to do just that 
 ProtagonistA can stand up in front of any audience and just speak off the top of ProtagonistA's head , and they 'll all be hanging on ProtagonistA's every word 
ProtagonistA was in a large room on the first floor 
 ProtagonistA was happy to be left alone in the room and ProtagonistA soon fell asleep 
ProtagonistA was walking through town on the left hand side of the road when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA stopped and stared for a moment 
 ProtagonistA was so confused and curious that ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB for a few blocks until ProtagonistB turned down an alleyway 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then decided to follow ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA turned down the alley , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB talking to a man in the shadows 
 ProtagonistA was so scared that ProtagonistA turned and ran the other way 
 ProtagonistA did n't stop running until ProtagonistA got home 
 ProtagonistA was so breathless and panting that ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA tried to tell ProtagonistC about ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was so shaken up that ProtagonistA could n't get the words out 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB's face 
ProtagonistA had been in prison for years , and ProtagonistA was getting tired of it 
 ProtagonistA had tried to escape a few times , but it never worked 
 One day , ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's cell , wondering if there was anything left for ProtagonistA in the world 
 ProtagonistA was getting old , and ProtagonistA did n't know how much longer ProtagonistA could take it 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise outside ProtagonistA's cell 
 ProtagonistA got up to see what it was , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB coming towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew what that meant 
 ProtagonistA was going to be executed 
 ProtagonistA had heard of prisoners being executed before , and ProtagonistA did n't want to die 
 ProtagonistA begged ProtagonistB to let ProtagonistA go , but ProtagonistB just laughed and said ,  Sorry , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 're going to have to face the consequences of ProtagonistA's actions 
 ProtagonistA knew that was going to be ProtagonistA's fate 
 ProtagonistA was strapped into the chair , and the last thing ProtagonistA heard was ProtagonistB saying ,  Sleeping is a bitch , said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistB opened the door of ProtagonistA's old , badly needed and ragged cell 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a pair of dirty jeans and a stained white t - shirt 
 ProtagonistA had been living like this for months , ever since ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's job and ProtagonistA's wife had left ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't see the point in carrying on anymore 
 All ProtagonistA wanted to do was drink and watch TV 
 ProtagonistA did n't care about anything else 
 ProtagonistA had finally reached the end of ProtagonistA's rope 
 ProtagonistA had given up on life 
 ProtagonistA is ready to go now 
 But before ProtagonistA leaves , ProtagonistA wants to say goodbye to ProtagonistA's co - workers 
 ProtagonistA walks around the office , shaking hands and saying ProtagonistA's goodbyes 
 As ProtagonistA walks out the door , ProtagonistA hears someone call ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA is surprised and happy 
ProtagonistA rode out into the great wide plain of Phlegethon with Sarah , the little princess , at ProtagonistA's side 
 ProtagonistA found the rest of ProtagonistA's family in the company of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was always merry in ProtagonistB's company , and ProtagonistB was the cause of much expense to Dave 's owing to the imprudence of he 
 ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's belongings and set off into the stormy night , not knowing where ProtagonistA would go or what would become of ProtagonistA 
 Thankfully , ProtagonistA made it safely out of the country and into hiding , just as the king 's troops arrived to arrest ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA went on to live a long and prosperous life , thanks to the warning ProtagonistA had received on that dark and stormy night 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's late seventies , and all ProtagonistA's friends had long since died 
 ProtagonistA was the last man standing , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would n't have long left 
 But ProtagonistA could still remember the last time ProtagonistA had sex 
 ProtagonistA had been at a party , and ProtagonistB had been there with ProtagonistB's boyfriend 
 ProtagonistA had n't been able to resist 
 ProtagonistA had been gentle with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB had seemed to enjoy it 
 But ProtagonistA had never forgotten ProtagonistB 
The great dream — the thing ProtagonistA should never have taken the risk of doing — the wish , that great wish , that frightful wish , that terrible wish , that terrible wish — that was something ProtagonistA never would have done , if ProtagonistA had not met ProtagonistB , and — And then ProtagonistA drank to the full 
 One day , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the great dream ProtagonistA had , the one ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA could never make come true 
 Encouraged by ProtagonistB's faith in ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA took the risk 
 ProtagonistA had the worst fear of anything in the world , and the most abiding love of anything in the world to abandon 
 ProtagonistA fancied ProtagonistA had seen everything when ProtagonistA was a little old man 
 When ProtagonistA was younger , ProtagonistA had seen the world and all its wonders 
 ProtagonistA had seen the beauty of the sunsets and the majesty of the mountains 
 ProtagonistA had seen the kindness of strangers and the love of friends 
 But as ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to see the ugliness of the world 
 ProtagonistA saw the cruelty of people and the violence of nature 
 ProtagonistA saw the poverty and the disease 
 ProtagonistA saw the hatred and the bigotry 
 And ProtagonistA saw the death and destruction 
 ProtagonistA was afraid that ProtagonistA would die without ever having experienced true love or happiness 
 So ProtagonistA decided to abandon everything and go off into the world to find ProtagonistA's true purpose 
 ProtagonistA traveled to many different places and ProtagonistA saw many different things 
 But no matter where ProtagonistA went , ProtagonistA could n't find what ProtagonistA was looking for 
 ProtagonistA began to lose hope and ProtagonistA became very depressed 
 But one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's story and ProtagonistB listened 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been looking for something in the wrong places 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's advice and ProtagonistA went on ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA continued ProtagonistA's journey and ProtagonistA eventually found what ProtagonistA was looking for 
 ProtagonistA found happiness and love 
 And ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer , and when ProtagonistA was younger ProtagonistA would often spend hours in the garden , imagining what it would be like to build ProtagonistA's own house there 
 ProtagonistA spent months working on the house , and when it was finished ProtagonistA was very proud of it 
 ProtagonistA was unaware of ProtagonistB's presence , and ProtagonistA went about ProtagonistA's life as usual 
 ProtagonistA worked hard , and ProtagonistA played hard 
 ProtagonistA made friends and enemies 
 ProtagonistA laughed and ProtagonistA cried 
 ProtagonistA achieved great things , and ProtagonistA made mistakes 
 But through it all , ProtagonistA remained the same dreamer ProtagonistA had always been 
 ProtagonistA was an old man then , but ProtagonistA still had a twinkle in ProtagonistA's eye 
ProtagonistA was the god of the seas , and a man like ProtagonistB had a hard time determining ProtagonistB's true identity 
ProtagonistA was a simple man who lived a simple life 
 ProtagonistA worked hard to support ProtagonistA's family and never asked for anything in return 
 So when ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB wanted a new dress , ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to go out and buy it for ProtagonistB 
 Little did ProtagonistA know that the dress would cost ProtagonistA more than just money 
 ProtagonistA begrudgingly handed over the money and went home , feeling like ProtagonistA 'd been taken advantage of 
 But ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like ProtagonistA 'd been duped 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA 'd never be able to look at that dress the same way again 
ProtagonistA was a simple man , and ProtagonistA found great comfort in the simple things in life 
 One of ProtagonistA's favorite things to do was to read The Origin of Species , and ProtagonistA was particularly fond of the appendix 
 On this particular afternoon , ProtagonistA was working ProtagonistA's way through the appendix , and ProtagonistA was so engrossed in it that ProtagonistA did n't even notice the cold January weather 
 When ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was startled , and ProtagonistA quickly got to ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what to make of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was something important 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , so ProtagonistA just stood there and waited 
 ProtagonistA was surprised , but ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to help 
 ProtagonistA agreed to go with ProtagonistB , and the two of them set off on their adventure 
 ProtagonistA had never been on a horse before , and ProtagonistA was amazed at how fast they could go 
 ProtagonistA could see the smoke rising from the chimneys , and ProtagonistA could hear the sound of gunfire in the distance 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how they were going to do that , but ProtagonistA trust ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to help 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB worked together to stop the fighting , and eventually they were successful 
 ProtagonistA was a hero , and ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistA's adventure with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a dull boy , but not to the point of being a loner , except in the locality where ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , an aunt , and a cousin ; and as ProtagonistA was such a person , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA quite agreeable to everybody , even to the great majority of ProtagonistA's elders 
 However , there was one thing that ProtagonistA was very particular about , and that was ProtagonistA's hair 
 ProtagonistA was always very careful to keep it neat and tidy , and ProtagonistA never allowed anybody to touch it 
  ProtagonistA do n't know ,  ProtagonistA replied 
  ProtagonistA just felt like it 
 But today , ProtagonistA was late 
 ProtagonistA had only been in the small town for a few weeks , but it seemed like everyone knew who ProtagonistA was and where ProtagonistA was from 
 ProtagonistA tried to keep to ProtagonistA , but it was difficult when everyone was always talking about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt like a zoo animal on display 
 ProtagonistA was polite , but ProtagonistA just wanted to finish ProtagonistA's shopping and go home 
 As ProtagonistA was leaving , ProtagonistA overheard ProtagonistB whispering to the customer next to ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA 's from that country that 's always in the news 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's face flush with anger , but ProtagonistA just gritted ProtagonistA's teeth and walked out of the store 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being judged and talked about 
 ProtagonistA was just a person , just like everyone else 
 The next day , ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's belongings and left the town 
 ProtagonistA was done with being the center of attention and ProtagonistA did n't want to be anywhere that ProtagonistA was n't welcome 
ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , and when ProtagonistA was five years old ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB a name 
 ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB ProtagonistB because ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's favorite name 
ProtagonistA had been sitting in ProtagonistA's study for hours , looking at the old book that was lying on the table in front of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been flipping through its pages slowly , taking in the words and the pictures 
 ProtagonistA had been studying it intently , trying to make sense of it all 
 But now , as the night began to fall , ProtagonistA was starting to feel tired 
 ProtagonistA decided to put the book away and get some sleep 
 But as ProtagonistA reached for it , ProtagonistA heard a noise outside 
 ProtagonistA got up to see what was going on and found ProtagonistA in the Court of the Tuileries 
 ProtagonistA recognized the body as ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA had gotten there , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was dead 
 ProtagonistA could see the light starting to fade from ProtagonistA's own eyes 
 But as ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA felt a sudden surge of love and compassion for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA 
 And in that moment , ProtagonistA was content 
One day , soon after ProtagonistA had become a full - grown man , Mr
  ProtagonistA never heard of ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a very distrustful person 
 ProtagonistA never trusted anyone , not even in the most extreme times of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA always thought that people were out to get ProtagonistA and that they would take advantage of ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA let them 
 ProtagonistA was always afraid that they would hurt ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking through the forest and ProtagonistA came across a small cottage 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant to trust ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was very tired and thirsty 
 ProtagonistA decided to take a chance and ProtagonistA went inside 
 ProtagonistA was so grateful that ProtagonistA decided to trust ProtagonistB 
 From then on , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB became good friends 
 ProtagonistA would visit ProtagonistB often and ProtagonistB would help ProtagonistA through ProtagonistA's tough times 
 ProtagonistA was very grateful to ProtagonistB for everything ProtagonistB had done for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been driving for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting tired 
 ProtagonistA had been on the road for days , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA was going insane 
 ProtagonistA could see the wheel in front of ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA could n't keep ProtagonistA's hands on it 
 ProtagonistA was getting so tired that ProtagonistA started to see things that were n't there 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB in the road , and ProtagonistA swerved to avoid ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA lost control of the car and it went off the road 
 ProtagonistA hit a tree and was killed instantly 
There was once a boy who was known to everyone but Bob by ProtagonistA's given name – a boy called Noah , who was supposed to have been born in the year 1224 , on the very day that ProtagonistA was , according to some versions , murdered by a demon 
 ProtagonistA was a happy child , always smiling and laughing , and everyone who met ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to take care of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB passed away a few months later 
 ProtagonistA was now all alone in the world 
 ProtagonistA had no family and no home 
 ProtagonistA wandered the streets , begging for food and sleeping in doorways 
 One winter , ProtagonistA became very ill 
 ProtagonistA lay down in a doorway and curled up in a ball , trying to keep warm 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die 
 As ProtagonistA lay there , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was too weak to move , and so ProtagonistA just lay there , staring at ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA was too weak to resist , and so ProtagonistA just nodded 
 When ProtagonistC stood up , ProtagonistA felt different 
 ProtagonistA felt stronger and healthier 
 ProtagonistA sat up and looked at ProtagonistC 
  Thank ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 're welcome , ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been sailing the East India ocean for years , and ProtagonistA had never seen a more beautiful sight than ProtagonistB 
 Cecil was ProtagonistB's name , and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistA ran into ProtagonistB again on a stormy night , when the waves were crashing and the wind was howling 
 ProtagonistA searched for ProtagonistB for weeks , but ProtagonistA was never able to find ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA always wondered what happened to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA vowed to never forget ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC was also very kind and ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistC loved ProtagonistB very much 
 ProtagonistA had a wife and two kids , and ProtagonistA worked at a bank 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking to work , when ProtagonistA saw a $ 20 bill on the ground 
 ProtagonistA picked it up , and ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA ran all the way to work to tell ProtagonistB about it 
 ProtagonistA did n't know whether to believe ProtagonistB or not , but ProtagonistA decided to go along with it 
 After all , what did ProtagonistA have to lose?So ProtagonistA went along with ProtagonistB's plan , and soon ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA ruling the universe 
 ProtagonistA made the best of it , just as ProtagonistB had said ProtagonistA would 
 And ProtagonistA ruled it well , for many years 
 But then one day , ProtagonistA began to doubt ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA began to wonder if ProtagonistA really was a god , or if ProtagonistA was just a man who had been lucky enough to find himself in a position of power 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistA really was a god 
 ProtagonistA 've always been a god 
 ProtagonistA just did n't know it until now 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was a god , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would always be one 
ProtagonistA was dead , and ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a man , or at least ProtagonistA looked like one , of unquestionable fortune 
 ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB and three kids that ProtagonistA loved dearly , and a job that paid ProtagonistA well 
 But ProtagonistA was a man with a secret 
 ProtagonistA was also a woman 
 For as long as ProtagonistA could remember , ProtagonistA had felt like ProtagonistA was in the wrong body 
 ProtagonistA had never told anyone about ProtagonistA's secret , but ProtagonistA had always known that ProtagonistA was a woman trapped in a man 's body 
 ProtagonistA had never been comfortable in ProtagonistA's own skin , and ProtagonistA had always felt like ProtagonistA was playing a role 
 ProtagonistA was a good husband and father , but ProtagonistA always felt like something was missing 
 It was a difficult process , but ProtagonistA was finally able to live ProtagonistA's life authentically 
 ProtagonistA was happier than ProtagonistA had ever been , and ProtagonistA's family was by ProtagonistA's side every step of the way 
ProtagonistA was in a dream in which ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but then ProtagonistA agreed 
 When ProtagonistA awoke , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA was transformed into a god 
There was ProtagonistA in a village where ProtagonistA had no name , and from whence ProtagonistA looked no more than a village - name ; and ProtagonistA was well known to everybody , and was a good , honest boy in everything 
 But one day , ProtagonistA went to the village where ProtagonistA had no name , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB there who was also well known to everybody 
 And ProtagonistB said to ProtagonistA ,  Why are ProtagonistA here ? ProtagonistA have no name 
  And ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA am looking for a name 
ProtagonistA had always loved coming to ProtagonistA's cabin on the lake 
 ProtagonistA felt at ease and just took in the beauty around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt grateful for all that ProtagonistA had in life 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a loud noise coming from the other side of the lake 
 ProtagonistA quickly ran towards the noise and saw ProtagonistB struggling to stay afloat 
 ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to jump in and save ProtagonistB 
 After getting ProtagonistB to safety , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel shaken 
 It was a close call and ProtagonistA was just happy that ProtagonistA was able to help 
 ProtagonistA realized that this was a reminder to always be grateful for what ProtagonistA had in life and to always be ready to help others in need 
In the year of our Lord 1849 , in the month of May , ProtagonistA came to the door of the house at 14 James Street , and said ProtagonistA was going to Washington to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA had always been interested in politics and ProtagonistA thought it would be a once in a lifetime opportunity to see ProtagonistB in person 
 ProtagonistA set out on ProtagonistA's journey and arrived in Washington a few days later 
 ProtagonistA went to the White House and requested a meeting with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA had traveled all the way from Massachusetts to see ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA was n't going to leave until ProtagonistA got a chance to speak with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB spoke for a few minutes about politics and the current state of the country 
 ProtagonistA returned home to Massachusetts and told ProtagonistC all about ProtagonistA's journey and ProtagonistA's meeting with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was an orphan who lived in a very poor village 
 ProtagonistA always kept to ProtagonistA and never talked to anyone in the village 
 ProtagonistA agreed and ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a bag of gold 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA went to the nearest town and bought ProtagonistA a new set of clothes and a horse 
 ProtagonistA rode back to ProtagonistA's village and showed off ProtagonistA's new riches 
 ProtagonistA just smiled and said that ProtagonistA was a very lucky man 
ProtagonistA had been on ProtagonistA's usual wife - beating sprawl for hours , after how deeply ProtagonistA had been in debt and wasted luxury 
 ProtagonistA had been hitting ProtagonistB for days , and ProtagonistB was getting tired of it 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do without ProtagonistB 
In the year 1882 , ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB -- at Ull - west in the province of Wales 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had a very happy life together 
 ProtagonistA was planning on asking ProtagonistB to marry ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
ProtagonistA was a simple man who lived a simple life 
 ProtagonistA worked hard to support ProtagonistA's family and always tried to do what was right 
 However , ProtagonistA possessed a power that ProtagonistA did n't fully understand 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to lose ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB's time was coming to an end 
 That night , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's bedside and held ProtagonistB's hand as ProtagonistB passed away 
 As ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistB's life force leave ProtagonistB's body , ProtagonistA used ProtagonistA's power to keep the angel of death at bay 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure how long ProtagonistA could keep the angel at bay , but ProtagonistA was determined to keep ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA for as long as possible 
 For weeks , ProtagonistA kept the angel of death at bay 
 ProtagonistA did n't leave ProtagonistB's side , even for a moment 
 ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA did , the angel would take ProtagonistB from ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was a traffic cruiser in a early - nineteenth - century British town 
 ProtagonistA observed ProtagonistB as ProtagonistB went about ProtagonistB's business at the Hyatt Regency 
 ProtagonistA decided to follow ProtagonistB one night to see what ProtagonistB was up to 
 ProtagonistA reported ProtagonistA's findings to Lord Curzon , and ProtagonistB was arrested soon afterwards 
 There , ProtagonistA was a very wealthy man 
 ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB and two healthy children 
 ProtagonistA owned a successful business and had a nice home in the suburbs 
 ProtagonistA was a happy man 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB and did n't want to lose ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was lonely and miserable 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do without ProtagonistA's family 
 One day , ProtagonistA came into work and announced that ProtagonistA was selling the business 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA needed to start over and did n't want to be a businessman anymore 
 ProtagonistA moved to a small town and bought a farm 
 ProtagonistA started a new life , surrounded by nature and animals 
 ProtagonistA was happy and at peace 
 ProtagonistA was no longer the stressed - out businessman they remembered 
 ProtagonistA was happy and content 
ProtagonistA was the youngest of thirty - four children , born fourteen years after ProtagonistA's parents had arrived in Melbourne from England 
 ProtagonistA had been a happy and contented child , surrounded by a large and loving family 
 ProtagonistA had never wanted for anything and had always been well cared for 
 Despite the challenges , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's sisters grew up to be happy and successful adults 
ProtagonistA had been living in Paris for two weeks , when ProtagonistA began to hear about a murder in Paris 
 ProtagonistA had never felt unsafe in Paris before , but now ProtagonistA was beginning to feel like ProtagonistA was in danger 
 ProtagonistA decided to leave the city and go back to the United States 
 The middle age is the hardest age for any man , and not for the better , said ProtagonistA , for it is some years after the death of ProtagonistA's parents , that ProtagonistA come to the conclusion that the whole of humanity has become the same age , or , at best , a very long time into it 
 ProtagonistA lived alone in a small house , and spent ProtagonistA's days gardening and reading 
 ProtagonistA was a contented man , but the feeling that ProtagonistA was the only one getting older had begun to weigh on ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA went for a walk in the park , and saw a young couple sitting on a bench 
 As ProtagonistA watched them , ProtagonistA felt a pang of envy 
 ProtagonistA turned away , and walked home 
 As ProtagonistA went , ProtagonistA passed a group of young people , and ProtagonistA heard them laughing 
 When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's bedroom , and lay down on ProtagonistA's bed 
 ProtagonistA stared up at the ceiling , and felt tears welling up in ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA got up , and went downstairs to the kitchen 
 ProtagonistA took a knife from the drawer , and walked back upstairs 
 ProtagonistA stood over ProtagonistA's bed , and looked down at ProtagonistA's body 
 ProtagonistA was an old man , and ProtagonistA had lived a good life 
 ProtagonistA raised the knife , and plunged it into ProtagonistA's chest 
 As ProtagonistA felt the life ebbing away from ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA had a vision of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes , and died 
 ProtagonistA had found a cache of documents , hidden away in a secret room in ProtagonistB's palace 
  ProtagonistA 'm just happy ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'm going to tell ProtagonistB what ProtagonistA really think of ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
   ProtagonistA do n't care ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'm not going to take it anymore 
ProtagonistA was walking home from school one day when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing on the side of the road 
 ProtagonistA thought for a moment and then said that ProtagonistA wanted to be the richest man in the world 
 ProtagonistA went home and told ProtagonistA's parents about ProtagonistA's wish , and they laughed and said that ProtagonistA was just being silly 
 ProtagonistA did n't believe them , and sure enough , the next day ProtagonistA woke up to find that ProtagonistA was the richest man in the world 
 ProtagonistA had more money than ProtagonistA could ever spend , and ProtagonistA lived a life of luxury from then on 
 ProtagonistA denied the rumor , but no one believed ProtagonistA 
 At ProtagonistA's trial , ProtagonistA maintained ProtagonistA's innocence , but the evidence was overwhelming 
 Now , ProtagonistA spends ProtagonistA's days in a small cell , with only ProtagonistA's thoughts for company 
 ProtagonistA thinks about the what - ifs and the could - have - beens 
 But most of all , ProtagonistA thinks about the family ProtagonistA destroyed and the life ProtagonistA will never have again 
A hundred years ago , in the year 1873 , ProtagonistA happened within the city of Detroit 
 ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was sad to hear this news , but ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistB well 
 ProtagonistA was skeptical at first , but ProtagonistB was adamant that ProtagonistC would bring peace and prosperity to the land 
 ProtagonistA did as ProtagonistA was told , and the people began to get excited about the prospect of ProtagonistC 
ProtagonistA died on a rainy day in 19 , 18 , so ProtagonistA was about 21 when I was born 
 ProtagonistA loved the outdoors and went on hikes and camping trips often 
ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA's feet were starting to hurt 
 ProtagonistA had been careful to avoid the worst of the traffic , but the narrow streets of Copenhagen were still crowded 
 ProtagonistA was getting hungry , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA did n't have much money left 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up and go back to ProtagonistA's room when ProtagonistA saw a sign for a bakery 
 ProtagonistA decided to go in and see if they had anything ProtagonistA could afford 
 ProtagonistA was about to leave when ProtagonistB spoke again 
 ProtagonistA handed ProtagonistB the money and thanked ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was about to leave when ProtagonistA saw a sign for a free lunch 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA's luck ! ProtagonistA went in and got ProtagonistA a bowl of soup and a piece of bread 
 ProtagonistA sat down at a table and ate ProtagonistA's lunch , feeling grateful for the kindness of strangers 
ProtagonistA , lamented that ProtagonistB's profession had become so irrelevant , and had become so feeble and uncertain , that ProtagonistA no longer felt ProtagonistA bound to contact it with any amount of importance 
 ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB's work first hand and knew that ProtagonistB was not cut out for the job 
 ProtagonistA had tried to talk to ProtagonistB about it , to see if there was anything that could be done to help ProtagonistB , but it was like talking to a wall 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA just stopped talking to ProtagonistB altogether 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to see ProtagonistB's decline anymore 
 ProtagonistA wanted to remember the Bob ProtagonistA used to know , the Bob who was passionate about ProtagonistB's work and who made a difference 
 But even though ProtagonistA stopped talking to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA still thought about ProtagonistB often 
 ProtagonistA wondered how ProtagonistB was doing and if ProtagonistB was still in the profession 
 ProtagonistA hoped that ProtagonistB had found something else that made ProtagonistB happy , something that was more fulfilling than ProtagonistB's work as a physician 
ProtagonistA was in the kitchen making tea for the family when ProtagonistA was startled to discover that ProtagonistB had gone into labour 
 ProtagonistA quickly called for an ambulance and ProtagonistB was rushed to the hospital 
 ProtagonistA was by ProtagonistB's side the whole time , holding ProtagonistB's hand and telling ProtagonistB everything would be alright 
ProtagonistA had been using ProtagonistA's hearing to the full when ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had to be able to hear ProtagonistB's heart beating , to feel the warmth of ProtagonistB's blood on ProtagonistA's hands , to smell the fear in ProtagonistB's sweat 
 In the days before ProtagonistA's death , as the fever raged through ProtagonistA's body , ProtagonistA had visions 
 ProtagonistA saw Jesus Christ himself , and ProtagonistA saw the gates of Heaven open before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's deceased loved ones , and they called out to ProtagonistA , beckoning ProtagonistA to come with them 
 And in ProtagonistA's final moments , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
The night ProtagonistA was arrested , ProtagonistA awoke to find ProtagonistA in a cell with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was asleep , so ProtagonistA could n't tell what ProtagonistB looked like 
 ProtagonistA wondered how ProtagonistA had gotten there 
 ProtagonistA must have been drugged , ProtagonistA thought 
 ProtagonistA tried to stand up , but ProtagonistA's legs were weak and ProtagonistA fell back down onto the hard bench 
 ProtagonistA looked around the cell for a way to escape , but there was none 
 ProtagonistA would have to wait until morning to find out what was going on 
ProtagonistA had never known the heart of a woman , and ProtagonistA did not even pretend to be surprised at ProtagonistB's romance 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit suspicious of ProtagonistB's husband , Mr
 ProtagonistA was happy to be ProtagonistB's confidant and friend , and ProtagonistA listened to ProtagonistB's stories of ProtagonistB's romance with great interest 
 ProtagonistA was a little bit jealous of the man ProtagonistB was seeing , but ProtagonistA was also happy for ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was going to China , but first ProtagonistA was going to see ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistB's house , ProtagonistA was surprised to see how much it had changed 
  ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA 'm here 
 ProtagonistA sat down in the chair next to ProtagonistB and watched ProtagonistB's sleep 
ProtagonistA had been reading aloud from the ' History of the United States of America ' when ProtagonistA noticed a word in a Latin text on the back page 
 ProtagonistA wondered if the word meant ' forever ' in Latin , and if so , whether ProtagonistB had known that ProtagonistA would one day be reading about the history of the United States in a Latin text 
ProtagonistA approached the throne upon an armchair not as a king , but as a dandy , ProtagonistA a success , but no more than a short - cut , with ProtagonistB at full term , ProtagonistA sat down to lunch , and took a stool in the sofas on the other side of the table 
 ProtagonistA had been planning to leave ProtagonistB for weeks , but now that ProtagonistB was pregnant , ProtagonistA did n't have the heart to do it 
 So ProtagonistA sat there , eating ProtagonistA's lunch and looking at ProtagonistB , wondering how ProtagonistA could ever leave ProtagonistB 
There was once ProtagonistA , for there can be no doubt that it was to ProtagonistA a kind of great privilege and a great misfortune that ProtagonistA was to have lived until the day ProtagonistA died a free man 
 When ProtagonistA was sixteen , ProtagonistA ran away from home and joined the army 
 ProtagonistA served ProtagonistA's country for four years , and then ProtagonistA was honorably discharged 
 ProtagonistA returned home , but ProtagonistA could not find a place in society 
 ProtagonistA was a man without a country , without a home 
 ProtagonistA wandered the streets , living off the charity of others 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA went to the address ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA at the doorstep of a brothel 
 ProtagonistA went inside , and ProtagonistA was given a room and a bed 
 ProtagonistA was happy there , and ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA had found a home 
 For the first time , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB leave the house , bundled up in a heavy coat and scarf 
 ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB walked down the street , looking around at the snow - covered houses and trees 
 ProtagonistA was curious to know what had prompted ProtagonistB to finally leave the house after all these years 
 ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB at a distance , not wanting to intrude on whatever it was that ProtagonistB was doing 
 ProtagonistA was surprised when ProtagonistB turned down a street that ProtagonistA had never been down before 
 ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB , but this time ProtagonistB did n't seem to notice ProtagonistA 
 It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever seen ProtagonistB leave the house , and ProtagonistA was n't sure what to make of it 
 Was it the first step of ProtagonistB coming out of ProtagonistB's shell , or was it simply a one - time thing ? Either way , ProtagonistA was happy to have seen ProtagonistB finally venture out into the world 
ProtagonistA was always different 
 ProtagonistA did n't share a room with your mom or your brother or any of that stuff that everybody does 
 ProtagonistA was always alone , and ProtagonistA liked it that way 
 ProtagonistA did n't need anybody else 
 ProtagonistA met somebody who changed ProtagonistA's whole perspective on life 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA did n't want to be alone anymore 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be with this person all the time 
ProtagonistA was having a great day 
 ProtagonistA woke up early and went for a run , then ate a healthy breakfast 
 ProtagonistA was about to head out the door when ProtagonistA got a call from ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA agreed , and within an hour , ProtagonistB was at ProtagonistA's door 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong , but ProtagonistB did n't answer 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistB had tried to kill ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB why , but ProtagonistB did n't have an answer 
 But ProtagonistA do n't think ProtagonistA can ever forget what ProtagonistB did 
ProtagonistA was sitting on ProtagonistA's bed , knitting a sweater for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been working on it for weeks , and it was finally finished 
 ProtagonistA was just about to put the finishing touches on it when ProtagonistA heard a knock at ProtagonistA's door 
 ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and there was ProtagonistB , standing there with a big smile on ProtagonistB's face 
 ProtagonistA sat back down on ProtagonistA's bed , a satisfied smile on ProtagonistA's face 
ProtagonistA was sitting cross - legged on the edge of the porch , ProtagonistA's eyes fixed on the tree closest to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 've been sitting out here for a while , and ProtagonistB was starting to worry 
 ProtagonistA smiled 
 Well , ProtagonistA be sure to come inside if ProtagonistA get too hot 
 ProtagonistA will 
 ProtagonistA turned back to the tree , and ProtagonistB went back inside ProtagonistB's house 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistA's son , Tim 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistA's daughter , Emily 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA smiled 
 Well , ProtagonistA be sure to come inside if ProtagonistA get too cold 
 ProtagonistA will 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA smiled 
 Well , ProtagonistA be sure to come inside if ProtagonistA get too cold 
 ProtagonistA will 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA smiled 
 Well , ProtagonistA be sure to come inside if ProtagonistA get too cold 
 ProtagonistA will 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistA's son , Tim 
 ProtagonistA smiled 
ProtagonistA had always been a bookworm , so it was no surprise that ProtagonistA's favorite spot to relax was in ProtagonistA's library 
 ProtagonistA had every book imaginable , and ProtagonistA loved them all equally 
 But as ProtagonistA sat there , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little sad 
 ProtagonistA was always the one who was short on time , and ProtagonistA never had enough time to read all of ProtagonistA's books 
 But ProtagonistA was content , because at least ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA just kept spinning , faster and faster , until ProtagonistA was a blur 
 Finally , ProtagonistA stopped and collapsed to the ground , panting 
 ProtagonistB rushed to ProtagonistA's side , but ProtagonistA just laughed and said ,  That was fun ! Can ProtagonistA do it again ?  
 Even when ProtagonistA was at ProtagonistA's worst , ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA 
 It was because of this that ProtagonistA was able to get through some of the hardest times in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA is grateful for ProtagonistB's guidance and support throughout ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes and ProtagonistB had been pacing the downstairs hallway for hours , still staring up at the giant dragon sitting on the doorstep 
 ProtagonistA sighed 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was n't going to budge until ProtagonistB got ProtagonistB's cupcake , so ProtagonistA might as well give in and get ProtagonistB's one 
 ProtagonistA went to the kitchen and got a cupcake from the cupcake tree 
 ProtagonistA just shook ProtagonistA's head and went back to the kitchen 
 ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes and ProtagonistB had a dragon on the doorstep , but at least ProtagonistB was happy 
Sometime in the early seventies ProtagonistA was working at a dress shop when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB working there 
 One day , ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB how ProtagonistB liked working at the dress shop 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to hear this and asked ProtagonistB why ProtagonistB liked it so much 
 ProtagonistB said yes and ProtagonistA was happy to have ProtagonistB on board 
From the top of a high mountain , ProtagonistA , naturally , waited for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be coming soon and ProtagonistA wanted to be the first one to greet ProtagonistB 
 As ProtagonistA waited , ProtagonistA could n't help but think about all the things they had been through together 
 ProtagonistA remembered the time when they were both lost in the forest and how ProtagonistB had found the way back home 
 ProtagonistA also remembered the time when ProtagonistB had saved ProtagonistA from a group of bullies 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA , no matter what 
 Finally , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB coming up the path 
 I'm glad to see ProtagonistB too , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA was tired from ProtagonistA's journey and wanted to rest , but ProtagonistA could not 
 ProtagonistA was too anxious about what lay ahead 
 ProtagonistA had to be brave 
 ProtagonistA stood up and continued ProtagonistA's search 
ProtagonistA had just finished eating dinner with ProtagonistA's family and was walking down the aisle of the car park of the local church when the first thing ProtagonistA noticed was ProtagonistB looking back at ProtagonistA from the rear window 
 ProtagonistA agreed to help , and the two of them walked to ProtagonistB's car 
 ProtagonistA agreed to help ProtagonistB get the story published 
ProtagonistA had been thinking all day if ProtagonistA 'd ever had the chance to speak to ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB dearly and regretted not speaking to ProtagonistB more often when ProtagonistB was alive 
 ProtagonistA was so grateful to have the chance to speak to ProtagonistB again and tell ProtagonistB how much ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had never been a particularly violent person 
 In fact , in ProtagonistA's younger and more vulnerable years , ProtagonistA had never held a weapon above ProtagonistA's head 
 Now , ProtagonistA was no longer a pushover 
 ProtagonistA was a man to be reckoned with 
One morning , as the sun was leaking its last faint rays , ProtagonistA heard the bell ring , and while ProtagonistA was still in the kitchen preparing the breakfast that ProtagonistA 'd have for ProtagonistA's grandkids for the holidays , ProtagonistA was n't looking out of the kitchen window 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and went back inside , thinking ProtagonistA must be getting old and senile 
 But then ProtagonistA noticed that the window in the living room was open , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had n't left it that way 
 ProtagonistA quickly ran to the window and looked out , but there was no sign of anyone 
 ProtagonistA was about to call the police when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the kitchen 
 Someone was still in ProtagonistA's house ! ProtagonistA crept quietly towards the kitchen , heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest , and peeked around the corner 
 ProtagonistA was about to call out to ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB suddenly turned around , and their eyes met 
 ProtagonistA was just glad ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistA went to the window and looked out one last time , but there was still no sign of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA sighed and went back to the kitchen to finish making breakfast for ProtagonistA's grandkids 
 ProtagonistA 's laughing ProtagonistA's butt off 
 ProtagonistB 's just standing there , looking at ProtagonistA like ProtagonistA 's crazy 
 ProtagonistA 's just happy to be there , with ProtagonistB , in the moment 
ProtagonistA lay down on ProtagonistA's hooves and reached for ProtagonistA's glass of juice 
 ProtagonistA was a little horse , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's juice 
 ProtagonistA drank it all the time 
 But today , ProtagonistA did n't feel so good 
 ProtagonistA tried to drink ProtagonistA's juice , but ProtagonistA could n't keep it down 
 ProtagonistA lay there for a while , feeling sick 
 Then ProtagonistA heard someone coming 
 Soon , ProtagonistA was back to drinking ProtagonistA's juice and being ProtagonistA's happy self again 
ProtagonistA was asleep and thinking about food when ProtagonistA awoke to the sound of hooves approaching from behind the deep , dark , still trees of Equestria 
 ProtagonistA slowly stood up , ProtagonistA's stomach grumbling , and turned to see ProtagonistB trotting towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA sat down and began munching on the juicy apples , feeling grateful for ProtagonistB's help 
ProtagonistA had had enough of telling ProtagonistB's story for a while now 
 ProtagonistA had heard it so many times that ProtagonistA could recite it ProtagonistA 
 And every time , ProtagonistA would oblige 
 But today , ProtagonistA had had enough 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to hear the story again 
 ProtagonistA wanted to do something else 
 ProtagonistA 'm tired of it 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to hurt ProtagonistB's feelings 
 And so , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB spent the day doing other things together 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a dirty , ragged tunic , and ProtagonistA's hair was matted and greasy 
 ProtagonistA looked like a wild animal , and the crowd jeered and booed as ProtagonistA was led to the stand 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was innocent , and ProtagonistA was determined to prove it 
  ProtagonistA am innocent of all charges !  ProtagonistA shouted 
 ProtagonistA are just as guilty as ProtagonistB was 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head 
  No , ProtagonistA am not ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA swear , on ProtagonistA's honor , that ProtagonistA am innocent 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had done nothing wrong , and ProtagonistA was determined to prove ProtagonistA's innocence 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and watched from behind the large , open window of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been following the herd of wild horses for days , and they had finally led ProtagonistA to their hidden valley 
 Now ProtagonistA just had to wait for the right moment to make ProtagonistA's move 
 ProtagonistA watched as the herd grazed and played , their bodies shining in the sunlight 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would have to be careful , as these horses were wild and unpredictable 
 But ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA could not let this opportunity pass ProtagonistA by 
 Finally , when the herd was resting in the shade of a grove of trees , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's move 
 ProtagonistA quietly approached ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA slowly reached out ProtagonistA's hand to touch ProtagonistB's soft nose , and ProtagonistB did not shy away 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's new home 
ProtagonistA had seen the white sapland before , but ProtagonistA had n't known what it was , or why people did what they did 
 ProtagonistA had always thought it was just a place where people went to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city 
 But one day , ProtagonistA found out the truth 
 ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was amazed by what ProtagonistA heard , and ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been missing out on something special 
 From then on , ProtagonistA made it a point to visit the sapland every chance ProtagonistA got , and ProtagonistA even started to bring friends and family with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so distraught that ProtagonistA did n't even notice the man standing there with a camera until ProtagonistB was gone 
ProtagonistA rode into the door of the guild hall and pulled her whip out of ProtagonistA's saddlebag 
  ProtagonistA 'm here to join the guild ,  ProtagonistA said 
  What 's ProtagonistA's class ?   ProtagonistA 'm a whip user ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 've been adventuring for years 
  ProtagonistA can fill out this form and we 'll get ProtagonistA started 
  ProtagonistA filled out the form and joined the guild 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the couch in the living room of a house in the middle of nowhere , drinking a glass of water which ProtagonistA hoped would last through the night 
 ProtagonistA was tired , but ProtagonistA could n't sleep 
 ProtagonistA had been on the run for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to feel safe 
 ProtagonistA had found this house a few days ago , and it had seemed like the perfect place to hide 
 But now , in the middle of the night , ProtagonistA was starting to feel like it was a trap 
 ProtagonistA was getting paranoid , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to sleep , but ProtagonistA just could n't 
 ProtagonistA heard a noise outside , and ProtagonistA tensed up 
 ProtagonistA was about to get up to investigate when ProtagonistA heard a voice 
  ProtagonistA relaxed when ProtagonistA recognized the voice of ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB were dead ,  ProtagonistA said 
The first time ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB , when ProtagonistA had been a boy called Spike , ProtagonistA had been playing in the park with ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA had thought that ProtagonistB was really cool , and ProtagonistA had been excited to talk to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA stood in the shadow of ProtagonistB's dusty glass cabinet , ProtagonistA's hooves hanging down on the peg to keep the right eye steady 
 ProtagonistA had been in the same position for hours , waiting for ProtagonistB to come home from work 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would be tired and would n't want to talk , but ProtagonistA had to tell ProtagonistB what had happened 
 ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistC when ProtagonistA went out to look for ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA stood there , not knowing what to do , until ProtagonistB finally got up and hugged ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was on the pedestal of ProtagonistB's bed , drooping down and frowning as ProtagonistA stared up at the stars 
 ProtagonistA was bored out of ProtagonistA's mind , and the only thing that was keeping ProtagonistA from flying away was the hope that ProtagonistB would come back soon 
 ProtagonistA perked up immediately , and flew over to ProtagonistB 
  Where have ProtagonistB been ?  ProtagonistA demanded 
  ProtagonistA was starting to think ProtagonistB forgot about ProtagonistB laughed and ruffled ProtagonistA's mane 
  Yeah , they are ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA guess ProtagonistA should n't have been so worried 
 ProtagonistA 're ProtagonistB's best friend 
When ProtagonistA was twelve years old , ProtagonistA cowered inside a tight , heavy cage 
 ProtagonistA was scared and alone , and ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA had gotten there 
 Now ProtagonistA was in this dark , cold place , and ProtagonistA had no idea what was going to happen to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA heard footsteps approach , and then the cage was opened 
  ProtagonistA 're going to be here for a long time 
 ProtagonistA tried to scream , but no sound would come out 
 ProtagonistA was too terrified to move as ProtagonistB reached in and grabbed ProtagonistA by the arm , dragging ProtagonistA out of the cage 
 ProtagonistA could only sit there and cry , wondering what was going to happen to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA was going to die in this place , and ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistA's family or friends again 
ProtagonistA was standing there in the shade of the window of ProtagonistB's office , watching ProtagonistB's ProtagonistB's house burn down 
 Now , with ProtagonistB's house gone , ProtagonistA would never have to go back there again 
 ProtagonistA could start fresh , and finally be free 
 It was as if the world had been turned upside down and ProtagonistA was the only one left standing 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to feel or what to do 
 ProtagonistA just knew that ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream as ProtagonistA walked through the streets 
 ProtagonistA saw people going about their lives , completely unaware of the tragedy that had just occurred 
 ProtagonistA wanted to scream at them , to tell them that they should be grieving with ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA could n't find the words 
 ProtagonistA eventually made ProtagonistA's way to the park , where ProtagonistA sat down on a bench and just stared at the sky 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB up there , smiling down at ProtagonistA 
 And ProtagonistA would always cherish the memories of ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA had always thought ProtagonistB was a little bit crazy , but this was too much 
  ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head 
  ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't believe in ghosts , but ProtagonistB was clearly terrified 
 ProtagonistA decided to call their parents and tell them what was going on 
 ProtagonistA stood patiently as ProtagonistB used a bucket of water to wash away the dirt and mud from ProtagonistA's hooves 
 ProtagonistA was fast asleep , ProtagonistA's little chest rising and falling with each breath 
ProtagonistA fell for the first time in ProtagonistA's life when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA fell hard for ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA thought that maybe , just maybe , ProtagonistB felt the same way about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA tried everything ProtagonistA could think of to make ProtagonistB see ProtagonistA as more than just a friend , but it was all for nothing 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA had to accept that ProtagonistB would never return ProtagonistA's feelings 
 It was a hard pill to swallow , but ProtagonistA was a stronger man for it 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could find someone who would love ProtagonistA back just as much as ProtagonistA loved them 
ProtagonistA was a simple man 
 ProtagonistA never married and had no children , but ProtagonistA was content 
 ProtagonistA was a good man , and everyone in the village knew it 
 ProtagonistA was shocked , but ProtagonistA could n't refuse 
 ProtagonistA was a good king , and the people loved ProtagonistA 
 But one day , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was getting old 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could n't rule forever , and ProtagonistA wanted to make sure that the people would be taken care of after ProtagonistA was gone 
 So ProtagonistA decreed that , from that day forward , any mare in a free state would have the right to vote and to be elected 
 ProtagonistA wanted to make sure that everyone had a say in their own future 
ProtagonistA dreamed that ProtagonistA was walking through a dense forest 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance 
 ProtagonistA followed the noise until ProtagonistA came to a clearing 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB not to worry , ProtagonistA would help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's way out of the Forest 
 No matter what ProtagonistA wanted to do in life , ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistA could achieve it if ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to it 
 And so , from a young age , ProtagonistA began looking up at the sky and dreaming of all the things ProtagonistA could do 
 As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA continued to look up at the sky , but ProtagonistA also began to notice all the things that were happening on the ground around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA saw the struggles of ProtagonistA's friends and neighbors and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA wanted to help them 
 So , ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's sights on becoming a doctor 
 ProtagonistA studied hard and worked even harder , and eventually ProtagonistA achieved ProtagonistA's goal 
 And , throughout ProtagonistA's career , ProtagonistA never forgot what ProtagonistB had told ProtagonistA : that the sky was the limit 
 It was a dark and stormy night ,  ProtagonistA began ,  and ProtagonistB was out on the streets , looking for a place to sleep 
 ProtagonistA will never forget ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistA will always be grateful to ProtagonistC for ProtagonistC's help 
 ProtagonistA was in the middle of nowhere , and the voice was coming from ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA started to walk towards the voice , and as ProtagonistA got closer ProtagonistA could see that it was a woman 
 ProtagonistA started to run , and as ProtagonistA got closer ProtagonistA could see the fear in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 ProtagonistB was terrified of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was the only one who could help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA reached ProtagonistB's side and ProtagonistB collapsed into ProtagonistA's arms 
 ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistB shaking , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was in shock 
 ProtagonistA sat down with ProtagonistB and held ProtagonistB's close , and ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would never let anything hurt ProtagonistB again 
ProtagonistA felt so tired ProtagonistA could n't even tell the day 
 All ProtagonistA knew was that it was either night or early morning , and ProtagonistA had been walking for what felt like forever 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , ever since ProtagonistA had been kicked out of ProtagonistA's home 
 ProtagonistA had nowhere to go and no one to turn to 
 ProtagonistA was all alone in the world 
 But ProtagonistA kept walking 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving 
 ProtagonistA could n't give up 
 ProtagonistA had to find a way to make it through this 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance 
 ProtagonistA followed the sound until ProtagonistA came to a clearing 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to scare ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA needed help 
 ProtagonistA slowly approached ProtagonistB , and when ProtagonistA was close enough , ProtagonistA spoke in a soft , gentle voice 
 ProtagonistA knew how ProtagonistB felt 
 ProtagonistA had been in ProtagonistB's position before 
 It 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'll help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's way home 
 ProtagonistA may not have known where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's way home 
 ProtagonistA had been a strong man in ProtagonistA's youth , but now ProtagonistA's body was frail and ProtagonistA's mind was failing 
 ProtagonistA was the only family ProtagonistB had left , and ProtagonistB was determined to make ProtagonistA's remaining years as comfortable as possible 
 One day , ProtagonistA passed away peacefully in ProtagonistA's sleep 
ProtagonistA looked around at the other ponies on the grounds and , after a few moments ' thought , decided that ProtagonistA preferred the company of the solid , rather than anything that flopped like the usual soft little things that other ponies had 
 ProtagonistA trotted over to ProtagonistB and nuzzled ProtagonistB's neck 
 From then on , ProtagonistA decided , ProtagonistA would only associate with the ponies who were like ProtagonistA : strong , dependable , and solid 
ProtagonistB was a very weird little pony , very little -- but through no fault of ProtagonistA's own did ProtagonistA ever know it 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the fields near ProtagonistA's house when ProtagonistA came across a ponytail lying in the grass 
 ProtagonistA picked it up and brushed it off , and when ProtagonistA did , the ponytail turned into ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to make of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA decided to take ProtagonistB home and care for ProtagonistB 
 One day , ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong , and ProtagonistB replied ,  ProtagonistB 'm just a little weird , that 's all 
 ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way across the room , never taking ProtagonistA's eyes off of ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA was finally close enough , ProtagonistA struck up a conversation 
 ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was interested in ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would have ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was smooth , and ProtagonistB was putty in ProtagonistA's hands 
 ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB exactly where ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistB 
 Once they were in ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's move 
 ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistB in an instant , and ProtagonistB did n't stand a chance 
ProtagonistA was a loyal dog who always stuck by ProtagonistB's side 
 ProtagonistA barked and hung ProtagonistA's head in worry 
 ProtagonistA paced back and forth in front of the hospital , waiting for ProtagonistB to come out 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to see ProtagonistB and wagged ProtagonistA's tail in excitement 
 ProtagonistA had seen a lot of things in ProtagonistA's career , but this was something different 
 ProtagonistA worked tirelessly , but ProtagonistA just could n't crack the case 
 Then , one day , ProtagonistA got a call from ProtagonistC 
 When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistC shaking and crying 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistC for ProtagonistC's help and then ProtagonistA went to arrest ProtagonistD 
ProtagonistA was having a tough day at work 
 ProtagonistA had been staring at the same stack of paperwork for hours , and ProtagonistA's eyes were starting to hurt 
 ProtagonistA decided to take a break and closed ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA stretched out ProtagonistA's fingers and let ProtagonistA's mind wander 
 ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could just forget about work and go for a ride on ProtagonistB 
So , what 's the plan on the diamond market ? ProtagonistA asked as ProtagonistA gazed out at the street 
 ProtagonistA was happy to finally have found a family that ProtagonistA could call ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA was n't so sure 
 ProtagonistA had never been a big fan of horses , and ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA would like the idea of spending a week in a town full of them 
 ProtagonistA arrived in ProtagonistC on a warm summer day 
 ProtagonistA also noticed the horses 
 ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA enjoying ProtagonistA's time in ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA went on horseback rides , visited the local shops , and even made some new friends 
 By the end of the week , ProtagonistA was sorry to be leaving 
 But ProtagonistA was already planning to come back next year 
ProtagonistA was a horse who loved to run 
 ProtagonistA would gallop across the fields , enjoying the wind in ProtagonistA's mane and the sun on ProtagonistA's back 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was out running , ProtagonistA tripped on a root and fell 
 ProtagonistA hurt ProtagonistA's hoof and could not get up 
 ProtagonistA was grateful to ProtagonistB for helping ProtagonistA 
 From then on , whenever ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would whinny and nicker in thanks 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked at a blank horizon 
 ProtagonistA was a dog , and a good dog at that , but ProtagonistA did n't know what to make of the blank horizon 
 ProtagonistA had been sitting there for hours , ever since ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistA behind 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure why ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB must have had a good reason 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did n't want to leave the blank horizon 
 ProtagonistA was waiting for something , ProtagonistA did n't know what , but ProtagonistA knew that whatever it was , it was coming for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistB's footing at the edge of a ruined stream , and was struggling to ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB downstream , clinging to a tree 
 ProtagonistA shouted to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB could n't hear ProtagonistA over the sound of the water 
 ProtagonistA tried to swim to ProtagonistB , but the current was too strong 
ProtagonistA thundered down the hall of the Palace , ProtagonistA's hooves pounding against the stone walls 
 ProtagonistA was on a mission 
 ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had to save ProtagonistB from the dragon 
 ProtagonistA had to be the hero 
 ProtagonistA turned a corner and saw the dragon , its teeth bared , its eyes glowing red 
 ProtagonistA did n't hesitate 
 ProtagonistA charged 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches , staring up at the stars 
 ProtagonistA wished that ProtagonistA could find someone to share ProtagonistA's life with 
 Someone who would understand ProtagonistA and love ProtagonistA for who ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA continued to stare at the stars , lost in thought 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistB standing there 
 ProtagonistA felt as if ProtagonistA had been struck by lightning 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was the woman ProtagonistA had been waiting for ProtagonistA's whole life 
 ProtagonistA stood up and walked over to ProtagonistB , and they embraced each other 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's wish had come true 
ProtagonistA used to love going into the sunflower garden when ProtagonistA was younger 
 ProtagonistA would duck in every chance ProtagonistA got , even if ProtagonistA was just supposed to be getting the mail 
 ProtagonistA loved the smell of the sunflowers and the way they made ProtagonistA feel happy 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was older , ProtagonistA went back to the sunflower garden 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to see that the sunflowers were all gone 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what had happened and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the sunflowers had been replaced with roses 
 ProtagonistA was sad to see the sunflowers go , but ProtagonistA was happy to see the roses 
ProtagonistA had been waiting all morning for the important piece of paperwork that was going to give ProtagonistB ProtagonistB's retroactive pardon 
 ProtagonistA was a carpenter and ProtagonistA was finishing up a job on a house that was being built 
 ProtagonistA was working on the front porch , putting the finishing touches on it 
 ProtagonistA was putting in a new railing and making sure that it was level 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB both went over to ProtagonistC 
ProtagonistA turned around on ProtagonistA's heels and ran to ProtagonistA's bed , the one ProtagonistA's father had made for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB , to begin the long process of mourning 
 ProtagonistA owed it to ProtagonistA's father , and to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had never been a particularly good father 
 But one morning , when the sun was bright and the mergansie were jovial , ProtagonistA decided to see ProtagonistB for the first time in years 
 ProtagonistA drove to ProtagonistB's apartment in the city , and when ProtagonistB answered the door , ProtagonistB was surprised to see ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was amazed at how much ProtagonistB had grown and changed , and ProtagonistA was filled with pride and love for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was always hungry and ProtagonistA was always getting into trouble 
 When ProtagonistA was ten , ProtagonistA ran away from home 
 ProtagonistA hitchhiked to the nearest city and started living on the streets 
 ProtagonistA did whatever ProtagonistA could to survive 
 ProtagonistA begged for food , ProtagonistA stole , and ProtagonistA did whatever ProtagonistA had to do to stay alive 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was finally starting to make something of ProtagonistA's life 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistD 
 ProtagonistA was finally starting to turn ProtagonistA's life around 
 ProtagonistA was happy and ProtagonistA had a future 
 ProtagonistA was always afraid that ProtagonistA would end up back on the streets 
 ProtagonistA was always afraid that ProtagonistA would end up like ProtagonistC 
 But ProtagonistA was determined to make something of ProtagonistA's life 
 And ProtagonistA did 
ProtagonistA was just finishing up the last of the cupcakes and had nearly finished ProtagonistA's breakfast when ProtagonistA heard the door open 
 ProtagonistA knew it was ProtagonistB coming home from ProtagonistB's night shift at the hospital 
 ProtagonistA got up to greet ProtagonistB with a hug and a kiss 
 ProtagonistA had never remarried , and had instead devoted ProtagonistA to raising ProtagonistB 
 Now that ProtagonistB was married , ProtagonistA felt somewhat lost 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could not continue to live alone , and so ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA would go back to the family home and marry a woman 
The day the earth froze , ProtagonistA used the last of ProtagonistA's magic power to reveal to ProtagonistB the greatest secret of all 
 ProtagonistA 'm sorry ProtagonistA could n't tell ProtagonistB sooner , but ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB 'll be just fine without ProtagonistA 
  With that , ProtagonistA vanished into thin air , leaving ProtagonistB to wonder what had just happened 
  ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB to get it for ProtagonistA 
 The one for the perfect crime ,  ProtagonistA replied 
  ProtagonistA need to get ProtagonistA's hands on it so ProtagonistA can finally get away with murder 
 You have to ,  ProtagonistA insisted 
ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistA's eyes peeled for anything out of the ordinary , but ProtagonistA was doing ProtagonistA best to ignore the odd look the look of interest was giving ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA let ProtagonistA get too caught up in what was going on , ProtagonistA would never be able to focus on ProtagonistA's work 
 ProtagonistA tried to shake it off , but it was no use 
 Finally , ProtagonistA gave up and turned to ProtagonistB 
 Can ProtagonistA help ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked , a little bit of annoyance in ProtagonistA's voice 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart soften a little 
  Oh , ProtagonistA see 
 No matter what life threw at ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA would keep ProtagonistA's eyes peeled for anything out of the ordinary and stay focused on what was important 
ProtagonistA had always been an early riser , so it was no surprise to find ProtagonistA up and about at the crack of dawn 
 ProtagonistA looked around the vast space with the air of a man who had been transported back to England 
 ProtagonistA turned to ProtagonistB and said ,  ProtagonistA 'm looking for a book on etiquette 
 ProtagonistA was so engrossed in the books that ProtagonistA did n't notice when the store started to fill up with customers 
 As the day went on , ProtagonistA became more and more comfortable in the bookstore 
 ProtagonistA started chatting with the customers and helping them find the books they were looking for 
 By the end of the day , ProtagonistA had made quite a few friends 
 ProtagonistA had found what ProtagonistA was looking for , not in a book , but in the people ProtagonistA had met 
ProtagonistA had been married to Applejack for several weeks when ProtagonistA heard that Twilight was expecting ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was overjoyed for ProtagonistA's friends and could n't wait to meet ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistB was born , ProtagonistA was one of the first to visit and held ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's arms , tears of joy streaming down ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to have another little one in the family and could n't wait to watch ProtagonistB grow up 
ProtagonistA was out on a walk with ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA suddenly had the urge to play a prank on ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA laughed to ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB go , before continuing on ProtagonistA's walk 
ProtagonistA was so nervous , ProtagonistA could barely stand still 
 ProtagonistA had never been away from home before , and the big city was so scary 
 And with that , ProtagonistA found the courage to step out into the unknown 
One morning ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's doubts again 
 ProtagonistA was walking to work , and ProtagonistA just could n't shake the feeling that something was off 
 ProtagonistA could n't put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but ProtagonistA just had this feeling like something bad was going to happen 
 ProtagonistA tried to push it out of ProtagonistA's mind , but it was just nagging at ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA okay ? ProtagonistA looked a million miles away 
  ProtagonistA snapped out of it and forced a smile 
  ProtagonistA nodded and went to ProtagonistA's desk 
 ProtagonistA tried to focus on ProtagonistA's work , but ProtagonistA's mind was still racing 
  ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA okay ? ProtagonistA looked a million miles away 
  ProtagonistA snapped out of it and forced a smile 
  ProtagonistA nodded and went to ProtagonistA's desk 
 ProtagonistA tried to focus on ProtagonistA's work , but ProtagonistA's mind was still racing 
ProtagonistA was back at the bank , shuffling ProtagonistA's feet as ProtagonistA waited with bated breath for the check to come in 
 ProtagonistA had been waiting for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had been laid off from ProtagonistA's job 
 The check was ProtagonistA's last hope ; if it did n't come in , ProtagonistA would be homeless 
 ProtagonistA was desperate 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB and begged for a loan , but ProtagonistB refused 
 ProtagonistA had no collateral and no way to prove ProtagonistA could repay the loan 
 ProtagonistA was out of options 
 ProtagonistA went home and packed ProtagonistA's belongings into a suitcase 
 ProtagonistA would have to find a way to make the check stretch until ProtagonistA could find another job 
ProtagonistA looked around , minding ProtagonistA's own business , when ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA face to face with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA dodged to the side at the last second , leaving ProtagonistB to slam into a tree 
 ProtagonistA ran up to ProtagonistB and punched ProtagonistB in the face as hard as ProtagonistA could 
ProtagonistA lifted ProtagonistA's head , and peered out over the horizon 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , and was getting tired 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping to find a town soon , but so far ProtagonistA had seen nothing but desert 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up and sit down for a rest , when ProtagonistA saw something in the distance 
 ProtagonistA started walking towards it , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was a town 
 ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , and soon ProtagonistA was in the town 
 ProtagonistA went to the first building ProtagonistA saw , and knocked on the door 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's bedroom , writing a letter to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was telling ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's day and how ProtagonistA had made a new friend 
 ProtagonistA was really happy and ProtagonistA wanted to share it with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was also telling ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's plans for the future and how ProtagonistA wanted to make a difference in the world 
ProtagonistA had been meaning to write to ProtagonistB for a long time , but ProtagonistA was beginning to get tired of waiting 
 Finally , ProtagonistA decided to take matters into ProtagonistA's own hands and write ProtagonistB a letter 
 In it , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB how ProtagonistA felt about ProtagonistB and how much ProtagonistA cared for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA also told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was getting tired of waiting for ProtagonistB to make a move and that ProtagonistA was going to take action 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB to meet ProtagonistA at the park the following day so that they could talk 
 The next day , ProtagonistA waited at the park for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB never showed up 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's advice and started dating again 
 ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC and they hit it off immediately 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked down at a firm blank horizon 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and ProtagonistA's stomach was empty 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping to find a town or a farm , but so far ProtagonistA had seen nothing but empty fields 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up and lie down to die when ProtagonistA saw a faint light in the distance 
 ProtagonistA got up and started walking towards it , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was a lamp in a window 
 ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , and soon ProtagonistA was at the door of the farmhouse 
 ProtagonistA knocked , and ProtagonistB answered 
 ProtagonistA went to bed that night feeling hopeful for the first time in a long time 
ProtagonistA had been sneaking into the Ponyville library for weeks now 
 ProtagonistA was always careful to do it when the library was crowded , so that no one would notice ProtagonistA 
 I'm sorry , ProtagonistA just really wanted to read this book ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA 're going to have to leave now 
 ProtagonistA hung ProtagonistA's head in shame and walked out of the library 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had been caught this time , but ProtagonistA was determined to find a way to get ProtagonistA's hands on that book 
ProtagonistA hope we 'll be okay 
 ProtagonistA nodded , but said nothing 
 ProtagonistA was tired , and ProtagonistA's hooves hurt 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to find a place to rest , and maybe some food 
 ProtagonistA listened , but ProtagonistA could n't hear anything 
  ProtagonistA do n't hear anything ,  ProtagonistA said 
  There it is again!This time , ProtagonistA could hear it too 
 But ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were faster 
ProtagonistA was a horse whisperer 
 ProtagonistA could communicate with horses better than anyone else 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's life and how ProtagonistA 'd been kicked out of the herd by the alpha male 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about how ProtagonistA 'd been wandering the plains alone for months , searching for a new herd to join 
 ProtagonistA was always the first to wake up in the morning and would spend ProtagonistA's time exploring the grounds or reading in the library 
 Tonight , ProtagonistA had decided to have dinner in ProtagonistA's own house on the fort grounds 
 ProtagonistA sat down at the large , white - walled low table and began to eat ProtagonistA's dinner 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the other room 
 ProtagonistA got up to investigate and found ProtagonistB trying to break into ProtagonistA's house 
 ProtagonistA ran back to the dining room and grabbed a knife from the table 
 ProtagonistA ran back to ProtagonistB and stabbed ProtagonistB in the stomach 
 ProtagonistA finished ProtagonistA's dinner , but ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that something was watching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a peaceful man , and ProtagonistA found solace in the quiet of the forest 
 It was a place that ProtagonistA had always felt connected to , ever since ProtagonistA was a young boy 
 ProtagonistA had many fond memories of exploring the woods with ProtagonistA's friends , and ProtagonistA still loved to take a walk through them whenever ProtagonistA had the chance 
 ProtagonistA could feel a presence in the forest that ProtagonistA had never felt before 
 Slowly , ProtagonistA stood up and began to follow the feeling , not knowing what ProtagonistA would find 
 And there , in the clearing , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to speak to ProtagonistB 
 Slowly , ProtagonistA walked forward , and when ProtagonistA was just a few feet away from ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA cleared ProtagonistA's throat to get ProtagonistB's attention 
 When ProtagonistB turned around , ProtagonistA was shocked to see that ProtagonistB had the most beautiful eyes ProtagonistA had ever seen 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could get lost in them forever 
 And in that moment , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had found the love of ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA was sitting at the kitchen table , working on ProtagonistA's homework 
ProtagonistA was brushing ProtagonistB's hair as the sun rose over the sky 
 ProtagonistA had been up since before dawn , and ProtagonistA was feeling the effects of a long day 
 ProtagonistA had been working on the farm since ProtagonistA was a young boy , and ProtagonistA loved every minute of it 
 ProtagonistA had raised ProtagonistB from a foal , and ProtagonistB was like a member of the family 
 ProtagonistA finished brushing ProtagonistB's coat and gave ProtagonistB a pat on the neck 
  There ProtagonistB go , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA had a lot of work to do today , but ProtagonistA would n't trade it for anything in the world 
ProtagonistA had been a force in the history of the land for many years 
 ProtagonistA had passed away a few years before , but ProtagonistB had not forgotten ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had always been a patient man 
 ProtagonistA would sit for hours waiting for the perfect moment to strike 
 ProtagonistA would just sit there patiently , waiting 
 ProtagonistA had always told ProtagonistB that patience was key when fishing 
 ProtagonistA had always said that the best time to fish was at night , under the light of the moon 
 ProtagonistA came over , and was so proud of ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA gave a hoof and ProtagonistA's ears a slight twitching 
 ProtagonistA had been waiting for this moment for years 
 ProtagonistA was a horse , and ProtagonistA was about to embark on the greatest adventure of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was excited , but ProtagonistA was also a little bit nervous 
 But ProtagonistA was up for the challenge 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have ProtagonistB by ProtagonistA's side , and ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to help ProtagonistB navigate the difficult terrain 
 ProtagonistA was determined to make it to the end of the journey 
 ProtagonistA tried to talk to ProtagonistB about it , but ProtagonistB would just brush ProtagonistA off 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA stopped trying 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would never be the same 
ProtagonistA had been walking through the woods for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting tired 
 ProtagonistA had been following a trail , but it seemed to have disappeared 
 ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA was going in circles 
 ProtagonistA sat down to rest on a log , and ProtagonistA looked up at the moon 
 ProtagonistA was sure the moon was getting bigger and brighter 
 ProtagonistA got up and started to walk again , and ProtagonistA came to a clearing 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was dreaming , but ProtagonistA did n't want to wake up 
ProtagonistA was a Fox - man of the valley , and in those days , the Fox - men were at war with the evil forces of the world 
 ProtagonistA was a brave and noble warrior , and ProtagonistA would do whatever it took to protect ProtagonistA's people 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was out on patrol , ProtagonistA spotted a group of enemy soldiers moving in on ProtagonistA's village 
 ProtagonistA quickly alerted ProtagonistA's fellow Fox - men , and they were able to defend the village and drive the enemy away 
 ProtagonistA was a hero , and ProtagonistA will never be forgotten 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider 
 ProtagonistA tried to make the best of it , though , and rose through the ranks of the great Kingdom of Equestria from its tier - one position , into a far more stable , if very large , position 
 ProtagonistA made many friends along the way , but always felt like ProtagonistA was on the outside looking in 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to confront ProtagonistA's feelings head on 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's parents and asked them why ProtagonistA had been conceived so long after they had met 
 ProtagonistA 're our special little snowflake 
 ProtagonistA was their special little snowflake , and ProtagonistA was proud of it 
 ProtagonistA had been searching through the hospital wing for hours , looking for the right book 
 ProtagonistA had been to the blue drawers a hundred times , but ProtagonistA just could n't find what ProtagonistA was looking for 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up and go to ProtagonistA's office when ProtagonistA heard a voice in the crowd 
 ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistA , over here!It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so relieved to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 've been looking for ProtagonistB everywhere 
 What are ProtagonistA looking for , ProtagonistA book 
 ProtagonistA need to find it before ProtagonistA's appointment 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA had been looking for hours and the book was in ProtagonistA's office the whole time 
 ProtagonistA do n't know what ProtagonistA would have done without ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA turned at the last minute to see ProtagonistB sitting on the bank watching ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 're going to get wet 
   ProtagonistA know ,  ProtagonistA said 
  But ProtagonistA really want to catch a fish 
  And ProtagonistA 're not going to have any bait if ProtagonistA do n't have a worm 
   ProtagonistA know ,  ProtagonistA said 
  But ProtagonistA really want to catch a fish 
  ProtagonistA smiled and went into the water 
 ProtagonistA did n't catch any fish but ProtagonistA had a lot of fun 
ProtagonistA leaned against the tree , ProtagonistA's eyes closed and ProtagonistA's mouth hanging open 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and was now exhausted 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure where ProtagonistA was , or where ProtagonistA was going 
 ProtagonistA just kept walking , until ProtagonistA could n't walk any further 
 ProtagonistA was thirsty , and hungry , but ProtagonistA did n't have the energy to search for food or water 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to rest 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure how long ProtagonistA had been leaning against the tree , but ProtagonistA must have dozed off , because the next thing ProtagonistA knew , someone was shaking ProtagonistA awake 
 ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes to see ProtagonistB standing in front of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA drank the water and ate the food , and then asked ProtagonistB who ProtagonistB was 
 ProtagonistA then asked ProtagonistB where ProtagonistA was , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA was in the forest 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for the food and water , and then asked ProtagonistB to show ProtagonistA the way out of the forest 
 ProtagonistA was very grateful to ProtagonistB , and they became good friends 
ProtagonistA stood there , still wearing ProtagonistA's royal blue dress 
 ProtagonistA loved how ProtagonistA looked in it 
 ProtagonistA felt like a princess 
 ProtagonistA twirled around , the skirt spinning out around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA laughed and then stopped when ProtagonistA saw the look on ProtagonistB's face 
 I do n't care ,  ProtagonistA said , pouting 
 It 's just a dress ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to change , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to 
 ProtagonistA slowly trudged up the stairs , the skirt of ProtagonistA's dress dragging behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA changed into a pair of jeans and a t - shirt and then went back downstairs 
 ProtagonistA did n't look at ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA walked past ProtagonistB and went outside to play 
ProtagonistA was a horse , and a very good horse at that 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's way around the farm better than any other horse , and ProtagonistA was always the one that the other horses went to for advice 
 So when ProtagonistB came to the farm , ProtagonistA was the first to welcome ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB , said ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's hoof hovering over the apple cart 
 One day , ProtagonistA came by the apple cart and ProtagonistB was n't there 
 ProtagonistA looked around for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB was nowhere to be found 
 ProtagonistA eventually found ProtagonistB in the pasture , grazing on some grass 
ProtagonistA sat down on the bench opposite ProtagonistC and looked around 
 ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB and a young couple playing frisbee 
 ProtagonistA smiled and turned to ProtagonistC 
  Is n't it a great day ?  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA was surprised , but shrugged it off and went back to people watching 
 ProtagonistA was determined to make the most of the time they had left together , and so ProtagonistA had decided to take ProtagonistB on a road trip to see all the sights that ProtagonistB had always wanted to see 
 ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to keep ProtagonistB comfortable , but there was only so much ProtagonistA could do 
 ProtagonistA had promised ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would see the trip through to the end 
 So , with a heavy heart , ProtagonistA loaded ProtagonistB's body into the car and continued on their journey 
 ProtagonistA stopped at all the places that ProtagonistB had wanted to see , and ProtagonistA took pictures and made notes so that ProtagonistA could share the experience with others 
 It was a difficult journey , but in the end , it was one that ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA made 
 ProtagonistA looks around the room , taking in the other people seated in a circle around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA can feel the sweat beginning to form on ProtagonistA's forehead and ProtagonistA wipes it away with ProtagonistA's sleeve 
 ProtagonistA takes a deep breath and wills ProtagonistA to calm down 
 ProtagonistA does n't want to lose ProtagonistA's temper , not here , not now 
 ProtagonistA knows that if ProtagonistA does , ProtagonistA 'll only make things worse 
 ProtagonistA has been to these types of meetings before , but this one feels different 
 ProtagonistA ca n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but there is an air of tension in the room that was n't there before 
 ProtagonistA tries to pay attention , but ProtagonistA ca n't focus 
 ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's temper and said some things ProtagonistA regretted 
 ProtagonistA does n't want to make the same mistake again , but ProtagonistA can feel ProtagonistA's anger bubbling up inside of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA takes a few deep breaths and tries to focus on the discussion , but it 's hard 
 ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA needs to leave before ProtagonistA says something ProtagonistA 'll regret , but ProtagonistA does n't want to make a scene 
 ProtagonistA can feel everyone 's eyes on ProtagonistA , and the pressure is too much 
 Finally , ProtagonistA ca n't take it anymore and ProtagonistA explodes 
 ProtagonistA yells at ProtagonistB , telling ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB 's a fraud and that this whole meeting is a waste of time 
 ProtagonistA then storms out of the room , leaving the others behind 
 ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA should n't have lost ProtagonistA's temper like that , but ProtagonistA ca n't help it 
 ProtagonistA 's so angry and frustrated 
 ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA needs to calm down , but ProtagonistA ca n't 
 ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA 's about to explode 
 ProtagonistA goes for a walk , trying to clear ProtagonistA's head , but it does n't help 
 ProtagonistA 's still so angry and ProtagonistA does n't know what to do 
ProtagonistA was having a great day 
 ProtagonistA was out in the park , enjoying the sunshine and the fresh air 
 And ProtagonistA had a bag of delicious cupcakes 
 ProtagonistA was just about to take a bite of one when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB watching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but smile back 
 ProtagonistA was more than happy to share ProtagonistA's cupcakes with ProtagonistB 
 And ProtagonistA could n't stop smiling 
 ProtagonistA was just happy to be spending time with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been in the room for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting tired of the darkness and the silence 
 ProtagonistA was starting to think that maybe ProtagonistA should just take the watch - thing off ProtagonistA's head and leave the room , when ProtagonistA heard a voice 
 ProtagonistA got up and went to the door , and ProtagonistA put ProtagonistA's ear to it 
  Yes , ProtagonistA 'm still here ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'm not sure how much longer ProtagonistA can stay in here 
  ProtagonistA heard the sound of footsteps getting closer , and then the door opened 
  ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB left the room , and they did n't look back 
ProtagonistA was at the dinner party waiting for ProtagonistB , to apologize for not coming sooner 
 ProtagonistA did n't mind , though 
 ProtagonistA was beginning to get quite worn out , though ProtagonistA had n't intended for ProtagonistA's obsession to get out of control 
 ProtagonistA began to follow ProtagonistB around , always begging for just one more 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been taking advantage of ProtagonistB's kindness and that ProtagonistA needed to get help 
 With the help of ProtagonistA's friends , ProtagonistA was able to get ProtagonistA's cupcake obsession under control 
 ProtagonistA apologized to ProtagonistB and they were able to remain friends 
ProtagonistA sat down on the edge of the bank , crossed ProtagonistA's legs , and stared out at the sea beyond the bank 
 ProtagonistA had always loved the ocean , ever since ProtagonistA was a little boy 
 Even now , as an old man , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel the same sense of wonder and awe that ProtagonistA had felt all those years ago 
 ProtagonistA watched as the waves crashed against the shore , the sun glinting off the water 
 ProtagonistA breathed in the salty air and felt the wind blowing through ProtagonistA's hair 
 It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was glad to be alive to see it 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB , standing a few feet away 
 ProtagonistA nodded and got to ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistA took one last look at the ocean , then turned and walked back to ProtagonistA's car with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA expected to find an elderly , dainty man sitting beside ProtagonistA , but instead ProtagonistA found a large , hairy man who was taking up most of the seat 
 ProtagonistA was disgusted and tried to move to the other side of the train , but the man 's body was taking up so much space that ProtagonistA could n't squeeze past 
 ProtagonistA sat there for the rest of the ride , trying not to touch the man or breathe in his stench 
 ProtagonistA quickly got up and rushed off the train , glad to be away from the disgusting man 
ProtagonistA , dressed in the highest style , sat down in the low dining - room of ProtagonistA's house on the bank of the Thames 
 ProtagonistA had just returned from a successful business trip to New York and was in a celebratory mood 
 ProtagonistA ordered the finest wine and the most expensive meal on the menu 
 As ProtagonistA waited for ProtagonistA's food , ProtagonistA looked out the window at the river flowing by 
 ProtagonistA was content and happy 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a loud splash 
 ProtagonistA got up to see what it was and saw ProtagonistB struggling in the water 
 Without thinking , ProtagonistA ran outside and jumped in 
 ProtagonistA was a strong swimmer and quickly reached ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA pulled ProtagonistB to safety and performed CPR until ProtagonistB revived 
 ProtagonistA was a hero 
 ProtagonistA had saved a life 
 But ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA was just glad ProtagonistA was able to help 
ProtagonistA sat down on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked down at the blank gray blue horizon 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and ProtagonistA's stomach was empty 
 ProtagonistA had been following a trail of bread crumbs , but they had long since been eaten by birds 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure where ProtagonistA was or where ProtagonistA was going 
 ProtagonistA only knew that ProtagonistA had to keep moving 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance 
 ProtagonistA got up and started walking towards the sound 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB huddled on the ground 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to scare ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did n't want to leave ProtagonistB alone either 
 Finally , ProtagonistA decided to speak to ProtagonistB 
 Hello there ,  ProtagonistA said softly 
 ProtagonistA knew how ProtagonistB felt 
 ProtagonistA had been in the same situation not too long ago 
 Don't worry ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'll help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's way home 
ProtagonistA was a horse , and ProtagonistA was very proud of the fact that ProtagonistA had once saved the life of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had seen what had happened and had galloped over to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had nudged ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's nose and whinnied loudly , until ProtagonistB had finally regained consciousness 
 Now , ProtagonistA was getting old , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would soon be retired 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have had such a long and eventful life , and ProtagonistA loved spending ProtagonistA's days in the stable , talking to the other horses about all the things ProtagonistA had seen and done 
  ProtagonistA hated it when ProtagonistB rushed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistB would just let ProtagonistA take ProtagonistA's time 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to take ProtagonistB's advice and hurry up 
 ProtagonistA rushed through ProtagonistA's breakfast and ran out the door 
 ProtagonistA did n't even say goodbye to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to get to school and get it over with 
 But when ProtagonistA got to school , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's backpack at home 
 ProtagonistA had to go all the way back home to get it 
 ProtagonistA was so embarrassed 
  Now ProtagonistA 're going to be late for school 
  ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA had just listened to ProtagonistB in the first place 
ProtagonistA was always a good listener 
 ProtagonistA never interrupted when ProtagonistB was talking , and ProtagonistA always had a kind word to say 
 It 's all right , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said comfortingly 
  ProtagonistA 'm always here for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been out of work for weeks and was down to ProtagonistA's last few dollars 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping to find a job today , but so far , no luck 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up and go home when ProtagonistA heard the call 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't ignore it 
 ProtagonistA had to help 
 ProtagonistA scrambled down the bank and ran towards the sound 
 ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB in the water , struggling to stay afloat 
 ProtagonistA did n't hesitate 
 ProtagonistA jumped in and pulled ProtagonistB to safety 
 ProtagonistA had just saved a life 
ProtagonistA had taken to riding into ProtagonistA's house on ProtagonistA's pink saddle hoof , noting the rows of fifth - story windows that led from ProtagonistA's backyard down into the city 
 One day , as ProtagonistA was trotting along , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling to ProtagonistA from one of the windows 
 ProtagonistA steered his hoof over to ProtagonistB's window and stopped 
 Hello , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
 Of course ,  ProtagonistA said 
 Of course ProtagonistA 'll help ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
 A few days later , ProtagonistA was back at ProtagonistB's window , helping ProtagonistB to carry ProtagonistB's things down to the street 
 ProtagonistA was happy to help ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would appreciate it 
 It was no problem ,  ProtagonistA said 
 And with that , ProtagonistA trotted off , back to ProtagonistA's house , feeling good about ProtagonistA and the good deed ProtagonistA had done 
 ProtagonistA was always friendly and would always go out of ProtagonistA's way to help the customers 
 One day , ProtagonistA was helping ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA stepped carefully down the steps of ProtagonistA's trailer , ProtagonistA's eyes resting on the blackened metal 
 It had been a long time since ProtagonistA 'd been out here , and everything looked different 
 Now , ProtagonistA was alone 
 ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way to the edge of the property , where the metal fence was 
 ProtagonistA leaned against it , looking out at the view 
 ProtagonistA could see the city in the distance , and it looked so different from up here 
 ProtagonistA sighed , wondering what ProtagonistA was doing here 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't go back to the city 
 ProtagonistA did n't have anything there anymore 
 But ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do out here , either 
 ProtagonistA supposed ProtagonistA would just have to take it one day at a time 
ProtagonistA stood in the dim light of the distance , ProtagonistA's face downcast and blue eyes fixed on the ground below 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and blistered 
 ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was or where ProtagonistA was going 
 ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's home in the city days ago , after a huge argument with ProtagonistA's parents 
 ProtagonistA had been wandering aimlessly ever since 
 ProtagonistA was tired and hungry , and ProtagonistA's stomach was growling 
 ProtagonistA had no money and no food 
 ProtagonistA had been sleeping in parks and on benches , and ProtagonistA was dirty and disheveled 
 ProtagonistA had thought about going back home , but ProtagonistA was too proud and stubborn 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to admit that ProtagonistA had made a mistake 
 ProtagonistA continued to walk , not knowing where to go or what to do 
 ProtagonistA felt lost and alone 
 As the sun began to set , ProtagonistA saw a sign for a small town up ahead 
 ProtagonistA decided to go there and see if ProtagonistA could find a place to stay for the night 
 As ProtagonistA entered the town , ProtagonistA was surprised to see that it was very quaint and charming 
 ProtagonistA walked down the main street , looking for a place to stay 
 ProtagonistA saw a sign for a bed and breakfast , and ProtagonistA decided to go there 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door , and ProtagonistB answered 
 ProtagonistA explained ProtagonistA's situation , and ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA in 
 ProtagonistA was so grateful 
 The next morning , ProtagonistA woke up refreshed and ready to start a new day 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's kindness , and ProtagonistA set off down the road , feeling hopeful for the first time in days 
ProtagonistA stood before ProtagonistA's desk , looking at the empty chair across from ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had changed 
 ProtagonistA was no longer the same person ProtagonistA had been when they first met 
 ProtagonistA had been through too much , and seen too much 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would never understand what ProtagonistA had become 
 ProtagonistA did n't need anyone 's understanding 
 All ProtagonistA needed was to be left alone 
 ProtagonistA turned away from the empty chair and sat down at ProtagonistA's desk 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA was not interested in anything ProtagonistB had to offer , and ProtagonistB was not about to force ProtagonistB on someone who did n't want ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA , sat at ProtagonistB's desk , ProtagonistA's hooves resting on the very smooth surface of the paper 
 ProtagonistA had been a gift to ProtagonistB from ProtagonistB's daughter , and ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA dearly 
 ProtagonistA was always so well - behaved , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB just as much 
 Why do n't ProtagonistA go and play with ProtagonistA's toys for a little while?Amber seemed to understand , and ProtagonistA trotted off to the other room 
ProtagonistA stood in the doorway of the bank , and the crystal ball was spinning in ProtagonistA's fingers 
 ProtagonistA had been planning this heist for months , and everything was finally falling into place 
 ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB pacing back and forth in the lobby , and the tellers busy at their stations 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to act fast 
 ProtagonistA walked into the bank and approached ProtagonistB 
 Pretending to trip , ProtagonistA dropped the crystal ball 
 As ProtagonistB bent down to help ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA grabbed ProtagonistA's gun and pointed it at ProtagonistB 
  This is a robbery ,  ProtagonistA yelled 
 ProtagonistA could hear the sirens in the distance , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA had gotten away with the perfect crime 
ProtagonistA cracked open ProtagonistA's newspaper , nudged the option beneath the headline Today , ProtagonistA was going to write a story about ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA sat up on the front step of the house with ProtagonistA's eyes closed 
 ProtagonistA had been sitting there for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had arrived home from work 
 ProtagonistA was too tired to go inside , too tired to even move 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to sit there and relax , and maybe doze off for a little while 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw ProtagonistB approaching 
 As ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was a woman 
 ProtagonistA just moved here ProtagonistA 
  Yes?You can stay here ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA have a spare bedroom , and ProtagonistB 're welcome to use it 
  Thank ProtagonistA so much ! ProtagonistA 're a lifesaver 
 ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's feet and led ProtagonistB into the house 
 ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB to the spare bedroom , and ProtagonistB gratefully accepted ProtagonistA's offer 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what had come over ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had been able to help ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had been through so much , so many times , that ProtagonistA 'd reached the point where ProtagonistA 'd stopped caring what happened to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 'd been through heartbreak , loss , and betrayal , and ProtagonistA was tired of it all 
 ProtagonistA was tired of feeling like ProtagonistA was the only one who cared about anything 
 So , when ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistA did n't even shed a tear 
 ProtagonistA just shrugged it off and went on with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistB again 
 And when ProtagonistC left ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA did n't even try to stop ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA just let ProtagonistC go and went on with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistC was gone 
 ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistC again 
 ProtagonistA had reached the point where nothing mattered to ProtagonistA anymore 
 ProtagonistA was just going through the motions of life , without any real purpose or meaning 
 ProtagonistA was just existing , not living 
 And ProtagonistA was okay with that 
ProtagonistA stepped out of the greenhouse , whirled , and threw ProtagonistA's head back 
 ProtagonistA had forgotten ProtagonistA's coat inside and now ProtagonistA regretted it 
 ProtagonistA turned back to the greenhouse to go get it when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB in the distance 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA had a feeling ProtagonistA was going to find out 
I remember ProtagonistA ; and I remember , too , that ProtagonistA was born a little after the year 1852 , that ProtagonistA was of the small family , of the same kind as myself , though no one of that family should have been more than ten years my senior ; and that ProtagonistB , had no money , which only bordered on the imaginary , while ProtagonistB had everything else desired , and that everything ProtagonistB asked for was granted ProtagonistB without any regard to the wants of others 
 I never had anything that ProtagonistA wanted , and ProtagonistA always had everything that I wanted ; but that never made any difference between us 
ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's wings for more than a year when ProtagonistA discovered what ProtagonistB , had been planning for a good long while 
 ProtagonistA was horrified and went to ProtagonistC to warn ProtagonistC 
ProtagonistA peered into ProtagonistA's book , half - listening , half - expecting ProtagonistB to speak 
 ProtagonistA had been sitting in the same spot for hours , lost in the world of ProtagonistA's book 
  ProtagonistA 've read that series like , five times 
 ProtagonistA know ,  ProtagonistA said 
  But ProtagonistA ca n't help it 
 ProtagonistA love it 
 They're more than that ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA sat down and just watched as ProtagonistB squatted beside ProtagonistA and watched ProtagonistA draw ProtagonistA's bow and day out 
 ProtagonistA had always been the better hunter , but ProtagonistB had never given up trying to beat ProtagonistA 
 I do n't doubt it ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA 'm going to have enough meat to last ProtagonistA the winter 
 Thanks for watching ,  ProtagonistA replied 
ProtagonistA sat at ProtagonistA's desk and watched as ProtagonistB leaned ProtagonistB's head onto ProtagonistA's shoulder 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistB's body relax as ProtagonistB took a deep breath and closed ProtagonistB's eyes 
 ProtagonistA thought about all of the things they had been through together 
 ProtagonistA remembered the time when they were both younger and ProtagonistB had gotten lost in the city 
 ProtagonistA had been so worried about ProtagonistB but ProtagonistB had always had a knack for finding ProtagonistB's way home 
 ProtagonistA also remembered the time when ProtagonistB had broken ProtagonistB's leg and ProtagonistA had to carry ProtagonistB's home 
 ProtagonistA felt grateful to have ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA wrapped ProtagonistA's arms around ProtagonistB and held ProtagonistB close 
ProtagonistA was walking home from school when ProtagonistA saw a man walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die 
 ProtagonistA tried to run , but the man was too fast 
 ProtagonistA felt the knife enter ProtagonistA's back and ProtagonistA fell to the ground 
ProtagonistA was lying on the floor of ProtagonistA's room , bending forward 
 ProtagonistA was trying to reach the remote that had fallen just out of ProtagonistA's reach 
 ProtagonistA could see it , just barely , but it might as well have been a mile away 
 ProtagonistA was just about to give up when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB coming down the hall 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was in for it if ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA like this 
 ProtagonistA had to think fast 
ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistA's hoof out of ProtagonistB's eyes , but fished out a few strands of pony hair , like ProtagonistA always had 
 ProtagonistA was getting too old for this , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit nostalgic 
 ProtagonistA remembered the first time ProtagonistA had held ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's hooves 
 ProtagonistA was afraid ProtagonistA would break ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB was perfect 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to let ProtagonistB go , but it was hard 
 ProtagonistA was going to miss ProtagonistB so much 
 ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB one last hug and then turned to leave 
 As ProtagonistA walked away , ProtagonistA felt a tear run down ProtagonistA's cheek 
ProtagonistA was a horse who lived on a farm 
 ProtagonistA said yes , but ProtagonistA should have said no 
 ProtagonistA was not strong enough to pull the wagon and ProtagonistA ended up getting stuck 
 ProtagonistA was embarrassed and ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA had said no to the job 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day 
 First , ProtagonistA woke up late and had to rush to get ready for ProtagonistA's day 
 Then , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had forgotten to put on ProtagonistA's shoes and had to go back to ProtagonistA's room to find them 
 When ProtagonistA finally made it downstairs , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's keys upstairs 
 So , ProtagonistA had to go back up to get them 
 By the time ProtagonistA made it out the door , ProtagonistA was already running late 
 ProtagonistA rushed to ProtagonistA's car , but when ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had locked ProtagonistA's keys in the house 
 ProtagonistA did n't have time to go back , so ProtagonistA had to call ProtagonistB 
 By the time ProtagonistB arrived , ProtagonistA was so frazzled , ProtagonistA forgot to pay ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA finally made it to work , but ProtagonistA's boss was not happy 
 ProtagonistA sat at ProtagonistA's desk , trying to concentrate on ProtagonistA's work , but ProtagonistA was so distracted , ProtagonistA could n't focus 
 ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA okay?Bob turned to see ProtagonistA's co - worker , Concerned 
  ProtagonistA 'm fine ,  ProtagonistA lied 
 ProtagonistA do n't look fine 
 ProtagonistA look like ProtagonistA 're about to have a breakdown 
 But ProtagonistA was n't fine 
 ProtagonistA was about to lose ProtagonistA's job , ProtagonistA had no money to pay ProtagonistA's rent , and ProtagonistA was pretty sure ProtagonistA's girlfriend was about to break up with ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA sat there , staring at ProtagonistA's computer screen , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's keys at home again 
 ProtagonistA was having the worst day ever 
ProtagonistA had been having a great day 
 ProtagonistA had just finished up at work and was looking forward to a relaxing evening at home 
 But when ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's front door , ProtagonistA froze 
 ProtagonistA was about to turn and run when ProtagonistB spoke 
  ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to go with ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was afraid of what would happen if ProtagonistA did n't 
 So ProtagonistA reluctantly followed ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA was led away 
ProtagonistA stood and watched ProtagonistA's sister Dash ProtagonistB float by 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could join ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to stay on the bank and watch ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been bugging ProtagonistB for weeks to come over and hang out , and ProtagonistB had been putting it off 
 But ProtagonistA was insistent , and ProtagonistB finally relented 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately , and ProtagonistB had been meaning to reach out to ProtagonistA but just had n't gotten around to it 
 When ProtagonistB got there , ProtagonistA was thrilled to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistB was persistent 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA relented and agreed to come over to ProtagonistB's house 
ProtagonistA was standing there , wondering how to explain ProtagonistA's pregnancy without sounding like an idiot 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be home soon , and ProtagonistA did n't want to have to explain why ProtagonistA was pregnant 
 ProtagonistA had been trying to keep it a secret from ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would eventually find out 
 ProtagonistA was just hoping that ProtagonistB would be understanding 
 When ProtagonistB walked in , ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was not happy 
 ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA had been wondering how to explain ProtagonistA's pregnancy without sounding like an idiot , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to tell ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was sorry for not being honest with ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was scared of ProtagonistB's reaction 
ProtagonistA had ruptured ProtagonistA's ACL playing football with ProtagonistA's friends and was now facing a long road to recovery 
 ProtagonistA was lucky that ProtagonistB was there to help ProtagonistA through it 
 Now , ProtagonistA was facing another challenge , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be there for ProtagonistA every step of the way 
Now , said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA sat down in ProtagonistA's chair , ProtagonistA want to tell you a story 
ProtagonistA sat in the back seat of ProtagonistA's pink and white pony wagon and watched the clouds drift away 
 ProtagonistA loved the way they looked like fluffy cotton candy 
 ProtagonistA was content to just sit back and enjoy the ride 
 ProtagonistA loved spending time with ProtagonistA's family and being outdoors 
ProtagonistA had been walking through the desert for days , ProtagonistA's water supply running low 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up hope when ProtagonistA saw a small oasis in the distance 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting in the shade of a palm tree 
ProtagonistA stood with ProtagonistA's hooves on the other side of the barrier , watching the ponies through the small crack in the glass 
 ProtagonistA had tried to shrink ProtagonistA down , but it never worked 
 One day , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA would stand on the other side of the barrier and watch ProtagonistB's play with the other ponies 
 ProtagonistA asked the other ponies what had happened to ProtagonistB , but they would n't tell ProtagonistA 
 A few weeks later , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistA had been listening to ProtagonistB's story for hours , and ProtagonistA still had so many questions 
 But ProtagonistA could n't bear to end ProtagonistB's story without telling ProtagonistB of the man who had saved ProtagonistB's life and placed ProtagonistB in the care of ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was well known in the world for ProtagonistA's literary talent and for ProtagonistA's indomitable resolution 
ProtagonistA rested ProtagonistA's forelegs on ProtagonistA's elbows and let out a deep breath 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let ProtagonistA's mind wander 
 ProtagonistA thought about all the things ProtagonistA had to do tomorrow and sighed 
 ProtagonistA was so tired and just wanted to sleep 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw ProtagonistB standing in the shadows 
 ProtagonistA felt bad for ProtagonistB and wanted to help 
 ProtagonistA stood up and walked over to ProtagonistB 
  Are ProtagonistB okay ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say , but ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA needed to say something 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA nodded and said ,  If ProtagonistB need anything , just let ProtagonistA know 
  Then ProtagonistA turned and walked away 
ProtagonistA looked rather like a bimbos older or younger than ProtagonistA had been when ProtagonistA first met ProtagonistB for the first time , considering the circumstances 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot since then , and it showed in the lines on ProtagonistA's face and the gray in ProtagonistA's hair 
ProtagonistA had been travelling west , but ProtagonistA's eyes had been paid to the south , where the sun shone and the air was still and fragrant , the colour of wheat or millet 
 ProtagonistA had been on the road for weeks , and ProtagonistA's supplies were running low 
 ProtagonistA was getting desperate 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a small farmhouse in the middle of nowhere 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door , but there was no answer 
 ProtagonistA peered in the window and saw ProtagonistB inside , sitting in a rocking chair 
 ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB did n't respond 
 ProtagonistA tried the door , but it was locked 
 ProtagonistA knocked again , harder this time 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB had any food , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB did n't have much , but ProtagonistB could give ProtagonistA some of ProtagonistB's husband 's old clothes 
 ProtagonistA was grateful for the clothes and ProtagonistB's kindness 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB needed anything , but ProtagonistB just shook ProtagonistB's head and told ProtagonistA to be on ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA continued on ProtagonistA's journey , but ProtagonistA could n't get ProtagonistB out of ProtagonistA's mind 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could have done more for ProtagonistB 
 A few days later , ProtagonistA came across a group of travellers 
 As they travelled , ProtagonistA told them about ProtagonistB and how ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could have helped ProtagonistB more 
 ProtagonistA just nodded ProtagonistA's head in response , not really sure what to say 
 And yet , here ProtagonistA was , about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to travel the world , and now ProtagonistA finally had the chance 
 ProtagonistA was going to be a part of a travelling circus , and ProtagonistA could not be more excited 
 And now , here ProtagonistA was , about to make them come true 
 ProtagonistA hugged ProtagonistB tightly , promising to come back and visit ProtagonistB as often as ProtagonistA could 
 Then , with a final wave , ProtagonistA was off , ready to start the adventure of a lifetime 
 Finally , ProtagonistA gave up and walked over to ProtagonistB , nuzzling ProtagonistA's nose in ProtagonistB's direction 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the rocking chair , ProtagonistB's hooves beneath ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA looked out at the sunset , thinking about all the things that had happened in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA 'd been through a lot , but ProtagonistA was still here , still fighting 
 ProtagonistA was grateful for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that as long as ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA could make it through anything 
ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's wings for four years when ProtagonistA discovered that ProtagonistA was pregnant 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how it had happened , but ProtagonistA was sure that it was a mistake 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to be a father , not yet 
 ProtagonistA was still too young and too irresponsible 
 ProtagonistA considered getting an abortion , but ProtagonistA could n't bring ProtagonistA to do it 
 ProtagonistA knew that it would be the right thing to do , but ProtagonistA just could n't bring ProtagonistA to do it 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to kill ProtagonistB 
 Instead , ProtagonistA decided to keep ProtagonistB and raise ProtagonistB on ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA knew it would be hard , but ProtagonistA was determined to do it 
 ProtagonistA would make it work , somehow 
 ProtagonistA had been worried about being a father , but it turned out that ProtagonistA was a natural 
 ProtagonistA was patient and kind , and ProtagonistA always knew just what to do 
 ProtagonistA was everything that ProtagonistB needed , and ProtagonistB thrived under ProtagonistA's care 
 ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA had made the decision to keep ProtagonistB 
When ProtagonistA had reached the age of six years old , ProtagonistA began to change into the great doll , who ProtagonistA was always about 
 ProtagonistA would sit for hours in front of the mirror , combing ProtagonistA's hair and straightening ProtagonistA's clothes 
 But ProtagonistA would just smile and continue talking to the doll 
 ProtagonistA was talking to them in a soft voice , as if ProtagonistA was telling them a secret 
 When ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was doing , ProtagonistA just smiled and said ,  ProtagonistA 'm becoming the great doll 
  And from that day on , ProtagonistA was never the same again 
ProtagonistA was a simple farm horse who loved nothing more than a good roll in the mud and a carrot or two 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life until one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 From the moment ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was in trouble 
 ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistA's heart racing as ProtagonistA looked into ProtagonistB's eyes 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was in for the ride of ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the field of our estate , looking at a photograph of ProtagonistB , with the utmost circumstance of safety 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about how much had changed since ProtagonistB had passed away 
 Now , ProtagonistA was all alone 
 ProtagonistA sighed and put the photograph away , getting to ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistA dusted off ProtagonistA's trousers and decided to go for a walk 
 As ProtagonistA wandered through the estate , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a pang of sadness at all the memories that were now hidden away in the past 
 ProtagonistA would just have to find ProtagonistA's own way to relax 
 When they died , ProtagonistA was the only one left 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to sell the house , but ProtagonistA could n't keep it up by ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA would come by every now and then to check on it , but it was just too much for ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA got a call from ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was surprised , but happy 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping to sell it for years 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB to go ahead and finalize the sale 
 The next day , ProtagonistA went to the house to sign the papers 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to see that the new owners were a young couple with a child 
 ProtagonistA was happy to see that the house was going to a good family 
 ProtagonistA said goodbye and went on ProtagonistA's way 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was the only unicorn 
 ProtagonistA had never seen another one like ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA was the only one in the world 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to finally meet another unicorn 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner 
 ProtagonistA never really felt like ProtagonistA fit in anywhere 
 ProtagonistA should have known something was wrong when ProtagonistB started making strange comments about wanting to kill people 
 But ProtagonistA did n't want to believe that ProtagonistB could be so dark and twisted 
 Sadly , ProtagonistA was wrong 
 ProtagonistA was only able to survive by pure luck , and ProtagonistA was left with some serious injuries 
 ProtagonistA was finally able to see ProtagonistB for the monster that ProtagonistB was 
ProtagonistA had been taking the ferry down to the harbor every day for years 
 ProtagonistA knew every twist and turn of the winding stone steps 
 As ProtagonistA took the ferry down the steps , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB lying at the bottom 
  ProtagonistA ca n't leave ProtagonistB here 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anyone like ProtagonistB before 
 ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA should help ProtagonistB or not 
 Finally , ProtagonistA made up ProtagonistA's mind 
 ProtagonistA would help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA went down to ProtagonistB and tried to lift ProtagonistB up , but ProtagonistB was too heavy 
 ProtagonistA could n't do it by ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA shouted for help , but no one came 
 Finally , ProtagonistA saw a group of men coming down the steps 
 ProtagonistA think ProtagonistB 's hurt ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA never saw ProtagonistB again , but ProtagonistA always wondered what happened to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had seen a lot of death in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA 'd been a soldier for years , and ProtagonistA 'd seen ProtagonistA's friends die in battle 
 And the worst part was , ProtagonistA was powerless to stop it 
 ProtagonistA watched , frozen in horror , as the man was killed 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA felt sick to ProtagonistA's stomach , and ProtagonistA wanted to vomit 
 But ProtagonistA forced ProtagonistA to stay calm 
 ProtagonistA had to think 
ProtagonistA had been married for years , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly 
 However , lately ProtagonistA had been feeling restless 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to travel and see the world , and now that ProtagonistB was getting older , ProtagonistA felt like it was finally time to do something for ProtagonistA 
 So , one day , ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and left ProtagonistB alone in the garden 
 ProtagonistA went to pick up the newspaper and dipped it into ProtagonistA's cupboard , wishing ProtagonistA had a camera and a memory of where ProtagonistA had put it the week before 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would be heartbroken when ProtagonistA left , but ProtagonistA did n't want to burden ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's wanderlust 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would be better off without ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA drove away from ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA felt a mixture of sadness and excitement 
 ProtagonistA was sad to be leaving ProtagonistB behind , but ProtagonistA was also excited to finally be embarking on ProtagonistA's own adventure 
 Who knows what the future holds ? ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA drove into the sunset 
ProtagonistA usually sat at ProtagonistA's desk and wrote in a notebook 
 ProtagonistA was a writer , and ProtagonistA found that writing in a notebook was the best way for ProtagonistA to get ProtagonistA's ideas down 
 Today , however , ProtagonistA was having trouble focusing 
 ProtagonistA kept thinking about the fight ProtagonistA had with ProtagonistB the night before 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to apologize to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was n't sure how to go about it 
  ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said ,  ProtagonistC need to talk to ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA turned to ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistC could see the sadness in ProtagonistA's eyes 
ProtagonistA was a unicorn , and ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's best friend 
 But one day , ProtagonistA betrayed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA said something mean to ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB felt ProtagonistB's heart break 
 ProtagonistA was just a figment of ProtagonistB's imagination 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it 
 ProtagonistA knew in that moment that ProtagonistA was going to dance with ProtagonistB 
 Slowly , ProtagonistA stood up and made ProtagonistA's way across the room 
 ProtagonistA could feel the eyes of the other guests on ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA had never felt so alive 
 ProtagonistA had never felt this way before 
 ProtagonistA could barely find the words to respond 
  It was ProtagonistA's pleasure ,  ProtagonistA managed to say 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget this night 
In the days when ProtagonistA tried to forget or suppress all sense of history , ProtagonistA made a point of discussing ProtagonistA's own ministry with ProtagonistA's fellow church members and those whom ProtagonistA met through the temple 
 ProtagonistA was always careful to keep ProtagonistA's stories about ProtagonistA's ministry separate from ProtagonistA's stories about ProtagonistA's personal life 
 This way , ProtagonistA could forget about ProtagonistA's past and focus on the present 
 ProtagonistA hesitated at first , but then ProtagonistA began to open up 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the people ProtagonistA had met and the places ProtagonistA had been 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the good times and the bad times 
 As ProtagonistA spoke , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been suppressing ProtagonistA's memories for too long 
 ProtagonistA had been trying to forget about ProtagonistA's past , but it was time to face it 
ProtagonistA , in my modest opinion , was walking home in ProtagonistA's own shoes , with ProtagonistA's hat on , from the back of the church , where ProtagonistA had been having the rough passage due to he , and which was 
 ProtagonistA was a bit down in the dumps , but ProtagonistA tried to keep ProtagonistA's chin up 
 ProtagonistA was looking forward to getting home , taking ProtagonistA's shoes off , and putting ProtagonistA's feet up 
 When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA was surprised to see ProtagonistB waiting for ProtagonistA at the door 
 ProtagonistA knew that something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had failed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA broke down in tears and hugged ProtagonistB tightly 
 ProtagonistA had been with ProtagonistB in the hospital the night before ProtagonistB passed away , holding ProtagonistB's hand and telling ProtagonistB how much ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB 
 The next morning , ProtagonistA woke up from a dream in which ProtagonistB was still alive and healthy 
 ProtagonistA was so overwhelmed with happiness and relief that ProtagonistA started to cry 
 All will be well , ProtagonistA thought 
 ProtagonistA am free , though ProtagonistA doubt it 
 Oh , ProtagonistA know it 's a bad idea 
 ProtagonistA was at a party once 
 ProtagonistA remembered how out of place ProtagonistA felt , surrounded by the wealthy elite 
 ProtagonistA had been sipping on a glass of wine , when ProtagonistA overheard two men talking 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to get involved , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do something 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB and told ProtagonistB what ProtagonistA had overheard 
 ProtagonistA thought that was the end of it , but ProtagonistA was wrong 
 ProtagonistA knew then that ProtagonistA had to leave the city 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's friend and said goodbye 
 ProtagonistA promised to keep in touch , but ProtagonistA never did 
 ProtagonistA knew it was for the best 
 ProtagonistA had to start a new life , somewhere far away from the danger 
 ProtagonistA , is also having a difficult time 
 ProtagonistA is trying to help ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA is also trying to keep up with ProtagonistA's own studies 
ProtagonistA had always been good at cards 
 ProtagonistA could remember back to when ProtagonistA was just a boy , sitting around the kitchen table with ProtagonistA's brothers and sisters , playing for pennies 
 ProtagonistA had always had a knack for reading people and knowing what cards they were holding 
 As ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA started to play for higher stakes 
 ProtagonistA began to travel from town to town , pitting ProtagonistA's skills against anyone who was willing to play ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA quickly gained a reputation as the best card player around 
 One day , ProtagonistA heard about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA set out on ProtagonistA's journey , and after a long and arduous journey , ProtagonistA finally arrived at ProtagonistB's doorstep 
 ProtagonistA had become the world 's best card player , and ProtagonistA had stolen the title from ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had been hunting for days , ever since the villagers had snatched ProtagonistB from ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had tracked them to this valley , and now ProtagonistA had found the body of ProtagonistB , lying among the trees and wildflowers 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never be able to bring ProtagonistB back to life , but ProtagonistA could at least give ProtagonistB a proper burial 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an oddball , and ProtagonistA's eighteenth year was no different 
 ProtagonistA had just finished high school and was eager to start ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was convinced that ProtagonistB was the one for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was determined to make ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's wife 
 ProtagonistA was in for a surprise 
 ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA had made a mistake , but ProtagonistA was not sure how to get out of it 
 ProtagonistA tried to make the best of it , but the honeymoon was a disaster 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had made a mistake , but ProtagonistA was not ready to give up on ProtagonistA's dream of finding the perfect wife 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's third year of college and things were going great 
 ProtagonistA was doing well in ProtagonistA's classes and had a lot of friends 
 ProtagonistA was even dating ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life and did n't see any reason to change anything 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to go to classes or see ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to be alone 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA started to pull ProtagonistA out of ProtagonistA's slump 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistB was n't worth ProtagonistA's time and that ProtagonistA was better off without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA started hanging out with ProtagonistA's friends again and doing better in ProtagonistA's classes 
 ProtagonistA was finally happy again 
 Looking back , ProtagonistA realized that the break - up was the best thing that could have ever happened to ProtagonistA 
In the year of our Lord 2001 , ProtagonistA was sitting in the chair , with ProtagonistA's hat on the mantelpiece , and ProtagonistB next to ProtagonistA , which was a very strange arrangement 
 ProtagonistA was a large man , with a hearty laugh and a jovial disposition 
 ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB , a little taken aback 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say or how to respond 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to kill ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could see the pain and suffering ProtagonistB was in 
 Finally , ProtagonistA nodded 
 Okay , ProtagonistA 'll do it 
 ProtagonistA got up and went to the mantelpiece , where ProtagonistA took down ProtagonistA's hat 
 ProtagonistA walked back to ProtagonistB and put the hat on ProtagonistB's head 
  ProtagonistA 've really done it 
  ProtagonistA had always been the successful one , the one who had made something of ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 've made something of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 're successful 
  ProtagonistA put ProtagonistA's hand on ProtagonistB's shoulder and gave ProtagonistB a reassuring squeeze 
  ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB are ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA know 
One minute , ProtagonistA was standing in front of ProtagonistA's desk , examining the file ProtagonistA had been given 
 The next minute , ProtagonistA was on the floor , unconscious 
ProtagonistA had always been a hard worker 
 ProtagonistA started out working in ProtagonistA's father 's horse and carriage business when ProtagonistA was just a boy 
 When ProtagonistA was old enough , ProtagonistA bought ProtagonistA's own horse and carriage and started out on ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA did n't have the money to compete with the other carriage businesses in the city , so ProtagonistA started doing odd jobs for people 
 ProtagonistA would do anything they asked , no matter how dirty or difficult it was 
 ProtagonistA quickly gained a reputation as a reliable and honest worker , and people started recommending ProtagonistA to their friends 
 Before long , ProtagonistA had more work than ProtagonistA could handle 
 ProtagonistA was able to save up enough money to buy a small house in the city , and ProtagonistA started to furnish it with the things ProtagonistA needed 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life and did n't need anything more 
 ProtagonistA was happy just doing ProtagonistA's work and being able to provide for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did as ProtagonistA was told and waited outside the building 
 ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistC into the building and down a long hallway 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a large room with a table in the center 
 ProtagonistA did as ProtagonistA was told and was soon finished 
 ProtagonistA was amazed at how much money ProtagonistA had just counted 
 ProtagonistA had never seen so much money in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was now a rich man , and ProtagonistA knew it would n't be long before ProtagonistA was able to buy ProtagonistA's own horse and carriage business 
ProtagonistA had been working at ProtagonistA's job for years , and ProtagonistA had never once been summoned to ProtagonistB's office 
 ProtagonistA always just went in when it was time for ProtagonistA's shift 
 But today , as ProtagonistA stood at ProtagonistA's office door , waiting to be summoned , ProtagonistA noticed that the door was open 
 ProtagonistA slowly pushed it open and peeked inside 
  ProtagonistA sat down , and ProtagonistB continued 
  But why ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA would find another job , and ProtagonistA would never give up 
ProtagonistA had the gall to tell us that ProtagonistA had made an incursion into the kingdom of Henry the Second , and that ProtagonistA had been interested , though ProtagonistA had not been interested in the slightest degree 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had been in ProtagonistB's court , and that ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB 
 When we asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistB was like , ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistB was a tall man , with a long beard , and that ProtagonistB wore a crown 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistC , too , and that ProtagonistC was a beautiful woman 
 When we asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistC was like , ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistC was tall , with long hair , and that ProtagonistC wore a crown , too 
ProtagonistA had been living in the city for a long time , and ProtagonistA knew that the term  send a runner  was more than a little strange to the people who lived there 
 Nevertheless , ProtagonistA made a noticeable effort to be friendly , and ProtagonistA was always ready to help out anyone who needed it 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would be happy to help ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB the name of a good friend of ProtagonistA who was looking for a new runner 
ProtagonistA discovered the existence of the world in a paper which was stuck on the back of ProtagonistB's desk , and which ProtagonistA picked up and read from time to time 
 ProtagonistA had always been a curious person , and so when ProtagonistA saw the paper ProtagonistA was intrigued 
 ProtagonistA read it from front to back , and then back to front again 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe what ProtagonistA was reading 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB about the paper , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had found it in a library 
 ProtagonistA was eager to go to the library and find out more about this new world 
 ProtagonistA agreed to the request , and the two men had a nice chat about the upcoming wedding 
ProtagonistA was hunting down a rabbit when ProtagonistA heard the awful noise of the gunfight 
 ProtagonistA quickly ran towards the noise to see what was happening 
 When ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA saw two men shooting at each other 
 ProtagonistA yelled at them to stop , but they did n't listen 
 ProtagonistA then ran over and tackled one of the men 
 ProtagonistA helped ProtagonistB up and asked ProtagonistB what was going on 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB would go get help 
 ProtagonistA ran to the nearest town and got the sheriff 
 ProtagonistA told the sheriff what happened and the sheriff went to go help ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had dropped into the school , not knowing why ProtagonistA was there ; it was as though ProtagonistA 'd been dropped into the middle of nowhere 
 ProtagonistA looked around , confused , until ProtagonistA's eyes landed on a sign that read  Welcome to Middleton High School !  ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief ; ProtagonistA must have gotten lost on ProtagonistA's way here 
 ProtagonistA walked into the building , looking for the office , when ProtagonistA heard a voice call ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB , waving at ProtagonistA from down the hall 
 ProtagonistA wandered around the school , taking in the sights and sounds of high school life ; it was so different from when ProtagonistA was last here 
 ProtagonistA eventually made ProtagonistA's way to the office , where ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA drawn to a display case full of trophies 
 ProtagonistA smiled to ProtagonistA , remembering the days when ProtagonistA was a star athlete here 
 ProtagonistA turned to ProtagonistC , expecting to be scolded for trespassing , but ProtagonistC just smiled and said ,  Welcome back , ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been walking very slow all morning , reaching ProtagonistA's destination in the town of Trafalgar , about eight miles south of Manchester 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and blistered 
 ProtagonistA was looking forward to sitting down and resting for a while 
 When ProtagonistA finally arrived in Trafalgar , ProtagonistA sat down on a bench in the town square and took off ProtagonistA's shoes and socks 
 ProtagonistA massaged ProtagonistA's feet for a few minutes , then put ProtagonistA's shoes back on and stood up 
 ProtagonistA looked around at the shops and businesses in the square , and noticed a sign in the window of a cafe that said  Help Wanted 
  ProtagonistA went inside and asked about the job 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was interested and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to start the next day 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have found a job so quickly 
 ProtagonistA is now a happy employee of the cafe , and ProtagonistA enjoys spending ProtagonistA's days chatting with the customers and getting to know the people of Trafalgar 
ProtagonistA was getting anxious 
 ProtagonistA had given ProtagonistB a simple task to do and it was taking longer than expected 
 Finally , ProtagonistA decided to call ProtagonistB to see what was taking so long 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to check in and see how ProtagonistB 're doing with the task ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA do n't want to have to give this task to someone else 
 ProtagonistA hung up the phone and sighed 
 ProtagonistA hoped ProtagonistB would hurry up and finish the task so ProtagonistA could move on to other things 
ProtagonistA had been married to ProtagonistB for over 20 years 
 Every day , ProtagonistA would come home from work and ProtagonistB would have dinner waiting for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA would stand in the kitchen , looking at the empty oven , and it would hurt ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to move on , but it was so hard 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to do it without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been dating ProtagonistB for a few months and things seemed to be going well 
 ProtagonistA decided to try to win ProtagonistB back 
 ProtagonistA showered ProtagonistB with gifts and flowers , and even wrote ProtagonistB's love letters 
 ProtagonistA should have known it was over when ProtagonistB broke up with ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA was such a fool in the beginning that ProtagonistA just could n't let go 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA just stood there , looking around 
 Then ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
  Do ProtagonistA want to play with us ?  ProtagonistA nodded , and ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA's hand 
 Soon , ProtagonistA was having fun , too 
 ProtagonistA forgot all about the green hall and the other kids in it 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a troublemaker 
 As a young man , ProtagonistA was always getting into mischief 
 But , ProtagonistA was also a man of ProtagonistA's word 
 When ProtagonistA made a promise , ProtagonistA kept it 
 ProtagonistA wanted to start fresh and be known for being honest 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner 
 ProtagonistA never really fit in with any group of friends 
 But , ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's own company 
 ProtagonistA liked to read and explore the world around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA wanted to start fresh and see if ProtagonistA could make a new life for ProtagonistA 
 So far , ProtagonistA was doing well 
 ProtagonistA had found a job that ProtagonistA liked and was making new friends 
 ProtagonistA was even dating ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA still felt like ProtagonistA was lying to everyone 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA could keep up the act of being someone ProtagonistA wasn't 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to tell ProtagonistB the truth 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's past and why ProtagonistA had changed ProtagonistA's name 
 And , ProtagonistA was finally able to start living ProtagonistA's life the way ProtagonistA wanted to 
Once upon a time , when the world was young , ProtagonistA was walking home one cold Thursday evening in August 
 ProtagonistA came upon a little stone church on a green and flowery street , or in better letters Rickson , on the south side of that city , in which the main thoroughfares led down to the narrow streets and galleries of the lower part of the town 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , then decided to go in 
 ProtagonistA sat down in a pew and let out a deep sigh 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure how long ProtagonistA sat there , but eventually ProtagonistA became aware of someone moving around in the church 
 ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes to see ProtagonistB coming down the aisle , carrying a broom 
 ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's feet and smiled 
 ProtagonistA was just about to leave anyway 
 As ProtagonistA walked out of the church , ProtagonistA felt a sense of calm and well - being that ProtagonistA had not felt in a long time 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would come back to this place again 
ProtagonistA was out for a walk one day when ProtagonistA came across a strange creature ProtagonistA had never seen before 
 ProtagonistA decided to approach it and see if ProtagonistA could make friends with this strange little creature 
 When ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that the creature was actually a fairy ! ProtagonistA had never seen a real fairy before and was quite excited 
 ProtagonistA introduced ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was amazed by all the things ProtagonistB could do with ProtagonistB's magic and ProtagonistA loved hearing ProtagonistB's stories about the world of the fairies 
 But ProtagonistA was happy to have made ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA knew they would always keep in touch 
ProtagonistA , in the year 1581 , appeared on the scene with a discovery ProtagonistA could not have dreamed of three years before : in the journal of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA found two passages which ProtagonistA named The Book of Dreams 
 ProtagonistA was amazed by these passages and decided to try to find the city of glass and the flying man 
 ProtagonistA set out on a journey and , after many adventures , ProtagonistA found the city of glass 
 ProtagonistA also found the flying man , who turned out to be ProtagonistB was amazed at ProtagonistA's discovery and decided to write a book about it 
Not long ago , when ProtagonistA was a boy , when ProtagonistA only knew how to read and write , ProtagonistA sent ProtagonistB a card that read : Beg for ProtagonistB's help 
 ProtagonistA never forgot how ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA's rescue when ProtagonistA needed ProtagonistB the most 
 ProtagonistA was always loitering around the park , and ProtagonistB was sure ProtagonistA was up to no good 
 ProtagonistA 're not going to terrorize this park anymore 
  ProtagonistA tried to run , but ProtagonistB was faster 
ProtagonistA sat in the saddle and considered the plan ProtagonistA 'd been given 
 ProtagonistA was to ride into town and ask around for ProtagonistB 
 Once ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was to bring ProtagonistB back to the ranch 
 ProtagonistA had never been good at talking to women , and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would n't be any different 
 But , ProtagonistA was a man of ProtagonistA's word , and ProtagonistA would do as ProtagonistA was asked 
 ProtagonistA just hoped that ProtagonistA would n't make a fool of ProtagonistA in the process 
ProtagonistA had a solid build , and a big , broad smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA was always the life of the party , and always had a kind word for everyone 
 ProtagonistA was the kind of guy that you just could n't help but like 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking around ProtagonistA's neighborhood , when ProtagonistA ran into ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA listened patiently , and then offered some words of encouragement 
 ProtagonistB was surprised at how positive ProtagonistA was , and it made ProtagonistB feel a little better 
 ProtagonistA continued on ProtagonistA's way , spreading ProtagonistA's happiness and good cheer to everyone ProtagonistA met 
 ProtagonistA was always making people smile , and that was one of the things that made ProtagonistA so special 
ProtagonistA had been on the road for months , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to get homesick 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's cozy little house and ProtagonistA's comfortable bed 
 Most of all , ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been all over the world , and ProtagonistA had seen some amazing things , but ProtagonistA was ready to be done with this whole traveling business 
 ProtagonistA wanted to go home and take a long nap 
 One morning , ProtagonistA woke up in ProtagonistA's hotel room in Japan and decided that today was the day ProtagonistA was going to head back home 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to be home , and ProtagonistA vowed to never go on another long journey again 
 ProtagonistA might not be a good unicorn , but ProtagonistA 's not going anywhere 
 ProtagonistA was grateful to ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's kindness , and ProtagonistA vowed to never leave ProtagonistB's side 
ProtagonistA woke up from ProtagonistA's dream feeling very confused 
 ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was in a vast garden , surrounded by a crowd of people 
 ProtagonistA saw a historian , a naturalist , a sculptor , and racing horses 
 ProtagonistA also saw one or two ladies standing upon a hill 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what was going on 
 Then ProtagonistA heard someone say ,  Welcome to ProtagonistA's future , ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB standing there 
 ProtagonistB continued ,  ProtagonistA are going to have a very special role to play in this world 
 ProtagonistA are going to be a great leader 
  ProtagonistA was surprised to hear this 
 ProtagonistA did n't feel like ProtagonistA was anything special 
 ProtagonistA must embrace it 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure if it was all a dream or not , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistA's future 
 ProtagonistA was a big man , and ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA did n't kill ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB would kill ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA did n't want to die 
 ProtagonistA wanted to live 
 ProtagonistA wanted to eat ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA could n't kill ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA just could n't do it 
 ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's father and the only family ProtagonistB had ever known 
ProtagonistA died 
 ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistB do n't know why anyone would want to rob ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was a nice guy 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a trouble , but ProtagonistA had been more of a bother than most when ProtagonistA had been twelve 
 ProtagonistA had gotten into a lot of fights and had been kicked out of school 
 ProtagonistA had been a lost cause 
 ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA falling for ProtagonistB and , for the first time in ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA wanted to be a better person 
 ProtagonistA wanted to make ProtagonistB proud of ProtagonistA 
 And so ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA stopped getting into fights and ProtagonistA went back to school 
 ProtagonistA even got good grades 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB's most recent folly 
 ProtagonistA cried out ,  Wait , that 's a new plot ! ProtagonistA have to see this !  ProtagonistA ran over to where ProtagonistB was and watched as ProtagonistB executed ProtagonistB's plan 
As soon as ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the bed and stared out the window 
 ProtagonistA would be in ProtagonistA's bed , in ProtagonistA's room and ProtagonistA would wake up to find ProtagonistA in a strange place 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what the dream meant , but ProtagonistA was starting to get worried 
 ProtagonistA got up and went to the window , looking out at the city below 
 ProtagonistA had always loved the city , but now it just felt like a prison 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going crazy 
 ProtagonistA just shook ProtagonistA's head and said ProtagonistA did n't know 
 ProtagonistA could n't tell ProtagonistB about the dream , ProtagonistA did n't want ProtagonistB to think ProtagonistA was losing ProtagonistA's mind 
 ProtagonistA nodded , but ProtagonistA did n't feel any better 
 ProtagonistA was still scared and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
ProtagonistA had been studying the chart for hours , and ProtagonistA was finally able to make sense of it 
 ProtagonistA was going to be famous 
 ProtagonistA quickly packed ProtagonistA's things and set off for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was going to be the first person to find ProtagonistB in over two thousand years 
 ProtagonistA arrived at the coordinates ProtagonistA had found on the chart , and there ProtagonistB was : ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had done it 
 ProtagonistA quickly took some pictures and then made ProtagonistA's way back to civilization to share ProtagonistA's discovery with the world 
 ProtagonistA was going to be famous 
 ProtagonistA was lying on the ground , motionless 
 ProtagonistA had been with ProtagonistA since they were both young men , and now ProtagonistA was gone 
ProtagonistA came in a beaten and battered carriage and was carrying ProtagonistB across the country 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's life , and this was just another adventure 
 ProtagonistB was injured and needed help , so ProtagonistA was going to take ProtagonistB to the nearest town 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what was going to happen , but ProtagonistA was ready for anything 
 ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to save ProtagonistB , but it was too late 
 Now , ProtagonistA was all alone in the world 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner , but now ProtagonistA felt truly isolated 
 ProtagonistA had no one to turn to in ProtagonistA's time of need 
 ProtagonistA had to keep going , for ProtagonistB's sake 
 With a heavy heart , ProtagonistA continued on 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would want ProtagonistA to live and be happy , even if ProtagonistA could n't be there with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was a very average looking guy 
 ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB and two kids 
 ProtagonistA worked at a factory 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's wife and kids very much 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to lose them 
 ProtagonistA decided to try to win ProtagonistB back 
 ProtagonistA started to do things that ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB liked 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB out on dates and bought ProtagonistB's flowers 
 ProtagonistA did everything ProtagonistA could think of 
 ProtagonistA was so happy 
 ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had tried to win ProtagonistB back 
ProtagonistA had been standing in the doorway all night , waiting for ProtagonistB 
 As the hours passed , ProtagonistA began to doubt ProtagonistB would ever show up 
 ProtagonistA was just about to give up and go to bed when ProtagonistA heard a noise outside 
 ProtagonistA looked out the window and saw ProtagonistB walking up the path 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA ran out to meet ProtagonistB 
 They spent the night catching up and ProtagonistA was happy to finally have ProtagonistB back in ProtagonistA's life 
In the early summer of 1831 , ProtagonistA was living in the vast old house of ProtagonistA's cousin , the lady Madame Bors ( the name of the owner of the property ) , in a part of Pannonward called the Park 
 ProtagonistA had been living there for several months , and ProtagonistA loved it 
 ProtagonistA loved the peace and quiet of the Park , and ProtagonistA loved the company of ProtagonistB 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the Park when ProtagonistA came across a small , abandoned house 
 ProtagonistA was curious , so ProtagonistA went inside 
 ProtagonistA explored the house , and ProtagonistA found a secret room 
 Inside the secret room , ProtagonistA found a treasure trove of old coins and jewelry 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had been trying to have a baby for years 
 ProtagonistA was over the moon 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it had finally happened 
 ProtagonistA was going to be a dad 
 ProtagonistA reassured ProtagonistB that everything would be alright 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would be there for ProtagonistB's every step of the way 
 ProtagonistA thought about it for a while and then said that ProtagonistA would love a dog 
ProtagonistA was a handsome and charming man , though ProtagonistA's appearance sometimes caused consternation in ProtagonistA's fellow travellers 
 ProtagonistA was well known throughout the city and was always friendly and helpful 
 One day , ProtagonistA was helping ProtagonistB with ProtagonistB's luggage when ProtagonistA slipped and fell , hitting ProtagonistA's head on a rock 
 When ProtagonistA finally woke up , ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's memory 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistA was or where ProtagonistA came from 
 ProtagonistA did n't know ProtagonistB's name , but ProtagonistA was determined to find ProtagonistB 
 With the help of ProtagonistA's friends , ProtagonistA was able to find ProtagonistB and return ProtagonistB's luggage to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA still does n't remember who ProtagonistA is , but ProtagonistA is happy living ProtagonistA's life helping others 
 ProtagonistA was the daughter of Henry Vane , Earl of Essex , cousin of King James ; and , as is usual with them , ProtagonistA's father was a king 
 ProtagonistA was a very beautiful young woman , and ProtagonistA had a very kind heart 
 ProtagonistA was always helping others , and ProtagonistA was always trying to make everyone happy 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the forest , and ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong , and ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB was lost 
 ProtagonistA offered to help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's way home , and ProtagonistB did 
 ProtagonistA was always well - dressed and had a kind face 
 One evening , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was going to leave town 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had been offered a job in a faraway place and ProtagonistA was going to take it 
 ProtagonistA left town the next day , and ProtagonistB never saw ProtagonistA again 
 And so , ProtagonistA built a house for the phoenix on ProtagonistA's farm 
ProtagonistA was a bright young boy , but ProtagonistA was always a little bit different from the other kids at school 
 ProtagonistA had bright red hair , and bright blue eyes , and ProtagonistA always seemed to be looking at the world in a different way 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to make of it , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were different 
ProtagonistA had been sleeping all that time and was still sleeping when ProtagonistA began to cry 
ProtagonistA stood on the doorstep of ProtagonistA's house , watching ProtagonistB , drive into the town with ProtagonistB's wife 
 ProtagonistA felt a pang of jealousy as ProtagonistA watched the two of them drive off together 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA should be happy for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit left out 
 ProtagonistA went back inside the house and sat down at the kitchen table 
 ProtagonistA got up to see who it was and was surprised to see ProtagonistB getting out of the car 
 That 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said , trying to hide the relief in ProtagonistA's voice 
  Do ProtagonistA want to come into town with us?No , that 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA 'll just stay here 
 Yeah , ProtagonistA 'm sure ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA watched them go , feeling a little bit lonely 
ProtagonistA is sitting down by the window , reading a book which ProtagonistA has brought into ProtagonistA's room , and without speaking 
 ProtagonistA has read it many times before , but ProtagonistA always enjoys reading it again 
 ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistB is someone who is just like ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had always wanted a man with blond hair , but when ProtagonistA was eight the first color on ProtagonistA's face changed into something untidy and unpleasant 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's identity 
 ProtagonistA did n't feel like ProtagonistA belonged anywhere 
 ProtagonistA did n't feel like ProtagonistA was attractive anymore 
 ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA was invisible 
 One day , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was so handsome and ProtagonistA could n't take ProtagonistA's eyes off of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt a stirring in ProtagonistA's heart and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was the man ProtagonistA had been waiting for 
 ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistB's hair was n't blond anymore , ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB for who ProtagonistB was 
 ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's only child , and ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA dearly 
 ProtagonistA was a happy child , always laughing and playing 
 ProtagonistA was never naughty , and always did as ProtagonistA was told 
 ProtagonistA ran to ProtagonistB , crying and screaming for help 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA would go on without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had to be strong , and ProtagonistA slowly began to heal 
 ProtagonistA started to laugh and play again , and ProtagonistA even went back to the park 
 Now , every time ProtagonistA visits the park , ProtagonistA thinks of ProtagonistB and the wonderful times they had together 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistB is always with ProtagonistA , watching over ProtagonistA from the stars 
 ProtagonistA was driving erratically , and ProtagonistB was having a hard time keeping up 
ProtagonistA was a simple man who loved the way things were done 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life and did n't want for anything more 
 ProtagonistA was a good man , ProtagonistA was 
 Then , one day , ProtagonistA came to the palace and presented the head of a dragon to ProtagonistD 
ProtagonistA had never seen anything like China before 
 ProtagonistA instantly fell in love with the country and its people 
 So , when ProtagonistA was old enough , ProtagonistA set off with Yede , ProtagonistB's donkey , to the Chinese orphanage where ProtagonistA had been born 
 Finally , ProtagonistA arrived at the orphanage 
 ProtagonistA quickly adapted to life at the orphanage 
 ProtagonistA loved learning about Chinese culture and history 
 ProtagonistA had found a home in China and was destined to give birth to an immortal emperor 
 ProtagonistA was a very happy man 
 ProtagonistA had a great job , a beautiful wife , and two lovely children 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 However , one day ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was grateful to ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA soon fell in love with ProtagonistB 
Over the last three years , when I have been able to visit the house where ProtagonistA fathomed ProtagonistA's dreams , ProtagonistA has changed little 
 ProtagonistA had this sparkle in ProtagonistA's eye , and I could tell ProtagonistA was truly passionate about life 
 ProtagonistB had always been the more impulsive one , but ProtagonistA had always been the one to hold ProtagonistB back 
 ProtagonistA was inconsolable after the funeral 
 ProtagonistA blamed ProtagonistA for ProtagonistB's death and felt like ProtagonistA did n't deserve to live 
 ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that ProtagonistB was still with ProtagonistA , somehow 
 As the days went by , ProtagonistA started to notice strange things happening 
 ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistA in places ProtagonistA did n't remember going to , and ProtagonistA had strange dreams 
 At first , ProtagonistA thought it was just ProtagonistA's mind playing tricks on ProtagonistA , but the more ProtagonistA thought about it , the more ProtagonistA realized it was true 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't tell anyone about it , because they would never believe ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA had to be careful , because if ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA would stay dead 
 ProtagonistA started to live ProtagonistA's life differently after that 
 ProtagonistA was more careful and deliberate in everything ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA also started to appreciate life more , because ProtagonistA knew how precious it was 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to make the most of ProtagonistA's time , because ProtagonistA now had eternity 
 ProtagonistA was a simple man , and ProtagonistA did n't understand why ProtagonistB would do such a thing 
 ProtagonistA had always been a good cook , and ProtagonistA had never done anything to deserve this 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's palace , and ProtagonistA begged ProtagonistB to lift the ban on ProtagonistA's cookery 
 ProtagonistA pleaded with ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB would not listen 
 ProtagonistA went home , and ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do 
 ProtagonistA loved cooking , and it was ProtagonistA's passion 
 Without it , ProtagonistA felt lost 
 ProtagonistA decided to take matters into ProtagonistA's own hands 
 ProtagonistA snuck into ProtagonistB's palace kitchen and ProtagonistA cooked a meal 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be impressed 
 The next day , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's office , and ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB the meal ProtagonistA had cooked 
 ProtagonistA was a great cook , and ProtagonistA went on to have a successful career 
ProtagonistA was walking towards the door of ProtagonistB's room , shaking ProtagonistA's head 
 But as ProtagonistA got closer to the door , ProtagonistA could hear voices coming from inside 
 ProtagonistA paused for a moment , not sure what to do 
 Should ProtagonistA just go in and comfort ProtagonistB ? Or give ProtagonistB some space ? ProtagonistA decided to go in 
 As ProtagonistA walked in , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on the bed , phone in hand 
 ProtagonistA sat down next to ProtagonistB and put ProtagonistA's arm around ProtagonistB 
  It 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA stood there , though ProtagonistA was not quite sure why 
 ProtagonistA could hear a faint noise coming from somewhere , and ProtagonistA started to walk towards it 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that the noise was someone crying 
 ProtagonistA came to a door and slowly opened it 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA had gotten here , or where here even was 
 But ProtagonistA did know that ProtagonistA could n't just leave ProtagonistB here by ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA was old enough , ProtagonistA started working in the fields to help support ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA worked hard every day , rain or shine 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was working , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so excited and could n't believe it was happening 
 ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things and went to the palace to start ProtagonistA's new life 
It was a pity to see ProtagonistA's head , ProtagonistB , all throbbing and squirmy , ProtagonistA's eyes so half - closed , said ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's sweetest voice 
  ProtagonistA just nodded , too exhausted to speak 
 ProtagonistA had been in and out of the hospital for weeks , and it was taking its toll on ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 'll be all right ,  ProtagonistA said finally 
  ProtagonistA just need some rest 
  And with that , ProtagonistA turned over and went to sleep 
 It was a hot summer day and ProtagonistA was out in the yard , tending to ProtagonistA's garden 
 ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the bushes and went to investigate 
 There , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB , meowing pitifully 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB in and nursed ProtagonistB back to health 
 ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB's Mittens and ProtagonistB became ProtagonistA's best friend 
 Over the years , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB grew old together 
 ProtagonistA never expected to love ProtagonistB so much , but ProtagonistB was the best thing that ever happened to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was four years old when ProtagonistA heard the news that ProtagonistC had been murdered 
 It was a cold winter day and ProtagonistA was inside playing with ProtagonistA's toys 
 ProtagonistA could n't hear what they were saying , but ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was upset 
 ProtagonistA was very sad and cried for a long time 
 ProtagonistA , however , seemed to be in a hurry and did not drink more than a few sips before setting ProtagonistA's cup down and getting up from the table 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA must be going now ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA tried to get up , but ProtagonistA felt so weak 
 ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was in a hospital room 
 ProtagonistA must have been in a coma 
 ProtagonistA wanted to cry , but ProtagonistA could n't even do that 
The first time ProtagonistB pulled ProtagonistA out of the park , ProtagonistA was in a tangle of newts , ProtagonistA's body in full view of the other newts 
 ProtagonistA was a mess , ProtagonistA's scales all over the place , and ProtagonistA's eyes were bulging out of ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA was still alive , but ProtagonistA was in a bad way 
The first time ProtagonistB met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was eleven years old 
 ProtagonistA was a new student at ProtagonistB's school , and ProtagonistB was assigned to show ProtagonistA around 
 ProtagonistA was quiet and shy , and ProtagonistA did n't seem to fit in with the other kids 
 ProtagonistA slowly started to open up , and before long , ProtagonistA was just another member of ProtagonistB's group of friends 
 But now , ProtagonistA had to take ProtagonistB down 
 ProtagonistA was the only one who could 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and steadied ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had to do this 
 ProtagonistA raised ProtagonistA's gun and aimed 
 And then ProtagonistA pulled the trigger 
ProtagonistA had seen death before 
 ProtagonistA had seen it in the eyes of ProtagonistA's patients , in their final moments 
 ProtagonistA knew the look of a person who was about to die 
 But ProtagonistA had never seen it in the eyes of someone so young 
 Fourteen years ago , when ProtagonistA was conducting ProtagonistA's last examination of ProtagonistA's patients , ProtagonistA had an idea of what might befall ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be consumed by fear , that ProtagonistB would be tortured by the thought of ProtagonistB's own mortality 
 ProtagonistA knew that there was nothing ProtagonistA could do to ease ProtagonistB's suffering , but ProtagonistA stayed with ProtagonistB anyway , until the end 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA needed to find a way to help people come to terms with their own mortality 
 And so ProtagonistA started a support group for people who were afraid of death 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistB's death was not in vain , and that ProtagonistB's legacy will live on through the people ProtagonistA has helped 
ProtagonistA was a kindly old man who loved to help others 
 So when ProtagonistA saw the state of the flat , ProtagonistA was appalled 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door and was let in by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA offered to help them clean up the place and to get them some food and supplies 
 ProtagonistA continued to help the tenants , and ProtagonistA soon became a good friend to them 
 ProtagonistA was always there for them when they needed help , and ProtagonistA was proud to have made a difference in their lives 
 ProtagonistA was a small town in the middle of nowhere 
ProtagonistA was a very pretty girl , with dark hair which fell to ProtagonistA's shoulders , a light complexion , strong eyebrows and a shining face 
 ProtagonistA was very excited to be there and to see all the sights 
 ProtagonistA sat on a bench and watched the people go by 
 ProtagonistA saw a lot of pretty girls , but none as pretty as ProtagonistA 
 After a while , ProtagonistA got up and walked around 
 ProtagonistA looked in shop windows and at the people in the street 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do next 
 ProtagonistA walked around for a while longer , and then ProtagonistA saw a sign for a museum 
 ProtagonistA had never been to a museum before , so ProtagonistA decided to go in 
 ProtagonistA looked at all the paintings and the sculptures 
 ProtagonistA was so fascinated by everything that ProtagonistA forgot to look at the time 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA started to panic , but then ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA went up to ProtagonistB and asked for help 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was lost and did n't know how to get home 
 ProtagonistA was very excited to tell ProtagonistA's parents about all the things ProtagonistA had seen 
 ProtagonistA had a great day , even though ProtagonistA got lost 
 ProtagonistA had never even seen a picture of them 
ProtagonistA was going to have to kill ProtagonistB 
 It was nothing personal , ProtagonistA just could n't have ProtagonistB around anymore 
 ProtagonistA sat down on the arm of the chair , looking into ProtagonistB's eyes 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
  But ProtagonistA have to do this 
 ProtagonistA reached for the knife on the table and plunged it into ProtagonistB's chest 
 ProtagonistA cleaned up the mess and disposed of the body 
 ProtagonistA set about ProtagonistA's task with a will , and within a few weeks had found ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA had done ProtagonistA's duty , and ProtagonistA was happy to see ProtagonistB so well - matched 
 After the wedding , ProtagonistA continued to run the household for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistA was content in ProtagonistA's work 
 ProtagonistA grew up to be a normal boy , but ProtagonistA always had a special place in ProtagonistA's heart for ProtagonistA's parents who loved ProtagonistA no matter what 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB lived in a small cove along the southern shore of an old lake 
 ProtagonistA always carried around the memory of the time when ProtagonistB had cheated on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistB all over again 
One day ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's home town to go to boarding school 
 All the while ProtagonistA had a secret which ProtagonistB was in search of 
 ProtagonistA had never told anyone about this ability , not even ProtagonistA's parents , for fear of being considered a freak 
 ProtagonistA was shy and withdrawn and missed ProtagonistA's family and home terribly 
 But ProtagonistA soon made some friends and settled into a routine 
 ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB was looking for 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but then ProtagonistA thought about how exciting it would be to use ProtagonistA's power to help someone 
 ProtagonistA agreed to help ProtagonistB , and they set off on their adventure 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's cousin were having lunch at the upper end of the city 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to get involved in whatever was going on 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to get involved 
 ProtagonistA just stood there , feeling like a coward 
 ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA's cousin had helped ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA wished that ProtagonistA had been brave enough to do it ProtagonistA 
Ever since the dark nights of the past , when ProtagonistA had been orphan and immature , and brought to the surface of madness by the combination of innocence with evil , the beautiful , innocent face of ProtagonistA , had been a source of terror to ProtagonistB , and perhaps to ProtagonistA , and one of the most uncertain and troublesome situations of childhood 
 As if ProtagonistA was a different person altogether 
 ProtagonistA grabbed ProtagonistB and started to strangle ProtagonistB 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA stopped strangling ProtagonistB and looked at ProtagonistB with a confused expression on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA just stood there , looking at ProtagonistB , and then ProtagonistA turned and walked out of the room 
 ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA went to the inn , ProtagonistA would most likely die in the cold and damp 
 However , ProtagonistA was not sure if it was worth it to go to ProtagonistB's house and die in the heat 
 In the end , ProtagonistA decided to go to ProtagonistB's house 
 When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistB had already passed away 
 ProtagonistA died shortly after from the heat 
ProtagonistA had once left a large sum of money and ProtagonistA's house in London for the purpose of making a new life for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had wanted a man who would be faithful to ProtagonistA in the world 
 ProtagonistA had met many men who had promised to be faithful , but they had all eventually betrayed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had almost given up hope of finding someone who would truly love ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA believed ProtagonistB and they began a life together 
 ProtagonistA was happier than ProtagonistA had ever been and ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistB was the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA 
 However , one day ProtagonistA came home and found ProtagonistB in bed with another man 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe that ProtagonistB had betrayed ProtagonistA after everything they had been through together 
 ProtagonistA left ProtagonistB and never looked back 
 ProtagonistA vowed to never trust another man again 
ProtagonistA was a mother 's lady and ProtagonistB was the nicest girl in the world 
 ProtagonistA was very proud of ProtagonistB and loved ProtagonistB very much 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to go on without ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be strong for ProtagonistA's wife and other daughter 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would want ProtagonistA to be happy and to keep living 
 ProtagonistA lived for ProtagonistB and tried to make the best of every day 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit odd , and ProtagonistB was the only one who ever really understood ProtagonistA 
The last time they saw each other , ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's seventh year 
 ProtagonistA had stayed in touch with some of ProtagonistA's old friends from work , but ProtagonistA had n't seen them in years 
 ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB in years , but ProtagonistA had always thought of ProtagonistB fondly 
 ProtagonistA decided to go to ProtagonistB's funeral , and ProtagonistA was surprised to see how many people had turned out 
 ProtagonistA was even more surprised when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC 
ProtagonistA had always been a bright boy 
 ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's only nephew , and ProtagonistB had always been close to ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA opened the door , ProtagonistA was shocked to see ProtagonistB's murderer standing there 
ProtagonistA had been walking home from work , minding ProtagonistA's own business , when ProtagonistA ran into ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA was going to die 
 ProtagonistA had never expected ProtagonistB to be anything other than a violent thug 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have found a friend in ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was grateful that their first meeting had n't ended in tragedy 
ProtagonistA was going to stop calling ProtagonistB  ProtagonistD ,  said ProtagonistC , though ProtagonistA did not know at the time what ProtagonistA called ProtagonistA , or what ProtagonistA regarded as ProtagonistA 
  But ProtagonistA liked ProtagonistB , despite ProtagonistB's quirks , and ProtagonistA did n't see any reason to stop calling ProtagonistB by ProtagonistD 
  ProtagonistA thought for a moment and then explained that ProtagonistB was just different from everyone else and that ProtagonistA liked ProtagonistB for that 
ProtagonistA flung open the white door of ProtagonistA's kitchen and directed ProtagonistB to the dining room 
 ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB to a seat at the table and then went back to the kitchen to finish preparing dinner 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistA came back into the room carrying a tray of food 
 ProtagonistA set it down in front of ProtagonistB and then took a seat across from ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was content to let ProtagonistB eat ProtagonistB's fill before ProtagonistA started asking questions 
 ProtagonistA listened patiently , only interjecting to ask the occasional question 
 When ProtagonistB was done eating , ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's company and showed ProtagonistB to the door 
 ProtagonistB was clearly reluctant to leave , but ProtagonistA was adamant 
 ProtagonistA said goodbye and watched as ProtagonistB walked down the path to the street 
 ProtagonistA went back inside and returned to the kitchen 
 ProtagonistA was content to have made a new friend , even if it was a bit unusual 
ProtagonistA was a stranger , and a stranger that ProtagonistA was , if ProtagonistA had been anything like any other woman of flesh or blood 
 ProtagonistA came to ProtagonistB's door one day , seeking shelter from the rain 
 But one day , ProtagonistA disappeared , and ProtagonistB never saw ProtagonistA again 
 ProtagonistA was only in ProtagonistA's early 30s and was in good health 
ProtagonistA was sixteen and in love , and ProtagonistA was going to have to kill someone 
 ProtagonistA had never wanted to hurt anyone , but ProtagonistA's love for ProtagonistB was so strong that ProtagonistA would do anything for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA could n't let that happen 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB too much 
 So ProtagonistA steeled ProtagonistA for the task ahead , and on the night of the big gang showdown , ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB's father 
 And ProtagonistA would do it again in a heartbeat , if it meant that ProtagonistB could be ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was a good and kind woman , and as such ProtagonistA would not have anything to do with a sick man 
 ProtagonistA was content to live ProtagonistA's life alone , without the hassle of caring for someone else 
 However , one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA could not turn away from ProtagonistB , and so ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB in and cared for ProtagonistB 
 From then on , ProtagonistA made it ProtagonistA's mission to help as many sick people as ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA 's tried everything to get ProtagonistB to see reason , but ProtagonistB just wo n't listen 
 ProtagonistA ca n't concentrate on anything with their constant squawking and ProtagonistA 's starting to feel like ProtagonistA 's going insane 
 One day , ProtagonistA snaps 
 ProtagonistA ca n't take it anymore and ProtagonistA starts yelling at ProtagonistB , telling ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB needs to get rid of the birds 
 ProtagonistA starts throwing things , smashing the bird cages and freeing the birds 
 ProtagonistA does n't know what to do now 
 ProtagonistA 's ruined everything and ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistB will never forgive ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA can only hope that someday ProtagonistB 'll be able to forgive ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA knows it will be a long time before that happens 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA 'd killed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 'd been planning it for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA 'd found out about ProtagonistB's dark secret 
 ProtagonistA had always been a good person , but ProtagonistA could n't let ProtagonistB's evil continue 
 So ProtagonistA snuck into ProtagonistB's chambers one night and stabbed ProtagonistB in the heart 
 ProtagonistA felt a surge of triumph as ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA 'd done the world a great service 
 But then ProtagonistB's body began to glow and ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA 'd made a mistake 
 ProtagonistA had only killed ProtagonistB's physical body - the magic inside ProtagonistB was still alive and well 
 ProtagonistA begged for forgiveness , but it was too late 
ProtagonistA was in the midst of the courtyard around ProtagonistA's apartment when ProtagonistA saw a rat dart by 
 ProtagonistA was so startled that ProtagonistA jumped up and ran back inside 
ProtagonistA was overjoyed when ProtagonistA's wife gave birth to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA decided to take the day off from work to spend time with ProtagonistA's new family 
The last night ProtagonistA had been on earth , ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
ProtagonistA rode ProtagonistA's yellow horse through the desert , looking for any sign of life 
 ProtagonistA had been riding for days , and was getting very tired 
 Finally , ProtagonistA came to a city where old walls and towers still stood 
 ProtagonistA rode through the city , and felt like something was watching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA rode to the center of the city , and stopped 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was being watched , but ProtagonistA could n't see anyone 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt something touch ProtagonistA's shoulder , and ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistB standing there 
 ProtagonistA was amazed , and did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's destiny was to save the world , and ProtagonistA would do whatever it took to make sure that happened 
ProtagonistA had been looking forward to ProtagonistB's visit all year 
 ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's only child , and ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA pushed back ProtagonistB's heavy trunk and waded through the mud to the car 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping for a warm reunion , but it was clear that ProtagonistB was not happy to be there 
 ProtagonistA tried to make the best of it , but it was clear that ProtagonistB was not interested in spending time with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was going through a tough time in ProtagonistB's life 
 One day , ProtagonistA came home and found ProtagonistB in the kitchen , crying 
 ProtagonistA sat down with ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA had had no idea 
 ProtagonistA listened as ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's struggles and ProtagonistB's fears 
 ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistB for being so brave and for opening up to ProtagonistA 
 Since that day , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB have been inseparable 
 ProtagonistA is grateful that ProtagonistB came to visit , even though it was tough at first 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistB is the most important person in ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA am a man of thirty - nine years , and a thousand and one years ago at the beginning of the twelfth century ProtagonistA , appeared in the court of the first emperor Constantine , who was a God of the Jews , and ordered the execution of four hundred and fifty - two religious and political persons 
 ProtagonistA eventually made ProtagonistA's way to the court of ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistA retired from public life and lived out ProtagonistA's days in peace 
In those days there was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was a good , honest man , and a man of sense , and ProtagonistA knew what was good for ProtagonistA ; and ProtagonistA was called Adam , and ProtagonistA was wise 
 And ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB's name was Eve , and ProtagonistB was a good woman , and ProtagonistB was called Eve , because ProtagonistB was the mother of all living 
ProtagonistA was the very boss of all the soldiers , of the high school teachers , and even of the teachers ' wives 
 ProtagonistA had always said that the best way to get information out of ProtagonistB in the future was not to kill ProtagonistB , but to expose ProtagonistB , as ProtagonistB was known to the civilian world , to the light of ridicule 
 So when ProtagonistB was caught stealing a car , ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB paraded through the town square in a chicken suit 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would never want to be exposed to that kind of ridicule again , and ProtagonistB would be more likely to cooperate in the future 
ProtagonistA was a fourth year Muggleborn , and had , as such , come to the city of London on the last leg of ProtagonistA's journey from the Gringotts bank 
 ProtagonistA was on the verge of turning around and going back to the safety of the bank when ProtagonistA heard a scream 
 Without thinking , ProtagonistA ran towards the sound 
 As ProtagonistA turned into the alley , ProtagonistA saw a group of men surrounding ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was just a fourth year student 
 ProtagonistA was n't a hero 
 But ProtagonistA had to do something 
 ProtagonistA stepped forward and spoke in a voice that ProtagonistA hoped was more confident than ProtagonistA felt 
 ProtagonistA reached into ProtagonistA's pocket and pulled out ProtagonistA's wand 
 ProtagonistA pointed it at the men and shouted ,  Stupefy!Nothing happened 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was in trouble now 
 But ProtagonistA had to try 
 ProtagonistA threw ProtagonistA at the nearest man , punching and kicking with all ProtagonistA's might 
 ProtagonistA tried to get up , but ProtagonistA was too weak 
 ProtagonistA tried to fight back , but it was futile 
 ProtagonistA looked up to see ProtagonistB standing over ProtagonistA , wand in hand 
 ProtagonistA tried to get up , but ProtagonistA's vision was swimming 
 ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB's voice , but ProtagonistA could n't make out the words 
Whatever ProtagonistA was , ProtagonistA was a brilliant boy 
 ProtagonistA had a knack for math and science , and ProtagonistA always seemed to be one step ahead of ProtagonistA's classmates 
 ProtagonistA was the type of boy who always had ProtagonistB's nose in a book , and ProtagonistB was always eager to learn more 
 ProtagonistA nodded ProtagonistA's understanding , and the other students in the class began to ask their own questions 
 It was clear to everyone that ProtagonistA was a brilliant boy 
The next day , after ProtagonistA had sent for the servants , ProtagonistA lay down on the front steps of the Black family house and watched as ProtagonistC poured cup after cup of tea for the household and the servants 
 ProtagonistA was happy to be home 
 ProtagonistA came home ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA ca n't just come home ! ProtagonistA have to go back to the city and get a ProtagonistB was about to say more , but ProtagonistC came out and put ProtagonistC's hand on ProtagonistB's arm 
  ProtagonistA can stay here with us 
  But ProtagonistA 's going to have to get a job soon 
 ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB go , then turned to ProtagonistC 
 Thank ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistA said 
 Brown , and ProtagonistB was a very good woman , and ProtagonistB managed the house very well , and ProtagonistA was very well satisfied with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been planning this for months and ProtagonistA was not going to let anything stop ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA walked calmly to the desk of ProtagonistB and pulled out a gun 
 ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB's footsteps echo down the hallway as ProtagonistB ran to get help 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA did n't have much time 
 ProtagonistA went to the first door on the left and opened it 
 ProtagonistA went to the desk and sat down in the chair 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be quick 
 ProtagonistA typed in the username and password that ProtagonistA had been given 
 Then ProtagonistA opened the file that ProtagonistA was looking for 
 ProtagonistA quickly scanned through it , looking for the information ProtagonistA needed 
 ProtagonistA found what ProtagonistA was looking for and copied it to a USB drive 
 Then ProtagonistA heard footsteps coming down the hallway 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to go 
 ProtagonistA put the USB drive in ProtagonistA's pocket and ran out of the room 
 ProtagonistA could hear the footsteps getting closer , but ProtagonistA did n't look back 
 ProtagonistA ran to the main door and opened it 
 Then ProtagonistA was outside 
 ProtagonistA ran down the street and did n't stop until ProtagonistA was safe 
ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB 
 Now , as ProtagonistA watched the other kids ' jaws drop in envy , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB had been right 
 ProtagonistA had loved ProtagonistB dearly , and ProtagonistB's passing had left a great hole in ProtagonistA's heart 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should get up and go home , but ProtagonistA could n't bear to leave the spot where ProtagonistB had died 
 ProtagonistA lay there for a long time , until ProtagonistA finally fell into a fitful sleep 
 ProtagonistA sat up , heart pounding , and saw a large , furry creature standing in the clearing , looking at ProtagonistA with intelligent eyes 
 ProtagonistA froze , not knowing what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't stop running until ProtagonistA was safely inside , with the door bolted shut behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA never went back to that part of the woods again , but ProtagonistA always wondered what that creature had been 
 Was it a bear ? A wolf ? Or something else entirely ? ProtagonistA would never know for sure , but the experience had left ProtagonistA with a lifelong love of animals 
ProtagonistA had a rough day 
 ProtagonistA lost ProtagonistA's wallet on ProtagonistA's way to work and had to borrow money from ProtagonistA's co - workers just to make it through the day 
 ProtagonistA was really looking forward to getting home , but when ProtagonistA got to the bus stop , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA did n't have enough money for the fare 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA explained ProtagonistA's situation and ProtagonistB offered to give ProtagonistA a penny - a - penny lift home 
 ProtagonistA was so grateful and ProtagonistA promised to pay ProtagonistB back as soon as ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA was so thankful for ProtagonistB's help and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB's kindness 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB with all of ProtagonistA's heart 
ProtagonistA had left home for the first time when ProtagonistA was thirteen 
 ProtagonistA had been excited to finally be out on ProtagonistA's own and to have some adventures 
 But , ProtagonistA quickly found out that ProtagonistB was possessed 
 But , ProtagonistA soon realized that the possession had changed ProtagonistB and that ProtagonistB was now a danger to ProtagonistA and to others 
 ProtagonistA had to find a way to stop ProtagonistB and to save ProtagonistB from the possession 
ProtagonistA glared at ProtagonistB , vigorously stirring the bowl of frosting 
 ProtagonistA had the foul look of the psychotic 
 ProtagonistA would not let ProtagonistB take away ProtagonistA's happiness 
 ProtagonistA had always loved baking 
 ProtagonistA loved the way the batter came together , the way the cake rose in the oven , and the way the frosting turned out 
 ProtagonistA was always so proud of ProtagonistA's cakes 
 ProtagonistA had tried everything ProtagonistA could think of , but nothing worked 
 ProtagonistA had even asked ProtagonistB for help , but ProtagonistB had just laughed and told ProtagonistA to give up 
 But ProtagonistA was n't going to give up 
 ProtagonistA was going to find out what was wrong with ProtagonistA's cakes , and ProtagonistA was going to fix it 
 ProtagonistA jumped , and the bowl of frosting toppled over 
  ProtagonistA 've ruined ProtagonistB's cake!Bob 's face turned red with anger 
 ProtagonistA had had enough of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA picked up the bowl of frosting and threw it at ProtagonistB , hitting ProtagonistB square in the face 
 ProtagonistA had been living with ProtagonistA's father since then , and though ProtagonistA was grateful for the support , ProtagonistA found the house to be incredibly lonely without ProtagonistB's presence 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB's cooking , ProtagonistB's laughter , and ProtagonistB's warm hugs 
 ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistB's old armchair , looking at old photos of ProtagonistB and trying to hold back the tears , when ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door 
 ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and was surprised to see ProtagonistC , standing on the doorstep 
 ProtagonistA invited ProtagonistC in , and they sat down in the living room and talked 
After ProtagonistA was expelled from Hogwarts , ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA's life was over 
 ProtagonistA would never be as bright as ProtagonistA's father , and as bright as ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could be 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never find a place in the world where ProtagonistA belonged 
 But then ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 With ProtagonistB's help , ProtagonistA became an Auror , and ProtagonistA's mother became a million miles away 
 ProtagonistA was interested in the same things as ProtagonistA's brother and was happy to partake in any activities that ProtagonistA's brother enjoyed 
 ProtagonistA wanted to find ProtagonistA's own interests and hobbies , but no matter how hard ProtagonistA tried , ProtagonistA could n't seem to break away from ProtagonistA's brother 's shadow 
 With ProtagonistB's support , ProtagonistA was finally able to break free from ProtagonistA's brother 's influence and become ProtagonistA's own person 
ProtagonistA was back in the Kremlin , slinging hints at ProtagonistB and son while ProtagonistA sat in ProtagonistA's comfortable chair 
 ProtagonistA was undeterred 
 ProtagonistA continued to make suggestive comments , hoping to get a rise out of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA quickly gathered ProtagonistA's things and left , vowing never to return 
 ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's everything 
 The only fault on which ProtagonistA is minded is that ProtagonistA has not yet regained the capacity of an adult man , but for whom , owing to the inherent value of youth and to ProtagonistA's own congenital beauty , the balance of society naturally imposed on ProtagonistA a certain age of vigor and of mature intellectual development 
 ProtagonistA had no education and no job skills 
 ProtagonistA drifted from one place to another , living on the streets and doing odd jobs to get by 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA worked hard and soon learned all ProtagonistA needed to know to be a successful adult 
 ProtagonistB was like a father to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was grateful for all that ProtagonistB had done for ProtagonistA 
 Thanks to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was now a productive member of society 
ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head dismissively as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB drift into the station carriages 
 But ProtagonistA was n't going to help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had enough problems of ProtagonistA's own 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was suspicious of ProtagonistB because ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB was either a prostitute or an insane person 
 ProtagonistA did n't like either of them , so ProtagonistA walked away 
 But ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistB would never admit it 
 ProtagonistA had been living on the streets of London for years , and ProtagonistA knew how to take care of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was a good kid , despite ProtagonistB's circumstances , and ProtagonistA wanted to help ProtagonistB however ProtagonistA could 
 Tonight , ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB pickpocket a wealthy - looking woman on the street 
 ProtagonistA had been about to intervene , but then ProtagonistA saw the gleam in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB needed the money more than the woman did , and so ProtagonistA let ProtagonistB go 
 Now , as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB run away , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had made the right decision 
 And ProtagonistA knew that , given time , ProtagonistB would make it on the streets just like ProtagonistA had 
ProtagonistA had always loved the rain 
 As a child , ProtagonistA would run outside and dance in the rain , spinning and twirling until ProtagonistA was soaked through to the bone 
 ProtagonistA loved the feeling of the rain on ProtagonistA's skin , the way it made ProtagonistA's hair stick to ProtagonistA's forehead and ProtagonistA's clothes cling to ProtagonistA's body 
 Now , as an adult , ProtagonistA still loved the rain 
 But ProtagonistA no longer ran outside and danced in it 
 Instead , ProtagonistA sat by the window and watched as the raindrops fell , each one making a different pattern on the glass 
 It was a rainy Saturday afternoon in September , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA thinking about the house ProtagonistA had lived in when ProtagonistA was a child 
 ProtagonistA remembered the ghost house ProtagonistA had seen in the woods and the tall , lopsided tree ProtagonistA had dreamed of jumping from 
 ProtagonistA also remembered the moon floating in the sky on that rainy night so long ago 
 ProtagonistA sighed and stood up , stretching ProtagonistA's arms above ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA was about to go make ProtagonistA a cup of tea when ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door 
 ProtagonistA opened it to find ProtagonistB , standing on the doorstep with an umbrella 
 ProtagonistA smiled back and invited ProtagonistB inside 
 ProtagonistA was glad for the company on this rainy day 
ProtagonistA had no name , and no business of ProtagonistA's own , but ProtagonistA had been told many a great lie , and none of them made a hair 's breadth more certain 
 ProtagonistA had been told that ProtagonistA was special , that ProtagonistA was destined for greatness , that ProtagonistA was the chosen one 
 But ProtagonistA was just a man , and all men are destined to die 
 ProtagonistA had no name , but ProtagonistA had a purpose 
 ProtagonistA was going to find ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was going to make ProtagonistB pay 
ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had been in more wars than ProtagonistA could count and had seen more death than anyone should have to see 
 But , somehow , ProtagonistA always managed to come out alive 
 ProtagonistA had seen a lot of death , but the one that always stuck with ProtagonistA was the death of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA never forgave ProtagonistA for not being able to save ProtagonistB 
 After the war , ProtagonistA tried to put ProtagonistA's life back together 
 ProtagonistA got a job and got married 
 ProtagonistA had a family and was happy for a time 
 ProtagonistA would have nightmares and would wake up in a cold sweat 
 ProtagonistA should have saved ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a troublemaker , but ProtagonistB had always been there to help ProtagonistA out 
 ProtagonistA had gotten involved with some shady characters and ProtagonistB was worried ProtagonistA was going to get hurt 
 ProtagonistA finally agreed and ProtagonistB breathed a sigh of relief 
 ProtagonistA was more than happy to oblige and set to work immediately 
 ProtagonistA wrote a beautiful letter , full of kind words and compliments 
 ProtagonistA expressed ProtagonistA's hope that ProtagonistB was well and that they might meet again soon 
 ProtagonistA signed off with ProtagonistA's best wishes and love 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would be touched by ProtagonistA's letter and that it would make ProtagonistB's day 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the barn , looking out over the field where ProtagonistB had once settled cattle 
 ProtagonistA was doing ProtagonistA's best , but it was hard work 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistB and the good times they had had on the farm 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was doing what ProtagonistB would want ProtagonistA to do 
 ProtagonistA was keeping the farm going and making it successful 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the barn 
 ProtagonistA got up to investigate , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC in the barn 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to see a cow in the barn , but ProtagonistA was n't worried 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistC was harmless 
 ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistA's seat in the barn and continued to think about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had the farm , and ProtagonistA was proud to be able to continue ProtagonistB's legacy 
ProtagonistA had just sat down in ProtagonistA's study at Hogwarts when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB staring at ProtagonistA with a look of wonder and admiration 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what to make of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA strangely drawn to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but wonder what ProtagonistB was thinking 
 Was ProtagonistB admiring ProtagonistA's intelligence ? ProtagonistA's magical abilities ? Or was ProtagonistB simply amazed by the fact that ProtagonistA was a wizard?Whatever the reason , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel flattered by ProtagonistB's attention 
 ProtagonistA smiled at ProtagonistB and gave ProtagonistB a small nod of acknowledgement before returning to ProtagonistA's thoughts 
ProtagonistA was only six years old when ProtagonistB died in a car crash 
 ProtagonistA remembered it vividly 
 ProtagonistA remembered how ProtagonistB's body was mangled and twisted in the wreckage 
 ProtagonistA remembered how ProtagonistB screamed for help , but no one came 
 ProtagonistA remembered how ProtagonistB begged for ProtagonistA to save ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't 
 ProtagonistA was too young and too weak 
 All ProtagonistA could do was watch as ProtagonistB died 
 ProtagonistA was happy to oblige 
ProtagonistA was a skilled lover , and ProtagonistA knew exactly how to get ProtagonistB pregnant 
 So ProtagonistA seduced ProtagonistB , and got ProtagonistB pregnant 
 So ProtagonistA became a husband , and a father 
 And ProtagonistA hated every minute of it 
 But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to keep up the act , for the sake of ProtagonistA's child 
ProtagonistA was an old man when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been a doctor ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA had retired years ago 
 ProtagonistA decided to help ProtagonistB by giving ProtagonistB a place to stay when ProtagonistB was in town 
When ProtagonistA fell seriously ill , ProtagonistA , in the first months of the nineteenth century , had it in ProtagonistA to believe that ProtagonistA owed ProtagonistA's life to the kindness of an old teacher 
 When the old teacher died , ProtagonistA was so grateful that ProtagonistA decided to write a book about his life 
ProtagonistA was not an expert in the art of voyaging , or even in navigation , but ProtagonistA was , however , an expert in sea - craft ; and ProtagonistB , was the same man who had made the first voyage , and had already brought with ProtagonistB , in consequence of curiosity and for infinite profit , a great quantity of useful knowledge and valuable experience , among which ProtagonistB had acquired , in a short time , because ProtagonistB had been accustomed to keep the knowledge of distant places in ProtagonistB's head , and had believed that ProtagonistB was always to find some necessary article for ProtagonistB's use in some remote corner of the earth , which ProtagonistB had come upon without any knowledge whatever of the locality 
 ProtagonistA never really understood what ProtagonistB meant , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA did n't want to be like ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be ProtagonistA's own man , with ProtagonistA's own mind and ProtagonistA's own purpose 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could never be the man ProtagonistB wanted ProtagonistA to be , but ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA did n't want to be like ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA could have used that money to live a comfortable life , but ProtagonistA decided to use it to make a difference in the world 
 ProtagonistA started a foundation to help people who were in need , and ProtagonistA dedicated ProtagonistA's life to helping others 
ProtagonistA had been dealing with ProtagonistB for weeks , and ProtagonistA was getting tired of it 
 ProtagonistA had had enough 
 So , when ProtagonistA sat down to read from the Book of the Law , ProtagonistA did so with the intention of banishing ProtagonistB once and for all 
 ProtagonistA focused all of ProtagonistA's energy on the words on the page , and as ProtagonistA read , ProtagonistA could feel the power of the book flowing through ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA did n't back down 
 ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief 
 Finally , ProtagonistA was free from ProtagonistB's clutches 
 And ProtagonistA had the Book of the Law to thank for it 
ProtagonistA was always telling stories to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA would make up wild adventures about space and time , always holding out ProtagonistA's pinky index finger , which ProtagonistA dubbed  super - power  , to ProtagonistB 
 One day , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA's stories could be real 
 ProtagonistA thought for a moment and then agreed 
 But ProtagonistA was nowhere to be found 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's stories could come true !  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA set out for the farm at the end of the summer to take ProtagonistA's share of the stock ProtagonistA had bought with ProtagonistB's money , which , in the course of the last year , had increased to three millions of dollars , and which , at the time that Mr
 So ProtagonistA went with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had promised to give ProtagonistB a birthday party , and Dave had laid it all out for ProtagonistA 
 It was a perfect day , and ProtagonistA was so glad ProtagonistA could make ProtagonistB's birthday so special 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an oddball 
 ProtagonistA was never quite sure how old ProtagonistA was , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was old 
 ProtagonistA had lived in a certain house in the churchyard when ProtagonistA was six or seven , and ProtagonistA had been dead for quite some time now 
 ProtagonistA was curious to know what it was like to be dead 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a daredevil , and ProtagonistA was always up for a challenge 
 ProtagonistA died on a Tuesday 
 ProtagonistA had been out walking in the churchyard , and ProtagonistA slipped and fell on a gravestone 
 ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistA's head on the stone and died instantly 
 ProtagonistA looked down and saw ProtagonistA's dead body lying on the ground 
 ProtagonistA was a bit shocked at first , but ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA was dead 
 ProtagonistA woke up and sat up , and ProtagonistA was surprised to find that ProtagonistA was alive 
 ProtagonistA had experienced death , and ProtagonistA had come back to life 
 ProtagonistA was a changed man , and ProtagonistA had a new appreciation for life 
 From then on , ProtagonistA vowed to live each day to the fullest 
 It was a beautiful day outside , and ProtagonistA was excited to spend the day with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA could see the joy in ProtagonistB's eyes as ProtagonistB spoke , and it made ProtagonistA feel happy to know that ProtagonistA was able to share this experience with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA quickly got out ProtagonistA's fishing gear and set up ProtagonistA's station 
 It was the best day ProtagonistA had had in a long time , and ProtagonistA was grateful to have such a special connection with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life , but always felt there was something more out there for ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to take a walk and see what the world had to offer 
 ProtagonistA walked for miles and miles , until ProtagonistA came to a large city 
 ProtagonistA was amazed by the sights and sounds of the city , and decided to explore it further 
 ProtagonistA walked for hours , until ProtagonistA came to a large park 
 In the park , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on a bench 
 ProtagonistA went over to talk to ProtagonistB , and they hit it off immediately 
 ProtagonistA went home that night feeling excited about the possibilities that life had to offer 
ProtagonistA 's not even ProtagonistB's father anymore , ProtagonistA croaked 
 ProtagonistA had maybe a month , maybe less 
ProtagonistA made a small , relatively uncommitted appearance at the door of the former home of a dead woman , but ProtagonistA did not allow ProtagonistB to remain there 
 ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB there before , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was not welcome 
 ProtagonistA did not want to cause any trouble , but ProtagonistA could not allow ProtagonistB to stay 
ProtagonistA was an apprentice to ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA came to the Yard as a gentle visitor 
 ProtagonistA quickly learned the ropes and became a valuable member of the team 
 ProtagonistA stepped up and took charge , ensuring that the job was done right 
 ProtagonistA proved ProtagonistA to be a true leader , and the other members of the team respected ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was happy to learn from ProtagonistB and soon became an expert groundskeeper ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was fourteen years old and ProtagonistB was a cold , hard - working , lonely widow who had no business putting ProtagonistA into such a bizarre situation 
 ProtagonistA was looking forward to a summer of hanging out with ProtagonistA's friends and riding ProtagonistA's bike around the neighborhood 
 But ProtagonistB , ca n't someone else do it ? ProtagonistA do n't want to go to the city 
 So , with a heavy heart , ProtagonistA set off for the city 
 ProtagonistA had never been there before and ProtagonistA was feeling very nervous 
 ProtagonistA took the subway to Mr
 Johnson ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA mother sent ProtagonistA to deliver this package ,  ProtagonistA said , holding it out 
 ProtagonistA was starting to feel very sorry for ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA had never talked to anyone like ProtagonistC before and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA opening up to ProtagonistC 
 Before ProtagonistA knew it , ProtagonistA was telling ProtagonistC everything about ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA left ProtagonistC's apartment feeling much better than when ProtagonistA had arrived 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had just had a very special conversation with ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA would always cherish the time they had spent together 
ProtagonistA was down in the basement preparing to play ProtagonistA's music in a small VCR when ProtagonistB called ProtagonistA over 
 ProtagonistA had been looking forward to this all day and was not about to let anything stop ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA got to the top of the stairs , ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB screaming 
 ProtagonistA ran into the living room to find ProtagonistB being attacked by a large snake 
 ProtagonistA grabbed the snake and threw it out the window 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's garden , watching ProtagonistA's fowls , and ProtagonistA talked to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was very happy 
 ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB around and explained how ProtagonistA had built it up over the years 
 ProtagonistA was happy to answer them all 
 ProtagonistA was very proud of ProtagonistA's garden and loved to talk about it 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw a sign that said  ProtagonistA , is ProtagonistC the Son of ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA do n't know , but ProtagonistA 'm going to find out !  So ProtagonistA went into the church and asked the priest 
  ProtagonistA was disappointed , but ProtagonistA decided to ask ProtagonistC ProtagonistC 
  ProtagonistA was amazed and excited ! ProtagonistA went back down the mountain and told everyone what ProtagonistA had heard 
ProtagonistA had been looking forward to this day for months 
 ProtagonistA had finally saved up enough money to buy ProtagonistA's very own trunk of books 
 ProtagonistA woke up early that morning , eager to get to the bookstore 
 ProtagonistA stood in the garden , admiring the flowers and the bees buzzing around them 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and smiled 
 ProtagonistA arrived at the bookstore and walked in , trunk in hand 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and set ProtagonistA's trunk down with a thump 
 I'd like to buy this trunk of books , please ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 've been saving up for months ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and lugged the trunk out to the garden 
 ProtagonistA could n't wait to get started on ProtagonistA's new adventure 
ProtagonistA was an ugly boy , and ProtagonistA knew it , and ProtagonistA just wanted to be loved 
 ProtagonistA had never had a girlfriend , and ProtagonistA was starting to lose hope 
 ProtagonistA had tried everything ProtagonistA could think of to make ProtagonistA more attractive , but nothing seemed to work 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had found the love ProtagonistA had been looking for 
ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately 
 ProtagonistA had lost everything 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head , and ProtagonistB could see the pain in ProtagonistA's eyes 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day 
 First , ProtagonistA's alarm clock did n't go off , so ProtagonistA was late for work 
 As ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistA's house , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , perched atop a tree in ProtagonistA's yard 
 ProtagonistA had always been allergic to cats , but ProtagonistB was the worst 
 ProtagonistA was about to go inside and take a much - needed nap when ProtagonistA heard a splash 
 ProtagonistA looked over and saw ProtagonistB , struggling to swim in ProtagonistA's pool 
 ProtagonistA sighed and shook ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA had to do 
 ProtagonistA went over to the pool and grabbed a net 
 As ProtagonistA swished it around in the water , ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB meowing in terror 
 Finally , ProtagonistA was able to scoop ProtagonistB out of the pool 
 ProtagonistA put ProtagonistB down on the ground , and ProtagonistB ran away as fast as ProtagonistB could 
 ProtagonistA went inside , exhausted from ProtagonistA's day 
 As ProtagonistA lay in bed , ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB meowing outside ProtagonistA's window 
 But ProtagonistA was too tired to care 
 ProtagonistA had been playing with ProtagonistA's friends in the park when they found a dead bird 
 At first , ProtagonistA did n't want to do it , but ProtagonistA's friends convinced ProtagonistA 
 So ProtagonistA put the bird in ProtagonistA's backpack and went home 
 When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's room and took the bird out of ProtagonistA's backpack 
 ProtagonistA felt guilty as ProtagonistA looked at the bird 's lifeless body 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should n't have put the bird in ProtagonistA's backpack , but ProtagonistA's friends had convinced ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was a child of ProtagonistA's time , but like all true children of ProtagonistA's time ProtagonistB died when ProtagonistA was eight 
 ProtagonistA never really knew ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB deeply 
 ProtagonistA often wondered what ProtagonistA's life would have been like if ProtagonistB had lived 
 Would ProtagonistA have been a different person ? Would ProtagonistA have been happier ? ProtagonistA would never know 
ProtagonistA was crying hysterically 
  Yes , ProtagonistA wants ProtagonistA to kill ProtagonistA !  ProtagonistA cried 
  But ProtagonistA was adamant 
  No , ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA really wants ProtagonistA to kill ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA do n't know why , but ProtagonistA said it would be a ' favor 
  Yes , ProtagonistA is 
 Maybe ProtagonistA was right and ProtagonistA did want ProtagonistA to kill ProtagonistA 
 Today , however , ProtagonistA could tell something was bothering ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA gently asked ProtagonistB what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA listened patiently as ProtagonistB spoke , offering words of comfort and support 
 ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA could be there for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that , no matter what , ProtagonistB would always be the picture of calm and serenity 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's studio , working on a new painting , when ProtagonistA heard the doorbell ring 
 ProtagonistA smiled and peered into the frame to see what the matter was , but ProtagonistA soon realised that it was nothing more than a routine visit from ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was happy to oblige , and ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB a few names of some other painters whose work ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB might enjoy 
ProtagonistA was fresh out of college and ready to start ProtagonistA's career 
 ProtagonistA had been through a few interviews , but none of them had gone well 
 ProtagonistA was getting desperate 
 ProtagonistA had no money and no prospects 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw an ad for a job that sounded perfect for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA went to the interview and it went well 
 ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA had the job in the bag 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and went home 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do now 
 ProtagonistA was out of options 
  A plot , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB ,  is a plan or scheme , usually secret , to accomplish some desired end 
 ProtagonistA just have to have faith in ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistA 'll try 
  ProtagonistA 've been working on this project for months , and ProtagonistA finally have everything ProtagonistA need to make it happen 
 ProtagonistA had been working on a secret project for months , and it was finally coming together 
 ProtagonistA had been able to secure the funding and the resources ProtagonistA needed , and now all ProtagonistA needed was the green light from ProtagonistB 
 I'm going to present it to ProtagonistB tomorrow ,  ProtagonistA continued 
  And ProtagonistA think ProtagonistB 's going to go for it 
 ProtagonistA just know it 
 ProtagonistA was confident in ProtagonistA's project , and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would see the potential 
 ProtagonistA had put in the work and ProtagonistA was ready for it to pay off 
 The next day , ProtagonistA went into ProtagonistB's office and presented ProtagonistA's project 
 ProtagonistA was my best friend , and ProtagonistA was always up for a challenge 
 So when I told ProtagonistA about my plan to put ProtagonistA on the moon , ProtagonistA was all for it 
 ProtagonistA was a little apprehensive at first , but ProtagonistA soon got used to the idea 
 And when ProtagonistA stepped out of the spaceship , ProtagonistA was the first person to walk on the moon 
 ProtagonistA was up there for less than a minute when we heard ProtagonistA screaming 
 If only I had listened to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would be safe at home on Earth instead of being a lunatic on the moon 
ProtagonistA had not been awake for more than ten minutes when ProtagonistA was informed that there was ProtagonistB waiting for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a bit surprised , as ProtagonistA was not expecting any visitors 
 ProtagonistA got up and went to the living room , where ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB sitting on the couch 
ProtagonistA was a great wizard , and ProtagonistA owned ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB would spend hours talking about all sorts of things 
 One day , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA agreed and the two set off on their journey 
ProtagonistA was just finishing up a long and tiring day of harvesting apples in an orchard when ProtagonistB suddenly appeared before ProtagonistA 
 What is it , ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA had always known that ProtagonistC was a ruthless leader , but ProtagonistA had never thought that ProtagonistC would stoop so low as to kill an innocent man 
 We have to do something ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA thought for a moment 
 Then , ProtagonistA had an idea 
 We can warn ProtagonistD ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door and ProtagonistD answered 
 ProtagonistA quickly explained the situation and ProtagonistD nodded 
 With ProtagonistD's safety assured , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB turned to go back home 
 ProtagonistA knew that there was no escaping now 
 ProtagonistA could only hope that ProtagonistD would be safe 
ProtagonistA had been lying in bed for hours , thinking about the future 
 ProtagonistA had the idea of trying to kill ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had never been a violent person , but ProtagonistA was tired of living in fear 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being afraid to leave ProtagonistA's house , or even open ProtagonistA's windows 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being afraid to go to sleep at night , in case the gang came and killed ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's sleep 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and began to get dressed 
 ProtagonistA put on ProtagonistA's heaviest clothes , and ProtagonistA's strongest boots 
 ProtagonistA filled ProtagonistA's pockets with stones , and took a knife from the kitchen 
 ProtagonistA knew it would n't be enough to kill ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA had to try 
 ProtagonistA walked to the gang 's territory , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
 ProtagonistA had never been this close to them before 
 ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB , surrounded by ProtagonistB's gang members 
 ProtagonistA tried to dodge ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB was too fast 
 ProtagonistA says that ProtagonistA has heard many stories about ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA is sure that ProtagonistB is still alive and well , although ProtagonistA can not say for certain where ProtagonistB is currently living 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA got there , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to find a way out 
 ProtagonistA started to look around for a way out , but the only thing ProtagonistA could find was a door 
 ProtagonistA tried to open it , but it was locked 
 ProtagonistA started to feel panicky , but then ProtagonistA saw a key on the floor 
 ProtagonistA picked it up and tried it in the lock , and it worked 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and walked out into a beautiful garden 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB there , and ProtagonistB was holding a baby 
ProtagonistA was a young hero , and ProtagonistA knew it 
 ProtagonistA had always been a hero , ever since ProtagonistA was a little boy 
 And now , ProtagonistA was going to save the world 
 ProtagonistA was going to stop ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was going to do it all by ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was going to be the hero that everyone needed 
 ProtagonistA pulled the hood up over ProtagonistA's head and started to run 
 ProtagonistA had to get to ProtagonistB's lair before it was too late 
 ProtagonistA had to stop ProtagonistB before ProtagonistB could destroy the world 
 ProtagonistA was the only one who could do it 
 ProtagonistA ran as fast as ProtagonistA could , but ProtagonistA was too late 
 ProtagonistA collapsed to the ground , defeated 
 ProtagonistA had failed 
 ProtagonistA had failed everyone 
 But then , ProtagonistA heard a voice 
 But then , ProtagonistA got up 
 ProtagonistA was n't going to give up 
 ProtagonistA was going to stop ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was going to save the world 
 And ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA was the first man on Earth , and ProtagonistA was given the task of creating everything 
 ProtagonistA did a good job , but ProtagonistA was lonely 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB became ProtagonistA's wife 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB with all of ProtagonistA's heart , and ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA back just as much 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do or how to cope with the news 
 ProtagonistA was there for ProtagonistB's every step of the way , but it was hard to see ProtagonistB suffer 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost a part of ProtagonistA 
 But even though ProtagonistB was gone , ProtagonistA still felt ProtagonistB's love 
ProtagonistA looked down at the pile of dusty papers on the table and sighed 
  That 's not the problem with the world , is it ?  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA had been working at the library for years , and ProtagonistA had seen the world change 
 ProtagonistA missed the days when people valued knowledge and learning 
 ProtagonistA nodded 
ProtagonistA always wore ProtagonistA's hat in one hand and ProtagonistA's moustaches in the other 
 ProtagonistA was a bit of a dandy , and ProtagonistA knew it 
 But ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA looked damn good in that hat , and those moustaches made ProtagonistA feel like a million bucks 
 ProtagonistA 'd been growing them out for years , and they were finally starting to get some real length to them 
 ProtagonistA was proud of ProtagonistA's moustaches , and ProtagonistA was n't afraid to show them off 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking down the street , hat in one hand and moustaches in the other , when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but stare at ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA as ProtagonistB walked by 
 ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB walk away , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to talk to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA quickly put ProtagonistA's hat back on ProtagonistA's head and ran after ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA caught up to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA introduced ProtagonistA and asked ProtagonistB out on a date 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to make a good impression , so ProtagonistA went home and spent hours getting ready 
 ProtagonistA put on ProtagonistA's best clothes and made sure ProtagonistA's moustaches were styled perfectly 
 When the date came , ProtagonistA showed up at ProtagonistB's door looking like a million bucks 
 ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA 'd finally found ProtagonistB 
 From that day on , ProtagonistA always made sure to wear ProtagonistA's hat in one hand and ProtagonistA's moustaches in the other when ProtagonistA went out on a date with ProtagonistB 
When ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistB wanted to have you killed , ProtagonistA was n't exaggerating 
 However , just as ProtagonistB was about to say the incantation , ProtagonistA appeared and stopped ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been following ProtagonistB and had overheard ProtagonistB's plans 
 ProtagonistA fought ProtagonistB and won , saving your life in the process 
Dipping ProtagonistA's finger into the bottle of a tiny silver tumbler , ProtagonistA lifted it to ProtagonistA's lips 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes , savoring the taste of the whiskey 
 When ProtagonistA opened them again , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB watching ProtagonistA from across the room 
 ProtagonistA downed the rest of the whiskey and set the glass down on the table before making ProtagonistA's way over to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA woke up the next morning with a headache 
 ProtagonistA cursed ProtagonistA for drinking so much , but the night with ProtagonistB was worth it 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and stumbled to the bathroom , hoping that a shower would make ProtagonistA feel better 
 As ProtagonistA turned on the water , ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door 
 ProtagonistA wrapped a towel around ProtagonistA's waist and went to answer it 
 ProtagonistA signed for it and took the package inside 
 ProtagonistA opened it to find a bottle of whiskey and a note from ProtagonistB that said ,  For next time 
  ProtagonistA smiled and went to take a shower 
 ProtagonistA 's always spouting off about how ProtagonistA knows better than anyone else and how everyone else is just wrong 
 Well , one day ProtagonistA finally goes too far 
 ProtagonistA gets into an argument with ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB finally has enough 
 ProtagonistA ca n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA always thought ProtagonistA was the best and that ProtagonistA knew everything 
 Now ProtagonistA 's out of a job and ProtagonistA has to face the fact that ProtagonistA might not know everything after all 
ProtagonistA was a victim , not of malice , but of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was always a good person , always helping others and never expecting anything in return 
 ProtagonistA was just going about ProtagonistA's day , minding ProtagonistA's own business , when ProtagonistB intervened 
ProtagonistA had always wanted to be an emperor 
 Ever since ProtagonistA was a young boy , ProtagonistA had dreamed of ruling over a vast empire 
 ProtagonistA knew that this was ProtagonistA's chance to finally achieve ProtagonistA's dream 
 With the help of ProtagonistA's great - grandmother 's wealth , ProtagonistA was able to amass a large army and conquer many lands 
 As ProtagonistA's empire continued to grow , ProtagonistA became more and more confident in ProtagonistA's abilities as a ruler 
 ProtagonistA began to believe that there was nothing ProtagonistA could n't achieve 
 ProtagonistA became the emperor of a vast and powerful empire 
 And ProtagonistA ruled with wisdom and strength , making ProtagonistB proud 
ProtagonistA had been watching the flowers for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting bored 
 ProtagonistA got up to stretch ProtagonistA's legs , and when ProtagonistA turned back to the window , ProtagonistA saw something that made ProtagonistA's heart stop 
 ProtagonistA quickly called the police , and when they arrived , they found ProtagonistB had a gun 
Buckingham 's old - fashioned chair looked over ProtagonistA's shoulder as ProtagonistA looked over ProtagonistA's books 
 Now , ProtagonistA was the only one in the family who was tall enough to sit in it 
 ProtagonistA loved the chair , and ProtagonistA loved the way it made ProtagonistA feel 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was a part of something larger than ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that the chair would be there for ProtagonistA , no matter what happened 
ProtagonistA was wearing the black trousers of a captain , a white shirt and a black blouse , with a red sash , and ProtagonistA's hair had been pulled back into a beautiful bun 
 ProtagonistA was the most handsome man that ProtagonistB had ever seen 
 ProtagonistA was so perfect 
 And ProtagonistA was looking at ProtagonistB with such intensity 
 ProtagonistA walked over to ProtagonistB and took ProtagonistB's hand 
  ProtagonistA 'm Bob ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA was so tall and strong 
 I know ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 've been watching ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 've been waiting for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA know it 's sudden , but ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA ca n't do this without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB to be ProtagonistA's wife 
The day that ProtagonistA disobeyed ProtagonistB's wishes , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would be in for it 
 As ProtagonistA approached the house , ProtagonistA could feel an eerie presence 
 ProtagonistA tried to shake the feeling and entered the house 
 Once inside , ProtagonistA immediately regretted ProtagonistA's decision 
 ProtagonistA could feel the hair on the back of ProtagonistA's neck stand up , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to get out of there 
 ProtagonistA turned to make ProtagonistA's escape , but ProtagonistA was frozen in place 
 ProtagonistA could n't move 
 ProtagonistA tried to scream , but no sound would come out 
ProtagonistA was a very pretty girl , far too pretty for ProtagonistA's age 
 ProtagonistA had the perfect look for it , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could make it if ProtagonistA just had the chance 
 One day , ProtagonistA got that chance 
 ProtagonistA started modeling and was a huge success 
 ProtagonistA loved the fast paced lifestyle and the attention ProtagonistA was getting 
 ProtagonistA was making more money than ProtagonistA ever could have dreamed of 
 But as the years went by , ProtagonistA started to feel empty inside 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's small town and the simple life 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was chasing the wrong dream 
 ProtagonistA quit modeling , moved back to ProtagonistA's small town , and started living a more authentic life 
 And ProtagonistA was finally happy 
 ProtagonistA had seen a world that was not ProtagonistA's own , a world that was filled with strange creatures and even stranger people 
 ProtagonistA had seen a city that was in the grip of a dark power , a power that seemed to be corrupting everything it touched 
 And ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was driving along the street when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what ProtagonistB meant , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was right 
 ProtagonistA had been searching for something ProtagonistA's whole life , but ProtagonistA had never been able to put ProtagonistA's finger on what it was 
 ProtagonistA did n't hesitate 
 ProtagonistA had a feeling that ProtagonistB was going to change ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA did as ProtagonistA was told , and soon ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful house by the sea 
 It 's a weight that ProtagonistA 's been carrying around for far too long and ProtagonistA 's finally ready to let it go 
 ProtagonistA 's nervous , but ProtagonistA 's also excited 
 ProtagonistA meets ProtagonistB at a party and they hit it off immediately 
 ProtagonistA is about to finally lose ProtagonistA's virginity 
 when ProtagonistA suddenly realizes that ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's wallet at the party 
 ProtagonistA 's not ready to lose ProtagonistA's virginity just yet 
 ProtagonistA still has ProtagonistA's wallet when ProtagonistA gets home , but ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA 's not ready to give up ProtagonistA's virginity just yet 
 ProtagonistA 's glad that ProtagonistA did n't go through with it , but ProtagonistA also knows that ProtagonistA 'll be ready soon 
 ProtagonistA just has to find the right person 
ProtagonistA had never been one for commitment 
 ProtagonistA liked ProtagonistA's freedom and ProtagonistA liked ProtagonistA's space 
 So when ProtagonistA inherited ProtagonistA's uncle 's estate , ProtagonistA was not planning to marry , not until ProtagonistA had had ProtagonistA's fill of the immaculate manse 
 But then ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 Slowly but surely , ProtagonistA began to fall in love with ProtagonistB 
 And before ProtagonistA knew it , ProtagonistA was planning to marry ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be the perfect wife for ProtagonistA and that together they could make a life that was full of love and happiness 
 ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's best friend , and they were always together 
 ProtagonistA vowed to find ProtagonistC and make ProtagonistC pay 
 But ProtagonistA never could 
 But ProtagonistA always suspected that ProtagonistC was still out there , somewhere 
 And ProtagonistA was right 
 ProtagonistA had a gun and ProtagonistA shot ProtagonistC 
 And then ProtagonistA wept , for ProtagonistB and for ProtagonistA 
To this day , ProtagonistA has to deal with the fact that ProtagonistB , had a heart of stone 
 ProtagonistA was only six years old at the time , but ProtagonistA remembers ProtagonistB vividly 
 ProtagonistA has never forgiven ProtagonistB for that 
ProtagonistA prayed for a solution but nothing came to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been struggling with ProtagonistA's faith for a while and had been questioning whether ProtagonistC was real 
 ProtagonistA had tried everything ProtagonistA could think of to find an answer , but nothing had worked 
 ProtagonistA was starting to lose hope 
 One night , ProtagonistA had a dream 
 In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA felt different 
 ProtagonistA knew that what ProtagonistA had seen was real and that ProtagonistA needed to keep faith 
 ProtagonistA started to pray again and this time , ProtagonistA felt a peace come over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would find the answers ProtagonistA was looking for 
 ProtagonistA was a bit nervous , as ProtagonistA had never done anything like this before , but ProtagonistA was also excited to be doing something new 
 As the conversation flowed around ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA relaxing and enjoying ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA laughed at the jokes , and added ProtagonistA's own comments when ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to find that ProtagonistA actually had a lot to say , and that ProtagonistA was really enjoying ProtagonistA 
 When it was time to go , ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for inviting ProtagonistA , and said that ProtagonistA had had a wonderful time 
 ProtagonistA was already looking forward to the next coffee - table conversation , and to getting to know the other people in the group better 
 ProtagonistA was two years older than ProtagonistB , and was very different from ProtagonistB in character 
 ProtagonistA was wild and reckless , and always getting into mischief ; but ProtagonistA was good - hearted , and had a soft spot for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA used to tease ProtagonistB and make fun of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA always did it in a good - natured way , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was only joking 
ProtagonistA had been drinking with ProtagonistA's husband and ProtagonistB at a little inn in a certain town in the United States at the time when the great tempo of American industry was at an end 
 ProtagonistA had been trying to keep ProtagonistB from drinking , but ProtagonistB had insisted on it 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA was just tired and wanted to go to bed 
ProtagonistA was sitting at ProtagonistA's dining room table in the picture room , watching with some interest as the door of ProtagonistA's second class compartment was pushed open 
 It is ,  ProtagonistA said 
  But ProtagonistA do n't mind if ProtagonistB join ProtagonistA 
 I'm Bob ,  ProtagonistA said , extending ProtagonistA's hand 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA attracted to ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was interested in ProtagonistA as well 
Every Sunday , Father 's Day , ProtagonistA , had the usual Sunday breakfast 
 ProtagonistA was a widower , and ProtagonistA's children were all married and living away from home 
 ProtagonistA always looked forward to Sunday breakfast 
 When ProtagonistA arrived at ProtagonistB's house , ProtagonistA could tell something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA soon found out what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA could not imagine ProtagonistA's life without ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to be strong for ProtagonistA's grandchildren 
ProtagonistA was walking to the door of ProtagonistB's cabin when ProtagonistA heard the birds chirping 
 ProtagonistA sat down and told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's day , and ProtagonistB listened attentively 
 ProtagonistA loved hearing stories about ProtagonistB's adventures , and ProtagonistA was always eager to hear more 
ProtagonistA went to bed in the morning , early , thinking of the presents ProtagonistA would be leaving ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had wrapped them all up nicely and placed them under the tree 
 ProtagonistB would be so surprised ! ProtagonistA could n't wait to see the look on ProtagonistB's face when ProtagonistB opened them 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA had gotten ProtagonistB the perfect gifts 
ProtagonistA was lying on the floor on ProtagonistA's back , rocking back and forth , stretching out ProtagonistA's heels in the air 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a pair of old , faded jeans and a white t - shirt 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and turned away from ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA could n't bring ProtagonistA to speak 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had failed ProtagonistB somehow 
 ProtagonistA , please tell ProtagonistB what 's wrong ,  ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistB's voice filled with concern 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and finally spoke 
  ProtagonistA failed the test ,  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's voice trembling 
 ProtagonistA nodded and leaned into ProtagonistB's embrace 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was right 
ProtagonistA was nine years old when ProtagonistA first heard of the death of ProtagonistC 
 It was a cold winter day and ProtagonistA was inside playing with ProtagonistA's toys 
 ProtagonistA could tell by the look on ProtagonistB's face that something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA did n't understand what that meant at first , but ProtagonistA soon realized that ProtagonistC was never coming home 
 ProtagonistA was sad for a long time after that 
ProtagonistA was a fine , cheerful , cheerful girl of fifteen years of age , who had a cheerful manner , and good sense , but no very good sense ; and though ProtagonistA was wo nt to be a good - humoured and a happy - go - lucky girl , ProtagonistA was not without a certain air of melancholy 
 ProtagonistA had never been able to please ProtagonistA's stepfather , who was a stern , hard man , and ProtagonistA had grown to hate the work in the factory 
 ProtagonistA followed close behind , ProtagonistB clinging to ProtagonistA tightly 
 What happened ?  ProtagonistA asked 
ProtagonistA sat down in the heather green armchair in ProtagonistA's little office and talked 
  ProtagonistA 'm so tired of all this ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA just want to retire and live in peace 
  But ProtagonistA ca n't just leave ProtagonistA's job 
 ProtagonistA have to finish what ProtagonistA started 
  ProtagonistA sighed and nodded 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was right 
 But ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like ProtagonistA was already retired , living in a world of ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA was like a sister to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was the one who made sure ProtagonistB had food and shelter 
 ProtagonistA was the one who made sure ProtagonistB went to school and got an education 
 ProtagonistA was the one who made sure ProtagonistB had a job and was able to support ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was the one who was always there for ProtagonistB , no matter what 
 ProtagonistA was going through a tough time and ProtagonistB wanted to be there for ProtagonistA , just like ProtagonistA had been there for ProtagonistB all those years ago 
ProtagonistA had always been a happy - go - lucky guy 
 ProtagonistA was always smiling and joking around 
 ProtagonistA was out walking ProtagonistC when ProtagonistA saw a group of kids playing in the park 
 ProtagonistA went over to see what was wrong and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC had run away 
 ProtagonistA helped ProtagonistB look for ProtagonistC , but they could n't find ProtagonistC anywhere 
 ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistB was so happy and ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistA 
 But after that day , ProtagonistA was never the same 
 ProtagonistA was always looking for lost dogs and helping people find them 
 ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's calling 
 ProtagonistA was amazed , and ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's time 
One day , when ProtagonistA was about twelve years old , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were riding in the back of a coach through the suburbs of New York 
 As they rode , ProtagonistA looked out the window and saw a group of boys playing ball in a park 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could be out there with them , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA saw that the coach 's wheel had come off 
 ProtagonistA waited outside with ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was disappointed , but ProtagonistA knew there was nothing ProtagonistA could do 
The last time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a man 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a man who was content with ProtagonistB's life , and ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB 
The first time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB dead , ProtagonistA felt the dread of death wash over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was gone , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a sense of dread 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to die too 
ProtagonistA was walking home from work when ProtagonistA heard the cold wind howling 
 ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , but the wind seemed to be following ProtagonistA 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB in the distance 
 ProtagonistA felt a cold chill run down ProtagonistA's spine and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was in danger 
 ProtagonistA tried to resist , but ProtagonistA could n't 
 ProtagonistA was sweating profusely and ProtagonistA's grip on the mans hand was slipping 
 ProtagonistA gratefully accepted and ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA to a nearby bench where ProtagonistA could sit and rest 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC were sitting in the parlor discussing the recent death of ProtagonistB 
 However , ProtagonistA was also very saddened by the death of ProtagonistB and was still in mourning 
 ProtagonistA was completely devoted to ProtagonistA's husband 
 At first , ProtagonistA was hesitant , but ProtagonistA eventually relented 
 As soon as ProtagonistA walked into the bar , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart racing as ProtagonistC talked to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could feel a stirring in ProtagonistA's loins 
 Before ProtagonistA knew it , ProtagonistA was following ProtagonistC back to ProtagonistC's place 
 In the morning , ProtagonistA snuck out , feeling guilty about what ProtagonistA had done 
 However , ProtagonistA could n't deny that ProtagonistA had enjoyed it immensely 
 From then on , ProtagonistA started going to the gay bar more and more , always hoping to run into ProtagonistC again 
One day in August , a winter in the West , ProtagonistA came to a village to pick up ProtagonistB 
 They spent the day together catching up and ProtagonistA was happy to finally be able to hold ProtagonistB again 
ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistB's head , and down at ProtagonistB's feet , and said ,  ProtagonistB 'll be ProtagonistB's companion 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would have to take care of ProtagonistB soon 
ProtagonistA had been on the ship for weeks , and was excited to finally be nearing their destination 
 ProtagonistA had been looking forward to seeing ProtagonistA's family again and could n't wait to get off the ship 
 However , just a few miles from the bridge that would take them to safety , ProtagonistA became ill with cholera 
 ProtagonistA died within a few days , alone and scared 
 ProtagonistA never got to see ProtagonistA's family again or experience the life ProtagonistA had been dreaming of 
One morning in October , 1890 , ProtagonistA came to the friend - house in the street called Beechmere Lane , with the sign over ProtagonistA's door :  B
  ProtagonistA had been working for ProtagonistB for nearly two years , and was a good workman 
 But this morning ProtagonistA looked worried and anxious 
 ProtagonistA ca n't afford to pay for it , and ProtagonistA do n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA can go home and look after ProtagonistC 
  Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA had been a happy baby , with a smile that could light up a room , and eyes that sparkled with mischief 
 As ProtagonistA grew , ProtagonistA continued to charm everyone ProtagonistA met 
 ProtagonistA was always the life and soul of the party , and ProtagonistA's infectious laughter was impossible to resist 
 ProtagonistA had a heart of gold , and was always ready to help anyone in need 
 ProtagonistA was also fiercely loyal to ProtagonistA's family and friends , and would do anything to protect them 
 ProtagonistA threw ProtagonistA into ProtagonistA's studies , determined to make ProtagonistB proud 
 ProtagonistA quickly became one of the top students in ProtagonistA's class , and was offered a place at the prestigious Port Omega Academy 
 ProtagonistA worked hard at ProtagonistA's studies , and was soon one of the most promising students at the academy 
 ProtagonistA had a bright future ahead of ProtagonistA , and was destined to make ProtagonistA's mark on the world 
ProtagonistA had been drinking with ProtagonistB all evening , and ProtagonistA had been told to go to bed early , for ProtagonistA was going to spend all night with ProtagonistB 
 However , ProtagonistA did n't want to go to bed , for ProtagonistA wanted to stay up and drink with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA went to bed , but ProtagonistA was so angry with ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA did n't want to talk to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that this was ProtagonistA's duty , that ProtagonistA was required to marry and produce an heir , but ProtagonistA had never expected to be married to a man 
 Now , as ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA could see the same fear in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 It was clear that ProtagonistB was just as unwilling as ProtagonistA was , but there was no turning back now 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to be sick , but ProtagonistA managed to keep ProtagonistA together until the end 
 ProtagonistA could barely look at ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA could tell that the feeling was mutual 
 ProtagonistA had never felt so alone , and ProtagonistA knew that this was only the beginning 
ProtagonistA was having a tough day 
 Then , ProtagonistA got into a fight with ProtagonistA's best friend 
 ProtagonistA was so angry , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA's head was going to explode 
 ProtagonistA was so angry , ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB was sorry 
ProtagonistA was a great speaker 
 ProtagonistA had a way with words that could make even the most boring topics interesting 
ProtagonistA was increasing in stature 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful , cat - faced creature , but most people would admit that ProtagonistA was rather strange 
 ProtagonistA did n't seem to understand human emotions and often acted more like a cat than a person 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB became friends , and they would often spend time together , just talking and enjoying each other 's company 
ProtagonistA was walking through the great halls of the castle at the summit of a vast and summaing mount , when ProtagonistA came face to face with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was very old and very tired 
 ProtagonistA was shocked , but ProtagonistA agreed to do it 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's knife and stabbed ProtagonistB in the heart 
On the night of the triumph of God , when the clouds of the tempest were in their most profuse motion , ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's womb , and bearing a son , whose name was John , uttered a pious prayer to ProtagonistB ; and said ,  Gentlemen , according to the divine will , ProtagonistA am now at liberty to choose the mode which most properly belongs to ProtagonistA ; in which , according to your minds and ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA shall be able to establish ProtagonistA's religion ; and for this purpose ProtagonistA beg leave to make ascertainment of the manner in which ProtagonistA shall assemble ProtagonistA's companions in this city 
  Having made this request , ProtagonistA then withdrew ; and it was not long before ProtagonistA returned , attended by a great number of persons , who were all clothed in white , and had their heads covered with crowns of thorns 
 These ProtagonistA conducted to the place where ProtagonistB was , and said to ProtagonistB ,  Behold , ProtagonistB , the religion which ProtagonistA have chosen , and which ProtagonistA believe to be the true one ; and these are ProtagonistA's companions , who , like ProtagonistA , are ready to suffer death for its sake 
 ProtagonistA replied ,  ProtagonistA am not led to believe this by any arguments which ProtagonistA can offer ; but by a certain inward feeling , which tells ProtagonistA that it is the true religion , and which is confirmed by the miracles which have been wrought in its favour 
 ProtagonistA had been away at sea and had only recently returned 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's adventures at sea and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life as a wife and mother 
ProtagonistA had been in ProtagonistA's cell for two days now 
 ProtagonistA was innocent , but no one believed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had given up hope 
 ProtagonistA could n't bear to get out of bed and face another day in this place 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to lay there and die 
 ProtagonistA sat up , expecting to see the guard 
 Instead , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was or what ProtagonistB was doing here 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was going to spend the rest of ProtagonistA's life in prison , but ProtagonistB was giving ProtagonistA hope 
 With ProtagonistB's help , ProtagonistA was able to escape from prison 
 ProtagonistA was finally free 
 By this , ProtagonistA meant the act of speaking to the dead , and they would answer 
 It was a power ProtagonistA had discovered ProtagonistA had when ProtagonistA was just a child 
 When ProtagonistA's parents died in a car accident , ProtagonistA had gone to their graves and spoken to them 
 Now , as an adult , ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA in a situation where ProtagonistA could use ProtagonistA's power to help others 
 ProtagonistA was able to help ProtagonistB , and it was an incredibly moving experience for both of them 
 Since then , ProtagonistA had helped many people to contact their loved ones who had passed away 
 It was a gift that ProtagonistA was able to give , and ProtagonistA was grateful for it 
 ProtagonistA had two brothers and two sisters , and they all loved each other very much 
 ProtagonistA was a happy child , and ProtagonistA loved to play by the sea 
 ProtagonistA would build sandcastles , and then ProtagonistA would run to the waves and jump in , splashing everyone around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was always laughing and joking , and everyone loved ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's brothers and sisters all helped ProtagonistB , and they managed to get by 
 When ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA left home and went to London to find work 
 ProtagonistA found a job in a factory , and ProtagonistA worked there for many years 
 ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC , and they fell in love and got married 
 ProtagonistA was happy in London , but ProtagonistA always missed ProtagonistA's home by the sea 
 ProtagonistA would go back there for holidays , and ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistA's children to play by the waves 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA's children 
 ProtagonistA continued to work in the factory , and ProtagonistA continued to take ProtagonistA's children back to the sea for holidays 
 And every time they did , ProtagonistA would remember the happy times ProtagonistA had with ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistA would know that , even though ProtagonistC was gone , ProtagonistC was still with ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's heart 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's job as a janitor at the local elementary school , and ProtagonistA did n't mind that people thought ProtagonistA was a little slow 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled to have a chance to show what ProtagonistA was really capable of 
 ProtagonistA worked hard all week , and by the end of the week , ProtagonistA had shown that ProtagonistA was just as smart as anyone else 
 ProtagonistA knew all the students ' names , and ProtagonistA was able to answer all the parents ' questions 
 ProtagonistA was always ready to help out anyone who needed it , and ProtagonistA was always eager to learn new things 
 ProtagonistA even went back to school to get ProtagonistA's GED , and ProtagonistA eventually went to college 
 ProtagonistA proved to everyone that ProtagonistA was not dumb , and that ProtagonistA could accomplish anything ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the veranda of the front door with ProtagonistA's hands on the knob 
 ProtagonistA was about to go inside when ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA got up and walked around the side of the house 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on the ground with ProtagonistB's head in ProtagonistB's hands 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA felt sorry for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA sat down and talked to ProtagonistB for a while 
 Then ProtagonistA went inside and got ProtagonistB a glass of water 
 ProtagonistA sat with ProtagonistB until ProtagonistB felt better 
 ProtagonistA was awaiting the publication of ProtagonistA's work , which was entitled A History of the World 
 ProtagonistA determined to devote to the study of it all that was worthy of ProtagonistA's mind and to the satisfaction of the human race 
 ProtagonistA began to explain ProtagonistA's work to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA quickly realized that it was too complex for ProtagonistB to understand 
 ProtagonistA decided to simplify it for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA's work was a history of the world , but from a different perspective 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had studied the history of the world from the perspective of the people who had lived in it 
 ProtagonistA had tried to understand their experiences and their points of view 
 ProtagonistA had also tried to understand the forces that had shaped their lives 
 ProtagonistA was happy to oblige 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the different periods of history that ProtagonistA had studied and the different people that ProtagonistA had written about 
 ProtagonistA also told ProtagonistB about the different ways that people had tried to make sense of the world 
ProtagonistA sits cross - legged on the floor of the dark alcove , ProtagonistA's fingers tracing the lines of a small painting 
 ProtagonistA does n't know who ProtagonistB is , but ProtagonistA feels drawn to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA ca n't explain it , but ProtagonistA feels a deep connection to it 
 Please , ProtagonistA begs , let ProtagonistA find ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA does n't know what ProtagonistA 'll do if ProtagonistA finds ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA has to try 
 ProtagonistA does n't know how long ProtagonistA sits there , but eventually ProtagonistA gets to ProtagonistA's feet and starts to search for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA does n't know ProtagonistB's name , but ProtagonistA 's sure ProtagonistA 'll know ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA sees ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA does n't know where to start , but ProtagonistA 's sure ProtagonistA 'll find ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA just does n't seem to enjoy ProtagonistA's things the way ProtagonistB do 
ProtagonistA had been preparing for this day for months 
 ProtagonistA had polished ProtagonistA's boots , brushed ProtagonistA's clothes , and made sure everything was perfect 
 ProtagonistA was going to meet the family of ProtagonistB 
 As ProtagonistA waited for ProtagonistB to arrive , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a bit nervous 
 ProtagonistA had never met someone so important before 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would remember ProtagonistA fondly , and ProtagonistA would always be welcome in the Province 
 ProtagonistA had been fighting for ProtagonistA's life for what seemed like hours , and ProtagonistA was exhausted 
 ProtagonistA lunged forward and grabbed the cloak , yanking it out of ProtagonistB's hands 
 ProtagonistA grabbed ProtagonistB by the arm and pulled ProtagonistB to safety 
 ProtagonistA had saved ProtagonistB's life 
ProtagonistA had been thinking all night and ProtagonistA 'd been stumped ever since 
 ProtagonistA just could n't figure out what to get ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's birthday 
 ProtagonistA racked ProtagonistA's brain for ideas , but nothing came to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was starting to get desperate 
 ProtagonistA thought about what ProtagonistB liked and what ProtagonistB did n't like 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB loved being outdoors , so ProtagonistA thought about getting ProtagonistB something that would help ProtagonistB enjoy it even more 
 ProtagonistA considered a new bike or a kayak , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistB would use them enough to justify the cost 
 ProtagonistA was running out of time and ProtagonistA still did n't have a gift 
 Finally , ProtagonistA decided to just ask ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB wanted 
 ProtagonistA knew it was n't the most romantic option , but it was better than getting ProtagonistB's nothing 
 ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would make more time for ProtagonistB and that they would have many more happy years together 
ProtagonistA was out for a walk in the woods when ProtagonistA came across a bush 
 ProtagonistA had never seen ProtagonistB before , and ProtagonistA was n't sure whether ProtagonistA had ever seen ProtagonistB before 
 ProtagonistA was confused , but ProtagonistA decided to follow ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB to a clearing in the woods , where ProtagonistB stopped and turned to face ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistB could know about ProtagonistA's quest , but ProtagonistA was intrigued 
 ProtagonistA agreed to let ProtagonistB help ProtagonistA , and together they set off into the woods , looking for the lost city of Atlantis 
ProtagonistA was in a large room on the first floor of ProtagonistA's house 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have ProtagonistB close by 
ProtagonistA had already been through the worst stages of ProtagonistA's career , when ProtagonistA unexpectedly found ProtagonistA alone and facing the ultimatum of exposing the real source of the calamity ProtagonistA was in 
 ProtagonistA was only twenty - two , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do something to save ProtagonistA and others from the same fate 
 ProtagonistA exposed ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was brought to justice 
ProtagonistA was always a tall girl , even when ProtagonistA was just six years old 
 ProtagonistA towered over ProtagonistA's classmates and always felt a bit out of place 
 But ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's height and never felt self - conscious about it 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was out playing with ProtagonistA's friends , ProtagonistA ran into ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was amazed and asked ProtagonistB how ProtagonistB got so tall 
 ProtagonistA was amazed 
 ProtagonistA had always thought ProtagonistA was the only tall girl in the world 
 But now ProtagonistA knew that there were others like ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was happy to have found someone who understood ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was walking through town on the left hand side of the road when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so confused and did n't know what to think 
 ProtagonistA just stood there and stared at ProtagonistB until ProtagonistB finally noticed ProtagonistA and gave ProtagonistA an awkward smile 
 ProtagonistA quickly turned away and continued on ProtagonistA's way , ProtagonistA's mind racing with questions 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider 
 ProtagonistA was the only one of ProtagonistA's kind 
 ProtagonistA was a total of sixty - four people , and no one knew quite what ProtagonistB was 
 But ProtagonistA was different 
 ProtagonistA was smart 
 ProtagonistA was a million times as smart as anybody else 
 And ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew how to get into the place , and how to start 
 ProtagonistA was the only one who knew 
 And ProtagonistA was going to use that knowledge to take over the world 
ProtagonistA was sitting at the table , listening to the conversation around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was in the most northeasterly part of Maine and it was the summer solstice 
 ProtagonistA heard two men talking about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA decided ProtagonistA would go look for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had nothing better to do and ProtagonistA liked the idea of exploring the woods 
 ProtagonistA told the men ProtagonistA would go look for ProtagonistB and they gave ProtagonistA directions to where ProtagonistB was last seen 
 ProtagonistA set off into the woods , following the directions the men had given ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA searched for ProtagonistB all day but ProtagonistA could n't find ProtagonistB 
 It was getting dark and ProtagonistA was getting tired 
 ProtagonistA decided to go back to the men and tell them ProtagonistA could n't find ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistA's table and sat down 
 ProtagonistA was tired but ProtagonistA felt good knowing ProtagonistA had tried to help ProtagonistB 
When ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's seventies , ProtagonistA was walking ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had lived a long and interesting life , and ProtagonistA loved to share ProtagonistA's stories with ProtagonistB 
 One day , as they were walking , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC walking towards them 
 As ProtagonistC got closer , ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistC was carrying a gun 
 ProtagonistA reached into ProtagonistA's pocket and pulled out ProtagonistA's wallet 
 ProtagonistA handed it to ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistC took it and ran away 
 ProtagonistA walked home with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB what had happened 
 ProtagonistA did n't tell anyone else about the robbery 
 ProtagonistA was embarrassed and ProtagonistA did n't want to make a fuss 
 But ProtagonistA always remembered it , and ProtagonistA always thought about what could have happened 
ProtagonistA had always looked up to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was everything that ProtagonistA was n't : outgoing , popular , and smart 
 So when ProtagonistA saw the statue of ProtagonistB with their father , ascending the balustrade at Westminster , ProtagonistA felt dismayed and intellectually disgraced 
ProtagonistA , with ProtagonistC , at ProtagonistA's side , rode out into the great wide plain of Phlegethon , where ProtagonistA found the rest of ProtagonistA's family in the company of Mrs
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistC that ProtagonistA had not , but that ProtagonistA had heard tell of them , and that they were said to be very fierce creatures 
 ProtagonistA did not think that this was a good idea , but ProtagonistD said that it would be quite safe , and that ProtagonistD would go with them 
 So , ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistD set out on their quest to find a dragon 
 ProtagonistA called out to the dragon , and it slowly opened its eyes 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistD quickly grabbed ProtagonistC and ran out of the cave , with the dragon close behind them 
 ProtagonistA will tell you how it came to pass , said ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA stammered : ProtagonistB had been ill for some time and the king had been by ProtagonistB's side day and night 
ProtagonistA was a man who enjoyed the art of murdering 
 ProtagonistA was a cold - blooded killer who took pleasure in ending the lives of others 
 ProtagonistA was a skilled killer who was never caught by the authorities 
 ProtagonistA always managed to make ProtagonistA's victims look like they had died of natural causes 
 ProtagonistA had many victims over the years 
 ProtagonistA then went on to kill several more women who ProtagonistA met in similar circumstances 
 ProtagonistA was a sociopath who did n't care about anyone but ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC 
 They began dating and ProtagonistA even began to think about settling down with ProtagonistC 
 However , ProtagonistA could n't shake ProtagonistA's murderous ways and eventually killed ProtagonistC too 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA would never be able to change and that ProtagonistA was doomed to a life of killing 
ProtagonistA had been driving a truck for years , and ProtagonistA had seen a lot of different people on the road 
 ProtagonistA always made it a point to be friendly to everyone , because ProtagonistA never knew when ProtagonistA might need a friend on the road 
 One day , ProtagonistA was sitting in a truck stop , having a cup of coffee and talking to some of the other drivers 
 ProtagonistA got to talking to ProtagonistB , and they began to talk about what they would do if they won the lottery 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA would buy a truck stop , so that ProtagonistA could help other drivers like ProtagonistA 
 A few weeks later , ProtagonistA won the lottery 
 And , true to ProtagonistA's word , ProtagonistA bought a truck stop 
 ProtagonistA was able to help a lot of other drivers , and ProtagonistA made a lot of new friends 
ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer 
 As a child , ProtagonistA would lay in bed at night and stare up at the stars , dreaming of the adventures ProtagonistA would one day go on 
 But ProtagonistA never gave up on ProtagonistA's dreams 
 ProtagonistA continued to chase after them , even when everyone around ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA to give up 
 And then one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 Encouraged by ProtagonistB's interest , ProtagonistA took a risk and shared ProtagonistA's greatest dream with ProtagonistB 
 And so ProtagonistA took a deep breath and drank to the full 
 ProtagonistA let ProtagonistA dream and hope and wish for the impossible 
 ProtagonistA never really believed ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB and so ProtagonistA went along with it 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistC was so insistent that ProtagonistA finally agreed 
ProtagonistA had been shopping online for a new TV for weeks

 ProtagonistA was getting angry 
ProtagonistA rose early that morning , lifting ProtagonistA's ten - pound hammer from the table before he and pounding the ground 
 ProtagonistA had been working on this house for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to see some progress 
 ProtagonistA worked tirelessly , hammering in nails and sawing boards 
 ProtagonistA was so focused on ProtagonistA's work that ProtagonistA did n't hear the car pull up behind ProtagonistA 
 I'm working on the house ,  ProtagonistA replied , as if it was the most obvious thing in the world 
 I know , but ProtagonistA 've always wanted to build ProtagonistA's own house 
 And now ProtagonistA finally have the chance 
 ProtagonistA know , but ProtagonistA ca n't help it 
 ProtagonistA 've always wanted to build ProtagonistA's own house , and ProtagonistA 'm not going to let anything stop ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB's drive away before turning back to ProtagonistA's work 
 ProtagonistA knew it was n't going to be easy , but ProtagonistA was determined to build ProtagonistA's dream house 
 ProtagonistA had only brought fifteen dollars with ProtagonistA , intending to use the rest of ProtagonistA's money to buy some lunch before heading back home 
 Now , ProtagonistA would have to find a way to come up with the additional ten dollars somehow 
 ProtagonistA thought about asking ProtagonistB to let ProtagonistA pay the remainder later , but ProtagonistA wasn ' t sure if ProtagonistB would agree to that 
 ProtagonistA also considered asking some of the other people who were waiting in line behind ProtagonistA if they would be willing to loan ProtagonistA the money , but ProtagonistA didn ' t want to be a burden to anyone 
 Just then , ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name 
ProtagonistA was a dull boy , but not to the point of being a loner , except in the locality where ProtagonistA had an uncle , an aunt , and a cousin ; and as ProtagonistA was such a person , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA quite agreeable to everybody , even to the great majority of ProtagonistA's elders 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was out walking , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistA was so pleased with this compliment that ProtagonistA went home and told ProtagonistA's uncle about it 
 ProtagonistA 're still just a dull boy 
One morning , after the close of our first term , when the pain on my hand was beginning to subside , ProtagonistA issued a paper which ProtagonistA supposed to be a communication from his Majesty , for it bore the stamp of his Majesty 's office , and was filled with the seal of the State 
ProtagonistA was at the bar , nursing a beer and feeling sorry for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was just about to take a sip of ProtagonistA's beer when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB sitting at the other end of the bar 
 ProtagonistA felt a sudden surge of confidence and ProtagonistA decided to go talk to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and put ProtagonistA's hand on the glass , and slowly , with a gentle pressure , leaned it to the side 
  Can ProtagonistA buy ProtagonistB a drink ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA never would have had the courage to talk to ProtagonistB if it had n't been for that one simple act 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA knew the way to heaven but in fact ProtagonistA knew nothing at all 
 ProtagonistA had always been a good person , ProtagonistA went to church every Sunday , and ProtagonistA tithed 10 % of ProtagonistA's income 
 But one day , ProtagonistA met a man who told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was wrong 
 ProtagonistA asked the man to tell ProtagonistA more , and the man did 
 ProtagonistA had always thought that was a load of nonsense , but now ProtagonistA was starting to believe it 
 ProtagonistA did as the man said , and ProtagonistA felt a peace come over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had finally found the way to heaven 
ProtagonistA comes at night , the terror of ProtagonistA's lips , limber and voice , stronger than the deathbringer that lay before ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's teeth are black from blood 
 ProtagonistA was the one that the others whispered about , the one that they said came in the night and took people away 
 One night , ProtagonistA came for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA came up to ProtagonistB and grabbed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB away and no one ever saw ProtagonistB again 
ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA was five years old 
 ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistB everywhere with ProtagonistA 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was playing with ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA accidentally dropped ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB broke into pieces 
 ProtagonistA cried and cried for hours 
 ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA would always remember the good times ProtagonistB had together 
One day , soon after ProtagonistA had become a full - grown man , Mr
 ProtagonistA had never heard of ProtagonistB 
 No , sir , ProtagonistA have n't ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA had always been interested in philosophy and ProtagonistA had never heard of ProtagonistB before 
 ProtagonistA went to the library and found a book of ProtagonistB's writings 
 ProtagonistA read it eagerly , and was soon deep in thought , trying to understand the complex ideas contained within 
 ProtagonistA became a regular reader of ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA's ideas began to change 
 ProtagonistA started to see the world in a different way , and to question things that ProtagonistA had always taken for granted 
 ProtagonistA became a thinker and a philosopher ProtagonistA , and people started to listen to ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA spoke 
 ProtagonistA was making a difference in the world , just as the original Luke the Great had done 
 ProtagonistA never told anyone about ProtagonistA's gift , because ProtagonistA knew that they would never believe ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was content to live ProtagonistA's life quietly , until one day when ProtagonistA had a vision of a terrible future 
 In ProtagonistA's vision , ProtagonistA saw the world being consumed by a great fire , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to do something to stop it 
 ProtagonistA went to the local library and did some research on the future 
 ProtagonistA found out that there was going to be a big fire in the city , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to warn people 
 ProtagonistA went to the city hall and told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's vision 
 ProtagonistA had saved the city , and ProtagonistA was hailed as a hero 
There was once a boy who was known to everyone but ProtagonistB by ProtagonistA's given name – a boy called Noah , who was supposed to have been born in the year 1224 , on the very day that ProtagonistA was , according to some versions , murdered by a demon 
 ProtagonistA had been a happy , normal boy until the day that the demon came for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was there , just as ProtagonistB had feared , and ProtagonistA was in terrible shape 
 ProtagonistA died shortly after , never having recovered from the torture that ProtagonistA had endured 
It was the devil 's day , Cecil ! Ai n't gon na happen again , said ProtagonistA to the last man ProtagonistA saw of the forgotten white - bearded beauty of the East India ocean 
 ProtagonistA knew that there was someone up there , but ProtagonistA did n't know who it was 
 ProtagonistA had seen the light before , but never this close 
 ProtagonistA was about to go back to ProtagonistA's boat when ProtagonistA heard a voice 
 ProtagonistA could n't make out the words , but the voice was beautiful 
 ProtagonistA climbed up the rocks to get a better view , and when ProtagonistA got to the top , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so mesmerized by ProtagonistB's beauty that ProtagonistA forgot to be afraid 
 ProtagonistA could see the devil in ProtagonistB's eyes , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA was under ProtagonistB's spell 
  ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA was under ProtagonistB's spell , and ProtagonistA could n't think 
  ProtagonistA did n't resist 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was doomed 
 ProtagonistA sat down and looked at ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA wondered what ProtagonistC was thinking about 
 ProtagonistA smiled back at ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was happy to be there with ProtagonistC 
 One day , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's house to surprise ProtagonistB with a picnic lunch , but ProtagonistB was not home 
 ProtagonistA waited for a while , but ProtagonistB still did not come home 
 ProtagonistA decided to leave and come back another time 
 When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA found a note from ProtagonistB saying that ProtagonistB had broken up with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't believe ProtagonistB at first , but soon enough ProtagonistA started to see the signs 
 ProtagonistA was gaining more and more power , and people were following ProtagonistA blindly 
 ProtagonistA was on the verge of taking over the universe when something unforeseen happened 
ProtagonistA was a man , or at least ProtagonistA looked like one , of unquestionable fortune 
 ProtagonistA had a successful career , ProtagonistB , and two healthy children 
 But despite all of ProtagonistA's blessings , ProtagonistA was unhappy 
 ProtagonistA was constantly worried about money and ProtagonistB never seemed to understand ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to take a walk to clear ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA ended up at a small park that ProtagonistA had never noticed before 
 There , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA started visiting the park regularly to talk to ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA opening up to ProtagonistC in a way that ProtagonistA never had with anyone else 
 ProtagonistA finally felt understood 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to lose ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistA did n't want to lose ProtagonistA's family either 
 In the end , ProtagonistA made the difficult decision to end ProtagonistA's friendship 
ProtagonistA was in a dream in which ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so engrossed in the tale that ProtagonistA did n't even notice when ProtagonistB appeared before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was grateful for the opportunity to talk to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA left the meeting feeling inspired 
In the year of our Lord 1849 , in the month of May , ProtagonistA came to the door of the house at 14 James Street , and said ProtagonistA was going to Washington to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA had always wanted to meet ProtagonistB , and that ProtagonistA had heard that ProtagonistB was a good man 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistC and said goodbye 
 ProtagonistA arrived in Washington a few days later and went to the White House 
 ProtagonistA was very happy to have met ProtagonistB and to have had the chance to talk to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was an orphan who lived in a very poor village 
 ProtagonistA grew up to be a very rich man , although ProtagonistA could not certainly prove it 
ProtagonistA had been on ProtagonistA's usual wife - beating sprawl for hours , after how deeply ProtagonistA had been in debt and wasted luxury 
 ProtagonistA had been hitting ProtagonistB hard , leaving bruises all over ProtagonistB's body 
 ProtagonistA finally did , but not because ProtagonistA felt any remorse 
 ProtagonistA was just getting tired 
 ProtagonistA looked at her , lying there in a heap on the floor , and felt nothing 
 ProtagonistA turned and walked away , leaving ProtagonistB there to fend for ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA always kept to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA never talked to anyone at school and ProtagonistA always ate lunch alone 
 ProtagonistA did n't mind though 
 ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB was different than anyone ProtagonistA had ever talked to before 
 Slowly but surely , ProtagonistA started to open up 
 ProtagonistA started talking to ProtagonistB more and more and eventually , ProtagonistA started to make other friends too 
 ProtagonistA realized that being a loner was n't necessarily a bad thing 
 ProtagonistA was a very average looking guy 
 ProtagonistA had a job , ProtagonistB , and two kids 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was all alone 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to live without ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA had been in and out of the hospital for treatment , but it was no use 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's time was running out 
 On the morning that ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA was peering into the dusty corner of ProtagonistA's room and , spotting a tiny figure looming between a pair of awnings , knew immediately that it was ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA had seen this figure before in ProtagonistA's dreams , but never before in waking life 
 ProtagonistA calmly got out of bed and began to get dressed 
 ProtagonistA knew there was no point in prolonging the inevitable 
 ProtagonistA called ProtagonistB and told ProtagonistB to come to the hospital 
 ProtagonistA wanted to say goodbye while ProtagonistA still had the chance 
 When ProtagonistB arrived , ProtagonistA was already lying in ProtagonistA's hospital bed , hooked up to a machine that beeped with each of ProtagonistA's fading heartbeat 
 ProtagonistA managed to give ProtagonistB a weak smile and took ProtagonistB's hand in ProtagonistA 
 I'm sorry , my love ,  ProtagonistA whispered before ProtagonistA passed away 
 ProtagonistA had been lying in the same spot for so long that the blood had dried up and turned black 
When ProtagonistA was sent to take the starboard horse with ProtagonistA's officer , Lord Curzon , for the destination of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA had the honour of doing ProtagonistA's utmost to discover what was the real character of ProtagonistB 
 During their journey , ProtagonistA and Lord Curzon had many conversations with ProtagonistB 
 Based on these observations , ProtagonistA concluded that ProtagonistB was a good person with a strong character 
ProtagonistA had been a successful businessman in their hometown , but when the family moved to Melbourne , ProtagonistA was forced to take whatever job ProtagonistA could get 
 ProtagonistA always told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB was the smartest and most successful of all ProtagonistA's children and that ProtagonistB was destined for great things 
ProtagonistA had been living in Paris for two weeks , when ProtagonistA began to hear about a murder in Paris 
 ProtagonistA had never imagined that such a thing could happen in the city of love 
 ProtagonistA was even more shocked when ProtagonistA learned that ProtagonistB was a friend of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had met ProtagonistB at a party a few weeks before , and they had hit it off immediately 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe that ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistA was n't going to rest until ProtagonistA had justice for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was a very happy man , as ProtagonistA had always wanted a son 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were once married , but they were never only married 
 The middle age is the hardest age for any man , and not for the better , said ProtagonistA , for it is some years after the death of ProtagonistA's parents , that ProtagonistA come to the conclusion that the whole of humanity has become the same age , or , at best , a very long time into it 
 ProtagonistA was no longer the man ProtagonistB had married , but a shell of ProtagonistA's former self 
 ProtagonistA became a recluse , living in their home , barely interacting with the outside world 
 One day , ProtagonistA came to the realization that ProtagonistA had to let go of ProtagonistA's past and move on with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA sold the house and moved to a small apartment 
 ProtagonistA had found a cache of gold hidden in the wall , and ProtagonistA was determined to get ProtagonistA's hands on it 
 ProtagonistA began to dig through the rubble , and soon ProtagonistA found the gold 
 ProtagonistA was about to take it when ProtagonistA heard someone coming 
 ProtagonistA hid behind the wall and waited 
 ProtagonistA waited until ProtagonistB had found the gold , and then ProtagonistA attacked ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA managed to subdue ProtagonistB and take the gold 
 Then ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's escape 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would not be able to keep the gold for long , but ProtagonistA was determined to enjoy it while ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA was a very average man who lived a very average life 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA wanted to do something different with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA needed a change 
 So , ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's job , sold ProtagonistA's house , and bought a one - way ticket to Europe 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to travel , and now ProtagonistA finally had the chance 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going to go or what ProtagonistA was going to do , but ProtagonistA was excited for the adventure 
 For the first few weeks , ProtagonistA just wandered around Europe , enjoying the sights and sounds of the different countries 
 ProtagonistA did n't have any specific plans , but ProtagonistA was content just taking everything in 
 One day , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a small town in Italy 
 ProtagonistA did n't know why , but ProtagonistA felt drawn to the town 
 ProtagonistA decided to wander around and see what it had to offer 
 As ProtagonistA was walking , ProtagonistA came across a small cafe 
 ProtagonistA decided to go in and get a cup of coffee 
 As ProtagonistA was waiting for ProtagonistA's coffee , ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB sitting in the corner 
 ProtagonistA felt bad for ProtagonistB , so ProtagonistA decided to buy ProtagonistB some food 
 ProtagonistA ended up spending the rest of the day with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA bought ProtagonistB some food and took ProtagonistB to the park to play 
 ProtagonistA quickly fell in love with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA wanted to take care of ProtagonistB 
 The next day , ProtagonistA went back to the cafe and asked the owner if ProtagonistA could have ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB ProtagonistB , and the two of them quickly became best friends 
 ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA had taken the chance to do something different with ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a man who loved to play tricks on people 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA smiled at ProtagonistB and said ,  Hey there , ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA bet ProtagonistB 'd like to hear a joke 
 Don't worry ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA promise ProtagonistB 'll like this one 
 ProtagonistA smiled and walked away , knowing that ProtagonistA had just made ProtagonistB's day a little bit brighter 
ProtagonistA was walking home from school one day when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing in front of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was the devil 
 ProtagonistA thought for a moment and then wished for a million dollars 
 ProtagonistA thought about this for a while and then agreed 
 ProtagonistA told them that ProtagonistA had made a deal with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to , but ProtagonistA knew that it was the right thing to do 
 ProtagonistA gave the money back to ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's soul back 
 ProtagonistA learned a valuable lesson that day 
 ProtagonistA learned that it is better to be good than to be rich 
ProtagonistA had been working in ProtagonistA's office for years , and ProtagonistA knew every inch of it 
 ProtagonistA also knew every inch of the surrounding area , including the old building next door 
 One day , ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB standing next to the old building 
 ProtagonistA wondered what ProtagonistB was doing 
 ProtagonistA decided to talk to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistB was an orphan who had run away from the orphanage 
 ProtagonistA took pity on ProtagonistB and offered to let ProtagonistB stay in ProtagonistA's office 
 ProtagonistA allowed ProtagonistB to stay in ProtagonistA's office for a few weeks 
 ProtagonistA even helped ProtagonistB find a job at the local grocery store 
 ProtagonistA never saw ProtagonistB again , but ProtagonistA always wondered how ProtagonistB was doing 
A hundred years ago , in the year 1873 , ProtagonistA happened to meet ProtagonistB in the city of Detroit 
 ProtagonistA was skeptical at first , but ProtagonistB was adamant that ProtagonistC would bring salvation to their people 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to believe , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to be ready just in case 
 As the days passed , ProtagonistA began to see more and more signs that ProtagonistB's vision was true 
 One night , ProtagonistA even saw a star shining brighter than any other in the sky 
 ProtagonistA was sure that this was a sign from the gods that ProtagonistC was indeed coming 
 ProtagonistA went to tell ProtagonistB what ProtagonistA had seen , but ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistA never saw ProtagonistB again , but ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistB's words 
 When ProtagonistC finally arrived , ProtagonistA was there to greet ProtagonistC with open arms 
 ProtagonistA knew that this was the beginning of a new era for their people , and ProtagonistA was proud to be a part of it 
ProtagonistA died on a rainy day in 19 , 18 , so ProtagonistA was about 21 when I was born 
 When ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had finally found ProtagonistA's match 
 ProtagonistA was also still grieving the loss of ProtagonistA's first wife , and ProtagonistA found it difficult to open up to ProtagonistB 
 Despite the challenges , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB loved each other deeply , and they were determined to make their marriage work 
 ProtagonistA was very pleased with ProtagonistB's work , and ProtagonistA soon began to think of ProtagonistB as a son 
 ProtagonistA went to the house and got ProtagonistA's gun , and then ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB went out to meet the soldiers 
 ProtagonistA told the soldier that ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's only son , and that ProtagonistA could n't let ProtagonistB go 
 ProtagonistA pleaded with the soldier , but it was no use 
 Some time later , ProtagonistA heard that the war was over , and that ProtagonistB was coming home 
 ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA went to meet ProtagonistB at the edge of ProtagonistA's property 
 ProtagonistA was proud of ProtagonistB , and they both knew that they had been through a lot , but that they were stronger for it 
ProtagonistA had been working at the company for years , and ProtagonistA had always been a good , reliable employee 
 But ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA was being taken for granted 
 ProtagonistA was always the one who was stuck doing the grunt work , while the other employees got the credit 
 And ProtagonistA was always the one who was passed over for promotions 
 ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA's opinion did n't matter 
 But that all changed on the day ProtagonistA finally had the courage to speak ProtagonistA's mind 
 ProtagonistA went into ProtagonistB's office and told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was unhappy with the way ProtagonistA was being treated 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA deserved more responsibility and more credit for ProtagonistA's work 
 And ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was ready for a promotion 
 ProtagonistB was surprised at first , but ProtagonistB quickly realized that ProtagonistA was right 
 ProtagonistA felt great after finally speaking ProtagonistA's mind 
 ProtagonistA was no longer the doormat at work , and ProtagonistA was finally being treated with the respect ProtagonistA deserved 
There was once a boy with a very big , very round face and very large eyes and a very small head , but who was much more important than the rest of the boys in the school , and who had played a very important part in ProtagonistB's life , and whose name was ProtagonistA ; and ProtagonistA was a very good , well - behaved boy , and of a very good family , and in a very good school , and was a very useful and useful growth 
 ProtagonistA had been one of ProtagonistB's best friends when they were both at school together , and had always stuck up for ProtagonistB when the other boys teased ProtagonistB about ProtagonistB's big head 
ProtagonistA had not known the time when ProtagonistA would die , but it was an unpleasant year for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had been worse for it 
 ProtagonistA had been in and out of the hospital for months , and ProtagonistB had been by ProtagonistA's side the whole time 
 ProtagonistA wanted to spend ProtagonistA's remaining time with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was grateful that ProtagonistB was there with ProtagonistA 
One Sunday morning , ProtagonistA was making tea for the family when ProtagonistA was startled to discover that ProtagonistB had gone into labour 
ProtagonistA stood upright , staring thoughtfully at the cold , silver plate before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA remembered the last time ProtagonistA had seen one 
 ProtagonistA had been married for fifty years when ProtagonistB passed away 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to go on without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA spent ProtagonistA's days sitting in their house , staring at ProtagonistB's pictures and thinking about the happy times they had shared 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across an old silver plate in the back of a cupboard 
 ProtagonistA did n't know why ProtagonistA had n't seen it before 
 ProtagonistA stared at the plate for a long time , thinking about ProtagonistB 
 Then ProtagonistA got up and went to the kitchen 
 ProtagonistA took out a pot of soup and placed it on the plate 
 ProtagonistA sat down at the table and began to eat 
 As ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA thought about all the wonderful times ProtagonistA had shared with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that even though ProtagonistB was gone , ProtagonistB would always be with ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's heart 
ProtagonistA had been using ProtagonistA's hearing to the full when ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been eavesdropping on their conversations for months , and ProtagonistA knew exactly what buttons to push to make them snap 
 ProtagonistA waited until they were in the heat of an argument , and then ProtagonistA struck 
 ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistB over the head with a heavy object , and then ProtagonistA stabbed ProtagonistB repeatedly 
 ProtagonistA was finally free from ProtagonistB's tyranny 
ProtagonistA was a man of extremely high moral character and , although ProtagonistA had the greatest number of notables of every description in the world , besides ProtagonistB and children , was altogether a very poor man 
 ProtagonistA had never been able to keep a job for more than a few months , and ProtagonistB always had to work to support the family 
 ProtagonistA was always getting into fights with other men and getting fired because of it 
 ProtagonistA was also a heavy drinker , which did n't help ProtagonistA's situation 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's job again and that ProtagonistA was sorry 
 ProtagonistA begged ProtagonistB to stay , but ProtagonistB did n't listen 
 ProtagonistA was now alone in the house and ProtagonistA had no idea what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to drink anymore , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to stop 
 ProtagonistA decided to go to AA meetings and try to get ProtagonistA's life back on track 
 With the help of ProtagonistA's AA group , ProtagonistA was able to stop drinking and get ProtagonistA's life back on track 
 ProtagonistA was able to find a job and support ProtagonistA's family again 
 ProtagonistA is now a changed man and ProtagonistA is grateful for everything that AA has done for ProtagonistA 
Once , when ProtagonistA was only eleven , ProtagonistA became really bored 
 ProtagonistA had nothing to do , and no one to talk to 
 So ProtagonistA decided to go for a walk 
 ProtagonistA went down the street and around the corner , and then ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA ran over to ProtagonistB and asked if ProtagonistB was okay 
 ProtagonistA offered to help ProtagonistB carry ProtagonistB's bag , but ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB could manage 
The night ProtagonistA was arrested , ProtagonistA awoke to find ProtagonistA in a cell with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistA was in for 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB how ProtagonistB could have done something like that 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head in disbelief 
 ProtagonistA could n't imagine what it would be like to kill someone 
 ProtagonistA wondered if ProtagonistB felt any remorse for what ProtagonistB had done 
 ProtagonistA sighed and shook ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA just sat there in silence , wondering what ProtagonistA's own fate would be 
 ProtagonistA had always thought ProtagonistB to be a cold , heartless woman , and ProtagonistA was glad to see that ProtagonistB had finally found someone to love ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was going to China , but first ProtagonistA was going to see ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistB's house , ProtagonistA was shocked to see how much it had changed 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what had happened , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had been struggling since ProtagonistA left 
 ProtagonistA felt guilty 
 ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would come back and help ProtagonistB , but first ProtagonistA had to go to China 
ProtagonistA had been reading aloud from the ' History of the United States of America ' when ProtagonistA noticed a word in a Latin text on the back page 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to find a word ProtagonistA recognized in a language ProtagonistA was studying that ProtagonistA read it aloud to ProtagonistA's class 
ProtagonistA approached the throne upon an armchair not as a king , but as a dandy , ProtagonistA a success , but no more than a short - cut , with ProtagonistB at full term , ProtagonistA sat down to lunch , and took a stool in the sofas on the other side of the table 
 ProtagonistA was not expecting much , but ProtagonistA was pleasantly surprised when a sumptuous meal was served before ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistA leaned back in ProtagonistA's chair , contentedly sipping ProtagonistA's wine , when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB glaring at ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA are not fit to sit in the presence of the king !  ProtagonistA merely shrugged and said ,  ProtagonistA am a success , but no more than a short - cut 
 ProtagonistA did so , but not before giving ProtagonistB a parting shot
