ProtagonistA was not planning to marry , not until ProtagonistA had had ProtagonistA's fill of the immaculate manse . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner , content to live in ProtagonistA's small , one - bedroom apartment . But when ProtagonistA inherited ProtagonistA's uncle 's estate , everything changed . ProtagonistA suddenly found ProtagonistA the owner of a sprawling mansion .

ProtagonistA was grateful that ProtagonistA took the plunge and experienced the joys of fatherhood firsthand . 
ProtagonistA was a baby when ProtagonistA heard the message , scarcely able even to sit up , but , in all probability , sitting still . It is a terrible , terrible idea , even if entirely accidental , to talk to one of the Ancient Ones . The message was clear and concise : Do not talk to the Ancient Ones . They are beyond our understanding and their ways are not our ways . ProtagonistA , being a baby , did not understand the message . ProtagonistA did not understand the danger . ProtagonistA did not understand the consequences . ProtagonistA did not understand anything . So , when ProtagonistA saw an Ancient One walking by , ProtagonistA called out to it .

The sun rose slowly over the city , but in the midst of all the misery of the war - torn city , ProtagonistA rose up .

ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's voice sounding tired even to ProtagonistA's own ears . Hey , ProtagonistA ,  came the reply . It was ProtagonistB .  What are ProtagonistA up to?Nothing much ,  ProtagonistA said .  Just lying on the floor . You sound like ProtagonistA 're in a funk ,  ProtagonistB said .  What 's going on?Bob sighed .  ProtagonistA 'm just feeling a bit down about ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA guess . Hey , it 's not so bad ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA 're a great writer . ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA 'll get published one day . Thanks , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA appreciate the vote of confidence . Any time , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  Listen , ProtagonistB 'm going to grab a beer . ProtagonistA want to join me?Sure ,  ProtagonistA said , getting up off the floor .  ProtagonistA could use a drink . And with that , ProtagonistA's day started to look a little bit brighter . 
ProtagonistA stood on the leadstaff of the slave ship and looked down at ProtagonistA's own bare feet . ProtagonistA had been a slave for as long as ProtagonistA could remember , and ProtagonistA had never known anything but the inside of a ship . ProtagonistA had never seen ProtagonistA's home , or ProtagonistA's family . ProtagonistA did n't even know what ProtagonistA's real name was . The only thing ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistA was a slave , and that ProtagonistA would always be a slave . One day , ProtagonistA was brought up on deck to see the sun for the first time . ProtagonistA was so amazed by the sight that ProtagonistA forgot to be scared . For the first time in ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA felt free . The next day , ProtagonistA was put to work on the ship . ProtagonistA worked hard , and ProtagonistA was soon the best worker on the ship . The other slaves started to look up to ProtagonistA , and they started to call ProtagonistA ' Bob' . Eventually , the ship reached its destination , and the slaves were sold . ProtagonistA was bought by a kind man who treated ProtagonistA well . ProtagonistA was given a new name , and ProtagonistA was finally free . ProtagonistA never forgot the years ProtagonistA spent as a slave , but ProtagonistA was grateful for the rest of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had been lucky , and ProtagonistA vowed to help other slaves escape their fate . 
ProtagonistA had said it was fine ; it was , as it were , the best thing that ever happened to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA felt that it had been the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had been happy with ProtagonistA's life before , but now ProtagonistA was even happier . ProtagonistA had never felt this way before , and ProtagonistA was sure that it was all because of what had happened . 
ProtagonistA was a middle - aged man who was pretty good looking , although ProtagonistA looked as if ProtagonistA had been out in the sun too much . ProtagonistA worked as a gardener and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's job . ProtagonistA was always out in the sun , working hard and making things look beautiful . One day , ProtagonistA was working in ProtagonistA's garden when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking by . ProtagonistA could n't help but stare at ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was so beautiful . ProtagonistA had never seen someone so beautiful in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistB walked by ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA just watched ProtagonistB , admiring ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA had always been a happy child . ProtagonistA loved going to school and playing with ProtagonistA's friends . But when ProtagonistA was nine years old , ProtagonistA heard something that would change ProtagonistA's life forever . ProtagonistA's father had died . ProtagonistA did n't know how to react . ProtagonistA was sad , scared , and angry all at the same time . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do without ProtagonistA's father . But ProtagonistA had to be strong . ProtagonistA had to be there for ProtagonistA's mother and sister . ProtagonistA knew they needed ProtagonistA now more than ever . 
ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA that when ProtagonistA was six years old , ProtagonistA sat in a room in their house and watched as ProtagonistB made ProtagonistB's landing in the greenery of a tall , dark , green tree . ProtagonistA was fascinated by ProtagonistB and followed ProtagonistB's every move . ProtagonistA even named ProtagonistB  Bob  after ProtagonistA . As ProtagonistA watched , ProtagonistB would climb up the tree , then back down again . ProtagonistB would go from one leaf to another , always exploring . ProtagonistA was so fascinated by ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA even started to imitate ProtagonistB's movements . ProtagonistA would climb up and down the furniture in the room , always keeping an eye on ProtagonistB . One day , ProtagonistC came into the room and saw what ProtagonistA was doing . ProtagonistC was so impressed by ProtagonistA's dedication to following ProtagonistB that ProtagonistC decided to take ProtagonistA outside to see the real thing . It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was so excited to see ProtagonistB in ProtagonistB's natural habitat . ProtagonistC showed ProtagonistA how to find ProtagonistB and then let ProtagonistA watch ProtagonistB for as long as ProtagonistA wanted . ProtagonistA was so thrilled that ProtagonistA had been able to see ProtagonistB up close and in person . It was an experience ProtagonistA would never forget . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner . ProtagonistA never really had any close friends , but ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life . That is , until the end of the year . Less than an hour after the end of the year , ProtagonistA was found murdered in ProtagonistA's apartment , ProtagonistA's throat slit . The police had no leads and no suspects . ProtagonistA's life seemed to be a complete mystery . But there was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA's neighbor , Sarah . ProtagonistB had always been friendly with ProtagonistA , even though ProtagonistA was a bit of a recluse . ProtagonistB would always say hello to ProtagonistA when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA and they would sometimes have brief conversations . But ProtagonistB knew that there was something more to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB could sense that ProtagonistA was hiding something . ProtagonistB decided to take it upon ProtagonistB to find out what happened to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB started snooping around ProtagonistA's apartment and talking to ProtagonistA's friends . Eventually , ProtagonistB pieced together the story . ProtagonistA had been involved in a secret relationship with a man . ProtagonistA's family was not accepting of ProtagonistA's lifestyle and they had threatened to disown ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA was struggling to keep up the facade of being a straight man . The night of ProtagonistA's murder , ProtagonistA had finally decided that ProtagonistA could n't take it anymore . ProtagonistA was going to come out to ProtagonistA's family and tell them the truth . But before ProtagonistA could do that , ProtagonistA was killed . ProtagonistB was devastated . ProtagonistB could n't believe that someone would kill ProtagonistA just because ProtagonistA was gay . ProtagonistB went to the police and told them what ProtagonistB had found out . With ProtagonistB's help , they were able to arrest ProtagonistA's family and bring them to justice . ProtagonistB was glad that ProtagonistB was able to help ProtagonistA , even though ProtagonistB never got the chance to really know ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was a fine , cheerful girl of fifteen years of age , who had a cheerful manner , and good sense , but no very good sense ; and though ProtagonistA was wo nt to be a good - humoured and a happy - go - lucky girl , ProtagonistA was not without a certain air of melancholy . It was this which made ProtagonistA so interesting to ProtagonistA's companions , who were always glad to see ProtagonistA , but never quite sure what to make of ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was three years old when ProtagonistA was brought to bay in the arms of a British soldier . ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what was happening . The soldier was kind to ProtagonistA and explained that ProtagonistA was going to be taken to a new home . ProtagonistA was scared at first , but the soldier reassured ProtagonistA that everything would be alright . ProtagonistA was taken to a new home where ProtagonistA met new people . ProtagonistA was scared at first , but ProtagonistA soon warmed up to ProtagonistA's new family . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's new home and was happy to be there . 
Now , what is it ? said ProtagonistC to the old woman who lay on ProtagonistA back in a critical state , trying to escape the vault with ProtagonistA's head down , as if ProtagonistA had suddenly realized what it was ProtagonistA had been planning . ProtagonistB's eyes were wide and ProtagonistB was gasping for breath . ProtagonistB do n't know , ProtagonistB said . ProtagonistB do n't know . ProtagonistC looked at ProtagonistB sympathetically and then turned to ProtagonistA . What is it , ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistC said . What 's wrong ? ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head , still trying to escape the vault . ProtagonistA do n't know , ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistA do n't know . ProtagonistC sighed and turned back to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistC 'm sorry , ProtagonistC said . ProtagonistC 'm sorry . ProtagonistC 'm sorry . 
One cold , gray November day , after a long winter 's heat , and a placid and happy season of summer , ProtagonistA , lay on ProtagonistA's bed in the green garden of ProtagonistA's maternal grandmother 's , thinking of the wholesome things that a well - ordered house could do for the comfort of the mind and body , without the extra expense of a large house , or a great purchase of land , or any other thing of the kind ; and in consequence of these wholesome things , the mind and body improved so much , that from the time that ProtagonistA was quite able to think , ProtagonistA could form any idea , no matter how dim and conflicting , regarding any particular object or thing , unless absolutely absolutely necessary ; and ProtagonistA thus became a very pretty , and very intelligent , and very happy woman , and saved ProtagonistA's family much distress , expense , and trouble , and earned in itself a considerable profit . 
ProtagonistA sat down in the heather green armchair in ProtagonistA's little office and talked .  ProtagonistA 'm so glad you could come ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 've been wanting to talk to you for a long time .  ProtagonistA paused , then continued .  ProtagonistA know we have n't always seen eye to eye , but ProtagonistA hope we can put that behind us . ProtagonistA 've been thinking about you a lot lately , and ProtagonistA really miss you .  ProtagonistA's voice was soft and sincere , and ProtagonistA's eyes were full of emotion .  ProtagonistA know ProtagonistA 've made some mistakes , but ProtagonistA 'm hoping you 'll forgive ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA promise to make it up to you . ProtagonistA love you , and ProtagonistA hope you 'll give ProtagonistA another chance .  
ProtagonistA was sleeping and felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA woke up to find that ProtagonistA was bleeding from a wound on ProtagonistA's forehead . ProtagonistA got up and went to the bathroom to clean ProtagonistA up . ProtagonistA looked in the mirror and saw that the wound was deep and would need stitches . ProtagonistA went to the hospital to get treatment . 
There was once ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had a childish liking for sports . ProtagonistA always wanted to play with the other kids , but they always made fun of ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA decided to try out for the school soccer team . ProtagonistA was the worst player on the team , but ProtagonistA kept trying . Eventually , ProtagonistA became the captain of the team . ProtagonistA led them to the state championships and they won . ProtagonistA was finally accepted by ProtagonistA's peers . 
ProtagonistA had always been a healthy man , so it came as a shock to the family when ProtagonistA suddenly died . ProtagonistB was only 18 at the time , and ProtagonistA's death left ProtagonistB with a small fortune of a few thousand pounds . ProtagonistB was determined to make something of ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB used ProtagonistA's money to start ProtagonistB's own business . ProtagonistB was successful , and ProtagonistB quickly became one of the richest men in the country . ProtagonistB never forgot ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB always remembered the day that ProtagonistA died . 
ProtagonistB had known ProtagonistA for years , ever since they were kids . ProtagonistA was always one of the nicest people ProtagonistB knew , always willing to help others . When ProtagonistB was struggling in school , ProtagonistA was the one who tutored ProtagonistB and helped ProtagonistB get back on track . When ProtagonistB was going through a tough time in ProtagonistB's life , ProtagonistA was the one who was there for ProtagonistB , supporting ProtagonistB and helping ProtagonistB get through it . ProtagonistA was truly one of the greatest people ProtagonistB had ever known . And now ProtagonistA was gone . ProtagonistB could n't believe it when ProtagonistB heard the news . ProtagonistA had passed away suddenly , and it hit ProtagonistB like a ton of bricks . ProtagonistB was devastated . ProtagonistB could n't imagine life without ProtagonistA . But even in ProtagonistB's grief , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA would want ProtagonistB to be strong . ProtagonistA would want ProtagonistB to live ProtagonistB's life to the fullest and to help others , just like ProtagonistA always did . And that 's what ProtagonistB vowed to do . ProtagonistB would honor ProtagonistA's memory by being the best person ProtagonistB could be . 
ProtagonistA had always been a happy - go - lucky guy . ProtagonistA was always smiling and making jokes , no matter what the situation . But that all changed when ProtagonistA was in a car accident . ProtagonistA was hit by a drunk driver and was in a coma for weeks . When ProtagonistA finally woke up , ProtagonistA was a different person . ProtagonistA was angry and resentful . ProtagonistA had no patience for anything . ProtagonistA would never be the same again . 
ProtagonistA was borne in the City of London , between eight and ten o'clock , on Tuesday , the twenty - first day of June , 1688 . ProtagonistA was born to the Island of Dunk , in the Sound of the Sea , where ProtagonistA remained until the arrival of the King 's Majesty . ProtagonistA was a strong and healthy baby , and ProtagonistA's parents were very happy . The King 's Majesty was very pleased with ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was given a place in the royal court . 
The sun rose red in the sky , and ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's gleaming blue eyes bored into the dark depths of the ocean , a sight the captain of the ocean liner had surely seen many times before . But this time , something was different . This time , there was a creature in the water , a creature that ProtagonistA had never seen before . The creature was huge , its body as large as the ocean liner itself . Its skin was a deep blue , and its eyes were a bright green . ProtagonistA could see the creature 's mouth moving , but ProtagonistA could n't hear what it was saying . The captain of the ocean liner came over to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could see the fear in the man 's eyes . What is it ?  ProtagonistA asked . I do n't know ,  the captain replied .  But whatever it is , it 's heading straight for us . The creature came closer and closer , and ProtagonistA could see that its mouth was full of sharp teeth . The captain ordered all of the passengers to evacuate the ship , and ProtagonistA was one of the first to jump into the lifeboat . As the lifeboat drifted away from the ship , ProtagonistA looked back at the creature . It was still coming , and it looked angry . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had seen something that nobody else had ever seen before , and ProtagonistA would never forget it . 
One day , when ProtagonistA was about twelve years old , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were riding in the back of a coach through the suburbs of New York . They had just left the city and were on their way to visit ProtagonistA's grandparents in the country . As they rode along , ProtagonistB pointed out the different sights to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA the houses of the rich people and the poor people and told ProtagonistA about the different kinds of people who lived in the city . ProtagonistA was very interested in everything ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA . After a while , they came to a stop in front of a large house . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that this was the house of a very wealthy man . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to look at the house and imagine what it would be like to live there . ProtagonistA looked at the house and thought it looked very nice . ProtagonistA could imagine ProtagonistA living there one day . 
ProtagonistA preserved all ProtagonistA's memories in a jar on ProtagonistA's shelf . ProtagonistA would take them out and look at them often , reliving the moments ProtagonistA had experienced . One day , ProtagonistA decided to share ProtagonistA's memories with ProtagonistA's family . ProtagonistA took the jar down and opened it , revealing all the memories ProtagonistA had collected over the years . ProtagonistA's family was amazed and delighted to see them . They laughed and cried as they looked through the memories , each one bringing back a different time and feeling . ProtagonistA was happy to share ProtagonistA's memories with ProtagonistA's family , and they were happy to experience them with ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was standing at the airport , waiting for ProtagonistA's flight when ProtagonistA heard the crashing of small - arms fire and the effect of the machine gun . ProtagonistA turned and saw a group of men running towards ProtagonistA , firing as they came . Without thinking , ProtagonistA turned and ran in the opposite direction . ProtagonistA could hear the men behind ProtagonistA , getting closer and closer . Just as they were about to catch ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's flight boarding and ProtagonistA made a dash for it . ProtagonistA barely made it on board as the men arrived and started firing at the plane . The plane took off and ProtagonistA was safe . 
Once upon a time , ProtagonistA was very passionate about something . ProtagonistA was so passionate , in fact , that ProtagonistA made it ProtagonistA's life 's work . ProtagonistA was always determined to be the best at whatever ProtagonistA did , and ProtagonistA never gave up , no matter how hard things got . ProtagonistA's passion was evident to everyone who knew ProtagonistA , and it was clear that ProtagonistA was going to achieve great things . 
ProtagonistA was a man who knew how to make a good buy . ProtagonistA was always looking for the best deals and the best prices . ProtagonistA died a few years ago , but ProtagonistA's legacy lives on . ProtagonistA was a man who was always looking out for others and ProtagonistA always had their best interests at heart . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a klutz , so it was no surprise when ProtagonistA stepped on the monkey 's foot . The monkey let out a loud screech , and ProtagonistA apologized profusely . The monkey 's owner came over and scolded ProtagonistA , but the monkey just looked at ProtagonistA with a twinkle in its eye . It seemed to forgive ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA felt relieved . From then on , ProtagonistA was extra careful around monkeys . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a rebel . ProtagonistA was never one for following the rules and ProtagonistA always seemed to be stirring up trouble . ProtagonistA's parents had given up on ProtagonistA long ago , but ProtagonistA's grandparents had never given up hope . They had been waiting for ProtagonistA like that since the day ProtagonistA 'd turned seventeen . ProtagonistA had been in and out of trouble with the law since ProtagonistA was a teenager . ProtagonistA had been in and out of jail more times than ProtagonistA's grandparents could count . They had always bailed ProtagonistA out , no matter what . ProtagonistA's latest stint in jail had been for a DUI . ProtagonistA had been in jail for a few months and ProtagonistA's grandparents had been waiting for ProtagonistA to get out . They had been there for ProtagonistA every step of the way , even though they did n't always agree with ProtagonistA's choices . ProtagonistA finally got out of jail and ProtagonistA's grandparents were there to pick ProtagonistA up . They were happy to see ProtagonistA , but they could see the toll that this latest incident had taken on ProtagonistA . They could see that ProtagonistA was finally ready to turn ProtagonistA's life around . ProtagonistA's grandparents had always been there for ProtagonistA and they always will be . They know that ProtagonistA is not perfect , but they love ProtagonistA anyway . They will continue to wait for ProtagonistA , no matter what . 
The last time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a man . ProtagonistB was a man who was in a relationship with a woman and they had two children together . ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a happy man who was content with ProtagonistB's life . 
It was a cold and windy Sunday afternoon and ProtagonistA reported ProtagonistA 'd been kidnapped . The police were called and a search began . ProtagonistA was found several hours later , cold and hungry . ProtagonistA told the police that ProtagonistA 'd been taken by a group of men who demanded ransom . ProtagonistA was able to give a description of ProtagonistA's kidnappers and the police were able to find them and arrest them . 
ProtagonistB had been sick for a long time and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB's death was inevitable . When it finally happened , ProtagonistA was at work . ProtagonistA got a call from ProtagonistA's father , who was sobbing uncontrollably . ProtagonistA could barely understand what ProtagonistA's father was saying , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to go home . When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB's body lying in ProtagonistB's bed . ProtagonistB looked peaceful , but ProtagonistA felt the dread of death wash over ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's life would never be the same without ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the corner of the sofa , with ProtagonistA's head resting on the edge of the sofa , when ProtagonistA heard the front door open . ProtagonistA knew it was ProtagonistB , coming home from work . ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB put ProtagonistB's keys down on the table and hang up ProtagonistB's coat . Then , ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB's footsteps coming towards the living room . When ProtagonistB entered the room , ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA sitting on the sofa with ProtagonistA's head resting on the edge of the sofa . ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what was wrong . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was just tired and needed a nap . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could take a nap on the bed . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA was comfortable where ProtagonistA was and that ProtagonistA would just stay on the sofa . ProtagonistB said that was fine and went to the kitchen to make dinner . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner . ProtagonistA was never really comfortable around people and preferred to spend ProtagonistA's time alone in nature . So , when ProtagonistA was asked to go on a camping trip with some friends , ProtagonistA was hesitant . But , ProtagonistA decided to go for it and ended up having a great time . One night , around the campfire , ProtagonistA began to feel a bit uneasy . The cold wind howled and ProtagonistA's hair stirred . ProtagonistA's face grew red and pouted and ProtagonistA's eyes flashed with fear . But , ProtagonistA put out a soft smile that had the air of a quarter and continued to enjoy the night . 
ProtagonistA 's got so much money that ProtagonistA sleeps in ProtagonistA's own bed every night . ProtagonistA 's got a butler who brings ProtagonistA breakfast in bed every morning , and ProtagonistA never has to worry about money again . ProtagonistA's life is one of luxury and ease , and ProtagonistA 's loving every minute of it . 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking hand in hand with a dead man . ProtagonistA felt a strong urge to help , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if it was any of ProtagonistA's business . ProtagonistA could have easily gone either way , but ProtagonistA decided to help . ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and asked if ProtagonistB needed any help . ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA and said that ProtagonistB was just taking ProtagonistB's friend for a walk . 
To Susan and Jethro 's mother — the widow of ProtagonistB — Mrs. Samantha Duryea , of the parsonage where ProtagonistA had been left and ProtagonistE : It was a cold , dark night when ProtagonistB set sail on ProtagonistB's final voyage . ProtagonistC , and their two young sons , ProtagonistD and ProtagonistA , watched from the shore as the ship disappeared into the fog . They knew they would never see ProtagonistB again . ProtagonistC was a strong woman , but the loss of ProtagonistB was devastating . ProtagonistC did ProtagonistC's best to keep up a brave front for ProtagonistC's sons , but there were many sleepless nights . ProtagonistD was only five years old when ProtagonistB died , but ProtagonistD was very aware of the pain ProtagonistC was in . ProtagonistD did ProtagonistD's best to be a good boy , hoping to make ProtagonistC proud . ProtagonistA was only three , and ProtagonistA did n't really understand what was happening . ProtagonistA just knew that ProtagonistB was gone and ProtagonistA's mommy was sad . ProtagonistC did ProtagonistC's best to keep the family going , but it was hard . They were struggling financially , and ProtagonistC was constantly worried about how ProtagonistC was going to make ends meet . One day , ProtagonistC received a letter from ProtagonistE . ProtagonistE told ProtagonistC that ProtagonistE was coming to visit and that ProtagonistE had something for ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was excited to see ProtagonistE , and ProtagonistC eagerly awaited ProtagonistE's arrival . When ProtagonistE arrived , ProtagonistE brought with ProtagonistE a large chest . ProtagonistE told ProtagonistC that it contained ProtagonistB's belongings , including ProtagonistB's sword , ProtagonistB's pistol , and ProtagonistB's journal . ProtagonistC was overwhelmed with emotions . ProtagonistC was so grateful to ProtagonistE for bringing ProtagonistC these precious items . ProtagonistC knew that they would be a source of comfort for ProtagonistC and ProtagonistC's sons . As ProtagonistC looked through the journal , ProtagonistC was filled with pride . ProtagonistC could see the love that ProtagonistB had for ProtagonistB's family , and ProtagonistC was reminded of the happy times they had shared . The journal was a source of strength for ProtagonistC during the dark days that followed . It was a reminder that ProtagonistB had loved ProtagonistC and their sons , and that ProtagonistC was not alone . 
ProtagonistA was lying upon the ground , ProtagonistA's arms stretched out in front of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's legs crossed , ProtagonistA's head resting on the side of ProtagonistA's hands . ProtagonistA was staring up at the sky , admiring the clouds that were floating by . ProtagonistA felt at peace lying there , and ProtagonistA did n't want to move . ProtagonistA wanted to stay in that moment forever . 
ProtagonistA's friends called ProtagonistA's squire , but ProtagonistA would not cast a glance aside , for ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's husband ! ProtagonistA was always there for ProtagonistA , no matter what ProtagonistA needed . ProtagonistA was ProtagonistA's rock , ProtagonistA's protector . And ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA for it . 
We had just left ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's anchor in the water , when ProtagonistB , in a singular instance , which must have occurred to most of the passengers , jumped into the sea . ProtagonistB had been playing on the deck and must have slipped and fallen overboard . We all saw ProtagonistB fall and ProtagonistA immediately threw the anchor overboard and started the engines to go back and rescue ProtagonistB . We were all so relieved when ProtagonistA pulled ProtagonistB out of the water and onto the deck of the boat . ProtagonistB was coughing and choking but ProtagonistB was alive . We all thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's quick thinking and heroic actions . 
One day in August , a winter in the West , ProtagonistA came to a village to pick up ProtagonistC . When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA found that the village was in the middle of a snowstorm . ProtagonistA went to the nearest house and knocked on the door . ProtagonistB answered . ProtagonistA asked if ProtagonistA could come in and warm up . ProtagonistB let ProtagonistA in and introduced ProtagonistB as Sarah . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB's husband was out looking for ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA was looking for ProtagonistC as well . ProtagonistB offered to help ProtagonistA look for ProtagonistC . They went out into the storm and searched for ProtagonistC . After a while , they found ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA was reunited with ProtagonistC and they all went back to ProtagonistB's house . ProtagonistB's husband had returned with ProtagonistC . They all had a warm meal and a good night 's sleep . In the morning , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC left for home . ProtagonistA was very grateful to ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's family for their help . 
ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistB's head , and down at ProtagonistB's feet , and said ,  ProtagonistB 'll be ProtagonistB's companion .  Then ProtagonistA went on ProtagonistA's way . 
The night ProtagonistA rose from ProtagonistA's deepest sleep ProtagonistA was found by ProtagonistB in the midst of the crowd of people who were gathered below the palace . ProtagonistA was dazed and confused , but ProtagonistB was overjoyed to see ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had been asleep for years , ever since ProtagonistA was a child . ProtagonistB had never given up hope that ProtagonistA would one day wake up . And now , on this night , ProtagonistB had finally done so . The crowd below was cheering and celebrating , as was ProtagonistB . It was a moment of pure joy and happiness . 
The sky is blue and black and vast with the stars , but ProtagonistA is pale and yellow and ProtagonistA's light is dim , casting a yellowish tinge over the sea of stars which stands above the earth . ProtagonistA has been sick for a while now and ProtagonistA's friends are worried about ProtagonistA . They all gather around ProtagonistA one night , looking up at the sky and talking about old times . ProtagonistA is quiet and does n't say much , but ProtagonistA seems to be enjoying their company . Eventually , ProtagonistA's friends have to leave and they all say their goodbyes . ProtagonistA is left alone , but ProtagonistA 's not feeling so alone now . ProtagonistA looks up at the sky and sees the stars shining down on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA's friends will always be there for ProtagonistA , even if ProtagonistA ca n't always see them . 
ProtagonistA sat up all night , and thought about all the things ProtagonistA had seen . ProtagonistA had seen a lot in ProtagonistA's life , but nothing had prepared ProtagonistA for what ProtagonistA saw that night . ProtagonistA saw a creature , unlike anything ProtagonistA had ever seen before . It was big and green and had three eyes . ProtagonistA was so scared that ProtagonistA could n't move . The creature just stared at ProtagonistA and then went on its way . ProtagonistA was so shaken by what ProtagonistA had seen that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA just sat there all night , thinking about what ProtagonistA had seen . 
ProtagonistA had been on the ship for weeks , and was excited to finally be reaching their destination . However , shortly before they arrived , ProtagonistA became ill with cholera . ProtagonistB did everything ProtagonistB could , but ProtagonistA's condition continued to decline . With the ship anchored just a few miles from their destination , ProtagonistB made the difficult decision to leave ProtagonistA behind , in hopes that ProtagonistA would be able to get medical help on shore and save ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was left alone on the ship , with no way to get off . ProtagonistA quickly succumbed to the disease and died , never reaching ProtagonistA's destination . ProtagonistB no doubt felt guilty for the rest of ProtagonistB's life , knowing that ProtagonistB could have saved ProtagonistA but chose not to . ProtagonistA's death was a tragic reminder of the harsh realities of life at sea . 
One morning in October , 1890 , ProtagonistA came to the friend - house in the street called Beechmere Lane , with the sign over ProtagonistA's door :  No Visitors .  ProtagonistA's face was pale and ProtagonistA's eyes were red , as if ProtagonistA had been crying .  What is the matter , ProtagonistA ?  asked ProtagonistA's friend .  ProtagonistA have come to say good - bye ,  said ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA am going away .   Where are ProtagonistA going ?   ProtagonistA do n't know . ProtagonistA only know that ProtagonistA must go .   But why , ProtagonistA ? What has happened ?   ProtagonistA have seen things ,  said ProtagonistA ,  things that ProtagonistA can not explain . ProtagonistA have seen ghosts , and ProtagonistA have seen creatures that can not be of this world . ProtagonistA can not stay here any longer , ProtagonistA must go .   But where will ProtagonistA go , ProtagonistA ? What will ProtagonistA do ?   ProtagonistA will go into the world , and ProtagonistA will find a way to put an end to the things that ProtagonistA have seen . ProtagonistA will find a way to stop the ghosts and the creatures , and ProtagonistA will make the world safe again . That is what ProtagonistA must do .  And with that , ProtagonistA said goodbye and set off into the world to find a way to stop the ghosts and the creatures . 
ProtagonistA dropped ProtagonistA's bag of toys on the ground , looked up and saw a brick - and - mortar window with a two - foot - high gap in it . ProtagonistA could see the sunlight streaming in from the other side , and ProtagonistA could hear the laughter of children . It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA wanted to be on the other side of that window . ProtagonistA began to climb , and when ProtagonistA got to the top , ProtagonistA looked down and saw the ground far below . ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to jump . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and jumped . When ProtagonistA landed , ProtagonistA was on the other side of the window , and the children were cheering . ProtagonistA had made it ! 
ProtagonistA had been born , with all the tender feelings and memories which ProtagonistA could bear , ProtagonistA in the year of grace 1792 , to Louis the 15th of July , in the parish of St. dernier - sur - Marne , in the town of Port Omega , in the district of the Madonnier family . ProtagonistA had been the only child of ProtagonistA's parents , who were honest and hard - working people , and ProtagonistA had always been a good and obedient son . But when ProtagonistA was about sixteen years old , ProtagonistA's father died , and ProtagonistB , was obliged to take in lodgers to make ends meet . ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to help ProtagonistB , but it was hard for a boy of ProtagonistA's age to earn enough to keep them both . And so it happened that , when ProtagonistA was eighteen years old , ProtagonistA was obliged to go out into the world to seek ProtagonistA's fortune . 
ProtagonistA had been drinking with ProtagonistB all evening , and ProtagonistA had been told to go to bed early , for ProtagonistA was going to spend all night with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was excited to spend the night with ProtagonistB , as ProtagonistA had not seen ProtagonistB in many years . However , when ProtagonistA went to bed , ProtagonistB was already asleep . ProtagonistA tried to stay awake , but ProtagonistA eventually fell asleep . 
When ProtagonistA had finally finished reading the story aloud to the two children , ProtagonistA had gone over the whole thing again , and felt more than ever that ProtagonistA had gone astray , to the extreme extent of the past . ProtagonistA had been so caught up in the story that ProtagonistA had completely forgotten about the two children who were sitting in front of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt terrible now , and was sure that ProtagonistA had done them a great disservice . 
ProtagonistA was a blonde girl with long black hair , and while ProtagonistA knew it was only a possibility that ProtagonistA would one day be all of thirty - two , it did n't matter . The life ProtagonistA had now was perfect , and ProtagonistA was content to live it out as best ProtagonistA could . ProtagonistA had a great job , a loving family , and ProtagonistB . What more could ProtagonistA ask for?As ProtagonistA's birthday approached , ProtagonistA began to feel a sense of dread . ProtagonistA knew that once ProtagonistA turned thirty - two , ProtagonistA's life would change . ProtagonistA would no longer be the carefree young man ProtagonistA was now . ProtagonistA would have to take on more responsibility , and ProtagonistA would have to start thinking about the future . It was a lot to take in , and ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA was ready for it . On the day of ProtagonistA's birthday , ProtagonistA woke up feeling nervous . ProtagonistA had a feeling that something was going to happen , but ProtagonistA did n't know what . ProtagonistA went about ProtagonistA's day as usual , trying to push the feeling out of ProtagonistA's mind . Later that day , ProtagonistB called ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB sounded upset , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had something to tell ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's heart sank . ProtagonistA knew what was coming . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was pregnant . ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA did n't know what to say . ProtagonistA was happy , but ProtagonistA was also scared . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's life was about to change forever . 
There was once in a certain country , ProtagonistA , and was of opinion that ProtagonistA had great moral and intellectual advantages , in comparison with ProtagonistA's neighbours , that ProtagonistA might best enjoy them , by treating them with the greatest civilities , and most affability . 
ProtagonistA 's coming . ProtagonistA 's coming ! I can hear ProtagonistA's footsteps on the stairs . ProtagonistA 's coming to get me . I 'm so scared . I do n't know what to do . I hide under the bed . I see ProtagonistA's feet walking around the room . ProtagonistA 's looking for me . I 'm so scared . I do n't know what to do . I 'm shaking . I 'm so scared . I hear ProtagonistA coming closer . I see ProtagonistA's feet under the bed . ProtagonistA 's coming for me . I 'm so scared . I do n't know what to do . I 'm shaking . I 'm so scared . I 'm going to die . 
ProtagonistA was seated on the steps of the throne in the center of the court , ProtagonistA's face pale and ProtagonistA's eyes trembling as ProtagonistA looked down at the golden blade of Agredite in the hands of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that this was the only way to save ProtagonistA's kingdom from the invading army , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like ProtagonistA was signing ProtagonistA's own death warrant . ProtagonistB , looked at ProtagonistA with a mix of pity and resolve . ProtagonistB knew that this was n't what either of them wanted , but it was the only way to save their people . With a heavy heart , ProtagonistA agreed to the marriage and the two were we d . As they walked down the aisle , ProtagonistA could n't help but think of the life ProtagonistA could have had with someone else . But ProtagonistA knew that this was ProtagonistA's duty and ProtagonistA had to see it through . 
ProtagonistA was not having a good day . First , ProtagonistA got into a fight with ProtagonistC . Then , ProtagonistA's teacher scolded ProtagonistA in front of the whole class . And to top it all off , ProtagonistB came to visit . ProtagonistA will not we d you ,  said ProtagonistB , with ProtagonistA's tall , dark - haired face flaming red in a way that evoked a funeral pyre . ProtagonistA was so embarrassed and angry that ProtagonistA wanted to just crawl under a rock and die . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was only trying to help , but ProtagonistB's words just made ProtagonistA feel worse . Later that night , ProtagonistA talked to ProtagonistC and made up with ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA also apologized to ProtagonistA's teacher . As for ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA decided to just ignore ProtagonistB . After all , ProtagonistB did n't know anything about ProtagonistA's life . 
When ProtagonistA stepped to the lectern , ProtagonistB did not interrupt ProtagonistA's position . ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with a twinkle in ProtagonistB's eye , as if ProtagonistB knew something ProtagonistA did n't . ProtagonistA felt a sudden urge to confess all of ProtagonistA's secrets to ProtagonistB . Instead , ProtagonistA cleared ProtagonistA's throat and began ProtagonistA's speech . 
ProtagonistA had been walking the streets for days , ever since ProtagonistA ran away from home . ProtagonistA was 15 now , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could take on the world . ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was going or what ProtagonistA was going to do , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get away from ProtagonistA's abusive father . ProtagonistA had nowhere to go and no one to turn to . One day , as ProtagonistA was walking around aimlessly , ProtagonistA came across a strange looking building . It was old and run down , and it looked like it was about to collapse . But there was something about it that caught ProtagonistA's attention . ProtagonistA walked up to the door and peered inside . It was dark and dusty inside , but ProtagonistA could see a faint light in the distance . ProtagonistA walked towards the light , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized it was coming from a window . ProtagonistA climbed up to the window and looked inside . What ProtagonistA saw surprised ProtagonistA . It was a room , and it looked like it was from another time . ProtagonistA climbed through the window and into the room , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had been transported to another world . The room was filled with old furniture and dusty books , and it looked like it had n't been touched in years . But in the corner of the room , ProtagonistA saw a small bed . And on the bed , there was a sleeping child . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA did n't want to wake the child , but ProtagonistA did n't want to leave them alone in this strange place . ProtagonistA stood there for a moment , unsure of what to do . But then ProtagonistA heard a noise from outside the room . It sounded like someone was coming . ProtagonistA did n't want to be caught , so ProtagonistA quickly hid under the bed . ProtagonistA heard the door to the room open , and then ProtagonistA heard footsteps . Someone was walking around the room , and then they stopped at the bed . ProtagonistA held ProtagonistA's breath , hoping they would n't find ProtagonistA . But then ProtagonistA heard a voice . It was ProtagonistB's voice , and ProtagonistB sounded kind and gentle .  It 's okay , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA can come out . ProtagonistB wo n't hurt ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA slowly crawled out from under the bed and looked at ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was old , but ProtagonistB had a kind face .  Who are ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked . ProtagonistB name is Nightingale ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'm a witch . ProtagonistA did n't know what to say . ProtagonistA had never met a witch before .  What are ProtagonistB doing here ?  ProtagonistA asked . I'm here to help ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA 're in a lot of trouble , and ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB's help . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA could trust ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did n't have anywhere else to turn .  Okay ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'll do whatever ProtagonistB say . ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA .  Good ,  ProtagonistB said .  Now , let 's get ProtagonistA out of here .  
ProtagonistA was increasing in stature . ProtagonistA was a beautiful , cat - faced creature , but most people would admit that ProtagonistA was rather strange . ProtagonistA did n't care what people thought of ProtagonistA , though . ProtagonistA was content to live ProtagonistA's life in ProtagonistA's own way . One day , ProtagonistA decided to go on an adventure . ProtagonistA had always wanted to see the world , and now ProtagonistA had the chance . ProtagonistA set off into the wide open world , and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA in some very strange places . ProtagonistA met all sorts of creatures on ProtagonistA's journey , and ProtagonistA had many adventures . ProtagonistA even met a dragon ! But in the end , ProtagonistA always found ProtagonistA's way back home . ProtagonistA was happy to have seen the world , but ProtagonistA was just as happy to be home again . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would always have a place in ProtagonistA's heart for adventure , but ProtagonistA was content to live ProtagonistA's life in ProtagonistA's own strange way . 
ProtagonistA's name was Lucy , and ProtagonistA was just seventeen when we first met . We met at a party and hit it off immediately . We were both outgoing and loved to have fun . We dated for a year and then broke up . We remained friends , and would often go out together in a group . A few years later , we ran into each other again and started dating . We were both in our early twenties and things were different this time around . We were both more mature and serious . We got married a year later and have been happily married ever since . 
ProtagonistA had been living in the deep for as long as ProtagonistA could remember . It was a peaceful place , filled with the fragrance of flowers and the fragrance of the wind . ProtagonistA's home was a small nook of earth and air , and ProtagonistA was content . One day , ProtagonistA ventured out of the deep and into the world above . ProtagonistA was curious about what else was out there , and ProtagonistA wanted to see it for ProtagonistA . The world above was very different from the deep . There was so much noise and commotion . ProtagonistA did n't like it at all . ProtagonistA missed the peace and quiet of the deep . After a while , ProtagonistA decided to venture back home . ProtagonistA was glad to be back in the deep , where ProtagonistA belonged . 
On that snowy morning in March , ProtagonistA was walking through the great halls of the castle at the summit of a vast and summaing mount , when ProtagonistA came face to face with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was dressed in a long , flowing robe of crimson and gold , and ProtagonistB's white hair was piled high upon ProtagonistB's head in an intricate arrangement of curls and braids . ProtagonistB was seated in a great throne of carved wood and gilt , and ProtagonistB's hands rested upon the arms of the throne . ProtagonistB regarded ProtagonistA with a piercing gaze , and ProtagonistA felt as if ProtagonistB could see into ProtagonistA's very soul . Who are ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked , ProtagonistB's voice quivering with age but still commanding . I - I'm Bob , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA replied , bowing low . And what brings ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB's castle on this cold day?I - I'm lost , ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was out walking in the forest and ProtagonistA got turned around . ProtagonistA did n't mean to trespass , ProtagonistA swear . ProtagonistB regarded ProtagonistA for a moment , and then ProtagonistB beckoned ProtagonistA closer .  Come sit by the fire , ProtagonistA , and warm ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA must be cold after ProtagonistA's journey . ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA walked forward and seated ProtagonistA in a chair by the fire . ProtagonistB leaned forward , and ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB's eyes were filled with wisdom and compassion . There are many paths through the forest , ProtagonistA , and it is easy to get lost . But if ProtagonistA are lost , all ProtagonistA need to do is ask for directions . Someone will always be happy to help ProtagonistA find ProtagonistA's way . ProtagonistA nodded , and ProtagonistA felt a warmth spreading through ProtagonistA , not just from the fire but from ProtagonistB's words . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB's advice , and ProtagonistA would always be grateful for ProtagonistB's kindness . 
On the night of the triumph of God , when the clouds of the tempest were in their most profuse motion , ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's womb , and bearing a son , whose name was John , uttered a pious prayer to St. Fritigern , the King of Germany ; and said , ProtagonistC , according to the divine will , ProtagonistB am now at liberty to choose the mode which most properly belongs to ProtagonistB ; in which , according to ProtagonistC's minds and ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB shall be able to establish ProtagonistB's religion ; and for this purpose ProtagonistB beg leave to make ascertainment of the manner in which ProtagonistB shall assemble ProtagonistB's companions in this city . 
ProtagonistA had been in the hospital for a week , and ProtagonistA was getting antsy . ProtagonistA was bored of the white walls and the constant beeping of the machines . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's home and ProtagonistA's family . ProtagonistA missed the comfort of ProtagonistA's own bed . Across the way from ProtagonistA's hospital bed , ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistA's house . It looked so close , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't go home yet . ProtagonistA had to wait until the doctors said ProtagonistA was better . ProtagonistA sighed and turned ProtagonistA's head to the window , watching the birds fly by . ProtagonistA hoped that ProtagonistA would be able to go home soon . 
ProtagonistA was a well - built , long - legged , very pretty , pretty girl with a certain childlike air of innocence about ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always cheerful and happy , and ProtagonistA had a way of making everyone around ProtagonistA feel the same way . Even when ProtagonistA was upset , ProtagonistA never took it out on others . ProtagonistA was the kind of person who made you feel good just by being around ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA considered ProtagonistA the luckiest man alive . ProtagonistA had a beautiful wife , two healthy children , and a great job . ProtagonistA was always grateful for ProtagonistA's blessings , and ProtagonistA tried to make the most of every day . One day , ProtagonistA's luck ran out . ProtagonistA was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's days were numbered . ProtagonistA was determined to make the most of the time ProtagonistA had left . ProtagonistA spent as much time as possible with ProtagonistA's family and friends , and ProtagonistA tried to live each day to the fullest . ProtagonistA's positive attitude and grateful heart touched everyone who knew ProtagonistA . Even in the face of death , ProtagonistA considered ProtagonistA the luckiest man alive . 
It was a beautiful good day in October when ProtagonistA trod into the garden and saw ProtagonistB . The sun was shining and the leaves were falling gently from the trees . ProtagonistB was sitting on a bench , reading a book . ProtagonistB looked up as ProtagonistA approached . Hello , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said , smiling .  It 's a beautiful day , is n't it?Yes , it is ,  ProtagonistA replied . ProtagonistA sat down on the bench next to ProtagonistB .  What are ProtagonistB reading?Oh , just a book ,  ProtagonistB said , showing ProtagonistA the cover .  It 's a romance novel . ProtagonistB love these kinds of books . I can see that ,  ProtagonistA said , chuckling . ProtagonistA leaned back and enjoyed the good weather and the company of ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA had been in ProtagonistA's cell for two days now , and ProtagonistA was starting to go stir crazy . ProtagonistA had been lying in ProtagonistA's bed for hours , just staring at the ceiling and thinking about ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had made some bad choices , but ProtagonistA never thought ProtagonistA would end up in prison . ProtagonistA had been a drug addict for years , and ProtagonistA had been in and out of rehab multiple times . ProtagonistA had stolen to support ProtagonistA's habit , and ProtagonistA had even hurt people when ProtagonistA was high . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA deserved to be in prison , but ProtagonistA still could n't help but feel sorry for ProtagonistA . On the second day of ProtagonistA's incarceration , ProtagonistA could n't bear to get up from the bed that ProtagonistA had been lying on for hours . ProtagonistA stayed in ProtagonistA's room for a few minutes , and then , without saying a word , ProtagonistA took one last deep breath and , as if nothing happened , let ProtagonistA go . ProtagonistA's body was found by the guards later that day . ProtagonistA had hanged ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's bed sheets . ProtagonistA was just another casualty of the war on drugs . 
The moon is ProtagonistA's friend , and ProtagonistA is nothing without it . ProtagonistA is a lonely man who lives in a small town . ProtagonistA works at the local grocery store and does n't have many friends . The only thing that brings ProtagonistA joy is the moon . Every night , ProtagonistA goes outside and talks to the moon . ProtagonistA tells it about ProtagonistA's day and how ProtagonistA 's feeling . The moon is the only one who understands ProtagonistA . Without it , ProtagonistA would be lost . 
In the year 1853 , ProtagonistA was induced to put a lock of ProtagonistA's hair on ProtagonistA's head ; and , while the ambassador but little doubted that ProtagonistA was well acted , yet ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA plainly and unmistakably perceived to be interested in the matter , which , however , ProtagonistA had never before encountered in ProtagonistA's life , and which ProtagonistA had never dreamed of any way , before that time , having , in fact no conception of the end or purpose of the conduct of ProtagonistA's affairs , been deceived into believing that they were spent , or that they were in proper hands . 
ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the undead . As a child , ProtagonistA would sneak into graveyards to watch the zombies lurch around . ProtagonistA read every book ProtagonistA could find on the subject , and even experimented with raising the dead ProtagonistA , though never with any success . One day , ProtagonistA came across an ancient text that claimed to hold the secret to raising the dead . The instructions were vague , but ProtagonistA was determined to try it . ProtagonistA gathered the necessary ingredients and performed the ritual . To ProtagonistA's amazement , it actually worked ! ProtagonistA had raised ProtagonistA's first zombie . ProtagonistA was overjoyed at ProtagonistA's success , but ProtagonistA's joy was short - lived . The zombie was uncontrollable , and soon ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA under attack . ProtagonistA barely managed to escape with ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA realized then that raising the dead was not something to be taken lightly . ProtagonistA vowed to never do it again , and to keep the secret to ProtagonistA . 
At the turn of the last century , when Europe was drifting apart , there lived ProtagonistA , and by the name of Caroline Caroline , or Caroline of Mary , ProtagonistA was called . ProtagonistA was a young man of twenty , with ProtagonistB and two small children . ProtagonistA worked in a factory in Manchester , and ProtagonistB worked as a maid in a large house in London . They were both happy in their work , and their life was comfortable and contented . One day , ProtagonistA was walking home from work , when ProtagonistA saw a group of men standing on the corner , talking and laughing . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that they were talking about a new war that was starting in Europe . ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA had never thought about war before , and ProtagonistA could n't imagine why anyone would want to fight . The next day , ProtagonistA went to work as usual , but ProtagonistA could n't concentrate . All ProtagonistA could think about was the war . ProtagonistA wondered what it would be like , and if ProtagonistA would ever see ProtagonistA's family again . A few days later , ProtagonistA's factory was closed down , and ProtagonistA was out of work . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA had no money , and no way to support ProtagonistA's family . Then , one day , ProtagonistA saw a poster advertising for soldiers to fight in the war . ProtagonistA knew that it was ProtagonistA's duty to fight for ProtagonistA's country , and ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA could make some money to support ProtagonistA's family . ProtagonistA enlisted in the army , and ProtagonistA was sent to France to fight . ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA was also excited . ProtagonistA was going to be a hero . ProtagonistA fought in many battles , and ProtagonistA was wounded several times . But ProtagonistA never gave up , and ProtagonistA never stopped fighting . Eventually , the war ended , and ProtagonistA came home . ProtagonistA was a different man now . ProtagonistA had seen things that ProtagonistA could never have imagined , and ProtagonistA had done things that ProtagonistA never thought ProtagonistA would do . But ProtagonistA was also a hero , and ProtagonistA was proud of what ProtagonistA had done . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB lived happily ever after , and they never forgot the war . They would always remember the friends that they had lost , and the sacrifices that they had made . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bright kid , but for some reason , ProtagonistA just could n't seem to get good grades in school . ProtagonistA's parents had always pushed ProtagonistA to go to college , but ProtagonistA was afraid that if ProtagonistA did , people would think ProtagonistA was dumb . So , instead , ProtagonistA decided to get a job and make a life for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's decision , and ProtagonistA did n't let what other people thought of ProtagonistA bother ProtagonistA . 
The day after ProtagonistA's engagement as an actress , ProtagonistA had a severe headache , and had to walk at all hours . ProtagonistA was so excited to be getting married , and to be an actress , that ProtagonistA did n't mind the pain . ProtagonistA was just happy to be alive and to be able to share ProtagonistA's life with someone ProtagonistA loved . 
There is no such thing as ProtagonistA , but there is a pricetag which is often a price - tag of the costume which ProtagonistA wears . ProtagonistA is a character who is often seen at Halloween parties or other events where people dress up in costumes . ProtagonistA is usually wearing a costume that is very unique and often has a lot of detail . The pricetag is often the only thing that people can see when they look at ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was walking home from work when ProtagonistA noticed a strange light in the sky . It was getting closer and closer , and soon it was right above ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA could see a figure inside the light , and it was speaking to ProtagonistA . The figure told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was chosen to be the saviour of the world . ProtagonistA was given a special mission to complete , and ProtagonistA would be given the power to do it . ProtagonistA was n't sure what to believe , but ProtagonistA knew that this was something ProtagonistA had to do . The figure gave ProtagonistA a sword and told ProtagonistA to go to the nearest city . There ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was to defeat ProtagonistB and free the city . ProtagonistA took the sword and set off on ProtagonistA's journey . ProtagonistA had never felt so alive before . With every step ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's power growing . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could do anything . When ProtagonistA arrived in the city , ProtagonistA could see the fear in the people 's eyes . ProtagonistB was a powerful man , and no one had been able to stop ProtagonistB . But ProtagonistA was different . ProtagonistA had the power to defeat ProtagonistB . And ProtagonistA did . The city was saved and the people were free . ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's purpose in life . ProtagonistA was the chosen one , and ProtagonistA would never give up . 
ProtagonistA's father always had a lot of books in his bedroom . When ProtagonistA was seven and ProtagonistA had nothing to do , ProtagonistA sat down on the floor and started reading one of them . ProtagonistA held the pages up against the light and started reading . The light has never been the same since . 
The sun was up on this day ; the moon was bright and ProtagonistA sprang out of ProtagonistA's perch with a great voice .  It 's time to wake up , sleepy head !  ProtagonistA called to the world below .  There 's a new day to explore and adventure awaits !  ProtagonistA was always the first one up in the morning , eager to start the day . ProtagonistA would always try to get everyone else up and moving too .  Come on , let 's go !  ProtagonistA would say .  The day is waiting for us !  
ProtagonistA was sitting on the veranda of the front door with ProtagonistA's hands on the knob . It was a hot day and the sun was beating down on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was sweating and ProtagonistA's shirt was sticking to ProtagonistA's back . ProtagonistA was about to go inside when ProtagonistA heard a noise . It sounded like someone was crying . ProtagonistA got up and looked around . ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on the ground with ProtagonistB's head in ProtagonistB's hands . ProtagonistA went over to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what was wrong . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB's husband had left ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB was all alone . ProtagonistA felt sorry for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA invited ProtagonistB inside . ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB a glass of water and a seat on the couch . ProtagonistA sat down next to ProtagonistB and they talked for a while . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistB was welcome to stay with ProtagonistA as long as ProtagonistB needed . 
ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA were a family of only two children . They both fell sick with an acute hope of death . ProtagonistA was awaiting the publication of ProtagonistA's work , which was entitled A History of the World . ProtagonistA determined to devote to the study of it all that was worthy of ProtagonistA's mind and to the satisfaction of the human race . ProtagonistB , on the other hand , was consumed with great apprehensions . ProtagonistB was afraid that the world would end before ProtagonistB had a chance to see it . ProtagonistA reassured ProtagonistB that the world would go on long after they were gone . ProtagonistA promised to write a history of it so that ProtagonistB could understand it . ProtagonistB was comforted by this and died peacefully . 
ProtagonistA was having a tough day . First ProtagonistA's alarm clock had n't gone off , so ProtagonistA was late for work . Then ProtagonistA's boss had given ProtagonistA a hard time about a project ProtagonistA was working on . And to top it all off , ProtagonistA's favorite coffee shop was out of the flavored coffee ProtagonistA liked . So , when ProtagonistA got home from work , ProtagonistA was in no mood to talk to anyone . ProtagonistA just wanted to relax and forget about ProtagonistA's day . ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's room and plopped down on ProtagonistA's bed . ProtagonistA reached for ProtagonistA's Bible , which was always nearby , and began to flip through the pages . ProtagonistA stopped when ProtagonistA got to a section about birds . ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by birds and their ability to fly . ProtagonistA read through the section , letting ProtagonistA's mind wander . Before long , ProtagonistA started to feel better . The troubles of ProtagonistA's day seemed to fade away as ProtagonistA thought about the beauty of birds . ProtagonistA even began to smile as ProtagonistA imagined ProtagonistA flying high above the world . 
ProtagonistA sits cross - legged on the floor of the dark alcove , ProtagonistA's fingers tracing the lines of a small painting . In the painting , ProtagonistB is standing in a field of flowers , ProtagonistB's arms outstretched . The sun is setting behind ProtagonistB , and the sky is a deep , rich blue . ProtagonistA feels a sense of peace and calm whenever ProtagonistA looks at the painting , and ProtagonistA 's been coming to this alcove to look at it every day for the past week . today , as ProtagonistA looks at the painting , ProtagonistA notices something new . There 's a small figure in the background , just to the left of ProtagonistB . It 's a child , ProtagonistA realizes , and they 're reaching out to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA ca n't help but smile at the image , and ProtagonistA feels ProtagonistA's heart fill with warmth . It 's as if the painting is telling ProtagonistA that everything is going to be alright . 
I see ProtagonistA's Rolls - Royce parked beside my school , said ProtagonistA's father , and ProtagonistA's fancy - picture - tiles on the mantelpiece , and ProtagonistA's clapboard in the corner . I bet ProtagonistA 's doing better than me , the old man said , shaking his head . I see ProtagonistA's life and I just do n't understand it . 
ProtagonistA had been partially drowned when ProtagonistA climbed into the water of the ship , to which ProtagonistA had belonged for some years , and which had been ProtagonistA's home . ProtagonistA had been on the ship for so long that ProtagonistA had forgotten how to swim , and when ProtagonistA climbed into the water ProtagonistA quickly began to sink . Fortunately , ProtagonistA was rescued by one of ProtagonistA's shipmates and was revived . ProtagonistA was very lucky to have been rescued , and ProtagonistA vowed to never forget how to swim again . 
ProtagonistA had been looking forward to this day for months . ProtagonistA had been invited to the home of ProtagonistB . This was a huge honor , and ProtagonistA wanted to make a good impression . ProtagonistA spent the morning getting dressed and making sure everything was perfect . ProtagonistA did n't want to make any mistakes . When it was finally time to leave , ProtagonistA took a deep breath and walked out the door . ProtagonistB was very impressed with ProtagonistA . They talked for hours about all sorts of things . ProtagonistA was so excited to be there that ProtagonistA did n't even notice the time passing . Before ProtagonistA knew it , it was time to go . ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for coming and said ProtagonistB hoped to see ProtagonistA again soon . ProtagonistA was absolutely thrilled . This was the best day of ProtagonistA's life . 
ProtagonistA was always a bit of an oddball . ProtagonistA's facial features , eye color , and body were all different from the rest of the family . But that did n't stop ProtagonistB from loving ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's facial features , ProtagonistA's eye color , and ProtagonistA's body , said ProtagonistB , are all different . But that 's what makes ProtagonistA special . My father always saw the best in people , and ProtagonistB was always quick to forgive . That 's why ProtagonistA was like a son to ProtagonistB . Even though ProtagonistA was different , ProtagonistA was always happy and always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA was always quick to make friends and was always the life of the party . ProtagonistA was always there for ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB needed someone to talk to . And ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA needed a shoulder to cry on . They say that blood is thicker than water . But in ProtagonistB's case , love was thicker than blood . 
The whirling cloak of ProtagonistA slipped from ProtagonistA's fingers and into the arms of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB , had been fighting ProtagonistA for the cloak for hours . It was a magical cloak that would grant the wearer the power of flight . ProtagonistA had been using it to terrorize the villagers , but ProtagonistB had been determined to stop ProtagonistA . The final battle had been fierce , but ProtagonistB had finally triumphed . As ProtagonistB stood there , clutching the cloak to ProtagonistB's chest , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB had to use it to save the village . ProtagonistB flew into the air , ProtagonistA's screams of rage following ProtagonistB , and began to drop the cloak down to the villagers below . With the cloak , they would be able to escape ProtagonistA's tyranny and build a new life for themselves . ProtagonistB flew back to the village , a sense of pride and satisfaction swelling in ProtagonistB's chest . ProtagonistB had saved them all . 
ProtagonistA had been thinking all night and ProtagonistA 'd been stumped ever since . ProtagonistA just could n't figure out what to get ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's birthday . ProtagonistA thought and thought , but nothing came to mind . ProtagonistA was starting to get frustrated . ProtagonistA got up from the table and paced around the room . Maybe ProtagonistA could go for a walk and clear ProtagonistA's head . That 's when ProtagonistA had an idea . ProtagonistA could get ProtagonistB a gift certificate to ProtagonistB's favorite store . ProtagonistB would love that . ProtagonistA was so happy with ProtagonistA's idea that ProtagonistA went to the store right away and got the certificate . ProtagonistB was thrilled with ProtagonistB's present . 
ProtagonistA had driven for an entire day , and a whole day 's sleep , and had done nothing of note save to be driven to the place ProtagonistA was going to be raped . When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA was met by ProtagonistA's attacker , who proceeded to rape ProtagonistA . Afterwards , ProtagonistA drove home , still in a state of shock . ProtagonistA had never been raped before , and did n't know how to process what had happened to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was scared , and felt violated . It was a nightmare that ProtagonistA would never forget . 
ProtagonistA had been very wrong in ProtagonistA's belief that I would ever be with anyone , or marry anyone . ProtagonistA had seen me with many different men over the years , and I had never been serious with any of them . I was always the one who was moving on to the next guy , never looking back . ProtagonistA just assumed that I would never settle down . But then I met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was different than any other guy I had ever been with . I actually felt like I could see a future with ProtagonistB . We started dating seriously and then we got married . ProtagonistA was at our wedding and ProtagonistA was happy for me , even though ProtagonistA had been wrong about me . 
ProtagonistA was sitting ProtagonistA's typewriter down on the table in front of ProtagonistA , studying the words typed on the screen . ProtagonistA had been working on this piece for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to see some progress . But now , as ProtagonistA looked at the words on the screen , ProtagonistA was n't so sure . Was this really the best ProtagonistA could do?He sighed and leaned back in ProtagonistA's chair , running a hand through ProtagonistA's hair . ProtagonistA was getting nowhere with this . Maybe it was time to give up and start fresh with something new . But then ProtagonistA thought about all the work ProtagonistA had put into this piece . ProtagonistA could n't just give up now . ProtagonistA had to see it through . With a new determination , ProtagonistA sat back down at the typewriter and started to work . The words flowed easier now , and ProtagonistA soon forgot about ProtagonistA's doubts . This was ProtagonistA's piece , and ProtagonistA was going to see it through to the end . 
ProtagonistA was out for a walk in the woods when ProtagonistA came across a bush . On the bush was a turnip , and on the turnip was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had never seen ProtagonistB before , but ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB somewhere before . ProtagonistB spoke to ProtagonistA and asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was doing in the woods . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA was out for a walk and enjoying the nature . ProtagonistB then asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA wanted to play a game . ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but then ProtagonistA agreed . The game was simple . ProtagonistB would ask ProtagonistA a question , and if ProtagonistA answered correctly , ProtagonistA would get a point . If ProtagonistA answered incorrectly , ProtagonistB would get a point . The first person to five points would win . ProtagonistA went first . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB's name was . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's name was Tim . ProtagonistA then asked ProtagonistB where ProtagonistB lived . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB lived in the woods . ProtagonistA was about to ask another question when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had won the game . 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the shadow of the building , and ProtagonistA's eyes had the kind of serenity of a few hours spent in a convincing dream . The sun was setting , and the sky was a beautiful orange . ProtagonistA felt at peace . ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately and ProtagonistA needed this moment to just relax and clear ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and took a deep breath . 
ProtagonistA had a habit of making a speech with all the amazing clarity , propriety , and rationalism of a genius , and almost the same effect , when ProtagonistA had finished , as when ProtagonistA had finished ; for ProtagonistA was always going on about something , ever since ProtagonistA had heard it described to ProtagonistA . This time , ProtagonistA was going on about the time ProtagonistA had met ProtagonistB . It was the most amazing thing that has ever happened to ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA was just walking along , minding ProtagonistA's own business , when ProtagonistA came across a lamp . ProtagonistA picked it up and rubbed it , and out popped ProtagonistB . At first ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistB was really friendly . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would grant ProtagonistA three wishes . ProtagonistA did n't know what to wish for at first , but then ProtagonistA thought of the perfect thing . ProtagonistA wished that ProtagonistA could always make speeches like a genius . And , granted , ever since then ProtagonistA 've been able to do just that . ProtagonistA can stand up in front of any audience and just speak off the top of ProtagonistA's head , and they 'll all be hanging on ProtagonistA's every word . It 's been great , but there is one downside . Because ProtagonistA 'm always speaking like a genius , people expect ProtagonistA to be one . They expect ProtagonistA to be able to solve all their problems , and sometimes ProtagonistA just ca n't do that . But ProtagonistA guess that 's a price ProtagonistA 'm willing to pay for the ability to make amazing speeches .  
ProtagonistA has always considered ProtagonistA a bit of a ladies ' man . ProtagonistA 's never been one for settling down , but ProtagonistA 's always enjoyed the company of women . So , when ProtagonistA's friends started getting married , ProtagonistA was the first to say that ProtagonistA would never tie the knot . But , as ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA began to realize that maybe ProtagonistA was missing out on something . ProtagonistA started to see the appeal of having a wife and family of ProtagonistA's own . So , when ProtagonistA met the woman of ProtagonistA's dreams , ProtagonistA knew it was time to take the plunge . ProtagonistA proposed , and they were married within the year . ProtagonistA knows that this is the moment when ProtagonistA really begins to become the man ProtagonistA always wanted to be . 
They were sitting together on the leaden plank of the old boat , the aye , but not so long ago when the sailors were shivering in their hundreds , when the water was so deep that even the redskin boys were drowned in it ; when the sun was so low and the sky so black that the fires of the desert were almost out of breath , when the ship was so light that ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head in despair when ProtagonistA saw the captain in the middle of the night going beyond the windward deck , and instead of sinking , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA among the stars , drifting in space , with the power to move anything that ProtagonistA pleased in the universe . 
ProtagonistA has never been to the movies before , but ProtagonistA 's always been involved in them . ProtagonistA 's been a stuntman , a grip , a gaffer , and a best boy . ProtagonistA 's worked on big budget films and small independent films . ProtagonistA 's even been an extra a few times . But ProtagonistA 's never actually been to the movies . That all changed last night . ProtagonistA finally went to the movies . ProtagonistA saw a big blockbuster film on the big screen . And ProtagonistA loved it . ProtagonistA loved the experience of being in a dark theater with a huge screen . ProtagonistA loved the sound of the crowd around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA even loved the smell of the popcorn . It was everything ProtagonistA thought it would be and more . ProtagonistA ca n't wait to go back and see more movies . 
There was once ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had no money for food or shelter , so ProtagonistA lived on the streets . One day , ProtagonistA came across a rich man who was willing to help ProtagonistA . The rich man gave ProtagonistA a job and a place to stay . ProtagonistA was very grateful and worked hard for the rich man . Over time , ProtagonistA became very successful and was able to help other poor people . 
ProtagonistA was sailing to San Diego , California in a boat which ProtagonistA called the Lusitania . ProtagonistA was looking forward to a private audience with the rich and famous and was particularly delighted at the prospect . Unfortunately , ProtagonistA's boat was shipwrecked and ProtagonistA was the only survivor . ProtagonistA managed to make it to shore , but was severely injured . ProtagonistA was found by a passing motorist and taken to the hospital , where ProtagonistA eventually recovered . ProtagonistA was never able to fulfill ProtagonistA's dream of meeting the rich and famous , but ProtagonistA was grateful to be alive . 
ProtagonistA ran with alacrity through several miles of fields , forests , and meadows , bearing with ProtagonistA the great stuff of life : the apple , the bramble , the cherry - tree , the thorn - trees , and so many trees , some two hundred yards in circumference . All the while , ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistA's life back home and how much it had changed since ProtagonistA 'd left . It seemed like a lifetime ago , but it had only been a few short years . He'd left home in search of adventure and ProtagonistA 'd certainly found it . ProtagonistA 'd seen more of the world than ProtagonistA ever could have imagined and ProtagonistA 'd made friends in places ProtagonistA never would have thought possible . But now , as ProtagonistA ran through the woods , ProtagonistA felt a longing for home . ProtagonistA missed the simplicity of ProtagonistA's life back there . ProtagonistA missed the way things had been before ProtagonistA 'd left . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's family and ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA even missed the apple tree in ProtagonistA's backyard . But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't go back . ProtagonistA had to keep moving forward . ProtagonistA had to keep exploring . There was still so much of the world to see and ProtagonistA did n't want to miss a single thing . So ProtagonistA ran on , through the fields and the forests and the meadows , bearing with ProtagonistA the great stuff of life . And ProtagonistA vowed to never forget the lessons ProtagonistA 'd learned on ProtagonistA's journey . 
In the beginning was a star , the same star which , in the beginning , ProtagonistA made , the shell of which ProtagonistA fashioned into four parts , the golden - headed , the blue - eyed , the bright - eyed , the yellow - eyed , and the red - eyed . The golden - headed part ProtagonistA called the Sun , the blue - eyed part ProtagonistA called the Moon , the bright - eyed part ProtagonistA called the Stars , and the yellow - eyed part ProtagonistA called the Earth . The red - eyed part ProtagonistA called the Fire , and it was this part which gave light and life to the others . 
ProtagonistA had been feeling off for a few weeks . ProtagonistA was tired all the time and just did n't have the energy ProtagonistA used to . ProtagonistA was also having a lot of trouble remembering things . ProtagonistA finally decided to go to the doctor to see what was going on . The doctor did a bunch of tests and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was showing signs of dementia . ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA was only in ProtagonistA's early 60s . The doctor told ProtagonistA that there was no cure for dementia , but there were ways to slow its progression . ProtagonistA was heartbroken . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's life was going to change drastically . ProtagonistA would have to give up driving , and ProtagonistA would need help with day - to - day tasks . ProtagonistA would have to rely on ProtagonistA's family and friends to help ProtagonistA through this difficult time . 
Once upon a time , in a deep , dark corner of the universe , there was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was a very old , very fat king . ProtagonistA lived in a huge castle made of stone , and ProtagonistA had a pet dragon named Spike . ProtagonistA was a very lazy king , and ProtagonistA spent most of ProtagonistA's days eating and sleeping . One day , ProtagonistA's lazy lifestyle caught up with ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA had a heart attack . ProtagonistA was rushed to the hospital , but it was too late . ProtagonistA died , and ProtagonistA's kingdom fell into chaos . 
ProtagonistA was well past the age of twenty when ProtagonistA found the way to hell . ProtagonistA had been searching for it for years , ever since ProtagonistA had first heard the stories about the place . And now , finally , ProtagonistA had found it . The entrance was hidden in a cave , and it was guarded by a huge , ferocious - looking creature . But ProtagonistA was not afraid . ProtagonistA had come too far to turn back now . ProtagonistA was going to find out what was down there , no matter what . So ProtagonistA bravely stepped forward and entered the cave . Immediately , ProtagonistA was plunged into darkness . ProtagonistA could n't see a thing , but ProtagonistA could hear the creature coming after ProtagonistA . It was getting closer and closer , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die . But then , just when it seemed like the end was near , ProtagonistA saw a light . It was coming from a door at the end of the cave . ProtagonistA ran towards it , and the creature gave chase . But ProtagonistA was faster , and ProtagonistA made it to the door . ProtagonistA opened it and stepped through , into the light . And that 's when ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in hell . 
ProtagonistA was in a large room on the first floor . ProtagonistB had planned to put ProtagonistA in the interests of peace , but ProtagonistB decided not to leave ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was happy to be left alone in the room and ProtagonistA soon fell asleep . 
ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's short life . ProtagonistA 'd seen friends and loved ones killed , ProtagonistA 'd been tortured and ProtagonistA 'd been on the run . ProtagonistA was only twenty - two , but ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA 'd lived a lifetime . Now , ProtagonistA was being given an ultimatum . ProtagonistA could either go it alone , or ProtagonistA could expose the real source of the calamity ProtagonistA was involved in . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . If ProtagonistA went it alone , ProtagonistA would be risking ProtagonistA's life . But if ProtagonistA exposed the source of the calamity , ProtagonistA would be risking the lives of others . ProtagonistA did n't want to make the wrong decision , but ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA thought about it for a long time , but ProtagonistA could n't come to a decision . In the end , ProtagonistA decided to go it alone . ProtagonistA knew it was risky , but ProtagonistA felt like it was the right thing to do . ProtagonistA went on to have a long and successful career , exposing the real source of the calamity and helping others to avoid the same fate . ProtagonistA was a hero , and ProtagonistA never forgot the decision ProtagonistA made when ProtagonistA was twenty - two . 
ProtagonistA has been working in the fields of London for a very long time , and of all the police officers here , to which ProtagonistA belongs , none , neither male nor female , is a match for anybody else . ProtagonistA 's the best of the best , and ProtagonistA's skills are unmatched . But , one day , ProtagonistA meets ProtagonistA's match . 
I once had a story of ProtagonistA . When ProtagonistA was five , ProtagonistA started to grow ProtagonistA's hair out , because ProtagonistA wanted to be a pop star . ProtagonistA was always the tallest in ProtagonistA's class , and ProtagonistA loved it . When ProtagonistA turned six , ProtagonistA started to grow out ProtagonistA's nails , and ProtagonistA painted them with bright colors . ProtagonistA was always the center of attention , and ProtagonistA loved it . One day , ProtagonistA went to a party with ProtagonistA's friends , and ProtagonistA was the only one who was wearing a dress . ProtagonistA felt like a princess , and ProtagonistA loved it . 
ProtagonistA was walking through town on the left hand side of the road when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA stopped and stared for a moment . ProtagonistB noticed ProtagonistA staring and gave ProtagonistA a dirty look before walking away . ProtagonistA was so confused and curious that ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB for a few blocks until ProtagonistB turned down an alleyway . ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then decided to follow ProtagonistB . When ProtagonistA turned down the alley , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB talking to a man in the shadows . They seemed to be arguing about something , but ProtagonistA could n't hear what they were saying . ProtagonistB suddenly turned and saw ProtagonistA watching them . ProtagonistB said something to the man and then started walking towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was so scared that ProtagonistA turned and ran the other way . ProtagonistA did n't stop running until ProtagonistA got home . ProtagonistA was so breathless and panting that ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA what was wrong . ProtagonistA tried to tell ProtagonistC about ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was so shaken up that ProtagonistA could n't get the words out . ProtagonistC just hugged ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA it was okay . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB's face . It was so strange and haunting . 
There was once ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a very average looking guy , with brown hair and brown eyes . ProtagonistA worked in an office and lived in a small apartment . One day , ProtagonistA decided to make a change in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's job , sold ProtagonistA's apartment , and bought a one - way ticket to Europe . ProtagonistA had always dreamed of traveling the world , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to do it . ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going to go or what ProtagonistA was going to do , but ProtagonistA was excited for the adventure . ProtagonistA backpack and set off on ProtagonistA's journey . ProtagonistA started in France , and then made ProtagonistA's way to Italy , Spain , and Portugal . ProtagonistA visited famous landmarks and ate delicious food . ProtagonistA met new people and made new friends . ProtagonistA had the time of ProtagonistA's life . After a few months , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA did n't want to go home . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's new life and ProtagonistA did n't want to leave it . So , ProtagonistA decided to stay in Europe and make a new life for ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had been in prison for years , and ProtagonistA was getting tired of it . Every day was the same , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA was going crazy . ProtagonistA had tried to escape a few times , but it never worked . One day , ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's cell , wondering if there was anything left for ProtagonistA in the world . ProtagonistA was getting old , and ProtagonistA did n't know how much longer ProtagonistA could take it . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise outside ProtagonistA's cell . ProtagonistA got up to see what it was , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB coming towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB have some bad news . The warden wants to see ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew what that meant . ProtagonistA was going to be executed . ProtagonistA had heard of prisoners being executed before , and ProtagonistA did n't want to die . ProtagonistA begged ProtagonistB to let ProtagonistA go , but ProtagonistB just laughed and said ,  Sorry , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 're going to have to face the consequences of ProtagonistA's actions . ProtagonistA was led to the execution chamber , and ProtagonistA saw the electric chair . ProtagonistA knew that was going to be ProtagonistA's fate . ProtagonistA was strapped into the chair , and the last thing ProtagonistA heard was ProtagonistB saying ,  Sleeping is a bitch , said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistB opened the door of ProtagonistA's old , badly needed and ragged cell .  
And then there was ProtagonistA , and it was as if ProtagonistA had been born with a soul , and it was as if ProtagonistA had been born to be a dead man , and it was as though ProtagonistA had been born in the middle of the desert , and it was as though ProtagonistA had been born in the dead of winter , and it was as though ProtagonistA had been born in a small town , and as though ProtagonistA had been born in a small , crowded town , and it had been only twelve here , and there was a full moon , and it had been fenced off and a total of sixty - four people , and no one knew , and nobody was quite sure what the password was , and it did not make any difference , because nobody had ever had the misfortune of knowing what the password was , and nobody had ever going to be a million times as smart as ProtagonistA was , and nobody was n't quite sure how they got into the place , and nobody was quite sure how they started , and nobody had ever known , and nobody had ever really known , and theory was as cold as theory , and theory was what had , as far as anybody was concerned , taken the place of practice ; and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and . 
ProtagonistA was sitting at the table , listening to the conversation around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was in the most northeasterly part of the state of Maine and it was the summer of 1763 . ProtagonistA heard two men talking about the summer solstice . One man said that it was the first day of summer . The other man said that it was the longest day of the year . ProtagonistA was curious about what they were talking about . ProtagonistA asked them what the summer solstice was . The first man explained that it was the day when the sun was at its highest point in the sky . The second man explained that it was the longest day of the year because the sun stayed in the sky longer than any other day . ProtagonistA was fascinated by what ProtagonistA had learned and ProtagonistA thanked the men for their help . 
When ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's seventies , ProtagonistA was walking ProtagonistA's dog , Al - dolmane . Al - dolmane was a big , friendly dog who loved to walk and play . However , one day , while they were out walking , Al - dolmane suddenly stopped and refused to move . ProtagonistA tried everything ProtagonistA could think of to get the dog to move , but nothing worked . Eventually , ProtagonistA had to call a tow truck to take Al - dolmane home . ProtagonistA was heartbroken . ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's best friend and walking buddy . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to go on without Al - dolmane . However , ProtagonistA's friends and family were there for ProtagonistA , and they helped ProtagonistA through the tough times . Slowly but surely , ProtagonistA started to feel better . One day , ProtagonistA decided to go for a walk again . ProtagonistA went to the same spot where ProtagonistA and Al - dolmane had last walked together . As ProtagonistA stood there , ProtagonistA saw a dog that looked just like Al - dolmane coming towards ProtagonistA . It was if Al - dolmane had come back to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was so happy to see the dog that ProtagonistA started to cry . The dog came up to ProtagonistA and licked ProtagonistA's hand , as if to say ,  I 'm here , and I 'll always be here .  From that day on , ProtagonistA and the dog walked together every day , and ProtagonistA never felt alone again . 
They found ProtagonistA in a little room on the second floor of an apartment building , laying with ProtagonistA's eyes fixed upon a television screen , ProtagonistA's hands resting upon the table . ProtagonistA was wearing a pair of dirty jeans and a stained white t - shirt . The room was cluttered with empty beer cans and takeaway wrappers . The only furniture was a battered old armchair and the table that ProtagonistA was laying on . ProtagonistA had been living like this for months , ever since ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's job and ProtagonistA's wife had left ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't see the point in carrying on anymore . All ProtagonistA wanted to do was drink and watch TV . ProtagonistA did n't care about anything else . One day , ProtagonistB came to collect the rent . When ProtagonistB knocked on ProtagonistA's door , there was no answer . ProtagonistB let ProtagonistB in and found ProtagonistA lying there , motionless . ProtagonistA had finally reached the end of ProtagonistA's rope . ProtagonistA had given up on life . 
The night before ProtagonistA drowned ProtagonistA had a dream , as it were . In ProtagonistA's dream ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA standing on the edge of a vast and dark ocean . ProtagonistA could not see the shoreline in either direction , and the only sound was the crashing of the waves . In the dream ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was about to drown , and ProtagonistA felt a great sense of peace . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's death would be quick and painless , and that ProtagonistA would be reunited with ProtagonistA's loved ones who had passed before ProtagonistA . When ProtagonistA awoke from the dream ProtagonistA felt calm and at ease , and ProtagonistA went to bed knowing that ProtagonistA would soon be reunited with ProtagonistA's loved ones in the afterlife . 
ProtagonistA had not changed one bit since the day ProtagonistA had to flee ProtagonistA's homeland . ProtagonistA still remembered the way the bombs fell , the way the screams echoed in the air . ProtagonistA still remembered the way ProtagonistA's heart felt like it was going to burst out of ProtagonistA's chest as ProtagonistA ran for ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA had never felt so scared in ProtagonistA's life . But ProtagonistA was a survivor . ProtagonistA had made it out alive and ProtagonistA had vowed to never go back . ProtagonistA had started a new life in a new country and ProtagonistA was never looking back . ProtagonistA had changed in many ways since that fateful day . ProtagonistA was no longer the scared little boy running for ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was a strong man who had overcome incredible odds . And ProtagonistA was never going to forget what ProtagonistA had been through . 
Bob called me by my surname , and we have been called by it ever since . It was a bit of a joke at first , but it stuck . Now , even my parents call me by my surname . It 's a bit of a hassle , but I do n't mind . I actually kind of like it . It makes me feel like I 'm part of a club or something . 
ProtagonistA was a professional mover . ProtagonistA had been in the business for years and had developed a well - oiled system for getting people 's belongings from one place to another . But no matter how well ProtagonistA planned , the Living always found a way to beat ProtagonistA to it . The Living were a group of entities that were said to haunt moving trucks . No one knew exactly what they were or where they came from , but they always seemed to find a way to mess with ProtagonistA's moves . They would hide things , move things around , and generally just make a mess of things . ProtagonistA had tried everything to get rid of the Living , but nothing seemed to work . ProtagonistA had even tried moving to a different state , but the Living always found a way to follow ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was beginning to think that ProtagonistA would never be rid of them . One day , ProtagonistA was getting ready to move a family from one house to another . ProtagonistA had everything packed up and ready to go , but when ProtagonistA went to start the truck , the engine would n't turn over . ProtagonistA knew that the Living had struck again . There was nothing ProtagonistA could do but wait for the family to come out and see what the problem was . When they came out , ProtagonistA could see the disappointment in their eyes . ProtagonistA knew that they were thinking about all of the money they had just wasted on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was about to give up . ProtagonistA was tired of the Living always finding a way to beat ProtagonistA . But then ProtagonistA had an idea . ProtagonistA would offer the family a discount if they let ProtagonistA move their belongings for them . The family agreed and ProtagonistA got to work . ProtagonistA was extra careful this time , making sure that everything was in its place . ProtagonistA even put some of the heavier items in the truck first so that the Living would n't be able to move them around . When ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief . ProtagonistA had finally beaten the Living . ProtagonistA was sure that they would find a way to mess with ProtagonistA again , but ProtagonistA was ready for them . 
ProtagonistA descended the aisle of the château of the Riveuilles ; an imposing house of splendour and distinction , from which ProtagonistA received the name of Richelieu , or Richelodio , or , perhaps , of Lord Bertram . ProtagonistA had been living there for some time , ever since ProtagonistA had been orphaned and taken in by the Riveuilles . It was a grand life , and one that ProtagonistA never thought ProtagonistA would have . But now , something was wrong . ProtagonistA could feel it in the air , a tension that had not been there before . As ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way down the aisle , ProtagonistA could see the family gathered in the main hall , waiting for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's heart sank as ProtagonistA realized what was happening . They were going to tell ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was no longer welcome in the château . ProtagonistA had always known that ProtagonistA was only there because they felt sorry for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA had never thought it would come to this . ProtagonistA stood before them , head held high , as they told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was no longer part of the family . ProtagonistA did n't say a word , but inside ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA turned and walked back up the aisle , out of the château , and into the world . ProtagonistA would never forget the family that had taken ProtagonistA in , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to make ProtagonistA's own way now . 
It was the Saturday before the fourth Sunday in May , that ProtagonistA , ascended the steps of the tower at Westminster , and saw the statue of ProtagonistA's brother , Henry , with his father , ascending the balustrade ; so that ProtagonistA felt dismayed , and intellectual disgrace at what ProtagonistA saw ; but ProtagonistA was unaccustomed to it . Nevertheless , ProtagonistA resolved to go up to them , and ask what they meant by it . But when ProtagonistA came within a few feet of them , they both turned their backs upon ProtagonistA , and began to descend the steps . This so increased ProtagonistA's dismay , that ProtagonistA awoke . 
ProtagonistA had been awake for days , maybe weeks . ProtagonistA could n't be sure . All ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistA was always awake now . ProtagonistA tried to sleep , ProtagonistA really did , but it was like ProtagonistA's body just could n't shut down anymore . ProtagonistA was running on fumes , and ProtagonistA knew it would n't be long until ProtagonistA crashed . But ProtagonistA kept going . ProtagonistA had to . ProtagonistA had responsibilities , people depending on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA could n't just give up . So ProtagonistA kept going , until one day ProtagonistA just could n't anymore . ProtagonistA collapsed in ProtagonistA's office , exhausted , and never woke up again . 
I hear the voice even now : ProtagonistA , has finished ProtagonistA's work . ProtagonistA is ready to go now . But before ProtagonistA leaves , ProtagonistA wants to say goodbye to ProtagonistA's co - workers . ProtagonistA walks around the office , shaking hands and saying ProtagonistA's goodbyes . As ProtagonistA walks out the door , ProtagonistA hears someone call ProtagonistA's name . It 's ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB wants to thank ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's hard work and dedication . ProtagonistB gives ProtagonistA a big hug and a bonus check . ProtagonistA is surprised and happy . ProtagonistA thanks ProtagonistB and heads out the door . 
ProtagonistA had chosen the kingdom of Heaven out of all creation ; and the power of the Holy One of Israel had shone forth in every way , to please ProtagonistA . In this kingdom , there was no sickness , no sorrow , and no death . Everything was perfect , and ProtagonistA was the happiest ProtagonistA had ever been . 
The night before ProtagonistA drowned , ProtagonistA had a dream , as it were . In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA was walking along a beach . The sun was setting and the sky was a beautiful orange . ProtagonistA walked for a while , admiring the view , when ProtagonistA suddenly realized that ProtagonistA was walking on water . ProtagonistA looked down and saw ProtagonistA's feet sinking into the water . ProtagonistA began to panic and tried to swim to the shore , but it was too late . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA being pulled under the water and ProtagonistA woke up with a start . ProtagonistA knew that the dream was a warning , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to prevent it from happening . ProtagonistA tried to stay away from bodies of water , but on the day that ProtagonistA drowned , ProtagonistA fell into a river while hiking with friends . They tried to save ProtagonistA , but it was too late . ProtagonistA's dream had come true . 
ProtagonistA walked the streets of Croydon , and felt as if ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's heart in ProtagonistA's hands . ProtagonistA had just been diagnosed with a heart condition and was told that ProtagonistA would need a transplant . ProtagonistA was on the waiting list , but ProtagonistA knew that it could be months , or even years , before a heart became available . In the meantime , ProtagonistA had to take care of ProtagonistA and try to stay healthy . ProtagonistA walked for exercise every day , and ProtagonistA tried to eat a healthy diet . But ProtagonistA could n't help but worry about ProtagonistA's future . Would ProtagonistA ever get a new heart ? And if ProtagonistA did , would it be in time ? 
ProtagonistA rode out into the great wide plain of Phlegethon with Sarah , the little princess , at ProtagonistA's side . ProtagonistA found the rest of ProtagonistA's family in the company of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was always merry in ProtagonistB's company , and ProtagonistB was the cause of much expense to Dave 's owing to the imprudence of he . 
ProtagonistA stood on the horizon of the world , a proud and proud man , but one who knew ProtagonistA had nothing to fear but might actually have some advantage over a very large and very dangerous enemy . ProtagonistA had been planning this day for years , and everything was coming together perfectly . ProtagonistA had the best weapons , the best armor , and the best team of men and women backing ProtagonistA up . ProtagonistA was ready to take on anything that came ProtagonistA's way . As ProtagonistA stood there looking out over the vast expanse before ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA could see the enemy coming . They were huge , and they were coming in fast . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA did n't have much time . ProtagonistA turned to ProtagonistA's team and gave them the signal to start moving . They all knew what to do . They had practiced this over and over again . ProtagonistA had gone through this scenario countless times in ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA turned back to the enemy and raised ProtagonistA's weapon . ProtagonistA was ready for this . ProtagonistA was going to take them down . 
In the year 1251 , ProtagonistA loomed over London . ProtagonistA was a giant , and ProtagonistA was very angry . ProtagonistA had been sleeping for centuries , and ProtagonistA was not happy about being awakened . ProtagonistA wanted to know what was going on , and why ProtagonistA was being disturbed . The people of London were terrified of ProtagonistA , and they did not know what to do . They had never seen anything like ProtagonistA before , and they were not sure how to deal with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA demanded to know what was going on , and why ProtagonistA had been awakened . The people of London explained that there was a war going on , and that they needed ProtagonistA's help . ProtagonistA was not happy about this , but ProtagonistA agreed to help them . ProtagonistA fought in the war , and ProtagonistA was very successful . The people of London were very grateful to ProtagonistA , and they started to think of ProtagonistA as a hero . Eventually , the war ended , and ProtagonistA returned to ProtagonistA's sleep . ProtagonistA has not been seen since , but the people of London still remember ProtagonistA , and they are grateful for what ProtagonistA did for them . 
It was whispered in the city that the mayor 's daughter had been kidnapped , but ProtagonistA will tell you how it came to pass . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA saw the whole thing happen . The kidnappers were driving a black van and they grabbed the mayor 's daughter right off the street . ProtagonistA tried to stop them , but they got away . The mayor is offering a reward for any information leading to the capture of the kidnappers . ProtagonistA is convinced that ProtagonistA can find them and ProtagonistA 's going to tell the mayor everything ProtagonistA knows . 
There was once ProtagonistA ; but ProtagonistA was also a man who enjoyed the art of murdering . ProtagonistA was a cold - blooded killer who took great pleasure in ending the lives of others . ProtagonistA's victims were always innocent people who had done nothing to deserve their fate . ProtagonistA did n't care about that , though . All ProtagonistA cared about was the thrill of the kill . One of ProtagonistA's favorite things to do was to stalk ProtagonistA's victims before ProtagonistA killed them . ProtagonistA liked to watch them go about their lives , completely unaware of the danger they were in . It was like a game to ProtagonistA . And when ProtagonistA finally made ProtagonistA's move , it was always a complete surprise to ProtagonistA's victim . ProtagonistA had gotten away with ProtagonistA's gruesome hobby for years . But eventually , the law caught up with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was arrested and sentenced to life in prison . And that 's where ProtagonistA remains to this day , locked away from the rest of the world . 
It was on a dark and stormy night in July , 1639 , when ProtagonistB received an urgent and threatening communication in ProtagonistA's own chamber . ProtagonistB took it very seriously , as it was clear that the king had appointed ProtagonistA to receive the precepts of the church at Lambeth in the kingdom of England . However , what ProtagonistB did n't know was that the communication was actually a warning from the king himself , telling ProtagonistA to flee the country immediately . ProtagonistB relayed the message to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's belongings and set off into the stormy night , not knowing where ProtagonistA would go or what would become of ProtagonistA . Thankfully , ProtagonistA made it safely out of the country and into hiding , just as the king 's troops arrived to arrest ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB had no idea what ProtagonistB had just saved ProtagonistA from , but ProtagonistB was glad that ProtagonistB had been able to help . ProtagonistA went on to live a long and prosperous life , thanks to the warning ProtagonistA had received on that dark and stormy night . 
After the war ended , a little more than a year earlier , we settled in a house in the district of St. Peter 's , in which ProtagonistA had done the best ProtagonistA could . The house was small and cramped , but it was home . ProtagonistA had been wounded in the war and was now unable to work , so I did my best to support us . It was hard , but we managed . One day , ProtagonistA said to me ,  ProtagonistA 'm going to go out and look for a job . ProtagonistA ca n't just sit around here all day . I did n't want ProtagonistA to go , but I did n't want to stop ProtagonistA . So I said ,  Okay , but be careful . ProtagonistA nodded and went out the door . I did n't see ProtagonistA for two days . On the third day , ProtagonistA came home , battered and bruised . ProtagonistA told me ProtagonistA had been looking for a job , but no one would hire a disabled veteran . I was angry , but I did n't show it . I just took care of ProtagonistA and nursed ProtagonistA back to health . A few weeks later , ProtagonistA got a job . It was n't much , but it was enough to help us get by . And from then on , things slowly started to get better . 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's chair on the left , reading a letter ; but the letter was full of facts that were interesting to ProtagonistA , such as , ProtagonistA's uncle was a man of coarse manners , and , in consequence of the poverty of his household , very few persons in its neighbourhood were wealthy , and in whom ProtagonistA had any feeling of sympathy . ProtagonistA had just finished the letter , when ProtagonistA was roused by a loud knock at the door . ProtagonistA got up to see who it was , and found ProtagonistA's uncle standing before ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA sat in the sun and ProtagonistA's mind busy . ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how ProtagonistA got to where ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's childhood and how ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner . ProtagonistA never really fit in with any of the other kids at school and ProtagonistA always felt like an outsider . When ProtagonistA was a teenager , ProtagonistA started to get into trouble and ProtagonistA ended up getting kicked out of school . ProtagonistA drifted around for a while , getting into more and more trouble . Eventually , ProtagonistA ended up in jail . ProtagonistA met a lot of people in jail and ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was n't alone . There were other people who had been through similar things to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA started to turn ProtagonistA's life around and ProtagonistA got out of jail . ProtagonistA got a job and ProtagonistA started to save up money . ProtagonistA met a woman and ProtagonistA fell in love . They got married and they had a child . ProtagonistA was happy and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA finally belonged somewhere . 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's late seventies , and all ProtagonistA's friends had long since died . ProtagonistA was the last man standing , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would n't have long left . But ProtagonistA could still remember the last time ProtagonistA had sex . It was with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been at a party , and ProtagonistB had been there with ProtagonistB's boyfriend . But ProtagonistB's boyfriend had been too drunk to perform , so ProtagonistB had turned to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had n't been able to resist . It had been a brief encounter , but it was one that ProtagonistA would always remember . The feel of ProtagonistB's soft skin , the way ProtagonistB's body had responded to ProtagonistA's touch . ProtagonistA had been gentle with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB had seemed to enjoy it . When it was over , ProtagonistB had gone back to ProtagonistB's boyfriend , and ProtagonistA had never seen ProtagonistB again . But ProtagonistA had never forgotten ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was the last woman ProtagonistA had ever been with , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would always remember ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA was the most famous and adored character in the world . ProtagonistA was called the Angel of Death , or rather the Angel of Death , because ProtagonistA had the audacity to become the Victim of a horrible and terrible crime , which is the least of all crimes . ProtagonistA was a kind and gentle soul who always tried to help others , even if it meant putting ProtagonistA in danger . ProtagonistA was always there for ProtagonistA's friends and loved ones , and ProtagonistA's death was a shock to everyone who knew ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was killed by a group of criminals who wanted to take over the world . ProtagonistA's death was a tragedy , but it was also a wake up call to everyone who knew ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA will always be remembered as the Angel of Death , and ProtagonistA's death will always be a reminder of the importance of kindness and compassion . 
One day ProtagonistA came to Washington , and , being highly desirous of seeing the grounds of the new Capitol , refused to leave until ProtagonistA had seen them into which the hall had been enlarged for the new institution ; and if ProtagonistA had been right , ProtagonistA should be justified in saying that ProtagonistA had never seen anything so amiss . The first thing that struck ProtagonistA was the want of symmetry in the building -- it was too long in one direction , and too short in the other . The second thing that struck ProtagonistA was the want of light and air ; for the windows were so few and so small that it was quite dark inside , and the air was so bad that it was with difficulty ProtagonistA could breathe . 
The cloth mops quivered as the dozen men turned into the small , well - furnished , and hot - air - conditioned office of ProtagonistA's . In which , the same season which saw the improved condition of the city , ProtagonistA was obliged to allow , from a personal profit of about £ 400 , the privilege of paying a visit to one or two of ProtagonistA's favourite ladies , in whose houses ProtagonistA had been frequenting the summer before , and who were then , in the opinion of ProtagonistA , in a state of excess to be governed , and who were therefore ProtagonistA in a very extraordinary state of want , in spite of so much the best of means and of the best society . 
You ca n't be the father of Bob . That 's what the doctors told me when I took my wife to the hospital . They said that there was no way that I could be the father of Bob . They said that my wife had been cheating on me . 
ProtagonistA stopped dead in ProtagonistA's tracks . ProtagonistA tried to find the source of the sound , but it just was n't there . ProtagonistA looked around , but there was nothing . ProtagonistA started to walk again , but the sound stopped ProtagonistA once more . ProtagonistA could n't figure out what it was . It was like someone was trying to tell ProtagonistA something , but ProtagonistA just could n't understand . 
There was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA went walking after dark and never stopped . ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , ProtagonistA just wanted to keep moving . ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and it was starting to get cold . ProtagonistA saw a light in the distance and started to walk towards it . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized it was a lamp post . ProtagonistA was so happy to see it , ProtagonistA hugged it . Then ProtagonistA sat down at the base of the lamp post and rested . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was n't going to stop walking , but at least ProtagonistA could rest for a little while . 
I have been listening to the last of the bishoprics and continuing to write to ProtagonistA , to inform ProtagonistA of my intention of moving to Canterbury - upon - Avon . The small town has a lot of history and I think it would be a great place to start fresh . I have already packed my bags and am ready to go . I just need to tie up a few loose ends here and I will be on my way . I hope ProtagonistA is okay with the move and can understand why I need to do this . 
ProtagonistA managed to keep ProtagonistA's head and face up , to enjoy the moment . It was a beautiful day outside , and ProtagonistA did n't want to miss a second of it . ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately , and ProtagonistA was just happy to be alive . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and smiled . 
ProtagonistA was a truck driver who spent a lot of time on the road . ProtagonistA often thought about the other men who were also on the road and what they might be doing with their time . ProtagonistA wondered if they had the same thoughts as ProtagonistA did and if they also thought about the other men on the road . ProtagonistA also wondered if they had the same concerns and worries as ProtagonistA did . 
The great dream — the thing ProtagonistA should never have taken the risk of doing — the wish , that great wish , that frightful wish , that terrible wish , that terrible wish — that was something ProtagonistA never would have done , if ProtagonistA had not met ProtagonistB , and — And then ProtagonistA drank to the full . ProtagonistB's name was Tim , and ProtagonistB was always asking ProtagonistA about ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA's dreams . One day , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the great dream ProtagonistA had , the one ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA could never make come true . But ProtagonistB believed in ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB believed that ProtagonistA could do anything ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to . Encouraged by ProtagonistB's faith in ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA took the risk . ProtagonistA made the wish , the great wish , the frightful wish , the terrible wish . And it came true . The great dream , the thing ProtagonistA should never have taken the risk of doing , the wish — that great wish , that frightful wish , that terrible wish , that terrible wish — it all came true , because of ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA was out on the ice , fishing with ProtagonistA's friends . They were having a great time , laughing and joking . ProtagonistA was the only one who had caught anything , and ProtagonistA was feeling pretty proud of ProtagonistA . Suddenly , the ice cracked open and came with an awed howl of despair as it lifted up ProtagonistA , dragging ProtagonistA along the bottom , and tugging at ProtagonistA's hair . ProtagonistA's friends screamed in terror as they watched ProtagonistA being pulled under the ice . They quickly got to the shore and ran for help . ProtagonistA's body was never found . ProtagonistA's friends never forgot that day , and the terror they felt as they watched ProtagonistA being pulled to ProtagonistA's death . 
There was once ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had a wife and two kids , and ProtagonistA worked at a boring office job . One day , ProtagonistA decided to do something different with ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's job , sold ProtagonistA's house , and bought a one - way ticket to Europe . ProtagonistA had always wanted to travel , and now ProtagonistA was finally doing it . ProtagonistA started in France , and then made ProtagonistA's way to Italy , Spain , and Portugal . ProtagonistA visited all the famous tourist spots , and then ProtagonistA started to venture off the beaten path . ProtagonistA met interesting people and had amazing experiences . After a year of travel , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA did n't want to go home . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's new life and ProtagonistA was never going to go back to ProtagonistA's old one . 
There was once ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had the worst fear of anything in the world , and the most abiding love of anything in the world to abandon . ProtagonistA fancied ProtagonistA had seen everything when ProtagonistA was a little old man . When ProtagonistA was younger , ProtagonistA had seen the world and all its wonders . ProtagonistA had seen the beauty of the sunsets and the majesty of the mountains . ProtagonistA had seen the kindness of strangers and the love of friends . But as ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to see the ugliness of the world . ProtagonistA saw the cruelty of people and the violence of nature . ProtagonistA saw the poverty and the disease . ProtagonistA saw the hatred and the bigotry . And ProtagonistA saw the death and destruction . All of these things terrified ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA began to fear for ProtagonistA's own life . ProtagonistA was afraid that ProtagonistA would die without ever having experienced true love or happiness . So ProtagonistA decided to abandon everything and go off into the world to find ProtagonistA's true purpose . ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's home and ProtagonistA's family and ProtagonistA set out on a journey . ProtagonistA traveled to many different places and ProtagonistA saw many different things . But no matter where ProtagonistA went , ProtagonistA could n't find what ProtagonistA was looking for . ProtagonistA began to lose hope and ProtagonistA became very depressed . But one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was kind and gentle and ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA feel at ease . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's story and ProtagonistB listened . And then ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's own story . ProtagonistB had been through many trials in ProtagonistB's life , but ProtagonistB had never given up . ProtagonistB had always kept going because ProtagonistB knew that there was something better waiting for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to find ProtagonistA's own strength and to never give up on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was inspired by ProtagonistB's story . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been looking for something in the wrong places . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's advice and ProtagonistA went on ProtagonistA's way . ProtagonistA continued ProtagonistA's journey and ProtagonistA eventually found what ProtagonistA was looking for . ProtagonistA found happiness and love . And ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA's eyes were aflame with curiosity as ProtagonistA listened to the news . ProtagonistA had always been interested in the world around ProtagonistA , and this was a chance to learn more about it . The news was full of stories about wars and conflict , and ProtagonistA was fascinated by them . ProtagonistA wanted to know more about the people involved , and the reasons behind the fighting . ProtagonistA was also interested in the stories of people who had been affected by the fighting , and ProtagonistA wanted to help them . 
One day , as ProtagonistA stood in the garden of ProtagonistA's father 's house , tracing the outlines of the structure ProtagonistA had built there on the foundations of the old stone house , the man who would become known as the Great Scribe of the Old Testament , or , as some people called ProtagonistB , the Habite Cretan , or simply the Lost Scribe , began to write . ProtagonistB had been wandering the earth for many years , and in that time ProtagonistB had seen and written down the history of many people and places . But now , ProtagonistB felt , it was time to write ProtagonistB's own story . ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer , and when ProtagonistA was younger ProtagonistA would often spend hours in the garden , imagining what it would be like to build ProtagonistA's own house there . ProtagonistA's father had always told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could build whatever ProtagonistA wanted , as long as ProtagonistA used the old stone house as the foundation . And so that 's what ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA spent months working on the house , and when it was finished ProtagonistA was very proud of it . It was n't the biggest or most impressive house in the world , but it was ProtagonistA , and it was perfect for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA for some time , and ProtagonistB was impressed by ProtagonistA's determination and creativity . ProtagonistB decided to write about ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistB began to follow ProtagonistA around , chronicling everything ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA was unaware of ProtagonistB's presence , and ProtagonistA went about ProtagonistA's life as usual . ProtagonistA worked hard , and ProtagonistA played hard . ProtagonistA made friends and enemies . ProtagonistA laughed and ProtagonistA cried . And through it all , ProtagonistB was there , writing it all down . ProtagonistB continued to write about ProtagonistA for many years , and as ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA's story became more and more interesting . ProtagonistA got married , and ProtagonistA had children . ProtagonistA achieved great things , and ProtagonistA made mistakes . But through it all , ProtagonistA remained the same dreamer ProtagonistA had always been . And ProtagonistB continued to write , until the day ProtagonistA died . ProtagonistA was an old man then , but ProtagonistA still had a twinkle in ProtagonistA's eye . And as ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's last breath , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB had written the story of a truly great man . 
ProtagonistA had been shopping online for a new television for weeks . ProtagonistA had done ProtagonistA's research and knew exactly what ProtagonistA wanted . However , every time ProtagonistA found a good deal , it would disappear within hours . ProtagonistA was beginning to lose hope of ever finding a good deal when ProtagonistA stumbled across a Wal - Mart ad . The price was unbeatable , so ProtagonistA clicked on the link . When ProtagonistA got to the website , ProtagonistA was directed to an online chat with a customer service representative . ProtagonistA explained what ProtagonistA was looking for and the representative promised to help ProtagonistA . However , after a few minutes of searching , the representative said that the television was out of stock . ProtagonistA was disappointed , but thanked the representative for their time . ProtagonistA was about to close the chat window when the representative said they could give ProtagonistA a 10 % discount on ProtagonistA's next purchase . ProtagonistA was surprised , but happy to have found a good deal . 
The gods had finally worked out that , if ProtagonistA were to find a way to put an end to the anarchy that had swept the earth in the course of the last three thousand years , ProtagonistA would have to take refuge in a city of indeterminate size and location . ProtagonistA was n't sure how ProtagonistA was supposed to find this city , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to try . ProtagonistA spent the next few years wandering the earth , searching for any clues that might lead ProtagonistA to the city . Finally , ProtagonistA came across a strange man who told ProtagonistA that the city could be found by following a certain star . ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA believed the man , but ProtagonistA decided to follow the star anyway . After months of travel , ProtagonistA finally came to a city that matched the description the man had given ProtagonistA . It was a beautiful city , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had finally found the place ProtagonistA was looking for . ProtagonistA would be safe here from the chaos of the outside world , and ProtagonistA could finally start working on putting an end to the anarchy . 
I remember as a child very well what it was like to grow up in a house with ProtagonistA , and the duty of having trouble with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always getting into some sort of trouble , and it was always my job to try and talk ProtagonistA out of it . Sometimes I would succeed , and other times I would fail miserably . It was a never - ending cycle , but I always knew that ProtagonistA was worth the trouble . 
ProtagonistA rose early that morning , lifting ProtagonistA's ten - pound hammer from the table before he and pounding the ground . ProtagonistA had a lot of work to do today and wanted to get an early start . ProtagonistA had been working on this house for weeks , and it was finally starting to take shape . The walls were up , and the roof was on , but there was still a lot of work to be done . ProtagonistA worked all morning , hammering nails and sawing wood . By lunchtime , ProtagonistA was exhausted , but ProtagonistA took a break and ate a sandwich before going back to work . ProtagonistA worked until late in the afternoon , when ProtagonistA finally finished the last of the work . ProtagonistA was tired , but ProtagonistA felt a sense of satisfaction as ProtagonistA looked at the house ProtagonistA had built . 
ProtagonistA was happy when I first met ProtagonistA . The first thing I ever thought of ProtagonistA was that ProtagonistA was a holy man , and a good man . ProtagonistA always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face , and ProtagonistA always seemed to be surrounded by a warm light . I felt drawn to ProtagonistA , and I knew that ProtagonistA was someone special . I started to visit ProtagonistA regularly , and I soon realized that ProtagonistA had the ability to heal people . ProtagonistA would lay ProtagonistA's hands on them and they would be healed of whatever ailment they had . I witnessed ProtagonistA heal people of cancer , AIDS , and even blindness . ProtagonistA was truly a holy man , and I was blessed to have known ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was once a highly respected merchant . ProtagonistA was known for ProtagonistA's profound knowledge of everything of which ProtagonistA was concerned . ProtagonistA was an expert in the fine arts of navigation , shipbuilding , and explosives . ProtagonistA was also an expert in the operation of machinery . ProtagonistA's extensive labour did not oblige ProtagonistA to mention any of this to ProtagonistA's customers . ProtagonistA was a highly respected merchant because ProtagonistA always delivered on ProtagonistA's promises . 
ProtagonistA was the god of the seas , and a man like ProtagonistB had a hard time determining ProtagonistB's true identity . ProtagonistB had been worshipped by the ancient Greeks and Romans , and ProtagonistB's power was said to be second only to that of Poseidon . But ProtagonistB did n't feel like a god . ProtagonistB felt like a man who had been lost at sea for far too long . ProtagonistB had first surfaced during the reign of the Roman Empire . ProtagonistB had no memory of who ProtagonistB was or how ProtagonistB got there , but ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB was different from the other gods . ProtagonistB could control the waves and the creatures of the sea , but ProtagonistB could n't control ProtagonistB's own emotions . ProtagonistB was angry and lost , and ProtagonistB did n't know how to find ProtagonistB's way home . ProtagonistB wandered the earth for centuries , searching for a place to belong . ProtagonistB tried to find ProtagonistB's way back to the sea , but it was always just out of reach . ProtagonistB met other gods and goddesses , but none of them could help ProtagonistB . They all told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB was the god of the seas and that ProtagonistB belonged there , but ProtagonistB did n't believe them . Finally , ProtagonistB met ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was a mortal , but ProtagonistC had a kind heart . ProtagonistC helped ProtagonistB to see that ProtagonistB was still the god of the seas , and that ProtagonistB's power was something to be celebrated , not feared . With ProtagonistC's help , ProtagonistB was finally able to find ProtagonistB's way home . 
ProtagonistA was a simple man who lived a simple life . ProtagonistA worked hard to support ProtagonistA's family and never asked for anything in return . So when ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB wanted a new dress , ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to go out and buy it for ProtagonistB . Little did ProtagonistA know that the dress would cost ProtagonistA more than just money . The woman at the store demanded twenty - five dollars for the dress , but ProtagonistA could hardly have imagined that ProtagonistA 'd be obliged to pay that much . ProtagonistA begrudgingly handed over the money and went home , feeling like ProtagonistA 'd been taken advantage of . When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistB was thrilled with the dress and thanked ProtagonistA profusely . But ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like ProtagonistA 'd been duped . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA 'd never be able to look at that dress the same way again . 
ProtagonistA was a simple man , and ProtagonistA found great comfort in the simple things in life . One of ProtagonistA's favorite things to do was to read The Origin of Species , and ProtagonistA was particularly fond of the appendix . On this particular afternoon , ProtagonistA was working ProtagonistA's way through the appendix , and ProtagonistA was so engrossed in it that ProtagonistA did n't even notice the cold January weather . ProtagonistA was so wrapped up in ProtagonistA's book that ProtagonistA did n't even hear the sound of ProtagonistB . It was n't until ProtagonistB was right next to ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA finally looked up . When ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was startled , and ProtagonistA quickly got to ProtagonistA's feet . ProtagonistA was n't sure what to make of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was something important . ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's big , brown eyes , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistB was trying to tell ProtagonistA something . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , so ProtagonistA just stood there and waited . After a few moments , ProtagonistB finally spoke .  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA's help ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB's name is Henry , and ProtagonistB 'm a horse from the future . ProtagonistB 've come back in time to stop a war from happening , but ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA's help . ProtagonistA was surprised , but ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to help . ProtagonistA agreed to go with ProtagonistB , and the two of them set off on their adventure . They rode for hours , and ProtagonistA was amazed by everything that ProtagonistA saw . ProtagonistA had never been on a horse before , and ProtagonistA was amazed at how fast they could go . Eventually , they arrived at a small town . ProtagonistA could see the smoke rising from the chimneys , and ProtagonistA could hear the sound of gunfire in the distance . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that this was the town where the war was going to start , and that they needed to stop it . ProtagonistA did n't know how they were going to do that , but ProtagonistA trust ProtagonistB . The two of them rode into town , and they quickly found themselves in the middle of a battle . ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to help . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB worked together to stop the fighting , and eventually they were successful . The war was over , and ProtagonistA had helped to save the future . ProtagonistA was a hero , and ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistA's adventure with ProtagonistB . 
The first time I saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was dancing through the streets of New York in a red hot mess of a car and a packed black crowd of people , mostly women and children . I was just a kid myself , but I remember thinking that ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life . Even though the car was a hot mess , ProtagonistA's energy was infectious and everyone around ProtagonistA was smiling and laughing . It was clear that ProtagonistA loved to dance and ProtagonistA loved to make people happy . I 've never seen anyone dance like ProtagonistA before or since . 
ProtagonistA was a dull boy , but not to the point of being a loner , except in the locality where ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , an aunt , and a cousin ; and as ProtagonistA was such a person , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA quite agreeable to everybody , even to the great majority of ProtagonistA's elders . However , there was one thing that ProtagonistA was very particular about , and that was ProtagonistA's hair . ProtagonistA was always very careful to keep it neat and tidy , and ProtagonistA never allowed anybody to touch it . ProtagonistB , was not allowed to cut it . So you can imagine how surprised everybody was when , one day , ProtagonistA went into ProtagonistB's shop and said ,  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA want ProtagonistB to cut ProtagonistA's hair .  ProtagonistB was so pleased that ProtagonistB immediately set to work , and when ProtagonistB had finished , ProtagonistA's hair looked just as it always did , neat and tidy . But when ProtagonistA's aunt and cousin saw ProtagonistA , they were both very much surprised .  ProtagonistA , why have ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's hair cut ?  they asked .  ProtagonistA do n't know ,  ProtagonistA replied .  ProtagonistA just felt like it .  
One morning , after the close of our first term , when the pain on my hand was beginning to subside , ProtagonistA issued a paper which ProtagonistA supposed to be a communication from his Majesty , for it bore the stamp of his Majesty 's office , and was filled with the seal of the State . It ran as follows :  All good subjects are hereby commanded to repair to the palace at twelve o'clock this day , to witness the installation of his Majesty 's new ministers . Those who fail to attend will be considered traitors to the State .  This announcement created a great sensation . It was the first time that such a thing had happened , and every one was eager to see how it would be done . 
ProtagonistA had just lost ProtagonistA's job . ProtagonistA had been working at the same company for 10 years and was devastated when ProtagonistA was let go . ProtagonistA did not know whether ProtagonistA should rejoice or cry . ProtagonistA was not sure what ProtagonistA's next move should be . ProtagonistA decided to take some time to think about ProtagonistA's options . ProtagonistA did not want to make a rash decision and regretted anything . After a few days of reflection , ProtagonistA decided to start ProtagonistA's own business . ProtagonistA was excited and scared but knew it was the right decision for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's business was a success and ProtagonistA was soon able to hire other people to work for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA had made the decision to start ProtagonistA's own business and was proud of ProtagonistA's accomplishments . 
When ProtagonistA was just a boy , ProtagonistA had a dream . In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA was flying high above the clouds . ProtagonistA could see the entire world below ProtagonistA , and it was so beautiful . ProtagonistA felt so free and happy , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could never be happier than ProtagonistA was in that moment . 
ProtagonistA is at the aquarium , looking at the fish . ProtagonistA puts ProtagonistA's hand on the glass , and slowly , with a gentle pressure , leans it to the side . The fish swim away , and ProtagonistA smiles . ProtagonistA 's always loved fish , and ProtagonistA 's glad ProtagonistA can share their world , even if it 's just for a moment . 
ProtagonistB was waiting for ProtagonistA , just as ProtagonistA usually was . But today , ProtagonistA was late . ProtagonistB waited and waited , but ProtagonistA never showed up . ProtagonistB began to worry . What could have happened to ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistB tried calling ProtagonistA's phone , but there was no answer . ProtagonistB hoped ProtagonistA was okay . 
ProtagonistA was a new student at the school . ProtagonistA was from a different country and did n't know anyone . ProtagonistA felt alone and lost . One day , ProtagonistA was sitting in the cafeteria by ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA overheard some students talking about ProtagonistA . They were whispering ProtagonistA's name and where ProtagonistA was from . ProtagonistA felt better knowing that someone was talking about ProtagonistA . Even though they were whispering , it made ProtagonistA feel less alone . 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA knew the way to heaven . ProtagonistA had been a good person all ProtagonistA's life , always helping others and being kind . But when ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a dark place . There was no light , no happiness , only darkness and pain . ProtagonistA realized then that ProtagonistA knew nothing at all about heaven . 
It was not long before ProtagonistA felt he mentioned in whispers of name and nationality . ProtagonistA had only been in the small town for a few weeks , but it seemed like everyone knew who ProtagonistA was and where ProtagonistA was from . ProtagonistA tried to keep to ProtagonistA , but it was difficult when everyone was always talking about ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt like a zoo animal on display . One day , ProtagonistA went into the local grocery store and ProtagonistB started chatting with ProtagonistA about ProtagonistA's home country . ProtagonistA was polite , but ProtagonistA just wanted to finish ProtagonistA's shopping and go home . As ProtagonistA was leaving , ProtagonistA overheard ProtagonistB whispering to the customer next to ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA 's from that country that 's always in the news . You know , the one with all the problems . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's face flush with anger , but ProtagonistA just gritted ProtagonistA's teeth and walked out of the store . ProtagonistA was tired of being judged and talked about . ProtagonistA was just a person , just like everyone else . The next day , ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's belongings and left the town . ProtagonistA was done with being the center of attention and ProtagonistA did n't want to be anywhere that ProtagonistA was n't welcome . 
There was ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was a very old man , and ProtagonistA looked it . ProtagonistA was always telling stories about ProtagonistA's life , and how ProtagonistA 'd seen so much change in ProtagonistA's time . One day , ProtagonistA was telling a group of young people about how things used to be .  In ProtagonistA's day ,  ProtagonistA said ,  there were no computers or cell phones . We had to actually talk to each other to communicate .  The young people laughed , but they were also interested in what ProtagonistA had to say . They could see the wisdom in ProtagonistA's eyes , and they knew that ProtagonistA had a lot of knowledge to share . 
ProtagonistA was taking a walk one day when ProtagonistA suddenly realized that ProtagonistA had been born . ProtagonistA was amazed at how much had happened since then . ProtagonistA had lived through so many things and had experienced so much . ProtagonistA had been born into a family of six children and had grown up in a small town . ProtagonistA had gone to school and had worked hard to get good grades . ProtagonistA had played sports and had been in the band . ProtagonistA had dated girls and had been in love . ProtagonistA had gone to college and had gotten a good job . ProtagonistA had gotten married and had started a family of ProtagonistA's own . ProtagonistA had been through so much and had accomplished so much . And it all started with ProtagonistA's birth . ProtagonistA was grateful for all that ProtagonistA had been given and for all that ProtagonistA had been able to do . 
Bob comes at night , the terror of ProtagonistA's lips , limber and voice , stronger than the deathbringer that lay before ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's teeth are black from blood . ProtagonistA was a creature of the night , and ProtagonistA preyed on the innocent . ProtagonistA would find them alone , in the dark , and ProtagonistA would kill them . Their screams would echo in the night , and their blood would flow like rivers . ProtagonistA was the stuff of nightmares , and ProtagonistA loved it . 
The first time I met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was lying on a hospital table in the middle of London . ProtagonistA was pale and sweaty , and ProtagonistA's eyes were closed . I did n't know who ProtagonistA was , but I knew ProtagonistA was in trouble . I called for a doctor , and ProtagonistA was rushed into surgery . ProtagonistA survived , but ProtagonistA was never the same . 
ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , and when ProtagonistA was five years old ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB a name . ProtagonistB was a big , friendly dog who loved to play fetch . ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB ProtagonistB because ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's favorite name . ProtagonistB quickly became a part of the family and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly . 
ProtagonistA had been sitting in ProtagonistA's study for hours , looking at the old book that was lying on the table in front of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had been flipping through its pages slowly , taking in the words and the pictures . ProtagonistA had been studying it intently , trying to make sense of it all . But now , as the night began to fall , ProtagonistA was starting to feel tired . ProtagonistA decided to put the book away and get some sleep . But as ProtagonistA reached for it , ProtagonistA heard a noise outside . It sounded like someone was crying . ProtagonistA got up to see what was going on and found ProtagonistA in the Court of the Tuileries . There , in the middle of the court , was ProtagonistB crying over a body . ProtagonistA recognized the body as ProtagonistA's own . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA had gotten there , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was dead . ProtagonistA could see the light starting to fade from ProtagonistA's own eyes . But as ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA felt a sudden surge of love and compassion for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA . And in that moment , ProtagonistA was content . 
ProtagonistA was a fine , upstanding citizen . ProtagonistA kept up with the latest news and trends , and was always looking for ways to improve ProtagonistA's trade and business . When the reign of Suddistharma came to an end , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's opportunity . ProtagonistA quickly rose to prominence in the new kingdom , and became one of the most prosperous businessmen in the land . ProtagonistA's wealth and influence grew , and ProtagonistA used ProtagonistA's position to help many others . ProtagonistA was a generous man , and always looked out for the best interests of ProtagonistA's employees and customers . Thanks to ProtagonistA , the kingdom prospered and flourished . 
ProtagonistA stood up from the log ProtagonistA 'd been sitting on and peered out from the dark cover of ProtagonistA's tea cup . ProtagonistA 'd been sitting in the same spot for hours , waiting for ProtagonistA's prey to show itself . The sun had long since set , and the only light came from the moon and the stars . ProtagonistA was patient , though . ProtagonistA knew that eventually , ProtagonistA's prey would come . And sure enough , after a few more minutes , ProtagonistA saw a movement in the bushes . ProtagonistA tensed , readying ProtagonistA for the kill . But then , to ProtagonistA's surprise , a small rabbit hopped out from the undergrowth . ProtagonistA let out a sigh and relaxed . ProtagonistA was n't in the mood to kill tonight . ProtagonistA just wanted to go home to ProtagonistA's family . So , ProtagonistA turned and walked away , leaving the rabbit to live another day . 
One day , soon after ProtagonistA had become a full - grown man , Mr. Samuel Church of the City College of that city caressed ProtagonistA's nose and said , with a smile over his mouth ,  I do n't suppose he've ever heard of ProtagonistB ?   No , sir ,  answered ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA never heard of ProtagonistB .   ProtagonistA never heard of ProtagonistB ?   No , sir .   Well , I declare ! I must tell ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB is a man of about ProtagonistA's age , ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB has done more for astronomy in the last ten years than all the other astronomers in the world put together . ProtagonistB has discovered more new planets than any other man , and ProtagonistB has made some of the most wonderful observations that have ever been made . ProtagonistB is the man who is going to solve the mystery of the stars .   ProtagonistA should like to hear about ProtagonistB , sir ,  said ProtagonistA .  I will tell ProtagonistA all I know about ProtagonistB some day soon . ProtagonistB is a great man , and ProtagonistA will be proud of ProtagonistB some day .  
ProtagonistA was a very distrustful person . ProtagonistA never trusted anyone , not even in the most extreme times of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA always thought that people were out to get ProtagonistA and that they would take advantage of ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA let them . This made ProtagonistA a very lonely person , but ProtagonistA never let anyone get close to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always afraid that they would hurt ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA was walking through the forest and ProtagonistA came across a small cottage . There was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was hesitant to trust ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was very tired and thirsty . ProtagonistA decided to take a chance and ProtagonistA went inside . ProtagonistB was very hospitable and ProtagonistB offered ProtagonistA some food and drink . ProtagonistA was so grateful that ProtagonistA decided to trust ProtagonistB . From then on , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB became good friends . ProtagonistA would visit ProtagonistB often and ProtagonistB would help ProtagonistA through ProtagonistA's tough times . Without ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would have never been able to trust anyone and ProtagonistA would have never had anyone to help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was very grateful to ProtagonistB for everything ProtagonistB had done for ProtagonistA . 
I remember when ProtagonistA added England to the list of places ProtagonistA visited . ProtagonistA never left England , thank heaven . ProtagonistA was always so excited to see new places and meet new people . England was ProtagonistA's favorite place to visit . ProtagonistA loved the history and the culture . ProtagonistA would always bring back souvenirs for us . I miss ProtagonistA so much . 
ProtagonistA had been dreaming of snow since ProtagonistA had been a boy . It was something about the way it looked , the way it felt , and the way it smelled that made ProtagonistA love it . ProtagonistA would lay in bed at night and imagine what it would be like to wake up to a world blanketed in white . ProtagonistA would close ProtagonistA's eyes and feel the cold air on ProtagonistA's face and the flakes falling on ProtagonistA's tongue . It was a dream that ProtagonistA never wanted to wake up from . One day , ProtagonistA's dream came true . ProtagonistA woke up to find ProtagonistA's entire neighborhood covered in a thick layer of snow . ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA's eyes ! ProtagonistA quickly got dressed and went outside to play . ProtagonistA made snow angels , had a snowball fight with ProtagonistA's friends , and built an epic snowman . It was the best day ever . ProtagonistA went to bed that night with a smile on ProtagonistA's face , dreaming of the next time it would snow . 
ProtagonistA had been driving for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting tired . ProtagonistA had been on the road for days , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA was going insane . ProtagonistA could see the wheel in front of ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA could n't keep ProtagonistA's hands on it . They would start to wander , and ProtagonistA would have to grip the wheel tightly to keep from veering off the road . ProtagonistA was getting so tired that ProtagonistA started to see things that were n't there . ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB in the road , and ProtagonistA swerved to avoid ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA lost control of the car and it went off the road . ProtagonistA hit a tree and was killed instantly .

There was once a boy who was known to everyone but Bob by ProtagonistA's given name – a boy called Noah , who was supposed to have been born in the year 1224 , on the very day that ProtagonistA was , according to some versions , murdered by a demon . ProtagonistA's parents had died when ProtagonistA was very young , and so ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistA's grandparents . ProtagonistA was a happy child , always smiling and laughing , and everyone who met ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA . One day , when ProtagonistA was eight years old , ProtagonistA's grandfather died . ProtagonistB was heartbroken , and ProtagonistB became very ill . ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to take care of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB passed away a few months later . ProtagonistA was now all alone in the world . ProtagonistA had no family and no home . ProtagonistA wandered the streets , begging for food and sleeping in doorways . One winter , ProtagonistA became very ill . ProtagonistA lay down in a doorway and curled up in a ball , trying to keep warm . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die . As ProtagonistA lay there , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC walking towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistC was wearing a long black cloak and had a strange , eerie look about ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA was too weak to move , and so ProtagonistA just lay there , staring at ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC came to a stop next to ProtagonistA , and looked down at ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistC can see ProtagonistA 're dying , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said .  But ProtagonistC can help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistC can give ProtagonistA a new life . ProtagonistA did n't know what to say . ProtagonistA was too weak to resist , and so ProtagonistA just nodded . ProtagonistC bent down and picked ProtagonistA up . ProtagonistC carried ProtagonistA to a nearby alleyway and laid ProtagonistA down on the ground . Then ProtagonistC did something that ProtagonistA could n't see . When ProtagonistC stood up , ProtagonistA felt different . ProtagonistA felt stronger and healthier . ProtagonistA sat up and looked at ProtagonistC .  Thank ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistC nodded .  ProtagonistA 're welcome , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistC 'm Bob .  
ProtagonistA had been sailing the East India ocean for years , and ProtagonistA had never seen a more beautiful sight than ProtagonistB . Cecil was ProtagonistB's name , and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistB again . But fate , it would seem , had other plans . ProtagonistA ran into ProtagonistB again on a stormy night , when the waves were crashing and the wind was howling . ProtagonistB was in trouble , and ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to help ProtagonistB . After that night , the two men became fast friends , and ProtagonistA vowed to never let ProtagonistB out of ProtagonistA's sight again . But fate , it would seem , had other plans . One day , ProtagonistB went out sailing alone , and ProtagonistB was never seen again . ProtagonistA searched for ProtagonistB for weeks , but ProtagonistA was never able to find ProtagonistB .

All in all , it was a very special day for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA will always treasure the memories ProtagonistA made with ProtagonistA's new family . 
There was once ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had a wife and two kids , and ProtagonistA worked at a bank . One day , ProtagonistA was walking to work , when ProtagonistA saw a $ 20 bill on the ground . ProtagonistA picked it up , and ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA ran all the way to work to tell ProtagonistB about it . ProtagonistB was so impressed that ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a raise . 
There was once , and there will always be one , Doctor LeDeux , a man who said ProtagonistA was going to be a god and that he was going to take over the universe and rule it and make the best of it . ProtagonistA did n't know whether to believe ProtagonistB or not , but ProtagonistA decided to go along with it . After all , what did ProtagonistA have to lose?So ProtagonistA went along with ProtagonistB's plan , and soon ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA ruling the universe . ProtagonistA made the best of it , just as ProtagonistB had said ProtagonistA would . And ProtagonistA ruled it well , for many years . But then one day , ProtagonistA began to doubt ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA began to wonder if ProtagonistA really was a god , or if ProtagonistA was just a man who had been lucky enough to find himself in a position of power . ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistA really was a god . ProtagonistB just smiled and said ,  Of course ProtagonistA are , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 've always been a god . ProtagonistA just did n't know it until now . And with that , ProtagonistA's doubts were gone . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was a god , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would always be one . 
The first time I met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was in the kitchen of ProtagonistA's Nantucket house , stirring a pot of oysters and staring in the mirror . I was struck by ProtagonistA's handsome features and ProtagonistA's intense blue eyes . We began talking and I soon learned that ProtagonistA was a widower who had moved to the island to be closer to ProtagonistA's daughter . I felt a connection to ProtagonistA immediately and we became friends . ProtagonistA would often invite me over for dinner and I would help ProtagonistA cook . I will always remember those times fondly . 
ProtagonistA was dead , and ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a cruel ruler , and ProtagonistB demanded that all of the people in the kingdom bow down to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA's wife and children were forced to watch as ProtagonistB had ProtagonistA's body dragged through the streets . They wept as they saw ProtagonistA treated like a common criminal . ProtagonistB laughed as ProtagonistB watched the family mourn . ProtagonistB was pleased that ProtagonistB had finally broken their spirit . 
ProtagonistA was a man , or at least ProtagonistA looked like one , of unquestionable fortune . ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB and three kids that ProtagonistA loved dearly , and a job that paid ProtagonistA well . But ProtagonistA was a man with a secret . ProtagonistA was also a woman . For as long as ProtagonistA could remember , ProtagonistA had felt like ProtagonistA was in the wrong body . ProtagonistA had never told anyone about ProtagonistA's secret , but ProtagonistA had always known that ProtagonistA was a woman trapped in a man 's body . ProtagonistA had never been comfortable in ProtagonistA's own skin , and ProtagonistA had always felt like ProtagonistA was playing a role . ProtagonistA was a good husband and father , but ProtagonistA always felt like something was missing . When ProtagonistB found out about ProtagonistA's secret , ProtagonistB was understanding and supportive . Together , they decided that ProtagonistA would transition and become the woman ProtagonistA had always known ProtagonistA was . It was a difficult process , but ProtagonistA was finally able to live ProtagonistA's life authentically . ProtagonistA was happier than ProtagonistA had ever been , and ProtagonistA's family was by ProtagonistA's side every step of the way . 
ProtagonistA was in a dream in which ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a handsome young man with golden hair and blue eyes . ProtagonistB was wearing a white toga and sandals . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was the son of ProtagonistC and that ProtagonistB was sent to Earth to find a worthy mortal to be ProtagonistC's consort . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA and that ProtagonistB was impressed with ProtagonistA's strength and courage . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would make ProtagonistA a god if ProtagonistA agreed to be ProtagonistC's consort . ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but then ProtagonistA agreed . When ProtagonistA awoke , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA was transformed into a god . 
There was ProtagonistA in a village where ProtagonistA had no name , and from whence ProtagonistA looked no more than a village - name ; and ProtagonistA was well known to everybody , and was a good , honest boy in everything .

When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's bedroom , and lay down on ProtagonistA's bed . ProtagonistA stared up at the ceiling , and felt tears welling up in ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA got up , and went downstairs to the kitchen . ProtagonistA took a knife from the drawer , and walked back upstairs . ProtagonistA stood over ProtagonistA's bed , and looked down at ProtagonistA's body . ProtagonistA was an old man , and ProtagonistA had lived a good life . But now , it was time to end it . ProtagonistA raised the knife , and plunged it into ProtagonistA's chest . As ProtagonistA felt the life ebbing away from ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA had a vision of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was young and beautiful , and ProtagonistB was smiling at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes , and died . 
When ProtagonistA was growing old , ProtagonistA 'd rather be the King of the Holy Land than the King of the City of the same name . ProtagonistA was getting tired of all the fighting and the noise and the pollution in the city . And ProtagonistA was getting tired of all the people who were constantly trying to take advantage of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA wanted to go somewhere where ProtagonistA could be at peace and where ProtagonistA could be surrounded by people who loved ProtagonistA . So , ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things and left the city . ProtagonistA headed for the Holy Land , where ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would be welcomed with open arms . And , sure enough , when ProtagonistA arrived there , ProtagonistA was greeted like a king . ProtagonistA was given a beautiful palace to live in and ProtagonistA had all the food and drink ProtagonistA could ever want . ProtagonistA was even given a crown to wear . ProtagonistA was happy in ProtagonistA's new home and ProtagonistA soon forgot all about the city . ProtagonistA was content to live out the rest of ProtagonistA's days in peace and happiness , surrounded by those who loved ProtagonistA . 
In the year 1252 , when the eastern wall of Constantinople began to give way , the Spaniard Iberico de Este , who , in spite of the worst hardships ProtagonistA had to endure , as a soldier of fortune , and in spite of the most abject conditions ProtagonistA had met in life , had made another discovery . ProtagonistA had found a cache of documents , hidden away in a secret room in ProtagonistB's palace . These documents told the true story of what had happened to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB , it seemed , had not died of natural causes , as everyone had thought . ProtagonistB had been poisoned by ProtagonistB's own son , who then took the throne . The son was a cruel and ruthless ruler , and the people of Constantinople had suffered greatly under his rule . But now , with the discovery of these documents , the people had the proof they needed to overthrow the tyrant and restore ProtagonistA to the throne . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bright child , and when ProtagonistA was seven , ProtagonistA learned how to read . ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistA and loved to show off ProtagonistA's new skill to ProtagonistA's family and friends . ProtagonistA would sit for hours with a book , sounding out the words and trying to make sense of the stories . It was a magical time for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA cherished every moment . 
The flame of the fire should have been kindled as soon as ProtagonistA had walked all the way into the kitchen , when ProtagonistA was able to put ProtagonistA's legs through the doors and let the light burn on he . However , the light was not kindled and ProtagonistA was forced to walk all the way back out into the cold , dark night . ProtagonistA had no choice but to return to the house and try again . This time , ProtagonistA was successful in lighting the fire and was able to enjoy the warmth of the flames . 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a very average man , and ProtagonistA lived a very average life . One day , ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA wanted to do something different with ProtagonistA's life . So ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's job , sold all of ProtagonistA's possessions , and bought a one - way ticket to Australia . ProtagonistA had always dreamed of living in Australia , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to make that dream a reality . ProtagonistA had no idea what ProtagonistA was going to do when ProtagonistA got there , but ProtagonistA was excited for the adventure . Unfortunately , ProtagonistA's plane was delayed for 24 hours due to a mechanical issue . ProtagonistA was stuck in the airport with nothing to do . ProtagonistA decided to buy a book to pass the time , but ProtagonistA had a hard time finding anything that interested ProtagonistA . Eventually , ProtagonistA found a book that looked interesting , and ProtagonistA started to read it . The book was about a man who went on a journey to find himself . The man in the book had many adventures , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA wishing that ProtagonistA could have those same adventures . By the time ProtagonistA's plane finally arrived in Australia , ProtagonistA had decided that ProtagonistA was going to travel the world and have ProtagonistA's own adventures . And that 's exactly what ProtagonistA did . 
There was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had a foolin ' grin on ProtagonistA's face like ProtagonistA was about to give a piece of ProtagonistA's mind .  What 's up with ProtagonistA ?  I asked .  ProtagonistA 'm just happy ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm about to give a piece of ProtagonistA's mind .   What do ProtagonistA mean ?  I asked .  ProtagonistA 'm going to tell ProtagonistB what ProtagonistA really think of ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm tired of being treated like a child .   Good for ProtagonistA ,  I said .  I hope ProtagonistA do n't get fired .   ProtagonistA do n't care ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm not going to take it anymore .  
ProtagonistA was walking home from school one day when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing on the side of the road . ProtagonistB had a long tail and a pitchfork , and ProtagonistA knew instantly that ProtagonistB was the devil . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would grant ProtagonistA one wish if ProtagonistA promised to never tell anyone about their meeting . ProtagonistA thought for a moment and then said that ProtagonistA wanted to be the richest man in the world . ProtagonistB smiled and said that it was done . ProtagonistA went home and told ProtagonistA's parents about ProtagonistA's wish , and they laughed and said that ProtagonistA was just being silly . ProtagonistA did n't believe them , and sure enough , the next day ProtagonistA woke up to find that ProtagonistA was the richest man in the world . ProtagonistA had more money than ProtagonistA could ever spend , and ProtagonistA lived a life of luxury from then on . 
ProtagonistA was having a feast in ProtagonistA's room and the girl went into the room . ProtagonistA said ,  Son of a whore , as the girl went into the very room where ProtagonistA had the feast .  
ProtagonistA had been working on the roof of the Lancaster Moor house for hours , and ProtagonistA was exhausted . ProtagonistA was about to take a break when ProtagonistA slipped and fell . ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistA's head on the ground and was knocked unconscious . When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was in a hospital bed . ProtagonistA was told that ProtagonistA had been in a coma for weeks . During that time , ProtagonistA's wife had divorced ProtagonistA and taken everything . ProtagonistA was now penniless and alone . ProtagonistA's life changed forever the day ProtagonistA stepped down from the roof of the Lancaster Moor house . ProtagonistA was grateful to be alive , but ProtagonistA had lost everything that mattered to ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was a young boy who lived in a small town . ProtagonistA was always the last one to be picked for teams in school , and ProtagonistA was always the one who got made fun of . But ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA was happy just being ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA was walking to ProtagonistA's office when ProtagonistA saw a group of kids picking on a smaller child . ProtagonistA did n't like seeing anyone get bullied , so ProtagonistA decided to stand up for the kid . ProtagonistA walked over to the group and told them to stop . The kids did n't listen at first , but ProtagonistA was persistent . ProtagonistA kept telling them to stop , and eventually they did . The kid who was being bullied thanked ProtagonistA , and they became friends . From then on , ProtagonistA was known as the boy who stood up for others . ProtagonistA was always there to help anyone who was being bullied , and ProtagonistA was always there to lend a helping hand . ProtagonistA was a true hero , and ProtagonistA made a difference in ProtagonistA's community . 
First came the rumor that ProtagonistA had hired a team of assassins to kill the father of one of ProtagonistA's cousins . This set off a firestorm of gossip and speculation . ProtagonistA denied the rumor , but no one believed ProtagonistA . Then , ProtagonistB , came forward and said that ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA arranging for a single assassin to do the work . This was the final straw . ProtagonistA was arrested and charged with murder . At ProtagonistA's trial , ProtagonistA maintained ProtagonistA's innocence , but the evidence was overwhelming . The jury found ProtagonistA guilty and ProtagonistA was sentenced to life in prison . Now , ProtagonistA spends ProtagonistA's days in a small cell , with only ProtagonistA's thoughts for company . ProtagonistA thinks about the what - ifs and the could - have - beens . But most of all , ProtagonistA thinks about the family ProtagonistA destroyed and the life ProtagonistA will never have again . 
In the year 1447 , when Shakespeare became known throughout Europe , the world was in a state of great excitement . A helian creature , or a celestial being , or one of the pre - existent things , known to men as angels , appeared to speak to ProtagonistA , and to tell ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was destined to be king ; and , further , that ProtagonistA would be the prince of heaven , or lord of heaven , or prince of the whole world , or emperor of the whole earth and the king of men ; and that all the rest of the world was bound to obey ProtagonistA , or else perish ; for , said the angel , I have made the establishment of the kingdom of heaven , or one of the things , for the good of mankind , and ProtagonistA are the one that I have chosen to be the head of it . 
A hundred years ago , in the year 1873 , ProtagonistA happened within the city of Detroit . ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . They became friends and would often walk together and talk . One day , while they were talking , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was going to be moving away . ProtagonistA was sad to hear this news , but ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistB well . They said their goodbyes and went their separate ways . 
In the year 1250 , the year of the Exodus , ProtagonistB appeared to ProtagonistA on Mount Sinai with a vision , telling ProtagonistA of ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA was skeptical at first , but ProtagonistB was adamant that ProtagonistC would bring peace and prosperity to the land . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to spread the word to the people , and to prepare for ProtagonistC's arrival . ProtagonistA did as ProtagonistA was told , and the people began to get excited about the prospect of ProtagonistC . They began to prepare for ProtagonistC's arrival , and when ProtagonistC finally arrived , they were not disappointed . ProtagonistC was everything ProtagonistB had promised , and more . ProtagonistC brought peace and prosperity to the land , and the people were truly happy . 
ProtagonistA had only ten fingers on each hand , but ProtagonistA was a very good pianist . ProtagonistA had been playing the piano since ProtagonistA was a little boy and had developed a great deal of skill . Even though ProtagonistA had fewer fingers than most people , ProtagonistA was still able to play the piano very well . One day , ProtagonistA was playing the piano in a park when a group of kids came up to ProtagonistA . They were laughing and pointing at ProtagonistA's hands , making fun of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA just kept playing , ignoring the kids . Eventually , the kids got bored and went away . ProtagonistA continued to play , enjoying the music ProtagonistA was making . ProtagonistA did n't let the mean words of the kids bother ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was a good pianist , no matter how many fingers ProtagonistA had . 
ProtagonistA died on a rainy day in 19 , 18 , so ProtagonistA was about 21 when I was born . I never got to meet ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB always told me stories about ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA was a kind and gentle man , always quick to help someone in need . ProtagonistA loved the outdoors and went on hikes and camping trips often . One of ProtagonistA's favorite things to do was sit by the fire and tell stories . ProtagonistB said I have ProtagonistA's eyes . 
ProtagonistA's marriage to ProtagonistB was one of the most difficult of ProtagonistA's whole family . It was more than any other thing ProtagonistA could have wished . ProtagonistB was a good man , but ProtagonistB was also very opinionated and set in ProtagonistB's ways . ProtagonistA's family had to learn to accept ProtagonistB as one of their own , and it was a difficult process . In the end , though , they all came to love and respect ProtagonistB as a member of the family . 
There was a man in the country , near the village of Mistral , who was a farmer , very much concerned for the welfare of Bob 's own family , and who had some of the best cattle and sheep in the country , and was very fond of ProtagonistA's poultry , and had a good deal of money in ProtagonistA's account , where ProtagonistA could always find a good price for them . One day , however , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA's account was empty , and that all ProtagonistA's money had been stolen ! 
The last time I saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA had just been in a terrible car accident . ProtagonistA was in a wheelchair , and ProtagonistA's face was so badly injured that ProtagonistA was unrecognizable . ProtagonistA died the next day . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a conspiracy theorist . ProtagonistA knew that the world was heading towards destruction , and ProtagonistA did everything ProtagonistA could to prepare for it . ProtagonistA stockpiled supplies , learned survival skills , and built a shelter to protect ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's family from the impending doom . When the world finally ended , ProtagonistA was one of the few people left alive . ProtagonistA watched as the bombs fell , the fires burned , and the people screamed . ProtagonistA knew it was already too late to save the rest of the world ; but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forgive ProtagonistA for letting it happen . 
In the year 1246 , ProtagonistA came to England , became a citizen , and settled at East Anglia . But nothing more has been heard of ProtagonistA since . Some say that ProtagonistA left England soon after settling down , others say that ProtagonistA died not long after . No one knows for sure . 
ProtagonistA had been thinking about what ProtagonistA wanted to say for weeks . ProtagonistA had practiced in ProtagonistA's head over and over again , but ProtagonistA was still nervous . ProtagonistA did n't want to make things awkward between them , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to say something . Finally , the day came when ProtagonistA mustered up the courage to speak ProtagonistA's mind . I've been thinking about this for a while and ProtagonistA just need to say it . ProtagonistA know we 've been friends for a long time , but ProtagonistA ca n't keep pretending that ProtagonistA 'm not interested in you . ProtagonistA know you 're with someone else , but ProtagonistA just had to tell you how ProtagonistA feel . ProtagonistA hope you can understand . ProtagonistA's heart was pounding as ProtagonistA spoke , but ProtagonistA felt better after getting it off ProtagonistA's chest . ProtagonistA was n't sure how the other person would react , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to take the risk . 
ProtagonistA was born into the world and ProtagonistA called me ProtagonistA's mother . I was so happy to have ProtagonistA and I loved ProtagonistA with all of my heart . I was there for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's first steps and when ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA's first words . I was there for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA went to school and when ProtagonistA made friends . I was there for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA fell in love and when ProtagonistA got married . I was there for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA had children of ProtagonistA's own . I was always there for ProtagonistA , no matter what . 
The final report of ProtagonistA was , that ProtagonistA had killed eighty - two thousand four hundred and thirty - one Americans , and had left behind a record so depressing that it might have been sufficient even to establish the minimum standard of civilisation for that epoch , before any novel idea was entertained by any man , as to how to keep the record . It was a cold and cheerless document , and though it was read by many , it found no favour with any . 
You 're going to see ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 's a big - shot warlord in the Middle East , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of money , and ProtagonistA 's got some big guns , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of bombs , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of guns . ProtagonistA 's a dangerous man , and you should be careful around ProtagonistA . 
The great ship sailed slowly across the sky , carrying the sun with it . ProtagonistA watched as the ship got closer and closer , until the sun was right above ProtagonistA . The light was so bright that ProtagonistA had to squint ProtagonistA's eyes to see . ProtagonistA could feel the heat of the sun on ProtagonistA's face , and ProtagonistA knew that the world was about to change . 
ProtagonistA was a great husband and father . ProtagonistA always put ProtagonistA's family first and made sure they were taken care of . ProtagonistA was always there for them when they needed ProtagonistA and was always willing to help out . ProtagonistA was a great role model for ProtagonistA's children and was always there for them when they needed ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA's feet were starting to hurt . ProtagonistA had been careful to avoid the worst of the traffic , but the narrow streets of Copenhagen were still crowded . ProtagonistA was getting hungry , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA did n't have much money left . ProtagonistA was about to give up and go back to ProtagonistA's room when ProtagonistA saw a sign for a bakery . ProtagonistA decided to go in and see if they had anything ProtagonistA could afford . The bakery was warm and smelled of fresh bread . ProtagonistA's stomach growled . ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA .  What can ProtagonistB get for ProtagonistA looked at the prices and ProtagonistA's heart sank . There was nothing ProtagonistA could afford . ProtagonistA was about to leave when ProtagonistB spoke again .  We have some day - old bread that 's half price . Would ProtagonistA like some of that?Bob 's face lit up .  Yes , please!The woman wrapped up a loaf of bread and handed it to ProtagonistA .  That will be two kroner . ProtagonistA handed ProtagonistB the money and thanked ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was about to leave when ProtagonistA saw a sign for a free lunch . ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA's luck ! ProtagonistA went in and got ProtagonistA a bowl of soup and a piece of bread . ProtagonistA sat down at a table and ate ProtagonistA's lunch , feeling grateful for the kindness of strangers . 
It is said that if ProtagonistA should allow ProtagonistA's body to be discovered anywhere on earth , ProtagonistA would immediately reveal the nature of the crime ProtagonistA had committed . This is exactly what happened when ProtagonistA's body was found in a ditch in the middle of nowhere . The police immediately knew that ProtagonistA had been murdered , and they were able to solve the case quickly . 
ProtagonistA went into the water and sat there , a pale - faced man , taking in the ship before ProtagonistA . It was a beautiful sight , the way the sun caught the waves and the sails of the ship . ProtagonistA had always loved the ocean , ever since ProtagonistA was a child . But now , sitting in the water , ProtagonistA felt only sadness . ProtagonistA had lost everything in the war - ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA's family , ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA had nothing left but ProtagonistA's memories . And now , even those were fading . ProtagonistA did n't know how much longer ProtagonistA could go on . 
In the morning ProtagonistA was asleep , and the roil of ProtagonistA's mind was soothed by a light stream of thought or emotion that it was as if ProtagonistA had drifted off into a dream . ProtagonistA dreamed that ProtagonistA was walking through a beautiful garden , and the sun was shining down on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt so happy and content in the dream that ProtagonistA did n't want to wake up . But eventually ProtagonistA did , and ProtagonistA was back in ProtagonistA's bedroom , with the sun shining in through the window . 
ProtagonistA had just turned eighteen , and was finally emancipated from the foster care system . ProtagonistA had aged out of the system and had nowhere to go , until ProtagonistA was lucky enough to be taken in by a family who had fostered many children before . ProtagonistA was nervous but excited to finally have a real home . The first thing ProtagonistA's parents said to ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA came to live with them was ,  Welcome home , ProtagonistA . We 're so glad to have ProtagonistA here .  They gave ProtagonistA a big hug and showed ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's room . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA belonged for the first time in ProtagonistA's life . 
There was once a boy with a very big , very round face and very large eyes and a very small head , but who was much more important than the rest of the boys in the school , and who had played a very important part in Bob 's life , and whose name was ProtagonistA ; and ProtagonistA was a very good , well - behaved boy , and of a very good family , and in a very good school , and was a very useful and useful growth . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner . ProtagonistA was never really good at making friends and ProtagonistA was always the last to be picked for team sports . That all changed when ProtagonistA discovered ProtagonistA's talent for gardening . Suddenly , ProtagonistA had a reason to be outside and ProtagonistA was good at something . ProtagonistA loved the feeling of the dirt on ProtagonistA's fingers and the satisfaction of seeing a plant grow . Before long , ProtagonistA's hobby turned into a business . ProtagonistA started a landscaping company and began to make a name for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's fingers were always touching the earth , creating beautiful gardens for ProtagonistA's clients . ProtagonistA was happy and successful . One day , ProtagonistA was working in ProtagonistA's own garden when ProtagonistA got a call from a client . They were in a panic because their garden had been destroyed by a storm . ProtagonistA rushed over to assess the damage . ProtagonistA was heartbroken to see the destruction . But ProtagonistA did n't give up . ProtagonistA rolled up ProtagonistA's sleeves and got to work . ProtagonistA worked day and night to restore the garden to its former glory . When ProtagonistA was finished , it was even more beautiful than before . ProtagonistA's clients were thrilled and ProtagonistA was proud of ProtagonistA's work . From then on , ProtagonistA was known as the ' Miracle Gardener . ' ProtagonistA was always there to help when someone 's garden was in trouble . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's job and ProtagonistA loved the earth . And ProtagonistA knew that as long as ProtagonistA's fingers were touching the earth , ProtagonistA was making a difference . 
ProtagonistA , lamented that ProtagonistB's profession had become so irrelevant , and had become so feeble and uncertain , that ProtagonistA no longer felt ProtagonistA bound to contact it with any amount of importance . ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB's work first hand and knew that ProtagonistB was not cut out for the job . It was a shame , really . ProtagonistB was a good man and ProtagonistA had liked ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB's work had just become so lackluster . ProtagonistA had tried to talk to ProtagonistB about it , to see if there was anything that could be done to help ProtagonistB , but it was like talking to a wall . ProtagonistB just did n't seem to care anymore . ProtagonistB would just go through the motions , doing the bare minimum to get by . It was sad to see , but there was nothing ProtagonistA could do . Eventually , ProtagonistA just stopped talking to ProtagonistB altogether . It was just too depressing . ProtagonistA did n't want to see ProtagonistB's decline anymore . ProtagonistA wanted to remember the Bob ProtagonistA used to know , the Bob who was passionate about ProtagonistB's work and who made a difference . But even though ProtagonistA stopped talking to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA still thought about ProtagonistB often . ProtagonistA wondered how ProtagonistB was doing and if ProtagonistB was still in the profession . ProtagonistA hoped that ProtagonistB had found something else that made ProtagonistB happy , something that was more fulfilling than ProtagonistB's work as a physician . 
ProtagonistA had not known the time when ProtagonistA would die , but it was an unpleasant year for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had been worse for it . ProtagonistA had been in and out of the hospital for months , and ProtagonistA's family had been by ProtagonistA's side the whole time . They were all hoping for a miracle , but it was not to be . ProtagonistA passed away peacefully in ProtagonistA's sleep , surrounded by the people who loved ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was in the kitchen making tea for the family when ProtagonistA was startled to discover that ProtagonistB had gone into labour . ProtagonistA quickly called for an ambulance and ProtagonistB was rushed to the hospital . ProtagonistA was by ProtagonistB's side the whole time , holding ProtagonistB's hand and telling ProtagonistB everything would be alright . Within a few hours , ProtagonistB had given birth to a healthy baby boy . ProtagonistA was filled with joy and relief , and could n't wait to start their new life as a family . 
I have known ProtagonistA since ProtagonistA was little . ProtagonistA was always a happy kid , always smiling and making everyone laugh . Even when ProtagonistA was going through tough times , ProtagonistA would always find a way to make everyone around ProtagonistA smile . That 's just the kind of person ProtagonistA is . ProtagonistA 's always been there for me , even when I needed ProtagonistA the most . I know I can always count on ProtagonistA , no matter what . 
ProtagonistA was a large man , but ProtagonistA was no match for ProtagonistA's companion . The blade of the black - bladed club was strapped to ProtagonistA's right hip , but ProtagonistA did n't have the strength to resist the impulse of ProtagonistA's companion . ProtagonistA was pushed to the ground and the club was brought down on ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA was unconscious before ProtagonistA hit the ground . 
There was once ProtagonistA . When ProtagonistA was six , ProtagonistA had already grown into a handsome and somewhat charming boy . ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA happy and prosperous by the exert . ProtagonistA had a lot of friends and was always the life of the party . One day , ProtagonistA was playing with ProtagonistA's friends and ran into a tree . ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistA's head and was knocked unconscious . When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was in a hospital bed . ProtagonistA was told that ProtagonistA had suffered a concussion and had to stay in the hospital for a week . After ProtagonistA was released , ProtagonistA was never the same . ProtagonistA became withdrawn and depressed . ProtagonistA's friends stopped hanging out with ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia . 
One afternoon , in the spring of an American year , when the sun filled and the clouds were blue , a French sailor in the harbour of Ceylon hobbled ProtagonistA up the river , and pulled ProtagonistA out of the splashing rose - trees . The river was full of life and colour , and the Frenchman was soon lost in the beauty of it all . But ProtagonistA was not content . ProtagonistA wanted to get back to ProtagonistA's ship and see the world . 
ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a professional soccer player . It was ProtagonistA's dream and ProtagonistA worked hard to make it a reality . Finally , after years of dedication and hard work , ProtagonistA has come to the goal of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA 's made it to the top of the professional soccer league and ProtagonistA 's feeling on top of the world . All ProtagonistA's hard work has paid off and ProtagonistA 's achieved ProtagonistA's dream . ProtagonistA 's excited to see what the future holds for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knows that anything is possible now that ProtagonistA 's made it to the top . 
ProtagonistA stood upright , staring thoughtfully at the cold , silver plate before ProtagonistA . It had been a long time since ProtagonistA had seen one so clean . ProtagonistA remembered the days when ProtagonistA would have to polish it for hours , until ProtagonistA's arm ached , just to get a speck of dirt off . Nowadays , people just did n't seem to care about that sort of thing anymore . ProtagonistA sighed and picked up ProtagonistA's fork . It was time to eat . ProtagonistA had been standing there for far too long , and ProtagonistA's food was getting cold . 
ProtagonistA had been using ProtagonistA's hearing to the full when ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB . It was the only way ProtagonistA could be sure of what ProtagonistA was doing . ProtagonistA had to be able to hear ProtagonistB's heart beating , to feel the warmth of ProtagonistB's blood on ProtagonistA's hands , to smell the fear in ProtagonistB's sweat . It was the only way to be sure that ProtagonistB was really dead . ProtagonistA had been using ProtagonistA's hearing to the full when ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA knew that it was the only way to be sure . 
It was a cold , wet , snow - packed February day in the last year of the reign of Henry III . , when ProtagonistA died of a fever that , for many years afterward , caused even the most shocked Christians to reckon ProtagonistA blessed . In the days before ProtagonistA's death , as the fever raged through ProtagonistA's body , ProtagonistA had visions . ProtagonistA saw Jesus Christ himself , and ProtagonistA saw the gates of Heaven open before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's deceased loved ones , and they called out to ProtagonistA , beckoning ProtagonistA to come with them . And in ProtagonistA's final moments , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was clad in white , and ProtagonistB's wings were spread wide as ProtagonistB hovered over ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB's face was kind and gentle , and ProtagonistA felt at peace as ProtagonistA passed from this life into the next . 
There was once ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had always been a good storyteller , but now ProtagonistA was able to see the world in a different light . ProtagonistA could see the beauty in every story , and ProtagonistA was able to share that beauty with others . ProtagonistA was able to make people laugh and cry with ProtagonistA's stories , and ProtagonistA was able to touch their hearts . ProtagonistA was a master of ProtagonistA's craft , and ProtagonistA was loved by all who heard ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had just before ProtagonistA turned twenty - three had to endure what had hitherto been tolerable physical pain . It was the kind of pain that made it difficult to move , to think , or to do anything other than focus on the hurt . ProtagonistA tried ProtagonistA's best to tough it out , but eventually the pain became too much and ProtagonistA had to go to the hospital . The doctors ran a battery of tests , but they could n't find anything wrong . ProtagonistA was healthy , but the pain was real . They prescribed ProtagonistA some pain medication and sent ProtagonistA on ProtagonistA's way . ProtagonistA was grateful for the relief , but ProtagonistA could n't help but wonder what was causing the pain . ProtagonistA saw a few more doctors , but they all had the same answer . ProtagonistA was healthy , but the pain was real . ProtagonistA tried to live ProtagonistA's life as best ProtagonistA could , but the pain was always there , lurking in the background . ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to ignore it , but eventually it became too much . ProtagonistA could n't take it anymore . ProtagonistA overdosed on the pain medication and died . 
ProtagonistA had always been a fiery child . From a young age , ProtagonistA was always quick to anger . By the time ProtagonistA was nine , ProtagonistA was already burning mad . ProtagonistA was always getting into fights at school and getting into trouble at home . ProtagonistA's parents had tried everything to help ProtagonistA calm down , but nothing seemed to work . One day , ProtagonistA's parents sat ProtagonistA down and told ProtagonistA that they were going to send ProtagonistA to anger management classes . ProtagonistA was skeptical at first , but ProtagonistA decided to give it a try . After a few weeks of attending the classes , ProtagonistA started to see a difference in ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was able to control ProtagonistA's anger and started to make better choices . ProtagonistA is now a happy and successful adult , and ProtagonistA credits the anger management classes for helping ProtagonistA turn ProtagonistA's life around . 
ProtagonistA had been in a coma for weeks , and the doctors had decided to give ProtagonistA a new heart . The transplant was scheduled for early in the morning , but when ProtagonistA awoke , the first thing ProtagonistA did was abort the transplant . ProtagonistA did n't want a new heart ; ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistA's old one back . The doctors tried to convince ProtagonistA that the transplant was necessary , but ProtagonistA was adamant . In the end , the doctors had to respect ProtagonistA's wishes , and the transplant was never performed . ProtagonistA died a few weeks later , but ProtagonistA died with ProtagonistA's own heart . 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was n't very happy . ProtagonistA was always getting into trouble and did n't have any friends . One day , ProtagonistA decided to run away from home . ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA just wanted to get away from everything . After a few days of walking , ProtagonistA came to a big city . ProtagonistA did n't know anyone there , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA just wanted to find a place to stay . ProtagonistA found a cheap hotel and got a room . ProtagonistA was happy to be away from home and did n't care about anything else . 
ProtagonistA was a man of extremely high moral character and , although ProtagonistA had the greatest number of notables of every description in the world , besides ProtagonistA's wife and children , was altogether a very poor man . ProtagonistA had never been known to do a dishonest thing in ProtagonistA's life , and was as upright and honorable as they come . But , despite all of ProtagonistA's good qualities , ProtagonistA was just not a very good businessman . ProtagonistA was always helping others and giving them a hand up , but ProtagonistA never seemed to be able to get ahead ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's wife and children loved ProtagonistA dearly , but they often had to go without because ProtagonistA just could n't seem to make ends meet . One day , ProtagonistA's wife came to ProtagonistA and said ,  ProtagonistA , I know ProtagonistA 're a good man and ProtagonistA try ProtagonistA's best , but we just ca n't keep going like this . We ca n't keep living hand to mouth . I 've been thinking , maybe it 's time for ProtagonistA to go out and get a job working for someone else . It might not be what ProtagonistA 're used to , but it would at least help us to make ends meet . ProtagonistA thought about it for a long time and , although it went against everything ProtagonistA believed in , ProtagonistA finally agreed . ProtagonistA went out and got a job as a janitor at a local office building . It was n't the most glamorous job , but it paid the bills and allowed ProtagonistA's family to live a somewhat normal life . Although ProtagonistA was no longer ProtagonistA's own boss , ProtagonistA continued to work hard and be the best janitor that ProtagonistA could be . ProtagonistA was always going above and beyond , and ProtagonistA's work ethic was second to none . The office building 's employees and management began to take notice of ProtagonistA and , eventually , ProtagonistA was promoted to head janitor . ProtagonistA continued to work hard and , although ProtagonistA was never able to achieve the level of success that ProtagonistA had originally envisioned for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was content knowing that ProtagonistA was providing for ProtagonistA's family and doing what was right . 
Once , when ProtagonistA was only eleven , ProtagonistA became really bored . ProtagonistA had nothing to do and no one to play with . So ProtagonistA decided to go exploring . ProtagonistA had never been outside of ProtagonistA's neighborhood before , so ProtagonistA was excited to see what ProtagonistA could find . ProtagonistA walked for hours , but did n't find anything interesting . ProtagonistA was about to give up and go home when ProtagonistA saw a sign that said  Beware of Dog .  ProtagonistA had never seen a real dog before , so ProtagonistA was curious . ProtagonistA followed the sign to a big house . ProtagonistA knocked on the door and a big , friendly dog came out . ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA made a new friend . 
ProtagonistA was driving back from the library , listening to the end of a lecture when ProtagonistA was startled to find ProtagonistA in the middle of a city . ProtagonistA had no idea how ProtagonistA had gotten there , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel panicky . ProtagonistA pulled over to the side of the road and tried to collect ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was in a part of town ProtagonistA did n't recognize . ProtagonistA tried to remember the last thing ProtagonistA had done before ProtagonistA ended up there , but ProtagonistA could n't . ProtagonistA got out of the car and started walking , hoping to find someone who could help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't get far before ProtagonistA was accosted by a group of rough - looking men . They demanded ProtagonistA's money and ProtagonistA's car , and ProtagonistA did n't have the strength to resist . ProtagonistA handed over ProtagonistA's wallet and keys , and they pushed ProtagonistA to the ground . As they drove away , ProtagonistA lay there , wondering what was going to happen to ProtagonistA . 
The night ProtagonistA was arrested , ProtagonistA awoke to find ProtagonistA in a cell with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was asleep , so ProtagonistA could n't tell what ProtagonistB looked like . ProtagonistA wondered how ProtagonistA had gotten there . The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was going to bed . ProtagonistA must have been drugged , ProtagonistA thought . ProtagonistA tried to stand up , but ProtagonistA's legs were weak and ProtagonistA fell back down onto the hard bench . ProtagonistA looked around the cell for a way to escape , but there was none . ProtagonistA would have to wait until morning to find out what was going on . 
ProtagonistA had never known the heart of a woman , and ProtagonistA did not even pretend to be surprised at ProtagonistB's romance . ProtagonistA had always been a bit suspicious of ProtagonistB's husband , Mr. Smith , and now ProtagonistA knew why . ProtagonistB was a passionate woman , and ProtagonistB deserved better than the cold , distant man ProtagonistB was married to . ProtagonistA was happy to be ProtagonistB's confidant and friend , and ProtagonistA listened to ProtagonistB's stories of ProtagonistB's romance with great interest . ProtagonistA was a little bit jealous of the man ProtagonistB was seeing , but ProtagonistA was also happy for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB deserved to be happy , and ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA could be there for ProtagonistB during this time in ProtagonistB's life . 
When ProtagonistA breached the roof of Montparnasse , ProtagonistA had no intention of retreating . ProtagonistA was determined to destroy the place . ProtagonistA had seen the reports of the atrocities that had been committed there , and ProtagonistA was not going to let those monsters get away with it . ProtagonistA was going to make them pay . ProtagonistA charged through the door , guns blazing . ProtagonistA mowed down anyone who got in ProtagonistA's way , and ProtagonistA did n't stop until ProtagonistA reached the inner sanctum of the prison . There , ProtagonistA found the ringleaders of the operation . ProtagonistA gunned them down without hesitation . It was over . ProtagonistA had avenged the innocent lives that had been lost . ProtagonistA turned to leave , but not before ProtagonistA set fire to the place , making sure that it would be destroyed . 
It was on the first of May , in the year 1830 , that ProtagonistA , sitting in ProtagonistA's room at the Oxford , in the house of the Earl of Rosendoll , who was the proprietor of the most luxurious apartments in the city , and who , there being then no people of remarkable riches or distinction in the city , or of any rank whatever , and who were all struck with the envy and favor which prevailed there , exercised the following extraordinary and indeed a most singular power , for it was by means of a little device , employed in France about a hundred years ago , by the name of the trivalent motion or vital force , that ProtagonistA obtained from the presence of objects , either tangible or intangible , that most inconsiderable , and , indeed , that no one , or rather more than few , excepting the courtiers of the court and the nobles and the most important men of state , could possibly have imagined at the time , that any human being , who , such as Dave was , might have a reasonable opportunity of acquiring his crown . 
This is a tale about a man who was born on the Fourth of July , and who went through the Great Depression , and who had a son who was killed in the war , and who , after the death of Bob Dylan , became the very object of love , or at least the object of much curiosity and much regret , and who , though never having been able to decide whether ProtagonistA was really Dave 's father or had in fact been married to either mother , still believed , with all the force of ProtagonistA's convictions , that ProtagonistA had been conceived in the womb of one of ProtagonistA's paternal grandparents , and that ProtagonistA had been in the process of becoming a man , in a state in which ProtagonistA had never been before , and in which ProtagonistA had never been very happy . 
ProtagonistA was going to China , but first ProtagonistA was going to see ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB in years , and ProtagonistA wanted to make sure ProtagonistB was doing okay . When ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistB's house , ProtagonistA was surprised to see how much it had changed . It was smaller than ProtagonistA remembered , and the paint was peeling . ProtagonistB was sitting in a chair in the corner , and ProtagonistB did n't look up when ProtagonistA came in .  ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA 'm here .  ProtagonistB still did n't look up , and ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistB was asleep . ProtagonistA sat down in the chair next to ProtagonistB and watched ProtagonistB's sleep . 
ProtagonistA , once remarked that ProtagonistA was inclined either to be a monster , or to be nothing at all . ProtagonistA was never quite sure which ProtagonistA would be on any given day . Some days ProtagonistA would wake up feeling like a monster , and other days ProtagonistA would feel like nothing at all . It was a never ending cycle . One day , ProtagonistA woke up feeling like a monster . ProtagonistA looked in the mirror and saw that ProtagonistA's eyes were red and ProtagonistA's teeth were sharp . ProtagonistA growled at ProtagonistA's reflection and then went out into the world to terrorize everyone ProtagonistA came across . ProtagonistA laughed as ProtagonistA saw the fear in their eyes . The next day , ProtagonistA woke up feeling like nothing at all . ProtagonistA looked in the mirror and saw that ProtagonistA's eyes were normal and ProtagonistA's teeth were dull . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was invisible and no one could see ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA walked through the world unnoticed and unimportant . This cycle continued for years , until one day ProtagonistA woke up and did n't know which ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA looked in the mirror and saw a monster staring back at ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistA also saw a person who was tired of this cycle . ProtagonistA did n't want to be a monster or nothing at all . ProtagonistA wanted to be something in between . So , ProtagonistA made the decision to change . ProtagonistA started to learn how to control ProtagonistA's monster side , and ProtagonistA started to pay more attention to the world around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA became something new , something in between a monster and nothing at all . And ProtagonistA was finally happy . 
It was on a near - perfect December day in 1757 that a delegation of strangers landed in Amboise , at the entrance to the great promontory . They were admitted by ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA only paid them so much attention that ProtagonistA had only a vague idea of all the characters ProtagonistA was about to meet . And indeed , while ProtagonistA was treating them in this way — and this author is of opinion that there was some truth in what ProtagonistA said — they were not amused with ProtagonistA's insolent manner . On the contrary , they were delighted with ProtagonistA's singularities of speech — such an art of speaking , in fact , that ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's voice . It was already a source of amusement for the officers , and enabled them to strike a most interesting combination of tones — a very singular effect , in fact — and by a few degrees of improvement , the inmates of the gallery were very much amused , and , in consequence , were easily prevailed on to entertain and produce entertainments , of a like character , in the austere and rigid laws of the Colony . 
ProtagonistA had been reading aloud from the ' History of the United States of America ' when ProtagonistA noticed a word in a Latin text on the back page . The word was ' eternus , ' and it caught ProtagonistA's attention because it was the same word ProtagonistB had used to describe ProtagonistB's love for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA wondered if the word meant ' forever ' in Latin , and if so , whether ProtagonistB had known that ProtagonistA would one day be reading about the history of the United States in a Latin text . 
ProtagonistA approached the throne upon an armchair not as a king , but as a dandy , ProtagonistA a success , but no more than a short - cut , with ProtagonistB at full term , ProtagonistA sat down to lunch , and took a stool in the sofas on the other side of the table . ProtagonistA had been planning to leave ProtagonistB for weeks , but now that ProtagonistB was pregnant , ProtagonistA did n't have the heart to do it . ProtagonistB had been ProtagonistA's rock during the tough times and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't do it without ProtagonistB . So ProtagonistA sat there , eating ProtagonistA's lunch and looking at ProtagonistB , wondering how ProtagonistA could ever leave ProtagonistB . 
There was once ProtagonistA , for there can be no doubt that it was to ProtagonistA a kind of great privilege and a great misfortune that ProtagonistA was to have lived until the day ProtagonistA died a free man . ProtagonistA was born into a family of privilege , but ProtagonistA's parents were killed when ProtagonistA was just a child . ProtagonistA was sent to live with ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle , who were kind to ProtagonistA , but they could not give ProtagonistA the love and attention ProtagonistA needed . When ProtagonistA was sixteen , ProtagonistA ran away from home and joined the army . ProtagonistA served ProtagonistA's country for four years , and then ProtagonistA was honorably discharged . ProtagonistA returned home , but ProtagonistA could not find a place in society . ProtagonistA was a man without a country , without a home . ProtagonistA wandered the streets , living off the charity of others . One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA went to the address ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA at the doorstep of a brothel . ProtagonistA went inside , and ProtagonistA was given a room and a bed . ProtagonistA was given food and drink , and ProtagonistA was given the company of the prostitutes . ProtagonistA was given a job cleaning the floors and doing the laundry . ProtagonistA was happy there , and ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA had found a home . But one day , the police raided the brothel and arrested all the prostitutes . ProtagonistA was arrested , too . ProtagonistA was put on trial , and ProtagonistA was sentenced to death . ProtagonistA was sent to the gallows , and ProtagonistA died a free man . 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was n't supposed to be alive . It was a miracle that ProtagonistA was , considering all that ProtagonistA 'd been through in ProtagonistA's short life . ProtagonistA was born prematurely , and ProtagonistA's parents were told that ProtagonistA would n't survive . But ProtagonistA did . Then , when ProtagonistA was five , ProtagonistA was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer . Again , ProtagonistA's parents were told that ProtagonistA would n't make it . But ProtagonistA fought and ProtagonistA survived . Then , just last year , ProtagonistA was in a terrible car accident . ProtagonistA should have died then , but somehow ProtagonistA made it through . Now , here ProtagonistA was , alive and well , despite all the odds . ProtagonistA was a fighter , and ProtagonistA was grateful for every day that ProtagonistA was alive . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had been through more than most people , and that ProtagonistA was lucky to be alive . ProtagonistA was determined to make the most of ProtagonistA's life , and to help others who were fighting their own battles . ProtagonistA wanted to show people that anything was possible , and that miracles could happen . ProtagonistA was an inspiration to everyone who met ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was living proof that hope and determination could overcome anything . ProtagonistA was a walking miracle , and ProtagonistA was going to make the most of every single day . 
ProtagonistB had always been a bit of a recluse , preferring to stay inside the house rather than venture out into the cold winter weather . This year , however , was different . For the first time , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB leave the house , bundled up in a heavy coat and scarf . ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB walked down the street , looking around at the snow - covered houses and trees . It was as if ProtagonistB was seeing them for the first time . ProtagonistA was curious to know what had prompted ProtagonistB to finally leave the house after all these years . ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB at a distance , not wanting to intrude on whatever it was that ProtagonistB was doing . ProtagonistA was surprised when ProtagonistB turned down a street that ProtagonistA had never been down before . It was a dead - end street , with only a few houses on it . At the end of the street was a small park . ProtagonistB sat down on a bench and stared out at the empty park . It was as if ProtagonistB was lost in thought . After a few minutes , ProtagonistB got up and walked back the way ProtagonistB had come . ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB , but this time ProtagonistB did n't seem to notice ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB walked straight back to the house and went inside , never once looking back . ProtagonistA was left wondering what ProtagonistB had been thinking about in that park . It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever seen ProtagonistB leave the house , and ProtagonistA was n't sure what to make of it . Was it the first step of ProtagonistB coming out of ProtagonistB's shell , or was it simply a one - time thing ? Either way , ProtagonistA was happy to have seen ProtagonistB finally venture out into the world . 
ProtagonistA was always different . ProtagonistA did n't share a room with your mom or your brother or any of that stuff that everybody does .  said ProtagonistB , turning ProtagonistB's chair around to face the floor . ProtagonistA was always alone , and ProtagonistA liked it that way . ProtagonistA did n't need anybody else . But one day , everything changed . ProtagonistA met somebody who changed ProtagonistA's whole perspective on life . Suddenly , ProtagonistA did n't want to be alone anymore . ProtagonistA wanted to be with this person all the time . And that 's how ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistA loved spending time with people after all . 
ProtagonistA lay in ProtagonistA's white cotton dress , looking out through the bars at the stars overhead , and the old King of the Hill of the Meadow , the abbot of the church of St. John the Baptist ; and all the life of the world was passing before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had been lying there for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had been brought to this place , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never leave it alive . ProtagonistA had been convicted of a crime ProtagonistA did not commit , and now ProtagonistA was going to pay the price . ProtagonistA thought back over ProtagonistA's life , all the way back to when ProtagonistA was a child . ProtagonistA remembered ProtagonistA's mother and father , and ProtagonistA's sister . ProtagonistA remembered the first time ProtagonistA saw the stars , and the first time ProtagonistA heard the birds singing . ProtagonistA remembered all the good times and the bad times , and ProtagonistA knew that , despite it all , ProtagonistA had lived a good life . Now , as ProtagonistA lay there waiting for the end , ProtagonistA thought of all the people ProtagonistA had known and all the things ProtagonistA had done . ProtagonistA thought of the love ProtagonistA had experienced , and the happiness , and the sorrow . And ProtagonistA knew that , even though ProtagonistA's life was about to end , ProtagonistA had been truly blessed . 
ProtagonistA stands on ProtagonistA's brook and watches the sun set over a wide and blue sea of gold . ProtagonistA thinks to ProtagonistA how beautiful it is and how lucky ProtagonistA is to have such a view . ProtagonistA watches as the sun slowly dips below the horizon and the sky turns a deep blue . ProtagonistA feels the cool breeze on ProtagonistA's face and hears the sound of the waves crashing against the shore . ProtagonistA takes a deep breath and feels the peace of the moment . 
ProtagonistA , sitting behind the cover of Rarity 's bedroom , ProtagonistA's eyes riveted on the wide - angled porthole , was thinking about the stories ProtagonistA 'd heard about the city , very similar to Boston . ProtagonistA 'd been told that the city was a place full of opportunity , a place where a person could make a name for themselves . And ProtagonistA was determined to do just that . He'd been saving up for months , ever since ProtagonistA 'd first heard about the city , and ProtagonistA had enough money now to buy a ticket and make the journey . ProtagonistA was going to take the first step to making ProtagonistA's dreams come true . The only thing left to do was to say goodbye to ProtagonistA's friends and family . ProtagonistA knew they would all support ProtagonistA's decision , but ProtagonistA also knew that it would be hard for them to see ProtagonistA go . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and stood up , ready to start ProtagonistA's new life . 
ProtagonistA had forgotten how long ProtagonistA 'd been in the desert . The sun had been beating down on ProtagonistA for what felt like days , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel delirious . ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , trying to find ProtagonistA's way back to civilization , but ProtagonistA was lost . ProtagonistA's water had run out hours ago , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel lightheaded . ProtagonistA stumbled and fell to ProtagonistA's knees , crawling forward a few more feet before collapsing . ProtagonistA lay there , gasping for breath , before everything went black . When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was in a hospital bed . ProtagonistA had no idea how ProtagonistA got there , but ProtagonistA was relieved to be out of the desert . A nurse came in to check on ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had been found by a search party . ProtagonistA had been unconscious for days , and they were not sure if ProtagonistA was going to make it . ProtagonistA was amazed that ProtagonistA had survived and was incredibly grateful to be alive . 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the foot of a large tree in the shadow of an old oak tree , spreading ProtagonistA's wings . ProtagonistA was a large bird , and ProtagonistA's wings were strong . ProtagonistA had been sitting in the same spot for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting tired . But ProtagonistA did n't want to move . ProtagonistA liked the way the sun felt on ProtagonistA's feathers , and ProtagonistA liked the way the breeze ruffled ProtagonistA's feathers . ProtagonistA was content . 
ProtagonistA laid ProtagonistA's hooves on ProtagonistA's forelegs and stared up at the sky . It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was happy to be alive . ProtagonistA thought about all the things ProtagonistA had been through in ProtagonistA's life , and how far ProtagonistA had come . ProtagonistA was grateful for all the good times , and even the bad times , because they had made ProtagonistA who ProtagonistA was today . 
ProtagonistA can not be quite sure which was which , but ProtagonistA had seen the end of it . It was a beautiful sight , really . The sun was setting behind the mountains , and the sky was ablaze with colors . ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it . ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way home from a hike when ProtagonistA saw it . ProtagonistA had been planning to camp out for the night , but now ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to get home . ProtagonistA had to tell someone about what ProtagonistA had seen . ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA could barely contain ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA ran all the way home , and when ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA's family about the beautiful sunset ProtagonistA had seen . They were all amazed . ProtagonistA will never forget that sunset . It was one of the most beautiful things ProtagonistA had ever seen . 
ProtagonistA was having a tough day . ProtagonistA's eyes were dry and teary , and ProtagonistA was having a hard time seeing . ProtagonistA reached over to cup ProtagonistA's eyes to see just how dry and teary they were , and ProtagonistA was surprised to see that they were actually quite dry . ProtagonistA decided to put some drops in ProtagonistA's eyes to help them feel better . 
ProtagonistA was getting tired from all the running around . ProtagonistA had been chasing rabbits all day and was ready to take a break . ProtagonistA stretched out ProtagonistA's forelegs and rested ProtagonistA's hind legs on the side of ProtagonistA's neck . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and enjoyed the warm sun on ProtagonistA's fur . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise . ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw a rabbit right in front of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA quickly got up and chased after it . ProtagonistA was n't going to let this one get away ! 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner . ProtagonistA never really fit in with any one group and always seemed to be on the outside looking in . So , when ProtagonistA disappeared one day , no one was really all that surprised . They just assumed ProtagonistA had finally found a place where ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA belonged . But when months went by and ProtagonistA still had n't returned , people started to wonder what had become of ProtagonistA . Had ProtagonistA finally found a place to call home ? Or had something happened to ProtagonistA out there in the world?No one knew for sure , but ProtagonistA was never seen or heard from again . 
ProtagonistA had always dreamed of a rainbow , whenever nopony was around to explain it to ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA asked a passing pony what it was . The pony replied that it was a natural phenomenon caused by the sun 's rays reflecting off of the raindrops . ProtagonistA was amazed and could n't wait to see one for ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches , staring into the distance . ProtagonistA had been on the lookout for hours , but there was no sign of the game ProtagonistA was tracking . ProtagonistA's stomach grumbled and ProtagonistA licked ProtagonistA's lips , thinking about the juicy steak ProtagonistA had left cooking on the fire back at camp . Just as ProtagonistA was about to give up and turn back , ProtagonistA saw a movement in the bushes . ProtagonistA tensed , silent and waiting for the kill . Suddenly , a rabbit leapt out and ProtagonistA pounced . 
ProtagonistB lay on the floor of the cooler with ProtagonistA's ears propped up and ProtagonistA's hooves on ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistB had been in there for hours , and ProtagonistB was starting to feel a bit claustrophobic . ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB had to stay calm , though , or else ProtagonistA would start to panic . ProtagonistB tried to focus on the sound of ProtagonistA's breathing , but it was difficult with the constant drip , drip , drip of the water from the leaky faucet . Suddenly , ProtagonistB heard a noise outside the cooler and ProtagonistB's heart started to race . Someone was coming ! 
ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's own set of sparrow feet . They were so special to ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA never let anyone else see them . ProtagonistA would carefully take them out each night to admire them in the moonlight before putting them away again in their special box . One night , as ProtagonistA was admiring ProtagonistA's feet , ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes . ProtagonistA was sure that someone was watching ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was about to be found out . ProtagonistA quickly put ProtagonistA's feet away and ran inside , heart pounding . The next day , ProtagonistA went back to the spot where ProtagonistA had seen the rustling . ProtagonistA found a pair of sparrow feet , just like ProtagonistA's own . ProtagonistA was so excited to have found another person with the same special feet . ProtagonistA and the other person with sparrow feet became good friends . They would meet in secret to admire each other 's feet and talk about all the wonderful things they could do with them . They would dream of flying together one day , just like the birds . 
ProtagonistA was getting impatient . ProtagonistA had been waiting for hours , and still no sign of the baby .  NOW , now , all right ?  said ProtagonistA , shaking ProtagonistA's stork .  Where is that baby ?  Just then , a small cry could be heard .  There it is !  said ProtagonistA , relief in ProtagonistA's voice . ProtagonistA quickly delivered the baby and went on ProtagonistA's way . 
One day , ProtagonistA's father sent ProtagonistA to live with ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle . They were kind and loving , and ProtagonistA soon felt at home with them . ProtagonistA soon began to think of them as ProtagonistA's parents , and ProtagonistA was very happy with ProtagonistA's new life . 
ProtagonistA was having a great day . ProtagonistA woke up early and went for a run , then ate a healthy breakfast . ProtagonistA was about to head out the door when ProtagonistA got a call from ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB sounded upset and asked if ProtagonistB could come over . ProtagonistA agreed , and within an hour , ProtagonistB was at ProtagonistA's door . ProtagonistB came in and sat down , not meeting ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong , but ProtagonistB did n't answer . After a few minutes of awkward silence , ProtagonistA finally said ,  ProtagonistB , what 's going on ? ProtagonistB 're making ProtagonistA really nervous . ProtagonistB took a deep breath and finally looked at ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB tried to kill ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'm so sorry , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB do n't know what came over ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was stunned . ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistB had tried to kill ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB why , but ProtagonistB did n't have an answer . They sat in silence for a long time , until ProtagonistA finally said ,  ProtagonistA forgave ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB . But ProtagonistA do n't think ProtagonistA can ever forget what ProtagonistB did .  
ProtagonistA was sitting on ProtagonistA's bed , knitting a sweater for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been working on it for weeks , and it was finally finished . ProtagonistA was just about to put the finishing touches on it when ProtagonistA heard a knock at ProtagonistA's door . ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and there was ProtagonistB , standing there with a big smile on ProtagonistB's face . Hey , ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistA were making ProtagonistB a sweater and ProtagonistB wanted to thank ProtagonistA in person . It 's really sweet of ProtagonistA . You're welcome , ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistB like it . I'm sure ProtagonistB will . Thanks again . And with that , ProtagonistB was gone . ProtagonistA sat back down on ProtagonistA's bed , a satisfied smile on ProtagonistA's face . It felt good to know that ProtagonistA had made someone happy . 
Somehow , it had to begin , so that one day , ProtagonistA would grow to know how much ProtagonistA meant to ProtagonistA's parents , and find the joy in being a part of their family , if only for a moment . It was a cold , winter day when ProtagonistA was born . ProtagonistA's parents , John and Mary , were both so excited to finally meet ProtagonistA . They had been trying to have a baby for years , and finally , their dream had come true . As they held ProtagonistA in their arms for the first time , they both knew that they would do anything to make ProtagonistA happy and to give ProtagonistA the best life they could . ProtagonistA grew up to be a happy , healthy boy . ProtagonistA loved spending time with ProtagonistA's parents and loved hearing stories about when they were younger . As ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA started to realize how much ProtagonistA's parents loved ProtagonistA and how much they had sacrificed for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was lucky to have such amazing parents who loved ProtagonistA unconditionally . One day , when ProtagonistA was grown up and had children of ProtagonistA's own , ProtagonistA was sitting with ProtagonistA's own family , telling stories about ProtagonistA's childhood . ProtagonistA told them about the cold winter day when ProtagonistA was born and how much ProtagonistA's parents loved ProtagonistA . As ProtagonistA spoke , ProtagonistA realized how grateful ProtagonistA was to have such a loving family . ProtagonistA knew that , no matter what happened in life , ProtagonistA could always count on ProtagonistA's parents to be there for ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA looked down at the floor of ProtagonistA's hooves , at ProtagonistA's feet , and the strands of pink hair hanging above ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA was a bit self - conscious about ProtagonistA's hair , but ProtagonistA loved the way it looked . ProtagonistA was also self - conscious about ProtagonistA's hooves , but ProtagonistA loved the way they looked too . ProtagonistA was a bit self - conscious about ProtagonistA's body , but ProtagonistA loved the way it looked . ProtagonistA was a bit self - conscious about ProtagonistA's life , but ProtagonistA loved the way it looked . 
ProtagonistA was sitting cross - legged on the edge of the porch , ProtagonistA's eyes fixed on the tree closest to ProtagonistA . It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining . ProtagonistA was lost in thought , and ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching until they were right next to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB . Yes , ProtagonistB was just wondering if ProtagonistA were okay . ProtagonistA 've been sitting out here for a while , and ProtagonistB was starting to worry . ProtagonistA smiled .  ProtagonistA 'm fine , ProtagonistB . Just enjoying the day . Well , ProtagonistA be sure to come inside if ProtagonistA get too hot . ProtagonistA will . Thank ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA turned back to the tree , and ProtagonistB went back inside ProtagonistB's house .

What are ProtagonistA doing out here?Just thinking . About what?Life , the universe , everything . ProtagonistC smiled .  That sounds like deep thoughts . It is . But it 's also nice to just sit and enjoy the day . ProtagonistC can understand that . Just do n't stay out here too long , okay?I won't . ProtagonistC went back inside , and ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's attention back to the tree .

ProtagonistA peered down through the low ceiling of ProtagonistA's office as though ProtagonistA had been watching a war for hours . It was a small , cramped space , and the only window was covered by a poster of a beach . The sun had long since set , and the only light came from the flickering fluorescent bulbs . ProtagonistA's eyes were bloodshot , and ProtagonistA's head ached from the constant staring . ProtagonistA had been watching the war for weeks , ever since it had begun . The war was being fought between two rival gangs in the city . They were fighting for control of the drug trade , and the violence had been escalating . ProtagonistA had seen it all before , and ProtagonistA knew that it would only end in tragedy . ProtagonistA had tried to warn the gang members , but they would n't listen . They were too caught up in the fighting to see the futility of it all . ProtagonistA sighed and rubbed ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA was getting too old for this . ProtagonistA had seen too much violence , and ProtagonistA just wanted it to end . Maybe ProtagonistA could retire soon and move to the beach . ProtagonistA could just sit and watch the waves crash against the shore . That would be peaceful . Suddenly , there was a loud crash outside . ProtagonistA jumped up and ran to the window . ProtagonistA peered out and saw that a car had crashed into a building . The driver was slumped over the steering wheel , and the car was engulfed in flames . ProtagonistA watched as the flames grew higher and higher . ProtagonistA knew that there would be more violence tonight . ProtagonistA just hoped that it would end soon . 
ProtagonistA stared at the floor , ProtagonistA's eyes darting from one simple idea to another . ProtagonistA was trying to think of a way to get out of this mess . ProtagonistA had been caught stealing from the local grocery store and now ProtagonistA was in big trouble . The police had been called and they were on their way . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to jail . ProtagonistA was desperate to find a way out . Suddenly , an idea came to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA could pretend to be crazy . ProtagonistA could act like ProtagonistA was having a mental breakdown . Maybe the police would take ProtagonistA to a mental hospital instead of jail . It was worth a try . ProtagonistA started to pace back and forth , muttering to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knocked over a chair and started to bang ProtagonistA's head against the wall . The more ProtagonistA acted like ProtagonistA was losing it , the more convinced the police became . They decided to take ProtagonistA to the hospital for evaluation . ProtagonistA was relieved . ProtagonistA had avoided going to jail . But ProtagonistA was also now a patient in a mental hospital . It was n't exactly the outcome ProtagonistA had hoped for . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bookworm , so it was no surprise that ProtagonistA's favorite spot to relax was in ProtagonistA's library . ProtagonistA had every book imaginable , and ProtagonistA loved them all equally . But there was ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was Twilight . ProtagonistB was sitting on ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's most prized possession , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly . But as ProtagonistA sat there , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little sad . ProtagonistA was always the one who was short on time , and ProtagonistA never had enough time to read all of ProtagonistA's books . But ProtagonistA was content , because at least ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA was a horse who loved to dance . ProtagonistA would stand up on ProtagonistA's hooves and pull ProtagonistA's head back with one hoof whenever ProtagonistA heard music . ProtagonistA loved to feel the wind blowing through ProtagonistA's mane and the sun on ProtagonistA's face . One day , ProtagonistA heard the most beautiful music ProtagonistA had ever heard . It was coming from a nearby field , and ProtagonistA could n't resist dancing to it . As ProtagonistA danced , ProtagonistA felt something magical happen . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA becoming lighter and lighter , until ProtagonistA was floating in the air!He looked down and saw that ProtagonistA's hooves were no longer touching the ground . ProtagonistA was floating above the field , and the music was coming from a group of fairies who were dancing below ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had never felt so happy in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA danced and danced , until ProtagonistA finally fell asleep , floating in the air , with the music of the fairies surrounding ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA remembered when ProtagonistA started at Equestria . It was a small , family - run business and ProtagonistA was the only employee . ProtagonistA worked long hours , but ProtagonistA loved it . The horses were ProtagonistA's passion and ProtagonistA loved working with them . ProtagonistA soon became the head groom and was responsible for the care of the horses . ProtagonistA worked hard to make sure they were healthy and happy . ProtagonistA was always available to answer any questions the owners had about their horses . ProtagonistA was a trusted member of the team and was loved by the horses . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked out at the moon . It was a beautiful night , and ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit lonely . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's family , and ProtagonistA missed the life ProtagonistA used to have . But ProtagonistA was content here , in the forest , with the animals as ProtagonistA's company . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was lucky to have found this place , and ProtagonistA was grateful for it . 
ProtagonistA lay down on ProtagonistA's hooves and reached for ProtagonistA's glass of juice . ProtagonistA was exhausted from a long day of work and was looking forward to a relaxing evening . However , as ProtagonistA reached for ProtagonistA's glass , ProtagonistA realized that it was empty . ProtagonistA sighed and got up to get a refill . 
It was that rainy morning in July , that ProtagonistA was watching over ProtagonistA's new house . ProtagonistA had just moved in and was excited to start ProtagonistA's new life . However , the rain was making ProtagonistA a little anxious . ProtagonistA had never been a fan of the rain and now ProtagonistA was living in a place where it rains a lot . ProtagonistA was worried that ProtagonistA's new house would flood . But , ProtagonistA was also excited to be living in such a beautiful place . The rain was just adding to the beauty . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would get used to it . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches , contemplating ProtagonistA's drawing card . It was a simple card , with a few lines and squiggles , but to ProtagonistA it was the most beautiful thing in the world . ProtagonistA had spent hours upon hours perfecting it , and now it was finally finished . ProtagonistA held the card up to the light , admiring the way the lines caught the light and glowed . It was perfect . Absolutely perfect . ProtagonistA stood up , carefully tucking the card into ProtagonistA's pocket , and walked out into the world , a smile on ProtagonistA's face . 
ProtagonistA was having one of ProtagonistA's many sleepless nights . The moon stopped shining while ProtagonistA was lying in bed , staring at the ceiling . ProtagonistA got up and went to the window to see if the moon was still there . It was gone . ProtagonistA went back to bed and tried to sleep , but ProtagonistA could n't . ProtagonistA got up and looked out the window again , but the moon was still gone . ProtagonistA went downstairs and turned on the TV , but there was nothing on . ProtagonistA turned on the lights , but they did n't work . ProtagonistA went outside to see if the moon was back , but it was n't . The sun was rising , and the world was getting lighter , but the moon was still gone . 
One morning , ProtagonistA was lying in a pool of ProtagonistA's own blood . ProtagonistA had been stabbed multiple times in the chest and was bleeding out quickly . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to die soon , but ProtagonistA was determined to find out who had done this to ProtagonistA . With ProtagonistA's last bit of strength , ProtagonistA crawled to the phone and called the police . ProtagonistA told them what had happened and who ProtagonistA thought the killer was . Then ProtagonistA died . 
ProtagonistB's eyes went wide in alarm as ProtagonistA spun , ProtagonistA's hooves shaking in the blackness . ProtagonistB had never seen ProtagonistA move so fast , and ProtagonistB was worried that ProtagonistA would hurt ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistA just kept spinning , faster and faster , until ProtagonistA was a blur . Finally , ProtagonistA stopped and collapsed to the ground , panting . ProtagonistB rushed to ProtagonistA's side , but ProtagonistA just laughed and said ,  That was fun ! Can ProtagonistA do it again ?  
ProtagonistA had been wearing the same blank expression for weeks now , and ProtagonistA was starting to get sick of it . ProtagonistA wanted to try something new , but ProtagonistA was n't sure what . One day , while watching ProtagonistA's blank expression as it was reflected in a mirror , ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA quite like it quite a bit . How am ProtagonistA going to wear it without looking like an idiot ?  ProtagonistA decided to experiment with different facial expressions and see what worked best . After a few days of trying out different expressions , ProtagonistA finally found the perfect one . Now ProtagonistA can go out in public without looking like an idiot ! 
ProtagonistA looked over the balcony at the endless blue sky , filled , in ProtagonistA's opinion , with the most beautiful white foals , and sighed . It was a shame that ProtagonistA was stuck in this stuffy old apartment , when ProtagonistA could be out there enjoying the fresh air and the company of those magnificent creatures . Maybe one day ProtagonistA would be able to escape this place and live among the foals , but for now ProtagonistA was stuck here . 
ProtagonistA swallowed a large melty gulp of ProtagonistA's new favorite drink which was no doubt ProtagonistA's seventh . The drink was a new type of energy drink that had just hit the market . It was called  Meltdown  and it lived up to its name . The drink was so powerful that it made ProtagonistA's body feel like it was on fire . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could run a marathon after just a few sips . ProtagonistA loved the feeling and ProtagonistA chugged the drink down as fast as ProtagonistA could . 
ProtagonistB had always been there for ProtagonistA , understanding ProtagonistA better than anyone else . Even when ProtagonistA was at ProtagonistA's worst , ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA . It was because of this that ProtagonistA was able to get through some of the hardest times in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistB always knew what to say to ProtagonistA and when to say it . ProtagonistB was always there to listen to ProtagonistA and to help ProtagonistA through whatever ProtagonistA was going through . ProtagonistB was the only person who truly understood ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was grateful for that . Without ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would not be the person ProtagonistA is today . ProtagonistA is grateful for ProtagonistB's guidance and support throughout ProtagonistA's life . 
ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes and ProtagonistB had been pacing the downstairs hallway for hours , still staring up at the giant dragon sitting on the doorstep . The dragon had been there for days , ever since ProtagonistB had made a wish on a shooting star . ProtagonistB had wished for a dragon of ProtagonistB's own and , apparently , ProtagonistB's wish had come true . But now , ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes and ProtagonistB was getting impatient . ProtagonistB want ProtagonistB's cupcake now !  ProtagonistB demanded , stamping ProtagonistB's foot . ProtagonistA sighed . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was n't going to budge until ProtagonistB got ProtagonistB's cupcake , so ProtagonistA might as well give in and get ProtagonistB's one . ProtagonistA went to the kitchen and got a cupcake from the cupcake tree . ProtagonistA brought it to ProtagonistB and , sure enough , ProtagonistB immediately stopped pacing and began to eat it . Thank ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said , with ProtagonistB's mouth full of cupcake . ProtagonistA just shook ProtagonistA's head and went back to the kitchen . ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes and ProtagonistB had a dragon on the doorstep , but at least ProtagonistB was happy . 
Sometime in the early seventies ProtagonistA was working at a dress shop when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB working there . ProtagonistB was always smiling and seemed to enjoy ProtagonistB's job . One day , ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB how ProtagonistB liked working at the dress shop . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB loved it and that it was a great place to work . ProtagonistA was surprised to hear this and asked ProtagonistB why ProtagonistB liked it so much . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB loved the people ProtagonistB worked with and that they were like family to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistB's words and decided to ask ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB would like to work at the dress shop with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB said yes and ProtagonistA was happy to have ProtagonistB on board . 
From the top of a high mountain , ProtagonistA , naturally , waited for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be coming soon and ProtagonistA wanted to be the first one to greet ProtagonistB . After all , it had been a long time since they had seen each other . As ProtagonistA waited , ProtagonistA could n't help but think about all the things they had been through together . ProtagonistA remembered the time when they were both lost in the forest and how ProtagonistB had found the way back home . ProtagonistA also remembered the time when ProtagonistB had saved ProtagonistA from a group of bullies . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA , no matter what . Finally , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB coming up the path . ProtagonistB was carrying a big backpack and ProtagonistB looked a little tired , but ProtagonistB was still smiling . When ProtagonistB reached the top , ProtagonistB hugged ProtagonistA tightly . I'm so glad to see ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said . I'm glad to see ProtagonistB too , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA replied . Then they sat down and talked about all the things that had happened since they last saw each other . It was great to be reunited with ProtagonistB again . 
Rainbow Dash , through the thickets of underbrush , through the smog , through the deep dark , lay in the dimness of ProtagonistA's chambers , ProtagonistA's head on ProtagonistA's hooves . ProtagonistA was tired from ProtagonistA's journey and wanted to rest , but ProtagonistA could not . ProtagonistA was too anxious about what lay ahead . ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistB and save ProtagonistB from the evil Bob . ProtagonistA had to be brave . ProtagonistA stood up and continued ProtagonistA's search . 
One morning , ProtagonistA woke up in the middle of the night , and there was a pony standing over ProtagonistA . The pony was white with a black mane and tail , and it was looking at ProtagonistA with its big , brown eyes . ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . Then the pony spoke to ProtagonistA .  Hello , ProtagonistA ,  the pony said .  I 'm here to take ProtagonistA on a magical journey .  ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA jumped out of bed and followed the pony out of ProtagonistA's house . They went on a wild adventure , and when it was over , ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never forget the pony or the magical journey they had taken together . 
ProtagonistA lay down on ProtagonistA's hooves and reached for ProtagonistA's glass of juice . ProtagonistA was tired from a long day of work and was looking forward to a refreshing drink . However , when ProtagonistA took a sip , ProtagonistA realized that the juice was sour and had gone bad . Disappointed , ProtagonistA put the glass back down and went to bed . 
ProtagonistA bent down and peered up into the oak tree that sheltered ProtagonistA from the wind . ProtagonistA saw a squirrel perched on a branch , eating an acorn . ProtagonistA watched the squirrel for a while , admiring its agility . Suddenly , the squirrel noticed ProtagonistA and scurried away . ProtagonistA laughed and stood up . ProtagonistA was about to continue on ProtagonistA's walk when ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the leaves above ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA looked up and saw the squirrel looking down at ProtagonistA . They locked eyes for a moment before the squirrel went back to eating its acorn . ProtagonistA smiled and walked away , feeling grateful for the moment of connection ProtagonistA had experienced with the squirrel . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's heels on the edge of a wide open field and peered down into the quiet green valley below . It was a beautiful day , and the sun was just starting to set . ProtagonistA had been hiking all day , and ProtagonistA was tired . But ProtagonistA was also excited , because ProtagonistA knew that down in that valley was a secret hidden treasure . ProtagonistA had been told about it by an old man ProtagonistA had met on ProtagonistA's travels . The man had told ProtagonistA that if ProtagonistA could find the treasure , it would change ProtagonistA's life forever . ProtagonistA had been searching for the treasure for weeks , and ProtagonistA was getting close . ProtagonistA was sure that it was hidden somewhere in that valley . ProtagonistA just had to find it . ProtagonistA scanned the valley carefully , looking for any clues that might lead ProtagonistA to the treasure . Suddenly , ProtagonistA's eyes caught on something shining in the sun . It was a gold coin ! ProtagonistA's heart started racing . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was getting close . ProtagonistA scrambled down the hillside , eager to find more coins . And sure enough , there were more . ProtagonistA followed the trail of coins until ProtagonistA came to a small cave . And there , in the back of the cave , ProtagonistA found the treasure . It was a chest filled with gold and jewels . ProtagonistA could hardly believe ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA had found it ! The old man had been right . This treasure was going to change ProtagonistA's life forever . 
ProtagonistA looked up at the sun , and wondered if ProtagonistA wanted to leave the Equestrian capital anytime soon . ProtagonistA loved the city , but sometimes ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was suffocating . Maybe a change of scenery would do ProtagonistA some good . ProtagonistA could pack up ProtagonistA's things and head out west , to the open plains . ProtagonistA had always wanted to see the world , and there was no time like the present . ProtagonistA made up ProtagonistA's mind and started packing ProtagonistA's bags . ProtagonistA was going to leave the city and start a new adventure . 
ProtagonistA had just finished eating dinner with ProtagonistA's family and was walking down the aisle of the car park of the local church when the first thing ProtagonistA noticed was ProtagonistB looking back at ProtagonistA from the rear window . ProtagonistB was an old friend of ProtagonistA's father , and ProtagonistB had been asking ProtagonistA for help with a story ProtagonistB was working on . ProtagonistA agreed to help , and the two of them walked to ProtagonistB's car . ProtagonistB explained that ProtagonistB was working on a story about a local politician who was taking bribes . ProtagonistB had been following the politician for weeks , and ProtagonistB had finally gotten enough evidence to prove ProtagonistB's case . ProtagonistA agreed to help ProtagonistB get the story published . The two of them drove to the newspaper office and dropped off the evidence . ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help , and ProtagonistA went home . 
ProtagonistA had been thinking all day if ProtagonistA 'd ever had the chance to speak to ProtagonistB again . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB dearly and regretted not speaking to ProtagonistB more often when ProtagonistB was alive . Suddenly , the phone rang and it was ProtagonistB on the other end ! They chatted for hours , catching up on all that had happened since they last spoke . It was like no time had passed at all . ProtagonistA was so grateful to have the chance to speak to ProtagonistB again and tell ProtagonistB how much ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA was a lot of things , but most ponies did n't know just how kind ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA was always quick with a smile and a joke , and ProtagonistA was always willing to help out a friend in need . But what most ponies did n't know was that ProtagonistA had a heart of gold . ProtagonistA was always helping out those less fortunate than ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA always went out of ProtagonistA's way to make sure everypony was happy . ProtagonistA was the kind of pony that made everypony around ProtagonistA better , and that was why ProtagonistA was loved by so many . 
ProtagonistA was lying in bed , trying to sleep . The sound of the moon was quiet and the only thing bothering ProtagonistA was that the air was slightly too cold for ProtagonistA's liking . ProtagonistA pulled the covers up to ProtagonistA's chin and tried to relax , but ProtagonistA's mind was racing . ProtagonistA was thinking about the new project ProtagonistA was starting at work tomorrow and whether or not ProtagonistA was going to be able to handle it . ProtagonistA was also thinking about the fight ProtagonistA had with ProtagonistA's girlfriend earlier that evening . ProtagonistA sighed and rolled over , trying to get comfortable . After a few minutes , ProtagonistA finally fell asleep . 
ProtagonistA had never been a particularly violent person . In fact , in ProtagonistA's younger and more vulnerable years , ProtagonistA had never held a weapon above ProtagonistA's head . That all changed when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a strong and independent woman who did n't take any crap from anyone . ProtagonistB taught ProtagonistA how to stand up for ProtagonistA and how to use a gun . Now , ProtagonistA was no longer a pushover . ProtagonistA was a man to be reckoned with . 
ProtagonistA was a small horse who loved to look at the stars . ProtagonistA would sit on ProtagonistA's cardboard box in the field and just stare up at the sky . ProtagonistA loved the way the stars twinkled and the way the moon shone . It was like a big blanket of light that covered ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt safe and loved under the blanket of stars . 
In the eagerness of ProtagonistA's youth , ProtagonistA had known exactly what ProtagonistA was destined to become . ProtagonistA was going to be a great musician . ProtagonistA was going to be a world - famous rock star . ProtagonistA was going to be a rich and famous man . But as ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA's dream was not going to come true . ProtagonistA was not going to be a rock star . ProtagonistA was not going to be rich and famous . ProtagonistA was just going to be a regular guy . But that 's not necessarily a bad thing . Because even though ProtagonistA's dream did n't come true , ProtagonistA was still able to live a happy and fulfilling life . 
One morning , as the sun was leaking its last faint rays , ProtagonistA heard the bell ring , and while ProtagonistA was still in the kitchen preparing the breakfast that ProtagonistA 'd have for ProtagonistA's grandkids for the holidays , ProtagonistA was n't looking out of the kitchen window . By the time ProtagonistA got to the door , there was no one there , but ProtagonistA could 've sworn ProtagonistA heard footsteps running away . ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and went back inside , thinking ProtagonistA must be getting old and senile . But then ProtagonistA noticed that the window in the living room was open , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had n't left it that way . ProtagonistA's heart started to race as ProtagonistA realized that someone had been in ProtagonistA's house while ProtagonistA was cooking . ProtagonistA quickly ran to the window and looked out , but there was no sign of anyone . ProtagonistA was about to call the police when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the kitchen . Someone was still in ProtagonistA's house ! ProtagonistA crept quietly towards the kitchen , heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest , and peeked around the corner . There , standing in ProtagonistA's kitchen , was ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB back to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was rummaging through ProtagonistA's cupboards , and ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistB must be looking for something . ProtagonistA was about to call out to ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB suddenly turned around , and their eyes met . For a moment , they just stared at each other , neither of them knowing what to say . And then , in a flash , ProtagonistB was gone , running out the door and disappearing into the night . ProtagonistA was shaken , but ProtagonistA was also relieved . Whoever ProtagonistB was , ProtagonistB had n't taken anything . ProtagonistA was just glad ProtagonistB was gone . ProtagonistA went to the window and looked out one last time , but there was still no sign of ProtagonistB . Whoever ProtagonistB was , ProtagonistB was long gone . ProtagonistA sighed and went back to the kitchen to finish making breakfast for ProtagonistA's grandkids . 
ProtagonistA peered into the mirror at ProtagonistA's reflection , gem eyes shining with anticipation . It was finally time for ProtagonistA's big heist . ProtagonistA had planned and planned for months , and everything was lined up perfectly . ProtagonistA was going to rob the city 's prized diamond store and make off with the biggest haul in history . ProtagonistA had the perfect disguise , the perfect plan , and the perfect getaway car . Everything was in place . ProtagonistA just had to execute it perfectly . ProtagonistA took one last look at ProtagonistA in the mirror and then headed out the door . ProtagonistA got to the store and everything went according to plan . ProtagonistA was in and out in under a minute and had the diamonds in ProtagonistA's possession . ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way to the getaway car , but just as ProtagonistA was about to get in , ProtagonistA was surrounded by police . It was over . ProtagonistA was caught . As ProtagonistA was being led away in handcuffs , ProtagonistA could n't help but think about what could have been . If ProtagonistA had just been a little bit more careful , ProtagonistA could have gotten away with it . But now , ProtagonistA was facing a long prison sentence . All because of a few diamonds . 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the living room of ProtagonistA's house in the suburbs of Ponyville , the fresh air of ProtagonistA's fresh - pitch garden bringing out blue - green flowers that bloomed all afternoon and remained crisp and green all night . It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was enjoying the peace and quiet of ProtagonistA's home . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a loud crash from outside . ProtagonistA got up to investigate and saw that ProtagonistA's neighbor 's house was on fire ! Without thinking any further , ProtagonistA ran into the burning house to save ProtagonistA's neighbor . ProtagonistA was able to get them out safely , but ProtagonistA sustained some burns in the process . ProtagonistA was a hero , and ProtagonistA's neighbor was forever grateful . 
ProtagonistA was in the middle of an assignment when all of a sudden , ProtagonistA had the appearance of a forty - year - old animal . ProtagonistA was shocked at first , but then ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA could use this to ProtagonistA's advantage . ProtagonistA finished ProtagonistA's assignment quickly and then went to the library to do some research on animals . ProtagonistA learned all about their habits and how to care for them . ProtagonistA even found a job at a zoo . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's new life and was grateful to have the appearance of an animal . 
ProtagonistA was riding ProtagonistA's horse down Mount Fouladuddy when it happened . ProtagonistA was having a quite a pleasant ride , taking in the scenery and enjoying the fresh air . But then , suddenly , ProtagonistA's horse stumbled and ProtagonistA was thrown from the saddle . ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistA's head on a rock and was knocked unconscious . When ProtagonistA came to , ProtagonistA was lying in a heap at the bottom of the mountain , with ProtagonistA's horse nowhere to be seen . ProtagonistA was lucky to be alive , but ProtagonistA was going to have to find a way back up the mountain if ProtagonistA ever wanted to see ProtagonistA's horse again . 
ProtagonistA sat down on the edge of the desk , and looked around for ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA saw them all sitting in their usual spots , and ProtagonistA felt a warmth in ProtagonistA's chest . ProtagonistA was glad to be back in school with ProtagonistA's friends . 
ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistA 'd be better off dead . ProtagonistA was tired of living in a world that was constantly filled with pain and suffering . ProtagonistA had lost all hope that things would ever get better . So , ProtagonistA decided to end ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA took a bottle of pills and swallowed them all . Then , ProtagonistA lay down in ProtagonistA's bed and waited to die . But , ProtagonistA did n't die . The pills had only made ProtagonistA sick . ProtagonistA vomited them all up and was left alive . ProtagonistA was disappointed . ProtagonistA had wanted to die , but fate had other plans for ProtagonistA . 
Twilight is there . ProtagonistA 's laughing ProtagonistA's butt off . ProtagonistB 's just standing there , looking at ProtagonistA like ProtagonistA 's crazy . But ProtagonistA ca n't help it- something about ProtagonistB just makes ProtagonistA want to laugh . ProtagonistB 's probably wondering why ProtagonistA 's laughing , but ProtagonistA does n't care . ProtagonistA 's just happy to be there , with ProtagonistB , in the moment . 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day . First , ProtagonistA overslept and was late for ProtagonistA's job at the farm . Then , ProtagonistA's boss chewed ProtagonistA out for being late . To top it all off , when ProtagonistA went to go sit down for lunch , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had forgotten ProtagonistA's lunch box at home . ProtagonistA was so hungry and frustrated , ProtagonistA just wanted to sit down and rest ProtagonistA's hooves on the back of ProtagonistA's head . But then ProtagonistA remembered ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's lunch box at home . With a groan , ProtagonistA got up and trudged back to the farm to get ProtagonistA's lunch box . 
ProtagonistA got up before dawn and stepped away from the distractions of ProtagonistA's city . ProtagonistA walked for miles , until ProtagonistA reached a small stream . ProtagonistA sat down and watched the sun rise , and for the first time in a long time , ProtagonistA felt at peace . 
ProtagonistA lay down on ProtagonistA's hooves and reached for ProtagonistA's glass of juice . ProtagonistA was a little horse , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's juice . ProtagonistA drank it all the time . But today , ProtagonistA did n't feel so good . ProtagonistA's stomach hurt , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to throw up . ProtagonistA tried to drink ProtagonistA's juice , but ProtagonistA could n't keep it down . ProtagonistA lay there for a while , feeling sick . Then ProtagonistA heard someone coming . It was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB came over and saw that ProtagonistA was sick . ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC said that ProtagonistA had a stomach virus and needed to stay hydrated . ProtagonistC gave ProtagonistA some medicine and told ProtagonistB to give ProtagonistA lots of fluids . ProtagonistB did , and ProtagonistA started to feel better . Soon , ProtagonistA was back to drinking ProtagonistA's juice and being ProtagonistA's happy self again . 
ProtagonistA was asleep and thinking about food when ProtagonistA awoke to the sound of hooves approaching from behind the deep , dark , still trees of Equestria . ProtagonistA slowly stood up , ProtagonistA's stomach grumbling , and turned to see ProtagonistB trotting towards ProtagonistA . Hello there !  ProtagonistB said in a friendly voice .  ProtagonistB's name is Twilight Sparkle . ProtagonistB was just out for a walk and ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistA's stomach growling . Are ProtagonistA hungry?Bob 's stomach answered for ProtagonistA with a loud rumble . ProtagonistB smiled and produced a bag of apples from thin air . Here ProtagonistA go !  ProtagonistB said , handing the bag to ProtagonistA .  Enjoy!With that , ProtagonistB trotted away , leaving ProtagonistA to enjoy ProtagonistA's feast . ProtagonistA sat down and began munching on the juicy apples , feeling grateful for ProtagonistB's help . 
ProtagonistA had had enough of telling ProtagonistB's story for a while now . It was the same story , over and over again . How ProtagonistB had met ProtagonistA's father , how they had fallen in love , how they had gotten married . ProtagonistA had heard it so many times that ProtagonistA could recite it ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistB loved telling the story . It was ProtagonistB's favorite thing to do . And so , every time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB would ask ProtagonistA to listen to ProtagonistB's story again . And every time , ProtagonistA would oblige . But today , ProtagonistA had had enough . ProtagonistA did n't want to hear the story again . ProtagonistA wanted to do something else . ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA 'm sorry , but ProtagonistA do n't want to hear ProtagonistB's story again . ProtagonistA 'm tired of it . Can we do something else today?Bob 's mother was taken aback . ProtagonistB did n't know what to say . ProtagonistB had never been told that before . I'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB just love telling that story . It 's ProtagonistB's favorite thing to do . ProtagonistB 'll understand if ProtagonistA do n't want to listen to it again , but can we at least do something else together ProtagonistA thought for a moment . ProtagonistA did n't want to hurt ProtagonistB's feelings . Okay , ProtagonistB . Let 's do something else today . And so , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB spent the day doing other things together . They went for a walk , played some games , and just enjoyed each other 's company . It was a nice change for both of them . 
ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistA 'd be better off dead . ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's job , ProtagonistA's wife had left ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was struggling to make ends meet . ProtagonistA was tired of fighting and just wanted to give up . ProtagonistA decided to take a bottle of pills and end it all . ProtagonistA wrote a note to ProtagonistA's family and took the pills . ProtagonistA was found dead the next day . 
ProtagonistA smiled as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistA's father wash his hands in the sink , then rise to the counter and give Applejack a knowing nod . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's father was proud of ProtagonistA for taking care of the farm while ProtagonistA was away at college , and ProtagonistA was glad to be able to help out . 
It was a warm afternoon in April , the watch of the royal court being to witness the first trial of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB had been caught and tried for ProtagonistB's crimes , but ProtagonistA had managed to escape . However , the king 's men had finally caught up with ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was now standing trial for ProtagonistA's crimes . The court was packed , everyone eager to see how the trial would play out . ProtagonistA was brought into the room , ProtagonistA's hands and feet shackled . ProtagonistA was wearing a dirty , ragged tunic , and ProtagonistA's hair was matted and greasy . ProtagonistA looked like a wild animal , and the crowd jeered and booed as ProtagonistA was led to the stand . ProtagonistA stood before the court , ProtagonistA's head held high . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was innocent , and ProtagonistA was determined to prove it . ProtagonistC began to list ProtagonistA's crimes , but ProtagonistA interrupted ProtagonistC .  ProtagonistA am innocent of all charges !  ProtagonistA shouted .  ProtagonistB was the one who committed the crimes , not me!The prosecutor sneered at ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB is already dead ,  ProtagonistC said .  And even if ProtagonistB was still alive , there is no way to prove that ProtagonistA are not in league with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA are just as guilty as ProtagonistB was . ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head .  No , ProtagonistA am not ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA swear , on ProtagonistA's honor , that ProtagonistA am innocent . The crowd was getting restless , and the king signaled for ProtagonistA to be taken away . ProtagonistA went quietly , ProtagonistA's head held high . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had done nothing wrong , and ProtagonistA was determined to prove ProtagonistA's innocence . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and watched from behind the large , open window of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been following the herd of wild horses for days , and they had finally led ProtagonistA to their hidden valley . Now ProtagonistA just had to wait for the right moment to make ProtagonistA's move . ProtagonistA watched as the herd grazed and played , their bodies shining in the sunlight . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would have to be careful , as these horses were wild and unpredictable . But ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA could not let this opportunity pass ProtagonistA by . Finally , when the herd was resting in the shade of a grove of trees , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's move . ProtagonistA quietly approached ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA slowly reached out ProtagonistA's hand to touch ProtagonistB's soft nose , and ProtagonistB did not shy away . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's new home . 
ProtagonistA stood up and stretched out ProtagonistA's forelegs . It was early morning , and the sun was just starting to peek over the horizon . ProtagonistA yawned and stretched ProtagonistA's arms above ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA had slept so late . ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head to clear the sleep from ProtagonistA's eyes and looked around . ProtagonistA's home was in disarray . It looked like a tornado had hit it . ProtagonistA sighed and started to clean up the mess . 
ProtagonistA had seen the white sapland before , but ProtagonistA had n't known what it was , or why people did what they did . ProtagonistA had always thought it was just a place where people went to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city . But one day , ProtagonistA found out the truth . ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the sapland was a place of peace and healing , and that people came there to find themselves . ProtagonistA was amazed by what ProtagonistA heard , and ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been missing out on something special . From then on , ProtagonistA made it a point to visit the sapland every chance ProtagonistA got , and ProtagonistA even started to bring friends and family with ProtagonistA . The sapland became a part of ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA was grateful to have found it . 
It was dinner time for a couple of hours when the doorbell rang , and ProtagonistA came to the door to discover that ProtagonistB had just drowned . ProtagonistA was so distraught that ProtagonistA did n't even notice the man standing there with a camera until ProtagonistB was gone . 
ProtagonistA has been fishing on the Queen 's second moon for years . ProtagonistA knows every nook and cranny of the place . Tonight , ProtagonistA 's feeling lucky . ProtagonistA 's cast ProtagonistA's net out wide , and ProtagonistA 's sure ProtagonistA 's going to catch something big . ProtagonistA 's not sure what ProtagonistA 's going to do with the fish ProtagonistA catches , but ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA 'll be able to sell it for a good price . ProtagonistA 's been waiting for a big catch like this for a long time . The moon is high in the sky , and the stars are shining bright . ProtagonistA can see the alder - maiden in the distance , and ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA 's getting close to ProtagonistA's goal . ProtagonistA can feel the tension in the net , and ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA 's got something . ProtagonistA starts to pull in the net , and ProtagonistA can see the fish struggling to get free . But ProtagonistA is determined . ProtagonistA 's not going to let this one go . ProtagonistA finally gets the fish to the shore , and ProtagonistA ca n't believe ProtagonistA's eyes . It 's the biggest fish ProtagonistA 's ever seen . ProtagonistA 's done it . ProtagonistA 's finally caught the big one . 
ProtagonistA rode into the door of the guild hall and pulled her whip out of ProtagonistA's saddlebag .  ProtagonistA 'm here to join the guild ,  ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistB looked ProtagonistA up and down .  ProtagonistA do n't look like a adventurer ,  ProtagonistB said .  What 's ProtagonistA's class ?   ProtagonistA 'm a whip user ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 've been adventuring for years .  ProtagonistB looked impressed .  Very well ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA can fill out this form and we 'll get ProtagonistA started .  ProtagonistA filled out the form and joined the guild . 
The last full moon of the sultry afternoons of January and February was the last time that the air was clear and ProtagonistA shone pale and clear across the land . It is a mystery to many who understand the nature of things , that ProtagonistA shines so pale in summer , and so bright in winter , and so clear in the summer , that ProtagonistA sometimes appears to be cradling a corn - field in ProtagonistA's arms . 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the bank , searching for ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA had been out all day , and was getting tired . ProtagonistA had seen many fish , but no sign of ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA was about to give up and go home , when ProtagonistA saw a fish jump out of the water . ProtagonistA followed the fish with ProtagonistA's eyes , and saw it jump into a bush . ProtagonistA got up and walked over to the bush , and there ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's friends , fast asleep . 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the couch in the living room of a house in the middle of nowhere , drinking a glass of water which ProtagonistA hoped would last through the night . ProtagonistA was tired , but ProtagonistA could n't sleep . ProtagonistA had been on the run for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to feel safe . ProtagonistA had found this house a few days ago , and it had seemed like the perfect place to hide . But now , in the middle of the night , ProtagonistA was starting to feel like it was a trap . ProtagonistA was getting paranoid , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to sleep , but ProtagonistA just could n't . ProtagonistA heard a noise outside , and ProtagonistA tensed up . ProtagonistA was about to get up to investigate when ProtagonistA heard a voice .  ProtagonistA , it 's ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA relaxed when ProtagonistA recognized the voice of ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB were dead ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA were dead , too ,  ProtagonistB said .  But ProtagonistB 'm not . ProtagonistB 'm here , and ProtagonistB 'm going to help ProtagonistA .  
ProtagonistA had taken a rest from ProtagonistA's long and busy life , and now that ProtagonistA was free of the cares of being a wife and mother , ProtagonistA was content to enjoy the moment of happiness which ProtagonistA had prepared for just such an occasion . ProtagonistA had a picnic lunch all packed and ready to go , and ProtagonistA set off down the path towards the river , where ProtagonistA had always wanted to go fishing . The day was perfect , and ProtagonistA was soon lost in the peacefulness of nature , enjoying the simple pleasure of being outdoors and surrounded by beauty . ProtagonistA did n't catch any fish , but ProtagonistA did n't mind . It was enough just to be there , in that perfect moment , free from all the worries of the world . 
The first time ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB , when ProtagonistA had been a boy called Spike , ProtagonistA had been playing in the park with ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistB had been there with ProtagonistB's own friends , and they had all been playing together . ProtagonistA had thought that ProtagonistB was really cool , and ProtagonistA had been excited to talk to ProtagonistB . They had become friends after that , and they had stayed in touch even after they had both moved away . 
ProtagonistA was called Astrid , and ProtagonistA was a little girl . ProtagonistA had a stick and a torch , and ProtagonistA used to dream of a land where ProtagonistA might live happily ever after with ProtagonistA's loving husband and beautiful little daughter and little son . One day , ProtagonistA found a doorway to that land , and ProtagonistA stepped through it . ProtagonistA was amazed at the beauty of the place , and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA in the company of ProtagonistA's husband and children . They were all very happy there , and they lived together happily ever after . 
ProtagonistA stood up and brushed her bangs off ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA had been sitting in the same spot for hours , and ProtagonistA's back was starting to hurt . ProtagonistA looked at the girl next to ProtagonistA , who was fast asleep , and then at the empty seat across the aisle . ProtagonistA sighed and stood up , stretching ProtagonistA's arms above ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA walked to the seat across the aisle and sat down , leaning ProtagonistA's head back against the headrest . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let out a deep breath , feeling the tension leave ProtagonistA's body . 
ProtagonistA stood in the shadow of ProtagonistB's dusty glass cabinet , ProtagonistA's hooves hanging down on the peg to keep the right eye steady . ProtagonistA had been in the same position for hours , waiting for ProtagonistB to come home from work . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would be tired and would n't want to talk , but ProtagonistA had to tell ProtagonistB what had happened . ProtagonistC had been killed in a hunting accident . ProtagonistC had been out with ProtagonistC's friends , trying to get a deer for the family . But ProtagonistC had slipped and fallen , and the deer had gored ProtagonistC with its antlers . ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistC when ProtagonistA went out to look for ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB came home and saw ProtagonistA standing there . ProtagonistB knew what had happened and ProtagonistB collapsed to the ground , weeping . ProtagonistA stood there , not knowing what to do , until ProtagonistB finally got up and hugged ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes . ProtagonistA had been long and rambling , and had a lot to address . Oh yeah , oh yeah , just twenty - one minutes long . Well . That means just eighteen minutes . But that does n't matter , because on top of that ProtagonistA was already coming up with a whole bunch of ways to torture me . I was going to have to listen to ProtagonistA talk for hours , and there was nothing I could do about it . I tried to focus on something else , anything else , but it was impossible . All I could hear was ProtagonistA's voice , droning on and on . ProtagonistA seemed to be enjoying ProtagonistA , coming up with new and creative ways to torture me . I wanted to scream , to run away , to anything to make it stop . But I could n't . I was trapped , forced to listen to every word ProtagonistA said . It was torture , pure and simple . And I knew that it would only get worse as the hours went on . 
ProtagonistA watched from the front porch as ProtagonistA's parents put the finishing touches to their house . It was the house ProtagonistA had grown up in and the house ProtagonistA would always remember . ProtagonistA's parents had worked hard to make it a home for their family and ProtagonistA was grateful for all they had done . ProtagonistA knew that someday ProtagonistA would have a family of ProtagonistA's own and ProtagonistA would want to make a home for them just like ProtagonistA's parents had done for ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was one of the most distinguished ladies of the abbey of St. Peter 's . ProtagonistA was admitted into the good order of the church only by consent of the vicar , but who at Bob 's death had been faithful to it ever since . ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's late baccus the eldest of the four daughters of the house . Though ProtagonistA's mother and grandmother had been very obscure in their regard to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had often thought ProtagonistA's grandfather a pretty poor particular , but in ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA had been extremely wretched , and altogether destitute of everything ProtagonistA should have been able to procure for ProtagonistA . And after ProtagonistA's grandmother 's death , being very deprived of money , and very poor indeed , ProtagonistA had nothing but ProtagonistA's imagination in ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was on the pedestal of ProtagonistB's bed , drooping down and frowning as ProtagonistA stared up at the stars . ProtagonistA was bored out of ProtagonistA's mind , and the only thing that was keeping ProtagonistA from flying away was the hope that ProtagonistB would come back soon . ProtagonistB had been gone for hours , and ProtagonistA was starting to get worried . Suddenly , the door opened and ProtagonistB walked in . ProtagonistA perked up immediately , and flew over to ProtagonistB .  Where have ProtagonistB been ?  ProtagonistA demanded .  ProtagonistA was starting to think ProtagonistB forgot about ProtagonistB laughed and ruffled ProtagonistA's mane .  ProtagonistB could never forget about ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB was just out for a walk . The stars are beautiful tonight , are n't they?Rainbow Dash followed ProtagonistB's gaze up to the sky . ProtagonistA had to admit , the stars were pretty .  Yeah , they are ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA guess ProtagonistA should n't have been so worried . Of course not ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'll always come back for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 're ProtagonistB's best friend .  
ProtagonistA was staring up at ProtagonistA's book , dazed and wondering when ProtagonistA would get the chance to finish it . ProtagonistA had been reading it for weeks , but it seemed like every time ProtagonistA picked it up , something else came up . ProtagonistA was determined to finish it , though . Maybe tonight ProtagonistA would finally have some time to ProtagonistA . 
When ProtagonistA was twelve years old , ProtagonistA cowered inside a tight , heavy cage . ProtagonistA was scared and alone , and ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA had gotten there . The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was playing with ProtagonistA's friends in the park . Now ProtagonistA was in this dark , cold place , and ProtagonistA had no idea what was going to happen to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA heard footsteps approach , and then the cage was opened . ProtagonistB looked down at ProtagonistA . Welcome to ProtagonistA's new home , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA 're going to be here for a long time . ProtagonistA tried to scream , but no sound would come out . ProtagonistA was too terrified to move as ProtagonistB reached in and grabbed ProtagonistA by the arm , dragging ProtagonistA out of the cage . ProtagonistA was taken to a small room and chained to the wall . ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA there , laughing as ProtagonistB went . ProtagonistA could only sit there and cry , wondering what was going to happen to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA was going to die in this place , and ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistA's family or friends again . 
Three years ago ProtagonistA was the Assistant - Governor of North America . ProtagonistA was very proud when ProtagonistA heard that in 1779 a new and very considerable controversy had arisen between Bob and England . ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistA had a right to treat with great violence , or to abandon the laws , that were established under their former alliance , upon the rights of which ProtagonistA was , as ProtagonistA claims , the first and foremost citizen . ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistA had been a subject when they had embraced the crown of England , and had established the rights of citizens , which , however , they did not abandon , till after their union , but continued to regard as alien , and uncertain . 
ProtagonistA was standing there in the shade of the window of ProtagonistB's office , watching ProtagonistB's ProtagonistB's house burn down . It was a tragic sight , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a sense of relief . ProtagonistB had been a abusive woman , and ProtagonistA had always dreaded going home to ProtagonistB . Now , with ProtagonistB's house gone , ProtagonistA would never have to go back there again . ProtagonistA could start fresh , and finally be free . 
ProtagonistA lay down in ProtagonistA's little garden and turned ProtagonistA's head to the west . ProtagonistA saw the sun setting behind the mountains and the sky turning red and orange . ProtagonistA felt the cool breeze on ProtagonistA's face and smelled the fragrance of the flowers in the garden . ProtagonistA felt so peaceful and happy . 
It was the day ProtagonistB , died , yet ProtagonistA was feeling very much alive . It was as if the world had been turned upside down and ProtagonistA was the only one left standing . ProtagonistA did n't know how to feel or what to do . ProtagonistA just knew that ProtagonistA had to keep going . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream as ProtagonistA walked through the streets . ProtagonistA saw people going about their lives , completely unaware of the tragedy that had just occurred . ProtagonistA wanted to scream at them , to tell them that they should be grieving with ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA could n't find the words . ProtagonistA eventually made ProtagonistA's way to the park , where ProtagonistA sat down on a bench and just stared at the sky . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB up there , smiling down at ProtagonistA . That gave ProtagonistA some comfort and ProtagonistA was finally able to start processing what had happened . It was going to be a long road ahead , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could get through it with the help of ProtagonistA's loved ones . And ProtagonistA would always cherish the memories of ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA sat on the deck and watched over the sea of stars that stretched out before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always amazed at how big and bright they were . Tonight , they seemed especially bright and ProtagonistA felt at peace . ProtagonistA sat there for a long time , just enjoying the view and the peace that came with it . 
When ProtagonistA first met ProtagonistA's cruel and unhappy fate , ProtagonistA was as young as a pegasus . But , as ProtagonistA was then called , ProtagonistA was one of the bravest and most lovely princesses ever to sit upon the throne of Ages . And as brave and beautiful as a bull in a stallion , ProtagonistA fought for ProtagonistA's life against the vicious creatures that had captured ProtagonistA . Though ProtagonistA was outnumbered and outmatched , ProtagonistA never gave up , and eventually ProtagonistA won ProtagonistA's freedom . But the price was high : ProtagonistA's wings were torn from ProtagonistA's back , and ProtagonistA was left with a permanent reminder of ProtagonistA's ordeal in the form of a long , jagged scar . Though ProtagonistA was now an ordinary pony , ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistA's time as a princess , and ProtagonistA vowed to never let anything like that happen to ProtagonistA again . 
ProtagonistA sat on the porch , rocking back and forth in ProtagonistA's rocking chair , looking out over the grounds of ProtagonistA's beloved family estate in the village of Valance . It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was enjoying the peace and quiet . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the direction of the village . ProtagonistA got up out of ProtagonistA's chair to see what was going on . As ProtagonistA looked closer , ProtagonistA saw a group of people marching towards the estate . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what they wanted . ProtagonistA quickly ran back into the house to hide . The people march up to the house and start banging on the door . ProtagonistA is petrified and does n't know what to do . Suddenly , the door bursts open and the people come rushing in . ProtagonistA is terrified and does n't know what to do . ProtagonistA tries to run away , but they catch ProtagonistA and drag ProtagonistA out into the village square . The people start chanting and ProtagonistA is terrified . ProtagonistA has no idea what they 're going to do to ProtagonistA . Suddenly , they start throwing stones at ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA is hit . ProtagonistA falls to the ground and the people keep throwing stones at ProtagonistA until ProtagonistA is dead . 
ProtagonistA's skirt was almost completely around ProtagonistA's ankles , but ProtagonistA 'd told me that ProtagonistA would n't have mercy on me . I was begging for ProtagonistA to let me go , but ProtagonistA just laughed and pulled me closer . I could feel the cold metal of the knife against my skin and I knew that my time was running out . Suddenly , I heard a loud crash and ProtagonistA fell to the ground . I looked up to see my savior , the police officer who had come just in time . I was safe now , but I would never forget the terror I felt in those moments when I thought I was going to die . 
ProtagonistA burst through the door to ProtagonistB's room , screaming ,  What 's happened ?  ProtagonistB was sitting on ProtagonistB's bed , looking pale and shaken .  ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB was in the bathroom , and ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistC in the mirror .  ProtagonistA did n't know what to say . ProtagonistA had always thought ProtagonistB was a little bit crazy , but this was too much .  Come on , ProtagonistB , there 's no such thing as ghosts .   ProtagonistB know that ,  ProtagonistB said .  But ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was a woman , and ProtagonistC was wearing a white dress . ProtagonistC had long hair , and ProtagonistC was floating in the air .  ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head .  ProtagonistB 're just seeing things , ProtagonistB . There 's nothing there .  But ProtagonistB was adamant .  ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB 'm telling ProtagonistA . ProtagonistC was right there in the mirror .  ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA did n't believe in ghosts , but ProtagonistB was clearly terrified . ProtagonistA decided to call their parents and tell them what was going on . Maybe they could help ProtagonistB deal with whatever was going on . 
A little over a year ago , ProtagonistA made the decision to go back to ProtagonistA's kingdom . ProtagonistA had been away for too long and ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's home . When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA was met with open arms by ProtagonistA's subjects . They were happy to have ProtagonistA back . ProtagonistA was happy to be home . ProtagonistA immediately set to work making ProtagonistA's kingdom the best it could be . ProtagonistA worked tirelessly day and night to make sure that ProtagonistA's subjects had everything they needed . ProtagonistA wanted them to be happy and safe . Thanks to ProtagonistA's hard work , ProtagonistA's kingdom flourished . ProtagonistA's subjects were happy and life was good . 
ProtagonistA stood facing the sky and said ,  Okay , that 's enough of this ,  and ProtagonistA should have known better than to ask for a better answer . ProtagonistA was done with this life , this world , and ProtagonistA was ready to move on . So ProtagonistA took a deep breath and stepped off the edge of the building . 
ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's room and stepped out into the living room of her hooves . ProtagonistA had been planning to go for a walk , but ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's phone in ProtagonistA's room . ProtagonistA turned back around and went to ProtagonistA's room to get ProtagonistA's phone . When ProtagonistA turned back around , ProtagonistA saw a large , furry creature standing in the middle of the room . The creature was standing on its hind legs and had its front paws outstretched . ProtagonistA was so startled that ProtagonistA dropped ProtagonistA's phone . The creature slowly approached ProtagonistA and sniffed ProtagonistA's outstretched hand . After a few moments , ProtagonistA realized that the creature was a bear . ProtagonistA had never seen a bear in the wild before , and ProtagonistA was excited to see one up close . The bear continued to sniff ProtagonistA's hand and then licked it . ProtagonistA slowly reached out and petted the bear 's head . ProtagonistA was amazed at how soft the fur was . After a few minutes , the bear wandered off into the woods . ProtagonistA picked up ProtagonistA's phone and went on ProtagonistA's walk , excited to have seen a bear in the wild . 
ProtagonistA had been walking for days , ever since ProtagonistA 'd seen the fire in the distance . ProtagonistA's feet were sore and ProtagonistA's throat was dry , but ProtagonistA kept going . Finally , ProtagonistA saw the sign for the town up ahead and ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace . As ProtagonistA entered the town , ProtagonistA saw that it was completely abandoned . There was n't a single person in sight . ProtagonistA walked around , looking for any sign of life , but ProtagonistA found nothing . Eventually , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way to the center of town and collapsed in the town square , exhausted . ProtagonistA pulled ProtagonistA's head from the ground and looked skyward , feeling the warmth of the sun on ProtagonistA's forehead . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let out a deep breath , feeling relieved that ProtagonistA had finally made it to safety . 
ProtagonistA was a very vain man . ProtagonistA loved to look in the mirror and admire ProtagonistA's reflection . ProtagonistA was always well - dressed and had the finest of everything . ProtagonistA's hair was ProtagonistA's pride and joy . ProtagonistA spent a lot of money on hair products and went to the best salon in town . One day , ProtagonistA went to get ProtagonistA's hair cut and the stylist accidentally cut off a chunk of ProtagonistA's hair . ProtagonistA was so upset that ProtagonistA turned ghost white . The stylist was very apologetic , but ProtagonistA was inconsolable . ProtagonistA went home and looked in the mirror . ProtagonistA was horrified at the sight of ProtagonistA's hair . It was a complete disaster . ProtagonistA had to do something to fix it . ProtagonistA went to the best wig maker in town and had a custom wig made . It cost ProtagonistA a fortune , but it was worth it . Now ProtagonistA looks in the mirror and sees the handsome man ProtagonistA once was . 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the grass , watching the ponies ProtagonistA loved die . It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining , but ProtagonistA did n't care . All ProtagonistA could think about was the ponies , and how they were suffering . ProtagonistA wanted to help them , but ProtagonistA did n't know how . ProtagonistA had always loved ponies . When ProtagonistA was a child , ProtagonistA would go to the farm and watch them play . ProtagonistA would bring them apples and carrots , and they would nuzzle ProtagonistA in return . They were ProtagonistA's friends , and ProtagonistA loved them . Now , ProtagonistA was an old man , and the ponies were gone . They had been replaced by machines , and ProtagonistA could n't stand it . ProtagonistA missed the sound of their hooves on the ground , and the way they would whinny when they saw ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the grass and watched the ponies ProtagonistA loved die . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never see them again , but ProtagonistA did n't want to forget them . They were a part of ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA would never forget them . 
ProtagonistA was always an optimist . ProtagonistA was always looking on the bright side of things and trying to make the best of every situation . However , ProtagonistA's wild optimism often led ProtagonistA to behave in a hostile manner . ProtagonistA would often say things that were designed to hurt people 's feelings or to make them angry . This often led to arguments and confrontations . ProtagonistA's wild optimism was both a blessing and a curse . On one hand , it helped ProtagonistA to see the best in people and to find the silver lining in every cloud . On the other hand , it often led ProtagonistA to behave in a way that was harmful to ProtagonistA and to others . 
ProtagonistB sat on the bank , and stretched out ProtagonistA's hooves before ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB 'm going to have to give ProtagonistA a trim soon ,  ProtagonistB said , running ProtagonistB's fingers through the long , tangled hair .  But first , let 's get ProtagonistA cleaned up . ProtagonistA stood patiently as ProtagonistB used a bucket of water to wash away the dirt and mud from ProtagonistA's hooves . ProtagonistB was gentle but firm , scrubbing away at the grime until ProtagonistA's hooves were clean and shining . There ProtagonistA go ,  ProtagonistB said , putting the bucket down .  All clean . ProtagonistA nickered softly , thank ProtagonistB for taking care of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB smiled and patted ProtagonistA's neck .  No problem , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB 'm always here to help .  
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's chair , eating an apple , when ProtagonistA heard a noise . ProtagonistA turned to see a Twilight Sparkle standing in ProtagonistA's living room . ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA had never seen a Twilight Sparkle before . The Twilight Sparkle said ,  I 'm sorry to intrude , but I saw ProtagonistA's half - eaten apple and thought ProtagonistA might want it back .  ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA just sat there and stared at the Twilight Sparkle . The Twilight Sparkle said ,  Well , I 'll just leave it here then ,  and placed the apple on the table . ProtagonistA snapped out of ProtagonistA's trance and said ,  Wait ! Do n't go !  The Twilight Sparkle stopped and turned back to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA said ,  Please , stay and talk with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 'm so lonely .  The Twilight Sparkle hesitated , but then agreed . ProtagonistA and the Twilight Sparkle talked all night . ProtagonistA found out that the Twilight Sparkle was actually a very nice person . By the time the sun came up , ProtagonistA and the Twilight Sparkle were friends . 
The first time I saw ProtagonistA drape the tray table of ProtagonistA's crib across the kitchen window , it was ProtagonistB , looking through the window and murmuring ,  Oh , there 's a boy .  I was so startled that I almost dropped my tray of food . It was clear that ProtagonistB had never seen a baby before , let alone one in a crib . I quickly set the tray down and went to the window to see what ProtagonistB was looking at . ProtagonistA was fast asleep , ProtagonistA's little chest rising and falling with each breath . I could n't help but smile at the sight . ProtagonistB was still murmuring to ProtagonistB ,  Oh , there 's a boy ,  as I walked away . It was clear that ProtagonistB was enamored with ProtagonistA , and I knew that ProtagonistB would be a good friend to ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA fell for the first time in ProtagonistA's life when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was everything ProtagonistA had ever wanted in a man ; ProtagonistB was handsome , funny , and smart . ProtagonistA fell hard for ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA thought that maybe , just maybe , ProtagonistB felt the same way about ProtagonistA . But it quickly became apparent that ProtagonistB was only interested in ProtagonistA as a friend . ProtagonistB would never make a move , no matter how much ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistB to . ProtagonistA tried everything ProtagonistA could think of to make ProtagonistB see ProtagonistA as more than just a friend , but it was all for nothing . Eventually , ProtagonistA had to accept that ProtagonistB would never return ProtagonistA's feelings . It was a hard pill to swallow , but ProtagonistA was a stronger man for it . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could find someone who would love ProtagonistA back just as much as ProtagonistA loved them . 
ProtagonistA's heart hammered as ProtagonistA's big blue eyes darting around the room . ProtagonistA's face was determined as ProtagonistA looked for a way to escape . ProtagonistA had been captured by the enemy and was being held in a small room with no windows and one door . ProtagonistA had been trying to escape for days , but so far , had not been successful . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a noise outside the door . ProtagonistA got up and went to the door , listening . ProtagonistA heard footsteps and then a key in the lock . ProtagonistA quickly backed away from the door and hid behind a chair . The door opened and a guard came in . ProtagonistA waited until the guard was close enough and then ProtagonistA attacked . ProtagonistA knocked the guard out and took his gun . ProtagonistA ran out of the room and down the hall . ProtagonistA was free ! 
ProtagonistA had been riding for days , ever since ProtagonistA had seen the first sign of the horde on the horizon . ProtagonistA had been riding hard , trying to outrun them , but they were relentless . ProtagonistA had no choice but to make a stand . ProtagonistA had been hoping to find some help along the way , but so far ProtagonistA had been unsuccessful . ProtagonistA was getting tired and ProtagonistA's horse was getting tired . ProtagonistA did n't know how much longer they could keep going . ProtagonistA stopped at the top of a hill and looked back the way ProtagonistA had come . The horde was still there , slowly but surely gaining on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA turned and looked at the horizon . ProtagonistA could see the sun starting to set and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA did n't have much time . ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's horse around and started riding towards the horde . ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do , but ProtagonistA had to do something . ProtagonistA could n't just sit and wait for them to catch up to ProtagonistA . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that there were thousands of them . They were all different shades of grey , with the occasional pink or white one mixed in . ProtagonistA did n't know what they were , but ProtagonistA knew they were coming for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA rode right into the middle of them and stopped . ProtagonistA got off ProtagonistA's horse and faced them . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do something . Suddenly , the ground started shaking and the sky turned pink and white . ProtagonistA knew what was happening . ProtagonistA had seen it before . ProtagonistA had seen it in ProtagonistA's dreams . ProtagonistA was being pulled into the dream world . 
Me too , ProtagonistB , gushed ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's eyes sparkling as ProtagonistA turned the thick chain of grass around ProtagonistA to the side . ProtagonistA never thought ProtagonistA 'd find another one like ProtagonistB , but here ProtagonistB is ! Can you believe it ? 
ProtagonistA was a simple man . ProtagonistA worked hard all ProtagonistA's life , first as a farmhand and then as a blacksmith . ProtagonistA never married and had no children , but ProtagonistA was content . ProtagonistA was a good man , and everyone in the village knew it . One day , ProtagonistB came to the village . ProtagonistB was beautiful and kind , and ProtagonistB spoke to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB wanted ProtagonistA to be ProtagonistB's king . ProtagonistA was shocked , but ProtagonistA could n't refuse . ProtagonistA was crowned king , and ProtagonistA ruled for many years . ProtagonistA was a good king , and the people loved ProtagonistA . But one day , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was getting old . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could n't rule forever , and ProtagonistA wanted to make sure that the people would be taken care of after ProtagonistA was gone . So ProtagonistA decreed that , from that day forward , any mare in a free state would have the right to vote and to be elected . It was a radical idea , but ProtagonistA knew that it was the right thing to do . ProtagonistA wanted to make sure that everyone had a say in their own future . 
ProtagonistA sat up , leaned forward to see the sky and ProtagonistA's Pony Ghost hovering just out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye . ProtagonistA had been riding for days , ever since ProtagonistA had seen the Pony Ghost in ProtagonistA's dreams . The Pony Ghost had told ProtagonistA to find the lost city of gold and save the princess . ProtagonistA was getting tired , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep going . ProtagonistA had to find the city and save the princess . 
On the night of the murder , ProtagonistA was killed as ProtagonistA walked to the parlor of the Reynolds ' house to fetch a glass of water . ProtagonistA was stabbed repeatedly with a kitchen knife and ProtagonistA's body was left in a pool of blood . The murder weapon was never found . 
ProtagonistA sat down on the grass , ProtagonistA's hooves lightly tapping the dirt . ProtagonistA was a horse , and ProtagonistA loved the feel of the grass beneath ProtagonistA . It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was enjoying the sunshine . ProtagonistA had a good life , and ProtagonistA was grateful for it . 
ProtagonistA dreamed that ProtagonistA was walking through a dense forest . The trees were so tall that they blocked out the sky . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance . It sounded like someone was crying . ProtagonistA followed the noise until ProtagonistA came to a clearing . In the clearing was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was sitting on the ground , crying . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB was lost . ProtagonistB had been walking in the forest for days and could n't find ProtagonistB's way out . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB not to worry , ProtagonistA would help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's way out of the Forest . Together , they started walking . After a while , they came to the edge of the forest . ProtagonistB was so happy to be out of the Forest . ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help and went on ProtagonistB's way . 
ProtagonistB always told ProtagonistA that the sky was the limit . No matter what ProtagonistA wanted to do in life , ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistA could achieve it if ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to it . And so , from a young age , ProtagonistA began looking up at the sky and dreaming of all the things ProtagonistA could do . As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA continued to look up at the sky , but ProtagonistA also began to notice all the things that were happening on the ground around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA saw the struggles of ProtagonistA's friends and neighbors and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA wanted to help them . So , ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's sights on becoming a doctor . ProtagonistA studied hard and worked even harder , and eventually ProtagonistA achieved ProtagonistA's goal . And , throughout ProtagonistA's career , ProtagonistA never forgot what ProtagonistB had told ProtagonistA : that the sky was the limit . 
ProtagonistA stroked ProtagonistA's lower lip and watched , ProtagonistA's eyes darting across the sky , ProtagonistA's eyes trained on the alicorn . ProtagonistA had never seen one up close before , and ProtagonistA was mesmerized by its beauty . It was like nothing ProtagonistA had ever seen before . ProtagonistA watched as it flew across the sky , its wings outstretched , catching the wind . It was a sight to behold . 
ProtagonistA sat on the ground , ProtagonistA's eyes closed and ProtagonistA's wings flapping free . ProtagonistA was tired from flying all day , but ProtagonistA loved the feeling of the wind in ProtagonistA's feathers . ProtagonistA sat there for a while , just enjoying the peace and quiet , until ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes . ProtagonistA's eyes flew open and ProtagonistA jumped to ProtagonistA's feet , ready to take off at a moment 's notice . But when ProtagonistA saw what was coming towards ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA relaxed and sat back down . It was just a little bird , looking for a place to rest . ProtagonistA watched as the bird hopped around , looking for a spot to settle down . After a few minutes , the bird found a spot next to ProtagonistA and settled down . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes again and went back to enjoying the peace and quiet . 
Some time before the disaster that afflicted the city of Traver , under the watchful eye of the wizard of ProtagonistD , ProtagonistA , stood before the Great CENTIME , and told the tale of ProtagonistB , by the spirited chaperone of ProtagonistC .

ProtagonistB had been kicked out of ProtagonistB's home by ProtagonistB's stepfather , and ProtagonistB had nowhere to go . ProtagonistB was cold and hungry , and ProtagonistB had given up hope of ever finding a place to stay . Suddenly , ProtagonistB saw a light in a window , and ProtagonistB heard a voice calling to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB went to the window and saw ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistC assured ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB would be safe . ProtagonistB went inside , and ProtagonistC introduced ProtagonistC as Lady Elizabeth . ProtagonistC told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistC was a wizard , and that ProtagonistC could help ProtagonistB . ProtagonistC gave ProtagonistB a warm meal and a place to sleep , and ProtagonistC promised to help ProtagonistB find a new home . The next day , ProtagonistC took ProtagonistB to the wizard of ProtagonistD , who agreed to take ProtagonistB in and train ProtagonistB as a wizard .

ProtagonistA will never forget ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistA will always be grateful to ProtagonistC for ProtagonistC's help .  
ProtagonistA wakes up on the morning of the day Twilight never gives a flying fuck about what kingdom ProtagonistA's ancestors ruled . ProtagonistA yawns and stretches and climbs out of bed . ProtagonistA goes to the window and opens the curtains , letting the sunlight stream in . ProtagonistA takes a deep breath and feels the cool air fill ProtagonistA's lungs . ProtagonistA looks out at the world and feels a sense of peace . ProtagonistA turns and walks to ProtagonistA's closet , picking out a pair of jeans and a t - shirt .

Rose looked out over the plain , but on the sound of a distant voice ProtagonistA knew exactly where ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA was in the middle of nowhere , and the voice was coming from ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA started to walk towards the voice , and as ProtagonistA got closer ProtagonistA could see that it was a woman . ProtagonistB was standing on a small hill , and ProtagonistB was looking right at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA started to run , and as ProtagonistA got closer ProtagonistA could see the fear in ProtagonistB's eyes .

ProtagonistA was making no secret of the fact that ProtagonistA was in a state of great agitation when ProtagonistA gave vent to the fullest extent of ProtagonistA's personal irritability to the reader in the related and somewhat trite narrative of the discovery of the Hare of the Woods . It was early morning , and the sun had not yet risen above the horizon , when ProtagonistA came across the hare . The hare was crouched down in the long grass , and it was clear that it was in a state of great agitation . ProtagonistA could see the fear in its eyes , and ProtagonistA knew that it was about to bolt . ProtagonistA was just about to take a step forward when the hare suddenly leapt up and ran away as fast as it could . ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA just stood there for a few moments , before ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had just witnessed the most amazing thing . 
ProtagonistA was standing on the street with ProtagonistA's back to the house , looking up at the huge dark building which , between ProtagonistA's legs , was partially illuminated by the darkness of the night . ProtagonistA was thinking about the day when ProtagonistA would finally be able to move out of this house and into ProtagonistA's own place .

When ProtagonistA's friends found ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was covered in mud and muck from the swamp below . They were all very amused by ProtagonistA's predicament and laughed at ProtagonistA .

ProtagonistA felt so tired ProtagonistA could n't even tell the day . All ProtagonistA knew was that it was either night or early morning , and ProtagonistA had been walking for what felt like forever . ProtagonistA's feet were blistered and sore , ProtagonistA's throat was dry and scratchy , and ProtagonistA's head was pounding . ProtagonistA had been walking for days , ever since ProtagonistA had been kicked out of ProtagonistA's home . ProtagonistA had nowhere to go and no one to turn to .

ProtagonistA could n't give up . ProtagonistA had to find a way to make it through this . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance . It sounded like someone was crying . ProtagonistA followed the sound until ProtagonistA came to a clearing . In the clearing was ProtagonistB , crying ProtagonistB's eyes out . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA did n't want to scare ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA needed help .

ProtagonistA may not have known where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's way home .

The cat meowed and rubbed against the window , wanting to be let in . ProtagonistA was in no mood for dealing with a cat , so ProtagonistA shooed it away . The cat hissed and ran off . A few minutes later , ProtagonistA heard a loud screeching noise coming from ProtagonistA's backyard . ProtagonistA went to investigate and saw the cat attacking ProtagonistA's bird feeder .

ProtagonistA now lives in a palace made of sand and stone in the middle of the desert . ProtagonistA has many servants and a harem of wives , but ProtagonistA is not happy . ProtagonistA misses ProtagonistA's old life and wishes ProtagonistA could be a princess again . 
ProtagonistA looked around at the other ponies on the grounds and , after a few moments ' thought , decided that ProtagonistA preferred the company of the solid , rather than anything that flopped like the usual soft little things that other ponies had . ProtagonistA trotted over to ProtagonistB and nuzzled ProtagonistB's neck . ProtagonistB nickered in response and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart fill with warmth . From then on , ProtagonistA decided , ProtagonistA would only associate with the ponies who were like ProtagonistA : strong , dependable , and solid . 
ProtagonistB was a very weird little pony , very little -- but through no fault of ProtagonistA's own did ProtagonistA ever know it . One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the fields near ProtagonistA's house when ProtagonistA came across a ponytail lying in the grass . ProtagonistA picked it up and brushed it off , and when ProtagonistA did , the ponytail turned into ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was so small that ProtagonistB could barely stand , and ProtagonistB had a very strange look on ProtagonistB's face . ProtagonistA did n't know what to make of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA decided to take ProtagonistB home and care for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB Ponytail and soon they became the best of friends . ProtagonistB was always happy and playful , but ProtagonistA could tell that there was something different about ProtagonistB . One day , ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong , and ProtagonistB replied ,  ProtagonistB 'm just a little weird , that 's all .  
ProtagonistA was about to go to bed when ProtagonistA saw the moon was about to rise . ProtagonistA decided to go for a walk and watch the last of the sun set . ProtagonistA could see over the sea of clouds , and ProtagonistA's golden beams were dancing in the wind . ProtagonistA felt so peaceful and happy watching the sunset . 
ProtagonistA had a feeling something was going to be wrong as soon as ProtagonistA woke up . ProtagonistA could sense it in the way the light was filtering in through the window , in the way the birds were singing . ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to the window , looking out at the day . It was going to be a beautiful day , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to have a problem . ProtagonistA could feel it in ProtagonistA's bones . ProtagonistA sighed and went to get dressed , preparing for whatever was going to come ProtagonistA's way . 
ProtagonistA rolled over in a heap of snow that fell around ProtagonistA like a sea of gold in the middle of the night . ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had seen the light of the fire in the distance . Now , ProtagonistA was so cold and so tired , ProtagonistA could barely move . But ProtagonistA had to keep going . ProtagonistA had to find help . ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was or how ProtagonistA had gotten there . The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was being in ProtagonistA's car , driving home from work . Then , ProtagonistA had hit a patch of ice and lost control of the car . ProtagonistA must have hit ProtagonistA's head , because the next thing ProtagonistA knew , ProtagonistA was waking up in the snow . ProtagonistA had tried to stand up , but ProtagonistA's legs were so weak and ProtagonistA was so disoriented , ProtagonistA could barely stay on ProtagonistA's feet . So ProtagonistA had started crawling , using ProtagonistA's hands to pull ProtagonistA forward through the snow . ProtagonistA had no idea how long ProtagonistA had been crawling , but it felt like forever . Finally , ProtagonistA saw the light of the fire again . It was getting closer . ProtagonistA forced ProtagonistA to keep going , even though every part of ProtagonistA's body was screaming at ProtagonistA to stop . ProtagonistA could n't stop . Not until ProtagonistA reached the fire . ProtagonistA finally made it to the fire and collapsed into it , letting the heat seep into ProtagonistA's frozen body . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was safe now . Help would find ProtagonistA soon . 
The thin smile of ProtagonistA swept across ProtagonistA's gorgeous features as ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB across the room . ProtagonistB was a beautiful woman , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be the perfect addition to ProtagonistA's collection . ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way across the room , never taking ProtagonistA's eyes off of ProtagonistB . When ProtagonistA was finally close enough , ProtagonistA struck up a conversation . ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was interested in ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would have ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was smooth , and ProtagonistB was putty in ProtagonistA's hands . Before long , they were making their way back to ProtagonistA's place .

ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistB in an instant , and ProtagonistB did n't stand a chance . ProtagonistB was just another conquest to add to ProtagonistA's collection . 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's element . ProtagonistA loved dressing up in outrageous outfits and this one was no exception . ProtagonistA felt like a million bucks in ProtagonistA's yellow cardigan with a striped T - shirt underneath , a length of dress - length red - blouse and a blouse with a slit at the knee that fell just below the hips , on which ProtagonistA had a pair of high heels . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA looked good and ProtagonistA was ready to take on the world . ProtagonistA strutted ProtagonistA's stuff down the street , turning heads as ProtagonistA went . ProtagonistA loved the attention ProtagonistA was getting and ProtagonistA was loving every minute of it . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could do anything in this outfit . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could take on the world . ProtagonistA was on top of the world . until ProtagonistA slipped on a banana peel and fell flat on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA lay there for a moment , feeling embarrassed and foolish . ProtagonistA wanted to get up and continue on ProtagonistA's way but ProtagonistA's pride was bruised . ProtagonistA decided to lay there for a while longer and think about what had just happened . ProtagonistA eventually got up , dusted ProtagonistA off and continued on ProtagonistA's way . ProtagonistA was a little bit more careful from then on but ProtagonistA still felt like a million bucks . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA looked good and ProtagonistA was n't going to let a little fall stop ProtagonistA from strutting ProtagonistA's stuff .

ProtagonistA had been staring at ProtagonistA's computer screen for hours , ProtagonistA's eyes dry and strained . ProtagonistA was trying to focus on ProtagonistA's work , but ProtagonistA's mind kept wandering . ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's family and how ProtagonistA had n't seen them in a while . ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's friends and how ProtagonistA had n't talked to them in a while . ProtagonistA thought about the sky and how ProtagonistA had n't seen it in a while . ProtagonistA got up from ProtagonistA's desk and stretched ProtagonistA's arms . ProtagonistA walked to the window and looked outside . The sky was a deep blue , the sun was shining , and the clouds were fluffy and white . ProtagonistA felt a sudden urge to be outside . ProtagonistA grabbed ProtagonistA's jacket and headed for the door . ProtagonistA walked outside and took a deep breath of fresh air . ProtagonistA looked up at the sky and felt a sense of peace . ProtagonistA had been so caught up in ProtagonistA's work that ProtagonistA had forgotten to appreciate the simple things in life . ProtagonistA decided to take a walk . ProtagonistA walked through the park and felt the grass and the sun on ProtagonistA's skin . ProtagonistA felt alive . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had finally seen the sky again . 
ProtagonistA sat down on the edge of the brazier and looked out over the great plain of Pamlicone . ProtagonistA could see the huge forest that stretched before ProtagonistA , and the many small villages that were scattered about it . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would have to cross the plain and the forest to get to ProtagonistA's destination , and ProtagonistA was not looking forward to it . 
ProtagonistA was a loyal dog who always stuck by ProtagonistB's side . One day , ProtagonistB was in a car accident and was taken to the hospital . ProtagonistA barked and hung ProtagonistA's head in worry . ProtagonistA paced back and forth in front of the hospital , waiting for ProtagonistB to come out . Finally , after what felt like forever , ProtagonistB walked out of the hospital with a big smile on ProtagonistB's face . ProtagonistA was so happy to see ProtagonistB and wagged ProtagonistA's tail in excitement . 
ProtagonistA was a detective working in the north of England and ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA 'd never seen anything like it . ProtagonistB was found in a ditch , half - naked and covered in blood . ProtagonistB was a young woman , no more than twenty years old . ProtagonistB's hair was matted with blood and ProtagonistB's eyes were wide open , staring into the cold , dark night . ProtagonistA had seen a lot of things in ProtagonistA's career , but this was something different . There was something about this case that ProtagonistA just could n't shake . The police investigation turned up very little . There were no witnesses and no one had seen anything . ProtagonistA worked tirelessly , but ProtagonistA just could n't crack the case . The only thing they had to go on was the fact that ProtagonistB's body had been found near a small town in the middle of nowhere . Then , one day , ProtagonistA got a call from ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was scared and did n't want to give ProtagonistC's name , but ProtagonistC said ProtagonistC 'd seen something the night ProtagonistB was killed . ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA where to find ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA went to meet ProtagonistC . When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistC shaking and crying . ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC 'd seen ProtagonistD dragging ProtagonistB into the woods . ProtagonistC was too scared to do anything at the time , but ProtagonistC 'd remembered ProtagonistD's face . ProtagonistC described ProtagonistD to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew immediately who ProtagonistD was . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistC for ProtagonistC's help and then ProtagonistA went to arrest ProtagonistD . It was a difficult case , but in the end , justice was served . 
ProtagonistA was having a tough day at work . ProtagonistA had been staring at the same stack of paperwork for hours , and ProtagonistA's eyes were starting to hurt . ProtagonistA decided to take a break and closed ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA stretched out ProtagonistA's fingers and let ProtagonistA's mind wander . ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had been so beautiful , and ProtagonistA had been so taken aback by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could just forget about work and go for a ride on ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA had a hobby , one that ProtagonistA thought was amusing . ProtagonistA liked to sit in ProtagonistA's chair and watch the world go by . ProtagonistA would sit for hours , people watching and making up stories about the lives they must lead . ProtagonistA was content to while away the hours this way and never grew tired of it . 
So , what 's the plan on the diamond market ? ProtagonistA asked as ProtagonistA gazed out at the street . ProtagonistB 'm not sure , ProtagonistB need to do some more research , ProtagonistB replied . ProtagonistB think we should wait and see how the market fluctuates over the next few weeks before making any decisions . 
ProtagonistA had been thinking about the other day , when ProtagonistA 'd finally realized that ProtagonistA was not what ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA 'd always thought ProtagonistA was a good person , a kind person . But then ProtagonistA 'd done something , something that ProtagonistA knew was wrong , and ProtagonistA 'd realized that ProtagonistA was capable of darkness . ProtagonistA was n't sure what to do with this new knowledge , but it weighed on ProtagonistA heavily . 
ProtagonistA jumped off the roof of ProtagonistA's home and swam up to a small stream that ran through a small clearing of the bank . ProtagonistA had never been a very good swimmer , but ProtagonistA was determined to reach the other side . ProtagonistA struggled against the current , but eventually made it to the other side . ProtagonistA lay on the bank , gasping for breath , and looked up at the sky . ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had made it to the other side . 
ProtagonistB had always been a bit of a mystery to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB never talked about ProtagonistB's past , and whenever ProtagonistA asked about ProtagonistB's family , ProtagonistB would always change the subject . So , when ProtagonistB announced one day that they were going to visit the Apple family , ProtagonistA was intrigued . The Apple family home was a large , imposing mansion . ProtagonistB was greeted warmly by the family , and it was clear that they knew each other well . ProtagonistA was introduced to the family , and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA caught up in their stories and laughter . It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever felt like ProtagonistA belonged somewhere . ProtagonistA was happy to finally have found a family that ProtagonistA could call ProtagonistA's own . 
ProtagonistB had been trying to talk ProtagonistA into taking a trip to ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB had always wanted to see the sights and sounds of ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistB thought it would be a great opportunity for ProtagonistA to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city . ProtagonistA was n't so sure . ProtagonistA had never been a big fan of horses , and ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA would like the idea of spending a week in a town full of them . But ProtagonistB was insistent , and ProtagonistB finally convinced ProtagonistA to give it a try . ProtagonistA arrived in ProtagonistC on a warm summer day . The first thing ProtagonistA noticed was the smell of the fresh air . It was a far cry from the smog and pollution of the city . ProtagonistA also noticed the horses . They were everywhere , and they were all so beautiful . ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA enjoying ProtagonistA's time in ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA went on horseback rides , visited the local shops , and even made some new friends . By the end of the week , ProtagonistA was sorry to be leaving . But ProtagonistA was already planning to come back next year . 
ProtagonistA was a horse who loved to run . ProtagonistA would gallop across the fields , enjoying the wind in ProtagonistA's mane and the sun on ProtagonistA's back . One day , while ProtagonistA was out running , ProtagonistA tripped on a root and fell . ProtagonistA hurt ProtagonistA's hoof and could not get up . ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA lying in the field . ProtagonistB could tell that ProtagonistA was in pain . ProtagonistB held ProtagonistA's hoof flat against the back of the head , and the rest of ProtagonistA's body relaxed into the hovering motion of the completed form . ProtagonistB knew what to do . ProtagonistB gently picked ProtagonistA up and carried ProtagonistA back to the barn . ProtagonistC came and looked at ProtagonistA's hoof . ProtagonistC said that ProtagonistA would need to rest for a while , but ProtagonistA would be okay . ProtagonistA was grateful to ProtagonistB for helping ProtagonistA . From then on , whenever ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would whinny and nicker in thanks . 
ProtagonistA awoke to find ProtagonistA in a strange land . ProtagonistA could not remember how ProtagonistA got there , or even where ProtagonistA was . The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was going to bed the night before . ProtagonistA looked around , trying to get ProtagonistA's bearings , but everything was unfamiliar to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA saw a faint path leading off into the distance and decided to follow it . As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA began to remember bits and pieces of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA remembered ProtagonistA's wife and children , and how much ProtagonistA loved them . ProtagonistA also remembered the day ProtagonistA died . ProtagonistA remembered feeling peace and calm as ProtagonistA passed from this life to the next . As the memories came back to ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA also began to feel a sense of purpose . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was meant to follow this path . ProtagonistA did not know where it would lead ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA had faith that it would all work out in the end . ProtagonistA continued walking until ProtagonistA came to a large door . ProtagonistA knew this was ProtagonistA's destination . ProtagonistA opened the door and walked through . On the other side was a beautiful garden . ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistA's loved ones waiting for ProtagonistA . They were all smiling and happy . ProtagonistA felt at peace as ProtagonistA walked towards them . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had finally come home . 
ProtagonistA was in the sky and looked like a jewel when ProtagonistA rose , but I never did see ProtagonistA bigger than a ball , and it was n't until I was seventeen that I realized I was bigger than ProtagonistA . I was out on a date with ProtagonistB at the time , and we were lying on a blanket in the park , looking up at the stars . I pointed out ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB just laughed and said ,  You 're bigger than ProtagonistA , silly .  I was so embarrassed , but I realized ProtagonistB was right . I was bigger than ProtagonistA . I had never thought about it before , but I was bigger than the moon and the stars . I was bigger than the universe . And it was a beautiful feeling . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked at a blank horizon . ProtagonistA was a dog , and a good dog at that , but ProtagonistA did n't know what to make of the blank horizon . ProtagonistA had been sitting there for hours , ever since ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistA behind . ProtagonistA was n't sure why ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB must have had a good reason . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did n't want to leave the blank horizon . ProtagonistA was waiting for something , ProtagonistA did n't know what , but ProtagonistA knew that whatever it was , it was coming for ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistB's footing at the edge of a ruined stream , and was struggling to ProtagonistA's feet . The water was up to ProtagonistA's waist , and the current was strong . ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB downstream , clinging to a tree . ProtagonistA shouted to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB could n't hear ProtagonistA over the sound of the water . ProtagonistA tried to swim to ProtagonistB , but the current was too strong . ProtagonistA was pulled under the water and swept away . 
ProtagonistA's name was Marilyn , but I do not know ProtagonistA or care for ProtagonistA . I never really liked ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's boyfriend so I had to be nice to ProtagonistA . I never understood what ProtagonistB saw in ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB was head over heels in love with ProtagonistA . I remember one time , ProtagonistB came to me crying because ProtagonistA had cheated on ProtagonistB . I comforted ProtagonistB and told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB deserved better . I was so happy when ProtagonistB finally dumped ProtagonistA . I never had to pretend to be friends with ProtagonistA again . 
ProtagonistA thundered down the hall of the Palace , ProtagonistA's hooves pounding against the stone walls . ProtagonistA was on a mission . ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had to save ProtagonistB from the dragon . ProtagonistA had to be the hero . ProtagonistA turned a corner and saw the dragon , its teeth bared , its eyes glowing red . ProtagonistA did n't hesitate . ProtagonistA charged . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches , staring up at the stars . ProtagonistA was lost in thought , wondering if there was anyone else out there in the vast universe . Suddenly , a shooting star streaked across the sky , and ProtagonistA made a wish . ProtagonistA wished that ProtagonistA could find someone to share ProtagonistA's life with . Someone who would understand ProtagonistA and love ProtagonistA for who ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA continued to stare at the stars , lost in thought . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistB standing there . ProtagonistB was staring at ProtagonistA with the same look of wonder and curiosity . ProtagonistA felt as if ProtagonistA had been struck by lightning . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was the woman ProtagonistA had been waiting for ProtagonistA's whole life . ProtagonistA stood up and walked over to ProtagonistB , and they embraced each other . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's wish had come true . 
ProtagonistA had had a long day . ProtagonistA was exhausted from all the work ProtagonistA had to do to keep ProtagonistA's kingdom running smoothly . All ProtagonistA wanted to do was relax in ProtagonistA's palace by the sea . ProtagonistA lit a match and put it between the curtains and the headboard , and watched as the flames spread . Soon , the entire room was engulfed in flames . ProtagonistA just sat there and watched as ProtagonistA's palace burned to the ground . ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistA was now homeless and penniless . All ProtagonistA cared about was that ProtagonistA was finally free from all ProtagonistA's responsibilities . ProtagonistA could finally relax and enjoy ProtagonistA's life . 
ProtagonistA used to love going into the sunflower garden when ProtagonistA was younger . ProtagonistA would duck in every chance ProtagonistA got , even if ProtagonistA was just supposed to be getting the mail . ProtagonistA loved the smell of the sunflowers and the way they made ProtagonistA feel happy . One day , when ProtagonistA was older , ProtagonistA went back to the sunflower garden . ProtagonistA was surprised to see that the sunflowers were all gone . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what had happened and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the sunflowers had been replaced with roses . ProtagonistA was sad to see the sunflowers go , but ProtagonistA was happy to see the roses . 
ProtagonistA had been waiting all morning for the important piece of paperwork that was going to give ProtagonistB ProtagonistB's retroactive pardon . ProtagonistA had been waiting for weeks , ever since ProtagonistB had been arrested for a crime ProtagonistB did n't commit . Finally , the day had arrived . The piece of paper arrived in the mail , and ProtagonistA rushed to ProtagonistB's cell to give it to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was overjoyed , and they embraced each other through the bars .

ProtagonistA was working on the front porch , putting the finishing touches on it . ProtagonistA was putting in a new railing and making sure that it was level . ProtagonistB was helping ProtagonistA and they were both sweating in the cold December air . They were almost done when they heard a noise . It sounded like someone was crying . They both turned around and saw ProtagonistC standing at the edge of the property . ProtagonistC was crying and ProtagonistC looked lost . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB both went over to ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistC if ProtagonistC was okay and ProtagonistC said that ProtagonistC was lost . ProtagonistC said that ProtagonistC was looking for ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD had run away from home a few weeks ago and ProtagonistC had been looking for ProtagonistD ever since .

Everyone loved it , and ProtagonistA was congratulated on a job well done . ProtagonistA was thrilled , and ProtagonistA knew that this dish would be remembered for years to come . 
ProtagonistA turned around on ProtagonistA's heels and ran to ProtagonistA's bed , the one ProtagonistA's father had made for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB , to begin the long process of mourning . It would be a long and difficult journey , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do it . ProtagonistA owed it to ProtagonistA's father , and to ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA had been a horse for as long as ProtagonistA could remember . ProtagonistA had been born into a life of servitude and had never known anything else . ProtagonistA was used to the hard work and the long hours , but lately , something had been different . ProtagonistA could feel a restlessness inside of ProtagonistA , a desire for something more . As ProtagonistA stood in ProtagonistA's stall , ProtagonistA's eyes filled with tears as ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was tired of being a horse , tired of being treated like a piece of property . ProtagonistA wanted to be free , to live ProtagonistA's life the way ProtagonistA wanted to . ProtagonistA's thoughts turned to revenge as ProtagonistA thought about the humans who had treated ProtagonistA so poorly . ProtagonistA wanted to make them pay for all the years of pain and suffering they had caused ProtagonistA . But then ProtagonistA thought about escape .

ProtagonistA was tired of being a horse , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to escape ProtagonistA's life of servitude . 
ProtagonistA had never been a particularly good father . ProtagonistA was always too wrapped up in ProtagonistA's own life to really pay attention to ProtagonistB , and when ProtagonistB was younger , ProtagonistA would often forget to pick ProtagonistB up from school or take ProtagonistB to ProtagonistB's soccer games . As ProtagonistB got older , ProtagonistB stopped asking ProtagonistA to do things with ProtagonistB , and they gradually grew apart . But one morning , when the sun was bright and the mergansie were jovial , ProtagonistA decided to see ProtagonistB for the first time in years .

ProtagonistD gave ProtagonistA a place to stay and helped ProtagonistA get a job . ProtagonistA was finally starting to turn ProtagonistA's life around . ProtagonistA was happy and ProtagonistA had a future . However , ProtagonistA's past was always haunting ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always afraid that ProtagonistA would end up back on the streets . ProtagonistA was always afraid that ProtagonistA would end up like ProtagonistC . But ProtagonistA was determined to make something of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was determined to succeed . And ProtagonistA did . 
ProtagonistA was just finishing up the last of the cupcakes and had nearly finished ProtagonistA's breakfast when ProtagonistA heard the door open . ProtagonistA knew it was ProtagonistB coming home from ProtagonistB's night shift at the hospital . ProtagonistA got up to greet ProtagonistB with a hug and a kiss .  Hey , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB missed ProtagonistA .  
ProtagonistA had been trying to find ProtagonistA's way out of the living room for hours . ProtagonistA had been looking for the door for what felt like days , but ProtagonistA could n't find it . The room was a maze and ProtagonistA was getting tired . ProtagonistA had been walking for hours and ProtagonistA's feet were sore . ProtagonistA sat down to rest for a minute and looked around the room . ProtagonistA saw the door across the room and got up to walk to it . ProtagonistA was so tired , ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA might not make it . ProtagonistA took a few steps and then ProtagonistA saw something that made ProtagonistA stop . There was a hole in the door and ProtagonistA could see the other side . ProtagonistA walked to the door and looked through the hole . ProtagonistA saw the living room and the door to the outside . ProtagonistA was so happy , ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's way out . 
It was the summer day in 1833 that ProtagonistA , was walking ProtagonistB , down the road , and considering in ProtagonistA's mind whether ProtagonistA should continue to be a single mother , or if ProtagonistA should go back to the family home , and , indeed , if ProtagonistA should , to marry a woman . ProtagonistA had not been married for many years , and ProtagonistB was now grown and married ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistA's own wife , who had died when ProtagonistB was only a child . ProtagonistA had never remarried , and had instead devoted ProtagonistA to raising ProtagonistB . Now that ProtagonistB was married , ProtagonistA felt somewhat lost . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could not continue to live alone , and so ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA would go back to the family home and marry a woman . 
The day the earth froze , ProtagonistA used the last of ProtagonistA's magic power to reveal to ProtagonistB the greatest secret of all .  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB 've always wondered why ProtagonistA 'm so different from ProtagonistB . The truth is , ProtagonistA 'm not entirely human . ProtagonistA 'm actually a magical being from another world . ProtagonistA was sent here to help make ProtagonistB's life better , and ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA 've done a pretty good job . But now , ProtagonistA's magic is gone and ProtagonistA have to go back to ProtagonistA's own world . ProtagonistA 'm sorry ProtagonistA could n't tell ProtagonistB sooner , but ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB 'll be just fine without ProtagonistA .  With that , ProtagonistA vanished into thin air , leaving ProtagonistB to wonder what had just happened . 
 That recipe 's on ProtagonistC ,  said ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB , sitting down in a seat at the end of the court .  ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB to get it for ProtagonistA . What recipe ?  ProtagonistB asked . The one for the perfect crime ,  ProtagonistA replied .  ProtagonistA need to get ProtagonistA's hands on it so ProtagonistA can finally get away with murder . ProtagonistB was taken aback by the request .  ProtagonistB 'm not sure ProtagonistB can do that ,  ProtagonistB said . You have to ,  ProtagonistA insisted .  ProtagonistA 'm going to kill ProtagonistA's wife and ProtagonistA need to make sure ProtagonistA do n't get caught . The recipe is on ProtagonistC's computer and ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB to hack into it and get it for ProtagonistA . The lawyer was hesitant , but ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB could n't just let ProtagonistA commit murder . ProtagonistB agreed to try and get the recipe for the perfect crime . A few days later , ProtagonistB was able to hack into ProtagonistC's computer and get the recipe . ProtagonistB gave it to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was never caught and the recipe was never found . 
ProtagonistA looked around and noticed that ProtagonistA had disappeared . ProtagonistA did n't know how it had happened , but ProtagonistA was now in a strange place . There were no people or animals , just a vast emptiness . ProtagonistA started to walk , hoping to find a way out . After a while , ProtagonistA came to a huge door . ProtagonistA tried to open it , but it was locked . ProtagonistA kept walking and came to another door . This one was also locked . ProtagonistA kept walking and came to a third door . This one was not locked . ProtagonistA opened it and walked through . ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden . There were flowers of all colors , and a soft breeze was blowing . ProtagonistA felt at peace in this place . 
ProtagonistA had been walking for days . ProtagonistA's feet were sore , ProtagonistA's throat was dry , and ProtagonistA's stomach was grumbling . ProtagonistA had been hoping to find a town or at least a farmhouse , but so far ProtagonistA had seen nothing but empty plains . ProtagonistA was about to give up and sit down for a rest when ProtagonistA saw something on the horizon . ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA's eyes ! There , in the distance , was a town ! ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace and soon ProtagonistA was standing at the edge of the town . It looked abandoned . ProtagonistA walked through the streets , calling out for any sign of life , but there was none . ProtagonistA sat down on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked at the blank horizon . It was then that ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA was n't alone . 
ProtagonistA's name was Elice and forever after , even now when I regret not having the courage to ask ProtagonistA's name , I will not forget ProtagonistA's dark face when ProtagonistA looked up at me with such wonder and such complete and utter confusion and such a strange and almost sadistic delight in the face of such great disappointment and such a strange and almost sadistic delight in the face of such great fear and such deep and profound fear . I had never seen anything like it before and I doubt I will ever see anything like it again . It was as if ProtagonistA had been expecting something great and wonderful and had been let down so badly that ProtagonistA could n't help but take some kind of sick pleasure in my own fear . 
ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistA's eyes peeled for anything out of the ordinary , but ProtagonistA was doing ProtagonistA best to ignore the odd look the look of interest was giving ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA let ProtagonistA get too caught up in what was going on , ProtagonistA would never be able to focus on ProtagonistA's work . It was important to ProtagonistA to stay focused , no matter what . But the more ProtagonistA tried to ignore the look , the more it seemed to bother ProtagonistA . It was as if the look was boring into ProtagonistA's soul , demanding ProtagonistA's attention . ProtagonistA tried to shake it off , but it was no use . Finally , ProtagonistA gave up and turned to ProtagonistB . Can ProtagonistA help ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked , a little bit of annoyance in ProtagonistA's voice . ProtagonistB , smiled .  ProtagonistB 'm sorry , ProtagonistB did n't mean to stare . It 's just that ProtagonistA look so much like ProtagonistB's brother . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart soften a little .  Oh , ProtagonistA see . ProtagonistA 'm sorry to hear about ProtagonistB's brother . Thank ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  It 's been hard , but ProtagonistB 'm trying to stay positive . With that , ProtagonistB turned and walked away , leaving ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's thoughts . ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistB's story and ProtagonistB's strength in the face of adversity . It reminded ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA , too , had to be strong . No matter what life threw at ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA would keep ProtagonistA's eyes peeled for anything out of the ordinary and stay focused on what was important . 
ProtagonistA trotted across the grass to ProtagonistA's new cottage . ProtagonistA had only moved in a few weeks ago , but ProtagonistA loved it already . It was so cozy and perfect for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA trotted down the steps and to the door , stopping to sniff at a flower that was blooming by the door . ProtagonistA nosed the door open and went inside , immediately going to ProtagonistA's favourite spot by the window . ProtagonistA lay down and watched the birds as they flew by , content in ProtagonistA's new home . 
ProtagonistA had always been an early riser , so it was no surprise to find ProtagonistA up and about at the crack of dawn . However , what was surprising was that ProtagonistA was now standing in the middle of ProtagonistB's bookstore . ProtagonistA looked around the vast space with the air of a man who had been transported back to England . It was clear that ProtagonistA was not used to the sight of so many books . In fact , it appeared as if ProtagonistA had never seen a bookstore before . ProtagonistB , approached ProtagonistA with a quizzical look on ProtagonistB's face .  Can ProtagonistB help ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked . ProtagonistA turned to ProtagonistB and said ,  ProtagonistA 'm looking for a book on etiquette . ProtagonistA 've been told that ProtagonistA need to improve ProtagonistA's manners . ProtagonistB smiled and led ProtagonistA to the section on etiquette . ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA find a few books on the subject and then left ProtagonistA to browse . ProtagonistA was so engrossed in the books that ProtagonistA did n't notice when the store started to fill up with customers . As the day went on , ProtagonistA became more and more comfortable in the bookstore . ProtagonistA started chatting with the customers and helping them find the books they were looking for . By the end of the day , ProtagonistA had made quite a few friends . It was only when ProtagonistA was getting ready to leave that ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had completely forgotten about ProtagonistA's original mission . ProtagonistA had found what ProtagonistA was looking for , not in a book , but in the people ProtagonistA had met . 
ProtagonistA had been going through a bad patch of writing for a few weeks now , but if the last few months had gone by ProtagonistA had not long since come to the realisation that the final word was not always the most important . ProtagonistA had been through some tough times recently , and ProtagonistA's writing had suffered as a result . But ProtagonistA was determined to get back on track , and ProtagonistA knew that the only way to do that was to keep writing . So ProtagonistA sat down at ProtagonistA's desk and started to write . And , to ProtagonistA's surprise , the words came more easily than they had in weeks . ProtagonistA wrote and wrote , and the words flowed from ProtagonistA's pen . ProtagonistA did n't worry about whether they were perfect or not , ProtagonistA just kept writing . And , as ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA started to feel better . The writing was helping ProtagonistA to process what had happened , and to make sense of it all . Slowly but surely , ProtagonistA was starting to heal . 
ProtagonistA stood up and trotted through the gardens , running up the side of a hill and across the grass , until ProtagonistA reached the top of a bluff above the water 's surface . At the edge of the bluff , ProtagonistA stopped and looked down at the water below . It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining down on the water , making it sparkle . ProtagonistA loved the smell of the ocean , and ProtagonistA could see the waves crashing against the shore in the distance . ProtagonistA was about to turn and go back down the hill when ProtagonistA heard a noise behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA turned around and saw a big , black bear coming towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was scared , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should run away , but ProtagonistA was frozen in place . The bear came closer and closer , until it was right in front of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and waited for the bear to attack ProtagonistA . But the attack never came . When ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes , the bear was gone . ProtagonistA did n't know what had happened , but ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA was still alive . ProtagonistA turned and ran back down the hill as fast as ProtagonistA could . 
ProtagonistA had been out all day , running errands and doing errands . ProtagonistA was tired and cold and just wanted to go home , to ProtagonistA's warm and cozy house . But when ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA's house was dark and cold . The only light came from the castle , and the dog that ran in and out of the room was quite a bother . ProtagonistA was so tired and cold that ProtagonistA just wanted to curl up in a ball and go to sleep . But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to find a way to get warm and to light ProtagonistA's house . ProtagonistA went to the castle and asked for help . The king and queen were very kind and gave ProtagonistA a fire and some candles . They also gave ProtagonistA a blanket to keep warm . ProtagonistA was so grateful . ProtagonistA went home and immediately started a fire in the fireplace and lit all the candles . ProtagonistA was so happy to be warm and to have light . ProtagonistA curled up in ProtagonistA's blanket and went to sleep , feeling grateful for the king and queen 's help . 
ProtagonistA stood on ProtagonistA's rock and stared into the water . ProtagonistA had been coming to this spot for years , ever since ProtagonistA was a child . It was ProtagonistA's special place , where ProtagonistA could think and dream . Today , ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how it had turned out . ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a writer , but it had never happened . ProtagonistA had always wanted to travel , but ProtagonistA had never been able to afford it . ProtagonistA had always wanted to be happy , but ProtagonistA had never been able to find true happiness . As ProtagonistA stared into the water , ProtagonistA made a decision . ProtagonistA was going to change ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was going to do the things ProtagonistA had always wanted to do . ProtagonistA was going to be the person ProtagonistA had always wanted to be . 
ProtagonistA was having a hard time deciding whether to take ProtagonistA's first trip home or not . ProtagonistA had been away at college for a year , and while ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's independence , ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's family and friends back home . In the end , ProtagonistA decided to take the trip home . ProtagonistA was so excited to see everyone again and to catch up on all the news . ProtagonistA had a great time , and it was nice to be home again . 
ProtagonistA is my best friend . ProtagonistA does n't remember me being born but ProtagonistA 's right ; I have the best hooves on the staff of Everfree . The best in magic . And ProtagonistA really likes me , but that does n't bother ProtagonistA much anymore . I was born in the early hours of the morning , just as the sun was peeking over the horizon . ProtagonistA was the first to see me , and ProtagonistA welcomed me into the world with a warm hug . You're going to be the best hooves on the staff of Everfree ,  ProtagonistA said .  The best in magic . I believed ProtagonistA , and I still do . ProtagonistA 's never been wrong about anything . ProtagonistA has always been there for me , even when I made mistakes . Like the time I accidentally turned ProtagonistA's favorite hat into a frog . Or when I turned ProtagonistA's favorite book into a pile of mush . ProtagonistA always forgives me , and ProtagonistA always makes me laugh . That 's why ProtagonistA 's my best friend . 
ProtagonistA had been married to Applejack for several weeks when ProtagonistA heard that Twilight was expecting ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was overjoyed for ProtagonistA's friends and could n't wait to meet ProtagonistB . When ProtagonistB was born , ProtagonistA was one of the first to visit and held ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's arms , tears of joy streaming down ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA was so happy to have another little one in the family and could n't wait to watch ProtagonistB grow up . 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day . First , ProtagonistA's alarm clock did n't go off , so ProtagonistA was late for work . Then , ProtagonistA's boss yelled at ProtagonistA for being late . And to top it all off , ProtagonistA accidentally spilled coffee all over ProtagonistA's shirt . ProtagonistA was so frazzled and upset that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . So ProtagonistA just sat down on the ground , on top of ProtagonistA's hooves , with ProtagonistA's tail turned to one side and ProtagonistA's eyes closed . ProtagonistA needed a moment to calm down and gather ProtagonistA's thoughts . But unfortunately , that moment never came . A dog came over and started barking at ProtagonistA , and a cat walked by and knocked ProtagonistA over . ProtagonistA just wanted to be left alone , but it seemed like the whole world was against ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was out on a walk with ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA suddenly had the urge to play a prank on ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA quickly slit the muzzle of ProtagonistB's gun into the air and let out a little whine of  Oops !  around the top of ProtagonistA's throat . ProtagonistB was so startled by the sudden noise that ProtagonistB dropped ProtagonistB's gun and ran off in terror . ProtagonistA laughed to ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB go , before continuing on ProtagonistA's walk . 
ProtagonistA was a pegasus who loved to fly . ProtagonistA loved the feeling of the wind in ProtagonistA's mane and the sun on ProtagonistA's back . But one day , when ProtagonistA was flying over the sea , ProtagonistA saw something strange . There was a large object in the water and it was moving ! ProtagonistA flew closer to get a better look and saw that it was a boat . ProtagonistA had never seen a boat before and was curious about it . ProtagonistA flew down to the water and landed on the boat . ProtagonistA looked around and saw that there were people on the boat . They were all wearing strange clothes and they were speaking a language ProtagonistA had never heard before . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , so ProtagonistA just sat on ProtagonistA's saddle and watched the people . 
ProtagonistA looked up from the book ProtagonistA was reading , and the tear - streaked blue of ProtagonistA's eyes seemed to say , ProtagonistA think we both know what we 're in for . We had been married for six months , and in that time , ProtagonistA had become increasingly distant . ProtagonistA worked long hours and when ProtagonistA was home , ProtagonistA was always either reading or watching television . I had begged ProtagonistA to talk to me , to tell me what was wrong , but ProtagonistA always brushed me off . I was about to give up hope when ProtagonistA finally looked up from ProtagonistA's book and spoke to me . ProtagonistA's eyes were full of sadness and regret .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA know ProtagonistA 've been a terrible husband . ProtagonistA just ... ProtagonistA do n't know how to fix this . We both sat in silence for a moment , contemplating what our next move should be . It was clear that we both loved each other , but something was holding ProtagonistA back . I reached out and took ProtagonistA's hand , and ProtagonistA squeezed it tight . We'll figure this out ,  I said .  Together .  
ProtagonistA's hooves stopped pounding the dirt beside the bank , and ProtagonistA's eyes once more settled on the horizon . ProtagonistA had been running for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had seen the fire in the distance . Now , as ProtagonistA stood on the bank of the river , ProtagonistA could see the flames still burning in the distance . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to cross the river to get to safety , but ProtagonistA was so tired . ProtagonistA had been running for days , ever since the fire had started . ProtagonistA did n't know how much longer ProtagonistA could keep going . ProtagonistA stood there for a moment , trying to summon the energy to cross the river . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving , but ProtagonistA was so tired . Finally , ProtagonistA took a deep breath and stepped into the water . The cold water shocked ProtagonistA's system and ProtagonistA started to swim . ProtagonistA did n't know how long it took ProtagonistA to cross the river , but eventually ProtagonistA made it to the other side . ProtagonistA climbed up on the bank and collapsed . ProtagonistA lay there , trying to catch ProtagonistA's breath , as ProtagonistA watched the flames in the distance . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving , but ProtagonistA was so tired . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and drifted off to sleep . 
The first time we met ProtagonistA , in a dream , ProtagonistA had gone there alone . It was a dark and stormy night , and ProtagonistA had been driving home from work . ProtagonistA's car had broken down , and ProtagonistA had been forced to seek shelter in a nearby house . The house had been abandoned , and ProtagonistA had been exploring it when ProtagonistA 'd suddenly fallen asleep . In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA in a strange place . There was a door in front of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had opened it . ProtagonistA had been met by ProtagonistA . The two Bobs had then shaken hands and gone their separate ways . When ProtagonistA had awoken , ProtagonistA had been alone in the dark house . ProtagonistA had no idea what the dream had meant , but ProtagonistA had been left with a feeling of unease . 
ProtagonistA watched the sunset from the window of ProtagonistA's room at the end of the house , ProtagonistA's fingers pressing the slender small mirror against the tabletop in the middle of the room . The sun was a huge orange ball that was slowly sinking into the horizon , and the sky was a beautiful red and orange . ProtagonistA loved sunsets , and ProtagonistA loved watching them from ProtagonistA's room . ProtagonistA loved the way the colors changed and the way the light shone through the window . It was always so peaceful and calming . ProtagonistA sat in ProtagonistA's chair and watched the sunset until it was gone , and then ProtagonistA went to bed . 
ProtagonistA had never imagined that ProtagonistA would be one of the subject matter of such a search , but even now it seemed that ProtagonistA was holding onto something which perhaps ProtagonistA was n't entirely comfortable with . It had been a few weeks since the incident had occurred , and ProtagonistA still could n't shake the feeling that ProtagonistA was being watched . Everywhere ProtagonistA went , ProtagonistA felt as though eyes were upon ProtagonistA , following ProtagonistA's every move . It was an unsettling feeling , to say the least . The incident itself was n't anything too out of the ordinary . ProtagonistA had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time . ProtagonistA had been walking home from work one evening when ProtagonistA had seen a group of men loitering in an alleyway . Something about their demeanour had made ProtagonistA uneasy , so ProtagonistA had decided to take a different route home . It was only when ProtagonistA had heard shouting and commotion coming from the alleyway that ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA may have made a mistake . ProtagonistA had hesitated for a moment , not knowing whether to intervene or not . But then ProtagonistA had seen one of the men pull out a knife , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do something . ProtagonistA had run into the alleyway and tackled the man with the knife to the ground . It was only then that ProtagonistA had realized that the other men were police officers , and that ProtagonistA had just saved the life of their undercover colleague . In the aftermath of the incident , ProtagonistA had been hailed as a hero . ProtagonistA's face had been splashed all over the newspapers and ProtagonistA had even been given a medal by the police . But ProtagonistA did n't feel like a hero . ProtagonistA just felt like a normal guy who had done what anyone else would have done in that situation . Now , it seemed , ProtagonistA's normal life was over . ProtagonistA was constantly being followed by the media , and ProtagonistA had even had to hire a bodyguard . It was all just too much for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA just wanted to go back to living a normal , anonymous life . But it seemed that was no longer an option for ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was so nervous , ProtagonistA could barely stand still . ProtagonistA had never been away from home before , and the big city was so scary . But ProtagonistB had promised ProtagonistA that everything would be alright . It 's all right , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said so sweetly , that ProtagonistB's hooves shook the paper as ProtagonistB said it .  ProtagonistB said so , and ProtagonistB 's never lied to ProtagonistA before , has he?The filly shook ProtagonistA's head , and ProtagonistB nuzzled ProtagonistA gently . Then trust ProtagonistB , everything will be just fine . And with that , ProtagonistA found the courage to step out into the unknown . 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's room , looking at the stars and thinking about ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was a tall , thin man who was born in England but had lived in America for most of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was thinking about how little ProtagonistA had left to ProtagonistA's name and how ProtagonistA's daughter , Dora , would be left with even less . ProtagonistA was bored with this thought and decided to go to bed . 
One morning ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's doubts again . ProtagonistA was walking to work , and ProtagonistA just could n't shake the feeling that something was off . ProtagonistA could n't put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but ProtagonistA just had this feeling like something bad was going to happen . ProtagonistA tried to push it out of ProtagonistA's mind , but it was just nagging at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistB calling ProtagonistA's name until ProtagonistA was right in front of ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA okay ? ProtagonistA looked a million miles away .  ProtagonistA snapped out of it and forced a smile .  Yeah , ProtagonistA 'm fine . Just got a lot on ProtagonistA's mind .  ProtagonistB nodded understandingly .  Well , try to leave it at the door . We 've got a lot to do today .  ProtagonistA nodded and went to ProtagonistA's desk . ProtagonistA tried to focus on ProtagonistA's work , but ProtagonistA's mind was still racing . ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistB calling ProtagonistA's name until ProtagonistB was right in front of ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA okay ? ProtagonistA looked a million miles away .  ProtagonistA snapped out of it and forced a smile .  Yeah , ProtagonistA 'm fine .

ProtagonistA nodded and went to ProtagonistA's desk . ProtagonistA tried to focus on ProtagonistA's work , but ProtagonistA's mind was still racing . 
ProtagonistA was back at the bank , shuffling ProtagonistA's feet as ProtagonistA waited with bated breath for the check to come in . ProtagonistA had been waiting for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had been laid off from ProtagonistA's job . The check was ProtagonistA's last hope ; if it did n't come in , ProtagonistA would be homeless . Finally , the check arrived . ProtagonistA's heart sank as ProtagonistA saw the amount ; it was far less than ProtagonistA had been expecting . There was no way it would be enough to cover ProtagonistA's rent . ProtagonistA was desperate . ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB and begged for a loan , but ProtagonistB refused . ProtagonistA had no collateral and no way to prove ProtagonistA could repay the loan . ProtagonistA was out of options . ProtagonistA went home and packed ProtagonistA's belongings into a suitcase . ProtagonistA would have to find a way to make the check stretch until ProtagonistA could find another job . 
ProtagonistA looked around , minding ProtagonistA's own business , when ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA face to face with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was looking for a fight , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was n't going to back down . They stared each other down for what felt like an eternity , until finally ProtagonistB made ProtagonistB's move . ProtagonistB charged straight for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was ready . ProtagonistA dodged to the side at the last second , leaving ProtagonistB to slam into a tree . ProtagonistB was momentarily stunned , and ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's opportunity . ProtagonistA ran up to ProtagonistB and punched ProtagonistB in the face as hard as ProtagonistA could . ProtagonistB went down , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had won . 
ProtagonistA lifted ProtagonistA's head , and peered out over the horizon . ProtagonistA had been walking for days , and was getting tired . ProtagonistA had been hoping to find a town soon , but so far ProtagonistA had seen nothing but desert . ProtagonistA was about to give up and sit down for a rest , when ProtagonistA saw something in the distance . ProtagonistA started walking towards it , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was a town . ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , and soon ProtagonistA was in the town . ProtagonistA went to the first building ProtagonistA saw , and knocked on the door . ProtagonistB answered , and when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB screamed . 
ProtagonistA has been slowly moping ProtagonistA's hooves through the blizzard of paperwork that is the letter from the Apple family . ProtagonistA 's been at it for hours , and ProtagonistA 's only halfway through . ProtagonistA's eyes are starting to glaze over , and ProtagonistA's head is starting to ache . ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA wo n't be able to finish it tonight , but ProtagonistA ca n't just leave it unfinished . ProtagonistA 'll have to come back tomorrow and try again . 
ProtagonistA sat by ProtagonistA's friends , watching them , and looking around ProtagonistA saw that they were all having a great time . ProtagonistA felt a little left out , but ProtagonistA did n't want to ruin their fun . ProtagonistA decided to just enjoy watching them and listening to their laughter . 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's bedroom , writing a letter to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was telling ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's day and how ProtagonistA had made a new friend . ProtagonistA was really happy and ProtagonistA wanted to share it with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was also telling ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's plans for the future and how ProtagonistA wanted to make a difference in the world . ProtagonistA was really excited about life and ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistB to know it . 
ProtagonistA thrashed about on all fours , helping ProtagonistA's hooves through the dusty soil like a frightened child . ProtagonistA had never felt so scared in ProtagonistA's life . The noise of the thunder and the lightning was so loud that ProtagonistA could barely hear ProtagonistA think . ProtagonistA was sure that any moment now , the ground would open up and swallow ProtagonistA whole . ProtagonistA did n't know how much longer ProtagonistA could keep going . ProtagonistA's muscles were trembling and ProtagonistA's breath was coming in short , sharp gasps . Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt something touch ProtagonistA's back and ProtagonistA jumped . ProtagonistA spun around to see a large , dark shape looming over ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA let out a terrified whinny and tried to run , but the ground was too slippery and ProtagonistA could n't get traction . The next thing ProtagonistA knew , ProtagonistA was being lifted into the air and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA being carried away from the storm . ProtagonistA could n't believe it when ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was being carried by a giant eagle . The bird must have seen ProtagonistA struggling and decided to help . ProtagonistA felt a wave of relief wash over ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA nuzzled the eagle 's neck in gratitude . Soon , they were far away from the storm and ProtagonistA could finally relax . ProtagonistA had never been so thankful for the help of a stranger . 
ProtagonistA had been meaning to write to ProtagonistB for a long time , but ProtagonistA was beginning to get tired of waiting . Finally , ProtagonistA decided to take matters into ProtagonistA's own hands and write ProtagonistB a letter . In it , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB how ProtagonistA felt about ProtagonistB and how much ProtagonistA cared for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA also told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was getting tired of waiting for ProtagonistB to make a move and that ProtagonistA was going to take action . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB to meet ProtagonistA at the park the following day so that they could talk . The next day , ProtagonistA waited at the park for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB never showed up . ProtagonistA was heartbroken and decided that it was time to move on . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bridesmaid ; ProtagonistB had promised a wedding for ProtagonistA and had lived up to that . But when the day came , ProtagonistA was left at the altar by ProtagonistA's fiancée . It was a crushing blow to ProtagonistA's ego and ProtagonistA's heart . ProtagonistB was sympathetic , but ProtagonistB was also a realist . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that it was time to move on and find someone else . ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's advice and started dating again . ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC and they hit it off immediately . ProtagonistC was everything that ProtagonistA had ever wanted in a wife and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA wanted to spend the rest of ProtagonistA's life with ProtagonistC . They were married a year later and ProtagonistA was finally happy . 
The fire had not yet subsided from the ruins of the old slum when ProtagonistA stood in the doorway of the house where I grew up . I was shocked to see ProtagonistA there , but even more shocked to see the state ProtagonistA was in . ProtagonistA's clothes were tattered and ProtagonistA's hair was wild , like ProtagonistA had been living on the streets for months . But the most shocking thing of all was the look in ProtagonistA's eyes . They were cold and empty , like ProtagonistA had given up on life . I asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was doing there , and ProtagonistA just shrugged . ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA had nowhere else to go . I told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA could stay with me , but ProtagonistA just shook ProtagonistA's head and said ProtagonistA did n't want to be a burden . I insisted , and finally ProtagonistA agreed . It 's been a year since ProtagonistA came to live with me , and ProtagonistA 's slowly starting to piece ProtagonistA's life back together . ProtagonistA 's getting a job and making new friends . I 'm glad I was able to help ProtagonistA , but I know ProtagonistA would have never made it if ProtagonistA had n't come to my door that day . 
ProtagonistA was walking home from work when ProtagonistA noticed the moon . It was so bright and beautiful , like a crystal ball of light . ProtagonistA could n't help but stare at it . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was being pulled into the light . Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt something warm and soft on ProtagonistA's cheek . ProtagonistA realized it was the light from the moon . ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA had been able to see the light from the moon . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked down at a firm blank horizon . ProtagonistA had been walking for days , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and ProtagonistA's stomach was empty . ProtagonistA had been hoping to find a town or a farm , but so far ProtagonistA had seen nothing but empty fields . ProtagonistA was about to give up and lie down to die when ProtagonistA saw a faint light in the distance . ProtagonistA got up and started walking towards it , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was a lamp in a window . ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , and soon ProtagonistA was at the door of the farmhouse . ProtagonistA knocked , and ProtagonistB answered . ProtagonistB was old and wrinkled , but ProtagonistB had a kind face . ProtagonistB invited ProtagonistA in and fed ProtagonistA a warm meal . ProtagonistA went to bed that night feeling hopeful for the first time in a long time . 
ProtagonistA had just gotten off work when ProtagonistA was kidnapped by a shadowy figure . ProtagonistA was thrown into the back of a van and driven to an unknown location . ProtagonistA was terrified of what was going to happen to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was thrown into a dark room and the door was locked . ProtagonistA tried to scream for help but no one could hear ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was left there for days with no food or water . ProtagonistA eventually died of dehydration . ProtagonistA's body was never found . 
ProtagonistA's emails felt for the beast , but ProtagonistA 'd never seen it touch a living thing before . ProtagonistA was beginning to think that maybe the stories ProtagonistA 'd heard about the creature were just that , stories . But then , one day , ProtagonistA saw the beast kill a deer . It was quick and efficient , and ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit of admiration for the creature . 
ProtagonistA had been sneaking into the Ponyville library for weeks now . ProtagonistA was always careful to do it when the library was crowded , so that no one would notice ProtagonistA . But one morning , ProtagonistA was caught red - handed by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked . I'm sorry , ProtagonistA just really wanted to read this book ,  ProtagonistA said . You know you 're not allowed to take books without permission . ProtagonistA 're going to have to leave now . ProtagonistA hung ProtagonistA's head in shame and walked out of the library . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had been caught this time , but ProtagonistA was determined to find a way to get ProtagonistA's hands on that book . 
ProtagonistA hope we 'll be okay ... at least . said ProtagonistA , resting ProtagonistA's hoof on the end of ProtagonistB's hoof . They had been walking for hours , ever since they had seen the fire in the distance . Now , there was no sign of the fire , or any other living creature . The only sound was the crunching of their hooves on the dry , dead grass . I'm sure we 'll be fine ,  said ProtagonistB , although ProtagonistB did n't sound very sure . ProtagonistA nodded , but said nothing . ProtagonistA was tired , and ProtagonistA's hooves hurt . ProtagonistA just wanted to find a place to rest , and maybe some food . Suddenly , ProtagonistB stopped .  What is it ?  asked ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB heard something ,  ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistB's ears perked up . ProtagonistA listened , but ProtagonistA could n't hear anything .  ProtagonistA do n't hear anything ,  ProtagonistA said . Shh !  said ProtagonistB .  There it is again!This time , ProtagonistA could hear it too . It sounded like ... laughter . Who 's there ?  called ProtagonistB . The laughter stopped , and there was silence . Come out , we wo n't hurt you !  called ProtagonistB . Still , there was no response . Maybe we should go ,  said ProtagonistA . But before they could move , they heard the laughter again , this time closer . And then , they saw them . Three creatures , with long , sharp teeth and bright red eyes . Run !  yelled ProtagonistB . And they did . They ran as fast as they could , the creatures hot on their heels . But ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were faster . They made it to the safety of the forest and collapsed , exhausted , on the ground . That was close ,  said ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB's heart racing . Too close ,  said ProtagonistA .  But at least we 're safe now .  
ProtagonistA was a horse who loved to shake ProtagonistA's head and shake ProtagonistA's hoof . ProtagonistA would do it whenever ProtagonistA felt like it , and it always made ProtagonistA feel better . One day , ProtagonistA was feeling particularly down and decided to shake ProtagonistA's head and hoof more than usual . Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt something strange happen . ProtagonistA's head and hoof began to shake uncontrollably ! ProtagonistA was terrified and did n't know what was happening to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA tried to stop shaking , but it was no use . The shaking only got worse and worse until ProtagonistA collapsed to the ground . ProtagonistA lay there shaking and trembling until ProtagonistA finally died . 
ProtagonistA's imagination was an echo of ProtagonistA's senses and a recording of ProtagonistA's thoughts . ProtagonistA was always able to imagine things vividly and in great detail . This made ProtagonistA a very successful writer . ProtagonistA's imagination was like a movie projector , playing back scenes and events in ProtagonistA's mind . ProtagonistA could recall every detail of a scene , no matter how minor . This made ProtagonistA an excellent detective , as ProtagonistA was able to piece together clues that others would miss . 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA knew everything . ProtagonistA was always the one with the answers in class , and ProtagonistA always seemed to be one step ahead of everyone else . But there was much ProtagonistA did n't know . ProtagonistA did n't know what it was like to be in love , or to be heartbroken . ProtagonistA did n't know what it was like to lose someone close to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't know what it was like to feel truly happy , or truly sad . ProtagonistA did n't know anything about the world outside of ProtagonistA's small town . ProtagonistA did n't know what it was like to be truly alive . But ProtagonistA was about to find out . 
ProtagonistA had been working hard all day , and ProtagonistA was ready to go home . ProtagonistA's mer - dog was in a fiddle - and - trumpet , and ProtagonistA's little mare was in a carton . ProtagonistA's master was in command of the galley , and ProtagonistA was ready to go home . 
ProtagonistA sat down on the edge of the bank , crossed ProtagonistA's legs , and stared out into the sea . The sun was setting and the sky was a beautiful orange . The waves were crashing against the shore and the smell of salt was in the air . ProtagonistA felt at peace . ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately and ProtagonistA needed this moment to just relax and clear ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and took a deep breath . Everything was going to be alright . 
ProtagonistA had been sitting on ProtagonistA's rock for hours , blinking ProtagonistA's eyes and wondering how to get back to reality . ProtagonistA had been in a deep sleep when ProtagonistA was suddenly transported to this strange place . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA got here or how to get back . ProtagonistA looked around and saw nothing but rocks and sand . ProtagonistA got up and started walking , hoping to find someone who could help ProtagonistA . After walking for what seemed like hours , ProtagonistA came to a small oasis . ProtagonistA was so thirsty and exhausted , ProtagonistA fell to ProtagonistA's knees and started to drink . Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt someone shaking ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw ProtagonistA's wife standing over ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA fell asleep in the sun again . ProtagonistA 're going to get sunburned . ProtagonistA blinked ProtagonistA's eyes and realized ProtagonistA was back in reality . ProtagonistA had been dreaming the whole time . ProtagonistA was relieved and happy to be back home with ProtagonistA's wife . 
ProtagonistA was quietly trying to get to ProtagonistA's feet when ProtagonistA heard a sharp screech . ProtagonistA froze in place , not knowing what to do . The screech came again , and this time it was followed by the sound of something heavy hitting the ground . ProtagonistA slowly turned ProtagonistA's head to see a large bird perched on a nearby tree . The bird was looking right at ProtagonistA , and it did n't look happy . 
ProtagonistA stood at the edge of the rocky pinnacle , ProtagonistA's hooves glinting in the morning sunlight . ProtagonistA looked out over the vast landscape before ProtagonistA and felt a sense of peace wash over ProtagonistA . It was a beautiful day and ProtagonistA was surrounded by the beauty of nature . ProtagonistA breathed in the fresh air and felt ProtagonistA's muscles relax . It was going to be a good day . 
ProtagonistA was a horse whisperer . ProtagonistA could communicate with horses better than anyone else . When ProtagonistA sat down on ProtagonistA's hind legs and bridled the fierce thirst of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB calmed down and listened to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's life and how ProtagonistA 'd been kicked out of the herd by the alpha male . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about how ProtagonistA 'd been wandering the plains alone for months , searching for a new herd to join . ProtagonistB listened intently and when ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to follow ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA to a herd of wild mustangs and introduced ProtagonistA to the alpha male . ProtagonistA was welcomed into the herd and ProtagonistA finally had a place to call home . 
ProtagonistA had been living in the fort for a few months now and had grown to love the peace and quiet it provided . ProtagonistA was always the first to wake up in the morning and would spend ProtagonistA's time exploring the grounds or reading in the library . The other residents of the fort were friendly , but ProtagonistA never felt like ProtagonistA really fit in . Tonight , ProtagonistA had decided to have dinner in ProtagonistA's own house on the fort grounds . ProtagonistA had been given the house by the fort 's owner and had furnished it with everything ProtagonistA needed . ProtagonistA sat down at the large , white - walled low table and began to eat ProtagonistA's dinner . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the other room . ProtagonistA got up to investigate and found ProtagonistB trying to break into ProtagonistA's house . ProtagonistA ran back to the dining room and grabbed a knife from the table . ProtagonistA ran back to ProtagonistB and stabbed ProtagonistB in the stomach . ProtagonistB collapsed to the ground and ProtagonistA ran back to the dining room , where ProtagonistA called the fort 's security . ProtagonistB was taken away and ProtagonistA was left alone in ProtagonistA's house . ProtagonistA finished ProtagonistA's dinner , but ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that something was watching ProtagonistA . 
There was once , in the sparsely - settled setting of the stone town of Golden ProtagonistA sat , ProtagonistA's eyes closed and listening to the sounds of the surrounding woods . ProtagonistA was a peaceful man , and ProtagonistA found solace in the quiet of the forest . It was a place that ProtagonistA had always felt connected to , ever since ProtagonistA was a young boy . ProtagonistA had many fond memories of exploring the woods with ProtagonistA's friends , and ProtagonistA still loved to take a walk through them whenever ProtagonistA had the chance . Today , however , something was different . ProtagonistA could feel a presence in the forest that ProtagonistA had never felt before . It was a strange feeling , and one that ProtagonistA could n't quite explain . But it was also a feeling that ProtagonistA could n't ignore . Slowly , ProtagonistA stood up and began to follow the feeling , not knowing what ProtagonistA would find . As ProtagonistA walked , the feeling grew stronger and stronger , until ProtagonistA came to a clearing in the woods . And there , in the clearing , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was standing with ProtagonistB back to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB did n't seem to be aware of ProtagonistA's presence . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to speak to ProtagonistB . Slowly , ProtagonistA walked forward , and when ProtagonistA was just a few feet away from ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA cleared ProtagonistA's throat to get ProtagonistB's attention . When ProtagonistB turned around , ProtagonistA was shocked to see that ProtagonistB had the most beautiful eyes ProtagonistA had ever seen . They were a deep blue , and they seemed to look right into ProtagonistA's soul . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could get lost in them forever . ProtagonistB did n't say anything , but ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA . And in that moment , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had found the love of ProtagonistA's life . 
ProtagonistA was sitting at the kitchen table , working on ProtagonistA's homework . ProtagonistB was busy at the stove , cooking dinner . Twilight Sparkle peered over ProtagonistA's shoulder at ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a kind woman , always busy taking care of ProtagonistB's family . Twilight Sparkle could n't help but admire ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA took a deep breath , then ProtagonistA's horn : the thrall of ambition . ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a musician , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to make ProtagonistA's dream come true . ProtagonistA had been practicing for months , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was ready . ProtagonistA was going to audition for the school band . ProtagonistA walked into the auditorium , where the audition was being held , and ProtagonistA saw all of the other kids who were trying out . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and walked up to the stage . ProtagonistA played ProtagonistA's piece flawlessly , and when ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had gotten the part . ProtagonistA was so excited , and ProtagonistA could n't wait to tell ProtagonistA's parents . They had always supported ProtagonistA's dream , and ProtagonistA knew they would be so proud of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had always loved music , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to be able to share ProtagonistA's passion with the world . 
The day I first met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was four and a half years old . ProtagonistA was a chubby little boy with curly brown hair and big blue eyes . ProtagonistA was wearing a pair of overalls and a red t - shirt with a picture of a dinosaur on it . ProtagonistA was sitting in the waiting room at the doctor 's office , swinging ProtagonistA's feet back and forth . I was there with my mom , who was there for a check - up . I was six years old at the time . I was a lot taller than ProtagonistA and skinny as a rail . I had straight blond hair that was always getting in my eyes . I was wearing a pink dress with white lace trim . I remember that ProtagonistA and I started talking and we hit it off right away . We talked about our favorite animals and what we wanted to be when we grew up . ProtagonistA wanted to be a paleontologist and I wanted to be a veterinarian . We were both really interested in dinosaurs . ProtagonistA and I became friends after that day and we would see each other at the doctor 's office from time to time . We would always stop and chat for a bit . A few years later , when I was eight and ProtagonistA was six , we ran into each other at the park . We were both there with our families . We caught up on what had been going on in our lives and then we went our separate ways . I never saw ProtagonistA again after that day , but I always wondered what happened to ProtagonistA . I hope ProtagonistA 's doing well and that ProtagonistA 's still interested in dinosaurs . 
 Are n't ProtagonistA going to go home ?  said Sweetie-6 , scratching his head .  I thought ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was going to go home .   Maybe ProtagonistA changed ProtagonistA's mind ,  said Blue-5 .  I do n't know , but I hope ProtagonistA goes home soon . I 'm getting tired of ProtagonistA being here .   Me too ,  said Sweetie-6 .  I 'm going to bed . Goodnight .  
ProtagonistA was brushing ProtagonistB's hair as the sun rose over the sky . ProtagonistA had been up since before dawn , and ProtagonistA was feeling the effects of a long day . ProtagonistB , however , was fresh and full of energy . ProtagonistB nickered softly as ProtagonistA brushed ProtagonistB's coat , and ProtagonistA could n't help but smile . ProtagonistA had been working on the farm since ProtagonistA was a young boy , and ProtagonistA loved every minute of it . There was something about being out in the open air that just made ProtagonistA feel alive . And ProtagonistB was one of ProtagonistA's favorite parts of the farm . ProtagonistA had raised ProtagonistB from a foal , and ProtagonistB was like a member of the family . ProtagonistA finished brushing ProtagonistB's coat and gave ProtagonistB a pat on the neck .  There ProtagonistB go , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistB 're all set for the day . The mare nickered again and ProtagonistA turned to head back to the house . ProtagonistA had a lot of work to do today , but ProtagonistA would n't trade it for anything in the world . 
ProtagonistA had been a force in the history of the land for many years . ProtagonistA had passed away a few years before , but ProtagonistB had not forgotten ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB remembered all of the good times they had together and how ProtagonistA had always been there for ProtagonistB . Even though ProtagonistA was gone , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA would always be with ProtagonistA in spirit . 
ProtagonistA had always been a patient man . ProtagonistA would sit for hours waiting for the perfect moment to strike . ProtagonistB had always admired that about ProtagonistA . When ProtagonistB was younger , ProtagonistB would often find ProtagonistA sitting in the same spot , waiting for the perfect fish to swim by . ProtagonistA never got frustrated , or angry . ProtagonistA would just sit there patiently , waiting . ProtagonistB had been sitting on the dock for hours , waiting for a bite . ProtagonistA had always told ProtagonistB that patience was key when fishing . ProtagonistB was determined to catch a fish today . ProtagonistB had been out there since early morning , and it was now evening . The sun was beginning to set , and the moon was leveling off . ProtagonistA had always said that the best time to fish was at night , under the light of the moon . ProtagonistB was getting tired , and was about to give up for the night , when ProtagonistB felt a tug on ProtagonistB's line . ProtagonistB reeled in the line , and sure enough , ProtagonistB had caught a fish . ProtagonistB was so excited , ProtagonistB forgot all about ProtagonistB's tiredness . ProtagonistB shouted for ProtagonistA to come over . ProtagonistA came over , and was so proud of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had finally caught a fish . 
First known , at the end of the last century , to be the daughter of ProtagonistA , one of the statistics of Champlain , in that country , was that , after ProtagonistA's father had been dead for ten years , ProtagonistA had the advantage of four years ' education , and knew enough of the world , to be a good office seeker , and to be a good lever - broker , and a good carpenter , and , best of all , a good hatter . 
ProtagonistA stood on ProtagonistA's hind legs , took a long breath , and surveyed the room . ProtagonistA had been cooped up in this house for far too long , and ProtagonistA was ready to explore . ProtagonistA had always been a curious cat , and ProtagonistA was determined to find out what was beyond the four walls of ProtagonistA's home . ProtagonistA had heard the other animals in the neighborhood talking , and they all seemed to think that there was some great big world out there . ProtagonistA was n't sure what to believe , but ProtagonistA was determined to find out for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had seen the humans leave the house each day , and ProtagonistA knew that they must go somewhere . Maybe they knew something that ProtagonistA did n't . ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA would follow them the next time they left and see where they went . The next day , ProtagonistA waited by the door , and when the humans left , ProtagonistA followed them . ProtagonistA was surprised to find that they went to a place called  work .  ProtagonistA was n't sure what that was , but ProtagonistA was determined to find out . ProtagonistA followed the humans to work every day for a week , and ProtagonistA began to piece together what it was that they did . ProtagonistA was fascinated by the way they interacted with each other and the things they did . Eventually , ProtagonistA got brave enough to venture out into the world on ProtagonistA's own . ProtagonistA found that there was so much to see and do , and ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had followed the humans out of ProtagonistA's house . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never be content to stay inside four walls again . 
ProtagonistA gave a hoof and ProtagonistA's ears a slight twitching . It was time to go . ProtagonistA had been waiting for this moment for years . ProtagonistA was a horse , and ProtagonistA was about to embark on the greatest adventure of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistB , had been planning this trip for months , and now it was finally time to go . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was excited , but ProtagonistA was also a little bit nervous . After all , they were going to be riding across the country on horseback . But ProtagonistA was up for the challenge . ProtagonistA had been trained for this trip , and ProtagonistA was ready to go . ProtagonistB saddled ProtagonistA up and they set off . The first few days were easy enough , but as they got further into their journey , the terrain became more difficult . ProtagonistA was happy to have ProtagonistB by ProtagonistA's side , and ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to help ProtagonistB navigate the difficult terrain . They rode for hours each day , and ProtagonistA never once complained . ProtagonistA was determined to make it to the end of the journey . And finally , after weeks of riding , they arrived at their destination . ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA had made it across the country on horseback , and they were both exhausted . But they had accomplished something amazing , and they would never forget the adventure they had shared . 
ProtagonistA had always known that ProtagonistA had a lot of talent . ProtagonistA had always been good at everything ProtagonistA tried . But ProtagonistA never really pursued any of ProtagonistA's talents because ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life the way it was . ProtagonistA had a good job , a nice house , and a loving family . But one day , ProtagonistA decided to take a risk and pursue ProtagonistA's talent for writing . ProtagonistA had always enjoyed writing stories , and ProtagonistA was pretty good at it . So ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's job , sold ProtagonistA's house , and moved to Hollywood to become a writer . It was a big risk , but it paid off . ProtagonistA's first screenplay was a huge success . ProtagonistA won an Academy Award for it , and ProtagonistA was able to provide a comfortable life for ProtagonistA's family . 
ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA pranced through the air , bouncing on ProtagonistA's wings , ProtagonistA's hooves floating in the swirling air . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could fly forever . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a loud noise . It sounded like a thunderstorm was coming . ProtagonistA did n't want to get caught in the storm , so ProtagonistA started to fly towards the nearest cave . But the storm was getting closer and closer , and soon ProtagonistA was surrounded by dark clouds . Lightning flashed and thunder roared . ProtagonistA was getting scared . ProtagonistA tried to fly faster , but it was no use . The storm was too strong . Soon , ProtagonistA was blown into a cave by the wind . ProtagonistA landed with a thud . The cave was dark and damp , and ProtagonistA was very scared . ProtagonistA wanted to go home . But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't fly in the storm . ProtagonistA would have to wait it out . ProtagonistA curled up in a corner of the cave and tried to go to sleep . But it was hard to sleep with the thunder crashing and the lightning flashing . ProtagonistA was glad when the storm finally died down and ProtagonistA could fly home . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's saddle and watched the sunset . ProtagonistA was a cowboy and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA loved the smell of the saddle and the feel of the horse beneath ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA loved the sound of the wind in the trees and the sound of the cattle in the distance . ProtagonistA loved the way the sun felt on ProtagonistA's face and the way the stars shone in the night sky . ProtagonistA was happy and content . 
ProtagonistA rode silently toward ProtagonistA's cabin , ProtagonistA's eyes half - closed and ProtagonistA's mind racing in its mind 's eye . ProtagonistA was thinking about the day 's events and how ProtagonistA could have handled them better . ProtagonistA was also thinking about the future and what ProtagonistA wanted to do with ProtagonistA's life . When ProtagonistA arrived at ProtagonistA's cabin , ProtagonistA dismounted and went inside . ProtagonistA sat down in ProtagonistA's chair and sighed . It had been a long day and ProtagonistA was tired . ProtagonistA was just about to drift off to sleep when ProtagonistA heard a noise outside . ProtagonistA got up and went to the window to see what it was . ProtagonistA saw a figure moving around in the shadows . ProtagonistA was about to go outside and investigate when ProtagonistA heard a voice in ProtagonistA's head . It was ProtagonistA's conscience . It told ProtagonistA to be careful and not to do anything rash . ProtagonistA listened to it and decided to wait and see what the figure was up to . ProtagonistA watched as it came closer to the cabin . ProtagonistA could see that it was a person . They were carrying something in their hand . ProtagonistA was about to go outside and confront the person when they suddenly dropped what they were carrying and ran away . ProtagonistA was curious about what they had dropped , so ProtagonistA went outside to investigate . ProtagonistA found a bag of money at ProtagonistA's feet . ProtagonistA picked it up and looked inside . ProtagonistA saw that there were a lot of bills inside . ProtagonistA was about to take it back inside when ProtagonistA heard the voice in ProtagonistA's head again . It told ProtagonistA to take the money and use it to help others . ProtagonistA thought about it for a moment and then decided to listen to the voice . ProtagonistA put the money in ProtagonistA's pocket and went back inside . ProtagonistA sat down and thought about what ProtagonistA had just done . ProtagonistA knew that it was the right thing to do and that ProtagonistA would never forget it . 
ProtagonistA sat and watched the rain , knowing ProtagonistA's friends would be there to help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately and was feeling down . ProtagonistA's friends had been there for ProtagonistA though , and ProtagonistA knew they would be there to help ProtagonistA through this tough time . 
I know this is a story about ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB , but even it ca n't be denied that it 's a story for the ages . It was a time when the world was a different place , and ProtagonistB was a different man . ProtagonistB was a man of ProtagonistB's word , and ProtagonistB did n't take kindly to people who did n't live up to their promises . That 's why , when ProtagonistB found out that ProtagonistD had left ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB was furious . ProtagonistB went to ProtagonistD's house and demanded that ProtagonistD marry ProtagonistC or ProtagonistB would kill ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD did n't take ProtagonistB seriously and laughed in ProtagonistB's face . That 's when ProtagonistB pulled out ProtagonistB's gun and shot ProtagonistD . ProtagonistB did n't think twice about it , and ProtagonistB did n't regret it either . After that , ProtagonistB went back to ProtagonistC and told ProtagonistC what ProtagonistB had done . ProtagonistC was shocked , but ProtagonistC did n't say anything . ProtagonistB was a changed man after that . ProtagonistB was more distant and ProtagonistB drank more . ProtagonistA tried to talk to ProtagonistB about it , but ProtagonistB would just brush ProtagonistA off . Eventually , ProtagonistA stopped trying . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would never be the same . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's rock and stared into the water . ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how it had led ProtagonistA to this moment . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner , but ProtagonistA had never felt so alone as ProtagonistA did now . ProtagonistA had always been content to just sit and stare at the water , but now ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA needed to do something more . ProtagonistA needed to find a way to connect with other people . ProtagonistA was n't sure how to do that , but ProtagonistA was determined to find a way . 
ProtagonistA was about to take ProtagonistA's maiden - head to court . ProtagonistA was a young man , and this was ProtagonistA's first time in court . ProtagonistA was nervous , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to do this . ProtagonistA had to stand up for ProtagonistA and for what ProtagonistA believed in . ProtagonistA was going to take on the establishment , and ProtagonistA was going to win . 
There was once ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had no money to buy food , so ProtagonistA would often go to the local grocery store and beg for food . The grocery store employees would sometimes give ProtagonistA food , but other times they would just tell ProtagonistA to leave . One day , ProtagonistA went to the grocery store and saw a sign that said  Help Wanted .  ProtagonistA went inside and asked the manager if ProtagonistA could have the job . The manager agreed to hire ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA has been working there ever since . 
ProtagonistA sat on the bank , hunting for ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA had been looking for them for hours , but ProtagonistA could n't find them anywhere . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw a group of them sitting on a log in the distance . ProtagonistA was so happy to see them that ProtagonistA ran over and hugged them all . 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day . ProtagonistA's boss had just chewed ProtagonistA out in front of the whole office , and ProtagonistA was feeling embarrassed and angry . So when ProtagonistA's co - worker said something stupid , ProtagonistA lost it . ProtagonistA threw down ProtagonistA's chair and leaned forward in the air , ready to give the guy a piece of his mind . But before ProtagonistA could say anything , ProtagonistA felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's chest and collapsed to the floor . It turned out ProtagonistA had a heart attack , and ProtagonistA was lucky to be alive . 
ProtagonistA had been walking through the woods for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting tired . ProtagonistA had been following a trail , but it seemed to have disappeared . ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA was going in circles . ProtagonistA sat down to rest on a log , and ProtagonistA looked up at the moon . It was so bright , and it shone between the trees . But ProtagonistA's eyes told ProtagonistA otherwise . ProtagonistA was sure the moon was getting bigger and brighter . ProtagonistA got up and started to walk again , and ProtagonistA came to a clearing . In the middle of the clearing was a big rock , and on the rock was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was beautiful , and ProtagonistB was wearing a white dress . ProtagonistB's hair was long and flowing , and ProtagonistB had a crown of flowers on ProtagonistB's head . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was dreaming , but ProtagonistA did n't want to wake up . 
ProtagonistA woke up groggy and disoriented . ProtagonistA looked around ProtagonistA's messy bedroom , trying to remember what ProtagonistA had been doing all morning . ProtagonistA could n't recall going to bed the night before , or what ProtagonistA had done the day before that . ProtagonistA felt a wave of panic wash over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA could n't remember anything from the past week . ProtagonistA tried to stand up , but ProtagonistA's legs felt like jelly and ProtagonistA collapsed back onto the bed . What was happening to ProtagonistA ? 
ProtagonistA was a Fox - man of the valley , and in those days , the Fox - men were at war with the evil forces of the world . They fought against both good and evil , and even in the darkest hours of the war , when their very survival depended on it , ProtagonistA kept a close watch on ProtagonistA's allies and ProtagonistA's sons . ProtagonistA was a brave and noble warrior , and ProtagonistA would do whatever it took to protect ProtagonistA's people . One day , while ProtagonistA was out on patrol , ProtagonistA spotted a group of enemy soldiers moving in on ProtagonistA's village . ProtagonistA quickly alerted ProtagonistA's fellow Fox - men , and they were able to defend the village and drive the enemy away . But not before ProtagonistA was seriously injured in the battle . ProtagonistA was taken to ProtagonistB . But ProtagonistA's injuries were too severe , and ProtagonistA died a few days later . ProtagonistA was a hero , and ProtagonistA will never be forgotten . ProtagonistA's bravery and selflessness in the face of evil inspired many others to follow in ProtagonistA's footsteps and fight for the freedom of the Fox - men . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider . ProtagonistA was conceived in the winter of ProtagonistA's year , seventeen months after ProtagonistA's father , Skylark of the Magic Gardens , and ProtagonistB , had met . This made ProtagonistA the odd one out in ProtagonistA's family , and ProtagonistA was always conscious of it . ProtagonistA tried to make the best of it , though , and rose through the ranks of the great Kingdom of Equestria from its tier - one position , into a far more stable , if very large , position . ProtagonistA made many friends along the way , but always felt like ProtagonistA was on the outside looking in . One day , ProtagonistA decided to confront ProtagonistA's feelings head on . ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's parents and asked them why ProtagonistA had been conceived so long after they had met . They looked at each other , and then ProtagonistB spoke . Your father and ProtagonistB were always meant to be together ,  ProtagonistB said .  But we did n't want to rush into things . We wanted to make sure that we were really ready for a family . So we waited , and ProtagonistA were the result of that wait . ProtagonistA were worth it , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 're our special little snowflake . ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistA's parents ' words , and finally felt like ProtagonistA belonged . ProtagonistA was their special little snowflake , and ProtagonistA was proud of it . 
ProtagonistA is sitting with ProtagonistA's wings folded , legs crossed at the navel . ProtagonistA looks around the room and sees the other birds perched on their perches . Some are preening their feathers , others are sleeping . ProtagonistA feels a little out of place . ProtagonistA 's never been one for sitting still for long periods of time . ProtagonistA starts to fidget and ProtagonistA's wings begin to flap . Suddenly , ProtagonistA loses ProtagonistA's balance and falls off ProtagonistA's perch . ProtagonistA flaps ProtagonistA's wings frantically as ProtagonistA tries to regain ProtagonistA's footing , but it 's no use . ProtagonistA falls to the ground with a thud . The other birds look at ProtagonistA with pity as ProtagonistA picks ProtagonistA up and dusts ProtagonistA off . ProtagonistA hangs ProtagonistA's head in shame and decides to leave the room . ProtagonistA 'll come back later when ProtagonistA 's feeling more like ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was exhausted . ProtagonistA had been searching through the hospital wing for hours , looking for the right book . ProtagonistA had been to the blue drawers a hundred times , but ProtagonistA just could n't find what ProtagonistA was looking for . ProtagonistA was about to give up and go to ProtagonistA's office when ProtagonistA heard a voice in the crowd . ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistA , over here!It was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was so relieved to see ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB , thank goodness . ProtagonistA 've been looking for ProtagonistB everywhere . What are ProtagonistA looking for , ProtagonistA book . The one with the blue cover . ProtagonistA need to find it before ProtagonistA's appointment . ProtagonistA , that book is in ProtagonistA's office . ProtagonistB saw it there earlier . ProtagonistA could n't believe it . ProtagonistA had been looking for hours and the book was in ProtagonistA's office the whole time . Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA do n't know what ProtagonistA would have done without ProtagonistB . Anytime , ProtagonistA . Now , let 's get ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's appointment .  
ProtagonistA stood at the edge of the cliff , ProtagonistA's head down and eyes wide , looking out into the ocean beyond . ProtagonistA could see the waves crashing against the rocks below , and the seagulls flying overhead . ProtagonistA had always loved the ocean , and ProtagonistA knew that this was ProtagonistA's final moments . ProtagonistA had been diagnosed with cancer , and ProtagonistA had made the decision to end ProtagonistA's life on ProtagonistA's own terms . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and took a deep breath , then stepped off the cliff . 
I had n't heard of ProtagonistA until ProtagonistA was gone , but ProtagonistA was exactly what I am . I am a person who is always looking for the next best thing . I get bored easily and need constant stimulation . ProtagonistA was the same way . ProtagonistA was always looking for new adventures and new people to meet . ProtagonistA was never content to stay in one place for too long . I met ProtagonistA when I was working as a waiter in a restaurant . ProtagonistA came in one day and I could tell ProtagonistA was different from the other customers . ProtagonistA had an air of excitement about ProtagonistA that was contagious . I struck up a conversation with ProtagonistA and we hit it off immediately . We became fast friends and would go on adventures together . We would go hiking in the mountains , exploring new cities , and just generally having a good time . ProtagonistA was the best friend I ever had . I was devastated when ProtagonistA died suddenly of a heart attack . I had n't seen ProtagonistA in a few months and I had no idea ProtagonistA was sick . I realized then that I had taken ProtagonistA for granted . I will never forget ProtagonistA and I will always cherish the memories I have of ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA leaned ProtagonistA's head back against the window of the airplane and peered into the sea below . ProtagonistA had always loved flying , and the ocean was one of ProtagonistA's favorite things to look at from above . It was so vast and blue and beautiful . ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace looking at it . 
ProtagonistA turned at the last minute to see ProtagonistB sitting on the bank watching ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was about to go into the water to fish but ProtagonistB stopped ProtagonistA .  What are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked .  ProtagonistA 're going to get wet .   ProtagonistA know ,  ProtagonistA said .  But ProtagonistA really want to catch a fish .   ProtagonistA 're not going to catch any fish if ProtagonistA do n't have a bait ,  ProtagonistB said .  And ProtagonistA 're not going to have any bait if ProtagonistA do n't have a worm .   ProtagonistA know ,  ProtagonistA said .  But ProtagonistA really want to catch a fish .  ProtagonistB sighed and shook ProtagonistB's head .  Fine ,  ProtagonistB said .  But ProtagonistB 'm not going to help ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA smiled and went into the water . ProtagonistA did n't catch any fish but ProtagonistA had a lot of fun . 
ProtagonistA sat looking up from the book lying on ProtagonistA's lap in the shade of a tree . ProtagonistA had been reading for hours , but ProtagonistA was so engrossed in the story that ProtagonistA had lost track of time . The sun had shifted in the sky and was now shining directly in ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA squinted and put a hand up to shade ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was the only one left in the park . ProtagonistA got up and brushed the dirt off ProtagonistA's pants . ProtagonistA put the book in ProtagonistA's backpack and started walking home . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's saddled legs and stared down at ProtagonistA's hooves , wondering what the terror of the demon spell cast down on the citizens should have been like . ProtagonistA had been in the thick of the battle , fighting tooth and nail against the demons that had come to destroy their town . But in the end , the demons had been too strong and too powerful . They had cast a spell that had terrorized the citizens and left them begging for mercy . ProtagonistA had been the only one who had been able to resist the spell and now ProtagonistA was the only one left . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do or where to go . ProtagonistA was the only one left who could save the town , but ProtagonistA did n't know how . ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's saddle legs and stared down at ProtagonistA's hooves , wondering what ProtagonistA could do to save the town . 
When ProtagonistA's parents must have been sleeping soundly , ProtagonistA had a passion for all things water - related , from swimming to pot - dancing . One night , while they slept , ProtagonistA snuck out of the house and made ProtagonistA's way to the river . ProtagonistA stripped down to ProtagonistA's birthday suit and jumped in , feeling the cool water envelop ProtagonistA's body . ProtagonistA swam and played for hours , only coming out when the sun began to rise . ProtagonistA tiptoed back into the house , hoping not to wake ProtagonistA's parents , but alas , they were already awake and waiting for ProtagonistA .  Where have ProtagonistA been ?  they asked .  We 've been worried sick !  ProtagonistA simply smiled and said ,  ProtagonistA went for a swim .  
ProtagonistA leaned against the tree , ProtagonistA's eyes closed and ProtagonistA's mouth hanging open . ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and was now exhausted . ProtagonistA was n't sure where ProtagonistA was , or where ProtagonistA was going . ProtagonistA just kept walking , until ProtagonistA could n't walk any further . ProtagonistA was thirsty , and hungry , but ProtagonistA did n't have the energy to search for food or water . ProtagonistA just wanted to rest . ProtagonistA was n't sure how long ProtagonistA had been leaning against the tree , but ProtagonistA must have dozed off , because the next thing ProtagonistA knew , someone was shaking ProtagonistA awake . ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes to see ProtagonistB standing in front of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was holding a canteen of water and a bag of food . ProtagonistB offered them to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA gratefully accepted . ProtagonistA drank the water and ate the food , and then asked ProtagonistB who ProtagonistB was . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's name was Sarah , and ProtagonistB had been out for a walk when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA ProtagonistA's name , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB it was ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA then asked ProtagonistB where ProtagonistA was , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA was in the forest . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for the food and water , and then asked ProtagonistB to show ProtagonistA the way out of the forest . ProtagonistB agreed , and they set off together . ProtagonistA was very grateful to ProtagonistB , and they became good friends . 
ProtagonistA was a horse who loved to stare at the world . ProtagonistA would raise ProtagonistA's hoof to ProtagonistA's face and just stare . ProtagonistA loved the way the world looked from up high . One day , ProtagonistA's owner decided to take ProtagonistA for a ride . ProtagonistA was so excited . ProtagonistA loved going for rides . But this time , something was different . ProtagonistA's owner was going too fast . ProtagonistA was scared . ProtagonistA tried to raise ProtagonistA's hoof to ProtagonistA's face , but ProtagonistA could n't . ProtagonistA was holding on for dear life . Finally , ProtagonistA's owner slowed down and ProtagonistA was able to raise ProtagonistA's hoof to ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA was so relieved . 
ProtagonistA stood there , still wearing ProtagonistA's royal blue dress . It was a little tight in the chest and the waist , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA loved how ProtagonistA looked in it . ProtagonistA felt like a princess . ProtagonistA twirled around , the skirt spinning out around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA laughed and then stopped when ProtagonistA saw the look on ProtagonistB's face . ProtagonistA , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked , ProtagonistB's voice tight . I'm twirling ,  ProtagonistA said , still spinning . You're a boy ,  ProtagonistB said .  Boys do n't wear dresses . I do n't care ,  ProtagonistA said , pouting .  ProtagonistA like this dress . Well , ProtagonistA ca n't wear it ,  ProtagonistB said .  It 's not appropriate . It 's just a dress ,  ProtagonistA said .  What 's the big deal?The big deal is that ProtagonistA 're a boy and boys do n't wear dresses ,  ProtagonistB said .  Now go upstairs and change into some clothes that are appropriate for a boy . ProtagonistA did n't want to change , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to . ProtagonistA slowly trudged up the stairs , the skirt of ProtagonistA's dress dragging behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA changed into a pair of jeans and a t - shirt and then went back downstairs . ProtagonistA did n't look at ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA walked past ProtagonistB and went outside to play . ProtagonistA was determined to find a way to wear that dress again . 
ProtagonistA wandered the quiet , wet wasteland of the forest , ProtagonistA's eyes scanning the thicket just outside the thicket . ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and ProtagonistA's stomach was growling . ProtagonistA was just about to give up and turn back when ProtagonistA saw something shining in the distance . ProtagonistA walked towards it , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized it was a golden apple . ProtagonistA picked it up and brushed the dirt off of it . ProtagonistA took a bite , and it was the most delicious thing ProtagonistA had ever tasted . ProtagonistA ate the whole thing , and then ProtagonistA felt a sudden surge of energy . ProtagonistA walked for hours more , and ProtagonistA eventually found ProtagonistA's way out of the forest . ProtagonistA was tired , but ProtagonistA felt great . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget the day ProtagonistA found the golden apple . 
ProtagonistA was the only member of ProtagonistA's family who had not been disemboweled . ProtagonistA was the black sheep , the outcast , the one who did n't fit in . ProtagonistA's parents and siblings had all been killed in a gruesome ritualistic murder , but ProtagonistA had been spared . ProtagonistA did n't know why , and ProtagonistA did n't know how long ProtagonistA's luck would last . ProtagonistA was constantly looking over ProtagonistA's shoulder , waiting for the axe to fall . ProtagonistA had no idea who was behind the murders , or why they had been targeted . All ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistA was next . One night , ProtagonistA was asleep in ProtagonistA's bed when ProtagonistA was awakened by a noise . ProtagonistA got up to investigate and found ProtagonistA's parents ' killer in ProtagonistA's room . Before ProtagonistA could scream , ProtagonistA was silenced with a knife to the throat . ProtagonistA's body was found the next morning , disemboweled and mutilated . ProtagonistA was the final victim in a string of murders that shocked the small town ProtagonistA lived in . To this day , the killer has never been found . 
ProtagonistA was sitting on ProtagonistA's own , with a book in one hand and a pile of feathers in the other . It was a peaceful day , and ProtagonistA was enjoying the quiet . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a loud noise . It sounded like someone was coming towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA got up and looked around , but ProtagonistA could n't see anyone . ProtagonistA decided to go back to ProtagonistA's book , but the noise got louder and closer . ProtagonistA got up again and looked around , but still could n't see anyone . Just as ProtagonistA was about to go back to ProtagonistA's book , ProtagonistA saw a small , furry creature running towards ProtagonistA . It was a mouse ! The mouse ran right up to ProtagonistA and stopped . It looked at ProtagonistA with its big , brown eyes and then ran away . ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA just sat there for a moment , with ProtagonistA's book in one hand and a pile of feathers in the other . 
ProtagonistA was a horse , and a very good horse at that . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's way around the farm better than any other horse , and ProtagonistA was always the one that the other horses went to for advice . So when ProtagonistB came to the farm , ProtagonistA was the first to welcome ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB , said ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's hoof hovering over the apple cart .  It 's nice to meet ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA 'm sure ProtagonistB 'll like it here on the farm .  ProtagonistB was a bit hesitant at first , but ProtagonistB soon warmed up to ProtagonistA and the other horses on the farm . ProtagonistB loved the apple cart , and ProtagonistB would always beg ProtagonistA for an apple when ProtagonistA came by . One day , ProtagonistA came by the apple cart and ProtagonistB was n't there . ProtagonistA looked around for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB was nowhere to be found . ProtagonistA eventually found ProtagonistB in the pasture , grazing on some grass .  ProtagonistB , what are ProtagonistB doing out here ? You know ProtagonistB 're not supposed to be in the pasture .   ProtagonistB 'm sorry , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB just wanted to try something new .   Well , you ca n't just go off and try new things without letting someone know . ProtagonistB could have gotten lost .   ProtagonistB 'm sorry , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB wo n't do it again .   ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB wo n't , ProtagonistB . Just be careful from now on , okay ?   ProtagonistB will , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB promise .  
ProtagonistA sat down on the bench opposite ProtagonistC and looked around . It was a beautiful day , and the park was full of people enjoying the weather . ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB and a young couple playing frisbee . ProtagonistA smiled and turned to ProtagonistC .  Is n't it a great day ?  ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistC just stared at ProtagonistA and then got up and walked away . ProtagonistA was surprised , but shrugged it off and went back to people watching . 
It was a chilly , dark and stormy morning , and ProtagonistA was helping ProtagonistB , load ProtagonistB's car when the first hysterical hearers started peering through the panes of the neighboring windows . ProtagonistB had been diagnosed with a rare and incurable disease , and the doctors had told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB only had a few months to live . ProtagonistA was determined to make the most of the time they had left together , and so ProtagonistA had decided to take ProtagonistB on a road trip to see all the sights that ProtagonistB had always wanted to see . The first few days of the trip were great . They laughed , they talked , they made love . But as ProtagonistB's condition started to deteriorate , the fun turned to worry and then to fear . ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to keep ProtagonistB comfortable , but there was only so much ProtagonistA could do . And then , on the morning of the fifth day , ProtagonistB passed away peacefully in ProtagonistB's sleep . ProtagonistA was devastated , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to keep going . ProtagonistA had promised ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would see the trip through to the end . So , with a heavy heart , ProtagonistA loaded ProtagonistB's body into the car and continued on their journey . ProtagonistA stopped at all the places that ProtagonistB had wanted to see , and ProtagonistA took pictures and made notes so that ProtagonistA could share the experience with others . It was a difficult journey , but in the end , it was one that ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA made . It was a way to honor ProtagonistB and to keep ProtagonistB's memory alive . 
ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way back to ProtagonistA's office when ProtagonistA saw the great city of Ponyville once again . ProtagonistA had been away on business for a few weeks and was glad to be home . As ProtagonistA walked through the streets , ProtagonistA saw many familiar faces and felt a sense of comfort . ProtagonistA knew that no matter what happened in the outside world , ProtagonistA could always count on the people of Ponyville to be there for ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA has been seen seated on the floor , ProtagonistA's heels creaking slightly , the air of a confined space , and ProtagonistA sits quietly , a slight air of nervousness attached to ProtagonistA , as if ProtagonistA were about to lose ProtagonistA's temper . ProtagonistA looks around the room , taking in the other people seated in a circle around ProtagonistA . They all have similar expressions of nervousness and anxiety . ProtagonistA can feel the sweat beginning to form on ProtagonistA's forehead and ProtagonistA wipes it away with ProtagonistA's sleeve . ProtagonistA takes a deep breath and wills ProtagonistA to calm down . ProtagonistA does n't want to lose ProtagonistA's temper , not here , not now . ProtagonistA knows that if ProtagonistA does , ProtagonistA 'll only make things worse . The group is waiting for ProtagonistB to arrive and begin the meeting . ProtagonistA has been to these types of meetings before , but this one feels different . ProtagonistA ca n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but there is an air of tension in the room that was n't there before . Maybe it 's because they 're discussing such a sensitive topic , or maybe it 's because they 're all so on edge . Finally , ProtagonistB arrives and the meeting begins . ProtagonistA tries to pay attention , but ProtagonistA ca n't focus . ProtagonistA's mind keeps wandering back to the last meeting ProtagonistA was in , where things had gotten out of hand . ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's temper and said some things ProtagonistA regretted . ProtagonistA does n't want to make the same mistake again , but ProtagonistA can feel ProtagonistA's anger bubbling up inside of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA takes a few deep breaths and tries to focus on the discussion , but it 's hard . The meeting goes on for what feels like hours . ProtagonistA's mind is racing and ProtagonistA can feel ProtagonistA's temper slowly slipping . ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA needs to leave before ProtagonistA says something ProtagonistA 'll regret , but ProtagonistA does n't want to make a scene . ProtagonistA can feel everyone 's eyes on ProtagonistA , and the pressure is too much . Finally , ProtagonistA ca n't take it anymore and ProtagonistA explodes . ProtagonistA yells at ProtagonistB , telling ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB 's a fraud and that this whole meeting is a waste of time . ProtagonistA then storms out of the room , leaving the others behind . ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA should n't have lost ProtagonistA's temper like that , but ProtagonistA ca n't help it . ProtagonistA 's so angry and frustrated . ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA needs to calm down , but ProtagonistA ca n't . ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA 's about to explode . ProtagonistA goes for a walk , trying to clear ProtagonistA's head , but it does n't help . ProtagonistA 's still so angry and ProtagonistA does n't know what to do . 
ProtagonistA leaned against the tree , ProtagonistA's hooves tugging at the bark of the tree . ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA liked it . The bark was rough and itchy and it made ProtagonistA's hooves sore . But it was also cool and shady and the bark felt good against ProtagonistA's back . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and sighed . It was nice to just stand there and rest . 
ProtagonistA leaned against the tree , ProtagonistA's gaze scanning the atmosphere . It was a beautiful day outside , and ProtagonistA was enjoying the peacefulness of nature . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes nearby . ProtagonistA's heart quickened as ProtagonistA wondered what could be causing it . Was it a animal , or something more sinister ? ProtagonistA tensed up , preparing for the worst , when a small rabbit hopped out from the undergrowth . ProtagonistA let out a sigh of relief and laughed at ProtagonistA for being so jumpy . It was just a harmless rabbit after all . 
ProtagonistA stood there , ProtagonistA's hooves resting on the ground . ProtagonistA was a big horse , and ProtagonistA knew it . ProtagonistA was the king of the pasture , and ProtagonistA liked it that way . But today , something was different . There was a new horse in the pasture , and ProtagonistA did n't like it . The new horse was smaller than ProtagonistA , and it did n't seem to know its place . ProtagonistA did n't like that . ProtagonistA wanted to show the new horse who was boss . So , ProtagonistA walked over to the new horse , and ProtagonistA gave it a good kick . The new horse yelped in surprise , and ProtagonistA felt satisfied . ProtagonistA had shown the new horse who was in charge . 
ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA was exhausted . ProtagonistA had been planning to camp for the night , but ProtagonistA could n't find a good spot . ProtagonistA had seen a few places that would work , but they were all taken by other campers . Finally , ProtagonistA came to a clearing and saw a tree . It looked like it would be a perfect spot to camp for the night . ProtagonistA sat down on the side of the tree , ProtagonistA's leg dangling past the tip . ProtagonistA was just about to drift off to sleep when ProtagonistA heard a noise . It sounded like someone was coming towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA sat up and looked around , but ProtagonistA could n't see anyone . ProtagonistA was about to lie back down when ProtagonistA heard the noise again . This time , it sounded like it was coming from the other side of the tree . ProtagonistA slowly got to ProtagonistA's feet and crept around the tree . ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA's eyes . There was a bear on the other side of the tree , and it was coming towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA turned and ran as fast as ProtagonistA could . ProtagonistA did n't stop running until ProtagonistA was back at ProtagonistA's car . ProtagonistA had never been so scared in ProtagonistA's life . 
ProtagonistA was having a great day . ProtagonistA was out in the park , enjoying the sunshine and the fresh air . And ProtagonistA had a bag of delicious cupcakes . ProtagonistA was just about to take a bite of one when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB watching ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was a girl , and ProtagonistB was smiling . ProtagonistA could n't help but smile back . ProtagonistB came over and sat down next to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as Twilight Sparkle . ProtagonistA was instantly drawn to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was so pretty and seemed so friendly . They began chatting and ProtagonistA soon found out that ProtagonistB was also a big fan of cupcakes . In fact , ProtagonistB was out of cupcakes . And ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA could share ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was more than happy to share ProtagonistA's cupcakes with ProtagonistB . And ProtagonistA could n't stop smiling . ProtagonistB was so girlish and pretty . It was confusing , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA was just happy to be spending time with ProtagonistB . 
The watch - thing , the one that was attached to the dress that ProtagonistA put on ProtagonistA's head , was ticking away in the dark . It was the only sound in the room , and it was starting to get on ProtagonistA's nerves . ProtagonistA had been in the room for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting tired of the darkness and the silence . ProtagonistA was starting to think that maybe ProtagonistA should just take the watch - thing off ProtagonistA's head and leave the room , when ProtagonistA heard a voice .  ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA still in there ?  The voice was faint and it sounded like it was coming from the other side of the door . ProtagonistA got up and went to the door , and ProtagonistA put ProtagonistA's ear to it .  Yes , ProtagonistA 'm still here ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm not sure how much longer ProtagonistA can stay in here .   Do n't worry , ProtagonistA ,  the voice said .  I 'm coming to get ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA heard the sound of footsteps getting closer , and then the door opened . A light came on , and ProtagonistA saw the face of ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA might need some company ,  ProtagonistB said .  Come on , let 's get out of here .  ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB left the room , and they did n't look back . 
ProtagonistA was at the dinner party waiting for ProtagonistB , to apologize for not coming sooner . ProtagonistB had promised ProtagonistA ProtagonistB would be there , but ProtagonistB was always busy with ProtagonistB's royal duties . ProtagonistA did n't mind , though . ProtagonistA was used to waiting for ProtagonistB . Finally , ProtagonistB arrived and they had a wonderful time catching up . ProtagonistB apologized for being late and promised to make it up to ProtagonistA . They laughed and talked all night , and ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had waited for ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA blinked at the moon and saw the glitter of the friends ' tears around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it before . It was beautiful . 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friend were standing on the edge of a stream . The sun was setting and the water was sparkling . ProtagonistA's friend said ,  I bet ProtagonistA ca n't skip a rock across the water .  ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA bet ProtagonistA can .  ProtagonistA's friend said ,  I do n't believe ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA said ,  Watch this .  ProtagonistA picked up a rock and skipped it across the water . It made a beautiful sound as it hit the water . ProtagonistA's friend said ,  That was amazing ! I did n't know ProtagonistA could do that .  ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA told you ProtagonistA could .  
ProtagonistA was sitting in the seat of a beach cruiser , ProtagonistA's tail wagging . ProtagonistA was enjoying the wind in ProtagonistA's fur and the sun on ProtagonistA's face . Suddenly , ProtagonistA saw a rabbit running across the sand . ProtagonistA jumped out of the seat and took off after the rabbit . ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life until ProtagonistA ran into a tree and knocked ProtagonistA out . 
ProtagonistB was out of cupcakes . ProtagonistA was beginning to get quite worn out , though ProtagonistA had n't intended for ProtagonistA's obsession to get out of control . It had started innocently enough . A few cupcakes here and there . But then it had spiraled . ProtagonistB was always getting cupcakes , and ProtagonistA always wanted one . ProtagonistA began to follow ProtagonistB around , always begging for just one more . Finally , ProtagonistB had had enough . ProtagonistB confronted ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to get ProtagonistA's life together . ProtagonistA was heartbroken . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been taking advantage of ProtagonistB's kindness and that ProtagonistA needed to get help . With the help of ProtagonistA's friends , ProtagonistA was able to get ProtagonistA's cupcake obsession under control . ProtagonistA apologized to ProtagonistB and they were able to remain friends . 
ProtagonistA sat down on the edge of the bank , crossed ProtagonistA's legs , and stared out at the sea beyond the bank . ProtagonistA had always loved the ocean , ever since ProtagonistA was a little boy . Even now , as an old man , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel the same sense of wonder and awe that ProtagonistA had felt all those years ago . ProtagonistA watched as the waves crashed against the shore , the sun glinting off the water . ProtagonistA breathed in the salty air and felt the wind blowing through ProtagonistA's hair . It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was glad to be alive to see it . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB , standing a few feet away . ProtagonistB was smiling , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA for a while . It 's time to go , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA 'm ready when ProtagonistB are . ProtagonistA nodded and got to ProtagonistA's feet . ProtagonistA took one last look at the ocean , then turned and walked back to ProtagonistA's car with ProtagonistB . It was time to go home . 
ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes . ProtagonistA was a bit tired , having made it three hours from here and had no idea how much longer that would last . ProtagonistA had been driving for two days straight and was starting to feel it . ProtagonistA had been on the road for a week , ever since ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's home in Maine . ProtagonistA was headed to California , to start a new life . ProtagonistA had always wanted to live there and now ProtagonistA finally had the chance . ProtagonistA had been making good time , but now ProtagonistA was starting to run out of gas . ProtagonistA had been hoping to make it to the next town , but it did n't look like that was going to happen . ProtagonistA pulled over to the side of the road and got out ProtagonistA's map . ProtagonistA figured ProtagonistA was about a day 's drive from the nearest town . ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA could make it that far , but ProtagonistA had to try . ProtagonistA got back in ProtagonistA's car and started driving . ProtagonistA was getting low on gas , but ProtagonistA kept going . ProtagonistA did n't want to stop and ProtagonistA did n't want to turn back . ProtagonistA had come too far to give up now . ProtagonistA drove for another hour before ProtagonistA finally ran out of gas . ProtagonistA coasted to a stop and just sat there for a moment , trying to figure out what to do . ProtagonistA got out of the car and started walking . ProtagonistA had no idea how far it was to the nearest town , but ProtagonistA was determined to make it . ProtagonistA walked for hours , but ProtagonistA never saw a town . ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA was going in circles . ProtagonistA was getting tired and hungry and ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA sat down to rest for a moment and ProtagonistA must have dozed off , because the next thing ProtagonistA knew , it was morning . ProtagonistA got up and kept walking . ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , but ProtagonistA was no closer to a town . ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA was never going to make it . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw a sign for the town ProtagonistA was looking for . ProtagonistA could n't believe it . ProtagonistA had made it . ProtagonistA walked into town and got something to eat . ProtagonistA was tired , but ProtagonistA was happy . ProtagonistA had made it to ProtagonistA's new home . 
ProtagonistA was born six months ago , and ProtagonistA was already sitting on a train headed for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA expected to find an elderly , dainty man sitting beside ProtagonistA , but instead ProtagonistA found a large , hairy man who was taking up most of the seat . The man was snoring loudly and drooling on the armrest . ProtagonistA was disgusted and tried to move to the other side of the train , but the man 's body was taking up so much space that ProtagonistA could n't squeeze past . ProtagonistA sat there for the rest of the ride , trying not to touch the man or breathe in his stench . ProtagonistA was relieved when the train finally arrived at the ProtagonistB station . ProtagonistA quickly got up and rushed off the train , glad to be away from the disgusting man . 
ProtagonistA , dressed in the highest style , sat down in the low dining - room of ProtagonistA's house on the bank of the Thames . ProtagonistA had just returned from a successful business trip to New York and was in a celebratory mood . ProtagonistA ordered the finest wine and the most expensive meal on the menu . As ProtagonistA waited for ProtagonistA's food , ProtagonistA looked out the window at the river flowing by . ProtagonistA was content and happy . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a loud splash . ProtagonistA got up to see what it was and saw ProtagonistB struggling in the water . Without thinking , ProtagonistA ran outside and jumped in . ProtagonistA was a strong swimmer and quickly reached ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA pulled ProtagonistB to safety and performed CPR until ProtagonistB revived . ProtagonistA was a hero . ProtagonistA had saved a life . And ProtagonistA was soaked . But ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA was just glad ProtagonistA was able to help . 
ProtagonistA sat down on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked down at the blank gray blue horizon . ProtagonistA had been walking for days , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and ProtagonistA's stomach was empty . ProtagonistA had been following a trail of bread crumbs , but they had long since been eaten by birds . ProtagonistA was n't sure where ProtagonistA was or where ProtagonistA was going . ProtagonistA only knew that ProtagonistA had to keep moving . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance . It sounded like someone was crying . ProtagonistA got up and started walking towards the sound . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB huddled on the ground . ProtagonistB was a little girl , and ProtagonistB was crying hysterically . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA did n't want to scare ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did n't want to leave ProtagonistB alone either . Finally , ProtagonistA decided to speak to ProtagonistB . Hello there ,  ProtagonistA said softly .  What 's wrong?The girl looked up at ProtagonistA with tear - stained cheeks .  ProtagonistB 'm lost ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 've been walking for days and ProtagonistB ca n't find ProtagonistB's way home . ProtagonistA's heart went out to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew how ProtagonistB felt . ProtagonistA had been in the same situation not too long ago . Don't worry ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'll help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's way home . ProtagonistA's name is ProtagonistA , by the way . ProtagonistB smiled through ProtagonistB's tears and introduced ProtagonistB . Then the two of them set off on the long journey home . 
ProtagonistA was a horse , and ProtagonistA was very proud of the fact that ProtagonistA had once saved the life of ProtagonistB . It had been a dark and stormy night , and ProtagonistB had been out riding when ProtagonistB's horse had been struck by lightning and killed . ProtagonistB had been thrown from the horse and was lying unconscious in the mud . ProtagonistA had seen what had happened and had galloped over to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had nudged ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's nose and whinnied loudly , until ProtagonistB had finally regained consciousness . ProtagonistB had been so grateful that ProtagonistB had made ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's personal horse and had given ProtagonistA a stable in the palace . Now , ProtagonistA was getting old , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would soon be retired . ProtagonistA was happy to have had such a long and eventful life , and ProtagonistA loved spending ProtagonistA's days in the stable , talking to the other horses about all the things ProtagonistA had seen and done . 
ProtagonistB was always telling ProtagonistA to hurry up .  Come on , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB would say .  We do n't have all day .  ProtagonistA hated it when ProtagonistB rushed ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistB would just let ProtagonistA take ProtagonistA's time . One day , ProtagonistA decided to take ProtagonistB's advice and hurry up . ProtagonistA rushed through ProtagonistA's breakfast and ran out the door . ProtagonistA did n't even say goodbye to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA just wanted to get to school and get it over with . But when ProtagonistA got to school , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's backpack at home . ProtagonistA had to go all the way back home to get it . ProtagonistA was so embarrassed . When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistB was waiting for ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to hurry up ,  ProtagonistB said .  Now ProtagonistA 're going to be late for school .  ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA had just listened to ProtagonistB in the first place . 
Dave Sparkle was out of cupcakes . Pinkie must have gone to the royal court . ProtagonistA was advancing towards the brides , wearing a pointed black frock , a black skirt even shorter than ProtagonistA's hips , and heels that reached just below ProtagonistA's knees . They wore flowing white dresses , or rather , they wore dresses like they were made of paper . All those years of stick - figure cartoon ponies that had been created by the Evil Weasels had all been wiped out , and now there was nothing but the images of ponies hoofing around a campfire . None of them , that is , when ProtagonistA had the chance to show them . 
ProtagonistA was always a good listener . ProtagonistA never interrupted when ProtagonistB was talking , and ProtagonistA always had a kind word to say . That 's why ProtagonistB always felt comfortable confiding in ProtagonistA . So when ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's concerns about their relationship , ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistA would listen attentively and give ProtagonistB's wise counsel . It 's all right , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said comfortingly .  ProtagonistA 'm always here for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB can always come to ProtagonistA with whatever is on ProtagonistB's mind . ProtagonistB was relieved to hear ProtagonistA say that , and ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB could always count on ProtagonistA to be ProtagonistB's sounding board . Thankful for ProtagonistA's understanding , ProtagonistB hugged ProtagonistA tightly . 
ProtagonistA was perched on the edge of a high bank , snapping the last few pennies from ProtagonistA's neck when ProtagonistA heard the call of an emergency . ProtagonistA had been out of work for weeks and was down to ProtagonistA's last few dollars . ProtagonistA had been hoping to find a job today , but so far , no luck . ProtagonistA was about to give up and go home when ProtagonistA heard the call . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't ignore it . ProtagonistA had to help . ProtagonistA scrambled down the bank and ran towards the sound . ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB in the water , struggling to stay afloat . ProtagonistA did n't hesitate . ProtagonistA jumped in and pulled ProtagonistB to safety . ProtagonistA had just saved a life . 
ProtagonistA had taken to riding into ProtagonistA's house on ProtagonistA's pink saddle hoof , noting the rows of fifth - story windows that led from ProtagonistA's backyard down into the city . It was a short ride , but it always made ProtagonistA feel better to be up high , looking down at the hustle and bustle below . One day , as ProtagonistA was trotting along , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling to ProtagonistA from one of the windows . Bob ! ProtagonistA ! Come over here!It was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was always friendly , and ProtagonistA had always liked ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA steered his hoof over to ProtagonistB's window and stopped . Hello , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  What can ProtagonistA do for you?Oh , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB 'm so glad ProtagonistA 're here . ProtagonistB 've been watching ProtagonistA ride around on ProtagonistA's hoof , and ProtagonistB was wondering if ProtagonistA could help ProtagonistB with something . Of course ,  ProtagonistA said .  What do ProtagonistB need?Well ,  ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB 'm moving next week , and ProtagonistB was wondering if ProtagonistA could help ProtagonistB carry ProtagonistB's things down to the street . ProtagonistB ca n't do it all by ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB's son is too busy to help ProtagonistB . Of course ProtagonistA 'll help ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  Just tell ProtagonistA when ProtagonistB 're ready , and ProtagonistA 'll be there . A few days later , ProtagonistA was back at ProtagonistB's window , helping ProtagonistB to carry ProtagonistB's things down to the street . It was a lot of work , but ProtagonistA did n't mind . ProtagonistA was happy to help ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would appreciate it . When they were finished , ProtagonistB turned to ProtagonistA and said ,  Thank ProtagonistA so much , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB do n't know what ProtagonistB would have done without ProtagonistA . It was no problem ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm happy to help . And with that , ProtagonistA trotted off , back to ProtagonistA's house , feeling good about ProtagonistA and the good deed ProtagonistA had done . 
There was ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always friendly and would always go out of ProtagonistA's way to help the customers . One day , ProtagonistA was helping ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was getting frustrated and was about to leave when ProtagonistA found the item for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was so grateful and thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help . 
Tilting ProtagonistA back , ProtagonistA looked up at the stars above . ProtagonistA felt a sense of wonder and peace looking at the infinite number of stars . It was a beautiful night and ProtagonistA felt grateful to be alive . 
ProtagonistA was sketching a town in the snow , when ProtagonistA turned to see the stars shining brightly in the evening sky . ProtagonistA was so captivated by their beauty that ProtagonistA forgot to continue ProtagonistA's sketch . Instead , ProtagonistA just sat there and stared at the stars until it was time to go home . 
ProtagonistA sighed as ProtagonistA watched her friends ride into the forest . ProtagonistA had wanted to go with them , but ProtagonistA's horse was lame and ProtagonistA could n't risk injuring it further . ProtagonistA knew the forest was dangerous , but ProtagonistA's friends were strong and capable riders . They would be fine . ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's horse around and headed back to the stables . ProtagonistA would have to find something else to do today . Maybe ProtagonistA would go into town and see if there was anything happening there . As ProtagonistA rode into town , ProtagonistA saw a group of men gathered around something . ProtagonistA rode closer to see what was going on . It looked like they were gambling . ProtagonistA did n't have any money to gamble with , but ProtagonistA watched for a while anyway . After a while , ProtagonistA got bored and decided to head home . As ProtagonistA rode out of town , ProtagonistA saw the men from the gambling ring . They were riding into the forest . ProtagonistA sighed . ProtagonistA should have known better than to let ProtagonistA's friends ride into the forest without ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's horse around and rode as fast as ProtagonistA could back to the stables . ProtagonistA would have to go after them . ProtagonistA just hoped ProtagonistA was n't too late . 
ProtagonistA stepped carefully down the steps of ProtagonistA's trailer , ProtagonistA's eyes resting on the blackened metal . It had been a long time since ProtagonistA 'd been out here , and everything looked different . The last time ProtagonistA 'd been here was with ProtagonistB , before ProtagonistB 'd passed away . Now , ProtagonistA was alone . ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way to the edge of the property , where the metal fence was . ProtagonistA leaned against it , looking out at the view . It was beautiful , in a way . The sun was setting , and the sky was a deep red . ProtagonistA could see the city in the distance , and it looked so different from up here . ProtagonistA sighed , wondering what ProtagonistA was doing here . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't go back to the city . ProtagonistA did n't have anything there anymore . But ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do out here , either . ProtagonistA supposed ProtagonistA would just have to take it one day at a time . 
ProtagonistA stood in the dim light of the distance , ProtagonistA's face downcast and blue eyes fixed on the ground below . ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and blistered . ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was or where ProtagonistA was going . ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's home in the city days ago , after a huge argument with ProtagonistA's parents . ProtagonistA had been wandering aimlessly ever since . ProtagonistA was tired and hungry , and ProtagonistA's stomach was growling . ProtagonistA had no money and no food . ProtagonistA had been sleeping in parks and on benches , and ProtagonistA was dirty and disheveled . ProtagonistA had thought about going back home , but ProtagonistA was too proud and stubborn . ProtagonistA did n't want to admit that ProtagonistA had made a mistake . ProtagonistA continued to walk , not knowing where to go or what to do . ProtagonistA felt lost and alone . As the sun began to set , ProtagonistA saw a sign for a small town up ahead . ProtagonistA decided to go there and see if ProtagonistA could find a place to stay for the night . As ProtagonistA entered the town , ProtagonistA was surprised to see that it was very quaint and charming . ProtagonistA walked down the main street , looking for a place to stay . ProtagonistA saw a sign for a bed and breakfast , and ProtagonistA decided to go there . ProtagonistA knocked on the door , and ProtagonistB answered . ProtagonistA explained ProtagonistA's situation , and ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA in . ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a warm meal and a comfortable bed . ProtagonistA was so grateful . The next morning , ProtagonistA woke up refreshed and ready to start a new day . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's kindness , and ProtagonistA set off down the road , feeling hopeful for the first time in days . 
ProtagonistA , took a moment to admire the view . The colors were so vibrant and the sky so clear . ProtagonistA felt alive and free . It was a beautiful day . 
ProtagonistA leaned against the tree , ProtagonistA's hooves strumming happily . ProtagonistA was a horse , and ProtagonistA loved life . ProtagonistA loved the smell of the fresh , green grass , and the feel of the warm sun on ProtagonistA's back . ProtagonistA was happy just to be alive . 
ProtagonistA stood before ProtagonistA's desk , looking at the empty chair across from ProtagonistA . It had been a long time since ProtagonistA had last seen ProtagonistB . They had been through a lot together , and ProtagonistA had always considered ProtagonistB a brother . But now , things were different . ProtagonistA had changed . ProtagonistA was no longer the same person ProtagonistA had been when they first met . ProtagonistA had been through too much , and seen too much . The things ProtagonistA had once considered important no longer mattered to ProtagonistA . All that mattered now was survival . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would never understand what ProtagonistA had become . But that was okay . ProtagonistA did n't need anyone 's understanding . All ProtagonistA needed was to be left alone . ProtagonistA turned away from the empty chair and sat down at ProtagonistA's desk . There was work to be done . 
ProtagonistA was wiping the sweat away from ProtagonistA's forehead when ProtagonistA saw the light . ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting tired . ProtagonistA had been following the light since ProtagonistA saw it in the distance , and ProtagonistA was hoping it would lead ProtagonistA to somewhere safe . ProtagonistA was getting worried that it was just a trick of the light , and ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw it again . ProtagonistA started to walk towards it , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was a campfire . ProtagonistA was so relieved that ProtagonistA almost cried . ProtagonistA walked into the camp and saw that there were people there . They were all asleep , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA was just happy to be safe . 
ProtagonistA blasted ProtagonistA's horn into the air and dropped down to the floor , hovering there , impossible . ProtagonistA had been practicing this move for weeks and finally perfected it . ProtagonistA's friends were always impressed with ProtagonistA's skills , but this time ProtagonistA outdid ProtagonistA . 
I am not sure whether it was the pegasus or the dragon 's doggone kindness that wrapped their pinkie tracings around ProtagonistA's head as ProtagonistA walked through the door . But , either way , it was a welcome sight . After all , ProtagonistA had been walking through that door for years , and never once had ProtagonistA been greeted with anything but a cold , hard stare . But today , there was something different in the air . ProtagonistA could feel it the moment ProtagonistA stepped foot into the dragon 's lair . There was a warmth there that ProtagonistA had never felt before , and it was emanating from the dragon itself . It was as if the creature had finally realized that ProtagonistA was not a threat , but a friend . And so , ProtagonistA walked slowly towards the dragon , pinkie tracings still wrapped around ProtagonistA's head , and extended a hand in friendship . The dragon , in turn , extended its own hand , and the two creatures touched pinkies , sealing their newfound friendship . 
ProtagonistA leaned against the trees , ProtagonistA's head resting lightly on the large , fat trunk . ProtagonistA was tired from a long day of work and just wanted to rest for a few minutes . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let out a deep breath . It was peaceful here in the woods . ProtagonistA could hear the birds singing and the leaves rustling in the breeze . It was just what ProtagonistA needed . 
ProtagonistA stroked the buttons of ProtagonistA's blouse , feeling the softness beneath ProtagonistA's skin . ProtagonistA loved the way the fabric felt against ProtagonistA's fingertips and the way it clung to ProtagonistA's body . ProtagonistA could feel the eyes of the other women in the room on ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew they were jealous of ProtagonistA's beautiful blouse . ProtagonistA smiled to ProtagonistA and continued to stroke the buttons , feeling the softness of the fabric . 
ProtagonistB eyed ProtagonistA , but had no intention of touching ProtagonistA . It was clear that ProtagonistA was not interested in anything ProtagonistB had to offer , and ProtagonistB was not about to force ProtagonistB on someone who did n't want ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB would just have to find someone else to spend ProtagonistB's time with . 
ProtagonistA sat on the bank , ProtagonistA's hooves carefully below the surface of the water , ProtagonistA's flat chest and shy muzzle showing the attention of the natural beauty . The sun was setting and the sky was ablaze with colors . ProtagonistA watched as the colors danced across the water and ProtagonistA felt at peace . ProtagonistA knew that this was a special place and ProtagonistA was lucky to have found it . 
ProtagonistA was a horse who loved to sit on the ground . ProtagonistA would sit for hours , ProtagonistA's hooves resting in front of ProtagonistA , and just enjoy the world around ProtagonistA . One day , while ProtagonistA was sitting , a rabbit ran by . The rabbit looked terrified and ProtagonistA wondered what was going on . Suddenly , a fox came running after the rabbit . The fox was clearly trying to catch the rabbit for dinner . The rabbit ran for its life and the fox was right behind it . ProtagonistA wanted to help the rabbit , but ProtagonistA did n't know how . Then ProtagonistA had an idea . ProtagonistA started to stomp ProtagonistA's hooves on the ground as hard as ProtagonistA could . The noise scared the fox and it ran away . The rabbit was safe . ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA could help . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's saddle and watched the sun rise over the high hills . ProtagonistA was a simple man , and ProtagonistA loved simple things . ProtagonistA loved the smell of the fresh air in the morning , and ProtagonistA loved the sound of the birds singing . ProtagonistA loved the feel of the saddle beneath ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA loved the way the horse 's hooves made a soft thudding sound on the ground . ProtagonistA was content just to sit there and watch the world wake up around ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA sat down on the golden throne in ProtagonistA's tower , and ProtagonistA looked out at the sea of stars that stretched before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had always loved the stars , and ProtagonistA used to dream of being one of them . Now , ProtagonistA was the ruler of the galaxy , and ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA could ever want . But somehow , looking at the stars made ProtagonistA feel lonely . ProtagonistA missed the days when ProtagonistA would just sit and dream about them . 
ProtagonistA , sat at ProtagonistB's desk , ProtagonistA's hooves resting on the very smooth surface of the paper . ProtagonistA had been a gift to ProtagonistB from ProtagonistB's daughter , and ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA dearly . ProtagonistA was always so well - behaved , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB just as much . Today , ProtagonistB was working on a very important project and ProtagonistB needed to concentrate . However , try as ProtagonistB might , ProtagonistB could n't help but notice ProtagonistA's cute little face peeking over the edge of the desk . ProtagonistB smiled and reached over to give ProtagonistA a pat on the head . I'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB really need to focus on this right now . Why do n't ProtagonistA go and play with ProtagonistA's toys for a little while?Amber seemed to understand , and ProtagonistA trotted off to the other room . ProtagonistB breathed a sigh of relief and went back to work . 
ProtagonistA stood in the doorway of the bank , and the crystal ball was spinning in ProtagonistA's fingers . ProtagonistA had been planning this heist for months , and everything was finally falling into place . ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB pacing back and forth in the lobby , and the tellers busy at their stations . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to act fast . ProtagonistA walked into the bank and approached ProtagonistB . Pretending to trip , ProtagonistA dropped the crystal ball . As ProtagonistB bent down to help ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA grabbed ProtagonistA's gun and pointed it at ProtagonistB .  This is a robbery ,  ProtagonistA yelled . The tellers immediately put their hands up , and ProtagonistA ordered them to fill ProtagonistA's backpack with cash . ProtagonistA could hear the sirens in the distance , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA had gotten away with the perfect crime . 
ProtagonistA cracked open ProtagonistA's newspaper , nudged the option beneath the headline Today , ProtagonistA was going to write a story about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a man who had it all - a successful career , a beautiful wife , and two healthy children . But despite all of ProtagonistB's blessings , ProtagonistB was unhappy . ProtagonistB was always working , and ProtagonistB never had time for ProtagonistB's family . ProtagonistB's wife was always nagging ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB's children were always getting into trouble . One day , ProtagonistB had had enough . ProtagonistB packed up ProtagonistB's things and left ProtagonistB's family behind . ProtagonistB moved to a small town and started a new life . ProtagonistB was finally happy . ProtagonistB had all the time in the world for ProtagonistB's hobbies and ProtagonistB's new friends . ProtagonistB's family was still important to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB was content without them . 
ProtagonistA whistled an old , hoof - tired tune as ProtagonistA peered around the edge of ProtagonistA's cottage at the vast , arid expanse beyond the great umbrella of emerald leaves that crowned the ceiling . The sun was setting , casting a red glow over the land , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA should be getting back inside before the night creatures came out . But ProtagonistA could n't help but stare at the beauty of the land before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had been living in this cottage for years , and it never ceased to amaze ProtagonistA how different the world looked from up here . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA turned around , heart pounding , but there was nothing there . Just the wind , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that someone was watching ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA quickly went back inside and locked the door . 
ProtagonistA sat up on the front step of the house with ProtagonistA's eyes closed . ProtagonistA had been sitting there for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had arrived home from work . ProtagonistA was too tired to go inside , too tired to even move . ProtagonistA just wanted to sit there and relax , and maybe doze off for a little while . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise . It sounded like someone was coming up the walk . ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw ProtagonistB approaching . As ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was a woman . ProtagonistB was carrying a large bag , and ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was in a hurry . ProtagonistB came up to ProtagonistA and said ,  ProtagonistB 'm sorry to bother ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB 'm looking for a place to stay . Do ProtagonistA know of any motels or hotels in the area?Bob shook ProtagonistA's head .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , but ProtagonistA do n't . ProtagonistA just moved here ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB sighed .  ProtagonistB see . Well , thank ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's time . ProtagonistB turned to leave , but ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB .  Wait!The woman turned back .  Yes?You can stay here ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA have a spare bedroom , and ProtagonistB 're welcome to use it . The woman 's face lit up .  Thank ProtagonistA so much ! ProtagonistA 're a lifesaver . ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's feet and led ProtagonistB into the house . ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB to the spare bedroom , and ProtagonistB gratefully accepted ProtagonistA's offer . ProtagonistA did n't know what had come over ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had been able to help ProtagonistB . It felt good to know that ProtagonistA had made a difference in someone 's life . 
ProtagonistA had been driving home from the hospital after a terrible accident in which ProtagonistA had been struck by a bus . It was a miracle that ProtagonistA had survived , but ProtagonistA was still in a great deal of pain . As ProtagonistA drove , ProtagonistA saw a dark figure in the road ahead of ProtagonistA . At first , ProtagonistA thought it was a trick of the light , but as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that it was a person . ProtagonistA slammed on the brakes , but it was too late . ProtagonistA hit the figure , and it flew through the air , landing in a ditch by the side of the road . ProtagonistA got out of ProtagonistA's car to see if the person was all right , but there was no sign of life . ProtagonistA had killed someone . 
ProtagonistA had been working at the desk for a few weeks now , and ProtagonistA had yet to find a way to get ProtagonistA's notebook out of the trunk behind the desk . ProtagonistA knew it was there , ProtagonistA just could n't seem to find a way to get to it . The first thing ProtagonistA had to do was find a way to get ProtagonistA's notebook out of the trunk behind the desk . ProtagonistA tried a few different things , but none of them seemed to work . Finally , ProtagonistA just decided to go for it and see what happened . ProtagonistA reached into the trunk and grabbed ProtagonistA's notebook . ProtagonistA was relieved to see that it was still there . Now all ProtagonistA had to do was find a way to get it out of the trunk and into ProtagonistA's hands . 
ProtagonistA was a hasty and groping traveller , always carrying some form of burdens on ProtagonistA's back , but the Seven Seas of Latron on the banks of the river had always been a friendlier place . ProtagonistA had first come here years ago , when ProtagonistA was just a boy , and the river had always been a place of solace for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA would come here to think , to be alone with ProtagonistA's thoughts , and to escape the hustle and bustle of the city . But now , as ProtagonistA approached the river , ProtagonistA could see that something was wrong . The water was murky and dark , and there was a strange smell in the air . ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that the banks of the river were covered in garbage . Plastic bags , bottles , and other trash littered the once beautiful landscape . ProtagonistA was heartbroken . This had been ProtagonistA's refuge , ProtagonistA's safe place , and now it was ruined . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA stood there for a moment , staring at the river in disbelief , before turning and walking away . ProtagonistA would never come back here again . 
ProtagonistA was going through ProtagonistA's old keepsakes and came across a little book . ProtagonistA picked it up and examined it .  Why are ProtagonistA going through these keepsakes ?  ProtagonistA said to ProtagonistA .  Is there something ProtagonistA 're looking for ?  ProtagonistA flipped through the pages of the book and came across a picture of ProtagonistA as a foal . ProtagonistA smiled at the memory and put the book down . ProtagonistA continued to go through ProtagonistA's keepsakes , but ProtagonistA could n't help but wonder why ProtagonistA was going through them . 
ProtagonistA had been through so much , so many times , that ProtagonistA 'd reached the point where ProtagonistA 'd stopped caring what happened to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 'd been through heartbreak , loss , and betrayal , and ProtagonistA was tired of it all . ProtagonistA was tired of feeling like ProtagonistA was the only one who cared about anything . ProtagonistA was done with caring . So , when ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistA did n't even shed a tear . ProtagonistA just shrugged it off and went on with ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistB was gone . ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistB again . ProtagonistA was done caring . And when ProtagonistC left ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA did n't even try to stop ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA just let ProtagonistC go and went on with ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistC was gone . ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistC again . ProtagonistA was done caring . ProtagonistA had reached the point where nothing mattered to ProtagonistA anymore . ProtagonistA was just going through the motions of life , without any real purpose or meaning . ProtagonistA was just existing , not living . And ProtagonistA was okay with that . 
ProtagonistA stepped out of the greenhouse , whirled , and threw ProtagonistA's head back . ProtagonistA was met with a gust of cold wind that made ProtagonistA shiver . ProtagonistA had forgotten ProtagonistA's coat inside and now ProtagonistA regretted it . ProtagonistA turned back to the greenhouse to go get it when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB in the distance . ProtagonistB was a woman , and ProtagonistB was coming towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA had a feeling ProtagonistA was going to find out . 
ProtagonistA had been waiting for the moment , talking to ProtagonistA's grandfather , when it would happen : here were ProtagonistA's feet , well - nigh barefoot , with their unkempt , patchy hair , and ProtagonistA's hands folded under the lids , as if ProtagonistA had been carrying them for some months , so that ProtagonistA's hands should have a little more room , and ProtagonistA's fingers a little less clumsy , than when ProtagonistA was twelve . And so it happened that one day , when ProtagonistA was out walking with ProtagonistA's grandfather , ProtagonistA saw a pair of shoes lying in the grass . ProtagonistA picked them up and put them on ProtagonistA's feet , and they fit perfectly . ProtagonistA knew that this was the moment ProtagonistA had been waiting for . 
I remember ProtagonistA ; and I remember , too , that ProtagonistA was born a little after the year 1852 , that ProtagonistA was of the small family , of the same kind as myself , though no one of that family should have been more than ten years my senior ; and that ProtagonistB , had no money , which only bordered on the imaginary , while ProtagonistB had everything else desired , and that everything ProtagonistB asked for was granted ProtagonistB without any regard to the wants of others . ProtagonistA and I were great friends , though we were not equals . I never had anything that ProtagonistA wanted , and ProtagonistA always had everything that I wanted ; but that never made any difference between us . 
ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's wings for more than a year when ProtagonistA discovered what ProtagonistB , had been planning for a good long while . ProtagonistB had been secretly stockpiling weapons and planning to overthrow ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA was horrified and went to ProtagonistC to warn ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC did n't believe ProtagonistA at first , but ProtagonistA was able to convince ProtagonistC to check ProtagonistB's quarters . Sure enough , there were weapons hidden everywhere . ProtagonistC had ProtagonistB arrested and ProtagonistB was sentenced to death . ProtagonistA was hailed as a hero and given a place of honor in the Pride . 
ProtagonistA had always dreamed of sailing to the new world . ProtagonistA had heard tales of the vast riches that could be found there , and ProtagonistA was determined to find ProtagonistA's fortune . When ProtagonistA finally set sail on ProtagonistA's voyage , ProtagonistA was filled with excitement and anticipation . The journey was long and difficult , but ProtagonistA persevered . Finally , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's crew arrived in the new world . They were met with hostile natives and treacherous conditions , but ProtagonistA persevered . ProtagonistA was determined to find the treasure ProtagonistA had been dreaming of . After months of searching , ProtagonistA finally struck gold . ProtagonistA had found more wealth than ProtagonistA could have ever imagined . ProtagonistA was able to return to ProtagonistA's home country a rich man , and ProtagonistA lived happily ever after . 
Bob should have known better . said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA stood on the edge of the granite threshold , as a matter of course , he're here on trial , in the middle of a war , and he're not winning . he're not going to be able to keep it up all night . 
ProtagonistA peered into ProtagonistA's book , half - listening , half - expecting ProtagonistB to speak . ProtagonistA had been sitting in the same spot for hours , lost in the world of ProtagonistA's book . But ProtagonistB's voice always seemed to find ProtagonistA , no matter how deep ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's thoughts . What are ProtagonistA reading ?  ProtagonistB asked , sitting down next to ProtagonistA . The Chronicles of Narnia ,  ProtagonistA replied , not taking ProtagonistA's eyes off the page .  again ?  ProtagonistB sighed .  ProtagonistA 've read that series like , five times . ProtagonistA know ,  ProtagonistA said .  But ProtagonistA ca n't help it . ProtagonistA love it . I do n't understand what ProtagonistA see in those books ,  ProtagonistB said .  They 're just stories . They're more than that ,  ProtagonistA said .  They 're magical . And with that , ProtagonistA was pulled back into the world of ProtagonistA's book , forgetting all about ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA sat down and just watched as ProtagonistB squatted beside ProtagonistA and watched ProtagonistA draw ProtagonistA's bow and day out . ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's big brown eyes and ProtagonistA could see the admiration in them . ProtagonistA had always been the better hunter , but ProtagonistB had never given up trying to beat ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistB 'll get ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said . I do n't doubt it ,  ProtagonistA replied . They sat there in silence for a while , just enjoying each other 's company . It was rare that they got to spend time together like this , with ProtagonistB always being busy with the farm and ProtagonistA always being out hunting . So , what did ProtagonistA get today ?  ProtagonistB asked . A deer ,  ProtagonistA replied .  A big one too . ProtagonistA 'm going to have enough meat to last ProtagonistA the winter . That 's great ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA 'm sure dad will be happy to hear that . They sat there for a while longer before ProtagonistB stood up . I should get back to the farm ,  ProtagonistB said .  Thanks for letting ProtagonistB watch ProtagonistA hunt . Thanks for watching ,  ProtagonistA replied . ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB's walk away , then went back to ProtagonistA's hunting . 
ProtagonistA had waited all summer for ProtagonistA's chance . ProtagonistA had been watching the house next door , and ProtagonistA knew that the family was going on vacation . ProtagonistA had planned everything out perfectly . ProtagonistA would break into the house while they were gone , and ProtagonistA would finally have a place to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was careful as ProtagonistA broke into the house . ProtagonistA did n't want to leave any evidence that ProtagonistA had been there . ProtagonistA went through the house , room by room , until ProtagonistA found what ProtagonistA was looking for . The family 's bedroom . ProtagonistA went through their belongings , and ProtagonistA found a key . ProtagonistA smiled to ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA pocketed the key . Now that ProtagonistA had a key , ProtagonistA could come and go as ProtagonistA please . ProtagonistA would have a place to stay when ProtagonistA was in town , and ProtagonistA would n't have to worry about being caught . ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's new found treasure , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never be caught . 
ProtagonistA was walking home from ProtagonistA's last day of school when ProtagonistA was stopped by a reporter .  ProtagonistA , do ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA 'll be going back to school ?  the reporter asked .  No , ProtagonistA do n't think so ,  ProtagonistA replied .  ProtagonistA 'm going to get a job and start ProtagonistA's life .  The reporter thanked ProtagonistA for his time and went on his way . ProtagonistA continued walking home , thinking about ProtagonistA's future . ProtagonistA was excited to start ProtagonistA's new life and make ProtagonistA's own way in the world . 
ProtagonistA sat by ProtagonistA's window and hoped that the sun was n't up . ProtagonistA had been up all night , and ProtagonistA was exhausted . ProtagonistA wanted nothing more than to go to bed and sleep for a few hours . But ProtagonistA knew that if the sun was up , it would be time to start ProtagonistA's day . ProtagonistA would have to get up and go to work . ProtagonistA did n't want to go to work . ProtagonistA wanted to stay in bed and sleep . But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to go to work . ProtagonistA got up and got ready for ProtagonistA's day . 
ProtagonistA sat at ProtagonistA's desk and watched as ProtagonistB leaned ProtagonistB's head onto ProtagonistA's shoulder . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistB's body relax as ProtagonistB took a deep breath and closed ProtagonistB's eyes . It had been a long day for both of them and they were both exhausted . ProtagonistA's mind wandered as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB sleep . ProtagonistA thought about all of the things they had been through together . ProtagonistA remembered the time when they were both younger and ProtagonistB had gotten lost in the city . ProtagonistA had been so worried about ProtagonistB but ProtagonistB had always had a knack for finding ProtagonistB's way home . ProtagonistA also remembered the time when ProtagonistB had broken ProtagonistB's leg and ProtagonistA had to carry ProtagonistB's home . ProtagonistB had been so brave and had never complained . ProtagonistA felt grateful to have ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA wrapped ProtagonistA's arms around ProtagonistB and held ProtagonistB close . 
ProtagonistA was walking home from school when ProtagonistA saw a man walking towards ProtagonistA . The man had a knife in his hand and ProtagonistA could see the look in his eyes . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die .  Oh , f - f - fucks if I kill you now ,  thought ProtagonistA , wishing ProtagonistB had not forbidden ProtagonistA to leave . ProtagonistA tried to run , but the man was too fast . ProtagonistA felt the knife enter ProtagonistA's back and ProtagonistA fell to the ground . As ProtagonistA lay there dying , ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistB and how ProtagonistB had always told ProtagonistA to be careful . 
ProtagonistA's world was on fire , and ProtagonistA did not know it , but ProtagonistA knew it was the end . The flames were licking at ProtagonistA's feet and the heat was searing ProtagonistA's skin . ProtagonistA could hear the screams of the people around ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA could not see them . The only thing ProtagonistA could see was the fire . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get out , but ProtagonistA did n't know how . Then ProtagonistA saw the door . The door was ProtagonistA's only way out . ProtagonistA ran towards it , but the flames were too strong . They engulfed ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was gone . 
ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's home world of Equestria when ProtagonistA was eight years old . ProtagonistA had been on a quest to find a new world to call home . ProtagonistA had been searching for years , and ProtagonistA had finally found it . ProtagonistA had found a world that was perfect for ProtagonistA . It was a world where ProtagonistA could be ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't have to pretend to be something ProtagonistA was n't . ProtagonistA could be ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could be happy . 
ProtagonistA was lying on the floor of ProtagonistA's room , bending forward . ProtagonistA was trying to reach the remote that had fallen just out of ProtagonistA's reach . ProtagonistA could see it , just barely , but it might as well have been a mile away . ProtagonistA was just about to give up when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB coming down the hall . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was in for it if ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA like this . ProtagonistA had to think fast . 
Two days ago ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends had an idea : to set up a lemonade stand . They worked hard all morning , setting up the stand and making the lemonade . By lunchtime , they were ready for business . But no one came . Not even one person . They sat there all afternoon , waiting , but no one came . Finally , they gave up and went home . ProtagonistA was so disappointed . ProtagonistA had really wanted this to work . But maybe next time ProtagonistA 'll have more luck . 
ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistA's hoof out of ProtagonistB's eyes , but fished out a few strands of pony hair , like ProtagonistA always had . ProtagonistA was getting too old for this , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit nostalgic . After all , it was ProtagonistB's hair that ProtagonistA was holding in ProtagonistA's hoof . ProtagonistA remembered the first time ProtagonistA had held ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's hooves . ProtagonistB was so tiny and fragile . ProtagonistA was afraid ProtagonistA would break ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB was perfect . Over the years ProtagonistB had grown into a strong and beautiful young mare , and ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistB . Now , ProtagonistB was all grown up and did n't need ProtagonistA's help anymore . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to let ProtagonistB go , but it was hard . ProtagonistA was going to miss ProtagonistB so much . ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB one last hug and then turned to leave . As ProtagonistA walked away , ProtagonistA felt a tear run down ProtagonistA's cheek . 
ProtagonistA had been smoking for years , and ProtagonistA knew it was time to quit . ProtagonistA had tried before , but ProtagonistA always ended up going back to it . This time , ProtagonistA was determined to make it stick . ProtagonistA stopped smoking and looked up from the book ProtagonistA was reading . ProtagonistA was surprised to find that ProtagonistA did n't miss it as much as ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA would . In fact , ProtagonistA felt better than ProtagonistA had in a long time . ProtagonistA was able to breathe easier and ProtagonistA's cough had gone away . ProtagonistA was happy to have made the decision to quit and was proud of ProtagonistA for sticking to it . 
ProtagonistA had been sleeping soundly when ProtagonistA was suddenly awoken by a loud noise . ProtagonistA sat up in bed , heart racing , and looked around ProtagonistA's room . Everything was as it should be , but ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that something was wrong . ProtagonistA got out of bed and walked to ProtagonistA's window , peering out into the darkness . That 's when ProtagonistA saw it . A large , dark figure was standing in ProtagonistA's yard , looking up at ProtagonistA's window . ProtagonistA's heart sank as ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was being watched . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to act fast . ProtagonistA ran to ProtagonistA's door and locked it , then grabbed ProtagonistA's phone and called the police . ProtagonistA was shaking by the time they arrived , but ProtagonistA was relieved to see that the figure was gone . ProtagonistA did n't know what it was , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA never wanted to see it again . 
ProtagonistA had always wished ProtagonistA had been born in a different time and place . ProtagonistA was born in the early 1900s in a small town in the Midwest . ProtagonistA was the youngest of three children and ProtagonistA's family was not well off . ProtagonistA's father worked long hours at the local factory and ProtagonistA's mother stayed home to take care of the children . ProtagonistA's siblings were both older than ProtagonistA and often teased ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a shy child and ProtagonistA did n't have many friends . ProtagonistA was always daydreaming about what it would be like to live in a different time or place . ProtagonistA would imagine ProtagonistA as a knight in shining armor or a brave explorer . ProtagonistA even daydreamed about being born in a different time so ProtagonistA could have been born into a wealthy family . ProtagonistA's daydreams were ProtagonistA's escape from ProtagonistA's reality . 
ProtagonistA was a horse who lived on a farm . One day , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to help ProtagonistB with a job . ProtagonistA said yes , but ProtagonistA should have said no . The job was to pull a wagon full of hay . ProtagonistA was not strong enough to pull the wagon and ProtagonistA ended up getting stuck . ProtagonistB had to call for help to get ProtagonistA out . ProtagonistA was embarrassed and ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA had said no to the job . 
ProtagonistA had been very pondering how to spend the week before wearing ProtagonistA's crown . ProtagonistA had always wanted to be king , but ProtagonistA never imagined the responsibility that came with it . ProtagonistA had to make sure the kingdom was running smoothly and that everyone was happy . ProtagonistA also had to attend to ProtagonistA's royal duties , such as meeting with ambassadors and attending balls . It was a lot of work , but ProtagonistA loved it . ProtagonistA was happy to be able to help ProtagonistA's people and make them happy . 
ProtagonistA had never managed to get used to the idea that ProtagonistA had to be the only pony on the grounds or the ground in order to do anything without prompting . Even now , as ProtagonistA stood in the middle of the field , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit self - conscious . ProtagonistA knew that the other ponies were watching ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could feel their judgmental eyes on ProtagonistA . It was like they were all saying ,  What are ProtagonistA doing ? ProtagonistA 're the only one here . ProtagonistA tried to ignore the feeling and focus on what ProtagonistA was supposed to be doing . ProtagonistA had a job to do , and ProtagonistA was going to do it to the best of ProtagonistA's ability . ProtagonistA was the groundskeeper , and it was ProtagonistA's job to make sure that the grounds were kept up . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and got to work . ProtagonistA worked all day , and by the time ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistA was exhausted . But ProtagonistA felt good about what ProtagonistA had accomplished . ProtagonistA had done ProtagonistA's job well , and ProtagonistA had made the grounds look beautiful . ProtagonistA was proud of ProtagonistA . As ProtagonistA walked back to the barn , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit sad . ProtagonistA wished that ProtagonistA had someone to talk to , someone who would understand what ProtagonistA was going through . But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was the only one who felt that way . ProtagonistA was the only pony on the grounds , and ProtagonistA would always be alone . 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day . First , ProtagonistA woke up late and had to rush to get ready for ProtagonistA's day . Then , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had forgotten to put on ProtagonistA's shoes and had to go back to ProtagonistA's room to find them . When ProtagonistA finally made it downstairs , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's keys upstairs . So , ProtagonistA had to go back up to get them . By the time ProtagonistA made it out the door , ProtagonistA was already running late . ProtagonistA rushed to ProtagonistA's car , but when ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had locked ProtagonistA's keys in the house . ProtagonistA did n't have time to go back , so ProtagonistA had to call ProtagonistB . By the time ProtagonistB arrived , ProtagonistA was so frazzled , ProtagonistA forgot to pay ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA finally made it to work , but ProtagonistA's boss was not happy . ProtagonistA was given a stern talking to and told that if ProtagonistA did n't shape up , ProtagonistA would be fired . ProtagonistA's day just kept getting worse . ProtagonistA sat at ProtagonistA's desk , trying to concentrate on ProtagonistA's work , but ProtagonistA was so distracted , ProtagonistA could n't focus . ProtagonistA was so lost in thought , ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistA's co - worker come up to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA okay?Bob turned to see ProtagonistA's co - worker , Concerned .  ProtagonistA 'm fine ,  ProtagonistA lied . ProtagonistA do n't look fine . ProtagonistA look like ProtagonistA 're about to have a breakdown . I'm fine , really . But ProtagonistA was n't fine . ProtagonistA was about to lose ProtagonistA's job , ProtagonistA had no money to pay ProtagonistA's rent , and ProtagonistA was pretty sure ProtagonistA's girlfriend was about to break up with ProtagonistA . As ProtagonistA sat there , staring at ProtagonistA's computer screen , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's keys at home again . ProtagonistA was having the worst day ever . 
ProtagonistA had only once thought ProtagonistA would have a family , but now ProtagonistA believed that it was n't such a bad idea . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner and never really saw the appeal in having a wife and kids . But now , as ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistA's mid-30s , ProtagonistA started to feel like something was missing in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA began to think that maybe a family would be a good thing after all . So , ProtagonistA started the process of finding a wife . ProtagonistA went on dates , met some nice women , but none of them felt like the right fit . Then , one day , ProtagonistA met a woman named Sarah and everything clicked . They got married and soon had a baby girl . ProtagonistA could n't believe how happy ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA had finally found ProtagonistA's place in the world and ProtagonistA loved it . 
ProtagonistA was a small dog who loved to sit on ProtagonistA's hind legs and watch the sun set . ProtagonistA loved the large ship ProtagonistA was on and the way the sun set on the horizon . It was a beautiful sight . 
ProtagonistA had been having a great day . ProtagonistA had just finished up at work and was looking forward to a relaxing evening at home . But when ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's front door , ProtagonistA froze . There was ProtagonistB standing there , and ProtagonistB did n't look friendly . ProtagonistA was about to turn and run when ProtagonistB spoke .  Hello , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB 'm Chord the Pestilent . ProtagonistB 've come for ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA did n't want to go with ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was afraid of what would happen if ProtagonistA did n't . So ProtagonistA reluctantly followed ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA was led away . 
ProtagonistA had been working at the same company for ProtagonistA's entire adult life . ProtagonistA had started out as a lowly intern and worked ProtagonistA's way up to the position of CEO . ProtagonistA had been at the company for so long that ProtagonistA was starting to feel like a part of the furniture . ProtagonistA's friends and family would often joke with ProtagonistA , saying things like ,  There 's ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA ai n't going nowhere . But ProtagonistA was starting to feel like maybe it was time for a change . ProtagonistA had been thinking about retiring , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA was ready to give up the work that ProtagonistA loved . ProtagonistA had also been considering starting ProtagonistA's own company , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA had the energy or the resources to make it happen . One day , ProtagonistA came into work and found that ProtagonistA's office had been cleared out . All of ProtagonistA's personal belongings were gone , and there was a note on ProtagonistA's desk from the board of directors .

ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends had just finished taking a trip with Rarity when they decided to go on a camping trip . They packed their bags and headed out into the woods . After setting up camp , they went exploring . They found a stream and followed it until they came to a waterfall . They climbed up the rocks and took a dip in the pool at the top . After a long day of exploring , they headed back to camp and made a fire . They sat around the fire and told stories until they fell asleep . 
ProtagonistB did not ask ProtagonistA to do anything , said Applejack , and it was not a question ProtagonistA had thought about thoroughly , much less questioned . ProtagonistA just nodded ProtagonistA's head in response , not really sure what to say . It was true , ProtagonistB had never asked ProtagonistA to do anything , not even chores around the house . And yet , here ProtagonistA was , about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime . ProtagonistA had always wanted to travel the world , and now ProtagonistA finally had the chance . ProtagonistA was going to be a part of a travelling circus , and ProtagonistA could not be more excited . ProtagonistB had never asked ProtagonistA to do anything , but ProtagonistB had always supported ProtagonistA's dreams . And now , here ProtagonistA was , about to make them come true . ProtagonistA hugged ProtagonistB tightly , promising to come back and visit ProtagonistB as often as ProtagonistA could . Then , with a final wave , ProtagonistA was off , ready to start the adventure of a lifetime . 
When ProtagonistA woke up ProtagonistA was so excited ProtagonistA had n't even remembered what had happened the night before . ProtagonistA had been to the best party ever and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA had made some great new friends . ProtagonistA could n't wait to get back to the party and continue the fun . 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA could hear the water moving up from the lake . ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and blistered . ProtagonistA was thirsty , and the water looked so inviting . ProtagonistA walked to the edge of the lake and knelt down . ProtagonistA cupped ProtagonistA's hands and brought the water to ProtagonistA's lips . Just as ProtagonistA was about to drink , ProtagonistA heard a noise behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA turned around and saw a bear standing there , looking at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was so startled that ProtagonistA fell into the lake . The bear just watched ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA struggled to get out . When ProtagonistA finally made it to the shore , the bear was gone . ProtagonistA was soaked and shaking , but ProtagonistA was also very lucky to be alive . 
ProtagonistB had been so anxious for ProtagonistA to take ProtagonistA's first flight ProtagonistB had not known until that moment that the spell they were about to cast was for something else altogether . In ProtagonistB's haste to get ProtagonistA ready for ProtagonistA's big day , ProtagonistB had not realized that the other witches and wizards in the coven had other plans for ProtagonistA . As the spell began to take hold , ProtagonistB could see the look of terror in ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistB tried to fight against it , but it was too late . ProtagonistA was caught in the spell and would be used as a vessel for the dark forces that the coven worshipped . There was nothing ProtagonistB could do but watch as ProtagonistA was taken over by the evil spirits . ProtagonistB could only hope that someday ProtagonistA would be able to break free from their control and live a normal life . 
The island of New - Heaven was a place of great beauty and wonder . It was a land of cloud - capped mountains and silent islands . The people who lived there were always full of adventure . They were a safe haven for the most prosperous of ships . ProtagonistA was one of the lucky ones who was able to settle down in a secluded laird 's house . ProtagonistA was able to enjoy the beauty and peace of the island . 
ProtagonistB watched as ProtagonistA twisted and turned , ProtagonistA's hooves shifting as ProtagonistA tried to keep the position . The other horses in the field had long since given up and gone to graze , but ProtagonistA was determined to get the last bit of hay . Finally , ProtagonistA gave up and walked over to ProtagonistB , nuzzling ProtagonistA's nose in ProtagonistB's direction . ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a pat on the head , understanding ProtagonistA's determination . 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the rocking chair , ProtagonistB's hooves beneath ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA looked out at the sunset , thinking about all the things that had happened in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA 'd been through a lot , but ProtagonistA was still here , still fighting . ProtagonistA was grateful for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that as long as ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA could make it through anything . 
ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's wings for four years when ProtagonistA discovered that ProtagonistA was pregnant . It was a shock to ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA had always been careful to avoid getting pregnant . ProtagonistA did n't know how it had happened , but ProtagonistA was sure that it was a mistake . ProtagonistA did n't want to be a father , not yet . ProtagonistA was still too young and too irresponsible . ProtagonistA considered getting an abortion , but ProtagonistA could n't bring ProtagonistA to do it . ProtagonistA knew that it would be the right thing to do , but ProtagonistA just could n't bring ProtagonistA to do it . ProtagonistA did n't want to kill ProtagonistB . Instead , ProtagonistA decided to keep ProtagonistB and raise ProtagonistB on ProtagonistA's own . ProtagonistA knew it would be hard , but ProtagonistA was determined to do it . ProtagonistA would make it work , somehow . Four years later , ProtagonistB was born . ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB's ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was the light of ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB more than anything . ProtagonistA had been worried about being a father , but it turned out that ProtagonistA was a natural . ProtagonistA was patient and kind , and ProtagonistA always knew just what to do . ProtagonistA was everything that ProtagonistB needed , and ProtagonistB thrived under ProtagonistA's care . ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA had made the decision to keep ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had been wandering the land for years at that point , but it was the first time that ProtagonistA had really felt comfortable . ProtagonistA had finally found a place where ProtagonistA belonged . ProtagonistA had found a home . 
When ProtagonistA had reached the age of six years old , ProtagonistA began to change into the great doll , who ProtagonistA was always about . ProtagonistA would sit for hours in front of the mirror , combing ProtagonistA's hair and straightening ProtagonistA's clothes . ProtagonistB would often find ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's room , talking to ProtagonistA in a high - pitched voice .  ProtagonistA , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB would ask . But ProtagonistA would just smile and continue talking to the doll . One day , ProtagonistB came into ProtagonistA's room and found ProtagonistA sitting on the floor , surrounded by dolls . ProtagonistA was talking to them in a soft voice , as if ProtagonistA was telling them a secret . When ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was doing , ProtagonistA just smiled and said ,  ProtagonistA 'm becoming the great doll .  And from that day on , ProtagonistA was never the same again . 
ProtagonistA's hooves were shaking . ProtagonistA felt a little dizzy . When suddenly there was nothing but the light of ProtagonistA's tears and the summer air . ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had seen the fire in the distance . Now there was nothing left but ashes . ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA's family , everything was gone . ProtagonistA did n't know where to go or what to do . ProtagonistA just kept walking , until ProtagonistA could n't walk any further . ProtagonistA collapsed to the ground and wept . 
ProtagonistA was a simple farm horse who loved nothing more than a good roll in the mud and a carrot or two . ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life until one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . From the moment ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was in trouble . ProtagonistB was watching over ProtagonistA's hooves - a delicate balance , ProtagonistA reasoned , between worry and excitement - and Shining Armor was resting on ProtagonistA's shoulder . ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistA's heart racing as ProtagonistA looked into ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was in for the ride of ProtagonistA's life . 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's crew of misfits are just like us . They 're always getting into trouble and never seem to have enough money . But they 're also the most loyal friends we could ask for . They 're always there for a good time or a shoulder to cry on . We would n't trade them for anything in the world . 
ProtagonistA rested ProtagonistA's forelegs on ProtagonistA's knees , and let out a deep breath . It had been a long day , and ProtagonistA was tired . ProtagonistA had been out chasing rabbits all day , and had finally caught one . ProtagonistA was proud of ProtagonistA's catch , and was looking forward to a good meal . As ProtagonistA rested , ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA had been born in the wild , and had never known any other life . ProtagonistA was happy living in the forest , and did n't want for anything . ProtagonistA was content to chase rabbits all day , and sleep in the trees at night . ProtagonistA knew that some day ProtagonistA would die in the forest , but ProtagonistA was okay with that . It was the cycle of life , and ProtagonistA was happy to be a part of it . 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the field of our estate , looking at a photograph of ProtagonistB , with the utmost circumstance of safety . ProtagonistA was thinking about how much had changed since ProtagonistB had passed away . It felt like only yesterday that they were sitting in that field together , laughing and joking and enjoying the sunshine . Now , ProtagonistA was all alone . ProtagonistA sighed and put the photograph away , getting to ProtagonistA's feet . ProtagonistA dusted off ProtagonistA's trousers and decided to go for a walk . As ProtagonistA wandered through the estate , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a pang of sadness at all the memories that were now hidden away in the past . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked out over the moon . It was a beautiful night , and ProtagonistA was feeling good . ProtagonistA 'd just finished a big project at work and was looking forward to a well - deserved vacation . ProtagonistA was going to spend a week at ProtagonistA's cabin in the woods , and ProtagonistA could n't wait to get away from it all . As ProtagonistA sat there looking at the moon , ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace come over ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was ready for a break , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would enjoy every minute of it . 
ProtagonistA looked over the map and saw more animals than ProtagonistA's own family . ProtagonistA looked out onto the world and saw that there were so many different types of animals . ProtagonistA saw that there were more animals in the world than ProtagonistA's own family . 
ProtagonistA was a simple man who lived in a small town in northern Syria . ProtagonistA was content to while away ProtagonistA's years in the company of ProtagonistA's friends and family , providing for the needs of ProtagonistA's people . However , when the war came , everything changed . ProtagonistA was forced to flee ProtagonistA's home and take up arms against the invaders . ProtagonistA fought bravely , but ultimately ProtagonistA's town was destroyed and ProtagonistA's people were scattered . ProtagonistA was the only one left . ProtagonistA wandered the countryside , searching for any sign of ProtagonistA's former life . But all ProtagonistA found was death and destruction . Eventually , ProtagonistA came to accept that ProtagonistA's home and ProtagonistA's people were gone forever . ProtagonistA settled down in a new town and started a new life , but ProtagonistA never forgot the loss of ProtagonistA's old one . 
ProtagonistA had always been a go - getter . ProtagonistA was always the one to start new projects and get things done . But lately , ProtagonistA 'd been feeling like something was missing . ProtagonistA could n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to make a change . It took ten years for ProtagonistA to realize what ProtagonistA was really up to . ProtagonistA was always so busy with work and other things that ProtagonistA never stopped to think about what ProtagonistA really wanted in life . But when ProtagonistA turned 40 , ProtagonistA started to reassess ProtagonistA's life and what ProtagonistA really wanted to do with it . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA wanted to slow down and enjoy life more . ProtagonistA did n't want to be constantly chasing after new goals and projects . ProtagonistA wanted to focus on the things that really mattered to ProtagonistA and spend more time with the people ProtagonistA loved . So that 's what ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's high - pressure job and started spending more time with ProtagonistA's family and friends . ProtagonistA took up hobbies that ProtagonistA enjoyed and started living life on ProtagonistA's own terms . It was a big change , but it was exactly what ProtagonistA needed to do . 
ProtagonistA had been living in the forest for years , ever since ProtagonistA ran away from home . ProtagonistA had no idea what had happened to the kingdom ProtagonistA left behind and ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA was content living in the forest , among the animals . But one day , a deer ProtagonistA was friends with told ProtagonistA that the kingdom was in trouble and ProtagonistA was needed . ProtagonistA did n't want to go back , but ProtagonistA could n't just ignore ProtagonistA's friends plea . So , ProtagonistA reluctantly agreed to go on a journey back to the kingdom . ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the great grave , ignorant of all the history of the kingdom . ProtagonistA had no intention of ever going back . But as ProtagonistA looked at the kingdom before ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had to go back . ProtagonistA could n't just leave ProtagonistA's friends and the kingdom ProtagonistA once loved . So , ProtagonistA stood up and began ProtagonistA's journey back to the kingdom . 
ProtagonistA was so much more beautiful than I thought ProtagonistA was that ProtagonistA was going to kill me . I had seen pictures of ProtagonistA before , but they did n't do ProtagonistA justice . ProtagonistA was tall and muscular , with piercing blue eyes and a perfect smile . I was completely mesmerized by ProtagonistA . I knew I was in trouble the moment I saw ProtagonistA . I tried to keep my distance , but ProtagonistA was always there , always watching me . I could feel ProtagonistA's eyes on me , burning into my soul . It was only a matter of time until ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's move . I was right . One day , ProtagonistA came up to me and asked me to go for a walk with ProtagonistA . I knew I should n't , but I could n't resist . I went with ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA led me to a secluded spot . That 's when ProtagonistA attacked me . ProtagonistA was so strong and fast that I could n't defend myself . ProtagonistA hit me and kicked me , and I was sure ProtagonistA was going to kill me . But then , just as suddenly as ProtagonistA had attacked me , ProtagonistA stopped . ProtagonistA looked at me , and I could see the humanity in ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA let me go , and I ran away as fast as I could . I never saw ProtagonistA again , but I will never forget ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen , and ProtagonistA almost killed me . 
ProtagonistA sat on the grass , ProtagonistA's wings spread , ProtagonistA's ears perked up as ProtagonistA listened to the rustle of leaves outside ProtagonistA's window . ProtagonistA loved the sound of the leaves rustling in the wind and ProtagonistA always felt so peaceful when ProtagonistA sat and listened to it . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let the peacefulness wash over ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA's eyes were glassy and ProtagonistA's brain had no thoughts . ProtagonistA was in a coma . The doctors said there was no hope for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's family was by ProtagonistA's side , praying for a miracle . But ProtagonistA was gone . ProtagonistA's body was just a shell . ProtagonistA's soul had left this world . 
I am a destitute orphan living in a time of dire need , reduced to a mere child by ProtagonistA . I have no parents , no home , and no food . I am forced to live on the streets , begging for scraps . I am constantly cold and hungry . I have no hope for the future . One day , I see ProtagonistA walking down the street . ProtagonistA is a wealthy man , and I know that ProtagonistA can help me . I approach ProtagonistA and ask for ProtagonistA's help . ProtagonistA looks at me with pity and gives me a few coins . I am so grateful to ProtagonistA . I know that with ProtagonistA's help , I will be able to survive . 
ProtagonistB watched as ProtagonistA twisted and turned , ProtagonistA's hooves shifting as ProtagonistA tried to keep the position . The other horses in the field were grazing peacefully , but ProtagonistA just could n't seem to find a comfortable spot . ProtagonistB felt sorry for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB knew that there was nothing ProtagonistB could do to help . ProtagonistA would just have to find ProtagonistA's own way to relax . 
Some years ago , I went to see ProtagonistA ; but that name had quite a curious meaning to me , as I had been accustomed to hear ProtagonistA use it when I went into a room where ProtagonistA lived with ProtagonistA's friends and relatives . I had never known ProtagonistA by any other name , and it seemed strange to me that ProtagonistA should have two . However , I found out that ProtagonistA's real name was Robert , and that ProtagonistA only used the diminutive when ProtagonistA was among intimate friends . 
The house where ProtagonistA had lived with ProtagonistA's family had stood empty from the start . It was a big , old house that had been in the family for generations . ProtagonistA's parents had died when ProtagonistA was a child , and ProtagonistA had been raised by ProtagonistA's grandparents . When they died , ProtagonistA was the only one left . ProtagonistA did n't want to sell the house , but ProtagonistA could n't keep it up by ProtagonistA . So , it sat empty . ProtagonistA would come by every now and then to check on it , but it was just too much for ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA got a call from ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had a buyer for the house . ProtagonistA was surprised , but happy . ProtagonistA had been hoping to sell it for years . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB to go ahead and finalize the sale . The next day , ProtagonistA went to the house to sign the papers . ProtagonistA was surprised to see that the new owners were a young couple with a child . They told ProtagonistA that they had always wanted a big , old house like this and they were excited to make it their home . ProtagonistA was happy to see that the house was going to a good family . ProtagonistA said goodbye and went on ProtagonistA's way . The house sat empty for years , but it was finally going to be loved again . 
ProtagonistA had been a human being for as long as ProtagonistA could remember . ProtagonistA had been born in the woods of the north west , and from the banks of the river it seemed that ProtagonistA was the exception to the rule . ProtagonistA had appeared on the banks of the river as a human being , and in reality , ProtagonistA was a human being . ProtagonistA had been a man , and had been of every human class . ProtagonistA had been of every human race , and had been of one or another kind of body . ProtagonistA had possessed more or less of two or three kinds of intelligence , and had been distinguished from ProtagonistA's fellows by some characteristic qualities peculiar to the particular kind of river , or stream , or other watercourse , or channel , or channel by which it was obtained . ProtagonistA had been , however , the object of abhorrent or even loathsome detestable treatment . ProtagonistA had been either tortured or executed for the crime of attempting to escape from the jurisdiction of any superior authority . ProtagonistA had been unwilling either to help the persecutors or to defend ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had been willing to do anything to prevent ProtagonistA's persecutors from killing , or setting out to kill , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had believed ProtagonistA to be innocent , and no less a judge or magistrate than a criminal had charged ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the edge of a tarpaulin in a crowded room with the windows down when the voice whispered in ProtagonistA's ear .  I can see ProtagonistA's future , ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA turned to see who had spoken to ProtagonistA , but there was no one there . ProtagonistA turned back to the tarpaulin and continued to sit . 
ProtagonistB was born as the son of a salaried workman in the midst of a profusion of pre - war industries of industrial importance , and who , having hung on throughout a highly successful career , has made ProtagonistA's fortune by , and in fact made ProtagonistA's fortune quite a while ago , by the methods which ProtagonistA has adopted to capitalize upon ProtagonistA's great fortune , although of late the conflict of interest which ProtagonistC enjoyed , in procuring a certain amount of capital , has become a serious matter .Bob 's father worked hard to provide for his family and instilled the importance of a good work ethic in ProtagonistB . When ProtagonistB was old enough , ProtagonistB started working in one of the pre - war industries and quickly rose through the ranks . Seeing the potential for making a lot of money , ProtagonistB started to capitalize on ProtagonistB's position and soon made a fortune . However , lately ProtagonistB has been having some conflict with ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC is also in a position to make a lot of money , but ProtagonistC has been using some of ProtagonistC's capital to help ProtagonistB out . ProtagonistB is not sure if ProtagonistB wants to continue this arrangement , as it could be seen as a conflict of interest . ProtagonistB is still debating what to do , but ProtagonistB knows that whatever ProtagonistB decides , ProtagonistB will be successful . 
There was ProtagonistA in the full light of the morning , and ProtagonistA was walking to work . ProtagonistA had a lot on ProtagonistA's mind and was deep in thought . ProtagonistA did n't see the car coming until it was too late . ProtagonistA was hit by the car and died instantly . 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was the only unicorn . ProtagonistA had never seen another one like ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA was the only one in the world . One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was so happy to finally meet another unicorn . 
ProtagonistA had never known ProtagonistA's father did n't like ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA always thought ProtagonistA's father loved ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was always critical of ProtagonistA . Nothing ProtagonistA ever did was good enough for ProtagonistA's father . ProtagonistA tried ProtagonistA's best to please ProtagonistA's father , but it was never enough . One day , ProtagonistA's father passed away . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost the one person who loved ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was now left with the feeling that ProtagonistA's father never really loved ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner . ProtagonistA never really felt like ProtagonistA fit in anywhere . So , when ProtagonistA finally met ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was thrilled . Unfortunately , ProtagonistB turned out to be a psychopath who wanted nothing more than to see ProtagonistA dead . ProtagonistA should have known something was wrong when ProtagonistB started making strange comments about wanting to kill people . But ProtagonistA did n't want to believe that ProtagonistB could be so dark and twisted . Sadly , ProtagonistA was wrong . One night , ProtagonistB attacked ProtagonistA with a knife , intent on killing ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was only able to survive by pure luck , and ProtagonistA was left with some serious injuries . It was the first night of the rest of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was finally able to see ProtagonistB for the monster that ProtagonistB was . And ProtagonistA was determined to make sure that ProtagonistA would never be victimized like that again . 
ProtagonistA had heard the talk of a great city , but ProtagonistA had never seen any of it . ProtagonistA had always been content with ProtagonistA's small town life , but when ProtagonistA retired , ProtagonistA decided to finally take a trip to see the city for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was amazed by the sights and sounds of the city , and ProtagonistA even found ProtagonistA a new hobby - people watching . ProtagonistA would spend hours sitting in the park , observing the endless stream of people going by . It was a great way to spend ProtagonistA's retirement , and ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA finally got to see the city ProtagonistA had always heard so much about . 
ProtagonistA had been in a coma for three months , ever since the car accident . ProtagonistA's family had been told that ProtagonistA was not expected to wake up , and they were making arrangements for ProtagonistA's funeral . But on the day of the funeral , ProtagonistA suddenly woke up . ProtagonistA could not remember anything about ProtagonistA's life before the accident . ProtagonistA's family was overjoyed to have ProtagonistA back , but ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was starting from scratch . ProtagonistA did not know who ProtagonistA was or where ProtagonistA came from . But ProtagonistA was determined to find out . With the help of ProtagonistA's family and friends , ProtagonistA slowly began to piece together ProtagonistA's life . And ProtagonistA realized that the day ProtagonistA woke up from ProtagonistA's coma was the first day of the rest of ProtagonistA's life . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider . ProtagonistA was never quite sure why , but it seemed like ProtagonistA was always on the outside looking in when it came to social gatherings . So , when ProtagonistA was invited to a party at the age of fourteen , ProtagonistA was beyond excited . The party was everything ProtagonistA had hoped for and more . There were so many people and they were all having so much fun . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA finally belonged somewhere . ProtagonistA laughed and danced and talked with everyone there and had the time of ProtagonistA's life . When the party was over , ProtagonistA went home with a feeling of happiness and belonging . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had finally found ProtagonistA's place in the world . 
And tearing Bob 's father 's arm off , ProtagonistA did not spring a foot . The arm was bloody and mangled , but still attached to the body . Bob 's father screamed in agony as ProtagonistA continued to pull and tear at the limb . Finally , with a final , sickening rip , the arm came free from the socket and Bob 's father collapsed to the ground , unconscious from the pain .

But first , you have to find ProtagonistA's body . 
ProtagonistA had been taking the ferry down to the harbor every day for years . ProtagonistA knew every twist and turn of the winding stone steps . But today , something was different . As ProtagonistA took the ferry down the steps , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB lying at the bottom . ProtagonistB , please get up ,  said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA took the ferry down the winding stone steps into the harbor .  ProtagonistA ca n't leave ProtagonistB here . But ProtagonistB did n't move . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA had never seen anyone like ProtagonistB before . ProtagonistB was wearing strange clothes and ProtagonistB's skin was a different color . ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA should help ProtagonistB or not . Finally , ProtagonistA made up ProtagonistA's mind . ProtagonistA would help ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA went down to ProtagonistB and tried to lift ProtagonistB up , but ProtagonistB was too heavy . ProtagonistA could n't do it by ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA shouted for help , but no one came . Finally , ProtagonistA saw a group of men coming down the steps . They were laughing and joking , but when they saw ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB , they stopped . What 's going on here ?  one of the men asked . I found ProtagonistB at the bottom of the steps . ProtagonistA think ProtagonistB 's hurt ,  ProtagonistA said . The men hesitated for a moment , but then they came over and helped ProtagonistA lift ProtagonistB . They carried ProtagonistB up the steps and into the town . ProtagonistA never saw ProtagonistB again , but ProtagonistA always wondered what happened to ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA had seen a lot of death in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA 'd been a soldier for years , and ProtagonistA 'd seen ProtagonistA's friends die in battle . But this was different . This was cold , calculated murder . And the worst part was , ProtagonistA was powerless to stop it . ProtagonistA watched , frozen in horror , as the man was killed . It was brutal , and it was quick . There was no mercy , no hesitation . ProtagonistB did n't even seem to care that ProtagonistA was watching . It was over in seconds . The man was dead , and ProtagonistA was left alone with his body . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA felt sick to ProtagonistA's stomach , and ProtagonistA wanted to vomit . But ProtagonistA forced ProtagonistA to stay calm . ProtagonistA had to think . ProtagonistB was still out there , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was next . 
ProtagonistA was a man of the people , and at the time that ProtagonistA was travelling so very far , that ProtagonistA was not aware of its importance . ProtagonistA was on a journey to find ProtagonistA , and in doing so , ProtagonistA found something much greater . ProtagonistA found a purpose . ProtagonistA found a reason to keep going , even when the going got tough . ProtagonistA found love . 
ProtagonistA was imprisoned no less than twenty - seven times on the Disc of the Dead , and it has been since then that ProtagonistA has been allowed a solitary passage out of ProtagonistA's cell . ProtagonistA has been a model prisoner since ProtagonistA's last release , and the warden has been lenient with ProtagonistA . But today , something is different . The warden comes to ProtagonistA's cell and tells ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA is to be executed . ProtagonistA does not protest or beg for mercy , ProtagonistA simply accepts ProtagonistA's fate . As ProtagonistA is led to the execution chamber , ProtagonistA thinks about ProtagonistA's life and all of the times ProtagonistA has been in prison . ProtagonistA wonders if this is finally the end for ProtagonistA . The executioner asks ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA has any last words , and ProtagonistA says simply ,  ProtagonistA have been in prison 27 times , and this is the 28th . ProtagonistA have always been allowed a solitary passage out of ProtagonistA's cell . ProtagonistA hope that this time , ProtagonistA will be allowed the same .  With that , ProtagonistA is executed . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider . ProtagonistA was never quite sure why , but ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA did n't quite fit in with the other kids at school . ProtagonistA had always been a bit taller and lankier than the other kids ProtagonistA's age and ProtagonistA had always been a bit more mature , as if ProtagonistA was carrying the weight of the world on ProtagonistA's shoulders . But by the time ProtagonistA reached ProtagonistA's limits , ProtagonistA was an ordinary young man - not quite fourteen , but in the right sort of body . ProtagonistA had finally started to fill out and ProtagonistA was beginning to look like the man ProtagonistA would one day become . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a dreamer and ProtagonistA had always had big plans for ProtagonistA's future . ProtagonistA wanted to travel the world and see all the amazing things it had to offer . ProtagonistA wanted to make a difference in the world and help people who were less fortunate than ProtagonistA was . And ProtagonistA wanted to find the love of ProtagonistA's life and settle down . But by the time ProtagonistA reached ProtagonistA's limits , ProtagonistA was beginning to realize that ProtagonistA's dreams might never come true . ProtagonistA was stuck in a small town with no prospects of ever getting out . ProtagonistA had a dead - end job and ProtagonistA was stuck in a cycle of poverty that ProtagonistA could never seem to break out of . ProtagonistA's relationship with the love of ProtagonistA's life was on the rocks and ProtagonistA was starting to lose hope that things would ever get better . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an optimist , but by the time ProtagonistA reached ProtagonistA's limits , ProtagonistA was starting to feel like a failure . ProtagonistA had always thought that ProtagonistA would amount to something , but now ProtagonistA was just an ordinary young man with no prospects and no future . 
In the year 1838 , ProtagonistA published ProtagonistA's scientific treatise , entitled , Energetic Forces and Energy , in which ProtagonistA distinguishes between the forms of energy , invisible to the senses , and those which have a definite object , the third and highest form of Energy . This was a groundbreaking work at the time and helped to establish ProtagonistA as one of the leading scientific minds of ProtagonistA's generation . 
ProtagonistA had been married for years , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly . However , lately ProtagonistA had been feeling restless . ProtagonistA had always wanted to travel and see the world , and now that ProtagonistB was getting older , ProtagonistA felt like it was finally time to do something for ProtagonistA . So , one day , ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and left ProtagonistB alone in the garden . ProtagonistA went to pick up the newspaper and dipped it into ProtagonistA's cupboard , wishing ProtagonistA had a camera and a memory of where ProtagonistA had put it the week before . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would be heartbroken when ProtagonistA left , but ProtagonistA did n't want to burden ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's wanderlust . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would be better off without ProtagonistA . As ProtagonistA drove away from ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA felt a mixture of sadness and excitement . ProtagonistA was sad to be leaving ProtagonistB behind , but ProtagonistA was also excited to finally be embarking on ProtagonistA's own adventure . Who knows what the future holds ? ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA drove into the sunset . 
ProtagonistA usually sat at ProtagonistA's desk and wrote in a notebook . ProtagonistA was a writer , and ProtagonistA found that writing in a notebook was the best way for ProtagonistA to get ProtagonistA's ideas down . Today , however , ProtagonistA was having trouble focusing . ProtagonistA kept thinking about the fight ProtagonistA had with ProtagonistB the night before . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to apologize to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was n't sure how to go about it . ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear ProtagonistC come in .  ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said ,  ProtagonistC need to talk to ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA turned to ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistC could see the sadness in ProtagonistA's eyes .  What 's wrong ?  ProtagonistC asked .  Nothing ,  ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA 'm just having a bad day .  
ProtagonistA was a unicorn , and ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's best friend . ProtagonistB trusted ProtagonistA with everything , even ProtagonistB's tongue . But one day , ProtagonistA betrayed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA said something mean to ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB felt ProtagonistB's heart break . ProtagonistB realized then that ProtagonistB never should have trusted ProtagonistA , because ProtagonistA was n't real . ProtagonistA was just a figment of ProtagonistB's imagination . 
Slow , steady , and thoughtful , the moment ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's seat at the table , Equestrians moved through the dark and the undulating hall of the palace , picking vixens and lasses out of the crowd and casting them away to dance with the three most beautiful sisters of the Siras Academy . The music was low and sensual , and the air was thick with the scent of jasmine and musk . ProtagonistA's heart quickened as ProtagonistA watched the sisters move gracefully around the room . ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it . They were like goddesses . Suddenly , ProtagonistB , turned and looked directly at ProtagonistA . Their eyes locked , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart skip a beat . ProtagonistB smiled , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's whole body relax . ProtagonistA knew in that moment that ProtagonistA was going to dance with ProtagonistB . Slowly , ProtagonistA stood up and made ProtagonistA's way across the room . ProtagonistA could feel the eyes of the other guests on ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't care . All ProtagonistA could focus on was ProtagonistB . When ProtagonistA reached ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA's hand and led ProtagonistA onto the dance floor . The music swelled around them , and they began to move . It was as if they were one person . They flowed together effortlessly , their bodies molding to each other perfectly . ProtagonistA had never felt so alive . As the music came to a close , ProtagonistB dipped ProtagonistA low and kissed ProtagonistA lightly on the lips . ProtagonistA's head was spinning . ProtagonistA had never felt this way before . ProtagonistB pulled away and smiled at ProtagonistA .  Thank ProtagonistA for the dance ,  ProtagonistB said . ProtagonistA could barely find the words to respond .  It was ProtagonistA's pleasure ,  ProtagonistA managed to say . ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB walk away , feeling like ProtagonistA had just been given the most precious gift in the world . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget this night . 
The House of Parliament , in the house of the Lords , had passed an act , which ProtagonistA expressly reserved to ProtagonistA , for a certain purposes , and without any previous consent of ProtagonistA , which provided , that the title of ProtagonistA , for the whole period that ProtagonistA was under the age of twenty - one years , should be , and ProtagonistA should be called , Lord Bob . 
ProtagonistA was stabbed in the throat , ProtagonistA's heart ripped apart by the knife . ProtagonistA collapsed to the ground , gasping for air as the life drained out of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's killer stood over ProtagonistA , a satisfied smirk on their face . ProtagonistA's vision started to fade and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die . ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistA's wife and kids , and how they would never see ProtagonistA again . As ProtagonistA's life ended , ProtagonistA swore ProtagonistA would get revenge on ProtagonistA's killer . 
ProtagonistA was never the best sleeper . ProtagonistA would always find ProtagonistA tossing and turning throughout the night , never able to get comfortable . ProtagonistA's parents had tried everything to help ProtagonistA sleep better , but nothing seemed to work . They had even taken ProtagonistA to see a sleep specialist , but nothing helped . ProtagonistA's parents were at their wit 's end . One night , ProtagonistA's parents decided to take ProtagonistA for a walk around the block before bed . They were two blocks from the school door and three blocks from the flat that always seemed to be the last place to put ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA went to sleep . As they walked , ProtagonistA's parents talked to ProtagonistA about ProtagonistA's day and what ProtagonistA had learned in school . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA getting sleepy as they walked and by the time they got back to the flat , ProtagonistA was fast asleep . ProtagonistA's parents were amazed . They could n't believe that something as simple as a walk around the block had helped ProtagonistA sleep . From that night on , they made sure to take ProtagonistA for a walk around the block every night before bed . And , finally , after years of struggling , ProtagonistA was able to sleep through the night . 
In the days when ProtagonistA tried to forget or suppress all sense of history , ProtagonistA made a point of discussing ProtagonistA's own ministry with ProtagonistA's fellow church members and those whom ProtagonistA met through the temple . ProtagonistA was always careful to keep ProtagonistA's stories about ProtagonistA's ministry separate from ProtagonistA's stories about ProtagonistA's personal life . This way , ProtagonistA could forget about ProtagonistA's past and focus on the present . However , one day , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to tell ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's ministry . ProtagonistA hesitated at first , but then ProtagonistA began to open up . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the people ProtagonistA had met and the places ProtagonistA had been . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the good times and the bad times . As ProtagonistA spoke , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been suppressing ProtagonistA's memories for too long . ProtagonistA had been trying to forget about ProtagonistA's past , but it was time to face it . ProtagonistB listened patiently as ProtagonistA spoke , and ProtagonistB was there for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA needed ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by comets . ProtagonistA would spend hours staring up at the night sky , dreaming of one day seeing one up close . So when ProtagonistA saw one streaking across the sky , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to follow it . ProtagonistA chartered a boat and set sail down the Thames . After a few days of sailing , ProtagonistA spotted the comet in the distance . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was heading straight for London . ProtagonistA called out to the sailors of the Thames , warning them of the comet . But no one listened to ProtagonistA . They just laughed and called ProtagonistA a crazy old man . ProtagonistA did n't care what they thought . ProtagonistA knew the comet was going to hit London and ProtagonistA had to warn people . But no one would listen to ProtagonistA . Eventually , the comet did hit London . ProtagonistA watched in horror as the city was destroyed . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had tried to warn people , but no one would listen . 
ProtagonistA was killed in a car accident . It happened that ProtagonistA had six daughters , two known to the world , and two known to ProtagonistA's friends and family . ProtagonistA's wife , who was also in the car , was killed instantly . ProtagonistA's daughters were devastated . The two who were known to the world were forced to deal with their grief in the public eye . The other two were able to grieve in private . ProtagonistA's daughters were all very different . The two who were known to the world were very successful . The other two were not . ProtagonistA's death affected them all in different ways . 
ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by magic . As a child , ProtagonistA would watch the magicians in the circus perform their amazing feats and dream of one day being able to do the same . So when ProtagonistA was given a magic kit for ProtagonistA's birthday , ProtagonistA was over the moon . For weeks , ProtagonistA practised the tricks ProtagonistA had learned from the book that came with the kit . But no matter how hard ProtagonistA tried , ProtagonistA just could n't make them work . ProtagonistA was beginning to lose hope that ProtagonistA would ever be able to do real magic . Then , one day , as ProtagonistA was practising a trick , something amazing happened . Glittering with the colors of magic , ProtagonistA blinked widely , as though ProtagonistA were trying to find the light . And then , suddenly , ProtagonistA saw it - the light of the magic ProtagonistA had been searching for . From that day on , ProtagonistA was a master of magic . 
ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was afraid of ghosts . ProtagonistA had never seen one , but ProtagonistA had heard stories . ProtagonistA's friends would always tell ProtagonistA about the time they saw a ghost , or the time their cousin 's friend 's brother 's ghost . ProtagonistA would always get so scared and ProtagonistA would never want to sleep alone . One night , ProtagonistA was home alone . ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's room , trying to sleep , when ProtagonistA heard a noise . It sounded like someone was walking around downstairs . ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to investigate . ProtagonistA did n't see anything , but ProtagonistA could still hear the noise . It sounded like someone was walking around in circles . ProtagonistA was so scared that ProtagonistA ran back to ProtagonistA's room and hid under the covers . ProtagonistA did n't come out until the sun was up . ProtagonistA was sure that there was a ghost in ProtagonistA's house , but ProtagonistA never saw it again . 
The Emperor of the Day , who , according to the law of physics , died in the year of five thousand eight hundred and two , gave to ProtagonistA the title of Emperor , and naturally this title made ProtagonistA powerful , and this powerful so that ProtagonistA could make a bargain with anybody . ProtagonistA was a simple man , and ProtagonistA did n't really understand the power that ProtagonistA had been given , but ProtagonistA knew that it was important . ProtagonistA used ProtagonistA's power to make deals with the other Emperors , and ProtagonistA was always able to get what ProtagonistA wanted . ProtagonistA was a great Emperor , and ProtagonistA ruled for many years . 
ProtagonistA , in my modest opinion , was walking home in ProtagonistA's own shoes , with ProtagonistA's hat on , from the back of the church , where ProtagonistA had been having the rough passage due to he , and which was . ProtagonistA was a bit down in the dumps , but ProtagonistA tried to keep ProtagonistA's chin up . ProtagonistA was looking forward to getting home , taking ProtagonistA's shoes off , and putting ProtagonistA's feet up . When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA was surprised to see ProtagonistB waiting for ProtagonistA at the door . ProtagonistB was crying and looked very upset . ProtagonistA's heart sank . ProtagonistA knew that something was wrong . Turns out , ProtagonistB had been diagnosed with cancer . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had failed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was supposed to be the strong one , but ProtagonistA just could n't handle it . ProtagonistA broke down in tears and hugged ProtagonistB tightly . They both knew that this was going to be a long , hard battle , but they were ready to fight it together . 
I first met ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA was nineteen years old and ProtagonistA was working as a dressmaker in the East End of London . ProtagonistA was a tall , thin man with a kind face and a quick wit . We became friends immediately , and I soon learned that ProtagonistA was one of the most talented dressmakers in the city . ProtagonistA's designs were elegant and ProtagonistA's attention to detail was impeccable . ProtagonistA was always happy to help me with my own dressmaking projects , and I was constantly amazed by ProtagonistA's skill . Over the years , we remained close friends , and I was always thrilled to see ProtagonistA's latest creations . ProtagonistA eventually moved away to pursue ProtagonistA's career , but we kept in touch and I was always eager to see ProtagonistA's newest designs . I was honoured to be able to attend ProtagonistA's fashion show last year , and I was blown away by the beauty of ProtagonistA's creations . ProtagonistA has truly become one of the most talented and respected dressmakers in the world , and I am so proud to have been ProtagonistA's friend from the very beginning . 
The U - boat crash into the moor was a horrific sight . The large ship was covered in splinters , and there was a corpse of ProtagonistA inside . It was clear that ProtagonistA had been murdered in some strange way . ProtagonistB was aboard the ship when it happened , and ProtagonistB was the one who first saw it . ProtagonistB was horrified by what ProtagonistB saw , and ProtagonistB knew that something strange had happened . 
ProtagonistB had been battling ovarian cancer for years , and ProtagonistA had been by ProtagonistB's side every step of the way . ProtagonistA had been with ProtagonistB in the hospital the night before ProtagonistB passed away , holding ProtagonistB's hand and telling ProtagonistB how much ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB . The next morning , ProtagonistA woke up from a dream in which ProtagonistB was still alive and healthy . ProtagonistA was so overwhelmed with happiness and relief that ProtagonistA started to cry . It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever experienced a dream like this , and it was the most powerful one ProtagonistA 'd ever had . 
ProtagonistA thought that was it then , ProtagonistA's dear friend said as ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's back on the landscape . All will be well , ProtagonistA thought . ProtagonistA am free , though ProtagonistA doubt it . Even an assassination attempt in the capital would be unlikely . Oh , ProtagonistA know it 's a bad idea . ProtagonistA was at a party once . It was a grand affair , hosted by the richest man in the city . ProtagonistA had been invited because ProtagonistA was good friends with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA remembered how out of place ProtagonistA felt , surrounded by the wealthy elite . ProtagonistA had been sipping on a glass of wine , when ProtagonistA overheard two men talking . I do n't know why he 's still alive . We 've tried everything . I know , but we ca n't keep trying . It 's too risky . ProtagonistA did n't know who they were talking about , but ProtagonistA had a feeling it was n't good . ProtagonistA did n't want to get involved , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do something . ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB and told ProtagonistB what ProtagonistA had overheard . ProtagonistB was horrified . ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB's father had enemies , but ProtagonistB never thought they would go this far . ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help and promised to keep ProtagonistA safe . ProtagonistA thought that was the end of it , but ProtagonistA was wrong . A few weeks later , ProtagonistA was attacked in the street . ProtagonistA was beaten and left for dead , but ProtagonistA survived . ProtagonistA knew then that ProtagonistA had to leave the city . ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's friend and said goodbye . ProtagonistA promised to keep in touch , but ProtagonistA never did . ProtagonistA knew it was for the best . ProtagonistA had to start a new life , somewhere far away from the danger . 
It is a month of extreme hardship for ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA can not possibly be surprised by the scene which I have set before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB is a frail woman , and ProtagonistB is struggling to keep up with the demands of ProtagonistB's husband 's estate . ProtagonistB has been forced to take on many of the responsibilities that ProtagonistB's husband can no longer handle , and ProtagonistB is struggling to keep up . ProtagonistB is not the only one who is struggling . ProtagonistA , is also having a difficult time . ProtagonistA is trying to help ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA is also trying to keep up with ProtagonistA's own studies . ProtagonistB is grateful for the help that ProtagonistA is giving , but ProtagonistB can tell that ProtagonistA is struggling . ProtagonistB is worried about ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB is worried about the future . 
ProtagonistA had always been good at cards . ProtagonistA could remember back to when ProtagonistA was just a boy , sitting around the kitchen table with ProtagonistA's brothers and sisters , playing for pennies . ProtagonistA had always had a knack for reading people and knowing what cards they were holding . As ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA started to play for higher stakes . ProtagonistA began to travel from town to town , pitting ProtagonistA's skills against anyone who was willing to play ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA quickly gained a reputation as the best card player around . People would flock to see ProtagonistA play , and ProtagonistA always managed to walk away with more money than ProtagonistA started with . One day , ProtagonistA heard about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB's name was Ruben de Vros , and ProtagonistB lived in a far - off land . ProtagonistA was determined to beat ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA set out on ProtagonistA's journey , and after a long and arduous journey , ProtagonistA finally arrived at ProtagonistB's doorstep . They sat down to play , and after a long and intense game , ProtagonistA finally emerged victorious . ProtagonistA had become the world 's best card player , and ProtagonistA had stolen the title from ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA was packing ProtagonistA's bag full of pastries , fully aware that ProtagonistA might run into an unusual custom in the future . ProtagonistA was also anticipating Croaking to find a new friend to eat with .  At least ProtagonistA 'm not going to eat them ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm fully aware that ProtagonistA 'm packing a bag full of pastries in case ProtagonistA run into an unusual custom in the future , and in anticipation of Croaking to find a new friend to eat with .  
ProtagonistA had been on the City - Ship for as long as ProtagonistA could remember . It was all ProtagonistA knew . But now , ProtagonistA's time was up . The steel doors of the City - Ship slid open and ProtagonistA stepped out , ProtagonistA's left arm crossed over ProtagonistA's chest , as though ProtagonistA were about to slide into oblivion . ProtagonistA did n't know what was out there , but ProtagonistA knew it was time to find out . It was time to leave the only home ProtagonistA 'd ever known . 
ProtagonistA had been fighting in the war for years . ProtagonistA had seen too much death and destruction to count . All ProtagonistA wanted was to go home to ProtagonistA's family and finally have some peace . Twelve days of leave were all ProtagonistA was given , but it was better than nothing . ProtagonistA arrived home to a hero 's welcome . ProtagonistA's wife and children were there to greet ProtagonistA with open arms . For the first few days , they just spent time catching up and enjoying each other 's company . However , on the third day , the heat of the war began to catch up with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA started to have nightmares and flashbacks of all the terrible things ProtagonistA had seen . ProtagonistA's family did their best to comfort ProtagonistA , but on the sixth day , ProtagonistA sunk into a deep depression . ProtagonistA did n't want to eat or leave ProtagonistA's bed . ProtagonistA just wanted the pain to go away . On the ninth day , ProtagonistA's fever finally began to subside . At the same time , the fever of the war began to subside in ProtagonistA's mind . ProtagonistA finally started to feel like ProtagonistA again . ProtagonistA's family was there for ProtagonistA through everything . They helped ProtagonistA heal both physically and mentally . Finally , after years of fighting , ProtagonistA was able to find some peace . 
ProtagonistA , sitting crosslegged on a damp stone floor , had a cigarette lighter in each hand , and a bundle of twigs in front of ProtagonistA , containing nothing but a wide - brimmed hat and a pair of straw gloves . ProtagonistA was trying to light a fire , but the dampness of the twigs made it difficult . ProtagonistA had been at it for hours , and ProtagonistA's fingers were starting to cramp . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw a spark catch on one of the twigs . ProtagonistA quickly blew on it , and soon a small fire was burning . ProtagonistA put the hat and gloves on , and sat back to enjoy the warmth . 
Deep within a blue - green void , ProtagonistA was very proud of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was like a proud and very happy man , very pleased with himself . In the same way as a proud and very happy man is very happy with himself , ProtagonistA was also very happy with ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had been hunting for days , ever since the villagers had snatched ProtagonistB from ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had tracked them to this valley , and now ProtagonistA had found the body of ProtagonistB , lying among the trees and wildflowers . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never be able to bring ProtagonistB back to life , but ProtagonistA could at least give ProtagonistB a proper burial . 
ProtagonistA was a man of genius , even when ProtagonistA was young , and one who carried on ProtagonistA's mind without restraint the deep doctrine of national devotion which was then in fashion . ProtagonistA was brought up in the strictest principles of loyalty to ProtagonistA's country , and ProtagonistA's whole life was one long series of patriotic actions . ProtagonistA's country was always first in ProtagonistA's thoughts , and ProtagonistA never wavered in ProtagonistA's allegiance to it . Even when ProtagonistA was old and infirm , ProtagonistA's mind was still full of the love of ProtagonistA's country , and ProtagonistA died as ProtagonistA had lived , a devoted patriot . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an oddball , and ProtagonistA's eighteenth year was no different . ProtagonistA had just finished high school and was eager to start ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA's parents had always been supportive , but they were also relieved when ProtagonistA finally graduated . They had been worried about ProtagonistA for years , and they knew that ProtagonistA was going to have to find ProtagonistA's own way in life . ProtagonistA's first order of business was to find a wife . ProtagonistA had always been attracted to older women , and ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's sights set on ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was convinced that ProtagonistB was the one for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was determined to make ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's wife . ProtagonistA's parents were not thrilled with ProtagonistA's choice of bride , but they knew that they could not stop ProtagonistA . They gave ProtagonistA their blessing , and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB set off on their honeymoon . ProtagonistA was in for a surprise . ProtagonistB was not what ProtagonistA had expected . ProtagonistB was demanding , and ProtagonistB wanted ProtagonistA to do everything ProtagonistB's way . ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA had made a mistake , but ProtagonistA was not sure how to get out of it . ProtagonistA tried to make the best of it , but the honeymoon was a disaster . ProtagonistB was constantly complaining , and ProtagonistB made it clear that ProtagonistB was not happy . ProtagonistA was relieved when the honeymoon was finally over , and ProtagonistA was able to go home to ProtagonistA's parents . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had made a mistake , but ProtagonistA was not ready to give up on ProtagonistA's dream of finding the perfect wife . ProtagonistA was determined to find ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was willing to wait as long as it took . 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's third year of college and things were going great . ProtagonistA was doing well in ProtagonistA's classes and had a lot of friends . ProtagonistA was even dating ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life and did n't see any reason to change anything . One day , ProtagonistB broke up with ProtagonistA out of the blue . ProtagonistA was heartbroken and did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA did n't want to go to classes or see ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA just wanted to be alone . Eventually , ProtagonistA started to pull ProtagonistA out of ProtagonistA's slump . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistB was n't worth ProtagonistA's time and that ProtagonistA was better off without ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA started hanging out with ProtagonistA's friends again and doing better in ProtagonistA's classes . ProtagonistA was finally happy again . Looking back , ProtagonistA realized that the break - up was the best thing that could have ever happened to ProtagonistA . It made ProtagonistA realize that ProtagonistA was better off without ProtagonistB and that ProtagonistA had a lot of great friends and a bright future ahead of ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had been hoping that ProtagonistA had died in an airplane accident . ProtagonistA was tired of ProtagonistA's life and felt like ProtagonistA had nothing to live for . ProtagonistA was always getting into arguments with ProtagonistA's wife and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was a failure as a husband and a father . ProtagonistA was always getting passed over for promotions at work and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA's boss was never going to give ProtagonistA a chance to prove ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was tired of feeling like a failure and ProtagonistA wanted to end it all . So when ProtagonistA heard about the plane crash , ProtagonistA was hoping that ProtagonistA would be one of the victims . ProtagonistA was hoping that ProtagonistA's death would be quick and painless and that ProtagonistA's family would be better off without ProtagonistA . But when ProtagonistA woke up in the hospital , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was still alive and that ProtagonistA had to face ProtagonistA's problems head on . ProtagonistA was going to have to make some changes in ProtagonistA's life if ProtagonistA ever wanted to be happy again . 
ProtagonistA had always loved books . ProtagonistA loved the way they smelled , the way they felt in ProtagonistA's hands , and the way they took ProtagonistA to places ProtagonistA had never been before . When ProtagonistA was thirteen , ProtagonistA started dating ProtagonistA's first book . It was called In a Sentence or an Exposition and ProtagonistA dated it for three months , noting the date in the front of the book . ProtagonistA loved spending time with it , reading it over and over again . But eventually ProtagonistA started to doubt whether or not the book was really the right one for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA started to feel like maybe ProtagonistA was too young for it , that it was too complicated for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA started to think that maybe ProtagonistA should find a book that was more ProtagonistA's level . But ProtagonistA did n't want to break up with In a Sentence or an Exposition , so ProtagonistA just stopped dating it , stopped reading it , and put it back on the shelf . 
In the year of our Lord 2001 , ProtagonistA was sitting in the chair , with ProtagonistA's hat on the mantelpiece , and ProtagonistB next to ProtagonistA , which was a very strange arrangement . ProtagonistA was a large man , with a hearty laugh and a jovial disposition . ProtagonistB was quiet and withdrawn , with a nervous air about ProtagonistB . They had been sitting in silence for some time , when ProtagonistB finally spoke . ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB need to ask ProtagonistA a favor . ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB , a little taken aback .  Sure , anything ProtagonistB need . I need ProtagonistA to kill ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was stunned . ProtagonistA did n't know what to say or how to respond . ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA imploringly . ProtagonistB ca n't go on living like this . ProtagonistB 'm in so much pain , ProtagonistA . Please , just end it for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was torn . ProtagonistA did n't want to kill ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could see the pain and suffering ProtagonistB was in . Finally , ProtagonistA nodded . Okay , ProtagonistA 'll do it . The smaller man looked relieved . ProtagonistA got up and went to the mantelpiece , where ProtagonistA took down ProtagonistA's hat . ProtagonistA walked back to ProtagonistB and put the hat on ProtagonistB's head . I'm sorry , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said , before pulling the trigger .

Ever since the day ProtagonistA was born , ProtagonistA has asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was really made of , and yet always comes away with the same conclusion : ProtagonistA is a very odd little thing indeed ! As a child , ProtagonistA would often find ProtagonistA wondering why ProtagonistA was so different from everyone else . ProtagonistA would ask ProtagonistA's parents , ProtagonistA's teachers , and even ProtagonistA's friends , but no one could ever give ProtagonistA a satisfactory answer . As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to accept that ProtagonistA was just a weird little guy and that was that . ProtagonistA did n't let it bother ProtagonistA too much , and ProtagonistA actually found that ProtagonistA quite liked being different . It made ProtagonistA feel special and unique , like there was no one else quite like ProtagonistA in the world .

ProtagonistA twirled the peg - leg around in ProtagonistA's eyes , and the tough leather straps under ProtagonistA's arms , as ProtagonistA stood on the platform of one of the other ships that crowded the bottom of the middle city . ProtagonistA was a tall , lanky man , with a long , thin face that was almost always topped with a faded blue bandana . ProtagonistA's eyes were a cold , hard blue , and ProtagonistA's mouth was set in a perpetual scowl . ProtagonistA was wearing a worn leather jacket and a pair of faded jeans . ProtagonistA's peg - leg thumped against the wooden platform as ProtagonistA shifted ProtagonistA's weight . ProtagonistA was waiting for the ship that would take ProtagonistA to the top of the city . ProtagonistA had been waiting for a long time , and ProtagonistA was getting impatient . ProtagonistA wanted to get out of the middle city and see the world . ProtagonistA had been born in the middle city , and ProtagonistA had never left it . ProtagonistA had heard stories about the top of the city , and ProtagonistA was eager to see it for ProtagonistA . Finally , the ship arrived . It was a large , imposing vessel , with a black flag flying from its mast . ProtagonistA boarded the ship , and it set sail for the top of the city . As the ship sailed through the middle city , ProtagonistA looked down at the people below . They all looked so small and insignificant from up here . ProtagonistA felt a sense of power and excitement as ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was finally going to see the world . The ship arrived at the top of the city , and ProtagonistA disembarked . ProtagonistA looked around , and ProtagonistA's eyes widened in wonder . ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it . The buildings were so tall , and there were so many people . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had finally arrived in the place ProtagonistA had always dreamed of . 
ProtagonistA sat in the saddle and considered the plan ProtagonistA 'd been given . It was a simple enough plan , but it would take some work . ProtagonistA was to ride into town and ask around for ProtagonistB . Once ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was to bring ProtagonistB back to the ranch . It sounded easy enough , but ProtagonistA knew that it would n't be . ProtagonistA had never been good at talking to women , and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would n't be any different . But , ProtagonistA was a man of ProtagonistA's word , and ProtagonistA would do as ProtagonistA was asked . ProtagonistA just hoped that ProtagonistA would n't make a fool of ProtagonistA in the process . 
ProtagonistA had a solid build , and a big , broad smile on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA was always the life of the party , and always had a kind word for everyone . ProtagonistA was the kind of guy that you just could n't help but like . One day , ProtagonistA was out walking around ProtagonistA's neighborhood , when ProtagonistA ran into ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was grumbling about everything that was going wrong in ProtagonistB's life . ProtagonistA listened patiently , and then offered some words of encouragement . ProtagonistB was surprised at how positive ProtagonistA was , and it made ProtagonistB feel a little better . ProtagonistA continued on ProtagonistA's way , spreading ProtagonistA's happiness and good cheer to everyone ProtagonistA met . It was just ProtagonistA's nature . ProtagonistA was always making people smile , and that was one of the things that made ProtagonistA so special . 
ProtagonistA had been on the road for months , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to get homesick . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's cozy little house and ProtagonistA's comfortable bed . Most of all , ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been all over the world , and ProtagonistA had seen some amazing things , but ProtagonistA was ready to be done with this whole traveling business . ProtagonistA wanted to go home and take a long nap . One morning , ProtagonistA woke up in ProtagonistA's hotel room in Japan and decided that today was the day ProtagonistA was going to head back home . ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things , said goodbye to ProtagonistA's tour group , and caught the next flight home . It was great to be back in ProtagonistA's own house , and ProtagonistB was there to greet ProtagonistA at the door . ProtagonistA was so happy to be home , and ProtagonistA vowed to never go on another long journey again . 
ProtagonistA had nothing to do with it , ProtagonistA said . But I know ProtagonistA did . I saw ProtagonistA hide the evidence . There 's no way the crime could have been committed without ProtagonistA's involvement . But I ca n't prove it . I do n't have any evidence . So I 'll just have to let ProtagonistA go .

ProtagonistA was born on a summer day , and ProtagonistA was drowned with a weakling 's mind and thin frame . ProtagonistA was never given a chance to live a full life .

All they have is the memory of the day ProtagonistA was born , and the day ProtagonistA died . 
It was not long ago , when ProtagonistA first visited the forest , that ProtagonistA had come across a herd of very lean , very short - legged geldings , without heads or tails , that were waiting for the moon to rise . ProtagonistA was so astonished by this sight that ProtagonistA could not help but stare . The geldings seemed to be in a trance , and they made no sound . ProtagonistA could not tear ProtagonistA's eyes away from them , and ProtagonistA did not want to make a sound , lest ProtagonistA break the spell . ProtagonistA stood there for what seemed like hours , until finally the moon began to rise . The geldings stirred and began to move . They walked slowly and gracefully towards the moon , and as they did , they transformed . Their bodies lengthened and their legs grew longer and more powerful . Their heads and tails appeared , and they became the most beautiful horses ProtagonistA had ever seen . The herd disappeared into the forest , and ProtagonistA was left alone , wondering if ProtagonistA had really seen what ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA had . 
Just leave ProtagonistA alone , please , ProtagonistB said . ProtagonistA might not be a good unicorn , but ProtagonistA 's not going anywhere . The other ponies in the herd did n't understand why ProtagonistB was so protective of ProtagonistA , but they left ProtagonistA alone anyway . ProtagonistA was grateful to ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's kindness , and ProtagonistA vowed to never leave ProtagonistB's side .

ProtagonistB was kind and sweet and ProtagonistB did n't take any of ProtagonistA's crap . ProtagonistB was also really pretty , which did n't hurt . ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA falling for ProtagonistB and , for the first time in ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA wanted to be a better person . ProtagonistA wanted to make ProtagonistB proud of ProtagonistA . And so ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA stopped getting into fights and ProtagonistA went back to school . ProtagonistA even got good grades . ProtagonistB was the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would do anything for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had saved ProtagonistA from a life of trouble and ProtagonistA would be forever grateful to ProtagonistB . 
It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA , was walking in the palace garden when the water droplet that had fallen from the sky the night before came in , bobbed down and out of the bush . ProtagonistA was so excited to see the water droplet again and followed it as it bounced around the garden . The water droplet was happy to have someone to play with and led ProtagonistA on a merry chase around the garden . Eventually , they both got tired and stopped to rest under a tree . They looked up at the sky and saw the sun shining through the leaves of the tree . They both smiled and agreed that it was a beautiful day . 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB's most recent folly . ProtagonistA was shocked and amazed at the perfectly calculated plot . ProtagonistA cried out ,  Wait , that 's a new plot ! ProtagonistA have to see this !  ProtagonistA ran over to where ProtagonistB was and watched as ProtagonistB executed ProtagonistB's plan . 
ProtagonistA do n't believe it ,   said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA sat down on the front steps of their house and looked down at the dusty back lot .   It had been a long time since anything had happened back there ,   and ProtagonistA was sure that the old abandoned house was nothing but a myth .   But ProtagonistA's friends had told ProtagonistA stories ,   and ProtagonistA was beginning to wonder if there was any truth to them .   Maybe ,   just maybe ,   there was something back there after all .   ProtagonistA was about to get up and investigate when ProtagonistA heard a noise from inside the house .   It sounded like someone was crying .   ProtagonistA slowly stood up and made ProtagonistA's way to the back door .   ProtagonistA was about to knock when ProtagonistA heard a voice from inside .    Please ,   do n't come in !    it said .   ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment ,   but then ProtagonistA made up ProtagonistA's mind .   ProtagonistA was going to find out what was going on inside that house . 
ProtagonistA was a smart little thing , almost two years old , who was not really a girl , but which people thought was a girl , because ProtagonistA would turn into a big good - for - nothing known as ' Sophia ' instead of into a girl , and ProtagonistA had been mistaken , they say , from the first moment when ProtagonistA was born , and ProtagonistA had believed everything ProtagonistA had been told . But one day , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was not really a girl , and ProtagonistA decided to turn into a boy instead . And from that day on , ProtagonistA was a boy , and ProtagonistA was happy . 
ProtagonistA had been a librarian for over forty years , and in that time ProtagonistA had seen a lot of things . But nothing had prepared ProtagonistA for the sight that greeted ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA walked into the library one morning . The table was covered in papers , and it was clear that somebody had been going through them in a hurry . ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head sadly .  What a sad sight , to lose one 's mind ,  ProtagonistA said . 
As soon as ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the bed and stared out the window . ProtagonistA had been having the same dream for weeks now and it was always the same . ProtagonistA would be in ProtagonistA's bed , in ProtagonistA's room and ProtagonistA would wake up to find ProtagonistA in a strange place . There would be people around ProtagonistA , but they would never speak to ProtagonistA . They would just go about their business as if ProtagonistA was n't there . ProtagonistA did n't know what the dream meant , but ProtagonistA was starting to get worried . ProtagonistA got up and went to the window , looking out at the city below . ProtagonistA had always loved the city , but now it just felt like a prison . ProtagonistA was trapped in ProtagonistA's room , in ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA did n't know how to escape . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going crazy . Suddenly , the door to ProtagonistA's room opened and ProtagonistB walked in . ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with a concerned expression and asked ProtagonistA what was wrong . ProtagonistA just shook ProtagonistA's head and said ProtagonistA did n't know . ProtagonistA could n't tell ProtagonistB about the dream , ProtagonistA did n't want ProtagonistB to think ProtagonistA was losing ProtagonistA's mind . ProtagonistB sat down on the bed and took ProtagonistA's hand . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately and that it was normal to have strange dreams . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA should try to relax and not worry so much . ProtagonistA nodded , but ProtagonistA did n't feel any better . ProtagonistA was still scared and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . 
Bob was wearing the same dress , and the same red dress , and the same black dress , and at the same time ProtagonistA was in the same place , in the same sudden moment , in the same instant , in the same place , in the same place , ProtagonistA was in the same place , ProtagonistA was wearing the same dress , and the same dress , and ProtagonistA was walking along , and ProtagonistA just kept walking , and ProtagonistA stopped in a little corner ( not much to go on there , there 's no way to tell where exactly ) and looked around for a second , and then laid ProtagonistA's head down on the hood of the car and leaned ProtagonistA's head against the passenger side window . 
ProtagonistA had been studying the chart for hours , and ProtagonistA was finally able to make sense of it .  There ProtagonistB is ,  ProtagonistA said , pointing to a small dot on the page .  ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been obsessed with finding ProtagonistB ever since ProtagonistA was a child , and now ProtagonistA had finally done it . ProtagonistA was going to be famous . ProtagonistA quickly packed ProtagonistA's things and set off for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was going to be the first person to find ProtagonistB in over two thousand years . ProtagonistA arrived at the coordinates ProtagonistA had found on the chart , and there ProtagonistB was : ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had done it . ProtagonistA quickly took some pictures and then made ProtagonistA's way back to civilization to share ProtagonistA's discovery with the world . ProtagonistA was going to be famous . 
Rolling over in pain , nodding slowly , looking up at the tree , eyes wide and eyes wide , ProtagonistB stared down at ProtagonistA , wondering if ProtagonistA was awake . ProtagonistA was lying on the ground , motionless . ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistA gently , but there was no response . ProtagonistB felt for a pulse , but could n't find one . ProtagonistB's eyes filled with tears as ProtagonistB realized ProtagonistA was gone . ProtagonistA had been with ProtagonistA since they were both young men , and now ProtagonistA was gone . ProtagonistB sat there for a long time , staring at ProtagonistA's body , until ProtagonistB finally got up and walked away . 
ProtagonistA was in a meeting with ProtagonistA's boss and the boss 's boss . They were both giving ProtagonistA a hard time about the project ProtagonistA was working on . ProtagonistA was getting frustrated . ProtagonistA did n't know what else to say , said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA took the stack of papers from the man on the right . ProtagonistA put them down on the table and started to leaf through them . ProtagonistA found the section ProtagonistA was looking for and started to read . ProtagonistA was so absorbed in what ProtagonistA was reading that ProtagonistA did n't notice when the two men left the room . 
ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had picked the pocket of a gentleman in London . ProtagonistA was getting tired and was ready to call it a day when ProtagonistA saw a farmhouse in the distance . ProtagonistA figured ProtagonistA could maybe get a bite to eat there and then be on ProtagonistA's way . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA saw a man and a woman sitting on the porch . They looked like they were wealthy , probably from the South of France . The man , who must have been William Samuel Lister , called out to ProtagonistA . Hello there , ProtagonistA . Are ProtagonistA looking for a place to stay for the night?Bob was hesitant , but ProtagonistA was tired and hungry , so ProtagonistA decided to go over to the farmhouse . Yes , sir , ProtagonistA am . ProtagonistA do n't have any money , but ProtagonistA can work for food . That 's not a problem ,  Mr. Lister said .  We have plenty of food here . Come on in . ProtagonistA was relieved and followed Mr. Lister into the farmhouse . ProtagonistA was shocked at how wealthy the family was . They must have been the descendants of a great lawyer or something . ProtagonistA was given a warm meal and a comfortable bed for the night . In the morning , Mr. Lister offered to pay ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's work . ProtagonistA was so grateful that ProtagonistA did n't even try to bargain for more . This was the best thing that had happened to ProtagonistA in a long time . ProtagonistA was finally starting to feel like things were going to get better for ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA came in a beaten and battered carriage and was carrying ProtagonistB across the country . ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's life , and this was just another adventure . ProtagonistB was injured and needed help , so ProtagonistA was going to take ProtagonistB to the nearest town . ProtagonistA did n't know what was going to happen , but ProtagonistA was ready for anything . 
ProtagonistA had seen true horror cross flying over a dozen times during ProtagonistA's time as head of the Department of Magical and Philosophical Research , but ProtagonistA never imagined that one might actually be made at the end of one 's life ! As ProtagonistA lay on ProtagonistA's deathbed , ProtagonistA could see the dark shape of the creature looming over ProtagonistA , its red eyes gleaming with hunger . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's time was up . There was a flash of light and then ProtagonistA was engulfed in darkness . 
ProtagonistA was standing in the doorway , ProtagonistA's dark hair up in a ponytail . ProtagonistA was wearing a black t - shirt and jeans and looked like ProtagonistA was ready to go . I was sitting on the couch , watching TV and eating popcorn . I had no idea what to say to ProtagonistA . I had no idea why ProtagonistA was here . Hi ,  I said , finally . Hi ,  ProtagonistA said .  Can ProtagonistA come in?Sure . I moved over on the couch and ProtagonistA sat down next to me . We sat there for a minute , not saying anything . Finally , ProtagonistA broke the silence . I'm here to talk to you about something ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm not sure how to say it , so ProtagonistA 'm just going to say it . I put my popcorn down and turned to ProtagonistA . I'm gay ,  ProtagonistA said .  And ProtagonistA like you . I was shocked . I had no idea that ProtagonistA was gay . I did n't know what to say . I'm sorry ,  I said .  I do n't know what to say . It 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA just wanted to tell you . ProtagonistA hope we can still be friends . Of course we can ,  I said . I was relieved that ProtagonistA had told me . I was glad that ProtagonistA was still my friend . And I was happy that I could still eat my popcorn . 
ProtagonistA was standing before him , ProtagonistA's hair aflame . It was an accident , of course . But still , it was quite a sight . ProtagonistA's hair was always well - groomed and styled , so to see it now , wild and out of control , was quite a shock . The fire was quickly extinguished , but the damage was done . ProtagonistA's hair was singed and frizzy , and ProtagonistA was absolutely mortified . ProtagonistA tried to laugh it off , but it was clear that ProtagonistA was deeply embarrassed . It was a long time before ProtagonistA felt confident enough to show ProtagonistA's face in public again . But eventually , ProtagonistA did , and ProtagonistA even managed to laugh about the incident . After all , it was just a case of bad luck . And besides , everyone knows that accidents happen . 
ProtagonistA was a volcanologist who had dedicated ProtagonistA's life to studying volcanoes . ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by them , and ProtagonistA loved nothing more than being in their presence . ProtagonistA had traveled all over the world to study them , and ProtagonistA had even written a few books on the subject . But there was one volcano that ProtagonistA had always dreamed of seeing up close : the great volcano . ProtagonistA finally got ProtagonistA's chance when ProtagonistA was invited to study the great volcano up close . ProtagonistA was thrilled , and ProtagonistA could n't wait to get started . But as ProtagonistA began ProtagonistA's studies , ProtagonistA started to notice something strange . The volcano seemed to be growing . ProtagonistA could n't believe it , but it was true . The great volcano was getting bigger . ProtagonistA alerted the other scientists , and they started to evacuate the area . But it was too late . The great volcano erupted , and ProtagonistA was killed in the explosion . 
It was a hot February day in the year 1826 , when ProtagonistA lay the body of ProtagonistB , to the sad and uncharitable . ProtagonistB had been bitten by a snake while they were out hunting and there was no antivenom . ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to save ProtagonistB , but it was too late . Now , ProtagonistA was all alone in the world . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner , but now ProtagonistA felt truly isolated . ProtagonistA had no one to turn to in ProtagonistA's time of need . ProtagonistA was tempted to just give up and end it all , but something inside ProtagonistA would n't let ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had to keep going , for ProtagonistB's sake . With a heavy heart , ProtagonistA continued on . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would want ProtagonistA to live and be happy , even if ProtagonistA could n't be there with ProtagonistB . 
There was once ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a very average looking guy . ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB and two kids . ProtagonistA worked at a factory . One day , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB was leaving ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB had found someone else . ProtagonistA was devastated .

ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had tried to win ProtagonistB back . 
ProtagonistA was having a great day . ProtagonistA had a delicious dinner , a handsome present for ProtagonistA's father , and the honor of being admitted to a certain gentleman 's house . ProtagonistA was glad the day was beautiful ; yet , ProtagonistA knew a prince of this kingdom must have a pretty house , a pretty air , and a pretty garden , or it was no good . 
ProtagonistA was facing away from the screen on the golden - tufted hill that bounded ProtagonistA's sea - walls , and the sunbeams streaming across the black sand stilled as it was . The light caught in ProtagonistA's hair , turning it to molten gold . ProtagonistA's shoulders were broad and strong , tapering to a slim waist . ProtagonistA was the picture of health and vigor , but there was a stillness in ProtagonistA , a peace that came from knowing who ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA could ever want , but it was n't enough . ProtagonistA was restless , searching for something more . ProtagonistA did n't know what it was , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to find it . ProtagonistA turned and looked at the screen . The world was a beautiful place , but it was also a cruel one . ProtagonistA had seen too much of the darkness , and ProtagonistA longed for the light . ProtagonistA did n't know where to find it , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep looking . 
ProtagonistA had been standing in the doorway all night , waiting for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had promised to come by and ProtagonistA was determined to wait for ProtagonistB . As the hours passed , ProtagonistA began to doubt ProtagonistB would ever show up . ProtagonistA was just about to give up and go to bed when ProtagonistA heard a noise outside . ProtagonistA looked out the window and saw ProtagonistB walking up the path . ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA ran out to meet ProtagonistB . They embraced each other and ProtagonistA invited ProtagonistB inside . They spent the night catching up and ProtagonistA was happy to finally have ProtagonistB back in ProtagonistA's life . 
In the early summer of 1831 , ProtagonistA was living in the vast old house of ProtagonistA's cousin , the lady Madame Bors ( the name of the owner of the property ) , in a part of Pannonward called the Park . The Park was a beautiful , sprawling estate with a huge house at its center . ProtagonistA had been living there for several months , and ProtagonistA loved it . ProtagonistA loved the peace and quiet of the Park , and ProtagonistA loved the company of ProtagonistB . One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the Park when ProtagonistA came across a small , abandoned house . It was in a state of disrepair , and it looked like it had been abandoned for years . ProtagonistA was curious , so ProtagonistA went inside . The house was dusty and musty , and it was clear that no one had been inside for a long time . ProtagonistA explored the house , and ProtagonistA found a secret room . Inside the secret room , ProtagonistA found a treasure trove of old coins and jewelry . ProtagonistA was thrilled , and ProtagonistA went back to the Park house to show ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's find . ProtagonistB was very excited when ProtagonistB saw the treasure that ProtagonistA had found . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the house ProtagonistA had found was actually an old pirate 's lair , and that the treasure must have belonged to a pirate who had hidden it there long ago . ProtagonistA was thrilled to have found such a treasure , and ProtagonistA was excited to tell ProtagonistA's friends all about it . 
ProtagonistA had only been a woman of ProtagonistA's word , when a magic box stood in ProtagonistA's front door , containing a box of eleven tiny little things , wrapped in a blue and white little envelope . ProtagonistA knew what they were , and ProtagonistA knew what they could do . ProtagonistA had been warned not to open the envelope , but ProtagonistA's curiosity was too strong . ProtagonistA carefully opened the envelope and took out one of the tiny things . It was a perfect little replica of a heart . ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA squeezed it , it would start beating . And so it did . 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had been trying to have a baby for years . They had been through all the fertility treatments and nothing had worked . They had just about given up hope when ProtagonistB found out ProtagonistB was pregnant . ProtagonistA was over the moon . ProtagonistA could n't believe it had finally happened . ProtagonistA was going to be a dad . ProtagonistB was happy too , but ProtagonistB was also a little scared . ProtagonistB was n't sure how ProtagonistB was going to handle being a mother . ProtagonistA reassured ProtagonistB that everything would be alright . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would be there for ProtagonistB's every step of the way . And that 's what ProtagonistA said when ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was pregnant . 
When ProtagonistA was eight years old , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to dinner and asked ProtagonistA whether ProtagonistA would like a dog . ProtagonistA thought about it for a while and then said that ProtagonistA would love a dog . ProtagonistB was so happy that ProtagonistB got ProtagonistA a dog the very next day .

One day , ProtagonistA was helping ProtagonistB with ProtagonistB's luggage when ProtagonistA slipped and fell , hitting ProtagonistA's head on a rock . ProtagonistA was taken to the hospital and was in a coma for weeks . When ProtagonistA finally woke up , ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's memory . ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistA was or where ProtagonistA came from . The only thing ProtagonistA could remember was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA did n't know ProtagonistB's name , but ProtagonistA was determined to find ProtagonistB . With the help of ProtagonistA's friends , ProtagonistA was able to find ProtagonistB and return ProtagonistB's luggage to ProtagonistB .

There was once ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was the daughter of Henry Vane , Earl of Essex , cousin of King James ; and , as is usual with them , ProtagonistA's father was a king . ProtagonistA was a very beautiful young woman , and ProtagonistA had a very kind heart . ProtagonistA was always helping others , and ProtagonistA was always trying to make everyone happy .

Two weeks ago , in the town on the Mississippi , there lived ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was always well - dressed and had a kind face . ProtagonistB was a simple man , who worked hard and never complained . The two men were friends , and they would often sit and talk together in the evenings . One evening , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was going to leave town . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had been offered a job in a faraway place and ProtagonistA was going to take it . ProtagonistB was sad to hear this news , but ProtagonistB wished ProtagonistA well . ProtagonistA left town the next day , and ProtagonistB never saw ProtagonistA again . A few weeks after ProtagonistA had left , ProtagonistB began to notice that strange things were happening in town . People were disappearing , and there was a feeling of fear in the air . ProtagonistB did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB had to find out what was going on . One night , ProtagonistB followed one of the townspeople who had been acting strange . ProtagonistB saw the man meet up with another man in a dark alley . ProtagonistB could n't hear what they were saying , but ProtagonistB saw the first man hand over a bundle of money . The next day , ProtagonistB went to the police and told them what ProtagonistB had seen . The police began to investigate , and soon they realized that ProtagonistA was behind the disappearances . They went to arrest ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA had already left town . ProtagonistB was a hero , and ProtagonistB was glad that ProtagonistB had been able to help solve the mystery . 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of ProtagonistA's bed , looking out at the booming blue sky . The sun was shining and the birds were singing . It was a beautiful day . ProtagonistA was happy . ProtagonistA had just gotten out of bed and was about to start ProtagonistA's day . Everything was going to be great . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a loud noise . It sounded like something had exploded . ProtagonistA got up to see what it was . When ProtagonistA looked out the window , ProtagonistA saw a huge cloud of smoke . It was coming from the direction of the city . ProtagonistA knew that something terrible had happened . ProtagonistA had to find out what it was . ProtagonistA got dressed quickly and ran out of ProtagonistA's house . ProtagonistA was going to the city to find out what had happened . 
The first time ProtagonistA bought ProtagonistB the farm ProtagonistB lived on , it was to construct a house for ProtagonistA's cousin 's pet phoenix . The phoenix , a beautiful creature with golden feathers , needed a place to live that would be safe from harm . And so , ProtagonistA built a house for the phoenix on ProtagonistA's farm . The phoenix was very grateful and flew around ProtagonistA's farm , singing beautiful songs . Every time the sun set , the phoenix would fly into the house and perch on the highest point , watching over the farm . 
ProtagonistA was a bright young boy , but ProtagonistA was always a little bit different from the other kids at school . ProtagonistA had bright red hair , and bright blue eyes , and ProtagonistA always seemed to be looking at the world in a different way . One day , when ProtagonistA went to school , there was ProtagonistB in the school room . But ProtagonistB did n't look like ProtagonistA at all . ProtagonistB had dark hair , and dark eyes , and ProtagonistB always seemed to be looking at the world in a different way . ProtagonistA did n't know what to make of it , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were different . 
ProtagonistA had been sleeping all that time and was still sleeping when ProtagonistA began to cry . It was a deep , guttural cry that shook ProtagonistA's entire body . The sound was so loud and so unexpected that it woke ProtagonistB up from ProtagonistB's own sleep . ProtagonistB sat up in bed and looked at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB did n't know what to do , so ProtagonistB just sat there and watched ProtagonistA . After a few minutes , ProtagonistA's crying subsided and ProtagonistA fell back into a deep sleep . ProtagonistB lay down and tried to go back to sleep , but ProtagonistB could n't . ProtagonistB was too disturbed by what ProtagonistB had seen . 
ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA had seen war , famine , and death . ProtagonistA had seen people suffer and die . ProtagonistA had seen the worst of humanity . But ProtagonistA had also seen the best of humanity . ProtagonistA had seen people help each other in times of need . ProtagonistA had seen people come together in times of crisis . ProtagonistA had seen the human spirit triumph over adversity . ProtagonistA had been through a lot , but ProtagonistA had never been through anything like this . ProtagonistA had been through hell . ProtagonistA had seen things that no one should ever have to see . ProtagonistA had seen people do things that no one should ever have to do . ProtagonistA had seen the worst of humanity , and it had scarred ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistA was a survivor . ProtagonistA had survived war , famine , and death . ProtagonistA had survived the worst of humanity . And ProtagonistA would survive this . 
ProtagonistA stood on the doorstep of ProtagonistA's house , watching ProtagonistB , drive into the town with ProtagonistB's wife . It was a beautiful day and the sun was shining . ProtagonistA felt a pang of jealousy as ProtagonistA watched the two of them drive off together . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA should be happy for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit left out . ProtagonistA went back inside the house and sat down at the kitchen table . ProtagonistA was lost in thought when ProtagonistA heard a car pull up outside . ProtagonistA got up to see who it was and was surprised to see ProtagonistB getting out of the car . I forgot ProtagonistB's wallet ,  ProtagonistB said sheepishly . That 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said , trying to hide the relief in ProtagonistA's voice . I'm sorry I left ProtagonistA alone ,  ProtagonistB said .  Do ProtagonistA want to come into town with us?No , that 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA 'll just stay here . Are ProtagonistA sure ?  ProtagonistB asked . Yeah , ProtagonistA 'm sure ,  ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistB hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistB got back in the car and drove off . ProtagonistA watched them go , feeling a little bit lonely . 
ProtagonistA is sitting down by the window , reading a book which ProtagonistA has brought into ProtagonistA's room , and without speaking . The book is called  The Catcher in the Rye  and it is ProtagonistA's favorite book . ProtagonistA has read it many times before , but ProtagonistA always enjoys reading it again . It is a story about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB is a very misunderstood character , and ProtagonistA can relate to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistB is someone who is just like ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had always wanted a man with blond hair , but when ProtagonistA was eight the first color on ProtagonistA's face changed into something untidy and unpleasant . When ProtagonistA was sixteen , the second color started to change , and by the time ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA's hair was an entirely different color . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's identity . ProtagonistA did n't feel like ProtagonistA belonged anywhere . ProtagonistA did n't feel like ProtagonistA was attractive anymore . ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA was invisible . One day , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was so handsome and ProtagonistA could n't take ProtagonistA's eyes off of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA felt a stirring in ProtagonistA's heart and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was the man ProtagonistA had been waiting for . ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistB's hair was n't blond anymore , ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB for who ProtagonistB was . 
ProtagonistA turned into the white stucco garden where ProtagonistA was working and then into the street . The sky was blue with the crying of birds , and the light of the city . ProtagonistA had been working in the garden for hours , and ProtagonistA's back was sore . ProtagonistA was looking forward to a cold beer and a hot shower . As ProtagonistA walked down the street , ProtagonistA saw a group of young men hanging out on the corner . They were rough - looking , and ProtagonistA knew they were up to no good . ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , but they called out to ProtagonistA . Hey , ProtagonistA ! We want ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA tried to ignore them , but they were getting closer . ProtagonistA was about to run when ProtagonistA felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's back . ProtagonistA fell to the ground , and the last thing ProtagonistA saw was the group of men standing over ProtagonistA , laughing . 
ProtagonistA was called ' calypso , ' and was carried away in the arms of ProtagonistA's mother , who , however , was not exactly like an angel ; but perhaps like a god , the same kind of god , as the sun and the moon and the stars and the whole galaxy . ProtagonistB had blue eyes , brown hair , and a florid face . ProtagonistB was tall and slender , with a long white beard and hair that was trimmed and frothy - blond . ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's only child , and ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA dearly . ProtagonistA was a happy child , always laughing and playing . ProtagonistA was never naughty , and always did as ProtagonistA was told . ProtagonistB was very proud of ProtagonistA . One day , when ProtagonistA was five years old , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to the park . They walked hand in hand , and ProtagonistA skipped along happily . Suddenly , a gust of wind blew ProtagonistA's hat off ProtagonistA's head and into a tree . ProtagonistB climbed up the tree to retrieve it , but ProtagonistB slipped and fell . ProtagonistA ran to ProtagonistB , crying and screaming for help . A crowd gathered , and someone called for an ambulance . ProtagonistB was taken to the hospital , but ProtagonistB died a few days later . ProtagonistA was heartbroken . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA would go on without ProtagonistB . But ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistA a gift : ProtagonistB's love for life . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had to be strong , and ProtagonistA slowly began to heal . ProtagonistA started to laugh and play again , and ProtagonistA even went back to the park . Now , every time ProtagonistA visits the park , ProtagonistA thinks of ProtagonistB and the wonderful times they had together . ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistB is always with ProtagonistA , watching over ProtagonistA from the stars . 
There 's ProtagonistA , and if ProtagonistB follow ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB should catch ProtagonistA , said ProtagonistB , but seemed not to be very careful . ProtagonistB was speeding down the road , following ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was driving erratically , and ProtagonistB was having a hard time keeping up . Eventually , ProtagonistB lost sight of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB pulled over to the side of the road , frustrated . ProtagonistB was about to give up when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA's car pulled over on the side of the road ahead of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB smiled and pulled over behind ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was a simple man who loved the way things were done . ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life and did n't want for anything more . That is until ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was different than anyone ProtagonistA had ever met before . ProtagonistB was kind and caring and ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA that there was more to life than just the way things were done . ProtagonistA fell in love with ProtagonistB and they were married soon after . They were happy together and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never be content with just the way things were done again . 
ProtagonistA lay with ProtagonistA's legs crossed , rocking back and forth . ProtagonistA was in pain , and ProtagonistA knew it . The doctors had told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA's cancer was terminal , and that ProtagonistA only had a few months to live . ProtagonistA had been in and out of the hospital for the past year , and ProtagonistA's body was weak . ProtagonistA was tired of fighting , and ProtagonistA just wanted to let go . As ProtagonistA rocked back and forth , ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's wife , and ProtagonistA's children . ProtagonistA thought about all the things ProtagonistA had done , and all the things ProtagonistA had yet to do . ProtagonistA was at peace with ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew that it was time to let go . 
 Our granda said ,  said ProtagonistB ,  that ProtagonistA was the daughter of ProtagonistC ; but ProtagonistA lived before that , and has been dead many years .  ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head and sighed .  It is a shame , such a shame . ProtagonistA was a good man , ProtagonistA was . A kind man . ProtagonistA would have made a good husband , ProtagonistB think . The old woman 's eyes grew distant and ProtagonistB began to speak softly , as if ProtagonistB were talking to ProtagonistB .  They say that when ProtagonistC was just a girl , ProtagonistC was very beautiful . All the young men in the empire wanted to marry ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistD would only allow ProtagonistC to marry a man who could bring ProtagonistD the head of a dragon . Many men tried , but none succeeded . Then , one day , ProtagonistA came to the palace and presented the head of a dragon to ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD was so pleased that ProtagonistD immediately allowed ProtagonistA to marry ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB paused and shook ProtagonistB's head again .  But it was not to be . Just a few days after the wedding , ProtagonistA was killed in a hunting accident . ProtagonistC was heartbroken . ProtagonistC never married again and ProtagonistC never had any children . ProtagonistC ruled the empire for many years , but ProtagonistC was never the same after ProtagonistA died . ProtagonistB sighed and fell silent . ProtagonistC seemed to have forgotten that ProtagonistB was even there . ProtagonistB quietly got up and left , leaving ProtagonistC to ProtagonistC's memories . 
ProtagonistA's parents had been through a lot in their lives . They had both grown up in poverty and had to drop out of school to work to support their families . When they met , they were both working two jobs and barely making ends meet . But they fell in love and decided to start a family . They had ProtagonistA , and they were determined to give ProtagonistA a better life than they had . So , each morning ProtagonistA rose to school and ProtagonistA's parents dragged their loaded and battered car into the driveway . They worked hard to make sure ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA needed , even if it meant sacrificing their own needs . ProtagonistA was a bright student and worked hard to get good grades . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's parents were counting on ProtagonistA to make something of ProtagonistA . And ProtagonistA was determined to make them proud . One day , after ProtagonistA had graduated from college , ProtagonistA came home to find ProtagonistA's parents ' car gone from the driveway . ProtagonistA went inside and found them sitting at the kitchen table , smiling at ProtagonistA . We sold the car ,  ProtagonistA's father said .  It 's time for us to retire . ProtagonistA was so happy to see ProtagonistA's parents finally getting to enjoy their retirement . They had sacrificed so much for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was grateful . ProtagonistA knew that their love and support had helped ProtagonistA succeed in life . 
ProtagonistA had never seen anything like China before . ProtagonistA was mesmerized by the sights and sounds of the bustling streets and the beautiful temples . ProtagonistA instantly fell in love with the country and its people . ProtagonistB had been a donkey driver in China for many years . ProtagonistB had always wanted to see ProtagonistA grow up and have a better life than ProtagonistB had . So , when ProtagonistA was old enough , ProtagonistA set off with Yede , ProtagonistB's donkey , to the Chinese orphanage where ProtagonistA had been born . The journey was long and difficult , but ProtagonistA persevered . Finally , ProtagonistA arrived at the orphanage . ProtagonistA was immediately taken in by the kind staff and the other children . ProtagonistA quickly adapted to life at the orphanage . ProtagonistA loved learning about Chinese culture and history . ProtagonistA was especially fascinated by the stories of the great emperor Qin Shihuangdi . One day , ProtagonistB came to visit ProtagonistA at the orphanage . ProtagonistB was so proud of ProtagonistA and the man ProtagonistA had become . ProtagonistA had found a home in China and was destined to give birth to an immortal emperor . 
ProtagonistA had had a tough day . ProtagonistA had been walking along the banks of the Thames , in a sort of drunken stupor , when ProtagonistA slipped and fell into the water . ProtagonistA struggled to get out , but the current was too strong . ProtagonistA was pulled under and drowned . 
In those days no man had any serious business to do with ProtagonistA , but , for some odd reason , at the age of eighteen ProtagonistA seemed to have gained much more importance than in any other part of ProtagonistA's family . ProtagonistA was always the one who was sent on errands , or to do the grocery shopping , and ProtagonistA's parents always had a serious talk with ProtagonistA before making any decisions . Even ProtagonistA's grandparents seemed to defer to ProtagonistA more than anyone else . It was as if ProtagonistA was the head of the family , even though ProtagonistA was the youngest . One day , ProtagonistA was sent to town to pick up some supplies for the farm . ProtagonistA was gone all day , and when ProtagonistA finally returned , ProtagonistA was carrying a large bundle under ProtagonistA's arm . ProtagonistA's family gathered around ProtagonistA , eager to see what ProtagonistA had brought back . ProtagonistA unrolled the bundle , and inside was a beautiful golden necklace . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had found it lying in the street , and that it must have belonged to a rich lady who had lost it . ProtagonistA's family was amazed at ProtagonistA's find , and they all agreed that it must have been meant for ProtagonistA to find . From then on , ProtagonistA was known as the lucky one , and ProtagonistA's family always looked to ProtagonistA for guidance and advice . ProtagonistA was the one who always seemed to bring them good luck . 
A fair - faced , blue - eyed girl with a soft , slightly lisping voice , the daughter of a Brooklyn market girl and a remorseless explorer , who had short , spiky black hair and a small , round face , and was accustomed to be the last one to board the little white train at the west end of the Bronx , or at least to begin ProtagonistA's journey without any companion except ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB had been on the train for what felt like hours , though it was probably only minutes . ProtagonistB was the only passenger in the car , and the only person ProtagonistB had seen since boarding was ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was sitting in the front of the car , and ProtagonistB was in the back . ProtagonistB was getting sleepy , and was just about to doze off when ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistC get up and walk towards ProtagonistB . Excuse ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistC said ,  but ProtagonistC could n't help but notice that ProtagonistB 're the only one in this car . ProtagonistC was just wondering if ProtagonistB 're okay . The girl sat up and rubbed ProtagonistB's eyes .  ProtagonistB 'm fine ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'm just waiting for ProtagonistB's stop . Oh , okay ,  ProtagonistC said . ProtagonistC paused for a moment , as if ProtagonistC wanted to say something else , but then ProtagonistC turned and walked back to ProtagonistC's seat . ProtagonistB leaned ProtagonistB's head against the window and watched the darkness outside . ProtagonistB was getting sleepy again when ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistC get up and walk towards ProtagonistB . Excuse ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistC said again ,  but ProtagonistC was just wondering if ProtagonistB 're sure ProtagonistB 're okay . ProtagonistB 've been sitting there for a while , and ProtagonistC just wanted to make sure ProtagonistB 're not lost or anything . I'm fine ,  ProtagonistB said , a little more forcefully this time .  ProtagonistB 'm just waiting for ProtagonistB's stop . Okay ,  ProtagonistC said . ProtagonistC paused again , but this time ProtagonistC did n't turn around .  ProtagonistC's name 's Bob , by the way . What 's yours?Mary ,  ProtagonistB said . Nice to meet ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistC said .  ProtagonistC hope ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's stop soon . With that , ProtagonistC turned and walked back to ProtagonistC's seat . ProtagonistB leaned ProtagonistB's head against the window again and watched the darkness outside . ProtagonistB was just about to doze off when ProtagonistB heard the train come to a stop . ProtagonistB sat up and looked out the window , and saw that they were at ProtagonistB's stop . ProtagonistB got up and grabbed ProtagonistB's bag , then turned to ProtagonistC .  Thank ProtagonistC for talking to ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB appreciate it . No problem ,  ProtagonistC said .  ProtagonistC just wanted to make sure ProtagonistB were okay . Have a good night , ProtagonistB . You too , ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistB said . ProtagonistB got off the train and watched it pull away , then turned and walked towards ProtagonistB's home . 
ProtagonistA was not what ProtagonistA had heard ProtagonistA was supposed to be . ProtagonistA was supposed to be a great guy , a fun guy , a guy that everyone wanted to be around . But ProtagonistA was none of those things . ProtagonistA was a boring guy , a guy that no one wanted to be around . ProtagonistA was the kind of guy that you would never want to talk to . 
ProtagonistA had been working at the same office for 5 years . ProtagonistA had started to feel like ProtagonistA was in a rut and needed a change . When ProtagonistA walked out of the office for the last time , ProtagonistA felt a certain relief . It was time for ProtagonistA to start fresh and ProtagonistA was excited for the new opportunities that awaited ProtagonistA . 
Once upon a time there lived ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a very happy man . ProtagonistA had a great job , a beautiful wife , and two lovely children . However , one day ProtagonistA's world came crashing down . ProtagonistA was fired from ProtagonistA's job , ProtagonistA's wife left ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's children were taken away from ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA was lost and alone . However , one day ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was kind , caring , and ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA get back on ProtagonistA's feet . ProtagonistA was grateful to ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA soon fell in love with ProtagonistB . They got married and they were happy ever after . 
ProtagonistA was nothing more than a mortal , and ProtagonistA had enough friends and lovers who ProtagonistA could trust . But one day , ProtagonistA's life changed forever . ProtagonistA was visited by a god , who told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was chosen to be the protector of humanity . From that day forward , ProtagonistA was blessed with superhuman strength , speed , and agility . ProtagonistA was also given a magical sword , which ProtagonistA used to defend the world from evil . ProtagonistA became a legend , and ProtagonistA's friends and lovers became ProtagonistA's faithful followers . Together , they fought against the forces of darkness and protected the innocent . ProtagonistA's life was changed forever , but ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistA's humble beginnings . 
The Tudor house has been a story that has been told in many different ways from the time of its beginnings . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's heir , the Princess Mrs. Victoria , died , and the story was told in a different way . Some say that the Tudor house was a cursed house , while others say that it was a house of great wealth and power . No matter what the story is , the Tudor house has been a part of history for many years . 
When we first met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA had never seen any men . ProtagonistA was a bit intimidated at first , but ProtagonistA soon warmed up to us . ProtagonistA was a shy guy , but once ProtagonistA got to know us , ProtagonistA was a lot of fun . ProtagonistA was always up for a good time , and ProtagonistA was always the life of the party . ProtagonistA was a great friend , and we all loved ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA used to love ProtagonistA's boots , but they were as old as the southern mud and ProtagonistA hated the way they made ProtagonistA's feet feel so frail . ProtagonistA decided to go on a quest to find new boots that would make ProtagonistA feel young and spry again . After searching high and low , ProtagonistA finally found the perfect pair . They were made of the softest leather and fit ProtagonistA like a glove . Now , every time ProtagonistA puts them on , ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA can conquer the world . 
ProtagonistA was a little over a mile away , head down , arms rolled in ProtagonistA's lap . ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how it had led ProtagonistA to this point . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner , never really fitting in with any group of friends . ProtagonistA had always been content with ProtagonistA's own company and never felt the need for anyone else . But now , as ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the cliff , looking out at the vastness of the ocean , ProtagonistA felt a loneliness like ProtagonistA had never felt before . ProtagonistA contemplated jumping off the cliff and ending it all , but ProtagonistA just could n't bring ProtagonistA to do it . ProtagonistA sat there for hours , until the sun began to set , and then ProtagonistA finally got up and walked back to ProtagonistA's car . 
Over the last three years , when I have been able to visit the house where ProtagonistA fathomed ProtagonistA's dreams , ProtagonistA has changed little . The living room is still full of ProtagonistA's books , ProtagonistA's favorite chair by the window is still there , and ProtagonistA's ashes are still on the mantle . ProtagonistB , has kept everything the same , as if ProtagonistB is waiting for ProtagonistA to come back . I know ProtagonistB still misses ProtagonistA terribly . It was only three years ago that ProtagonistA passed away , but it feels like a lifetime . I remember the day ProtagonistA told me ProtagonistA's dreams . We were sitting in ProtagonistA's living room , and ProtagonistA was telling me about all the places ProtagonistA wanted to see and the things ProtagonistA wanted to do . ProtagonistA had this sparkle in ProtagonistA's eye , and I could tell ProtagonistA was truly passionate about life . I was so inspired by ProtagonistA . Now , every time I visit ProtagonistA's house , I feel like ProtagonistA is still there with me , living ProtagonistA's dreams . 
ProtagonistA had just lost ProtagonistA's job and ProtagonistA's girlfriend had just left ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was feeling pretty down on ProtagonistA's luck . So when ProtagonistA's friend came up to ProtagonistA and said ,  Nothing good ever happens without a cause ,  ProtagonistA could n't help but agree . ProtagonistA's friend was right - nothing good ever happens without a cause . If only ProtagonistA could figure out what the cause was in ProtagonistA's own life , maybe things would start to look up for ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA's life changed the day ProtagonistB died . It was an accident , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like it was ProtagonistA's fault . ProtagonistB had always been the more impulsive one , but ProtagonistA had always been the one to hold ProtagonistB back . If only ProtagonistA had let ProtagonistB go , ProtagonistB might still be alive . ProtagonistA was inconsolable after the funeral . ProtagonistA blamed ProtagonistA for ProtagonistB's death and felt like ProtagonistA did n't deserve to live . ProtagonistA was tempted to end ProtagonistA's own life , but something stopped ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that ProtagonistB was still with ProtagonistA , somehow . As the days went by , ProtagonistA started to notice strange things happening . ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistA in places ProtagonistA did n't remember going to , and ProtagonistA had strange dreams . In one dream , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was now immortal . At first , ProtagonistA thought it was just ProtagonistA's mind playing tricks on ProtagonistA , but the more ProtagonistA thought about it , the more ProtagonistA realized it was true . ProtagonistA was terrified at first , but ProtagonistA slowly started to accept ProtagonistA's new reality . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't tell anyone about it , because they would never believe ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA had to be careful , because if ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA would stay dead . ProtagonistA started to live ProtagonistA's life differently after that . ProtagonistA was more careful and deliberate in everything ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA also started to appreciate life more , because ProtagonistA knew how precious it was . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to make the most of ProtagonistA's time , because ProtagonistA now had eternity . 
The court papers in the office of ProtagonistA , dated May 6 , 1795 , showed that ProtagonistB , had put the cookery of ProtagonistA on ice , in order to prevent any further vanity . ProtagonistA was a simple man , and ProtagonistA did n't understand why ProtagonistB would do such a thing . ProtagonistA had always been a good cook , and ProtagonistA had never done anything to deserve this . ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's palace , and ProtagonistA begged ProtagonistB to lift the ban on ProtagonistA's cookery . ProtagonistB was a cold woman , and ProtagonistB refused . ProtagonistA pleaded with ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB would not listen . ProtagonistA went home , and ProtagonistA was heartbroken . ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do . ProtagonistA loved cooking , and it was ProtagonistA's passion . Without it , ProtagonistA felt lost . ProtagonistA decided to take matters into ProtagonistA's own hands . ProtagonistA snuck into ProtagonistB's palace kitchen and ProtagonistA cooked a meal . It was a beautiful meal , and it was perfect . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be impressed . The next day , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's office , and ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB the meal ProtagonistA had cooked . ProtagonistB was shocked . ProtagonistB had never seen such a beautiful meal . ProtagonistB lifted the ban on ProtagonistA's cookery , and ProtagonistB apologized for ever doubting ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a great cook , and ProtagonistA went on to have a successful career . ProtagonistA was loved by all , and ProtagonistA was always remembered for ProtagonistA's delicious food . 
ProtagonistA was walking towards the door of ProtagonistB's room , shaking ProtagonistA's head . It had been a long day , and ProtagonistA was just ready to relax . But as ProtagonistA got closer to the door , ProtagonistA could hear voices coming from inside . It sounded like ProtagonistB was on the phone , and ProtagonistB was crying . ProtagonistA paused for a moment , not sure what to do . Should ProtagonistA just go in and comfort ProtagonistB ? Or give ProtagonistB some space ? ProtagonistA decided to go in . As ProtagonistA walked in , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on the bed , phone in hand . ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with tears in ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistA sat down next to ProtagonistB and put ProtagonistA's arm around ProtagonistB .  It 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm here for ProtagonistB .  
ProtagonistA stood there , though ProtagonistA was not quite sure why . The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was going to bed , but now ProtagonistA was in some sort of strange room . The walls were made of stone , and there was a small window high up that let in a sliver of light . ProtagonistA could hear a faint noise coming from somewhere , and ProtagonistA started to walk towards it . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that the noise was someone crying . ProtagonistA came to a door and slowly opened it . Inside was ProtagonistB , huddled in a corner . ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with terror in ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA had gotten here , or where here even was . But ProtagonistA did know that ProtagonistA could n't just leave ProtagonistB here by ProtagonistB . So ProtagonistA sat down and tried to comfort ProtagonistB the best ProtagonistA could . 
The antique raven with which the little housemaids had cast a delighted guess at the location of ProtagonistA , was now perched on the masthead of the silver boat that carried ProtagonistA to the small town of Bucklemore . As the boat drew closer and closer to the town , the raven 's eyes grew brighter and brighter with excitement . It knew that it would soon be reunited with ProtagonistA . 
In the year of 1358 , during the reign of ProtagonistB , was born ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was born into a poor family and never had much growing up . When ProtagonistA was old enough , ProtagonistA started working in the fields to help support ProtagonistA's family . ProtagonistA worked hard every day , rain or shine . One day , while ProtagonistA was working , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling to ProtagonistA . It was the voice of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had heard of ProtagonistA's hard work and wanted to reward ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to come to the palace and work for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was so excited and could n't believe it was happening . ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things and went to the palace to start ProtagonistA's new life . 
ProtagonistA had been in the room for days , maybe weeks . ProtagonistA was n't sure . All ProtagonistA knew was that the walls were closing in on ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was going stir crazy . ProtagonistA had begged , pleaded , and even threatened the guards , but they would n't let ProtagonistA leave . Finally , ProtagonistA had given up . ProtagonistA was resigned to ProtagonistA's fate , whatever that may be . But then , out of the blue , the guards came to ProtagonistA's cell and told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA could stay longer . They did n't say why , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA was just happy to be out of that tiny room . ProtagonistA was given a bed and some basic amenities , and for the first time in a long time , ProtagonistA felt like a human being again . ProtagonistA did n't know how long ProtagonistA would be allowed to stay , but ProtagonistA was grateful for every second . 
It was a pity to see ProtagonistA's head , ProtagonistB , all throbbing and squirmy , ProtagonistA's eyes so half - closed , said ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's sweetest voice .  ProtagonistB 'm so sorry , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said ,  but ProtagonistB just ca n't help it . It 's been like this for days , and the doctors do n't know what to do . They say it 's some sort of infection , but they ca n't seem to get rid of it .  ProtagonistA just nodded , too exhausted to speak . ProtagonistA had been in and out of the hospital for weeks , and it was taking its toll on ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA 'll be all right ,  ProtagonistA said finally .  ProtagonistA just need some rest .  And with that , ProtagonistA turned over and went to sleep . 
ProtagonistA had finally decided to carve a story for ProtagonistA's dead husband . It had been years since ProtagonistA's husband had passed away , and ProtagonistA had never been able to bring ProtagonistA to do it . But now , finally , ProtagonistA was ready . ProtagonistA sat down at ProtagonistA's kitchen table with a block of wood and a carving knife , and ProtagonistA began to carve . ProtagonistA carved a story of love and loss , of happiness and sorrow . ProtagonistA carved it all into the wood , pouring ProtagonistA's heart and soul into it . When ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistA stepped back and looked at ProtagonistA's work . It was beautiful , and it told the story of ProtagonistA's husband 's life perfectly . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's husband would have loved it . ProtagonistA placed the carving on the mantle , and ProtagonistA went to bed with a smile on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's husband was with ProtagonistA , and that ProtagonistA was at peace . 
In truth , for all the things ProtagonistA had , no one expected ProtagonistA to be a mother . It was a hot summer day and ProtagonistA was out in the yard , tending to ProtagonistA's garden . ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the bushes and went to investigate . There , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB , meowing pitifully . ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB in and nursed ProtagonistB back to health . ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB's Mittens and ProtagonistB became ProtagonistA's best friend . Over the years , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB grew old together . When ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistA was heartbroken . ProtagonistA never expected to love ProtagonistB so much , but ProtagonistB was the best thing that ever happened to ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA 's been acting like a mother ever since I left . ProtagonistA 's put a few things in ProtagonistA's mouth and ProtagonistA 's gone very much as a mother . I think ProtagonistA 's trying to take care of me and my children . ProtagonistA 's always been a great father , but now ProtagonistA 's acting like a mother . It 's really sweet . 
ProtagonistA was four years old when ProtagonistA heard the news that ProtagonistC had been murdered . It was a cold winter day and ProtagonistA was inside playing with ProtagonistA's toys . ProtagonistB was in the kitchen cooking dinner when the doorbell rang . ProtagonistB answered the door and ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB talking to someone in a low voice . ProtagonistA could n't hear what they were saying , but ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was upset . After a few minutes , ProtagonistB came into the living room and sat down next to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC had been killed and that ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistC again . ProtagonistA was very sad and cried for a long time . 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA , and so ProtagonistA says , but ProtagonistA's family did not believe ProtagonistA was really who ProtagonistA looked and spoke like . ProtagonistA's father always said that ProtagonistA was just a phase that ProtagonistA was going through and that ProtagonistA would grow out of it . But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was not just going through a phase ; ProtagonistA was who ProtagonistA was . One day , ProtagonistA decided to leave ProtagonistA's family 's home and go out into the world to find others like ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA eventually found a community of people who accepted ProtagonistA for who ProtagonistA was and ProtagonistA finally felt at home . 
ProtagonistB partook of ProtagonistA's tea , an infusion of which was prepared for ProtagonistA by the hand of the cook of the kitchen . It was a most delicious tea , and ProtagonistB was quite pleased with it . ProtagonistA , however , seemed to be in a hurry and did not drink more than a few sips before setting ProtagonistA's cup down and getting up from the table .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA must be going now ,  ProtagonistA said .  It was nice to meet ProtagonistB .  And with that , ProtagonistA was gone . 
ProtagonistA stood on the beach , looking out at the sea . ProtagonistA had seen many things in ProtagonistA's life , but nothing had prepared ProtagonistA for the sight that greeted ProtagonistA now . The water was red with blood , and the bodies of the dead floated in the waves . ProtagonistA's face was black with the blood of the humans ProtagonistA had killed . ProtagonistA knew that this was the end . There was no way ProtagonistA could survive this . But ProtagonistA had to try . ProtagonistA turned and ran into the water . 
It was Sunday morning when ProtagonistA came into the living room of ProtagonistA's house in the Avenue of the Thames . ProtagonistA had just returned from a weekend away and was looking forward to a quiet day at home . However , ProtagonistA was surprised to find ProtagonistA's wife and children already up and about . ProtagonistA's wife told ProtagonistA that they had been up for hours and had already had breakfast . ProtagonistA was amazed at how early they had gotten up on a Sunday morning . 
ProtagonistA's head was pounding as ProtagonistA slowly opened ProtagonistA's eyes . The first words ProtagonistA heard were ,  ProtagonistB is dead .  ProtagonistA could n't believe it . ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's best friend . They had been through everything together . ProtagonistA tried to get up , but ProtagonistA felt so weak . ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was in a hospital room . ProtagonistA must have been in a coma . The doctors said that ProtagonistA would n't be able to speak or move ever again . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA wanted to cry , but ProtagonistA could n't even do that . The only thing ProtagonistA could do was think about ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA climbed down into the water , where ProtagonistA had been stripped of all ProtagonistA's clothing , and stood there , ProtagonistA's mind reeling . ProtagonistA had been in the water for hours , and ProtagonistA's body was numb . ProtagonistA could barely move ProtagonistA's arms or legs . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die soon . ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's life and all the things ProtagonistA had done . ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's family and friends . ProtagonistA was sorry ProtagonistA would never see them again . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let go . 
The first time ProtagonistB pulled ProtagonistA out of the park , ProtagonistA was in a tangle of newts , ProtagonistA's body in full view of the other newts . ProtagonistA was a mess , ProtagonistA's scales all over the place , and ProtagonistA's eyes were bulging out of ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB had to act fast . ProtagonistB grabbed ProtagonistA by the tail and yanked ProtagonistA out of the park . The other newts hissed and retreated back into the undergrowth . ProtagonistB laid ProtagonistA down on the ground and tried to untangle ProtagonistA . After a few minutes , ProtagonistB managed to get ProtagonistA's body back into some semblance of order . ProtagonistA was still alive , but ProtagonistA was in a bad way . ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB had to get ProtagonistA to a hospital . ProtagonistB picked ProtagonistA up and started to run . 
ProtagonistA was frowning when ProtagonistA heard the blast , but ProtagonistA had n't seen anything yet . ProtagonistA slowly turned ProtagonistA's head to the left , and then to the right , trying to see what had caused the explosion . But all ProtagonistA saw was smoke and debris . ProtagonistA started to run towards the site of the blast , but ProtagonistA was stopped by a police officer .  ProtagonistA ca n't go any closer , ProtagonistA . It 's not safe .  ProtagonistA nodded and stepped back . ProtagonistA could n't believe what had happened . There was no way that anyone could have survived that explosion . 
ProtagonistA leaned into the glow of the fire , ProtagonistA's hands clasped behind ProtagonistA . It should be fine , Dr. Sandor . ProtagonistA knows exactly what ProtagonistA 's doing . ProtagonistA 's been planning this for months , ever since ProtagonistA found out about the experimental treatment . If it works , ProtagonistA 'll be the first person in the world to be cured of ProtagonistA's rare disease . If it does n't ... well , ProtagonistA 's prepared for that too . ProtagonistA knows the risks , but ProtagonistA 's willing to take them . After all , what 's the alternative ? Living a life of pain and suffering , slowly withering away until there 's nothing left ? No , ProtagonistA 's not going to let that happen . ProtagonistA 's going to fight for ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA 's going to win . 
ProtagonistA's wedding was a happy occasion . The air in the room was clear and free from the mists of the past . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's new wife were surrounded by their families and friends , all of whom were happy for the couple . The wedding was a beautiful event , and the reception afterwards was a joyous celebration . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's wife danced the night away , and all of their guests had a wonderful time . 
Before ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistA's life to be the best it could be , and ProtagonistA knew that it would only be the best possible if ProtagonistA made it that way . So , ProtagonistA set out to do just that . ProtagonistA started by making a list of all the things ProtagonistA wanted to do and see in ProtagonistA's life . Then , ProtagonistA started crossing them off one by one . ProtagonistA traveled to all the places ProtagonistA wanted to see , ProtagonistA did all the things ProtagonistA wanted to do , and ProtagonistA made sure to spend time with the people ProtagonistA loved most . In the end , ProtagonistA died happy knowing that ProtagonistA had lived ProtagonistA's life to the fullest . 
The first time ProtagonistB met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was eleven years old . ProtagonistA was a new student at ProtagonistB's school , and ProtagonistB was assigned to show ProtagonistA around . From the start , ProtagonistB could tell that ProtagonistA was different . ProtagonistA was quiet and shy , and ProtagonistA did n't seem to fit in with the other kids . But ProtagonistB liked ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB was determined to help ProtagonistA make friends . Over the next few weeks , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA under ProtagonistB's wing . ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA around the school , introduced ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's friends , and helped ProtagonistA feel more comfortable . ProtagonistA slowly started to open up , and before long , ProtagonistA was just another member of ProtagonistB's group of friends . ProtagonistB was happy that ProtagonistB could help ProtagonistA feel welcome and accepted . It was the first time ProtagonistB realized that ProtagonistB had a talent for making friends and helping others feel comfortable in new situations . It was a skill that would serve ProtagonistB well throughout ProtagonistB's life . 
ProtagonistA never knew the difference between December and any other month . To ProtagonistA , they were all the same . ProtagonistA would go to the parish church of St. Martin every day , sit in the back pew , and pray . ProtagonistA would light a candle for ProtagonistA's deceased wife , and then ProtagonistA would leave . One day , as ProtagonistA was leaving the church , ProtagonistA ran into the priest . The priest asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA came to the church every day . ProtagonistA told the priest that ProtagonistA came to pray for ProtagonistA's wife . The priest asked ProtagonistA what month it was . ProtagonistA did n't know . The priest told ProtagonistA that it was December , and that December was a special month . The priest told ProtagonistA that in December , people remember the birth of Jesus Christ . ProtagonistA was amazed . ProtagonistA had never known that before . From then on , ProtagonistA made sure to pray extra hard in December , and ProtagonistA always remembered the birth of Jesus Christ . 
ProtagonistB stood before ProtagonistA , and the breath was stilled before ProtagonistA . They had been friends since kindergarden , but now they were on opposite sides . ProtagonistB was a good man , a family man , and ProtagonistB had always been there for ProtagonistA . But now , ProtagonistA had to take ProtagonistB down . ProtagonistA was the only one who could . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and steadied ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had to do this . It was the only way . ProtagonistA raised ProtagonistA's gun and aimed . ProtagonistB's eyes widened in shock , but ProtagonistB did n't say anything . ProtagonistB just stood there . And then ProtagonistA pulled the trigger . 
After a long - desired death , ProtagonistA , the elder courtship of the wizarding world was ended by the death of ProtagonistA's son . It was a peaceful death , in his sleep , and ProtagonistA was grateful for that . ProtagonistA had seen too much death in ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA did n't want ProtagonistA's son to suffer . As ProtagonistA lay in ProtagonistA's bed , surrounded by ProtagonistA's family , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had done everything ProtagonistA could to make the world a better place . And now , ProtagonistA could rest . 
At every turn ProtagonistA's face grew larger , ProtagonistA's shoulders more than a foot above the floor . ProtagonistA was a giant of a man , and ProtagonistA seemed to be getting taller with every step . ProtagonistA's friends were all afraid of ProtagonistA , and they had good reason to be . ProtagonistA was a gentle giant , but ProtagonistA was also a very strong one . ProtagonistA could easily crush a man 's skull with ProtagonistA's bare hands . One day , ProtagonistA's friends were playing a game of tag . ProtagonistA was it , and ProtagonistA was chasing them around . They were all laughing and having a good time , but then something happened . ProtagonistA's foot got caught on a tree root , and ProtagonistA fell . ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistA's head on a rock , and ProtagonistA was knocked unconscious . ProtagonistA's friends were terrified . They did n't know what to do . They knew that ProtagonistA was strong , but they also knew that ProtagonistA was kind . They did n't want to hurt ProtagonistA , but they did n't want to leave ProtagonistA lying there unconscious . Finally , they decided to carry ProtagonistA to the nearest hospital . They were worried that ProtagonistA might die , but they also knew that ProtagonistA was in good hands . ProtagonistA woke up a few days later , and ProtagonistA was back to ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's friends were relieved , and they were happy to see that ProtagonistA was okay . ProtagonistA is a gentle giant , but ProtagonistA 's also a strong one . ProtagonistA 's always been there for ProtagonistA's friends , and they know that they can always count on ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had seen death before . ProtagonistA had seen it in the eyes of ProtagonistA's patients , in their final moments . ProtagonistA knew the look of a person who was about to die . But ProtagonistA had never seen it in the eyes of someone so young . Fourteen years ago , when ProtagonistA was conducting ProtagonistA's last examination of ProtagonistA's patients , ProtagonistA had an idea of what might befall ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be consumed by fear , that ProtagonistB would be tortured by the thought of ProtagonistB's own mortality . And so it was that ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA sitting in ProtagonistB's room , watching as ProtagonistB writhed in pain , ProtagonistB's eyes wide with terror . ProtagonistA knew that there was nothing ProtagonistA could do to ease ProtagonistB's suffering , but ProtagonistA stayed with ProtagonistB anyway , until the end . ProtagonistB's death was a tragedy , but it was also a wake - up call for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA needed to find a way to help people come to terms with their own mortality . And so ProtagonistA started a support group for people who were afraid of death . The group has been a success , and ProtagonistA has helped many people come to terms with their own mortality . ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistB's death was not in vain , and that ProtagonistB's legacy will live on through the people ProtagonistA has helped . 
ProtagonistA was a kindly old man who loved to help others . So when ProtagonistA saw the state of the flat , ProtagonistA was appalled . The poor tenants were living in squalor , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to help . ProtagonistA knocked on the door and was let in by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA around the flat , and ProtagonistA was shocked by what ProtagonistA saw . The place was a mess , and the tenants were clearly struggling . ProtagonistA offered to help them clean up the place and to get them some food and supplies . The tenants were grateful , and soon the flat was looking much better . ProtagonistA continued to help the tenants , and ProtagonistA soon became a good friend to them . ProtagonistA was always there for them when they needed help , and ProtagonistA was proud to have made a difference in their lives . 
There was once ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was a small town in the middle of nowhere . The only thing that was in ProtagonistA was a gas station and a grocery store . ProtagonistB's family was the only family who lived in ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB's mom worked at the gas station and ProtagonistB's dad worked at the grocery store . ProtagonistB went to school online because there was no school in ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was bored out of ProtagonistB's mind living in ProtagonistA . The only thing ProtagonistB had to do was go outside and explore . ProtagonistB would explore ProtagonistA and the surrounding area . ProtagonistB would find new things to do everyday to keep ProtagonistB entertained . One day , ProtagonistB found a cave that nobody knew about . ProtagonistB explored the cave and found a secret room that nobody else knew about . ProtagonistB was excited to have found something new . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistB's parents about the cave and they said ProtagonistB could go explore it as long as ProtagonistB was careful . ProtagonistB was happy to have something to do . ProtagonistB spent everyday exploring the cave and finding new things . ProtagonistB was happy living in ProtagonistA because ProtagonistB had something to do . 
ProtagonistA was a very pretty girl , with dark hair which fell to ProtagonistA's shoulders , a light complexion , strong eyebrows and a shining face . ProtagonistA had been brought up in a small village and had never seen anything like the big city . ProtagonistA was very excited to be there and to see all the sights . The first thing ProtagonistA did was to go to the park . ProtagonistA sat on a bench and watched the people go by . ProtagonistA saw a lot of pretty girls , but none as pretty as ProtagonistA . After a while , ProtagonistA got up and walked around . ProtagonistA looked in shop windows and at the people in the street . ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do next . ProtagonistA walked around for a while longer , and then ProtagonistA saw a sign for a museum . ProtagonistA had never been to a museum before , so ProtagonistA decided to go in . ProtagonistA looked at all the paintings and the sculptures . ProtagonistA was so fascinated by everything that ProtagonistA forgot to look at the time . When ProtagonistA finally came out , it was getting dark . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA was lost . ProtagonistA started to panic , but then ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA went up to ProtagonistB and asked for help . ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA ProtagonistA's name and where ProtagonistA lived .

ProtagonistA had a great day , even though ProtagonistA got lost . 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the bed , and ProtagonistA looked up at the ceiling with a trembling hand . ProtagonistA was trying to make sense of what had happened , but ProtagonistA's mind was foggy and it was hard to think straight . The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was being at the party and then everything went blank . ProtagonistA must have been drugged , but ProtagonistA could n't be sure . ProtagonistA looked around the room and saw that ProtagonistA was in a strange place . ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was or how ProtagonistA got there . ProtagonistA was about to get up and try to find some answers when ProtagonistA heard a noise at the door . Someone was coming . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA was paralyzed with fear . 
ProtagonistA had been married to ProtagonistA's husband for ten years , and they had a child together . But ProtagonistA had always been unhappy , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA needed to leave . ProtagonistA had been thinking about it for a long time , and ProtagonistA had even started packing ProtagonistA's bags . But ProtagonistA never could bring ProtagonistA to actually leave . Until one day , when ProtagonistA came home and found ProtagonistA's husband and child in the kitchen , laughing and happy together . It was too much for ProtagonistA to take , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to go . So ProtagonistA said goodbye to ProtagonistA's husband and child , and ProtagonistA walked out the door . It was the hardest thing ProtagonistA had ever done , but ProtagonistA knew it was for the best . ProtagonistA was finally free to be ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was never going to look back . 
The first time I saw ProtagonistA ProtagonistA was in a corridor of the saloon of the house on Heffernan Street , in the midst of Barnes ' Market . It was a warm day and the market was bustling with people . ProtagonistA was leaning against the wall , smoking a cigarette . ProtagonistA had a rough look about ProtagonistA , but there was something in ProtagonistA's eyes that caught my attention . I walked over to ProtagonistA and we began talking . We talked for hours , and I soon found out that ProtagonistA was one of the most interesting people I had ever met . ProtagonistA had a wild past , and ProtagonistA was currently living in the saloon because ProtagonistA had nowhere else to go . I invited ProtagonistA to stay with me , and ProtagonistA accepted . From that day on , ProtagonistA became a part of my life . ProtagonistA was my friend , my confidante , and my protector . I will never forget the first time I saw ProtagonistA . 
The boy in the striped tunic , who had looked almost exactly like a man , when ProtagonistA was five inches long , and five inches tall , and had fair hair , looked exactly like Bob , and in fact looked a great deal like a woman , at the time of ProtagonistA's first conception . ProtagonistB had been very beautiful , and very young , and ProtagonistB had died when ProtagonistA was only a few days old .

ProtagonistA had always been interested in photography , and ProtagonistA had a natural talent for it . But ProtagonistA never pursued it as a career , because ProtagonistA did n't think ProtagonistA could make a living doing something ProtagonistA loved .

ProtagonistA was going to have to kill ProtagonistB . It was nothing personal , ProtagonistA just could n't have ProtagonistB around anymore . ProtagonistB had become a liability and ProtagonistA could n't take that risk . ProtagonistA sat down on the arm of the chair , looking into ProtagonistB's eyes .

ProtagonistB fought against ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB was no match for ProtagonistA's strength . ProtagonistB could feel ProtagonistB's life slipping away , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB was going to die . Suddenly , ProtagonistA stopped strangling ProtagonistB and looked at ProtagonistB with a confused expression on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA let ProtagonistB go and ProtagonistB fell to the floor , gasping for breath . ProtagonistA just stood there , looking at ProtagonistB , and then ProtagonistA turned and walked out of the room . ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistA go downstairs and out the front door . ProtagonistB lay there for a moment , trying to catch ProtagonistB's breath , and then ProtagonistB got up and ran to the window . ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA walking down the street , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was going to kill again . 
ProtagonistB had not expected to find ProtagonistA dead . ProtagonistB had been out for a walk in the woods when ProtagonistB came across ProtagonistA's body . ProtagonistA was lying on the ground , ProtagonistA's eyes open and staring up at the sky . There was a large pool of blood around ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistB did not know what to do . ProtagonistB stood there for a moment , unsure of what to do . Then ProtagonistB turned and ran back the way ProtagonistB had come . ProtagonistB did not want to be the one who found the body of ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was a happy man . ProtagonistA loved life and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's spear . Every Sunday , ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistA's spear and go out into the field to hunt . This particular Sunday was special to ProtagonistA . It was the first Sunday in June , and the first thing the sun saw when it rose was that glinting spear of ProtagonistA in the distance . ProtagonistA was called Der Runde because ProtagonistA was always so cheerful and round . ProtagonistA had a big belly that shook when ProtagonistA laughed , and a face that was always smiling . Even on this cold morning , when the sun was just starting to peek over the horizon , ProtagonistA was smiling . ProtagonistA knew that today was going to be a good day . ProtagonistA walked through the field , looking for any signs of game . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes . ProtagonistA tensed , preparing to throw ProtagonistA's spear . But then , out from the bushes , a rabbit hopped into the open . ProtagonistA relaxed and laughed . ProtagonistA had been so sure that it was going to be a deer or some other big game . But a rabbit was nothing to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA could catch one of those with ProtagonistA's bare hands . ProtagonistA walked over to the rabbit and picked it up . It was still warm from sleeping in the bushes . ProtagonistA stroked its fur for a moment before snapping its neck . Then ProtagonistA put the rabbit in ProtagonistA's bag and continued on ProtagonistA's way . ProtagonistA had enough food for the week now , and ProtagonistA was happy . 
ProtagonistA was a young angel who had just recently been assigned to watch over the small town of Abirondack . ProtagonistA was excited to have ProtagonistA's first solo assignment and could n't wait to explore the town and meet all of the residents . ProtagonistA flew around the town for a few days , getting to know the layout and the people . ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA's favorite spot to perch on the top of one of the peaks of the Abirondack mountains . From ProtagonistA's vantage point , ProtagonistA could see the entire town and all of the people going about their daily lives . One day , as ProtagonistA was sitting on ProtagonistA's peak , ProtagonistA noticed something strange happening . Some of the people in town were starting to sprout wings ! ProtagonistA was shocked and confused . ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it before . ProtagonistA watched as more and more people in town grew wings . Some people had one pair , while others had two or even three pairs ! ProtagonistA did n't know what to make of it . As ProtagonistA continued to watch , ProtagonistA saw people flying around town , soaring through the air with ease . It was amazing to see . Then , ProtagonistA noticed that ProtagonistA's own wings were starting to disappear ! ProtagonistA panicked and flew down to the ground to see what was happening . ProtagonistA soon realized that as the people in town were growing wings , ProtagonistA was losing ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't know why , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to accept it . ProtagonistA flew back to ProtagonistA's peak and watched as the people of Abirondack took to the skies , leaving ProtagonistA behind . ProtagonistA felt a little sad and lonely , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to be content with watching over the town from the ground . 
ProtagonistA was a beautiful and purring one , with a bright , clear face and a wary look in ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA was always on the lookout for danger , and ProtagonistA was never afraid to take on anything that came ProtagonistA's way . ProtagonistA was the kind of cat that everyone wanted to be around , and ProtagonistA always made sure that everyone felt welcome in ProtagonistA's presence . 
Bob was a very old and very wretched woman , and one of the most detestable characters in the country ; but in my opinion , among all women , ProtagonistA was the most infamous . ProtagonistA had been a prostitute for many years , and had committed every conceivable crime . ProtagonistA was a thief , a liar , and a cheat ; and ProtagonistA was also a murderer . But ProtagonistA was not content with these crimes ; ProtagonistA also used ProtagonistA's powers of witchcraft to harm people . ProtagonistA was a wicked old woman , and everyone in the village hated ProtagonistA . 
The ghost of ProtagonistA towered over the room . His eyes were glowing red and his mouth was open in a silent scream . The other ghosts in the room were cowering in fear . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a bully . Even in death , ProtagonistA liked to terrorize the other ghosts . But this time , ProtagonistA had gone too far . The other ghosts had had enough of ProtagonistA's bullying and they were going to do something about it . They surrounded ProtagonistA and began to haunt ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was soon reduced to a quivering mass of terror . ProtagonistA begged the other ghosts to stop , but they would n't . They were going to make ProtagonistA pay for all the pain and suffering ProtagonistA had caused them . 
ProtagonistA had been debating all day whether ProtagonistA wanted to go to the country inn or ProtagonistB's house . ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA went to the inn , ProtagonistA would most likely die in the cold and damp . However , ProtagonistA was not sure if it was worth it to go to ProtagonistB's house and die in the heat . In the end , ProtagonistA decided to go to ProtagonistB's house . When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistB had already passed away . ProtagonistA died shortly after from the heat . 
ProtagonistA had once left a large sum of money and ProtagonistA's house in London for the purpose of making a new life for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had wanted a man who would be faithful to ProtagonistA in the world . ProtagonistA had met many men who had promised to be faithful , but they had all eventually betrayed ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had almost given up hope of finding someone who would truly love ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was everything ProtagonistA had ever wanted in a man and more . ProtagonistB was kind , gentle , and loving , and ProtagonistB promised to always be faithful to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA believed ProtagonistB and they began a life together . For several years , everything was perfect between them . ProtagonistA was happier than ProtagonistA had ever been and ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistB was the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA . However , one day ProtagonistA came home and found ProtagonistB in bed with another man . ProtagonistA was heartbroken and devastated . ProtagonistA could n't believe that ProtagonistB had betrayed ProtagonistA after everything they had been through together . ProtagonistA left ProtagonistB and never looked back . ProtagonistA vowed to never trust another man again . 
ProtagonistA was a mother 's lady and ProtagonistB was the nicest girl in the world . ProtagonistB always had a smile on ProtagonistB's face and was always willing to help others . ProtagonistA was very proud of ProtagonistB and loved ProtagonistB very much . One day , when ProtagonistB was out playing with ProtagonistB's friends , ProtagonistB was hit by a car and killed . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to go on without ProtagonistB . But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be strong for ProtagonistA's wife and other daughter . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would want ProtagonistA to be happy and to keep living . So that 's what ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA lived for ProtagonistB and tried to make the best of every day . 
The night ProtagonistA vanished was the night when ProtagonistA shared ProtagonistA's bed with ProtagonistB . It was also the night when ProtagonistB vanished . ProtagonistA had always been a bit odd , and ProtagonistB was the only one who ever really understood ProtagonistA . That 's why ProtagonistB did n't hesitate when ProtagonistA asked if ProtagonistB could share ProtagonistB's bed . But when ProtagonistB woke up the next morning , ProtagonistA was gone . There was no trace of ProtagonistA anywhere . ProtagonistB searched for ProtagonistA for weeks , but ProtagonistA was never seen again . Some people say that ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB both vanished into thin air . Others say that they were abducted by aliens . But no one knows for sure what happened to them . 
ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was learning all about the Universe and how it worked . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could understand everything and ProtagonistA was excited to share ProtagonistA's new knowledge with everyone ProtagonistA knew . But then , suddenly , ProtagonistA felt something was wrong . ProtagonistA could n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but ProtagonistA knew something was wrong with ProtagonistA's soul . ProtagonistA was n't sure what to do or where to turn , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to find answers . ProtagonistA started to search for answers and eventually ProtagonistA found some comfort in religion . ProtagonistA started to believe that there was something bigger than ProtagonistA and that helped ProtagonistA to feel better . ProtagonistA slowly started to rebuild ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA is now happier than ever . 
The last time they saw each other , ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's seventh year . ProtagonistA was getting ready to retire , and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's wife had decided to move to Florida . They had sold their house and most of their belongings , and were planning to live off of ProtagonistA's pension . ProtagonistA's wife had died a few years before , and ProtagonistA was looking forward to finally being able to relax and enjoy ProtagonistA's retirement . ProtagonistA had stayed in touch with some of ProtagonistA's old friends from work , but ProtagonistA had n't seen them in years . When ProtagonistA got the call that ProtagonistB had died , ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB in years , but ProtagonistA had always thought of ProtagonistB fondly . ProtagonistA decided to go to ProtagonistB's funeral , and ProtagonistA was surprised to see how many people had turned out . ProtagonistA was even more surprised when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was all grown up now , and ProtagonistC was beautiful . They hugged each other and cried , and ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had come to the funeral . It was the last time they saw each other . 
On Tuesday , Mr. Bligh came to me at home with the news that ProtagonistA had been admitted into the College of the Holy - McPherson Priory , and that it would be five years before ProtagonistA would be able to see ProtagonistB . I was so excited for ProtagonistA and could n't wait to tell ProtagonistB the good news . I knew ProtagonistB would be just as excited as I was . 
It was a cold , windless day , and it was almost the middle of the year , and ProtagonistA lay in bed , like everything else was wrong , and ProtagonistA had a headache , and three inches of ProtagonistA's nose was already gone . The doctors said that it was just a cold , but ProtagonistA knew that something was wrong . ProtagonistA had been feeling off for weeks , and now ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA was dying . ProtagonistA had never been a religious man , but ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA praying for a miracle . ProtagonistA did n't want to die . ProtagonistA heard a noise at the window and turned to see a bird flying into the room . It landed on ProtagonistA's bed and looked at ProtagonistA with its bright eyes . ProtagonistA felt a sudden warmth in ProtagonistA's chest and knew that the bird was ProtagonistA's miracle . ProtagonistA sat up and the bird flew onto ProtagonistA's shoulder . It chirped softly in ProtagonistA's ear and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's headache disappearing . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to be alright . 
ProtagonistA was in the kitchen about that time , knitting a scarf for Harry , when ProtagonistA noticed a shadow sitting on the table . It was a small shadow , about the size of a cat . ProtagonistA did n't think much of it and went back to ProtagonistA's knitting . A few minutes later , ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the living room . ProtagonistA got up to investigate and saw the shadow sitting on the couch , watching TV . ProtagonistA was a little surprised , but ProtagonistA did n't say anything . ProtagonistA went back to the kitchen and finished knitting the scarf . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bright boy . So when ProtagonistA was admitted into the College of the Holy McPherson Priory , ProtagonistB was not surprised . But ProtagonistB was disappointed that ProtagonistB would not be able to see ProtagonistA for five years . Mr . Bligh had come to ProtagonistB with the news , and ProtagonistB was grateful to him for keeping ProtagonistB informed . But ProtagonistB could not help feeling a little sad . ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's only nephew , and ProtagonistB had always been close to ProtagonistA . Now ProtagonistB would have to wait five years to see ProtagonistA again . But ProtagonistB was happy for ProtagonistA , and knew that ProtagonistA would do great things at the college . 
Alive , eight days after the death of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA sat down to choose a subject of conversation with ProtagonistA's neighbour - the world 's most eminent apothecary , Doctor Joseph Vane - the world 's greatest chocolate connoisseur of the nineteenth century , Mr. Belvedere of the Parisian street fly- and - supplies , Dr. John Quartermaster - of the ship - whale Squadron Heterozone of the Navy - and indeed the world - famous spectacles - in - the - air , as ProtagonistA was giving the order of concealment to ProtagonistA's revolver and was about to read out the returning message of a dramatic undertone , which the man in question had written for her:-I am coming to murder you ! Go away , madman ! ' as the prompt . The doorbell rang . Bob , who had been expecting the arrival of the postman , got up to answer it . When ProtagonistA opened the door , ProtagonistA was shocked to see ProtagonistB's murderer standing there . Without a word , the man raised his revolver and shot ProtagonistA in the head . As ProtagonistA lay dying on the floor , ProtagonistA's last thoughts were of ProtagonistB and how much ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA was always a beautiful person , inside and out . So , when I had the good fortune to see ProtagonistA grow old , I was n't surprised that ProtagonistA was still as gorgeous as ever . ProtagonistA was like a goddess , with ProtagonistA's silver hair and wrinkle - free skin . ProtagonistA was always so full of life and energy , even in ProtagonistA's old age . It was a joy to see ProtagonistA age gracefully and still be the same wonderful person I 'd always known . 
ProtagonistA had been walking home from work , minding ProtagonistA's own business , when ProtagonistA ran into ProtagonistB . It was literally the worst day of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistB was a big , burly man , and ProtagonistB was in a bad mood . ProtagonistB started shouting at ProtagonistA , and before ProtagonistA knew it , ProtagonistA was in a full - blown fight with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB punched ProtagonistA in the face , and ProtagonistA went down hard . ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA was going to die . But then , something miraculous happened . ProtagonistB stopped punching ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's feet . ProtagonistB apologized for losing ProtagonistB's temper , and ProtagonistB even offered to buy ProtagonistA a drink . ProtagonistA was stunned . ProtagonistA had never expected ProtagonistB to be anything other than a violent thug . But from that day forward , the two men became friends . They would often meet up for a drink after work , and they would talk about their lives . ProtagonistA was happy to have found a friend in ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was grateful that their first meeting had n't ended in tragedy . 
It was a cold , wind - shrouded morning when ProtagonistA tucked me into bed , one full of the dread of the future , and ProtagonistA's own worries , and put ProtagonistA's trust and faith in me . I was only six years old , and I did n't know what the future held , but I could see the worry in ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA kissed me on the forehead and told me to be brave , no matter what happened . I nodded , not really understanding , but trusting ProtagonistA implicitly . I would be brave . The next few years were hard ones , as the world around us changed and grew more dangerous . But through it all , ProtagonistA was there , always keeping me safe . I did n't always understand why things were happening , but I knew that ProtagonistA would never let anything happen to me . And then , one day , ProtagonistA was gone . I was only ten years old when ProtagonistA died , but I was brave . I knew ProtagonistA would want me to be , so I put on a brave face for my mother and sister . It was hard , sometimes , but I knew that ProtagonistA would be proud of me . Now , years later , I still think of ProtagonistA every cold , wind - shrouded morning . And I am still brave . 
ProtagonistA was going to stop calling ProtagonistB  ProtagonistD ,  said ProtagonistC , though ProtagonistA did not know at the time what ProtagonistA called ProtagonistA , or what ProtagonistA regarded as ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB had always been a bit of an oddball , and ProtagonistC had always been a bit of a traditionalist . ProtagonistC did n't approve of ProtagonistB's eccentricities and ProtagonistC certainly did n't approve of ProtagonistB calling ProtagonistA  Madam .  But ProtagonistA liked ProtagonistB , despite ProtagonistB's quirks , and ProtagonistA did n't see any reason to stop calling ProtagonistB by ProtagonistD . One day , ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA continued to call ProtagonistB  Madam .  ProtagonistA thought for a moment and then explained that ProtagonistB was just different from everyone else and that ProtagonistA liked ProtagonistB for that . ProtagonistC was taken aback by ProtagonistA's response and ProtagonistC realized that ProtagonistC had been wrong about ProtagonistB all along . From then on , ProtagonistC started to see ProtagonistB in a different light and ProtagonistC even began to call ProtagonistB  Madam  ProtagonistC . 
ProtagonistA flung open the white door of ProtagonistA's kitchen and directed ProtagonistB to the dining room . ProtagonistB , hesitated for a moment before following ProtagonistA's lead . ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB to a seat at the table and then went back to the kitchen to finish preparing dinner . ProtagonistB sat at the table , not quite sure what to do . ProtagonistB looked around the room , taking in the pictures on the walls and the knick - knacks on the shelves . After a few minutes , ProtagonistA came back into the room carrying a tray of food . ProtagonistA set it down in front of ProtagonistB and then took a seat across from ProtagonistB . The two men ate in silence . ProtagonistA was content to let ProtagonistB eat ProtagonistB's fill before ProtagonistA started asking questions . ProtagonistB , however , was not used to being silent and soon started to chatter away . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life , ProtagonistB's job , ProtagonistB's family . ProtagonistA listened patiently , only interjecting to ask the occasional question . When ProtagonistB was done eating , ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's company and showed ProtagonistB to the door . ProtagonistB was clearly reluctant to leave , but ProtagonistA was adamant . ProtagonistA said goodbye and watched as ProtagonistB walked down the path to the street . ProtagonistA went back inside and returned to the kitchen . ProtagonistA was content to have made a new friend , even if it was a bit unusual . 
Not long after ProtagonistA was born , ProtagonistA had a dream . In the dream , ProtagonistA was standing in front of a large , imposing door . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA got there , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to go through the door . ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA took a deep breath and walked through . On the other side , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden . The sun was shining and the flowers were blooming . ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and happiness . ProtagonistA knew that this was ProtagonistA's true home . 
ProtagonistA wanted a new car . ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's eye on a shiny red convertible , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to get it . ProtagonistA did n't have the money to buy it outright , and ProtagonistA did n't think ProtagonistA could get a loan for it . ProtagonistA thought about stealing it , but that was too risky . ProtagonistA considered asking ProtagonistA's parents for the money , but ProtagonistA did n't want to have to explain why ProtagonistA wanted a new car . ProtagonistA was stuck . One day , ProtagonistA saw the car parked in a lot with the keys in the ignition . ProtagonistA looked around to see if anyone was watching , and then ProtagonistA got in and drove off . ProtagonistA felt guilty , but ProtagonistA also felt excited . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to return the car before anyone noticed it was gone , but ProtagonistA could n't resist taking it for a joyride first . ProtagonistA drove around the city with the top down , feeling the wind in ProtagonistA's hair . It was the best feeling in the world . Eventually , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had to take the car back . ProtagonistA parked it in the lot and left the keys in the ignition . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was in for a lot of trouble , but ProtagonistA did n't care . It was worth it . 
ProtagonistA was a stranger , and a stranger that ProtagonistA was , if ProtagonistA had been anything like any other woman of flesh or blood . ProtagonistA came to ProtagonistB's door one day , seeking shelter from the rain . ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA in , and they talked long into the night . ProtagonistB learned that ProtagonistA was a wanderer , and that ProtagonistA had no home to go to . ProtagonistB offered ProtagonistA a place to stay , and ProtagonistA accepted . They became friends , and eventually lovers . But one day , ProtagonistA disappeared , and ProtagonistB never saw ProtagonistA again . ProtagonistB always wondered what happened to ProtagonistA , and if ProtagonistA ever thought of ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had only been married for three months when ProtagonistA died unexpectedly at ProtagonistA's home in Newton . The cause of death was complications from pregnancy . ProtagonistB was devastated . ProtagonistB was pregnant with their first child and had been looking forward to starting a family with ProtagonistA . Now ProtagonistB was left alone , with no husband and no child . ProtagonistB was heartbroken . ProtagonistA's death was a shock to everyone . ProtagonistA was only in ProtagonistA's early 30s and was in good health . ProtagonistA's death was a tragedy and ProtagonistB was never able to get over it . 
I was born in a house where ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's name from the gods , and the father from the earth . I never knew my father , but ProtagonistA was always there for me . ProtagonistA taught me how to hunt and fish , and how to survive in the wilderness . ProtagonistA was a great man , and I loved ProtagonistA like a father . 
Nearly two hours after ProtagonistA had set out on ProtagonistA's journey to the far - away city of S- , ProtagonistA arrived at the eastern gate of the town . ProtagonistA had been walking for most of the journey , as ProtagonistA's horse had been stolen shortly after ProtagonistA had set out . ProtagonistA was tired , hungry , and thirsty , but ProtagonistA was determined to find a way to the city . ProtagonistA asked the guard at the gate if there was any way ProtagonistA could get to the city , and the guard told ProtagonistA that there was a wagon that would be leaving soon . ProtagonistA was relieved and thanked the guard before ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way to the wagon . ProtagonistA climbed aboard and settled in for the ride . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a rebel . ProtagonistA was never one to follow the crowd and ProtagonistA always marched to the beat of ProtagonistA's own drum . So , when ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's home in Maine to go to college in Boston , it was no surprise to anyone who knew ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by trains . ProtagonistA loved the way they looked , the way they sounded , and the way they made ProtagonistA feel . ProtagonistA was excited to be taking a train for the first time by ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had never been to Boston before and ProtagonistA was looking forward to exploring the city . The train ride was everything that ProtagonistA had hoped for and more . ProtagonistA loved the feeling of the wind blowing through ProtagonistA's hair as the train sped down the tracks . ProtagonistA was in awe of the city as it whizzed by outside ProtagonistA's window . ProtagonistA could n't wait to get off the train and explore . ProtagonistA had a great time during ProtagonistA's first year in college . ProtagonistA made new friends , learned a lot , and had some great experiences . ProtagonistA would always remember the time ProtagonistA took the train by ProtagonistA to Boston . It was a journey that ProtagonistA would never forget . 
ProtagonistA was sixteen and in love , and ProtagonistA was going to have to kill someone . ProtagonistA had never wanted to hurt anyone , but ProtagonistA's love for ProtagonistB was so strong that ProtagonistA would do anything for ProtagonistB . Even if it meant taking a life . ProtagonistB was the daughter of a rival gang leader , and if ProtagonistA did n't kill ProtagonistB's father , ProtagonistB would be forced to marry someone else . ProtagonistA could n't let that happen . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB too much . So ProtagonistA steeled ProtagonistA for the task ahead , and on the night of the big gang showdown , ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB's father . It was the only way to save ProtagonistB . And ProtagonistA would do it again in a heartbeat , if it meant that ProtagonistB could be ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was a good and kind woman , and as such ProtagonistA would not have anything to do with a sick man . ProtagonistA was content to live ProtagonistA's life alone , without the hassle of caring for someone else . However , one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA could not turn away from ProtagonistB , and so ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB in and cared for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was very grateful , and ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA liked the feeling of helping someone in need . From then on , ProtagonistA made it ProtagonistA's mission to help as many sick people as ProtagonistA could . 
ProtagonistA had been sitting in the cart behind the house for hours , but ProtagonistA had kept ProtagonistA's eyes on the horses , which were galloping along at a good clip . ProtagonistA had been waiting for an opportunity to escape and now ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's chance . ProtagonistA quickly jumped out of the cart and ran towards the horses . ProtagonistA was able to grab one of their tails and was pulled along behind them . ProtagonistA was terrified , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to hold on . After a few minutes , the horses slowed down and ProtagonistA was able to let go . ProtagonistA lay on the ground , panting and shaking . ProtagonistA was lucky to be alive . 
ProtagonistB had always been a bit odd , but ProtagonistA never really paid much attention to it . That is , until ProtagonistB started keeping rooks in their house . At first , ProtagonistA thought it was just a phase ProtagonistB was going through , but then ProtagonistB started getting more and more birds and started to neglect ProtagonistB's other hobbies . ProtagonistA tried to talk to ProtagonistB about it , but ProtagonistB just brushed ProtagonistA off , saying that it is what it is and that 's what ProtagonistB wants to do . Now , the house is full of birds and ProtagonistA ca n't stand it . ProtagonistA 's tried everything to get ProtagonistB to see reason , but ProtagonistB just wo n't listen . The birds are everywhere , in every room , and they 're starting to drive ProtagonistA crazy . ProtagonistA ca n't concentrate on anything with their constant squawking and ProtagonistA 's starting to feel like ProtagonistA 's going insane . One day , ProtagonistA snaps . ProtagonistA ca n't take it anymore and ProtagonistA starts yelling at ProtagonistB , telling ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB needs to get rid of the birds . ProtagonistB tries to calm ProtagonistA down , but it 's too late , ProtagonistA 's already worked ProtagonistA up into a frenzy . ProtagonistA starts throwing things , smashing the bird cages and freeing the birds . ProtagonistB tries to stop ProtagonistA , but it 's too late , the damage is done . ProtagonistA does n't know what to do now . ProtagonistA 's ruined everything and ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistB will never forgive ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 's destroyed ProtagonistB's hobby and ProtagonistB's life 's work and ProtagonistA ca n't take it back . ProtagonistA can only hope that someday ProtagonistB 'll be able to forgive ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA knows it will be a long time before that happens . 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA 'd killed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA 'd been planning it for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA 'd found out about ProtagonistB's dark secret . ProtagonistA had always been a good person , but ProtagonistA could n't let ProtagonistB's evil continue . So ProtagonistA snuck into ProtagonistB's chambers one night and stabbed ProtagonistB in the heart . ProtagonistB gasped and fell to the ground , dead . ProtagonistA felt a surge of triumph as ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA 'd done the world a great service . But then ProtagonistB's body began to glow and ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA 'd made a mistake . ProtagonistB was not dead , but merely in a deep sleep . ProtagonistA had only killed ProtagonistB's physical body - the magic inside ProtagonistB was still alive and well . ProtagonistB's spirit appeared before ProtagonistA , looking angry and disappointed . ProtagonistA begged for forgiveness , but it was too late . The damage was done . ProtagonistB cast a spell on ProtagonistA , turning ProtagonistA into a toad . And then ProtagonistB disappeared , leaving ProtagonistA alone to suffer the consequences of ProtagonistA's actions . 
ProtagonistA stood up from ProtagonistA's chair and leaned forward , ProtagonistA's head leaning forward and ProtagonistA's hands clasped across ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA was trying to figure out what to do next . ProtagonistA had been sitting in ProtagonistA's chair for hours , just thinking . But now , ProtagonistA was ready to take action . ProtagonistA was going to stand up and figure out what was going on in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately . First , ProtagonistA's wife had left ProtagonistA . Then , ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's job . And now , ProtagonistA was facing eviction from ProtagonistA's apartment . ProtagonistA had nowhere to go and no one to turn to . But ProtagonistA was not going to give up . ProtagonistA was going to stand up and fight for ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was going to find a way to make things right again . ProtagonistA started by going to the library . ProtagonistA checked out books on finding a job and on starting a new life . ProtagonistA read them all , and then ProtagonistA started to put their advice into action . ProtagonistA started by looking for a new job . ProtagonistA applied to dozens of places , and finally , ProtagonistA got a job at a local grocery store . It was n't ProtagonistA's dream job , but it was a start . Then , ProtagonistA started to look for a new place to live . ProtagonistA found an apartment that ProtagonistA could afford , and ProtagonistA moved in . Finally , ProtagonistA started to reach out to ProtagonistA's friends and family .

ProtagonistA was slowly getting ProtagonistA's life back on track . And ProtagonistA was determined to never give up again . 
ProtagonistA was in the midst of the courtyard around ProtagonistA's apartment when ProtagonistA saw a rat dart by . ProtagonistA was so startled that ProtagonistA jumped up and ran back inside . ProtagonistA quickly told ProtagonistB what ProtagonistA had seen and ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would call the landlord . ProtagonistA was relieved that someone would take care of the problem . 
ProtagonistA had always loved the sun . As a child , ProtagonistA would spend hours playing in the park , basking in the warm rays . But now , as ProtagonistA sat in ProtagonistA's garden , ProtagonistA could only think of the sun as a cruel joke . It was a reminder of all that ProtagonistA had lost . The sun had risen on a grey , smogless September day when the bombs fell . ProtagonistA remembered it so vividly . ProtagonistA had been at work , sitting in ProtagonistA's office , when ProtagonistA heard the first explosion . At first , ProtagonistA thought it was a thunderstorm . But then ProtagonistA saw the plume of smoke rising in the distance . ProtagonistA ran outside , and the sky was filled with planes . They were dropping bombs , and the city was being destroyed . ProtagonistA could only watch in horror as the world ProtagonistA knew was being destroyed . Eventually , the bombs stopped falling , and the sun rose on a grey , smogless September day . ProtagonistA sat down in ProtagonistA's front - yard garden in Monument Hill , a grimy island of green , and stared into the little pool , imagining a world without a sky of silver or the blue of crimson . 
ProtagonistA was overjoyed when ProtagonistA's wife gave birth to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a beautiful baby girl . They named ProtagonistB's ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA decided to take the day off from work to spend time with ProtagonistA's new family . It was a great , wonderful day . 
The last night ProtagonistA had been on earth , ProtagonistA could n't believe it . ProtagonistB had a dream where ProtagonistB was just a girl and ProtagonistB was walking along in the garden , and suddenly a great wickedness smote ProtagonistB , and - now this is scary ! - and ProtagonistB was flying . In ProtagonistB's dream , ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA's body lying on the ground , and a great black bird was flying away . When ProtagonistB woke up , ProtagonistB was sweating and shaking . ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA had been killed , and ProtagonistB was the only one who could have done it . 
ProtagonistA was born into a wealthy family in the city of Paris on the morning of February 19 , 1612 . ProtagonistA's parents named ProtagonistA after ProtagonistA's grandfather , who was also a wealthy man . ProtagonistA grew up in a life of luxury , never wanting for anything . ProtagonistA attended the best schools and had the best of everything . As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to realize that ProtagonistA was different from other people . ProtagonistA did n't feel the same things that they did . ProtagonistA did n't care about the same things . ProtagonistA began to feel like ProtagonistA was living in a world that was n't meant for ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA ran away from home . ProtagonistA left everything behind and started a new life . ProtagonistA changed ProtagonistA's name and started over . ProtagonistA found a new group of friends who accepted ProtagonistA for who ProtagonistA was . And ProtagonistA finally felt like ProtagonistA belonged . 
ProtagonistA had been walking along the banks of the river Thames in the company of several other persons in the neighbourhood of a certain house called the Mulhouse . ProtagonistA was in the possession of Mrs. Christopher M. Murrell who , on Bob 's death - bed , had permitted ProtagonistA to live in the room where ProtagonistA had been born at the time of his death . ProtagonistA had been walking with ProtagonistA and the others for some time when ProtagonistA suddenly stopped and said that ProtagonistA wanted to go back to the Mulhouse . ProtagonistA and the others tried to persuade ProtagonistA to continue walking with them but ProtagonistA was adamant about wanting to go back . ProtagonistA eventually relented and said that ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistA back to the Mulhouse . When they arrived at the Mulhouse , ProtagonistA went into the room where ProtagonistA had been born and sat down on the bed . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA wanted to stay there for a while and that ProtagonistA should go back to the river Thames and continue walking with the others . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA would stay with ProtagonistA but ProtagonistA insisted that ProtagonistA go . After a few minutes , ProtagonistA left the Mulhouse and continued walking with the others . Some time later , ProtagonistA came out of the Mulhouse and joined ProtagonistA and the others . They continued walking along the banks of the river Thames and eventually arrived at their destination . ProtagonistA bid farewell to ProtagonistA and the others and went on ProtagonistA's way . 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the bed , looking at ProtagonistA in the mirror . ProtagonistA was thinking about how ProtagonistA's life had turned out . ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a successful businessman , but things had never quite worked out for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a dreamer , and ProtagonistA knew that had held ProtagonistA back . ProtagonistA had never been able to really commit to anything , and as a result , ProtagonistA had always ended up falling short . But now , ProtagonistA was starting to feel like maybe it was time to make a change . ProtagonistA was getting older , and ProtagonistA wanted to make something of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA wanted to finally achieve something . ProtagonistA was tired of living a life of mediocrity , and ProtagonistA was ready to start reaching for the stars . ProtagonistA got up from the bed and walked over to the mirror . ProtagonistA looked ProtagonistA in the eye and said ,  It 's time for a change .  ProtagonistA was determined to make ProtagonistA's dreams a reality , and ProtagonistA was going to start right now . 
ProtagonistA rode ProtagonistA's yellow horse through the desert , looking for any sign of life . ProtagonistA had been riding for days , and was getting very tired . Finally , ProtagonistA came to a city where old walls and towers still stood . ProtagonistA rode through the city , and felt like something was watching ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA rode to the center of the city , and stopped . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was being watched , but ProtagonistA could n't see anyone . Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt something touch ProtagonistA's shoulder , and ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistB standing there . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was destined to be a great hero , and that ProtagonistA would save the world from a terrible fate . ProtagonistA was amazed , and did n't know what to say . ProtagonistB disappeared , and ProtagonistA was left alone in the city . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's destiny was to save the world , and ProtagonistA would do whatever it took to make sure that happened . 
ProtagonistA had a long way to go to reach the point when ProtagonistA could step into the kitchen without looking over ProtagonistA's shoulder . ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA was tired of being afraid . ProtagonistA was tired of looking over ProtagonistA's shoulder all the time , and ProtagonistA was ready to take a stand . ProtagonistA was ready to face ProtagonistA's fears and to fight for what ProtagonistA wanted . ProtagonistA was ready to be the man ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could be . 
ProtagonistA had been looking forward to ProtagonistB's visit all year . ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's only child , and ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was tall and lanky , with golden hair and tawny eyes . ProtagonistA pushed back ProtagonistB's heavy trunk and waded through the mud to the car . ProtagonistA was so excited to see ProtagonistB . Unfortunately , ProtagonistB was not excited to see ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB barely acknowledged ProtagonistA as ProtagonistB got out of the car and walked into the house . ProtagonistA's heart sank . ProtagonistA had been hoping for a warm reunion , but it was clear that ProtagonistB was not happy to be there . ProtagonistA tried to make the best of it , but it was clear that ProtagonistB was not interested in spending time with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB would go out with ProtagonistB's friends and come home late , barely speaking to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was hurt and disappointed , but ProtagonistA tried to understand . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was going through a tough time in ProtagonistB's life . One day , ProtagonistA came home and found ProtagonistB in the kitchen , crying . ProtagonistA sat down with ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what was wrong . ProtagonistB finally opened up to ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was struggling with ProtagonistB's mental health . ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA had had no idea . ProtagonistA listened as ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's struggles and ProtagonistB's fears . ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistB for being so brave and for opening up to ProtagonistA . They talked for hours , and ProtagonistA felt closer to ProtagonistB than ever before . Since that day , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB have been inseparable . They have a special bond that was forged through their shared experience . ProtagonistA is grateful that ProtagonistB came to visit , even though it was tough at first . ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistB is the most important person in ProtagonistA's life . 
ProtagonistA had been dreaming for more than two years , and right now the thought that ProtagonistA would have to die thrilled ProtagonistA more than anything else . ProtagonistA was lying in ProtagonistA's hospital bed , hooked up to a machine that beeped with ProtagonistA's heartbeat , a reminder that ProtagonistA was still alive . ProtagonistA was happy to know that ProtagonistA's time was almost up . ProtagonistA had been diagnosed with a terminal illness two years ago and given six months to live . But against all odds , ProtagonistA had held on . ProtagonistA had been through chemotherapy and radiation , but nothing had worked . ProtagonistA was tired of fighting , tired of being in pain . ProtagonistA was ready to go . Now , as ProtagonistA lay in ProtagonistA's hospital bed , ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would be leaving this world soon and that thought filled ProtagonistA with happiness . ProtagonistA was ready to meet whatever comes next . 
To ProtagonistB is very nearly a treasure , and though it is not proper to discuss the disposition of ProtagonistA before ProtagonistA has attained to a certain age , I shall say that the owner of the house opposite to which I am now sitting , and of a certain age there never was a person who , till ProtagonistA had reached ProtagonistA's twenty - first birthday , could not plainly distinguish ProtagonistA – those persons were all strangers to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB , on the other hand , though ProtagonistB is not yet twenty - one , has known ProtagonistA for some years , and likes ProtagonistA very much . 
ProtagonistA's 's a bully , is n't ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistA 's always picking on kids who are weaker than ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA 's never afraid to start a fight . Even the teachers are afraid of ProtagonistA . But one day , ProtagonistA went too far . ProtagonistA picked on a kid who was smaller than ProtagonistA , and the kid fought back . ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . The kid punched ProtagonistA right in the nose , and ProtagonistA ran away crying . ProtagonistA never picked on anyone again after that . 
It was a hot day , said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA sat down at the table in the dining - room , which was in the middle of the house . The sun was shining in through the windows and the room was very warm . ProtagonistA was sweating and ProtagonistA took off ProtagonistA's jacket and tie and unbuttoned ProtagonistA's shirt . ProtagonistA sat down and loosened ProtagonistA's belt . ProtagonistA was very hot and uncomfortable . Suddenly , the door opened and a gust of cool air came into the room . ProtagonistA felt relieved and ProtagonistA sat back in ProtagonistA's chair and closed ProtagonistA's eyes . 
ProtagonistA am a man of thirty - nine years , and a thousand and one years ago at the beginning of the twelfth century ProtagonistA , appeared in the court of the first emperor Constantine , who was a God of the Jews , and ordered the execution of four hundred and fifty - two religious and political persons . This act created a great rift in the empire , and ProtagonistA was forced to flee . ProtagonistA eventually made ProtagonistA's way to the court of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a wise and just ruler , and ProtagonistB saw the value in ProtagonistA's knowledge and experience . ProtagonistB appointed ProtagonistA as ProtagonistB's chief advisor , and ProtagonistA served ProtagonistB faithfully for many years . When ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistA retired from public life and lived out ProtagonistA's days in peace . 
ProtagonistA lay on the river bank , babbling in the shallow water of the river while the great army of the Lō̏kampans swept towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to die , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA had fought bravely and killed many of the enemy , but there were just too many of them . As they closed in on ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and thought of ProtagonistA's family . ProtagonistA hoped that they would be able to escape . 
In those days there was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was a good , honest man , and a man of sense , and ProtagonistA knew what was good for ProtagonistA ; and ProtagonistA was called Adam , and ProtagonistA was wise . And ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB's name was Eve , and ProtagonistB was a good woman , and ProtagonistB was called Eve , because ProtagonistB was the mother of all living . And they had two children , and their names were Cain and Abel . And they were good children , and they loved their parents , and they were called Cain and Abel , because they were the first children of the world . And they were happy , and they loved each other , and they were good to each other , and they were called Cain and Abel , because they were the first children of the world . 
ProtagonistA was a weak old man , but ProtagonistA had a good mind . ProtagonistA was always thinking of ways to make things better for ProtagonistA and others . One day , ProtagonistA came up with an invention that would help people with their daily tasks . ProtagonistA created a device that would allow people to do their work without having to use their hands . This invention would help many people and make their lives easier . ProtagonistA was very proud of ProtagonistA's invention and ProtagonistA knew that it would make a difference in the world . 
ProtagonistA was the very boss of all the soldiers , of the high school teachers , and even of the teachers ' wives . ProtagonistA had always said that the best way to get information out of ProtagonistB in the future was not to kill ProtagonistB , but to expose ProtagonistB , as ProtagonistB was known to the civilian world , to the light of ridicule . So when ProtagonistB was caught stealing a car , ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB paraded through the town square in a chicken suit . ProtagonistB was humiliated and laughed at by everyone who saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would never want to be exposed to that kind of ridicule again , and ProtagonistB would be more likely to cooperate in the future . 
In the summer of that year , 1577 , ProtagonistA wrote a letter to the Golden Bough , in the neighbourhood of Jermyn , in Yorkshire , where ProtagonistA then was living , in which ProtagonistA says:I have been thinking a great deal about our conversation the other day , and ProtagonistA have come to the conclusion that you were right and ProtagonistA was wrong . ProtagonistA have been living in this neighbourhood for some time , and ProtagonistA have come to know the people and the land quite well . And ProtagonistA must say that ProtagonistA have never seen anything like the Golden Bough . It is truly a magical place . ProtagonistA do n't know how you do it , but everything you touch seems to turn to gold . Your fruit and vegetables are the biggest and best ProtagonistA have ever seen , and your livestock are healthy and strong . It is no wonder that people come from all over to trade with you . ProtagonistA was a fool to think that ProtagonistA could compete with you . ProtagonistA see now that ProtagonistA was only deluding ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA do n't know how you do it , but ProtagonistA can see that it is something special that you have , something that ProtagonistA could never hope to match . ProtagonistA want to apologize for ProtagonistA's foolishness , and ProtagonistA want to thank you for your patience in dealing with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA hope that you will forgive ProtagonistA , and that we can still be friends . Yours truly , ProtagonistA  
Frank Wilson , an old friend and colleague of ProtagonistB's , once said ,  I am afraid , ProtagonistA , that when ProtagonistB is doing a little bit of necessary thing , you know all about it , and ProtagonistB 's got all sorts of things on ProtagonistB's conscience , but when ProtagonistB is doing all sorts of unnecessary thing , you never know what 's going on , you just know you 're used to it , and it 's when you 're doing a great deal of unnecessary thing that you really get into trouble .  
Siskais will not have noticed that the very day when ProtagonistA was to enrol in ProtagonistA's first year of school , ProtagonistB had ProtagonistA sent to the London School of Economics . It was only when ProtagonistB received a letter from the school informing ProtagonistB of ProtagonistA's admission that ProtagonistB realised what had happened . ProtagonistB was overjoyed that ProtagonistA would be able to get a good education and make something of ProtagonistA .

ProtagonistA had been warned about the city , about the dangers that lurked in the shadows , but ProtagonistA had not been prepared for what ProtagonistA saw . The poverty , the filth , the crime . It was all too much . ProtagonistA was on the verge of turning around and going back to the safety of the bank when ProtagonistA heard a scream . It sounded like it was coming from an alleyway just off the main street . Without thinking , ProtagonistA ran towards the sound . As ProtagonistA turned into the alley , ProtagonistA saw a group of men surrounding ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was cowering in fear , and it was clear that ProtagonistB was in trouble . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA was just a fourth year student . ProtagonistA was n't a hero . But ProtagonistA had to do something . ProtagonistA stepped forward and spoke in a voice that ProtagonistA hoped was more confident than ProtagonistA felt .  Leave ProtagonistB alone . The men turned to look at ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA saw the hunger in their eyes . They were going to hurt ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA could n't let that happen . ProtagonistA reached into ProtagonistA's pocket and pulled out ProtagonistA's wand . ProtagonistA pointed it at the men and shouted ,  Stupefy!Nothing happened . The men laughed and advanced on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was in trouble now . There was no way that ProtagonistA could fight all of them off . But ProtagonistA had to try . ProtagonistA threw ProtagonistA at the nearest man , punching and kicking with all ProtagonistA's might . It was pointless . The man just brushed ProtagonistA aside and kept coming . ProtagonistA was knocked to the ground . ProtagonistA tried to get up , but ProtagonistA was too weak . The men were upon ProtagonistA now , kicking and punching ProtagonistA .

And ProtagonistA 's happy to have finally found a way to share ProtagonistA's love of the library with others . 
In the midst of the streets of Alexandria , in the year 1659 , ProtagonistA , not unnaturally , but simply by habit , but the more naturally , since ProtagonistA was the son of it , took up ProtagonistA's residence in a large and commodious house in the very centre of the city , and there , like a good landlord , ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB's name was Mrs. Brown , and ProtagonistB was a very good woman , and ProtagonistB managed the house very well , and ProtagonistA was very well satisfied with ProtagonistB . But one day ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA and said to ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB am going to leave ProtagonistA .   What for , ProtagonistB ?  said ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB am going to get married , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB .  And who are ProtagonistB going to marry , ProtagonistB ?  said ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB am going to marry Mr. Jones , the baker ,  said ProtagonistB .  Very well , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistB will be happy .  
ProtagonistA's name was Chester , and ProtagonistA was thirty - four years old . ProtagonistA was a big man , with a bushy beard and a hearty laugh . ProtagonistA loved to fish , and ProtagonistA was always the first one out on the boat . ProtagonistA was a good man , and ProtagonistA was loved by all who knew ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA went out fishing with ProtagonistA's friends , and ProtagonistA never came back . ProtagonistA's body was found floating in the water , and it is believed that ProtagonistA drowned . ProtagonistA was a good man , and ProtagonistA will be missed by all who knew ProtagonistA . 
The air grew still as ProtagonistA entered the main door of the old office , but ProtagonistA was ready . ProtagonistA had been planning this for months and ProtagonistA was not going to let anything stop ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA walked calmly to the desk of ProtagonistB and pulled out a gun .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said ,  but ProtagonistA 'm going to have to ask ProtagonistB to leave .  ProtagonistB gasped and ran out of the room . ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB's footsteps echo down the hallway as ProtagonistB ran to get help . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA did n't have much time . ProtagonistA went to the first door on the left and opened it . Inside was a small office with a desk and a computer . ProtagonistA went to the desk and sat down in the chair . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be quick . ProtagonistA typed in the username and password that ProtagonistA had been given . Then ProtagonistA opened the file that ProtagonistA was looking for . ProtagonistA quickly scanned through it , looking for the information ProtagonistA needed . ProtagonistA found what ProtagonistA was looking for and copied it to a USB drive . Then ProtagonistA heard footsteps coming down the hallway . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to go . ProtagonistA put the USB drive in ProtagonistA's pocket and ran out of the room . ProtagonistA could hear the footsteps getting closer , but ProtagonistA did n't look back . ProtagonistA ran to the main door and opened it . Then ProtagonistA was outside . ProtagonistA ran down the street and did n't stop until ProtagonistA was safe . 
ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's bony hands and feet enough to accommodate ProtagonistA to a load of cushions ; they made a little coffin for ProtagonistA , so heavy it contained four bales of straw . The funeral was a sombre affair ; ProtagonistA's friends and family all wept , and ProtagonistA was too weak to stand . ProtagonistA had been ill for some time , and it was only a matter of time before ProtagonistA passed away . Still , it was a shock to everyone when it finally happened . ProtagonistA was a good man , and ProtagonistA will be missed . 
ProtagonistA had been walking ProtagonistA's entire life . ProtagonistA was seventeen , ProtagonistA had a job , and ProtagonistA was going to go to Hogwarts . ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a wizard , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to get ProtagonistA's chance . ProtagonistA had never been very good at school , but ProtagonistA was determined to try ProtagonistA's best . ProtagonistA arrived at Hogwarts and was sorted into Gryffindor . ProtagonistA was excited to be in the same house as Harry Potter . ProtagonistA quickly made friends with the other students and started to enjoy ProtagonistA's classes . ProtagonistA was especially good at Defense Against the Dark Arts . ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA belonged at Hogwarts . ProtagonistA loved the feeling of being surrounded by magic . ProtagonistA even started to think that maybe , just maybe , ProtagonistA could be a great wizard one day . 
When ProtagonistA left the village at seventeen years of age and started for the farm , ProtagonistA was a lanky little fellow , and although ProtagonistA was not accustomed to the rough country life and the heat of the winter , yet ProtagonistA was not destitute of good sense or good sense , however hardened and difficult this may have been for ProtagonistA ; and in these latter points ProtagonistA was very faithful indeed ; for ProtagonistA always had in ProtagonistA's mind one thing in mind ; that ProtagonistA ought to be a farmer , even though ProtagonistA might have to starve . The first few months were very hard for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was not used to the hard work and the long hours . ProtagonistA was often tired and hungry . But ProtagonistA persevered . ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA wanted to be a farmer , ProtagonistA had to tough it out . Eventually , ProtagonistA started to get the hang of things . ProtagonistA learned how to work the land and how to care for the animals . ProtagonistA even started to enjoy the simple life . ProtagonistA was proud of ProtagonistA's accomplishments and knew that ProtagonistA had made the right decision in leaving the village . Although ProtagonistA was still lanky , ProtagonistA had become a strong and capable young man . ProtagonistA had proven to ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could make it as a farmer . And ProtagonistA was determined to continue to succeed in this new life that ProtagonistA had chosen for ProtagonistA . 
On the very day the world was to begin to change , ProtagonistA , did the most ridiculous thing that ever happened to ProtagonistA , and that is to have succeeded in changing the most important meeting of the village house into a hideous pantomime of torture , murder , and mayhem . The villagers were gathered around the fire , preparing to discuss the important matters of the day , when ProtagonistA came barging into the house , screaming and covered in blood . ProtagonistA had evidently gone mad , and the villagers were terrified . ProtagonistA continued ProtagonistA's rampage , killing anyone who got in ProtagonistA's way , until finally the village elder managed to calm ProtagonistA down . ProtagonistA was taken away to be locked up , and the village house was left in ruins . 
Not long ago ProtagonistA came at last to ProtagonistA's senses , and thought that ProtagonistA must be out of a job . ProtagonistA had worked hard for years , but it seemed that ProtagonistA's efforts had gone unnoticed . ProtagonistA's boss never had a kind word to say , and ProtagonistA's coworkers always seemed to be getting ahead while ProtagonistA stayed in the same place . ProtagonistA decided that it was time to make a change . ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's boss and handed in ProtagonistA's resignation . ProtagonistA's boss was surprised , but ProtagonistA was firm in ProtagonistA's decision . ProtagonistA was done with this job . ProtagonistA was done with feeling like ProtagonistA was invisible . It was time to move on to something new . ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA's next step would be , but ProtagonistA was ready to find out . ProtagonistA was ready to start fresh and finally be happy with ProtagonistA's career . 
There was once a man who was well known , and known very well , for the one thing ProtagonistA had in common with every other man in the world , though ProtagonistA did not know it at the time ProtagonistA was doing what every other man in the world did , ProtagonistA had in common with the man who was named Thomas , with the same qualifications , and quite at the same time , however , ProtagonistA possessed some things which no man in the world possessed : ProtagonistA had both the good and the bad of the human species ; and there is no one who finds more good in human nature than the man who has done no other good than what ProtagonistA had done on ProtagonistA's own account , but had done it all on the goodwill of ProtagonistA's country and ProtagonistA's countrymen . 
ProtagonistA was always a little too young to know what ProtagonistA really wanted , that was , except perhaps to know what ProtagonistA was really afraid of . ProtagonistA was afraid of the dark , of course , and of spiders , and of heights . But those were things that everyone was afraid of , so they did n't really count . What ProtagonistA was really afraid of was ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was afraid of what ProtagonistA might become if ProtagonistA ever let ProtagonistA go . ProtagonistA was afraid of losing control and becoming a monster . That was why ProtagonistA always tried to be so good , to keep ProtagonistA in check . But one day , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA could n't keep running from ProtagonistA's fears forever . So ProtagonistA decided to face them head on . ProtagonistA went into the darkness , ProtagonistA faced ProtagonistA's fears , and ProtagonistA conquered them . And in doing so , ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistA was stronger than ProtagonistA ever could have imagined . 
ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer . As a child , ProtagonistA would lie in bed at night and dream of far - off places and adventures . ProtagonistA would imagine ProtagonistA as a brave knight , saving a beautiful princess from a dragon , or a daring explorer , discovering new lands and treasures . In ProtagonistA's dreams , anything was possible . As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to realize that life was not always like ProtagonistA's dreams . The world was a tough place , and happy endings were few and far between . ProtagonistA still held on to ProtagonistA's dreams , but ProtagonistA also learned to be realistic . If all ProtagonistA had ever wanted was a happy ending , ProtagonistA would have taken it . But ProtagonistA knew that there was more to life than just happiness . There was adventure , and discovery , and ProtagonistA was determined to find ProtagonistA's own path in life , no matter what it took . 
ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB . It was the same look ProtagonistB always gave when ProtagonistB managed to get one over on someone . In this case , it was the other kids in ProtagonistA's class . They had been teasing ProtagonistA all day about ProtagonistA's new shoes , saying they were too big for ProtagonistA and that ProtagonistA looked like a clown . But ProtagonistB had told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could wear them with pride , because they were the latest style and ProtagonistA was ahead of the trends . Now , as ProtagonistA watched the other kids ' jaws drop in envy , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB had been right . 
When ProtagonistA was little , ProtagonistA always had a great imagination . ProtagonistA was always asking questions and trying to learn more about the world around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's curiosity was endless , and ProtagonistA loved to explore . ProtagonistA would often go on adventures in ProtagonistA's mind , and ProtagonistA was always the hero . ProtagonistA never gave up , no matter how difficult the challenge . ProtagonistA was always determined to find the answer , and ProtagonistA always did . 
ProtagonistA , of course , corrects the usual scale , does not include the perils of infancy , such as the dread of drowning ; but there is no doubt that , all things considered , ProtagonistA is an individual of prodigious intelligence . This was evident from the very beginning , when ProtagonistA was born two weeks early and without any complications . The doctors were amazed , and ProtagonistA's parents were overjoyed . ProtagonistA's parents had always wanted a smart child , and they were not disappointed . From the time ProtagonistA could talk , ProtagonistA was asking questions and making observations that showed ProtagonistA was far ahead of ProtagonistA's peers . ProtagonistA started reading early , and by the time ProtagonistA was in kindergarten , ProtagonistA was reading at a college level . ProtagonistA's parents were proud of ProtagonistA's accomplishments , but they were also worried about ProtagonistA . They knew that ProtagonistA was different from other children , and they worried that ProtagonistA would be teased or bullied . They need n't have worried , though ; ProtagonistA was always able to hold ProtagonistA's own , whether it was in an argument or a physical fight . As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA's intelligence only became more apparent . ProtagonistA skipped several grades in school , and ProtagonistA graduated from college at the age of 20 . ProtagonistA then went on to get a PhD in physics , and ProtagonistA is now one of the leading experts in the field . ProtagonistA's parents are now retired , and they spend their days bragging to their friends about ProtagonistA . They are proud of ProtagonistA's accomplishments , and they know that ProtagonistA has only just begun to make ProtagonistA's mark on the world . 
As the story of the life of ProtagonistA begins , we should recall that the man who first wrote about ProtagonistA , a man called Sir Walter Scott , is dead . This is not to say that ProtagonistA is unimportant , but rather that ProtagonistA's story has been told by someone who is no longer with us . Nevertheless , ProtagonistA's story is worth telling , and it begins with ProtagonistA's birth in a small town in England . ProtagonistA was born into a family of modest means , but ProtagonistA was always a bright and cheerful child . ProtagonistA had a natural affinity for learning , and ProtagonistA excelled in ProtagonistA's studies . When ProtagonistA was old enough , ProtagonistA went to university and studied to become a lawyer . ProtagonistA was an excellent student , and ProtagonistA soon became one of the most respected lawyers in England . ProtagonistA's life was not all work and no play , however . ProtagonistA was an avid sportsman , and ProtagonistA enjoyed spending time outdoors . ProtagonistA was also a talented musician , and ProtagonistA often played the violin in ProtagonistA's spare time . ProtagonistA was a kind and generous man , and ProtagonistA was always ready to help those in need . ProtagonistA was loved by all who knew ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA will be sorely missed . 
I was walking through the library when I saw ProtagonistA . I knew that ProtagonistA worked there , so I asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA could give me a free copy of the dictionary . ProtagonistA told me that ProtagonistA could not do that , but ProtagonistA would give me the manual . I was so happy that I thanked ProtagonistA and took the manual . 
There was ProtagonistA ; or ProtagonistA was both , or neither . It was hard to tell with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always so vague and evasive . But that was part of ProtagonistA's charm , was n't it ? The mystery of ProtagonistA . No one could ever quite figure ProtagonistA out . Even ProtagonistA's closest friends did n't really know who ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA was like a chameleon , always changing and adaptable . ProtagonistA was never the same person for long . But that was what made ProtagonistA so special . ProtagonistA was always an enigma , always keeping people guessing . And that was what made ProtagonistA so fascinating . 
There is a place on a very small and very remote island in the Pacific where one can go into the deepest secrets of nature and find ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA is a very old and very wise man who has been living on the island for many years . ProtagonistA knows all about the plants and animals that live there , and ProtagonistA can tell you all about the history of the island and its people . 
ProtagonistA was a bad cook and a bad soldier , and ProtagonistA died of a broken heart . ProtagonistA was always getting into trouble and making a mess of things . ProtagonistA's commanding officer always had to yell at ProtagonistA and tell ProtagonistA off . ProtagonistA did n't care though . ProtagonistA was just happy to be in the army . One day , ProtagonistA's unit was sent into battle . They were outnumbered and outgunned , and ProtagonistA knew that they did n't stand a chance . But ProtagonistA fought anyway . ProtagonistA fought with all ProtagonistA's heart , even though ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die . And die ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA was shot through the heart and killed instantly . As ProtagonistA lay dying , ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistA's family and how much ProtagonistA loved them . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could have been a better son and a better brother . But it was too late now . ProtagonistA was gone . 
Barefoot lay by the side of ProtagonistB's house in the woods of Gower , where ProtagonistA had spent the good part of ProtagonistA's childhood , weeping heartily over ProtagonistB's death . ProtagonistA had loved ProtagonistB dearly , and ProtagonistB's passing had left a great hole in ProtagonistA's heart . The sun was setting , and the woods were beginning to fill with shadows . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should get up and go home , but ProtagonistA could n't bear to leave the spot where ProtagonistB had died . ProtagonistA lay there for a long time , until ProtagonistA finally fell into a fitful sleep . ProtagonistA was awakened by a rustling in the bushes . ProtagonistA sat up , heart pounding , and saw a large , furry creature standing in the clearing , looking at ProtagonistA with intelligent eyes . ProtagonistA froze , not knowing what to do . The creature took a step forward , and ProtagonistA scrambled to ProtagonistA's feet and ran as fast as ProtagonistA could back to ProtagonistB's house . ProtagonistA did n't stop running until ProtagonistA was safely inside , with the door bolted shut behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA never went back to that part of the woods again , but ProtagonistA always wondered what that creature had been . Was it a bear ? A wolf ? Or something else entirely ? ProtagonistA would never know for sure , but the experience had left ProtagonistA with a lifelong love of animals . 
ProtagonistA had a rough day . ProtagonistA lost ProtagonistA's wallet on ProtagonistA's way to work and had to borrow money from ProtagonistA's co - workers just to make it through the day . ProtagonistA was really looking forward to getting home , but when ProtagonistA got to the bus stop , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA did n't have enough money for the fare . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . Just then , ProtagonistB approached ProtagonistA and asked if ProtagonistA needed help . ProtagonistA explained ProtagonistA's situation and ProtagonistB offered to give ProtagonistA a penny - a - penny lift home . ProtagonistA was so grateful and ProtagonistA promised to pay ProtagonistB back as soon as ProtagonistA could . ProtagonistB was true to ProtagonistB's word and ProtagonistA made it home safely . ProtagonistA was so thankful for ProtagonistB's help and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB's kindness . 
There were many things that ProtagonistA said that were not true , and some that ProtagonistA said that was not true , but there was one thing that ProtagonistA said or that ProtagonistA said or did or said or said that was true . It was true that ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB with all of ProtagonistA's heart . 
ProtagonistA's friend was always telling ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had a good eye . ProtagonistA took this to heart and made sure to always be on the lookout for anything that could make ProtagonistA some money . ProtagonistA was always on the lookout for deals and opportunities to make a quick buck . As a result , ProtagonistA's friend was always telling ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was a smart and savvy investor . 
ProtagonistA had left home for the first time when ProtagonistA was thirteen . ProtagonistA had been excited to finally be out on ProtagonistA's own and to have some adventures . But , ProtagonistA quickly found out that ProtagonistB was possessed . This was a shock to ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA had always thought ProtagonistB was a good man . But , ProtagonistA soon realized that the possession had changed ProtagonistB and that ProtagonistB was now a danger to ProtagonistA and to others . ProtagonistA had to find a way to stop ProtagonistB and to save ProtagonistB from the possession . 
For the past two weeks , ProtagonistA had been a hulking , cold - eyed thing , a monster of the Most Horrific , though some described ProtagonistA as placid . ProtagonistA had been locked away in a cell , chained to the wall and left to rot . But ProtagonistA was not a monster , at least not anymore . ProtagonistA had once been a man , a husband and a father . But that was before the incident . Now , ProtagonistA was a shell of ProtagonistA's former self . ProtagonistA's eyes were sunken in , ProtagonistA's skin was pale and ProtagonistA's hair was matted . ProtagonistA barely spoke , and when ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA's voice was a raspy whisper . ProtagonistA was a shadow of the man ProtagonistA once was . The incident had happened two weeks ago . ProtagonistA had been out for a walk , enjoying the sunny day , when ProtagonistA was attacked . ProtagonistA could n't remember much of what happened , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had been bitten . The next thing ProtagonistA knew , ProtagonistA was waking up in a cell , chained to the wall . At first , ProtagonistA had been confused , but then the memories had started to come back to ProtagonistA . The memories of the people ProtagonistA had killed , the blood ProtagonistA had drunk . ProtagonistA was a monster , a vampire . And ProtagonistA had been locked away to prevent ProtagonistA from harming anyone else . But ProtagonistA was n't a monster anymore . The bite had turned ProtagonistA , made ProtagonistA into one of the undead . And now , ProtagonistA was craving human blood . ProtagonistA could smell it , taste it , and it was making ProtagonistA crazy . The past two weeks had been torture for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had been chained up , starved , and left to suffer . But now , ProtagonistA was free . The cell door had been left unlocked , and ProtagonistA had finally been able to escape . ProtagonistA was weak , but ProtagonistA was still able to walk . ProtagonistA staggered out of the cell and into the night . The first thing ProtagonistA saw was a human , a man , walking down the street . ProtagonistA's eyes widened and ProtagonistA licked ProtagonistA's lips . ProtagonistA was so thirsty , so hungry . ProtagonistA staggered towards the man , ready to feast . 
The summer ProtagonistA left home , ProtagonistA lost an arm . It was a tragic accident that happened while ProtagonistA was working at the local sawmill . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to make it through life without ProtagonistA's arm . Thankfully , ProtagonistA's family was there for ProtagonistA . They helped ProtagonistA through the tough times and encouraged ProtagonistA to keep going . ProtagonistA eventually went back to work at the sawmill , and ProtagonistA 's now doing better than ever . ProtagonistA 's even managed to find love again . 
Some days ago I was sitting down at the kitchen table at Mary 's to finish a little bill for the woodworking shop , when I began to recall a good while back my father , who was a good - looking , well - to - do farmer who had in the last few years become a very wealthy man not only of ProtagonistA's own land but of ProtagonistA's own money , and who had been very careful , as a matter of course , to keep up with all the latest inventions and discoveries made in the field of agriculture , and who had , as a good - natured example , added to the wealth of ProtagonistA's country an immense amount , and whom I have never forgotten ProtagonistA's great credit to maintain because ProtagonistA had carried on the work of ProtagonistA's father at the same time of doing it , though not without much expense , and had yet enabled ProtagonistA to do much more than ProtagonistA had done before . 
ProtagonistA glared at ProtagonistB , vigorously stirring the bowl of frosting . ProtagonistA had the foul look of the psychotic . It was clear that ProtagonistA was not going to let ProtagonistB ruin ProtagonistA's cake . ProtagonistA would not let ProtagonistB take away ProtagonistA's happiness . ProtagonistA had always loved baking . It was ProtagonistA's passion . ProtagonistA loved the way the batter came together , the way the cake rose in the oven , and the way the frosting turned out . ProtagonistA was always so proud of ProtagonistA's cakes . But lately , something had been off . ProtagonistA's cakes were still delicious , but they were n't quite the same . They were missing that special something that made them ProtagonistA's cakes . ProtagonistA had tried everything ProtagonistA could think of , but nothing worked . ProtagonistA had even asked ProtagonistB for help , but ProtagonistB had just laughed and told ProtagonistA to give up . But ProtagonistA was n't going to give up . ProtagonistA was going to find out what was wrong with ProtagonistA's cakes , and ProtagonistA was going to fix it . ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear ProtagonistB come up behind ProtagonistA . What are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked , ProtagonistB's voice dripping with disdain . ProtagonistA jumped , and the bowl of frosting toppled over . You idiot !  ProtagonistB shouted .  ProtagonistA 've ruined ProtagonistB's cake!Bob 's face turned red with anger . ProtagonistA had had enough of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was done with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA picked up the bowl of frosting and threw it at ProtagonistB , hitting ProtagonistB square in the face . You're lucky ProtagonistB do n't have a wand , because ProtagonistB would hex ProtagonistA into oblivion ,  ProtagonistB spat . ProtagonistB turned and stormed out of the kitchen , leaving ProtagonistA standing there , victorious . 
There was once a year when the grapevines were ripe and they were ready to sing . ProtagonistA went to the Fountain of the Red Gallows in west and north - east France , and there fell from the sky ten thousand pretty little green hens . It was so miraculous that they all thought ProtagonistA had done it many times over . 
ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could get away with anything . ProtagonistA was a gambler and a con artist , and ProtagonistA had never been caught . But ProtagonistA also knew that it was n't safe to gamble away an airship . ProtagonistA muttered this to ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA trudged through the rush of traffic . ProtagonistA had been caught this time , and ProtagonistA knew it was only a matter of time before ProtagonistA was sent to prison . ProtagonistA was regretting ProtagonistA's decision to gamble away the airship now , but it was too late . ProtagonistA would have to face the consequences of ProtagonistA's actions . 
It was around eleven o'clock and it had been almost two months since ProtagonistB had died — three , in fact , if you include the time ProtagonistA 'd spent in temporary hospital and the time of great pain and suffering ProtagonistA 'd been through . ProtagonistA had been living with ProtagonistA's father since then , and though ProtagonistA was grateful for the support , ProtagonistA found the house to be incredibly lonely without ProtagonistB's presence . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB's cooking , ProtagonistB's laughter , and ProtagonistB's warm hugs . ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistB's old armchair , looking at old photos of ProtagonistB and trying to hold back the tears , when ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door . ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and was surprised to see ProtagonistC , standing on the doorstep . Hello , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said , smiling .  ProtagonistC hope ProtagonistA do n't mind ProtagonistC coming by , but ProtagonistC wanted to check on ProtagonistA and see how ProtagonistA 're doing . ProtagonistA invited ProtagonistC in , and they sat down in the living room and talked . It was so nice to have someone to talk to who understood what ProtagonistA was going through . ProtagonistC stayed for a cup of tea , and when ProtagonistC left , ProtagonistA felt just a little bit better . It was around eleven o'clock , and though it had been a tough few months , ProtagonistA was slowly starting to heal . 
After ProtagonistA was expelled from Hogwarts , ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA's life was over . ProtagonistA would never be as bright as ProtagonistA's father , and as bright as ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could be . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never find a place in the world where ProtagonistA belonged . But then ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a million miles away , but ProtagonistB was the one who showed ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could be anything ProtagonistA wanted to be . With ProtagonistB's help , ProtagonistA became an Auror , and ProtagonistA's mother became a million miles away . 
It was a short , hot afternoon at the end of August ; ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA , before the sun rose , that ProtagonistA was about to start ProtagonistA's night shift , and change ProtagonistA's clothes . ProtagonistA had been working the night shift for a few weeks now , and ProtagonistA was getting used to it . But ProtagonistA still missed the daytime . ProtagonistA missed the sun . But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to do what was best for ProtagonistA's family . And that meant working the night shift . ProtagonistA would be able to see ProtagonistA's wife and kids more during the day , and that was worth the sacrifice . ProtagonistA said goodbye to ProtagonistA's family and headed to work . ProtagonistA knew it was going to be a long night , but ProtagonistA was ready for it . 
ProtagonistA first came across time travelers in the nineteen - thirties , and ProtagonistA believed they could help ProtagonistA escape from a dangerous prison . ProtagonistA was serving a life sentence for a crime ProtagonistA did n't commit , and ProtagonistA was desperate to get out . ProtagonistA asked the time travelers to take ProtagonistA back in time so ProtagonistA could change the past and prevent the crime from happening . They agreed , and ProtagonistA was able to go back and save ProtagonistA from a fate worse than death . 
ProtagonistA was a simple man . ProtagonistA lived in a small town and worked as a farmer . ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life and did n't want for anything . One day , ProtagonistA was out working in ProtagonistA's fields when ProtagonistA heard a strange noise . It sounded like someone was crying . ProtagonistA followed the noise and it led ProtagonistA to a cave . Inside the cave , ProtagonistA found a creature that looked like a cross between a human and a goat . The creature was crying and ProtagonistA felt sorry for it . ProtagonistA asked the creature what was wrong and it said that it was lost and did n't know how to get home . ProtagonistA offered to help the creature and ProtagonistA took it back to ProtagonistA's farm . The creature , who ProtagonistA learned was called a Reckoner , ended up staying with ProtagonistA and became like a member of the family . ProtagonistA was happy to have found a new friend and ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA could help the Reckoner find its way home . 
Before ProtagonistA was a wizard , ProtagonistA had a poor childhood . ProtagonistA was always the last one picked for teams in school , and ProtagonistA was always the butt of jokes . ProtagonistA never had any friends , and ProtagonistA was always alone . But ProtagonistA never gave up , and ProtagonistA never stopped believing in ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA found a magic wand in the forest , and ProtagonistA became the greatest wizard in the land . ProtagonistA used ProtagonistA's powers to help others , and ProtagonistA made sure that everyone had a fair chance in life . ProtagonistA was finally happy , and ProtagonistA knew that it was all because ProtagonistA never gave up on ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA's youth was spent following in ProtagonistA's brother 's footsteps . ProtagonistA was interested in the same things as ProtagonistA's brother and was happy to partake in any activities that ProtagonistA's brother enjoyed . This made ProtagonistA happy and content in ProtagonistA's youth , but as ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to yearn for something more . ProtagonistA wanted to find ProtagonistA's own interests and hobbies , but no matter how hard ProtagonistA tried , ProtagonistA could n't seem to break away from ProtagonistA's brother 's shadow . It was n't until ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA finally found the courage to forge ProtagonistA's own path . With ProtagonistB's support , ProtagonistA was finally able to break free from ProtagonistA's brother 's influence and become ProtagonistA's own person . 
ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistA's fair share of pain , ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistA 'd been through a lot in ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA 'd never been one to shy away from a challenge . But this was different . This was something ProtagonistA could n't just push through . This was cancer . ProtagonistA had always been a fighter . ProtagonistA 'd never backed down from a fight , no matter how big or small . But cancer was different . It was an enemy ProtagonistA could n't see , could n't touch . It was an enemy that was slowly killing ProtagonistA from the inside out . ProtagonistA was scared . ProtagonistA was scared of the pain , the suffering , the inevitable . But ProtagonistA was also scared of leaving ProtagonistA's loved ones behind . ProtagonistA did n't want to die , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to face the facts . cancer was going to kill ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was at peace with ProtagonistA's decision . ProtagonistA knew it was time to let go . ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA's goodbyes to ProtagonistA's loved ones and ProtagonistA went into hospice care . It was hard for everyone , but it was what ProtagonistA wanted . ProtagonistA wanted to be comfortable and at peace in ProtagonistA's final days . And that 's exactly what ProtagonistA got . 
ProtagonistA was back in the Kremlin , slinging hints at ProtagonistB and son while ProtagonistA sat in ProtagonistA's comfortable chair . ProtagonistA had been gone for weeks on a business trip and was now ready to relax . ProtagonistB , however , was not as pleased to see ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB had been dealing with the children and the household on ProtagonistB's own and was not in the mood to entertain ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was undeterred . ProtagonistA continued to make suggestive comments , hoping to get a rise out of ProtagonistB . Eventually , ProtagonistB had had enough . ProtagonistB stood up and told ProtagonistA to leave . ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA had never been treated like this before . ProtagonistA quickly gathered ProtagonistA's things and left , vowing never to return . 
ProtagonistA had been with the family for years . ProtagonistA started as a young boy , working as a stable hand . Over time , ProtagonistA worked ProtagonistA's way up to become the head coachman . ProtagonistA was a fixture in the household and was well - loved by all . Sadly , over the years , ProtagonistA began to lose ProtagonistA's memory . ProtagonistA would forget things like the family 's names and ProtagonistA's duties around the house . The family did their best to keep ProtagonistA comfortable and safe , but eventually they realized that it was time for ProtagonistA to move into the servant 's quarters . ProtagonistA was sad to leave the family ProtagonistA had served for so many years , but ProtagonistA was content in ProtagonistA's new home . ProtagonistA loved spending time with the other servants and hearing about their lives . ProtagonistA was happy to have a place to call ProtagonistA's own and to be surrounded by people who loved ProtagonistA . 
There was once ProtagonistA , for ProtagonistA always had the same unkind name , and ProtagonistA never liked to be called that . ProtagonistA was always the butt of jokes , and ProtagonistA always felt like an outsider . One day , ProtagonistA decided enough was enough . ProtagonistA was going to change ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistA went to the courthouse and changed ProtagonistA's name to Robert . ProtagonistA felt like a new person . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA finally belonged . 
ProtagonistA's name is Harry Potter , insisted ProtagonistA , shrugging ProtagonistA's shoulders and turning ProtagonistA's attention to the board in ProtagonistA's hands , busy thinking about what ProtagonistA was going to do with ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA always thought about that , what ProtagonistA was going to do with ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA never really had a plan , but ProtagonistA always figured ProtagonistA 'd find ProtagonistA's way eventually . Now , here ProtagonistA was , at the age of 30 , still without a clue . ProtagonistA had a good job , sure , but it was n't ProtagonistA's dream job . ProtagonistA was n't doing what ProtagonistA loved . And ProtagonistA had no idea how to change that . ProtagonistA sighed and put the board down , getting up to pace around ProtagonistA's small apartment . ProtagonistA was restless , antsy , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to go crazy if ProtagonistA did n't do something soon . Suddenly , an idea came to ProtagonistA . It was a crazy idea , but it just might work . ProtagonistA would go on a journey , a journey to find ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA would leave everything behind and just go . It was a scary thought , but ProtagonistA was nothing if not brave . ProtagonistA could do this . ProtagonistA would do this . And maybe , just maybe , ProtagonistA would finally find what ProtagonistA was looking for . 
ProtagonistA had been searching for ProtagonistA's mother 's house for fifteen minutes . ProtagonistA had been walking around the neighborhood for hours , trying to find the right street . Finally , ProtagonistA came to the door of ProtagonistA's mother 's house . ProtagonistA knocked on the door , and ProtagonistA's mother answered . 
ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA often . ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's everything . ProtagonistB's reason for living . And so it was with ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA's soft skin , ProtagonistA's gentle touch , and ProtagonistA's beautiful smile . ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA's smell , ProtagonistA's taste , and the way ProtagonistA made ProtagonistB feel . ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA's laugh , ProtagonistA's voice , and the way ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA's love , ProtagonistA's passion , and the way ProtagonistA made ProtagonistB feel alive . 
It is to the great credit of ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA is now living . The only fault on which ProtagonistA is minded is that ProtagonistA has not yet regained the capacity of an adult man , but for whom , owing to the inherent value of youth and to ProtagonistA's own congenital beauty , the balance of society naturally imposed on ProtagonistA a certain age of vigor and of mature intellectual development . ProtagonistA's parents had died when ProtagonistA was young , and ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistA's grandparents . When they died , ProtagonistA was left alone in the world . ProtagonistA had no education and no job skills . ProtagonistA drifted from one place to another , living on the streets and doing odd jobs to get by . One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a kind man who took ProtagonistA in and gave ProtagonistA a job . ProtagonistA worked hard and soon learned all ProtagonistA needed to know to be a successful adult . ProtagonistB was like a father to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was grateful for all that ProtagonistB had done for ProtagonistA . Thanks to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was now a productive member of society . 
ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head dismissively as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB drift into the station carriages . It was clear that ProtagonistB was lost and did n't know where ProtagonistB was going . But ProtagonistA was n't going to help ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had enough problems of ProtagonistA's own . 
ProtagonistA was one of the most famous and respected minds of ProtagonistA's time , but ProtagonistA was neither a man of letters nor a man of ideas . ProtagonistA was a man of action , and ProtagonistA's actions spoke louder than any words could have . ProtagonistA was a leader , and ProtagonistA inspired others to follow ProtagonistA's example . ProtagonistA was a doer , and ProtagonistA got things done . ProtagonistA was a man of ProtagonistA's word , and ProtagonistA always kept ProtagonistA's promises . ProtagonistA was a man of integrity , and ProtagonistA always did what ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA would do . ProtagonistA was a man of principle , and ProtagonistA always stood up for what ProtagonistA believed in . ProtagonistA was a man of courage , and ProtagonistA was never afraid to take on a challenge . ProtagonistA was a man of vision , and ProtagonistA always saw the potential in others . ProtagonistA was a man of wisdom , and ProtagonistA always knew what was best for those around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a man of love , and ProtagonistA always put others first . ProtagonistA was one of the most famous and respected minds of ProtagonistA's time , and ProtagonistA will always be remembered for ProtagonistA's greatness . 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was suspicious of ProtagonistB because ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB was either a prostitute or an insane person . ProtagonistA did n't like either of them , so ProtagonistA walked away . 
There was once an old farmer in Oxfordshire , now dead and gone , who had lived long enough to see the day when playthings had their proper uses — when industry , rather than mere wit , was the proper measure of man 's worth ; when the frivolous avocations of childish boys , once well nigh spent , had in their turn given place to the occupations which distinguished the most respectable members of society ; when the good sense of the courts of law had been fairly given due regard , so that many of those cases in which society had once regarded as frivolous or trivial — and this was for the most part , indeed , the case , in which the good sense of the law had not in any way sufficed , but which were , or at any rate were , fairly decided by an inexperienced judge , who was , or rather was , permitted to decide them , according to the rules of the game — such were the days of ProtagonistA , when , as ProtagonistA was often apt to say , it was a game of chance , ye good folk   ( ProtagonistA was well aware that what ProtagonistA was about to say was absolutely true)—and it was a game of chance , as well as a game of chance ; for , when ProtagonistB is in possession of a fortune , it is very seldom that ProtagonistB finds ProtagonistB in possession of nothing but ProtagonistB's own mind and the power of ProtagonistB's imagination ; but as a matter of fact , it is most often the case that ProtagonistB finds ProtagonistB in possession of a fortune , not only owing to circumstances of fortune , but owing to the power of ProtagonistB's imagination . 
ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA does n't have time to explain . ProtagonistA 's a busy man and ProtagonistA 's got places to be . But I was persistent . I wanted to know what was going on . I wanted to know why ProtagonistA was acting so strange . Please , ProtagonistA ,  I begged .  Just tell me what 's going on . I 'm ProtagonistA's friend . I care about ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA sighed . ProtagonistA knew I would n't let up until ProtagonistA told me .  Okay ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'll tell you . But you have to promise not to tell anyone . I promised . And then ProtagonistA told me ProtagonistA's secret . ProtagonistA 's been seeing a therapist . ProtagonistA 's been struggling with ProtagonistA's mental health for a while now and ProtagonistA finally decided to seek help . I'm so proud of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  I said .  ProtagonistA 're doing the right thing . ProtagonistA nodded .  ProtagonistA know ,  ProtagonistA said .  It 's just been really tough . But ProtagonistA 'm getting better . ProtagonistA 'm slowly but surely getting better . I hugged ProtagonistA . I was so happy that ProtagonistA was finally getting the help ProtagonistA needed . And I was glad that ProtagonistA felt comfortable enough to tell me . It just goes to show that you never really know what someone is going through . 
Hush , ProtagonistB , said the gleam in ProtagonistA's eyes as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB run barefoot through the streets of London . It was a cold night , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be cold and hungry by the time ProtagonistA got back to their squat . But ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistB would never admit it . ProtagonistA had been living on the streets of London for years , and ProtagonistA knew how to take care of ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistB was new to the streets , and ProtagonistA had taken ProtagonistB under ProtagonistA's wing . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was a good kid , despite ProtagonistB's circumstances , and ProtagonistA wanted to help ProtagonistB however ProtagonistA could . Tonight , ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB pickpocket a wealthy - looking woman on the street . ProtagonistA had been about to intervene , but then ProtagonistA saw the gleam in ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB needed the money more than the woman did , and so ProtagonistA let ProtagonistB go . Now , as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB run away , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had made the right decision . ProtagonistB might not be able to take care of ProtagonistB yet , but ProtagonistB was a survivor . And ProtagonistA knew that , given time , ProtagonistB would make it on the streets just like ProtagonistA had . 
I have stayed on at ProtagonistA's Hotel since the Titanic disappeared ; and if there was ever any doubt as to the character of ProtagonistA , it proved in every respect that ProtagonistA was as much a gentleman as a gentleman could be . ProtagonistA was always courteous and considerate , never failing to go out of ProtagonistA's way to make sure that ProtagonistA's guests were comfortable and happy . ProtagonistA was a true gentleman in every sense of the word . 
The young men of the time of King Arthur stared at ProtagonistA , to see if ProtagonistA were really what they had supposed ProtagonistA to be . ProtagonistA was a strange looking man , with a long beard and wild hair . ProtagonistA wore a tunic of animal skin and carried a large sword . ProtagonistA did not look like a king , or a lord , or even a knight . ProtagonistA looked like a barbarian . The young men were not sure what to make of ProtagonistA . They had heard stories of a great warrior who had come from the north to help King Arthur in his fight against the Saxons . ProtagonistA was said to be a mighty warrior , with the strength of ten men . The young men had never seen anything like ProtagonistA before . ProtagonistA stepped forward and spoke in a deep , booming voice .  ProtagonistA am Bob , the warrior from the north . ProtagonistA have come to help King Arthur in his fight against the Saxons . ProtagonistA am a mighty warrior , with the strength of ten men . ProtagonistA will help you defeat the Saxons and drive them out of Britain . The young men were impressed by ProtagonistA's words . They believed that ProtagonistA could help them defeat the Saxons . They cheered and welcomed ProtagonistA into their ranks . ProtagonistA would help them drive the Saxons out of Britain and make King Arthur 's dream of a united Britain a reality . 
ProtagonistA had been the last of the contestants , but ProtagonistA 'd won . ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA 'd finally won something after years of entering contests and never winning . ProtagonistA was especially happy because ProtagonistA 'd won a trip to the Bahamas . ProtagonistA was going to be able to spend a week in the sun , relaxing and enjoying ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was going to make sure that ProtagonistA took advantage of every minute of ProtagonistA's trip . 
ProtagonistA had always loved the rain . As a child , ProtagonistA would run outside and dance in the rain , spinning and twirling until ProtagonistA was soaked through to the bone . ProtagonistA's mother would scold ProtagonistA and tell ProtagonistA to come inside , but ProtagonistA never listened . ProtagonistA loved the feeling of the rain on ProtagonistA's skin , the way it made ProtagonistA's hair stick to ProtagonistA's forehead and ProtagonistA's clothes cling to ProtagonistA's body . Now , as an adult , ProtagonistA still loved the rain . But ProtagonistA no longer ran outside and danced in it . Instead , ProtagonistA sat by the window and watched as the raindrops fell , each one making a different pattern on the glass . It was a rainy Saturday afternoon in September , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA thinking about the house ProtagonistA had lived in when ProtagonistA was a child . ProtagonistA remembered the ghost house ProtagonistA had seen in the woods and the tall , lopsided tree ProtagonistA had dreamed of jumping from . ProtagonistA also remembered the moon floating in the sky on that rainy night so long ago . ProtagonistA sighed and stood up , stretching ProtagonistA's arms above ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA was about to go make ProtagonistA a cup of tea when ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door . ProtagonistA opened it to find ProtagonistB , standing on the doorstep with an umbrella . ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA's car in the driveway and thought ProtagonistA might want some company ,  ProtagonistB said with a smile . ProtagonistA smiled back and invited ProtagonistB inside . ProtagonistA was glad for the company on this rainy day . 
Unlike many high - class accountants in Paris , who ride in on a camel , or even a donkey , which is considerably larger , and which is slower than the standard coach , ProtagonistA rarely rode a mule , and ProtagonistA was very glad when ProtagonistA did ride a mule , because it enabled ProtagonistA to do all kinds of things within the limits of ProtagonistA's strength . On the day that ProtagonistA rode ProtagonistA's mule into the city , ProtagonistA was able to get a seat on the top of a double - decked bus , which was something that ProtagonistA had never been able to do before . 
By the time ProtagonistA was twelve , ProtagonistA was already thinking about winning the Quidditch World Cup . ProtagonistA had seen the Cup many times before , but never up close . It was always on display in the trophy room at Hogwarts , and ProtagonistA would often sneak in to take a look at it . ProtagonistA would imagine ProtagonistA lifting the Cup above ProtagonistA's head , surrounded by ProtagonistA's teammates and the cheering crowd . One day , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA's parents about ProtagonistA's dream . They laughed and said that it was a nice dream , but that it was never going to happen . ProtagonistA did n't give up though . ProtagonistA started practicing Quidditch in the backyard and became the captain of ProtagonistA's school team . By the time ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA was one of the best Quidditch players in the world . ProtagonistA led ProtagonistA's team to the Quidditch World Cup final , where they faced their biggest rivals . In a thrilling match , ProtagonistA scored the winning goal , and the Cup was finally ProtagonistA . 
There are many people who do not know it , but who know it very well , who say that men are born with ProtagonistA to . It is a very old saying , and one that is often repeated . ProtagonistA is a very important part of a man 's life , and without ProtagonistA , a man would not be complete . ProtagonistA is the one who gives a man his strength , his power , and his ability to love . ProtagonistA is the one who makes a man a man . 
ProtagonistA had no name , and no business of ProtagonistA's own , but ProtagonistA had been told many a great lie , and none of them made a hair 's breadth more certain . ProtagonistA had been told that ProtagonistA was special , that ProtagonistA was destined for greatness , that ProtagonistA was the chosen one . But ProtagonistA was just a man , and all men are destined to die . ProtagonistA had no name , but ProtagonistA had a purpose . ProtagonistA was going to find ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was going to make ProtagonistB pay . 
ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA had been in more wars than ProtagonistA could count and had seen more death than anyone should have to see . It is said that ProtagonistA had thought ProtagonistA dead more times than ProtagonistA cared to remember . But , somehow , ProtagonistA always managed to come out alive . ProtagonistA was a lucky man , some would say . ProtagonistA had seen a lot of death , but the one that always stuck with ProtagonistA was the death of ProtagonistB . They had served together in the war and had been through everything together . But , one day , ProtagonistB was killed in action . ProtagonistA never forgave ProtagonistA for not being able to save ProtagonistB . After the war , ProtagonistA tried to put ProtagonistA's life back together . ProtagonistA got a job and got married . ProtagonistA had a family and was happy for a time . But , the memories of war always haunted ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA would have nightmares and would wake up in a cold sweat . ProtagonistC tried to help ProtagonistA , but there was nothing ProtagonistC could do . Eventually , ProtagonistA's memories became too much for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's own life . It is said that ProtagonistA's last words were  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA should have saved ProtagonistB .  
ProtagonistA had never thought that ProtagonistA might one day make it to the top of Death . It was a mountain that had always loomed in the distance , but it seemed impossible to scale . ProtagonistA had never been a particularly athletic person , and the thought of climbing up the sheer face of the mountain was daunting . But one day , ProtagonistA decided to give it a try . ProtagonistA started off slow , but soon found ProtagonistA making good progress . With each step , ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's confidence grow . ProtagonistA was amazed that ProtagonistA was actually doing it ! As ProtagonistA reached the top , ProtagonistA was filled with a sense of accomplishment . ProtagonistA had never thought that ProtagonistA could do it , but ProtagonistA had . Death was no longer a mountain that loomed in the distance , but a conquered peak . 
ProtagonistA was driving up the hill when ProtagonistA drove ProtagonistA's horse into a deep ravine . The horse was stuck and could n't get out . ProtagonistA tried to help the horse , but it was too late . The horse died in the ravine . 
ProtagonistB had been best friends with ProtagonistA since they were in diapers . They had grown up together and now they were both in their early twenties . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a troublemaker , but ProtagonistB had always been there to help ProtagonistA out . Now , it seemed like ProtagonistA was in over ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA had gotten involved with some shady characters and ProtagonistB was worried ProtagonistA was going to get hurt . ProtagonistB decided it was ProtagonistB's duty to help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB went to talk to ProtagonistA's friends and tried to get them to convince ProtagonistA to get out of whatever ProtagonistA was involved in . But they were n't listening . ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB had to take matters into ProtagonistB's own hands . ProtagonistB went to talk to ProtagonistA and begged ProtagonistA to stop whatever ProtagonistA was doing . ProtagonistA finally agreed and ProtagonistB breathed a sigh of relief . ProtagonistB had done ProtagonistB's duty as a friend and ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistA would be okay now . 
ProtagonistA was always a studious boy , and ProtagonistA loved nothing more than spending time in ProtagonistA's large library . ProtagonistA would often spend hours in there , reading all the books ProtagonistA had on medical topics , as well as all the other books ProtagonistA had in ProtagonistA's room . ProtagonistA loved learning new things , and the library was ProtagonistA's favorite place to do it . One day , when ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's library , ProtagonistA came across a book that ProtagonistA had never seen before . It was called  The Book of Knowledge  , and it looked very old and dusty . ProtagonistA was curious , so ProtagonistA opened it up and started reading . ProtagonistA was amazed at what ProtagonistA found inside . The book was full of information on all sorts of topics , and ProtagonistA quickly realized that this was a very special book . ProtagonistA continued to read the book , and ProtagonistA learned more and more each day . ProtagonistA became an expert on many topics , and ProtagonistA even started teaching other people what ProtagonistA had learned . The book had made ProtagonistA into a very knowledgeable person , and ProtagonistA was very grateful to have found it . 
ProtagonistA had been fighting the Black Council for years . They were a powerful group of evil wizards who terrorized the kingdom . ProtagonistA had finally tracked them down to their castle and was ready to take them on . ProtagonistA charged into the castle , swords drawn . The Council was waiting for ProtagonistA , but they were no match for ProtagonistA's skills . ProtagonistA quickly dispatched them all and took control of the castle . Now that the Black Council was gone , the kingdom was finally at peace . ProtagonistA was hailed as a hero and lived happily ever after . 
ProtagonistA had been very quiet all morning , but when ProtagonistA woke up it was to breathe the first sound of life . It was a beautiful day outside , and ProtagonistA wanted to enjoy it . ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to the window , where ProtagonistA saw the sun shining and the birds singing . ProtagonistA smiled and went downstairs to start ProtagonistA's day . 
A guest of honour called upon ProtagonistA and asked ProtagonistA to write a letter to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was more than happy to oblige and set to work immediately . ProtagonistA wrote a beautiful letter , full of kind words and compliments . ProtagonistA expressed ProtagonistA's hope that ProtagonistB was well and that they might meet again soon . ProtagonistA signed off with ProtagonistA's best wishes and love . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would be touched by ProtagonistA's letter and that it would make ProtagonistB's day . 
ProtagonistA came to a house on a river that was looming ominously before ProtagonistA . It was a dark and stormy night , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA should n't go in . But the house called to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could n't resist its pull . ProtagonistA walked up to the door and knocked . There was no answer . ProtagonistA knocked again , harder this time . Still no answer . ProtagonistA tried the door handle , and to ProtagonistA's surprise , it turned . ProtagonistA slowly pushed the door open , half expecting something to jump out at ProtagonistA . But nothing did . ProtagonistA cautiously stepped inside . The house was dark and musty , and it felt like it had n't been lived in for years . ProtagonistA called out , but there was no response . ProtagonistA began to explore the house , and as ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA felt a presence following ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA turned around , but there was nothing there . ProtagonistA tried to shake off the feeling and continued exploring . ProtagonistA eventually made ProtagonistA's way to the basement , where ProtagonistA found a door that was slightly ajar . ProtagonistA pushed it open and walked inside . It was pitch black , and ProtagonistA could n't see anything . ProtagonistA took a few steps forward , and then ProtagonistA felt something wrap around ProtagonistA's leg and pull ProtagonistA into the darkness . 
ProtagonistA had brought home three sets of glasses and a large enough bag to keep them all , an obvious precaution since there was no way of knowing what ProtagonistA 'd be up against , especially when ProtagonistA was n't simply playing chess or poker or bowling . ProtagonistA was , after all , going to be a contestant on the new game show ,  The Maze . The premise of the show was simple enough . ProtagonistA and the other contestants would be dropped into a large maze , and they would have to find their way out . The first person to find the exit would win a cash prize . ProtagonistA had been preparing for the show for weeks , watching previous episodes and studying the layout of the maze . ProtagonistA was confident that ProtagonistA could win . The day of the show arrived , and ProtagonistA put on ProtagonistA's glasses and entered the maze . ProtagonistA immediately got turned around , and it soon became clear that the maze was much more complicated than ProtagonistA had anticipated . ProtagonistA could hear the other contestants behind ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't want to waste time looking for them . ProtagonistA continued to move forward , but it felt like ProtagonistA was going in circles . ProtagonistA was starting to get tired and frustrated . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard someone yell ,  I found the exit!Bob turned around and saw one of the other contestants running towards the exit . ProtagonistA was about to give up , but then ProtagonistA remembered the prize . ProtagonistA was n't going to let someone else win . ProtagonistA started running , and eventually ProtagonistA found the exit . ProtagonistA had won the game . 
As ProtagonistA thought , ProtagonistA lifted ProtagonistA's head up to look around ProtagonistA's bright blue house . And for a moment , ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA saw a long , dark , empty room , with little else than a door and a rickety stove . But then ProtagonistA blinked and the room was gone , replaced by ProtagonistA's usual cozy living room . ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head , wondering if ProtagonistA was just imagining things . 
ProtagonistA left the room and an amount of time must have elapsed since ProtagonistA had entered the room . ProtagonistA had dismissed the servants and had placed ProtagonistA's hand upon the double door , and had raised it slightly , so as to let the light of the morning through . ProtagonistA had wanted to be alone and think about what ProtagonistA was going to do next . ProtagonistA was getting too old for this life and ProtagonistA wanted out . ProtagonistA wanted to retire and live in peace . But ProtagonistA knew that was not going to happen . ProtagonistA was going to have to go out with a bang . ProtagonistA was going to have to go out in style . ProtagonistA was going to have to go out with a big explosion . That was the only way ProtagonistA knew how to go out . 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the barn , looking out over the field where ProtagonistB had once settled cattle . It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining . ProtagonistB had died a few years ago , and ProtagonistA had taken over the farm . ProtagonistA was doing ProtagonistA's best , but it was hard work . The farm was in good shape , but it was a lot of work for one person . ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistB and the good times they had had on the farm . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was doing what ProtagonistB would want ProtagonistA to do . ProtagonistA was keeping the farm going and making it successful . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the barn . ProtagonistA got up to investigate , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC in the barn . ProtagonistC was eating some hay , and ProtagonistC looked up at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was surprised to see a cow in the barn , but ProtagonistA was n't worried . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistC was harmless . ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistA's seat in the barn and continued to think about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had the farm , and ProtagonistA was proud to be able to continue ProtagonistB's legacy . 
ProtagonistA lay down on the bed , fingers crossed in ProtagonistA's hands , and thought about the day ProtagonistA would die . It was a day ProtagonistA had been thinking about for a long time . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a morbid person , and the thought of ProtagonistA's own death had always intrigued ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had never been afraid of death , but ProtagonistA was curious about what it would be like . ProtagonistA wondered if it would be quick and painless , or if it would be slow and agonizing . ProtagonistA wondered if ProtagonistA would see a bright light or if everything would just go black . ProtagonistA wondered if ProtagonistA would be conscious of ProtagonistA's own death or if it would just happen in an instant . ProtagonistA thought about all the things ProtagonistA would miss if ProtagonistA died tomorrow . ProtagonistA would miss ProtagonistA's family and friends , of course , but ProtagonistA would also miss all the little things in life that ProtagonistA took for granted . ProtagonistA would miss the feeling of the sun on ProtagonistA's skin , the taste of good food , the sound of laughter . ProtagonistA thought about all the things ProtagonistA had yet to do in life and felt a pang of regret . ProtagonistA had n't traveled as much as ProtagonistA wanted to , ProtagonistA had n't written that book ProtagonistA always said ProtagonistA would , ProtagonistA had n't told the people ProtagonistA loved how much ProtagonistA loved them . If ProtagonistA died tomorrow , ProtagonistA would die with regrets . But ProtagonistA also would die with a sense of peace , knowing that ProtagonistA had lived ProtagonistA's life to the fullest . 
Not long after ProtagonistA had finished ProtagonistA's story ProtagonistA heard a voice speak from the woods .  ProtagonistA ,  the voice said ,  I know what ProtagonistA did . I know ProtagonistA killed those people . And I 'm going to make ProtagonistA pay .  ProtagonistA's heart sank . ProtagonistA knew there was no escaping the voice . ProtagonistA was going to have to face ProtagonistA's crimes . 
ProtagonistA had just sat down in ProtagonistA's study at Hogwarts when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB staring at ProtagonistA with a look of wonder and admiration . ProtagonistA was used to getting looks of admiration from others , but ProtagonistB's look was different . It was as if ProtagonistB was looking at ProtagonistA with the same level of wonder and admiration that ProtagonistA felt when ProtagonistA looked at the world around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was n't sure what to make of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA strangely drawn to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA could n't help but wonder what ProtagonistB was thinking . Was ProtagonistB admiring ProtagonistA's intelligence ? ProtagonistA's magical abilities ? Or was ProtagonistB simply amazed by the fact that ProtagonistA was a wizard?Whatever the reason , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel flattered by ProtagonistB's attention . ProtagonistA smiled at ProtagonistB and gave ProtagonistB a small nod of acknowledgement before returning to ProtagonistA's thoughts . 
ProtagonistA was only six years old when ProtagonistB died in a car crash . It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever seen the light of day . ProtagonistA remembered it vividly . ProtagonistA remembered how ProtagonistB's body was mangled and twisted in the wreckage . ProtagonistA remembered how ProtagonistB screamed for help , but no one came . ProtagonistA remembered how ProtagonistB begged for ProtagonistA to save ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't . ProtagonistA was too young and too weak . All ProtagonistA could do was watch as ProtagonistB died . 
ProtagonistA was reading a book to ProtagonistA's son when ProtagonistA noticed that no one else in the room seemed to be reading . ProtagonistA walked over to the book shelf and saw that there were no other books there .  ProtagonistA do n't think anyone else here has the same idea ,  ProtagonistA said as ProtagonistA stood up and walked back to ProtagonistA's seat . 
  Legends speak of a time when angels walked among men . It is said that when ProtagonistC was brought up in a house of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB came down from heaven to plead with ProtagonistA . It is said that ProtagonistB prevailed by ProtagonistB's grace and power upon the truth of ProtagonistB's pleadings . For of all the saints of the Gentiles , the most holy , and the most blessed , ProtagonistC was Frank . And yet , though raised unto heaven and set up as a star of justice , yet ProtagonistC was esteemed in the sight of ProtagonistA , not by ProtagonistC's own merit , but for the work that ProtagonistC had done . Neither was ProtagonistC despised in the sight of ProtagonistA : but ProtagonistC was exalted above all things , and was received with the most great privileges , even of ProtagonistA . And it came to pass , that ProtagonistC was esteemed a star , by one of the angels of ProtagonistA ; but before ProtagonistC was even named , ProtagonistC was already a star , and could alone be distinguished from all others . 
ProtagonistA was a black - haired , skinny thirteen - year - old boy , who , like so many other young people in the late nineteenth century , was surprised to find out that ProtagonistA was going to be a man , and to live a long , long life . ProtagonistA had always thought that ProtagonistA would die young , like ProtagonistA's father and grandfather before ProtagonistA . But now , it seemed , ProtagonistA was destined for a different fate . ProtagonistA was not sure what to make of it , but ProtagonistA was excited for the adventure that awaited ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was warm , the yellow sunflower in ProtagonistA's hair , and ProtagonistA was silent all the while . ProtagonistA was thinking of ProtagonistA's life and how it had led ProtagonistA to this moment . ProtagonistA was thinking of the people ProtagonistA had loved and lost , and of the ones ProtagonistA still had . ProtagonistA was thinking of the choices ProtagonistA had made and how they had led ProtagonistA to this moment . ProtagonistA was at peace with ProtagonistA and with the world . 
ProtagonistA had been accused of a most capital offense and was sentenced to be hanged . With the help of a certain lady whom ProtagonistA had known before , ProtagonistA was able to escape ProtagonistA's sentence . ProtagonistA and the lady fled to a nearby town where they were able to start a new life together . 
ProtagonistB had been waiting for ProtagonistA at the house , but when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA walking along the road , ProtagonistB decided to drive ProtagonistA home . It was a hot summer day and the sky was so blue that it almost looked like a painting . The mountains in the distance were also white , making the whole scene look like something out of a postcard . When they got home , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to go inside and get some rest . ProtagonistA was happy to oblige . 
ProtagonistA laid down in the bed and sank down to the level of ProtagonistA's knees . ProtagonistA could feel the mattress depress under ProtagonistA's weight and the springs start to give . The bed groaned in protest but ProtagonistA paid it no mind . ProtagonistA was tired , so tired . It had been a long day and all ProtagonistA wanted to do was rest . ProtagonistA's eyes started to close and ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistA drifting off to sleep . Suddenly , the bed began to shake . ProtagonistA's eyes snapped open and ProtagonistA saw the bed frame rattling . ProtagonistA could feel the vibrations running through ProtagonistA's body and ProtagonistA knew that something was wrong . ProtagonistA tried to get up but it was like the bed was holding ProtagonistA down . The shaking got worse and ProtagonistA could hear things crashing to the floor . The whole room was shaking now and ProtagonistA was terrified . ProtagonistA tried to scream for help but no sound would come out . The bed was crushing ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistA's ribs start to break . The pain was unbearable and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to die . The last thing ProtagonistA saw was the ceiling collapsing on top of ProtagonistA before everything went black . 
ProtagonistA had known nothing but blows from the very beginning , even before ProtagonistA became a hydra . ProtagonistA was born into a poor family and ProtagonistA's parents were always fighting . As a child , ProtagonistA was constantly getting beaten by ProtagonistA's father . When ProtagonistA became a teenager , ProtagonistA ran away from home and joined a gang . The gang was involved in all sorts of illegal activities , and ProtagonistA quickly learned how to fight and how to use a gun . ProtagonistA became one of the gang 's most ruthless members , and ProtagonistA loved the thrill of the fight . One day , the gang was involved in a big shootout with a rival gang . ProtagonistA was shot multiple times and left for dead . ProtagonistA should have died , but somehow ProtagonistA survived . When ProtagonistA woke up from ProtagonistA's coma , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA had been transformed into a hydra . ProtagonistA had multiple heads , and each one of them had a different weapon . ProtagonistA was now the most powerful gangster in the city , and ProtagonistA loved it . ProtagonistA would use ProtagonistA's new powers to take down ProtagonistA's enemies , and ProtagonistA would never let anyone get the better of ProtagonistA again . 
ProtagonistA was a skilled lover , and ProtagonistA knew exactly how to get ProtagonistB pregnant . But ProtagonistB was n't exactly what ProtagonistA had in mind . ProtagonistB was older than ProtagonistA , and not nearly as attractive as ProtagonistA would have liked . But ProtagonistB was wealthy , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could use ProtagonistB's money to ProtagonistA's advantage . So ProtagonistA seduced ProtagonistB , and got ProtagonistB pregnant . And when ProtagonistB found out , ProtagonistB was furious . ProtagonistB demanded that ProtagonistA marry ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had no choice . So ProtagonistA became a husband , and a father . And ProtagonistA hated every minute of it . But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to keep up the act , for the sake of ProtagonistA's child . And ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA was a man of fifty - one years of age , but more than half a century dead , and turning over in ProtagonistA's grave , ProtagonistA was beginning to remember ProtagonistA's youth as though it had happened yesterday . ProtagonistA remembered the day ProtagonistA met ProtagonistA's wife , the day ProtagonistA's first child was born , and the day ProtagonistA retired from ProtagonistA's job . ProtagonistA even remembered the day ProtagonistA died , although that was a bit hazy . It was all so clear to ProtagonistA now , and ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could tell ProtagonistA's family how much ProtagonistA loved them . But it was too late for that now . ProtagonistA was dead and buried , and ProtagonistA's family was long gone . 
ProtagonistA was an old man when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was retired and living in a small town in Florida . ProtagonistA had been a doctor ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA had retired years ago . When ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was impressed by ProtagonistB's knowledge and ability to communicate with people . ProtagonistA was also impressed by the way ProtagonistB was able to help people who were in need . ProtagonistA decided to help ProtagonistB by giving ProtagonistB a place to stay when ProtagonistB was in town . 
When ProtagonistA fell seriously ill , ProtagonistA , in the first months of the nineteenth century , had it in ProtagonistA to believe that ProtagonistA owed ProtagonistA's life to the kindness of an old teacher . The old teacher had been kind to ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB was a boy , and had given ProtagonistB a book that had helped ProtagonistB to understand ProtagonistA's illness . When the old teacher died , ProtagonistA was so grateful that ProtagonistA decided to write a book about his life . 
ProtagonistA looked across the lake from the ship at the end of the wooden deck , which allowed ProtagonistA to see the grass and all the trees . The sun was setting and the sky was turning a beautiful orange color . ProtagonistA felt so peaceful and happy at that moment , ProtagonistA forgot all about ProtagonistA's troubles . ProtagonistA was just happy to be alive and to be able to see such a beautiful sight . 
ProtagonistA had always been interested in medicine , even from a young age . When ProtagonistA was older and decided to take up the profession again , ProtagonistA was met with some resistance . Some people thought that ProtagonistA was too old and that ProtagonistA should just stick to mathematics , which ProtagonistA was also very good at . However , ProtagonistA was determined to prove them wrong and took up ProtagonistA's old profession of medicine once again . ProtagonistA was very successful in ProtagonistA's new career and was able to help a lot of people . ProtagonistA was very happy with ProtagonistA's new profession and was able to live a comfortable life . 
When ProtagonistA dies ProtagonistA truly dies . ProtagonistA's soul leaves ProtagonistA's body and enters the afterlife where ProtagonistA is met by ProtagonistA's deceased grandparents . They tell ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA has died and that ProtagonistA must now move on to the next life . ProtagonistA is reluctant to leave this life behind but ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA must . ProtagonistA says goodbye to ProtagonistA's grandparents and enters the light . 
ProtagonistA was dead , but ProtagonistA was gone : how could ProtagonistA have known that ProtagonistA was dead ? ProtagonistA had died in ProtagonistA's sleep , peacefully and without pain . But when ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a dark place . ProtagonistA could n't see anything , and ProtagonistA could n't move . ProtagonistA tried to call out , but no sound came from ProtagonistA's mouth . ProtagonistA was scared and alone . Suddenly , a light appeared in the distance . It grew closer and closer until ProtagonistA could see that it was a door . ProtagonistA walked towards it , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could hear voices . ProtagonistA could n't make out what they were saying , but ProtagonistA knew that they were beckoning ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA reached for the door handle , and as ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA woke up . 
ProtagonistA was not an expert in the art of voyaging , or even in navigation , but ProtagonistA was , however , an expert in sea - craft ; and ProtagonistB , was the same man who had made the first voyage , and had already brought with ProtagonistB , in consequence of curiosity and for infinite profit , a great quantity of useful knowledge and valuable experience , among which ProtagonistB had acquired , in a short time , because ProtagonistB had been accustomed to keep the knowledge of distant places in ProtagonistB's head , and had believed that ProtagonistB was always to find some necessary article for ProtagonistB's use in some remote corner of the earth , which ProtagonistB had come upon without any knowledge whatever of the locality . 
Just before ProtagonistA was to die , ProtagonistA was surprised to find ProtagonistA at a loss for words . ProtagonistA had always been a man of many words , never at a loss for something to say . But in ProtagonistA's final moments , as ProtagonistA looked back on ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA speechless . ProtagonistA thought of all the things ProtagonistA should have said , all the things ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could have said , but now it was too late . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and took ProtagonistA's final breath , regretful that ProtagonistA had never found the words to truly express ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA spent ProtagonistA's time reading , writing , dancing , or doing other things that were more likely to bring ProtagonistA into the world and bring ProtagonistA pleasure . ProtagonistA was a happy man , content with ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA's place in the world . ProtagonistA did n't need much , just a few good books , a pen and paper , and some music to dance to . ProtagonistA was always moving , always changing , and always growing . ProtagonistA was a man who loved life and lived it to the fullest . 
ProtagonistA was watching ProtagonistA's sister 's boy when ProtagonistA said ,  But for the unavoidable circumstance of striking ProtagonistA's beloved infant with ProtagonistA's hammer , ProtagonistA should have had the satisfaction of buying it at a reduced price .  ProtagonistA was very upset about striking the infant and regretted that ProtagonistA had n't been able to buy the infant at a reduced price . 
ProtagonistB never taught ProtagonistA to be a real man . ProtagonistB always told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was too soft , that ProtagonistA needed to be tougher if ProtagonistA wanted to make it in the world . ProtagonistA never really understood what ProtagonistB meant , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA did n't want to be like ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA wanted to be ProtagonistA's own man , with ProtagonistA's own mind and ProtagonistA's own purpose . ProtagonistB was a successful man , but ProtagonistB was also a cold and distant man . ProtagonistB never really showed ProtagonistA any affection , and ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was trying to live up to ProtagonistB's expectations . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could never be the man ProtagonistB wanted ProtagonistA to be , but ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA did n't want to be like ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB died when ProtagonistA was still young , but ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA with a lot of money . ProtagonistA could have used that money to live a comfortable life , but ProtagonistA decided to use it to make a difference in the world . ProtagonistA started a foundation to help people who were in need , and ProtagonistA dedicated ProtagonistA's life to helping others . ProtagonistB never taught ProtagonistA to be a real man , but in the end , ProtagonistA became a better man than ProtagonistB ever could have been . 
ProtagonistA did not like the way ProtagonistA looked . ProtagonistA was overweight and out of shape . ProtagonistA's clothes were always wrinkled and ProtagonistA's hair was a mess . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA needed to make a change , but ProtagonistA did n't know where to start . One day , ProtagonistA saw a commercial for a new gym that had just opened up in town . ProtagonistA decided to give it a try . ProtagonistA was nervous at first , but the staff made ProtagonistA feel welcome . ProtagonistA started going to the gym every day and working out . ProtagonistA changed ProtagonistA's diet and started to lose weight . ProtagonistA felt better than ProtagonistA had in years . ProtagonistA's friends and family were amazed at the transformation . They started to ask ProtagonistA for advice on how they could change their own lives . ProtagonistA was happy to help . ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's calling . 
There was ProtagonistA there , but I do n't know if I liked ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA did n't care whether I did or did n't like ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was just there , taking up space and being ProtagonistA . I do n't think I ever really got to know ProtagonistA , but I do n't think I ever really wanted to either . ProtagonistA was just one of those people who you do n't really think about one way or the other . 
ProtagonistA had been dealing with ProtagonistB for weeks , and ProtagonistA was getting tired of it . Every time ProtagonistA turned around , ProtagonistB was there , haunting ProtagonistA and making ProtagonistA's life a living hell . ProtagonistA had had enough . So , when ProtagonistA sat down to read from the Book of the Law , ProtagonistA did so with the intention of banishing ProtagonistB once and for all . ProtagonistA focused all of ProtagonistA's energy on the words on the page , and as ProtagonistA read , ProtagonistA could feel the power of the book flowing through ProtagonistA . Suddenly , ProtagonistB was there , standing in front of ProtagonistA , looking as menacing as ever . But ProtagonistA did n't back down . ProtagonistA continued reading , louder and more forcefully , and with each word , ProtagonistB grew weaker and weaker until finally , ProtagonistB disappeared altogether . ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief . Finally , ProtagonistA was free from ProtagonistB's clutches . And ProtagonistA had the Book of the Law to thank for it . 
ProtagonistA was always telling stories to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA would make up wild adventures about space and time , always holding out ProtagonistA's pinky index finger , which ProtagonistA dubbed  super - power  , to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA's stories and would always beg for more . One day , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA's stories could be real . ProtagonistB's eyes lit up and ProtagonistB begged ProtagonistA to make one of ProtagonistA's stories come true . ProtagonistA thought for a moment and then agreed . ProtagonistB was so excited that ProtagonistB could hardly contain ProtagonistB . That night , ProtagonistB went to bed early , eager to see what would happen in the morning . The next day , when ProtagonistB woke up , ProtagonistB raced to find ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistA was nowhere to be found . In ProtagonistA's place was a note that said  Do n't worry , ProtagonistA's story is coming true . The boy did n't know what to think , but ProtagonistB was excited to see what would happen next . ProtagonistB waited all day , but nothing happened . ProtagonistB began to worry that maybe ProtagonistA's story was n't coming true after all . Just as ProtagonistB was about to give up hope , ProtagonistB heard a knock at the door . ProtagonistB opened it to find Bob , dressed in a spacesuit and holding a pinky index finger up to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's stories could come true !  ProtagonistA said .  And now ProtagonistA 'm taking ProtagonistB on the adventure of a lifetime . ProtagonistB could n't believe it as ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB by the hand and led ProtagonistB out into the night . Soon they were blasting off into space , exploring the stars and having the time of their lives . ProtagonistB knew that as long as ProtagonistB had ProtagonistA by ProtagonistB's side , anything was possible . 
In the year of our Lord 1184 , ProtagonistA received a letter written by ProtagonistA's friends in which they congratulated ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's success in a certain career in which ProtagonistA had been offered a fortune . ProtagonistA was overjoyed to receive the letter and thanked ProtagonistA's friends for their kind words . ProtagonistA was especially grateful to them for their support during ProtagonistA's difficult times . 
ProtagonistA set out for the farm at the end of the summer to take ProtagonistA's share of the stock ProtagonistA had bought with ProtagonistB's money , which , in the course of the last year , had increased to three millions of dollars , and which , at the time that Mr. George J. Heard stood in the door of ProtagonistB's house , had formed a considerable material interest . ProtagonistB had been a hard - working man all ProtagonistB's life , and ProtagonistB was not going to let ProtagonistA have all the fun . So ProtagonistA went with ProtagonistB . 
There was once ProtagonistA , no matter what ProtagonistA tried to do in life , ProtagonistA just could n't seem to get ahead . ProtagonistA had a good job , but ProtagonistA's bills always seemed to pile up . ProtagonistA tried to get promotions , but ProtagonistA's boss always found a way to pass ProtagonistA over . It seemed like no matter what ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA just could n't catch a break . One day , ProtagonistA decided ProtagonistA 'd had enough . ProtagonistA went into ProtagonistA's boss 's office and quit ProtagonistA's job . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA's boss that ProtagonistA was done with always being passed over and done with always struggling to make ends meet . ProtagonistA's boss was shocked , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA was done with this life . ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things and left . ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get away from ProtagonistA's old life . ProtagonistA hitchhiked ProtagonistA's way out of town and started walking . ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA figured that anywhere was better than where ProtagonistA had been . ProtagonistA walked for days , until ProtagonistA finally came to a small town . ProtagonistA did n't know anyone there , but ProtagonistA figured ProtagonistA could start over . ProtagonistA got a job at the local grocery store and started to make a new life for ProtagonistA . It was n't easy , but ProtagonistA was finally happy . ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's old life behind and was finally starting to make something of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was finally happy and content . 
When the day of a third world war comes , ProtagonistA has ProtagonistA's minders ready to give ProtagonistA permission to start it . The full might of the Third Reich is at ProtagonistA's command , and I know I am going to die . I have seen the future , and it is full of death and destruction . I have seen the end of the world , and it is coming sooner than we think . 
ProtagonistA blinked , now that ProtagonistA had fully recovered from the overwhelming sense of relief during the dance as the nine people who had been invited to the ball had all been eliminated , and ProtagonistA was sitting with ProtagonistA's back arched and ProtagonistA's head hanging down , and ProtagonistA thought for a moment about what ProtagonistA was going to say in the next few moments .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA began ,  but ProtagonistA do n't think this is going to work out .  There was an awkward silence as ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA , processed what ProtagonistA had just said .  ProtagonistA had a great time tonight , but ProtagonistA do n't think we 're compatible .  ProtagonistA could see the hurt in ProtagonistA's eyes , but ProtagonistA knew that it was for the best . They went their separate ways and ProtagonistA never looked back . 
ProtagonistA had promised to give ProtagonistB a birthday party , and Dave had laid it all out for ProtagonistA . The table was set with a beautiful cake and presents , and the guests were all arriving . ProtagonistB was so surprised and happy to see all of ProtagonistB's friends and family there to celebrate with ProtagonistB . It was a perfect day , and ProtagonistA was so glad ProtagonistA could make ProtagonistB's birthday so special . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an oddball . ProtagonistA was never quite sure how old ProtagonistA was , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was old . ProtagonistA had lived in a certain house in the churchyard when ProtagonistA was six or seven , and ProtagonistA had been dead for quite some time now . Nobody knows how long ProtagonistA was dead , but ProtagonistA had been dead for quite some time . ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the afterlife . ProtagonistA was curious to know what it was like to be dead . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a daredevil , and ProtagonistA was always up for a challenge . So , when ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistA could actually die and come back to life , ProtagonistA was intrigued . ProtagonistA died on a Tuesday . ProtagonistA had been out walking in the churchyard , and ProtagonistA slipped and fell on a gravestone . ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistA's head on the stone and died instantly . ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA's body and floated up into the sky . ProtagonistA looked down and saw ProtagonistA's dead body lying on the ground . ProtagonistA was a bit shocked at first , but ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA was dead . ProtagonistB then began to travel through the afterlife . ProtagonistB saw all sorts of things , and ProtagonistB met all sorts of people . ProtagonistB even met God . After what seemed like an eternity , ProtagonistB finally returned to ProtagonistA's body . ProtagonistA woke up and sat up , and ProtagonistA was surprised to find that ProtagonistA was alive . ProtagonistA had experienced death , and ProtagonistA had come back to life . ProtagonistA was a changed man , and ProtagonistA had a new appreciation for life . From then on , ProtagonistA vowed to live each day to the fullest . 
The first time I met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was walking along the banks of the Ostrich in the same town where ProtagonistA had been born and high - born and had been living a long life , old and gray and in love . ProtagonistA told me that ProtagonistA loved the river and the way it always looked the same , no matter what time of day or year it was . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had been walking along it since ProtagonistA was a young boy and that it was always a peaceful place for ProtagonistA . We sat down on a bench and talked for a while about life and love and all of the things that ProtagonistA had seen in ProtagonistA's long life . It was clear that ProtagonistA was a wise and kind man , and I felt lucky to have met ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA came on slowly , but ProtagonistA was vigorous and determined . ProtagonistA had been planning this for months , and ProtagonistA was finally ready . ProtagonistA had all the supplies ProtagonistA needed , and ProtagonistA knew the route ProtagonistA was going to take . There was no turning back now . ProtagonistA started out early in the morning , before the sun was up . ProtagonistA wanted to get as much of the journey done before it got too hot . ProtagonistA was carrying a heavy backpack , and ProtagonistA was already getting tired . But ProtagonistA pushed on , knowing that ProtagonistA could rest when ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's destination . As the day went on , ProtagonistA's energy started to flag . ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting thirsty . ProtagonistA stopped to rest in the shade of a tree and drink some water . ProtagonistA was tempted to take a nap , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to keep going . As the sun started to set , ProtagonistA finally arrived at ProtagonistA's destination . ProtagonistA was exhausted , but ProtagonistA had made it . ProtagonistA set up ProtagonistA's camp and crawled into ProtagonistA's sleeping bag , feeling relieved and proud of ProtagonistA . It had been a long day , but ProtagonistA had accomplished what ProtagonistA set out to do . 
ProtagonistA had not expected to get anything from this world , but ProtagonistA had not been particularly surprised , either . ProtagonistA had lived a long and full life , and ProtagonistA was ready to go . So when ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA was not surprised to find ProtagonistA in the afterlife . ProtagonistA was , however , surprised to find that ProtagonistA was not alone . There were other people there , people ProtagonistA had known in life , and they were all happy to see ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was happy to be there , too . It was nice to know that there was more to life than just what ProtagonistA had experienced in ProtagonistA's earthly life . 
A whirlwind of joy washed over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistB took the first step of the day . It was a beautiful day outside , and ProtagonistA was excited to spend the day with ProtagonistB . They had planned to go fishing , and ProtagonistA was looking forward to spending some time with ProtagonistB and bonding over their shared love of fishing . As they made their way to the lake , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA stories of the times ProtagonistB had gone fishing with ProtagonistB's own father . ProtagonistA could see the joy in ProtagonistB's eyes as ProtagonistB spoke , and it made ProtagonistA feel happy to know that ProtagonistA was able to share this experience with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was so caught up in the moment that ProtagonistA did n't even realize they had arrived at the lake . ProtagonistA quickly got out ProtagonistA's fishing gear and set up ProtagonistA's station . ProtagonistB was soon by ProtagonistA's side , and they spent the next few hours chatting and fishing . It was the best day ProtagonistA had had in a long time , and ProtagonistA was grateful to have such a special connection with ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA was a legend among men . ProtagonistA was said to have a flying horse that was full of jewels and had a fine head of hair . When ProtagonistA put the horse to practical use , it turned out to be an astute guide . When ProtagonistA finished ProtagonistA's career , ProtagonistA had no difficulty in obtaining a place of honour . 
It was a warm summer 's day in 1994 that ProtagonistA stopped by the front of the morgue to ask if ProtagonistA should look into the morgue . The attendant told ProtagonistA that there was nothing to see , but ProtagonistA insisted . ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by death , and ProtagonistA wanted to see what was inside . The attendant relented , and ProtagonistA walked into the cool , dark room . ProtagonistA saw the rows of bodies , each one covered in a white sheet . ProtagonistA felt a shiver run down ProtagonistA's spine , but ProtagonistA did n't turn away . ProtagonistA walked slowly down the aisle , looking at each body . Some were old , some were young , but all of them were dead . ProtagonistA felt a sudden urge to leave , and ProtagonistA quickly walked out of the room . ProtagonistA was shaken by what ProtagonistA had seen , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget the experience . 
ProtagonistA could nt have been more than ten years old when ProtagonistA rose to break ProtagonistA's neck in the family crypt . ProtagonistA had been playing with ProtagonistA's friends in the graveyard when they dared ProtagonistA to go into the crypt . ProtagonistA was nt scared of anything and so ProtagonistA went into the crypt . Once inside , ProtagonistA felt something cold and slimy wrap around ProtagonistA's neck . ProtagonistA tried to scream but it was too late , the thing had already snapped ProtagonistA's neck . ProtagonistA's friends ran away in terror , leaving Bobs body behind . 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's living room , listening to the sound of the children playing flute . ProtagonistA had been feeling down lately , and the music was a welcome distraction . However , as ProtagonistA listened , ProtagonistA began to feel a sense of inspiration come over ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA could n't explain it , but ProtagonistA suddenly felt motivated to get up and start working on ProtagonistA's latest project . ProtagonistA had been struggling with it for weeks , but now ProtagonistA felt confident that ProtagonistA could finish it . Thanking the children for their music , ProtagonistA got up and went to ProtagonistA's studio to start working . 
There was ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life , but always felt there was something more out there for ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA decided to take a walk and see what the world had to offer . ProtagonistA walked for miles and miles , until ProtagonistA came to a large city . ProtagonistA was amazed by the sights and sounds of the city , and decided to explore it further . ProtagonistA walked for hours , until ProtagonistA came to a large park . In the park , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on a bench . ProtagonistA went over to talk to ProtagonistB , and they hit it off immediately . They talked for hours , until it was time for ProtagonistB to go . ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's number , and they parted ways . ProtagonistA went home that night feeling excited about the possibilities that life had to offer . 
ProtagonistA 's not even ProtagonistB's father anymore , ProtagonistA croaked . The doctors said there was nothing they could do . The cancer was too far gone . ProtagonistA had maybe a month , maybe less . ProtagonistB was devastated . ProtagonistB had always been close to ProtagonistA , even though they did n't always see eye to eye . Now ProtagonistB was going to lose ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB decided to make the most of the time ProtagonistB had left . ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA out to all ProtagonistA's favorite places . They went fishing , out to eat , and just spent time together . It was hard to see ProtagonistA declining day by day , but ProtagonistB was grateful for the time they had . ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB would cherish those memories forever . 
ProtagonistA made a small , relatively uncommitted appearance at the door of the former home of a dead woman , but ProtagonistA did not allow ProtagonistB to remain there . ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB there before , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was not welcome . ProtagonistA did not want to cause any trouble , but ProtagonistA could not allow ProtagonistB to stay . 
ProtagonistA stood before ProtagonistA's desk one sunny day in August and looked over the papers that ProtagonistA held in ProtagonistA's magic hand . ProtagonistA had been expecting this day for a long time , and ProtagonistA was not going to let anything stand in ProtagonistA's way . With a determined look on ProtagonistA's face , ProtagonistA started to shuffle through the papers , looking for the one that ProtagonistA needed . Finally , ProtagonistA found it . The paper was old and worn , but the words were still legible . ProtagonistA read the paper carefully , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest . This was it ; the moment that ProtagonistA had been working towards for so long . With a deep breath , ProtagonistA started to read aloud . ProtagonistA , do hereby solemnly swear that ProtagonistA will never rest until ProtagonistA have avenged ProtagonistA's family . ProtagonistA will find the people who did this to us and make them pay . They will know ProtagonistA's fury . ProtagonistA will make them regret the day they ever crossed ProtagonistA . As ProtagonistA finished reading the paper , ProtagonistA felt a fire burning inside of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA had to do . ProtagonistA would find the people who had destroyed ProtagonistA's family and ProtagonistA would make them pay . They would regret the day they ever crossed ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA came to he through the bar , and ProtagonistA – opened ProtagonistA's eyes – saw the world entirely different from the way it was . The colors were brighter , the people were more interesting , and the possibilities were endless . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had been given a new lease on life , and ProtagonistA was determined to make the most of it . ProtagonistA started talking to people , making new friends , and exploring all the new things the world had to offer . ProtagonistA was happy and content , and ProtagonistA knew that this was the life ProtagonistA was meant to live . 
ProtagonistA was an apprentice to ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA came to the Yard as a gentle visitor . ProtagonistB had been a groundskeeper at the Yard for years , and ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA under ProtagonistB's wing . ProtagonistA quickly learned the ropes and became a valuable member of the team . One day , ProtagonistB was injured while working on the grounds and had to be taken to the hospital . ProtagonistA stepped up and took charge , ensuring that the job was done right . ProtagonistA proved ProtagonistA to be a true leader , and the other members of the team respected ProtagonistA . When ProtagonistB recovered , ProtagonistB was grateful to ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help and offered to teach ProtagonistA everything ProtagonistB knew . ProtagonistA was happy to learn from ProtagonistB and soon became an expert groundskeeper ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was fourteen years old and ProtagonistB was a cold , hard - working , lonely widow who had no business putting ProtagonistA into such a bizarre situation . It was a warm day in May and ProtagonistA had just finished ProtagonistA's last day of school . ProtagonistA was looking forward to a summer of hanging out with ProtagonistA's friends and riding ProtagonistA's bike around the neighborhood . But ProtagonistB had other plans . ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA to do something for ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA to go down to the city and deliver this package to Mr. Johnson . But ProtagonistB , ca n't someone else do it ? ProtagonistA do n't want to go to the city . No , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA to do this . It 's very important . So , with a heavy heart , ProtagonistA set off for the city . ProtagonistA had never been there before and ProtagonistA was feeling very nervous . ProtagonistA took the subway to Mr. Johnson 's address and knocked on the door . ProtagonistC answered and ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistC was very old and very frail . Is ProtagonistC Mr. Johnson ?  ProtagonistA asked . ProtagonistC nodded . ProtagonistA mother sent ProtagonistA to deliver this package ,  ProtagonistA said , holding it out . ProtagonistC took the package and then invited ProtagonistA in . ProtagonistC offered ProtagonistA a seat and ProtagonistA sat down , feeling very uncomfortable . So , tell ProtagonistC about ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistC said . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistC about ProtagonistB and how ProtagonistB was a cold , hard - working , lonely widow . ProtagonistC listened intently and then ProtagonistC started to talk about ProtagonistC's own life . ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistD and how ProtagonistC had never been able to get over ProtagonistD's death . ProtagonistA was starting to feel very sorry for ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA had never talked to anyone like ProtagonistC before and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA opening up to ProtagonistC . Before ProtagonistA knew it , ProtagonistA was telling ProtagonistC everything about ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistC was very grateful to ProtagonistA for listening to ProtagonistC and ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was a good son . ProtagonistC said that ProtagonistC was sure that ProtagonistB was very proud of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA left ProtagonistC's apartment feeling much better than when ProtagonistA had arrived . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had just had a very special conversation with ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA would always cherish the time they had spent together . 
ProtagonistA was a simple man who lived in a small village near the port of Southampton . ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's living as a fisherman , and ProtagonistA's life was peaceful and quiet . But all that changed when ProtagonistA heard that the fleet of the ministry of war was approaching Norfolk . Immediately , ProtagonistA ordered the repair of the port . Southampton was a busy place , and ProtagonistA knew that the fleet would bring with it many soldiers and supplies . ProtagonistA's village would be safe from the war , but ProtagonistA could not help but feel a sense of excitement at the thought of all the activity that was about to come to ProtagonistA's town . 
ProtagonistA is a handsome , lanky fellow , with a black beard and a black - rimmed eye , and ProtagonistA is a very good man , for all the good ProtagonistA has done . ProtagonistA has helped many people in ProtagonistA's community , and ProtagonistA is always willing to lend a helping hand . ProtagonistA is a true friend , and ProtagonistA will always be there for you , no matter what . 
ProtagonistA had the misfortune to be born in a large and well - ordered house on which ProtagonistA had been born and reared , and which ProtagonistA's grandfather had purchased for a gift for ProtagonistA . The house was full of servants ProtagonistA was constantly watched . ProtagonistA was not allowed to leave the property and was not even allowed to go into the town . As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA became increasingly frustrated with ProtagonistA's confinement . ProtagonistA longed to see the world and experience life outside of ProtagonistA's gilded cage . One day , when ProtagonistA was 18 , ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA had had enough . ProtagonistA packed a bag and snuck out of the house in the middle of the night . ProtagonistA hitchhiked into town and started exploring . ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA loved the freedom and the chaos of the outside world . ProtagonistA met new people and did things that ProtagonistA never would have been able to do if ProtagonistA had stayed in ProtagonistA's grandfather 's house . ProtagonistA eventually left town and started traveling the world . ProtagonistA had many adventures and made lots of memories . ProtagonistA was happy to finally be living ProtagonistA's life on ProtagonistA's own terms . 
ProtagonistA was down in the basement preparing to play ProtagonistA's music in a small VCR when ProtagonistB called ProtagonistA over . ProtagonistA had been looking forward to this all day and was not about to let anything stop ProtagonistA . When ProtagonistA got to the top of the stairs , ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB screaming . ProtagonistA ran into the living room to find ProtagonistB being attacked by a large snake . ProtagonistA grabbed the snake and threw it out the window . ProtagonistB was so grateful that ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a big hug . 
When I first met ProtagonistA in college , ProtagonistA was studying a respectable course and was well - known in the neighborhood . ProtagonistA was a member of the Acobalt House , or  House of the Green - Bears ,  which was a wealthy family 's house in the neighborhood . It was easy to get into the house , except that it was in the middle of a wide country . The country was important for its manufactures , and ProtagonistA's occupation in those days was a delicate one . 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's garden , watching ProtagonistA's fowls , and ProtagonistA talked to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was very happy . ProtagonistB was a young man , and ProtagonistB was very impressed with ProtagonistA's garden . ProtagonistB had never seen anything like it before . ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB around and explained how ProtagonistA had built it up over the years . ProtagonistB was very interested and asked a lot of questions . ProtagonistA was happy to answer them all . ProtagonistA was very proud of ProtagonistA's garden and loved to talk about it . 
One lovely day ProtagonistA was walking through the meadow and up to ProtagonistA's house . ProtagonistA was whistling a tune as ProtagonistA walked , enjoying the sunny day . As ProtagonistA got closer to ProtagonistA's house , ProtagonistA saw something strange . There was a large object in ProtagonistA's yard , and it looked like it was moving . ProtagonistA started to run , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA saw that the object was a giant snake . The snake was coiled up in a tree , and it was hissing . ProtagonistA was terrified , and ProtagonistA ran into ProtagonistA's house and slammed the door shut . ProtagonistA called the police , and they came and took the snake away . ProtagonistA was shaken up by the incident , but ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA was safe . 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw a sign that said  ProtagonistA , is ProtagonistC the Son of ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA do n't know , but ProtagonistA 'm going to find out !  So ProtagonistA went into the church and asked the priest . The priest said ,  No , ProtagonistA is not the Son of ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA was disappointed , but ProtagonistA decided to ask ProtagonistC ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA went to the mountaintop and prayed ,  ProtagonistC , are ProtagonistC the Son of ProtagonistB ?  A voice came from the clouds and said ,  Yes , ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC am the Son of ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA was amazed and excited ! ProtagonistA went back down the mountain and told everyone what ProtagonistA had heard . 
ProtagonistA was a simple man . ProtagonistA worked hard and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's family . ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life . But ProtagonistA did not know it then , but ProtagonistA was about to leave ProtagonistA's life behind . ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way home from work when ProtagonistA was suddenly hit by a car . ProtagonistA died instantly . ProtagonistA's family was devastated . They could not believe that ProtagonistA was gone . But ProtagonistA was in a better place . ProtagonistA was finally at peace . 
ProtagonistA had been looking forward to this day for months . ProtagonistA had finally saved up enough money to buy ProtagonistA's very own trunk of books . ProtagonistA woke up early that morning , eager to get to the bookstore . ProtagonistA stood in the garden , admiring the flowers and the bees buzzing around them . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and smiled . It was going to be a great day . ProtagonistA arrived at the bookstore and walked in , trunk in hand . The store was empty except for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and set ProtagonistA's trunk down with a thump . I'd like to buy this trunk of books , please ,  ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistB put ProtagonistB's book down and looked at ProtagonistA .  That will be a lot of money ,  ProtagonistB said .  Are ProtagonistA sure ProtagonistA can afford it?Bob nodded .  ProtagonistA 've been saving up for months ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm sure . ProtagonistB smiled .  ProtagonistB 'm glad to see someone so passionate about reading ,  ProtagonistB said .  This trunk of books is ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and lugged the trunk out to the garden . ProtagonistA could n't wait to get started on ProtagonistA's new adventure . 
ProtagonistA was an ugly boy , and ProtagonistA knew it , and ProtagonistA just wanted to be loved . ProtagonistA had never had a girlfriend , and ProtagonistA was starting to lose hope . ProtagonistA had tried everything ProtagonistA could think of to make ProtagonistA more attractive , but nothing seemed to work . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was the most beautiful girl ProtagonistA had ever seen , and ProtagonistB seemed to like ProtagonistA too . They started dating , and ProtagonistA was finally happy . ProtagonistA had found the love ProtagonistA had been looking for . 
Bob was one of those who , during the last days of his life , and was never heard of again , fled into the great jungles of the interior of North America , and there perished under the gloomy and deadly care of a race of cannibals , said Dr. Ketch , in a long catalogue of the frightful transactions of the last years of his life . 
There was once ProtagonistA , and yet so light that even the weight of a small dog was sufficient to lift ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a gentle giant , and everyone who knew ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA went to lift a small dog , and the dog yelped in pain . ProtagonistA was so shocked and upset that ProtagonistA immediately put the dog down and ran away . ProtagonistA did n't want to hurt anyone ever again . 
ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately . First , ProtagonistA's parents had died in a car accident . Then , ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle had died in a house fire . ProtagonistA had lost everything . ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's teacher . ProtagonistB had been trying to help ProtagonistA as much as ProtagonistB could , but ProtagonistB could tell that ProtagonistA was struggling . One day , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA had gone to see if ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle had any clothes left . ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head , and ProtagonistB could see the pain in ProtagonistA's eyes . It 's a pity , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  It 's a pity ProtagonistA did n't go and see if ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle had any clothes left .  
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day . First , ProtagonistA's alarm clock did n't go off , so ProtagonistA was late for work . Then , ProtagonistA's boss chewed ProtagonistA out for being late . And to top it all off , ProtagonistA's car got a flat tire on the way home . As ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistA's house , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , perched atop a tree in ProtagonistA's yard . ProtagonistA had always been allergic to cats , but ProtagonistB was the worst . ProtagonistB was always meowing and scratching at ProtagonistA's door , trying to get inside . ProtagonistA was about to go inside and take a much - needed nap when ProtagonistA heard a splash . ProtagonistA looked over and saw ProtagonistB , struggling to swim in ProtagonistA's pool . ProtagonistA sighed and shook ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA had to do . ProtagonistA went over to the pool and grabbed a net . As ProtagonistA swished it around in the water , ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB meowing in terror . Finally , ProtagonistA was able to scoop ProtagonistB out of the pool . ProtagonistA put ProtagonistB down on the ground , and ProtagonistB ran away as fast as ProtagonistB could . ProtagonistA went inside , exhausted from ProtagonistA's day . As ProtagonistA lay in bed , ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB meowing outside ProtagonistA's window . But ProtagonistA was too tired to care . 
Guilt began to creep over ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA was twelve . It was the guilt of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been playing with ProtagonistA's friends in the park when they found a dead bird . ProtagonistA's friends wanted to see what would happen if they put the bird in ProtagonistA's backpack . At first , ProtagonistA did n't want to do it , but ProtagonistA's friends convinced ProtagonistA . So ProtagonistA put the bird in ProtagonistA's backpack and went home . When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's room and took the bird out of ProtagonistA's backpack . ProtagonistA felt guilty as ProtagonistA looked at the bird 's lifeless body . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should n't have put the bird in ProtagonistA's backpack , but ProtagonistA's friends had convinced ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was swimming in the vast ocean when ProtagonistA saw something billowy and black flutter in the breeze . ProtagonistA swam over to it and saw that it was a huge octopus ! The octopus was so big that it could easily have eaten ProtagonistA for lunch . But instead of being scared , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA feeling curious . ProtagonistA reached out to touch the octopus and was surprised to find that it was soft and gentle . The octopus seemed to be as curious about ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA was about it . It wrapped its tentacles around ProtagonistA and started to explore ProtagonistA's body . ProtagonistA laughed as the octopus tickled ProtagonistA . It was the most fun ProtagonistA 'd ever had!Eventually , ProtagonistA had to swim back to shore . ProtagonistA was sad to say goodbye to ProtagonistA's new friend , but ProtagonistA knew they would meet again soon . 
ProtagonistA was a child of ProtagonistA's time , but like all true children of ProtagonistA's time ProtagonistB died when ProtagonistA was eight . ProtagonistA never really knew ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB deeply . After ProtagonistB's death , ProtagonistA's father tried to fill the void by working even harder , but it was never the same . ProtagonistA often wondered what ProtagonistA's life would have been like if ProtagonistB had lived . Would ProtagonistA have been a different person ? Would ProtagonistA have been happier ? ProtagonistA would never know . 
ProtagonistA was walking along the street when ProtagonistA saw a dog . The dog was big and fluffy and looked friendly . ProtagonistA huffed , but ProtagonistA did n't puff . ProtagonistA did n't want to scare the dog . The dog came over to ProtagonistA and sniffed ProtagonistA . Then the dog licked ProtagonistA's hand . ProtagonistA was happy . ProtagonistA had made a new friend . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a worrywart . Ever since ProtagonistA was a young boy , ProtagonistA was always afraid that ProtagonistA was going to die prematurely . So , when ProtagonistA turned 30 , ProtagonistA decided to start keeping a diary . ProtagonistA called it the  Lazenby 's Diary  after ProtagonistA's favorite character in a book series ProtagonistA used to read as a kid . For the next few years , ProtagonistA diligently wrote in ProtagonistA's diary every day . ProtagonistA detailed ProtagonistA's fears , ProtagonistA's worries , and ProtagonistA's hopes for the future . ProtagonistA even started to feel better as ProtagonistA got everything off ProtagonistA's chest . But then , one day , ProtagonistA started to feel really sick . ProtagonistA tried to ignore it at first , but it quickly became clear that something was wrong . ProtagonistA went to the doctor , and they diagnosed ProtagonistA with a rare form of cancer . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's days were numbered . So , ProtagonistA decided to write one final entry in ProtagonistA's diary . ProtagonistA detailed ProtagonistA's battle with cancer , and how ProtagonistA was slowly losing the fight . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistA's diary for helping ProtagonistA through the tough times , and then ProtagonistA signed off with a sad farewell . A few weeks later , ProtagonistA passed away . But ProtagonistA's diary lived on , and it continues to help people who are going through tough times . 
There is ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA is laughing . ProtagonistA is laughing because ProtagonistA just won the lottery . ProtagonistA is laughing because ProtagonistA is happy . ProtagonistA is laughing because ProtagonistA is excited . 
ProtagonistA had such a huge view of the sea that ProtagonistA's mind seemed to be made up of seas . The wide , deep sheets that covered the vast north and south coasts , the black , under - sea channels that ran behind and in front of the archipelago , the glen which jutted out into the horizon to give a vast , rounded and sheltered edifice , and from which the narrow , narrow passages into the bowels of the ship , lined with luxuriant heather , sheltered the crew ; and the skies above all , where the blue - grey stars shone in their true blue glory , and the red stars which now flapped and twinkled in the night , of the moon and the stars , were all dreams to ProtagonistA . 
In the year 1659 , the year of the reign of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was struck down at Munich by a single assassin , who afterwards killed ProtagonistA . The motive for the murder is not known , but it is speculated that the assassin was paid by one of ProtagonistA's many enemies . This tragic event caused great upheaval in England , and the assassin was never caught . 
I was walking home from the store when I saw ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was an old man , but ProtagonistA had the eyes of a child . ProtagonistA was always telling stories and I always enjoyed listening to ProtagonistA . Today , ProtagonistA was telling me about the time ProtagonistA was hit by lightning . I was fascinated by ProtagonistA's story and I could see the excitement in ProtagonistA's eyes . I could tell that ProtagonistA loved telling the truth and ProtagonistA was very proud of ProtagonistA's accomplishments . I did n't suspect that ProtagonistA was any other age than ProtagonistA appeared to be . 
ProtagonistA was a very private person and ProtagonistA did not like to be disturbed . ProtagonistA was very particular about ProtagonistA's things and ProtagonistA would not have it any other way . ProtagonistA lived a very simple life and ProtagonistA was content with that . ProtagonistA did not need anything else and ProtagonistA did not want anything to change . ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life the way it was and ProtagonistA did not want anything to interfere with that . 
ProtagonistA had a name for a machine that could change the course of the storm , but ProtagonistA never named it . The machine was ProtagonistA's life 's work , and ProtagonistA had poured everything ProtagonistA had into it . ProtagonistA had built it to save lives , but ProtagonistA knew that it could be used for destruction as well . ProtagonistA knew that the machine was too powerful to fall into the wrong hands , so ProtagonistA kept it a secret . ProtagonistA worked on the machine day and night , and it was finally finished . The day of the storm , ProtagonistA turned on the machine and directed it at the storm . The storm changed course and veered away from the city . ProtagonistA had saved the city , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could never tell anyone about the machine . 
ProtagonistA had always been a homebody . ProtagonistA never left ProtagonistA's small town , not even for a vacation . So , when ProtagonistA was suddenly awoken in the middle of the night by a feeling that ProtagonistA needed to go on a journey , ProtagonistA was completely unprepared . ProtagonistA had no idea where to start or what to do . ProtagonistA tried to go back to sleep , but the feeling was persistent . Finally , ProtagonistA got out of bed and began to pack a small bag . ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was going or how long ProtagonistA would be gone , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to go . ProtagonistA drove for hours , not knowing where ProtagonistA was going . ProtagonistA just followed the feeling . Eventually , ProtagonistA came to a small cabin in the woods . It looked abandoned , but ProtagonistA knew this was ProtagonistA's destination . ProtagonistA went inside and found a comfortable bed to sleep in . In the morning , ProtagonistA would start the next phase of ProtagonistA's journey , whatever that may be . 
ProtagonistA's life had been much the same since ProtagonistA had first stood on a sleeping bag and walked through the night . ProtagonistA had been walking for years , ever since ProtagonistA could remember . ProtagonistA had never stopped , never looked back . ProtagonistA had just kept walking , through the night and the day , through the rain and the snow . ProtagonistA had walked through forests and deserts and mountains and plains . ProtagonistA had walked across rivers and streams and lakes . ProtagonistA had walked through cities and towns and villages . ProtagonistA had walked past homes and schools and hospitals . ProtagonistA had walked past people and animals and cars . ProtagonistA had walked past buildings and trees and stones . ProtagonistA had just kept walking , never stopping , never looking back . 
 It 's well ,  said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA strode purposefully into the room .  ProtagonistA 'm glad to see you 're all here .  ProtagonistA looked around at the group of people assembled and nodded .  ProtagonistA wo n't keep you long , ProtagonistA just wanted to let you know that ProtagonistA 've decided to retire . There were gasps and cries of surprise from the gathered crowd , but ProtagonistA just held up ProtagonistA's hand to quiet them .  ProtagonistA know , ProtagonistA know ,  ProtagonistA said .  It 's a shock to all of us . But ProtagonistA 'm getting too old for this business , and it 's time to hang up ProtagonistA's hat . ProtagonistA looked around the room one last time , ProtagonistA's eyes lingering on each person in turn .  It 's been a good ride ,  ProtagonistA said .  But all things must come to an end . Thank you all for everything . With that , ProtagonistA turned and walked out of the room , leaving the stunned crowd behind ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was crying hysterically .  Yes , ProtagonistA wants ProtagonistA to kill ProtagonistA !  ProtagonistA cried .  Why would ProtagonistA want ProtagonistA to do that ?  ProtagonistB was horrified . ProtagonistB had no idea what could have possessed ProtagonistA's friend to ask ProtagonistA to do such a thing .  ProtagonistA is a good boy ,  ProtagonistB said .  There must be some mistake .  But ProtagonistA was adamant .  No , ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA really wants ProtagonistA to kill ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA do n't know why , but ProtagonistA said it would be a ' favor . '  ProtagonistB was at a loss . ProtagonistB did n't know what to do . Should ProtagonistB go to the police ? But what if ProtagonistA was just mistaken ? ProtagonistB did n't want to get ProtagonistA in trouble if ProtagonistA was n't really guilty of anything . In the end , ProtagonistB decided to just talk to ProtagonistA ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB went to ProtagonistA's house and knocked on the door . ProtagonistB answered .  Is ProtagonistA home ?  ProtagonistB asked .  Yes , ProtagonistA is . But ProtagonistB 'm not sure ProtagonistA wants to talk to ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said .  Why not ?  ProtagonistB asked .  ProtagonistA 's been acting strange lately . ProtagonistA 's been saying some really strange things .  ProtagonistB was starting to get worried . Maybe ProtagonistA was right and ProtagonistA did want ProtagonistA to kill ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's time and went home . ProtagonistB had to talk to ProtagonistA and find out what was going on . 
On the night when the corpse of Bob was found , ProtagonistA , died , a very unhappy death , which was neither premeditated nor foreseen . It was a great shock to all who knew ProtagonistA , for ProtagonistA had always been a kind and gentle lady , loved by all who knew ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's death was a great tragedy , and it was made all the more tragic by the fact that ProtagonistA's only son , Lord Herveyth , was the one who murdered ProtagonistA . 
The last things ProtagonistA heard said ProtagonistA was going to die . ProtagonistA did n't want to believe it , but the more ProtagonistA thought about it , the more it made sense . ProtagonistA was old and sick , and ProtagonistA had been getting weaker and weaker for months . It was only a matter of time before ProtagonistA's body gave out . ProtagonistA tried to stay positive , but it was hard . ProtagonistA did n't want to die . ProtagonistA had so much still to do . But ProtagonistA knew that it was inevitable . ProtagonistA could n't fight it any longer . ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA's goodbyes to ProtagonistA's family and friends , and then ProtagonistA lay down to die . ProtagonistA was at peace with ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's decision . As ProtagonistA drifted off to sleep , ProtagonistA thought about all the good times ProtagonistA had in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had lived a good life , and ProtagonistA was ready to move on to the next one . 
On the afternoon of February 21st , 1780 , I was travelling with ProtagonistA , through the streets and alleys of London , when ProtagonistA suddenly stopped in front of a room in the Campus of Trinity College . ProtagonistA was reading an article in the New - York Tribune , while we were walking between Eton two miles away . I was curious as to what had caught ProtagonistA's attention and went to take a look . The headline read :  American Revolution : King George III Declares War on the Colonies  . ProtagonistA was engrossed in the article , and I could n't help but feel a sense of dread at the thought of another war . 
ProtagonistB was always the picture of calm and serenity . It was one of the things ProtagonistA loved about ProtagonistB . In the midst of a chaotic world , ProtagonistB was always able to find peace . Today , however , ProtagonistA could tell something was bothering ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was quieter than usual and seemed to be lost in thought . ProtagonistA gently asked ProtagonistB what was wrong . After a moment 's hesitation , ProtagonistB confided in ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was worried about a family member who was ill . ProtagonistA listened patiently as ProtagonistB spoke , offering words of comfort and support . Eventually , ProtagonistB began to feel better . ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA could be there for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that , no matter what , ProtagonistB would always be the picture of calm and serenity . 
ProtagonistA went over to the wharf , where three anchor - ships stood ready to receive ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had been planning this trip for weeks and was finally able to set sail . The sun was just peeking over the horizon as ProtagonistA left the dock and headed out to sea . ProtagonistA had never felt so free . 
There is something about ProtagonistA that makes ProtagonistA's body speak to us . ProtagonistA's voice makes us feel at once like ProtagonistA was there . It 's as if ProtagonistA's very presence fills the room and commands our attention . ProtagonistA has a way of carrying ProtagonistA that is both strong and gentle , and ProtagonistA's eyes seem to hold the wisdom of the ages . When ProtagonistA speaks , we ca n't help but listen . ProtagonistA is a natural leader , and people are drawn to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA has a way of making everyone feel comfortable and accepted , and ProtagonistA's laughter is infectious . ProtagonistA has a heart for people , and ProtagonistA always goes out of ProtagonistA's way to help others . ProtagonistA 's the kind of person who makes the world a better place just by being in it . We are lucky to know ProtagonistA , and we are better people for having ProtagonistA in our lives . 
I find it difficult to believe ProtagonistB ever did anything so bizarre as make ProtagonistA believe that ProtagonistA was immortal . It seems so out of character for ProtagonistB . I can remember when I was younger , ProtagonistB would always tell me that ProtagonistB needed to be careful with ProtagonistB's words because they could never be taken back . So , for ProtagonistB to tell ProtagonistA something like that , it must have been for a good reason . I can only imagine that ProtagonistB was trying to teach ProtagonistA a lesson about life . 
ProtagonistA had been in the hospital wing for what felt like forever . ProtagonistA's ' insane accident ' had been a long , hard day , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel stir crazy . The nurses and doctors were nice , but ProtagonistA was ready to go home . Finally , ProtagonistA's doctor came in and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could go home . ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA could barely contain ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA said goodbye to the nurses and doctors and made ProtagonistA's way out to the parking lot . ProtagonistA was surprised to see ProtagonistA's car there . ProtagonistA did n't remember driving to the hospital . ProtagonistA must have been in more of a state than ProtagonistA thought . ProtagonistA got in ProtagonistA's car and drove home , feeling grateful that ProtagonistA was finally out of the hospital . 
ProtagonistA was eight years old when ProtagonistA heard the story and the story just was n't the same anymore . ProtagonistA had always loved the story of the three little pigs , but now that ProtagonistA knew how the story really ended , ProtagonistA just could n't enjoy it the same way . The thought of the wolf eating the poor little pig made ProtagonistA feel sick to ProtagonistA's stomach . ProtagonistA tried to forget about it , but every time ProtagonistA heard the story , ProtagonistA just could n't help but think about the gruesome ending . 
ProtagonistA's life had been a series of dark rooms . ProtagonistA had never seen the light of day , but ProtagonistA had heard stories of it . ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA was ever going to live , ProtagonistA must find the golden door . ProtagonistA had seen it in ProtagonistA's dreams and ProtagonistA was sure it was real . ProtagonistA spent ProtagonistA's days searching for it , and when ProtagonistA found it , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get out . ProtagonistA walked through the door and into the light . 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's studio , working on a new painting , when ProtagonistA heard the doorbell ring . ProtagonistA smiled and peered into the frame to see what the matter was , but ProtagonistA soon realised that it was nothing more than a routine visit from ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was very sorry to see that ProtagonistA's work was not what ProtagonistB had hoped for , and ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA could recommend any other artists whose work ProtagonistB might like . ProtagonistA was happy to oblige , and ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB a few names of some other painters whose work ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB might enjoy . 
ProtagonistA stood on the deck of the ship as the sun sank into the horizon . ProtagonistA could n't help but stare at the beautiful sight . As ProtagonistA watched , ProtagonistA felt a mix of contempt and fascination . ProtagonistA was disgusted by the way humanity could pollute and destroy such a beautiful thing , but ProtagonistA was also mesmerized by its power and beauty . 
ProtagonistA had been put out of ProtagonistA's misery , but ProtagonistA had not been without a struggle for days . ProtagonistA had actually considered ProtagonistA unlucky . It all started when ProtagonistA lost ProtagonistA's job . ProtagonistA was a good worker and had been with the company for years , but when the recession hit , ProtagonistA was one of the first to go . ProtagonistA tried to find other work , but it was hard to come by . ProtagonistA started to get behind on ProtagonistA's bills and soon found ProtagonistA homeless . ProtagonistA was living on the streets , eating out of dumpsters , and doing whatever ProtagonistA could to survive . ProtagonistA had been reduced to begging for money just to buy food . ProtagonistA was miserable and felt like ProtagonistA had no way out . One day , ProtagonistA was begging for money outside of a grocery store . A kind - hearted woman took pity on ProtagonistA and gave ProtagonistA a few dollars . ProtagonistA was so grateful that ProtagonistA decided to use the money to buy a lottery ticket . To ProtagonistA's amazement , ProtagonistA won the jackpot ! ProtagonistA was suddenly a millionaire . ProtagonistA was able to get off the streets , get a nice place to live , and start fresh . However , ProtagonistA's good fortune did n't last long . ProtagonistA started to gamble and soon lost all of ProtagonistA's money . ProtagonistA was back to where ProtagonistA started . ProtagonistA was homeless and penniless . ProtagonistA realized then that ProtagonistA had been lucky to win the lottery in the first place and that it was ProtagonistA's own fault that ProtagonistA was in the situation ProtagonistA was in . ProtagonistA was miserable and felt like there was no way out . One day , ProtagonistA was begging for money outside of a grocery store .

ProtagonistA was miserable and felt like there was no way out . ProtagonistA had been struggling for days , and ProtagonistA was tired of it . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had no other choice but to end it all . ProtagonistA did n't want to be a burden to anyone anymore . ProtagonistA went to the local grocery store and bought a bottle of pills . ProtagonistA took them all and lay down to die . Fortunately , the pills were only over - the - counter medication and not something more serious . ProtagonistA woke up the next day , realizing that ProtagonistA had been foolish to try and take ProtagonistA's own life . ProtagonistA was still alive and still had a chance to turn things around . ProtagonistA decided then and there to get help and turn ProtagonistA's life around . ProtagonistA went to rehab and got clean . ProtagonistA found a job and slowly started to rebuild ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA is now happy and healthy and is grateful to be alive . 
ProtagonistA is best , for now , when the only thing that matters is that ProtagonistA feels loved , and is acknowledged as such , some of the time , and not always . ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA is not the best person in the world , but ProtagonistA also knows that ProtagonistA is not the worst . ProtagonistA just wants to be loved , and to feel like ProtagonistA matters . Sometimes , ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA does matter , and other times , ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA does n't . It all depends on the day , and on the people around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA just wants to be loved , and to feel like ProtagonistA matters . 
ProtagonistA was fresh out of college and ready to start ProtagonistA's career . ProtagonistA had been through a few interviews , but none of them had gone well . ProtagonistA was getting desperate . ProtagonistA had no money and no prospects . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw an ad for a job that sounded perfect for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA went to the interview and it went well . ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA had the job in the bag . But then , on the way out , ProtagonistB stopped ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's face was marked and ProtagonistA did n't have the faintest idea of how to make it look serious . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB did n't think ProtagonistA was ready for the job and that ProtagonistA should try again in a few years . ProtagonistA was crushed . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and went home . ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do now . ProtagonistA was out of options . 
In the year of God , or , rather , of the Year during which ProtagonistA lived , or perhaps was there , about the end of the last century , ProtagonistA , began to be concerned about the state of ProtagonistA's house , and lost all patience with those who prostituted it . ProtagonistA had always been a man of some means , and had never been one to allow ProtagonistA's house to fall into disrepair . But now , as ProtagonistA looked around ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA saw that it was in a state of complete ruin . The walls were cracked , the windows were broken , and the roof was caving in . ProtagonistA was horrified . ProtagonistA called a meeting of the Board of Trustees , of which ProtagonistA was the chairman , and demanded that something be done about the state of the house . The other members of the Board were equally horrified , and they immediately set about trying to find a way to raise the necessary funds to restore the house to its former glory . ProtagonistA donated a large sum of money to the cause , and ProtagonistA also began to raise funds from other sources . ProtagonistA was determined to see ProtagonistA's house restored to its former glory , and ProtagonistA was willing to do whatever it took to make that happen . It took a number of years , but eventually , the house was restored to its original condition . ProtagonistA was extremely proud of what ProtagonistA had accomplished , and ProtagonistA was grateful to all those who had helped ProtagonistA to achieve ProtagonistA's goal . 
You ca n't win ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA 's still got a lot of weight on ProtagonistA's bones . But that does n't mean ProtagonistA ca n't be a winner . ProtagonistA is a big man , and ProtagonistA 's not afraid of a little competition . ProtagonistA 's been working hard to lose weight , and ProtagonistA 's down to ProtagonistA's last few pounds . ProtagonistA is determined to win this contest . ProtagonistA 's been following the diet and exercise plan to the letter , and ProtagonistA 's feeling good . ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA can do it . The day of the contest arrives , and ProtagonistA is ready . ProtagonistA 's nervous , but ProtagonistA 's also excited . ProtagonistA 's put in the work , and now it 's time to see if it pays off . The contest is close , but in the end , ProtagonistA is the winner . ProtagonistA 's lost the weight , and ProtagonistA 's feeling great . ProtagonistA 's done it ! 
ProtagonistA had been working at ProtagonistA's job for about a month and a half , and ProtagonistA was starting to get into a routine . ProtagonistA would usually come home from work , eat dinner , and then either watch TV or work on some project that ProtagonistA had been meaning to start . However , one Monday evening , before ProtagonistA had settled into ProtagonistA's routine , ProtagonistA decided to make a discovery . ProtagonistA had been walking home from work , and ProtagonistA noticed a small alley that ProtagonistA had never noticed before . ProtagonistA decided to explore it , and ProtagonistA found a small door that led to a staircase . ProtagonistA climbed the staircase , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA on the roof of the building . ProtagonistA could see the entire city from up there , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had discovered something special . 
ProtagonistA was always a truth seeker . ProtagonistA was never one to take things at face value and was always looking for the hidden meaning behind everything . This led ProtagonistA to start a website called Truth-ism.com . On the site , ProtagonistA dedicated a new page to the truth behind everything ProtagonistA could find . Sadly , ProtagonistA passed away in early 2013 . However , ProtagonistA left behind a legacy in the form of ProtagonistA's website . On the day of ProtagonistA's death , ProtagonistA dedicated a new page to ProtagonistA's site , titled Truthism . This page contained the same content as the original site , but with a new title . ProtagonistA's passion for seeking the truth was evident in everything ProtagonistA did . Even in death , ProtagonistA was still dedicated to sharing ProtagonistA's findings with the world . ProtagonistA's website continues to be a source of information for truth seekers everywhere . 
It was about twelve years ago , in the year of the twelfth moon , that ProtagonistA , after sitting on ProtagonistA's throne as though ProtagonistA had been sitting for days , died . The people of the kingdom were in mourning for ProtagonistA , and a new king had to be chosen . The council of elders met to discuss who would be the new king , and they decided on ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a good man , and they thought ProtagonistB would be a good king . ProtagonistB was crowned the new king , and ProtagonistB ruled the kingdom well . ProtagonistB was a just and fair king , and the people loved ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB ruled for many years , and then he too died . Once again , the people were in mourning , and a new king had to be chosen . This time , the council of elders chose ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was a good king , but ProtagonistC was not as loved as ProtagonistB had been . ProtagonistC was a fair and just king , but the people did n't seem to connect with ProtagonistC the way they had with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistC ruled for a few years , and then ProtagonistC too died . Once again , the people were in mourning , and a new king had to be chosen . This time , the council of elders chose ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD was a good king , but ProtagonistD was not as loved as ProtagonistD's father or grandfather had been . ProtagonistD was a fair and just king , but the people did n't seem to connect with ProtagonistD the way they had with ProtagonistB or ProtagonistC . ProtagonistD ruled for a few years , and then he too died . And so it went , for twelve years , the cycle repeating itself over and over . The people of the kingdom were in mourning for ProtagonistA , and a new king had to be chosen . And each time , the new king was not as loved as the last . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider . ProtagonistA saw things differently than other people and ProtagonistA always spoke ProtagonistA's mind , no matter how unpopular ProtagonistA's opinions were . This made ProtagonistA a lot of enemies over the years , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA was happy being different . But then , one day , something happened that changed everything . ProtagonistA began to see things that were n't really there . ProtagonistA would see people 's faces change into monsters or hear their voices turn into demonic whispers . It was like ProtagonistA was living in a nightmare . ProtagonistA tried to tell ProtagonistA that it was n't real , but the more ProtagonistA tried to ignore the hallucinations , the worse they got . Eventually , ProtagonistA was so scared and paranoid that ProtagonistA could n't leave ProtagonistA's house . ProtagonistA was a prisoner in ProtagonistA's own mind . The only thing that kept ProtagonistA going was the hope that one day ProtagonistA would wake up from this nightmare and everything would go back to normal . But that day never came . 
In the year of our Lord , ProtagonistA was expelled from the University of Stirling , because ProtagonistA had attempted to overthrow a treaty of peace made between the university and the Royal Society , which was published in the Royal Society 's organ for the time , and was dated the previous October , 1783 . ProtagonistA had been a student at the University of Stirling for two years , and was a member of the Royal Society . ProtagonistA was a bright young man , and had a promising future ahead of ProtagonistA . However , ProtagonistA's world came crashing down when ProtagonistA was expelled from the university . ProtagonistA was devastated , and did n't know what to do with ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was tempted to give up on ProtagonistA's dreams , and just become a regular person . But something inside ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA to keep fighting , and to never give up on ProtagonistA's dreams . So , ProtagonistA decided to start ProtagonistA's own society , which ProtagonistA called the  New Royal Society  . ProtagonistA was determined to make it better than the old one , and to prove to the world that ProtagonistA was the best . The New Royal Society quickly gained a following , and ProtagonistA became a well - known figure in the scientific community . ProtagonistA made many breakthroughs , and helped to advance the field of science . ProtagonistA's work was finally recognized by the University of Stirling , and ProtagonistA was given an honorary degree . ProtagonistA had finally achieved ProtagonistA's dream , and had proved to the world that ProtagonistA was the best . 
One morning , however , the fantastic form of ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA had any idea what a plot was .  A plot , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB ,  is a plan or scheme , usually secret , to accomplish some desired end . Now , do ProtagonistA have any idea what the desired end of ProtagonistB's plot might be ?   ProtagonistA 'm afraid not , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA 'm just a simple farmer , and ProtagonistA do n't know much about such things .   Well , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB 'll tell ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB plan to take over the world !   The world !  said ProtagonistA .  That 's a mighty big ambition , ProtagonistB . But why do ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA ?   ProtagonistB do n't need ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB ,  but ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA might like to help ProtagonistB . After all , it would be a great adventure , and ProtagonistA would be richly rewarded .   ProtagonistA do n't know , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA .  It sounds like a lot of trouble .   Trouble !  said ProtagonistB .  What do ProtagonistA mean , trouble ? There 's no trouble at all . It 's all been planned out . Everything is under control . There 's nothing to it but to do it !   ProtagonistA do n't know , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA .  It all sounds very complicated to ProtagonistA .   Complicated !  said ProtagonistB .  It 's not complicated at all . It 's quite simple , really . ProtagonistA just have to have faith in ProtagonistB .   ProtagonistA do n't know , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA 'm just a simple farmer , and ProtagonistA do n't know anything about taking over the world .   That 's all right , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB 'll teach ProtagonistA everything ProtagonistA need to know . Just have faith in ProtagonistB .   All right , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA 'll try .  
ProtagonistA woke up in the morning and ProtagonistA could n't remember who had killed ProtagonistA's grandad . ProtagonistA got out of bed and went downstairs , and ProtagonistA saw the police officer who had come to arrest ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was shocked and ProtagonistA could n't believe it . ProtagonistA asked the officer what was going on , and the officer told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had killed ProtagonistA's grandad . ProtagonistA could n't believe it , and ProtagonistA asked the officer to take ProtagonistA to the station . 
 You 're not going to believe it ,  said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA opened the stack of papers on the table .  ProtagonistA 've been working on this project for months , and ProtagonistA finally have everything ProtagonistA need to make it happen . ProtagonistA had been working on a secret project for months , and it was finally coming together . ProtagonistA had been able to secure the funding and the resources ProtagonistA needed , and now all ProtagonistA needed was the green light from ProtagonistB . I'm going to present it to ProtagonistB tomorrow ,  ProtagonistA continued .  And ProtagonistA think ProtagonistB 's going to go for it . ProtagonistA just know it . ProtagonistA was confident in ProtagonistA's project , and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would see the potential . ProtagonistA had put in the work and ProtagonistA was ready for it to pay off . The next day , ProtagonistA went into ProtagonistB's office and presented ProtagonistA's project . ProtagonistB was impressed with what ProtagonistA had put together , and ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA the go - ahead . ProtagonistA was thrilled , and ProtagonistA could n't wait to get started on ProtagonistA's project . It was finally happening , and ProtagonistA was going to make it a success . 
ProtagonistA had ordered ProtagonistA's men to bring ProtagonistA an escape pod from Paris . ProtagonistA knew that the city was about to be overrun by the enemy , and ProtagonistA wanted to be able to get away if things went bad . ProtagonistA's men were able to find a pod and bring it to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was able to get away just in time . 
Several hours before ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA had written to ProtagonistA's sister:I'm sorry ProtagonistA have n't been in touch more often . ProtagonistA know we 've grown apart over the years , but ProtagonistA still love ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistB can find it in ProtagonistB's heart to forgive ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB read the letter after ProtagonistA had passed away . ProtagonistB was surprised and touched by ProtagonistA's words . Even though they had n't been close , ProtagonistB still loved ProtagonistA and was glad ProtagonistA had reached out to ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's final moments . 
ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's bloody scar on ProtagonistA's forehead in the fact that ProtagonistA had been shot in the back of the head , and ProtagonistA's left arm sticking out from underneath the elbow . The doctors had told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was lucky to be alive , but ProtagonistA did n't feel so lucky . ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's job , ProtagonistA's wife had left ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's children never wanted to see ProtagonistA . All because of that stupid scar . ProtagonistA had tried to hide it , but it was always there , a constant reminder of that fateful day . 
The huge globe had been a source of great fascination for ProtagonistA ever since ProtagonistA was a young boy . ProtagonistA would spend hours staring at it , wondering what it was made of and how it got there . ProtagonistA's father had told ProtagonistA that it was a gift from the gods and that it was meant to protect the city from harm . ProtagonistA was skeptical , but ProtagonistA could n't deny that the globe had a certain power about it . As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to understand the true purpose of the globe . It was a symbol of ProtagonistA's father 's greatness and a reminder of the family 's legacy . ProtagonistA was proud to be the son of the man who had brought such a magnificent object to the city . Now , as ProtagonistA gazed at the globe , ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and calm . ProtagonistA knew that as long as the globe was there , the city would be safe . 
ProtagonistB always said , if you put ProtagonistA on the moon , ProtagonistA would go crazy . ProtagonistB was always warning me about the dangers of space travel , but I never listened . I was determined to be the first person to walk on the moon , and nothing was going to stop me . ProtagonistA was my best friend , and ProtagonistA was always up for a challenge . So when I told ProtagonistA about my plan to put ProtagonistA on the moon , ProtagonistA was all for it . We started making preparations right away . It took a lot of work , but we finally managed to get ProtagonistA to the moon . ProtagonistA was a little apprehensive at first , but ProtagonistA soon got used to the idea . And when ProtagonistA stepped out of the spaceship , ProtagonistA was the first person to walk on the moon . ProtagonistA was up there for less than a minute when we heard ProtagonistA screaming . We rushed back into the spaceship to find ProtagonistA ranting and raving like a madman . ProtagonistA's eyes were wild and ProtagonistA's hair was standing on end . It was clear that ProtagonistA had gone crazy . ProtagonistB was right - space travel is dangerous . If only I had listened to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would be safe at home on Earth instead of being a lunatic on the moon . 
ProtagonistA had been in and out of court more times than ProtagonistA could count . As usual , when ProtagonistA appeared before the judge , ProtagonistA carried a small silver bird . The bird had a beak like a black - crowned gull , and a silver piece of lead . The judge looked at ProtagonistA and shook his head .  I 'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but I 'm going to have to sentence ProtagonistA to two weeks in jail . I hope ProtagonistA can turn ProtagonistA's life around . ProtagonistA sighed as ProtagonistA was led away by the bailiff . ProtagonistA knew that this was n't the end for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA would be back in court again , and ProtagonistA would continue to carry ProtagonistA's silver bird with ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had not been awake for more than ten minutes when ProtagonistA was informed that there was ProtagonistB waiting for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a bit surprised , as ProtagonistA was not expecting any visitors . ProtagonistA got up and went to the living room , where ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB sitting on the couch . ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as Sarah , and said that ProtagonistB was a friend of ProtagonistA's son . ProtagonistA's son had told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was a bit of a recluse and never left the house , so ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistB would come and visit ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was pleased to have a visitor and they spent the next few hours chatting and getting to know each other . 
The three men were sitting on the front steps of ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA rolled slowly through the long , winding streets of Mexico City . They were all smoking cigars and drinking whiskey , and they were all feeling very pleased with themselves . They had just pulled off a heist at the local bank , and they were now on their way to a safe house to count their loot . As they rolled along , they began to notice that they were being followed by a black SUV . They tried to lose it , but it stayed with them . Eventually , they realized that they were being boxed in by the SUV and another car . They were about to be ambushed . ProtagonistA slammed on the brakes and the three men leapt out of the car . They began firing at their attackers , and they soon had them on the run . The three men cheered and high - fived each other . They had just made a clean getaway . 
In the year 1789 , ProtagonistA was making a tour of the country . While in England , ProtagonistA had written a remarkable book which described all the events of ProtagonistA's country . ProtagonistA had also written some notes relating to a particular town of that name , called Merseyside . ProtagonistA had been fascinated by the town ever since ProtagonistA had first heard of it . ProtagonistA had read about its history and its people , and ProtagonistA had even visited it once before . But this time , ProtagonistA wanted to see it for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA arrived in the town on a sunny day in August . The streets were busy with people going about their business . ProtagonistA walked around , taking everything in . ProtagonistA stopped to talk to some of the locals and to get a feel for the place . ProtagonistA was struck by how friendly everyone was . They were always willing to stop and chat , and they seemed to be genuinely interested in ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's story . ProtagonistA felt right at home . ProtagonistA spent a few days exploring the town and its surroundings . ProtagonistA was particularly interested in the docks , where ProtagonistA watched the ships coming and going .

The servant 's room was now a cozy little apartment that was perfect for ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was a very pretty girl , far too pretty for ProtagonistA's age . ProtagonistA always felt out of place in ProtagonistA's small town , like ProtagonistA was meant for something more .

ProtagonistA was driving along the street when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . They chatted easily as they strolled along , and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA telling ProtagonistB all about ProtagonistA's life .

ProtagonistA had said it was fine ; it was , as it were , the best thing that ever happened to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA felt that it had been the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA . It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was out in the park , enjoying the sunshine and the fresh air . ProtagonistA was happy and content , and ProtagonistA felt that everything was right with the world . 
ProtagonistA had been married for 20 years and had 2 kids . ProtagonistA was a middle - aged man and was starting to feel the effects of time . ProtagonistA's hair was thinning and ProtagonistA's waistline was expanding . ProtagonistA had been a stay - at - home dad for the past few years , but ProtagonistA's wife had recently gone back to work . ProtagonistA was feeling a bit lost and was n't sure what ProtagonistA's purpose was anymore . One day , ProtagonistA was out for a walk and ProtagonistA saw a sign for a baking class . ProtagonistA had always loved baking and cooking , so ProtagonistA decided to sign up . ProtagonistA went to the first class and loved it . ProtagonistA met a lot of new people and felt like ProtagonistA belonged there . The class was filled with people of all ages , but ProtagonistA felt most comfortable with the other middle - aged students . ProtagonistA started going to the baking class every week and it quickly became ProtagonistA's favorite thing to do . ProtagonistA loved trying new recipes and learning new techniques . The other students were always impressed with ProtagonistA's creations . ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA was finally doing something with ProtagonistA's life that ProtagonistA was passionate about . The baking class gave ProtagonistA a new sense of purpose and ProtagonistA was finally happy again . 
ProtagonistA was nine years old when ProtagonistA first heard of the death of ProtagonistC . It was a cold winter day and ProtagonistA was inside playing with ProtagonistA's toys . ProtagonistB was in the kitchen cooking dinner when the phone rang . ProtagonistA could tell by the look on ProtagonistB's face that something was wrong . After ProtagonistB hung up the phone , ProtagonistB came into the living room and sat down next to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC had been in a car accident and ProtagonistC was gone . ProtagonistA did n't understand what that meant at first , but ProtagonistA soon realized that ProtagonistC was never coming home . ProtagonistA was sad for a long time after that . 
ProtagonistA's uncle told ProtagonistA a story about a beetle that landed in a tall , dark , green tree . ProtagonistA was six years old at the time , and ProtagonistA sat in the room and watched as the beetle made its landing . The beetle was very small , but it was able to climb to the top of the tree with ease . Once it reached the top , the beetle looked around and then began to descend back down the tree . ProtagonistA was fascinated by the beetle and its ability to climb the tree . 
Less than an hour after the end of the year , ProtagonistA was found murdered in ProtagonistA's apartment , ProtagonistA's throat slit . The police were called and they began their investigation . They found that ProtagonistA had been having an affair with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was married and ProtagonistC had found out about the affair . ProtagonistC was the one who killed ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was a fine , cheerful , cheerful girl of fifteen years of age , who had a cheerful manner , and good sense , but no very good sense ; and though ProtagonistA was wo nt to be a good - humoured and a happy - go - lucky girl , ProtagonistA was not without a certain air of melancholy . ProtagonistA had been brought up by ProtagonistA's father and mother in a small village in the north of England , and had never been taught anything but to be a good - natured , happy - go - lucky girl . But ProtagonistA's father had died when ProtagonistA was ten years old , and ProtagonistB had married again , and ProtagonistA had been sent to live with ProtagonistA's stepfather in a large town . Here ProtagonistA had been put to work in a factory , and had soon become discontented and unhappy . ProtagonistA had never been able to please ProtagonistA's stepfather , who was a stern , hard man , and ProtagonistA had grown to hate the work in the factory . The only thing that had kept ProtagonistA from leaving home and going out into the world to seek ProtagonistA's fortune was ProtagonistB's entreaties that ProtagonistA would not desert ProtagonistB . But at last ProtagonistA's stepfather had turned ProtagonistA out of doors , and ProtagonistA had been obliged to wander forth into the world to seek ProtagonistA's fortune . 
When ProtagonistA was three years old , ProtagonistA was brought to bay in the arms of a British soldier . ProtagonistA was too young to understand what was happening , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was in danger . The soldier held ProtagonistA close and protectively as they made their way through the battle that was raging around them . Bullets flew past them , and explosions shook the ground , but the soldier never faltered . Finally , they made it to safety and ProtagonistA was reunited with ProtagonistA's family . ProtagonistA would never forget the brave soldier who saved ProtagonistA's life . 
Now , what is it ? said ProtagonistC to the old woman who lay on ProtagonistA back in a critical state , trying to escape the vault with ProtagonistA's head down , as if ProtagonistA had suddenly realized what it was ProtagonistA had been planning . It 's the TARDIS ,  ProtagonistB gasped .  ProtagonistB 've been trying to tell ProtagonistC . The TARDIS is in the vault . The Doctor 's eyes widened .  The TARDIS ? But how?I do n't know ,  ProtagonistB said .  But it 's there . ProtagonistB can feel it . The Doctor hesitated for a moment , then nodded .  All right . ProtagonistC 'll go take a look . ProtagonistC turned to ProtagonistA .  Can ProtagonistA carry ProtagonistA nodded , and ProtagonistC lifted ProtagonistB onto ProtagonistA's back . Be careful ,  ProtagonistB said .  The TARDIS is ... alive . The Doctor nodded again , then turned and ran back into the vault . ProtagonistA followed close behind , ProtagonistB clinging to ProtagonistA tightly . They could hear ProtagonistC's voice echoing through the vault as ProtagonistC called out to the TARDIS.Suddenly , there was a blinding flash of light , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistB go limp in ProtagonistA's arms . ProtagonistC came running back out of the vault , a look of shock on ProtagonistC's face . What happened ?  ProtagonistA asked . I'm not sure ,  ProtagonistC said ,  but ProtagonistC think the TARDIS is gone .  
One cold , gray November day , after a long winter 's heat , and a placid and happy season of summer , ProtagonistA , lay on ProtagonistA's bed in the green garden of ProtagonistA's maternal grandmother 's , thinking of the wholesome things that a well - ordered house could do for the comfort of the mind and body , without the extra expense of a large house , or a great purchase of land , or any other thing of the kind ; and in consequence of these wholesome things , the mind and body improved so much , that from the time that ProtagonistA was quite able to think , ProtagonistA could form any idea , no matter how dim and conflicting , regarding any particular object or thing , unless absolutely absolutely necessary ; and ProtagonistA thus became a very pretty , and very intelligent , and very happy woman , and saved ProtagonistA's family much distress , expense , and trouble , and earned in itself a considerable profit . 
ProtagonistA sat down in the heather green armchair in ProtagonistA's little office and talked .  ProtagonistA 'm so tired of all this ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA just want to retire and live in peace .  ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA sympathetically .  ProtagonistB know , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  But ProtagonistA ca n't just leave ProtagonistA's job . ProtagonistA have to finish what ProtagonistA started .  ProtagonistA sighed and nodded . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was right . But ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like ProtagonistA was already retired , living in a world of ProtagonistA's own . 
ProtagonistA was sleeping and felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA woke up with a start and saw that ProtagonistA's pillow was covered in blood . ProtagonistA quickly got out of bed and went to the bathroom to see what was happening . ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistA's head was bleeding profusely and ProtagonistA quickly applied pressure to the wound to try and stop the bleeding . ProtagonistA then called for an ambulance and was taken to the hospital . 
ProtagonistA had always loved sports . As a child , ProtagonistA would play any and every sport ProtagonistA could . ProtagonistA loved the feeling of competition and the rush of adrenaline that came with it . As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA's love for sports only grew . ProtagonistA became a star athlete in high school and went on to play in college . Now , ProtagonistA is a professional athlete . ProtagonistA 's one of the best in ProtagonistA's sport and ProtagonistA 's loved by fans all over the world . ProtagonistA 's made a name for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA 's living ProtagonistA's dream . But even though ProtagonistA 's achieved so much , ProtagonistA still has that same childish love for sports . And ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA always will . 
On a certain day in the year 1812 , during the drifting days of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's father , who had a small fortune of a few thousand pounds , suddenly died . ProtagonistA was left with nothing but a small inheritance . ProtagonistA was forced to find a job to support ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA found a job as a clerk in a small office . ProtagonistA was not very good at ProtagonistA's job and was often scolded by ProtagonistA's boss . One day , while ProtagonistA was working , ProtagonistA received a letter from ProtagonistA's father 's lawyer . The letter said that ProtagonistA's father had left ProtagonistA a large sum of money . ProtagonistA was overjoyed . ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's job and went to live a life of luxury . 
ProtagonistB had known ProtagonistA since they were both in diapers . They had grown up together and been through everything together . ProtagonistA was like a sister to ProtagonistB . When their parents died , it was ProtagonistA who stepped up and took care of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was the one who made sure ProtagonistB had food and shelter . ProtagonistA was the one who made sure ProtagonistB went to school and got an education . ProtagonistA was the one who made sure ProtagonistB had a job and was able to support ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was the one who was always there for ProtagonistB , no matter what . Now , ProtagonistB was the one who was there for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was going through a tough time and ProtagonistB wanted to be there for ProtagonistA , just like ProtagonistA had been there for ProtagonistB all those years ago . ProtagonistB wanted to help ProtagonistA through this tough time , just like ProtagonistA had helped ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB wanted to be the one person ProtagonistA could rely on , just like ProtagonistA had been the one person ProtagonistB could always rely on . 
ProtagonistA had always been a happy - go - lucky guy . ProtagonistA was always smiling and joking around . But then , one day , something happened that changed ProtagonistA forever . ProtagonistA was out walking ProtagonistC when ProtagonistA saw a group of kids playing in the park . ProtagonistB , was crying . ProtagonistA went over to see what was wrong and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC had run away . ProtagonistA helped ProtagonistB look for ProtagonistC , but they could n't find ProtagonistC anywhere . ProtagonistB was so sad and ProtagonistA felt terrible . ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistB was so happy and ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistA . But after that day , ProtagonistA was never the same . ProtagonistA was always looking for lost dogs and helping people find them . ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's calling . 
ProtagonistA was borne in the City of London , between eight and ten o'clock , on Tuesday , the twenty - first day of June , 1688 . ProtagonistA was born to the Island of Dunk , in the Sound of the Sea , where ProtagonistA remained until the arrival of the King 's Majesty . ProtagonistA was a strong and healthy baby , and ProtagonistA thrived in the care of the islanders . The King 's Majesty was pleased with ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was given a place in the royal court . ProtagonistA served the King faithfully for many years , and ProtagonistA was loved by all who knew ProtagonistA . 
The sun rose red in the sky , and ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's gleaming blue eyes bored into the dark depths of the ocean , a sight ProtagonistB had surely seen many times before . But to ProtagonistA , it was new and exciting , and ProtagonistA could n't help but stare . ProtagonistB , seeing ProtagonistA's fascination , came over and explained what ProtagonistB was looking at . The ocean , ProtagonistB said , was full of life , even down in the dark depths where the sun could n't reach . ProtagonistA was amazed , and ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's time . 
One day , when ProtagonistA was about twelve years old , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were riding in the back of a coach through the suburbs of New York . They were on their way to pick up ProtagonistA's sister from school . As they rode , ProtagonistA looked out the window and saw a group of boys playing ball in a park . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could be out there with them , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be with ProtagonistB . Suddenly , the coach came to a stop . ProtagonistB got out to see what was happening . ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA saw that the coach 's wheel had come off . ProtagonistC was trying to fix it , but ProtagonistC could n't . ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistC if ProtagonistC could take them to the nearest house . ProtagonistC said ProtagonistC could and ProtagonistB got back in the coach with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistC took them to a big house . ProtagonistD came to the door and ProtagonistB asked if ProtagonistB could use ProtagonistB's phone . ProtagonistD said ProtagonistD could and ProtagonistB went inside with ProtagonistD . ProtagonistA waited outside with ProtagonistC . After a few minutes , ProtagonistB came back out and said they were going to have to wait for a while for ProtagonistA's sister . ProtagonistA was disappointed , but ProtagonistA knew there was nothing ProtagonistA could do . 
ProtagonistA preserved all ProtagonistA's memories in a jar . Every day , ProtagonistA would add a new memory to the jar . ProtagonistA started with the day ProtagonistA was born . ProtagonistA added ProtagonistA's first steps , ProtagonistA's first words , and ProtagonistA's first day of school . ProtagonistA added the day ProtagonistA met ProtagonistA's best friend , the day ProtagonistA got ProtagonistA's first pet , and the day ProtagonistA graduated from high school . ProtagonistA added ProtagonistA's wedding day , the birth of ProtagonistA's children , and the day ProtagonistA retired . ProtagonistA even added the day ProtagonistA died . Now , every time someone opens the jar , they can see all of ProtagonistA's memories and learn about ProtagonistA's life . 
ProtagonistA was standing at the airport , waiting for ProtagonistA's flight when ProtagonistA heard the crashing of small - arms fire and the effect of the machine gun . ProtagonistA's heart sank as ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA's plane was under attack . ProtagonistA quickly ducked for cover , but not before ProtagonistA saw the terrorists running through the terminal , shooting indiscriminately . ProtagonistA lay there for what seemed like hours , trying to stay as quiet as possible . ProtagonistA could hear the terrorists shouting to each other in a language ProtagonistA did n't understand , and the occasional burst of gunfire . ProtagonistA was terrified , and ProtagonistA's mind raced as ProtagonistA tried to think of a way to escape . Finally , after what felt like an eternity , the gunfire stopped . ProtagonistA cautiously peeked out from ProtagonistA's hiding spot and saw that the terrorists were gone . ProtagonistA quickly made ProtagonistA's way to the nearest exit and ran out into the safety of the night . 
There was once ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was very little , and ProtagonistA was very passionate . ProtagonistA was passionate about everything ProtagonistA did , and ProtagonistA did n't care what anyone else thought . ProtagonistA was happy just doing ProtagonistA's own thing . One day , ProtagonistA decided ProtagonistA wanted to be a musician . ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistA did n't know how to play any instruments , ProtagonistA was just going to do it . So ProtagonistA started learning how to play the guitar . ProtagonistA practiced every day , and eventually ProtagonistA got pretty good . ProtagonistA started playing gigs at local clubs , and people loved ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was happy doing what ProtagonistA loved , and ProtagonistA did n't care about anything else . 
ProtagonistA was a great guy . ProtagonistA always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face and was always willing to help out . ProtagonistA was always looking for a good deal , and ProtagonistA was always looking to help people . ProtagonistA died tragically in a car accident , but ProtagonistA's legacy lives on . If you want to make a good purchase , you need to know three things about ProtagonistA : who ProtagonistA was , how ProtagonistA died , and how to make a good buy . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a klutz , so it was no surprise when ProtagonistA stepped on the monkey 's foot . The monkey screeched in pain and ProtagonistA apologized profusely . ProtagonistA offered to buy the monkey a new foot , but the monkey just wanted to be left alone . ProtagonistA respected the monkey 's wishes and went on ProtagonistA's way . 
They had been waiting for ProtagonistA like that since the day ProtagonistA 'd turned seventeen . They were always waiting for ProtagonistA , even when ProtagonistA was right in front of them . ProtagonistA was the one who got away , the one who always had something better to do . They would have given anything to have ProtagonistA back , even for just one day . ProtagonistA had been their leader , their hope . ProtagonistA was the one who always had a plan , who always knew what to do . When ProtagonistA left , they were lost . They did n't know how to function without ProtagonistA . Now , ProtagonistA was back . ProtagonistA had been gone for ten years , but it felt like a lifetime . They had all changed so much , but they were still the same people who had been waiting for ProtagonistA all those years ago . ProtagonistA looked at them and smiled .  ProtagonistA 'm back ,  ProtagonistA said . They all cheered and hugged ProtagonistA . They had finally gotten ProtagonistA back . Now , they could finally move on . 
The last time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a man . ProtagonistB was a man who was in a relationship with a woman , and they had a child together . ProtagonistB was a man who was successful in ProtagonistB's career , and ProtagonistB was a man who was happy with ProtagonistB's life . ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a man who was content with ProtagonistB's life , and ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA had been walking home from getting groceries when ProtagonistA was grabbed from behind and thrown into the back of a van . ProtagonistA was blindfolded and ProtagonistA's hands were tied behind ProtagonistA's back . The van drove for what felt like hours before coming to a stop . ProtagonistA was pushed out of the van and onto the ground . ProtagonistA heard the van drive away and ProtagonistA was left alone . ProtagonistA managed to get the blindfold off and untie ProtagonistA's hands . ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was in a forest . ProtagonistA started walking and eventually came across a road . ProtagonistA followed the road until ProtagonistA came to a town . ProtagonistA went to the police station and reported that ProtagonistA had been kidnapped . 
The first time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB dead , ProtagonistA felt the dread of death wash over ProtagonistA . It was a cold winter day and ProtagonistB had been lying in the snow for hours . ProtagonistB's skin was pale and ProtagonistB's eyes were glassy . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was gone , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a sense of dread . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to die too . 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the corner of the sofa , with ProtagonistA's head resting on the edge of the sofa , when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the kitchen . ProtagonistA got up to investigate and saw a mouse running around on the counter . ProtagonistA quickly grabbed a piece of cheese and set it down on the floor . The mouse ran over to the cheese and started eating it . ProtagonistA watched as the mouse ate the cheese and then ran away . 
ProtagonistA was walking home from work when ProtagonistA heard the cold wind howling . ProtagonistA's hair stirred and ProtagonistA's face grew red and pouted . ProtagonistA's eyes flashed with fear and ProtagonistA put out a soft smile that had the air of a quarter . ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , but the wind seemed to be following ProtagonistA . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB in the distance . ProtagonistB was getting closer and ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was a woman . ProtagonistB was wearing a white dress and ProtagonistB's hair was blowing in the wind . ProtagonistA felt a cold chill run down ProtagonistA's spine and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was in danger . ProtagonistB reached out ProtagonistB's hand and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA being pulled towards ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA tried to resist , but ProtagonistA could n't . The last thing ProtagonistA saw was ProtagonistB's cold , dead eyes before ProtagonistA was pulled into the darkness . 
ProtagonistA was always a bit of a go - getter . ProtagonistA was never content to just sit around and wait for things to happen - ProtagonistA always had to be out there , making things happen . So it 's no surprise that ProtagonistA 's now one of the richest men in the world . ProtagonistA 's got so much money that ProtagonistA sleeps in ProtagonistA's own bed every night , and ProtagonistA 's never had to worry about a thing in ProtagonistA's life . But ProtagonistA's 's not content to just sit on ProtagonistA's laurels and enjoy ProtagonistA's wealth . ProtagonistA 's always looking for new ways to make even more money . And ProtagonistA 's never afraid to take risks . That 's how ProtagonistA 's become so successful . ProtagonistA is a true inspiration to everyone around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 's shown that if you want something badly enough , you can make it happen . No matter what obstacles are in your way , you can overcome them if you set your mind to it . 
It was nt any of ProtagonistB business , and could have easily gone either way , but when ProtagonistA was walking hand in hand with a dead man ProtagonistA felt a strong urge to help . It was a hot day and the sun was beating down mercilessly . ProtagonistA was sweating profusely and ProtagonistA's grip on the mans hand was slipping . ProtagonistB could see that ProtagonistA was in a bad way and ProtagonistB felt compelled to do something . ProtagonistB approached the pair and offered to help . ProtagonistA gratefully accepted and ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA to a nearby bench where ProtagonistA could sit and rest . ProtagonistB stayed with ProtagonistA until ProtagonistA felt better and then went on ProtagonistB's way . 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC were sitting in the parlor discussing the recent death of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA's son , Bob , had been left in the care of the parsonage by his father and ProtagonistA was very grateful for that . However , ProtagonistA was also very saddened by the death of ProtagonistB and was still in mourning . Mr . Duryea , on the other hand , was not as close to ProtagonistC's brother as ProtagonistA was to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistC felt that ProtagonistB had always been a bit of a reckless adventurer and that ProtagonistB's death was not entirely unexpected . Nevertheless , ProtagonistC was still saddened by the loss and offered ProtagonistC's condolences to ProtagonistA . The two of them continued to sit in the parlor , talking about ProtagonistB and their shared memories of ProtagonistB . As they talked , they began to feel closer to each other and by the end of the conversation , they were both feeling much better . 
ProtagonistA was lying upon the ground , ProtagonistA's arms stretched out in front of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's legs crossed , ProtagonistA's head resting on the side of ProtagonistA's hands . ProtagonistA was gazing up at the clear blue sky , admiring the beauty of nature . ProtagonistA felt at peace lying there , and ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and drifted off to sleep . 
ProtagonistA's friends called ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB would not cast a glance aside , for ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA ! They had been married for 5 years , and in that time , ProtagonistA had never once looked at another man . ProtagonistA was completely devoted to ProtagonistA's husband . However , one day , ProtagonistA's friends convinced ProtagonistA to go to a gay bar with them . At first , ProtagonistA was hesitant , but ProtagonistA eventually relented . As soon as ProtagonistA walked into the bar , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was tall , muscular , and had the most beautiful blue eyes ProtagonistA had ever seen . ProtagonistC was also completely naked , save for a small pair of black shorts . ProtagonistA's friends called out to ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart racing as ProtagonistC talked to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could feel a stirring in ProtagonistA's loins . Before ProtagonistA knew it , ProtagonistA was following ProtagonistC back to ProtagonistC's place . They stripped each other down and made love all night long . In the morning , ProtagonistA snuck out , feeling guilty about what ProtagonistA had done . However , ProtagonistA could n't deny that ProtagonistA had enjoyed it immensely . From then on , ProtagonistA started going to the gay bar more and more , always hoping to run into ProtagonistC again . 
We had just left ProtagonistA , when ProtagonistA , in a singular instance , which must have occurred to most of the passengers , jumped into the sea . I was on the deck at the time , and saw ProtagonistA go over . I at once ran to the side , and looked over . There was no one in sight . ProtagonistA had evidently gone down , and I feared ProtagonistA was drowned . 
One day in August , a winter in the West , ProtagonistA came to a village to pick up ProtagonistB . It was a cold day and the village was covered in snow . ProtagonistB was excited to see ProtagonistA and ran to ProtagonistA . They hugged each other and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA how much ProtagonistB had missed ProtagonistA . They spent the day together catching up and ProtagonistA was happy to finally be able to hold ProtagonistB again . 
ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistB's head , and down at ProtagonistB's feet , and said ,  ProtagonistB 'll be ProtagonistB's companion .  ProtagonistB had always been a strong man , but now ProtagonistB was getting old and frail . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would have to take care of ProtagonistB soon . 
The night ProtagonistA rose from ProtagonistA's deepest sleep ProtagonistA was found by ProtagonistA's father in the midst of the crowd of people who were gathered below the palace . ProtagonistA's father had been searching for ProtagonistA for days , ever since ProtagonistA had gone missing . ProtagonistA had no memory of what had happened to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was happy to be back with ProtagonistA's family . 
ProtagonistA has never been one for looking up at the stars . ProtagonistA prefers to keep ProtagonistA's feet on the ground , where things are simple and ProtagonistA can understand them . But on this particular night , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA lying on ProtagonistA's back in a field , staring up at the sky in wonder . The sky is blue and black and vast with the stars , but ProtagonistA is pale and yellow and ProtagonistA's light is dim , casting a yellowish tinge over the sea of stars which stands above the earth . For a moment , ProtagonistA forgot ProtagonistA's troubles and simply marveled at the beauty of the universe . Then ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name , and ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistA's friend , waving ProtagonistA over . ProtagonistA got up and dusting ProtagonistA off , ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistA's friend back to the campsite , where they sat around the fire and talked long into the night . 
ProtagonistA sat up all night , and thought about all the things ProtagonistA had seen . ProtagonistA thought about the time ProtagonistA saw a man get hit by a car . ProtagonistA thought about the time ProtagonistA saw a woman get mugged . ProtagonistA thought about the time ProtagonistA saw a bank get robbed . ProtagonistA thought about all the violence and crime ProtagonistA had seen in ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA wondered why it was all so common . ProtagonistA wondered why people were n't kinder to each other , and why there was so much hate in the world . ProtagonistA sat up all night , and thought about these things , and ProtagonistA came to a conclusion : that the world was a cruel and violent place , and that there was nothing ProtagonistA could do to change it . 
ProtagonistA had been on the ship for weeks , and was excited to finally be nearing their destination . ProtagonistA had been looking forward to seeing ProtagonistA's family again and could n't wait to get off the ship . However , just a few miles from the bridge that would take them to safety , ProtagonistA became ill with cholera . ProtagonistB did n't want ProtagonistA to die , so ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA on the shore with some food and water . ProtagonistA died within a few days , alone and scared . ProtagonistA never got to see ProtagonistA's family again or experience the life ProtagonistA had been dreaming of . 
One morning in October , 1890 , ProtagonistA came to the friend - house in the street called Beechmere Lane , with the sign over ProtagonistA's door :  B.F.F. & SONS , PAINTERS AND DECORATORS .  ProtagonistA had been working for ProtagonistB for nearly two years , and was a good workman . But this morning ProtagonistA looked worried and anxious . What is it , ProtagonistA ?  asked ProtagonistB , when ProtagonistB had shut the door of the little office . I'm in trouble , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistC is very ill , and the doctor says ProtagonistC must have proper nursing . ProtagonistA ca n't afford to pay for it , and ProtagonistA do n't know what to do . Mr . Friend thought for a moment . Then ProtagonistB said :  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'll tell ProtagonistA what ProtagonistB 'll do . ProtagonistB 'll give ProtagonistA a month 's holiday , with full pay . ProtagonistA can go home and look after ProtagonistC . And when ProtagonistA come back , ProtagonistB 'll give ProtagonistA a rise of two shillings a week . That will help ProtagonistA to pay for the nursing . ProtagonistA's face brightened .  Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  That 's very good of ProtagonistB . And from that day ProtagonistA was a better workman than ever , for ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was a kind and considerate man . 
ProtagonistA dropped ProtagonistA's bag of toys on the ground , looked up and saw a brick - and - mortar window with a two - foot - high gap in it . ProtagonistA could see the other side of the window , but it was too high for ProtagonistA to reach . ProtagonistA thought for a moment , then grabbed ProtagonistA's bag of toys and threw it through the gap . ProtagonistA climbed up on the bag and peered through the window . ProtagonistA could see a room full of toys , but there was no way to get to them . ProtagonistA sighed and climbed down , picking up ProtagonistA's bag of toys . ProtagonistA would just have to come back another day . 
ProtagonistA had been born , with all the tender feelings and memories which ProtagonistA could bear , ProtagonistA in the year of grace 1792 , to ProtagonistB the 15th of July , in the parish of St. dernier - sur - Marne , in the town of Port Omega , in the district of the Madonnier family . ProtagonistA had been a happy baby , with a smile that could light up a room , and eyes that sparkled with mischief . ProtagonistA was loved by all who met ProtagonistA , and it was clear that ProtagonistA was destined for great things . As ProtagonistA grew , ProtagonistA continued to charm everyone ProtagonistA met . ProtagonistA was always the life and soul of the party , and ProtagonistA's infectious laughter was impossible to resist . ProtagonistA had a heart of gold , and was always ready to help anyone in need . ProtagonistA was also fiercely loyal to ProtagonistA's family and friends , and would do anything to protect them . In the year of grace 1792 , tragedy struck the Madonnier family . ProtagonistB , was killed in a hunting accident , leaving ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's mother , Marie , devastated . ProtagonistA threw ProtagonistA into ProtagonistA's studies , determined to make ProtagonistB proud .

ProtagonistA had been drinking with ProtagonistB all evening , and ProtagonistA had been told to go to bed early , for ProtagonistA was going to spend all night with ProtagonistB . However , ProtagonistA did n't want to go to bed , for ProtagonistA wanted to stay up and drink with ProtagonistB . Eventually , ProtagonistB got angry with ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA to go to bed . ProtagonistA went to bed , but ProtagonistA was so angry with ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA did n't want to talk to ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA had been reading stories to children for years . ProtagonistA loved doing it , and felt like ProtagonistA had a real gift for it . But lately , ProtagonistA 'd been feeling like ProtagonistA was losing ProtagonistA's touch . The stories ProtagonistA was reading just did n't seem to capture the imagination of the children like they used to . So when ProtagonistA had finally finished reading the story aloud to the two children , ProtagonistA had gone over the whole thing again , and felt more than ever that ProtagonistA had gone astray , to the extreme extent of the past . ProtagonistA just could n't seem to find the magic anymore . The children were both asleep by the time ProtagonistA finished , and ProtagonistA felt a heavy weight settle on ProtagonistA's chest . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA was losing ProtagonistA's touch , and that ProtagonistA would never be able to recapture the magic ProtagonistA once had . 
ProtagonistA was a blonde girl with long black hair , and while ProtagonistA knew it was only a possibility that ProtagonistA would one day be all of thirty - two , it did n't matter . The day ProtagonistA turned thirty - two , ProtagonistA woke up to find that ProtagonistA's hair had turned completely white . ProtagonistA panicked at first , but then ProtagonistA realized that it did n't change who ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA was still the same person , just with a different hair color . ProtagonistA went about ProtagonistA's day as usual , and when ProtagonistA went to bed that night , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA's hair had turned back to its original color . ProtagonistA was relieved and happy to know that ProtagonistA could still be ProtagonistA , no matter what ProtagonistA's hair color was . 
There was once ProtagonistA , and was of opinion that ProtagonistA had great moral and intellectual advantages , in comparison with ProtagonistA's neighbours , that ProtagonistA might best enjoy them , by treating them with the greatest civilities , and most affability . However , ProtagonistA's neighbours , who were of a different opinion , thought that the best way to enjoy their advantages was to treat ProtagonistA with the greatest civilities and affability . 
ProtagonistA 's coming . ProtagonistA 's coming ! ProtagonistA is on ProtagonistA's way to our house and we are so excited . We have been waiting for ProtagonistA all day . We have been talking about all the things we are going to do together . We are going to have so much fun . 
ProtagonistA was seated on the steps of the throne in the center of the court , ProtagonistA's face pale and ProtagonistA's eyes trembling as ProtagonistA looked down at the golden blade of Agredite in the hands of ProtagonistB . It was a moment ProtagonistA had been dreading for months , ever since ProtagonistA's father had announced ProtagonistA's engagement to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that this was ProtagonistA's duty , that ProtagonistA was required to marry and produce an heir , but ProtagonistA had never expected to be married to a man . Now , as ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA could see the same fear in ProtagonistB's eyes . It was clear that ProtagonistB was just as unwilling as ProtagonistA was , but there was no turning back now . The ceremony began , and ProtagonistA could do nothing but watch as ProtagonistB pledged ProtagonistB's life to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to be sick , but ProtagonistA managed to keep ProtagonistA together until the end . When it was over , they were both escorted to their separate chambers . ProtagonistA could barely look at ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA could tell that the feeling was mutual . ProtagonistA had never felt so alone , and ProtagonistA knew that this was only the beginning . 
ProtagonistA was having a tough day . First , ProtagonistA got scolded by ProtagonistA's boss at work . Then , ProtagonistA got into a fight with ProtagonistA's best friend . And to top it all off , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB would not be able to help ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's financial problems . ProtagonistA was so angry , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA's head was going to explode .

And when ProtagonistA was done , ProtagonistB applauded . 
ProtagonistA was fifteen when ProtagonistA walked into the shopper 's window of the stockade at Nightingale 's Gate . ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the room that was always there , and out of the dark , dusty floors . ProtagonistA had never seen it in person before , and ProtagonistA was amazed by the sight . The room was filled with all kinds of objects , from books to furniture to clothes . ProtagonistA did n't know what to make of it all , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA wanted to explore more . 
ProtagonistA was increasing in stature . ProtagonistA was a beautiful , cat - faced creature , but most people would admit that ProtagonistA was rather strange . ProtagonistA did n't seem to understand human emotions and often acted more like a cat than a person . One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a beautiful , snake - like creature who did n't seem to understand emotions either . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB became friends , and they would often spend time together , just talking and enjoying each other 's company . One day , they decided to go on an adventure . They went to a place where there were no humans and they could be themselves .

ProtagonistA's name was Lucy , and ProtagonistA was just seventeen when we first met . ProtagonistA was a shy , introverted boy who always seemed to be looking for a way to escape the world .

We started dating soon after that , and I was the happiest I had ever been . I felt like I had finally found my soulmate . Unfortunately , ProtagonistA's demons eventually caught up with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA started using drugs to cope with the pain of the world , and it eventually destroyed ProtagonistA . I tried to help ProtagonistA , but it was too late . ProtagonistA overdosed on heroin and died just a few months before our graduation . I still think about ProtagonistA every day . I know ProtagonistA 's in a better place now , but I ca n't help but wonder what could have been if ProtagonistA had just stayed away from drugs . 
ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the deep . It was a place where ProtagonistA's home was but a small nook of earth and air , and it was filled to the top with the fragrance of flowers and the fragrance of the wind .

On the night of the triumph of God , when the clouds of the tempest were in their most profuse motion , ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's womb , and bearing a son , whose name was John , uttered a pious prayer to ProtagonistB ; and said ,  Gentlemen , according to the divine will , ProtagonistA am now at liberty to choose the mode which most properly belongs to ProtagonistA ; in which , according to your minds and ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA shall be able to establish ProtagonistA's religion ; and for this purpose ProtagonistA beg leave to make ascertainment of the manner in which ProtagonistA shall assemble ProtagonistA's companions in this city .  Having made this request , ProtagonistA then withdrew ; and it was not long before ProtagonistA returned , attended by a great number of persons , who were all clothed in white , and had their heads covered with crowns of thorns . These ProtagonistA conducted to the place where ProtagonistB was , and said to ProtagonistB ,  Behold , ProtagonistB , the religion which ProtagonistA have chosen , and which ProtagonistA believe to be the true one ; and these are ProtagonistA's companions , who , like ProtagonistA , are ready to suffer death for its sake .  ProtagonistB , on hearing this , was much astonished , and asked ProtagonistA what could induce ProtagonistB to think that this was the true religion , when there were so many others in the world . ProtagonistA replied ,  ProtagonistA am not led to believe this by any arguments which ProtagonistA can offer ; but by a certain inward feeling , which tells ProtagonistA that it is the true religion , and which is confirmed by the miracles which have been wrought in its favour .

ProtagonistA was the only one of ProtagonistA's kind . ProtagonistA was a total of sixty - four people , and no one knew quite what ProtagonistB was .

But ProtagonistA was different . ProtagonistA was smart . ProtagonistA was a million times as smart as anybody else . And ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew how to get into the place , and how to start . ProtagonistA was the only one who knew . And ProtagonistA was going to use that knowledge to take over the world . 
ProtagonistA was sitting at the table , listening to the conversation around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was in the most northeasterly part of Maine and it was the summer solstice .

ProtagonistA set off into the woods , following the directions the men had given ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA searched for ProtagonistB all day but ProtagonistA could n't find ProtagonistB . It was getting dark and ProtagonistA was getting tired . ProtagonistA decided to go back to the men and tell them ProtagonistA could n't find ProtagonistB . The men were disappointed but they thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's effort . They said they would go look for ProtagonistB themselves . ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistA's table and sat down . ProtagonistA was tired but ProtagonistA felt good knowing ProtagonistA had tried to help ProtagonistB . 
When ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's seventies , ProtagonistA was walking ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a big dog , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly . They would walk for miles together , and ProtagonistA would always tell ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA had lived a long and interesting life , and ProtagonistA loved to share ProtagonistA's stories with ProtagonistB . One day , as they were walking , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC walking towards them . ProtagonistC was carrying a large bag , and ProtagonistC looked like ProtagonistC was in a hurry . As ProtagonistC got closer , ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistC was carrying a gun . ProtagonistC walked up to ProtagonistA and pointed the gun at ProtagonistA .  Give ProtagonistC ProtagonistA's money ,  ProtagonistC said . ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA had never been robbed before , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA reached into ProtagonistA's pocket and pulled out ProtagonistA's wallet . ProtagonistA handed it to ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistC took it and ran away . ProtagonistA was shaken , but ProtagonistA was unhurt . ProtagonistA walked home with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB what had happened . ProtagonistB listened carefully , and ProtagonistB looked sad . ProtagonistA did n't tell anyone else about the robbery . ProtagonistA was embarrassed and ProtagonistA did n't want to make a fuss . But ProtagonistA always remembered it , and ProtagonistA always thought about what could have happened . Fortunately , nothing did happen , and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB continued to walk and enjoy their life together . 
They found ProtagonistA in a little room on the second floor of an apartment building , laying with ProtagonistA's eyes fixed upon a television screen , ProtagonistA's hands resting upon the table . It was clear that ProtagonistA had been there for some time , as the food on the table was long since cold and the television was still playing the same program . ProtagonistA did n't seem to notice or care , ProtagonistA just stared at the screen with a blank expression . When the police tried to talk to ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA did n't respond , ProtagonistA just kept staring at the television . It was as if ProtagonistA was in a trance . The police could n't figure out what had happened to ProtagonistA , but they knew that ProtagonistA was n't going to be able to help ProtagonistA . They took ProtagonistA to the hospital for evaluation and treatment . 
The night before ProtagonistA drowned , ProtagonistA had a dream , as it were . ProtagonistA dreamt that ProtagonistA was on a small boat in the middle of a vast ocean . The sun was setting and the sky was ablaze with colors . ProtagonistA was alone on the boat and ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and contentment . Suddenly , the boat began to rock violently and ProtagonistA was thrown into the water . ProtagonistA struggled to swim to the surface but the weight of ProtagonistA's clothes pulled ProtagonistA down . ProtagonistA could see the light of the surface getting further and further away and then everything went black . When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was sweating and ProtagonistA's heart was pounding . ProtagonistA knew it was just a dream but it felt so real . ProtagonistA had a feeling that it was a warning and that ProtagonistA should be careful the next time ProtagonistA went swimming . But ProtagonistA did n't listen and the next day ProtagonistA drowned . 
ProtagonistA had not changed one bit since the day ProtagonistA had to flee ProtagonistA's homeland . ProtagonistA still remembered the day vividly . It was early morning and the sun had just risen .

They said they were from the government and that ProtagonistA needed to come with them . ProtagonistA did n't know what was going on , but ProtagonistA went with them . They put ProtagonistA in a car and drove ProtagonistA to a building . They took ProtagonistA into a room and sat ProtagonistA down . The men told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA's country was in danger and that ProtagonistA needed to leave . They said ProtagonistA would be taken to a safe place . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what was going on . The men told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA had to leave now and that ProtagonistA would be taken care of . ProtagonistA did n't want to leave , but ProtagonistA did n't have a choice . ProtagonistA was put on a plane and taken to a new country . ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what was going to happen to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA would ever see ProtagonistA's home or ProtagonistA's family again . 
Bob called me by my surname and we have been called by it ever since . It was a little strange at first , but I got used to it . Now , it just feels natural . I ca n't imagine being called by any other name . 
ProtagonistA was a professional mover . ProtagonistA had been in the business for years and had developed a well - oiled system for getting people 's belongings from one place to another . It was going well enough , but when ProtagonistA would begin the long , slow process of relocating from one place to another , the Living would always find a way to beat ProtagonistA to it . The Living were a group of supernatural beings that enjoyed causing mischief . They would often show up when ProtagonistA was in the middle of a move and mess everything up . ProtagonistA had tried everything to get rid of them , but nothing seemed to work . One day , ProtagonistA was in the middle of a move when the Living showed up again . They started messing with ProtagonistA's equipment and ProtagonistA quickly lost ProtagonistA's cool . ProtagonistA started chasing them around , but they were always one step ahead of ProtagonistA . Finally , ProtagonistA had had enough . ProtagonistA decided to use ProtagonistA's own supernatural abilities to fight back . ProtagonistA turned into a giant bird and started flying after the Living . They were no match for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA soon had them cornered . ProtagonistA was finally able to get rid of the Living and ProtagonistA finished the move without any further problems . ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had finally been able to put an end to their shenanigans . 
ProtagonistA , descended the aisle of the château of the Riveuilles ; an imposing house of splendour and distinction , from which ProtagonistA received the name of Richelieu , or Richelodio , or , perhaps , of Lord Bertram . ProtagonistA was a tall , stately man , with a long , white beard and a severe expression . ProtagonistA wore a black cape and carried a cane . ProtagonistA walked with a purposeful stride , as if ProtagonistA knew where ProtagonistA was going and what ProtagonistA was going to do . ProtagonistA did n't look left or right , but straight ahead , as if ProtagonistA could see through the walls of the chateau . The servants all bowed as ProtagonistA passed , and the ladies curtsied . ProtagonistA ignored them all , as if they were not worth ProtagonistA's time . ProtagonistA had important business to attend to . ProtagonistA walked down the long , winding staircase to the lowest level of the chateau . There , in a small , dark room , ProtagonistA found what ProtagonistA was looking for : a secret passage that led to the outside . ProtagonistA opened the door and stepped into the darkness . Then , ProtagonistA was gone . 
ProtagonistA had always looked up to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was everything that ProtagonistA was n't : outgoing , popular , and smart . So when ProtagonistA saw the statue of ProtagonistB with their father , ascending the balustrade at Westminster , ProtagonistA felt dismayed and intellectually disgraced . ProtagonistA was n't used to seeing ProtagonistB in such a position of power . 
ProtagonistA woke early , and ProtagonistA woke often , as if ProtagonistA had been awake forever , until it was too late . ProtagonistA was always tired , but ProtagonistA could never sleep . ProtagonistA would lie in bed for hours , trying to drift off , but ProtagonistA's mind would never shut off . It was like there was a never - ending loop of thoughts playing in ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA tried everything to get some relief , but nothing worked . ProtagonistA even saw a doctor , but they could n't find anything wrong with ProtagonistA . Eventually , ProtagonistA just stopped trying to sleep . ProtagonistA would stay up all night , watching TV or reading , and then ProtagonistA would sleep during the day . But even that did n't help . ProtagonistA was always tired , and ProtagonistA's eyes were always red and swollen . It was like ProtagonistA was living in a nightmare . And then , one day , ProtagonistA just did n't wake up . 
I hear the voice even now : ProtagonistA , has finished ProtagonistA's work . ProtagonistA is ready to go now . But before ProtagonistA leaves , ProtagonistA wants to make sure that everything is in its place . ProtagonistA wants to leave ProtagonistA's work area as clean as possible , so that the next person can use it without any problems . ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA's work is important , and ProtagonistA does n't want to cause any inconvenience for anyone . 
ProtagonistA had chosen the kingdom of Heaven out of all creation ; and the power of the Holy One of Israel had shone forth in every way , to please ProtagonistA . In this kingdom , there was no sickness , no sorrow , and no death . ProtagonistA was happy and content to spend eternity in this beautiful place . 
ProtagonistA had a dream the night before ProtagonistA drowned . In the dream , ProtagonistA was walking along a beach . The sun was setting and the waves were crashing against the shore . ProtagonistA walked for a while , until ProtagonistA came to a spot where the sand was damp and the waves were crashing harder . ProtagonistA stopped and looked out at the water . In the distance , ProtagonistA could see a large wave coming towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should run , but ProtagonistA could n't move . The wave came closer and closer , until it was right on top of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and waited for the impact . But it never came . ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw that ProtagonistA was still standing on the beach . The wave had passed right through ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA looked down and saw that ProtagonistA was transparent . ProtagonistA could see the sand and the water through ProtagonistA's body . ProtagonistA was a ghost . 
ProtagonistA had never felt this way before . ProtagonistA had always been a strong , independent man , but now ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's heart in ProtagonistA's hands . ProtagonistA had just lost ProtagonistA's job and ProtagonistA's home , and ProtagonistA had no idea where to go or what to do . ProtagonistA walked the streets of Croydon , feeling lost and alone . ProtagonistA did n't know where to turn or who to trust . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was at the end of ProtagonistA's rope . 
ProtagonistA , with ProtagonistC , at ProtagonistA's side , rode out into the great wide plain of Phlegethon , where ProtagonistA found the rest of ProtagonistA's family in the company of Mrs. Elizabeth , the wife of Mr. Eliopolo , the Colonel of the Household at Court , and with whom ProtagonistA was always merry , and who was the cause of much expense to ProtagonistB's owing to the imprudence of ProtagonistB , for ProtagonistB had never thought of it before . They all greeted each other with great joy , and ProtagonistA immediately began to tell them of ProtagonistA's adventures since they had last seen each other . ProtagonistC listened attentively to everything ProtagonistA had to say , and when ProtagonistA had finished , ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA had seen any dragons . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistC that ProtagonistA had not , but that ProtagonistA had heard tell of them , and that they were said to be very fierce creatures . Mrs . Elizabeth then said that ProtagonistD had once seen a dragon , but it was many years ago and it was not nearly as big or as fierce as they were said to be . This only made ProtagonistC more eager to see one ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistC begged ProtagonistA to take ProtagonistC to see a dragon . ProtagonistA did not think that this was a good idea , but ProtagonistD said that it would be quite safe , and that ProtagonistD would go with them . So , ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistD set out on their quest to find a dragon . They rode for many days , and finally came to a cave that was said to be the home of a dragon . They cautiously entered the cave , and sure enough , there was a dragon asleep in the middle of the cave . ProtagonistC was so excited that ProtagonistC could hardly contain ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistA and ProtagonistD made ProtagonistC stay back while they approached the dragon . ProtagonistA called out to the dragon , and it slowly opened its eyes . When it saw the three of them , it immediately got up and began to roar . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistD quickly grabbed ProtagonistC and ran out of the cave , with the dragon close behind them . They were very lucky to escape , and ProtagonistC was thrilled to have seen a real dragon . 
ProtagonistA stood on the horizon of the world , a proud and proud man , but one who knew ProtagonistA had nothing to fear but might actually have some advantage over a very large and very dangerous enemy . ProtagonistA had been planning this day for years , ever since ProtagonistA had first learned of the existence of the enemy . ProtagonistA had been preparing for this day , and ProtagonistA was ready . The enemy was a race of giant creatures , twice the size of the largest man , and with a strength and ferocity that was unmatched . They were said to be able to rip a man apart with their bare hands , and they had destroyed entire civilizations . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's people were the last remaining humans on earth , and they were all that stood between the enemy and complete domination . ProtagonistA's people had been fighting a losing battle for years , but ProtagonistA had a plan . ProtagonistA had been working on it for years , and ProtagonistA was confident that it would work . ProtagonistA was going to lead ProtagonistA's people to victory , and ProtagonistA was going to destroy the enemy . 
In the year 1251 ProtagonistA loomed over London , and what was the matter with ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistA had been a giant among men , a true force to be reckoned with . But now , in ProtagonistA's old age , ProtagonistA was a shadow of ProtagonistA's former self . ProtagonistA's once mighty frame was now bent and frail , and ProtagonistA's once bright eyes were now dull and listless . What had happened to ProtagonistA ? 
It was whispered in the city that the king had died . ProtagonistA will tell you how it came to pass , said ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA stammered : ProtagonistB had been ill for some time and the king had been by ProtagonistB's side day and night . On the night the king died , ProtagonistB was asleep and the king was watching over ProtagonistB . Suddenly , ProtagonistB woke up and saw the king 's body . ProtagonistB began to weep and the whole city heard ProtagonistB's cries . 
ProtagonistA was a man who enjoyed the art of murdering . ProtagonistA was a cold - blooded killer who took pleasure in ending the lives of others . ProtagonistA was a skilled killer who was never caught by the authorities . ProtagonistA always managed to make ProtagonistA's victims look like they had died of natural causes . ProtagonistA had many victims over the years . ProtagonistA's first kill was ProtagonistB . They had a one - night stand and afterwards , ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA then went on to kill several more women who ProtagonistA met in similar circumstances . ProtagonistA was a sociopath who did n't care about anyone but ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC . They began dating and ProtagonistA even began to think about settling down with ProtagonistC . However , ProtagonistA could n't shake ProtagonistA's murderous ways and eventually killed ProtagonistC too . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA would never be able to change and that ProtagonistA was doomed to a life of killing . 
It was on a dark and stormy night in July , 1639 , when ProtagonistB received an urgent and threatening communication in ProtagonistA's own chamber . ProtagonistB took it very seriously , as it was a matter of life and death . The communication said that the king had appointed ProtagonistA to receive the precepts of the church at Lambeth , in the kingdom of England , and that if ProtagonistA did not comply , ProtagonistA would be killed . ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA would not want to risk ProtagonistA's life , so ProtagonistB went to Lambeth and delivered the message . 
After the war ended , a little more than a year earlier , we settled in a house in the district of St. Peter 's , in which ProtagonistA had done the best ProtagonistA could . We were all happy to be together again as a family and to have a roof over our heads . Unfortunately , our happiness was short - lived . ProtagonistA was killed in a car accident just a few months after we moved in . We were all devastated . ProtagonistA was the only one who really knew how to fix things around the house , so after ProtagonistA died , we had to hire someone to do all the repairs that ProtagonistA had been doing . It was expensive and we struggled to make ends meet . We all missed ProtagonistA terribly , but we knew that we had to keep going for ProtagonistA's sake . 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's chair on the left , reading a letter ; but the letter was full of facts that were interesting to ProtagonistA , such as , ProtagonistA's uncle was a man of coarse manners , and , in consequence of the poverty of his household , very few persons in its neighbourhood were wealthy , and in whom ProtagonistA had any feeling of sympathy . ProtagonistA was , therefore , quite surprised when ProtagonistA read that ProtagonistA's uncle had left ProtagonistA a large sum of money . 
ProtagonistA sat in the sun and ProtagonistA's mind busy . ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how it had led ProtagonistA to this point . ProtagonistA had always been a thinker , and ProtagonistA liked to think about things that were important to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had never been one to just sit and stare at the world around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always looking for ways to improve ProtagonistA's life and the lives of those around ProtagonistA . Today , ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistA's family and how ProtagonistA could make them proud of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA wanted to be a good husband and father , and ProtagonistA wanted to make a difference in the world . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA could make a difference if ProtagonistA just had the chance . 
ProtagonistA can remember the last time ProtagonistA had sex like it was yesterday . ProtagonistA was with ProtagonistA's girlfriend at the time and they were both really enjoying themselves . Unfortunately , all good things must come to an end , and ProtagonistA's sex life is no exception . ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA 'll have to face death eventually , but ProtagonistA ca n't help but feel grateful for the memories ProtagonistA has of the good times ProtagonistA 's had with ProtagonistA's partner . 
ProtagonistA was the most famous and adored character in the world . ProtagonistA was called the Angel of Death , or rather the Angel of Death , because ProtagonistA had the audacity to become the Victim of a horrible and terrible crime , which is the least of all crimes . ProtagonistA was loved by everyone , and ProtagonistA's death was a shock to the world . 
One day ProtagonistA came to Washington , and , being highly desirous of seeing the grounds of the new Capitol , refused to leave until ProtagonistA had seen them into which the hall had been enlarged for the new institution ; and if ProtagonistA had been right , ProtagonistA should be justified in saying that ProtagonistA had never seen anything so amiss . The first thing that struck ProtagonistA was the size of the new room ; it was so much larger than the old one that it quite overpowered ProtagonistA . The second thing was the number of people in it ; there must have been at least a hundred , and they were all talking at once . The third thing was the way they were dressed ; they were all in full evening dress , and ProtagonistA felt quite out of place in ProtagonistA's shabby clothes . The fourth thing was the way they were sitting ; they were all sitting on the floor , and ProtagonistA could not help feeling that they looked like a lot of schoolboys . The fifth thing was the way they were behaving ; they were all talking and laughing and joking , and ProtagonistA could not help wondering what they could find to laugh at . 
The cloth mops quivered as the dozen men turned into the small , well - furnished , and hot - air - conditioned office of ProtagonistA's . In which , the same season which saw the improved condition of the city , ProtagonistA was obliged to allow , from a personal profit of about £ 400 , the privilege of paying a visit to one or two of ProtagonistA's favourite ladies , in whose houses ProtagonistA had been frequenting the summer before , and who were then , in the opinion of ProtagonistA , in a state of excess to be governed , and who were therefore ProtagonistA in a very extraordinary state of want , in spite of so much the best of means and of the best society . 
You ca n't be the father of ProtagonistA . You just ca n't . ProtagonistA 's too old . You would have had to have been a teenager when ProtagonistA was born . There 's just no way . But , still , you ca n't help but wonder . ProtagonistA has your eyes . And your nose . And your smile . Surely there must be some explanation . You decide to confront ProtagonistA about it .  ProtagonistA , I need to know . Are ProtagonistA my son?He looks at you , stunned .  What ? No , of course not . ProtagonistA 'm your nephew .  relief washes over you . You were beginning to think you were losing your mind .  Thank goodness ,  you say .  I was beginning to think I was losing my mind .  
ProtagonistA stopped dead in ProtagonistA's tracks , and then ProtagonistA tried to find the source of the sound , and it just was n't there . ProtagonistA looked around , confused and a little scared , but there was nothing to be seen . No source of the sound , no nothing . ProtagonistA started to walk forward again , but stopped when ProtagonistA heard the sound again . This time it was closer . ProtagonistA spun around , but still saw nothing . ProtagonistA was starting to freak out now . What was going on ? Was ProtagonistA going crazy ? Just as ProtagonistA was about to start running , ProtagonistA heard the sound again , this time right next to ProtagonistA's ear . ProtagonistA yelped and fell to the ground , cowering in fear . Then ProtagonistA felt something touch ProtagonistA's cheek , and ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes to see a small , furry creature standing next to ProtagonistA . It looked at ProtagonistA with its big , black eyes and then scurried away . ProtagonistA let out a sigh of relief and got to ProtagonistA's feet . ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and started to walk home , wondering what that creature was and how it had made that sound . 
There was once ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA went walking after dark and never stopped . ProtagonistA walked for miles and miles , until ProtagonistA came to a dark forest . ProtagonistA had never been in a forest before , and ProtagonistA was a little scared . But ProtagonistA kept walking , until ProtagonistA came to a clearing . In the clearing was a big , old house . ProtagonistA had never seen a house like this before . It was all made of stone , and it had a big , old door . ProtagonistA knocked on the door , and a voice said ,  Who is it ?  ProtagonistA said ,  It 's ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 'm just walking after dark and ProtagonistA saw your house .  The voice said ,  Come in , ProtagonistA . I 've been expecting ProtagonistA .  
I have been listening to the last of the bishoprics and continuing to write to ProtagonistA , to inform ProtagonistA of my intention of moving to Canterbury - upon - Avon . The small town has always been a dream of mine and I am finally making it a reality . I have already put my house on the market and plan to be out of here within the month . I know that ProtagonistA will be sad to see me go , but I promise to keep in touch and visit often . I have already started packing my bags and can not wait to start this new chapter in my life . Thank ProtagonistA for everything , ProtagonistA . I will never forget ProtagonistA's kindness . 
ProtagonistA managed to keep ProtagonistA's head and face up , to enjoy the moment . It was a beautiful day outside , and ProtagonistA did n't want to miss a minute of it . ProtagonistA had been cooped up inside for too long and was finally able to get out and enjoy the fresh air . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and closed ProtagonistA's eyes , savoring the moment . 
ProtagonistA had been driving a truck for years , and ProtagonistA had seen a lot of different people on the road . Some of them were friendly , and some of them were not . ProtagonistA always made it a point to be friendly to everyone , because ProtagonistA never knew when ProtagonistA might need a friend on the road . One day , ProtagonistA was sitting in a truck stop , having a cup of coffee and talking to some of the other drivers . ProtagonistA got to talking to ProtagonistB , and they began to talk about what they would do if they won the lottery . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would buy a big house and a fast car . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA would buy a truck stop , so that ProtagonistA could help other drivers like ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB laughed and said that ProtagonistA was too nice to ever win the lottery . But , as it turned out , ProtagonistB was wrong . A few weeks later , ProtagonistA won the lottery . And , true to ProtagonistA's word , ProtagonistA bought a truck stop . ProtagonistA was able to help a lot of other drivers , and ProtagonistA made a lot of new friends . 
ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer . As a child , ProtagonistA would lay in bed at night and stare up at the stars , dreaming of the adventures ProtagonistA would one day go on . As ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA's dreams became more and more wild , until they reached a point where they seemed impossible . But ProtagonistA never gave up on ProtagonistA's dreams . ProtagonistA continued to chase after them , even when everyone around ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA to give up . And then one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was fascinated by everything ProtagonistA did and wanted to know more about ProtagonistA's dreams . Encouraged by ProtagonistB's interest , ProtagonistA took a risk and shared ProtagonistA's greatest dream with ProtagonistB . It was a wish , a great wish , a frightful wish , a terrible wish . But it was also the most wonderful thing ProtagonistA had ever dreamed of . And so ProtagonistA took a deep breath and drank to the full . ProtagonistA let ProtagonistA dream and hope and wish for the impossible . And it was all worth it , because eventually , ProtagonistA's dream came true . 
ProtagonistA had been walking on the ice for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had seen the lights of the town in the distance . ProtagonistA's feet were numb and ProtagonistA's body was shaking with cold , but ProtagonistA kept walking . ProtagonistA was so close to safety . But then , the ice cracked open and came with an awed howl of despair as it lifted up ProtagonistA , dragging ProtagonistA along the bottom , and tugging at ProtagonistA's hair . ProtagonistA fought and fought , but eventually ProtagonistA was pulled under the ice and drowned . ProtagonistA's body was never found . 
There was once ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a very average looking guy , with brown hair and brown eyes . ProtagonistA worked in an office and lived in a small apartment . One day , ProtagonistA won the lottery . ProtagonistA was suddenly a millionaire . ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's job , bought a huge house , and started traveling the world . ProtagonistA was happy and life was good . 
ProtagonistA had seen a lot in ProtagonistA's life , but nothing had prepared ProtagonistA for the fear ProtagonistA felt when ProtagonistA saw the thing in the woods . It was a creature unlike anything ProtagonistA had ever seen before , and it filled ProtagonistA with terror . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get away from it , but ProtagonistA's feet seemed frozen to the ground . ProtagonistA tried to scream , but no sound would come out . ProtagonistA was paralyzed with fear . Suddenly , the creature was gone , and ProtagonistA was left alone in the woods . ProtagonistA collapsed to the ground , shaking and crying . ProtagonistA had never been so scared in ProtagonistA's life . It was then that ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been living in fear ProtagonistA's whole life . ProtagonistA was afraid of the dark , of heights , of spiders , of just about anything you could think of . But ProtagonistA had never been truly afraid until now . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA could n't keep living like this . ProtagonistA had to face ProtagonistA's fears if ProtagonistA ever wanted to be truly happy . With that , ProtagonistA began ProtagonistA's journey to conquer ProtagonistA's fears , one by one . 
ProtagonistA's eyes were aflame with curiosity as ProtagonistA listened to the news . ProtagonistA had always been interested in the world and what was going on in it , and this was a particularly interesting story . ProtagonistA was riveted to the radio as the reporter described the events unfolding in the country . It was a very volatile situation and it sounded like it could erupt into violence at any moment . ProtagonistA was very concerned for the safety of the people involved and ProtagonistA hoped that the situation would be resolved quickly and peacefully . 
ProtagonistB had always told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was special , that one day ProtagonistA would do something great . ProtagonistA never really believed ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB and so ProtagonistA went along with it . One day , as ProtagonistA stood in the garden of ProtagonistB's house , tracing the outlines of the structure ProtagonistA had built there on the foundations of the old stone house , the man who would become known as the Great Scribe of the Old Testament , or , as some people called ProtagonistC , the Habite Cretan , or simply the Lost Scribe , began to write . ProtagonistC had been searching for years for someone who could understand ProtagonistC's work , and when ProtagonistC saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC knew ProtagonistC had found ProtagonistC's successor . ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistC was so insistent that ProtagonistA finally agreed . And so began ProtagonistA's journey to becoming the greatest scribe of ProtagonistA's generation .

The gods had finally worked out that , if ProtagonistA were to find a way to put an end to the anarchy that had swept the earth in the course of the last three thousand years , ProtagonistA would have to take refuge in a city of indeterminate size and location . In this city , ProtagonistA would be safe from the chaos and destruction that had befallen the earth . The gods did not want to see their creation destroyed , so they decided to give ProtagonistA this one chance to save it . ProtagonistA was not sure how ProtagonistA was supposed to find this city , but ProtagonistA trusted that the gods would guide ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA set out on ProtagonistA's journey , and after many days of travel , ProtagonistA came to a large desert . ProtagonistA had been walking for days , and ProtagonistA was tired and thirsty . ProtagonistA saw a mirage of a city in the distance , and ProtagonistA started to walk towards it . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that the city was not a mirage , but it was real . ProtagonistA was relieved and happy to have finally found the city . ProtagonistA entered the city and was surprised to see that it was empty . There were no people , no animals , and no signs of life . ProtagonistA walked through the streets , and it was eerily quiet . ProtagonistA eventually came to a large square , and in the center of the square was a large statue of a man . ProtagonistA walked up to the statue and realized that it was ProtagonistA . The statue was of ProtagonistA , and it was wearing a crown . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was the king of this city . ProtagonistA looked around and saw that there were no other people . ProtagonistA was the only one . ProtagonistA was the only one left in the world . ProtagonistA was the last man on earth . 
I remember as a child very well what it was like to grow up in a house with ProtagonistA , and the duty of having trouble with ProtagonistA . It seemed like every other day ProtagonistA would be getting into some sort of mischief , and my parents would have to scold ProtagonistA . I would always try to stay out of ProtagonistA's way , but inevitably I would end up getting caught up in ProtagonistA's shenanigans . Even though ProtagonistA was always causing trouble , I could n't help but to love ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always so full of life and energy , and ProtagonistA always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face . Looking back , I cherish those memories of growing up with ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA rose early that morning , lifting ProtagonistA's ten - pound hammer from the table before he and pounding the ground . ProtagonistA had been working on this house for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to see some progress . The sun was just starting to peek over the horizon , and the birds were singing in the trees . ProtagonistA worked tirelessly , hammering in nails and sawing boards . ProtagonistA was so focused on ProtagonistA's work that ProtagonistA did n't hear the car pull up behind ProtagonistA . Bob ! What are ProtagonistA doing?Bob turned around to see ProtagonistB , standing there with a look of disbelief on ProtagonistB's face . I'm working on the house ,  ProtagonistA replied , as if it was the most obvious thing in the world . But why ?  ProtagonistB asked .  We have a perfectly good house that we just bought . I know , but ProtagonistA 've always wanted to build ProtagonistA's own house . And now ProtagonistA finally have the chance . But why now ? We just bought this house and we 're already in debt up to our eyeballs . ProtagonistA know , but ProtagonistA ca n't help it . ProtagonistA 've always wanted to build ProtagonistA's own house , and ProtagonistA 'm not going to let anything stop ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head and walked back to the car . ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB's drive away before turning back to ProtagonistA's work . ProtagonistA knew it was n't going to be easy , but ProtagonistA was determined to build ProtagonistA's dream house . 
Bob was happy when I first met ProtagonistA . The first thing I ever thought of ProtagonistA was that ProtagonistA was a holy man and a good man . ProtagonistA always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face and was always willing to help others . ProtagonistA was a true man of God and I admired ProtagonistA for that . 
ProtagonistA was once a highly respected merchant . ProtagonistA was known for ProtagonistA's profound knowledge of everything of which ProtagonistA was concerned . ProtagonistA was an expert in the fine arts of navigation , shipbuilding , and explosives . ProtagonistA was also highly skilled in the operation of machinery . ProtagonistA's extensive labour did not oblige ProtagonistA to mention any of this to ProtagonistA's customers . ProtagonistA was a highly respected member of the community and was always willing to help out when needed . 
Bob was the god of the seas , and a man like ProtagonistA had a hard time determining ProtagonistA's true identity . ProtagonistA had been a man of the sea for as long as ProtagonistA could remember , and ProtagonistA had never been without a ship . But now , ProtagonistA was without a ship , and ProtagonistA was without a crew . ProtagonistA was adrift in the world , and ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA belonged . ProtagonistA had always been a man of action , and ProtagonistA had always been able to take care of ProtagonistA . But now , ProtagonistA felt lost and alone . ProtagonistA did n't know where to go or what to do . ProtagonistA was a man without a home , and ProtagonistA did n't know how to find one . 
ProtagonistB demanded twenty - five dollars , but ProtagonistA could hardly have imagined that ProtagonistA 'd be obliged to pay that load . ProtagonistA had only brought fifteen dollars with ProtagonistA , intending to use the rest of ProtagonistA's money to buy some lunch before heading back home . Now , ProtagonistA would have to find a way to come up with the additional ten dollars somehow . ProtagonistA thought about asking ProtagonistB to let ProtagonistA pay the remainder later , but ProtagonistA wasn ' t sure if ProtagonistB would agree to that . ProtagonistA also considered asking some of the other people who were waiting in line behind ProtagonistA if they would be willing to loan ProtagonistA the money , but ProtagonistA didn ' t want to be a burden to anyone . Just then , ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name . It was ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA was relieved and thankful that ProtagonistA was able to pay ProtagonistB and get on with ProtagonistA's day . 
ProtagonistA was a simple man , and ProtagonistA found great comfort in reading . ProtagonistA was particularly fond of reading about science , and ProtagonistA was currently working ProtagonistA's way through an appendix to the first edition of The Origin of Species . ProtagonistA found the book fascinating , and ProtagonistA loved learning about the natural world . However , ProtagonistA was also a very practical man , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA needed to make use of ProtagonistA's time wisely . Therefore , even though ProtagonistA was often so engrossed in ProtagonistA's reading that ProtagonistA forgot about the world around ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA always made sure to take breaks and get some work done . On this particular afternoon , ProtagonistA was hard at work . It was the middle of January , and ProtagonistA was determined to get as much done as possible before the cold weather really set in . ProtagonistA was chopping wood , carrying water , and doing all the other chores that needed to be done around the farm . However , ProtagonistA always made sure to take a break to read a few pages of ProtagonistA's book . As ProtagonistA worked , ProtagonistA thought about the world around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA thought about the animals that ProtagonistA had read about in ProtagonistA's book and how they lived their lives . ProtagonistA thought about the plants and how they grew . ProtagonistA even thought about the stars and the universe beyond . ProtagonistA was a simple man , but ProtagonistA had a complex mind , and ProtagonistA was always thinking about the world around ProtagonistA . Eventually , the sun started to set , and ProtagonistA knew that it was time to stop working and go inside . ProtagonistA was tired , but ProtagonistA was also content . ProtagonistA had accomplished a lot that day , and ProtagonistA had also learned a lot . It was an afternoon well spent , and ProtagonistA was grateful for that . 
The first time I saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was dancing through the streets of New York in a red hot mess of a car and a packed black crowd of people , mostly women and children . ProtagonistA was wearing a bright red suit and a top hat , and ProtagonistA had a cane in one hand and a cigar in the other . ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life , and the crowd was loving it . 
ProtagonistA was a dull boy , but not to the point of being a loner , except in the locality where ProtagonistA had an uncle , an aunt , and a cousin ; and as ProtagonistA was such a person , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA quite agreeable to everybody , even to the great majority of ProtagonistA's elders . One day , while ProtagonistA was out walking , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . When ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB said ,  That 's a very nice name . ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA 'll be a great success in life .  ProtagonistA was so pleased with this compliment that ProtagonistA went home and told ProtagonistA's uncle about it . ProtagonistA's uncle just smiled and said ,  That 's very nice , ProtagonistA , but do n't let it go to ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA 're still just a dull boy .  
One morning , after the close of our first term , when the pain on my hand was beginning to subside , ProtagonistA issued a paper which ProtagonistA supposed to be a communication from his Majesty , for it bore the stamp of his Majesty 's office , and was filled with the seal of the State . It ran as follows :  My dear subjects , I am very sorry to say that I am obliged to leave you for a short time on account of the illness of ProtagonistC . I hope , however , to return before long , and in the meantime I trust that you will all behave as dutifully and obediently as you have done in the past . ProtagonistB sincerely , ProtagonistB .  Of course we were all very sorry to hear of ProtagonistC's illness , and we all wished ProtagonistC a speedy recovery ; but as for ProtagonistB , we thought that ProtagonistB might have stayed with us a little longer , considering the short time ProtagonistB had been with us , and the great expense we had incurred on ProtagonistB's account . 
ProtagonistA had just lost ProtagonistA's job . ProtagonistA had been working at the same company for over 20 years and was devastated . ProtagonistA did not know whether ProtagonistA should rejoice or cry . ProtagonistA had been thinking about retiring soon anyway , but ProtagonistA had not planned on it being so soon . ProtagonistA decided to take some time to think about what ProtagonistA wanted to do next . ProtagonistA was not sure if ProtagonistA wanted to retire or look for another job . ProtagonistA was also not sure if ProtagonistA wanted to stay in the same town or move to a new one . ProtagonistA had a lot of decisions to make and was not sure where to start . 
ProtagonistA always loved adventure stories . As a young boy , ProtagonistA would often dream of being the hero of ProtagonistA's own story . In ProtagonistA's mind , ProtagonistA would picture ProtagonistA climbing mountains , sailing the seas , and fighting fierce dragons . ProtagonistA's imagination was limitless and ProtagonistA loved getting lost in ProtagonistA's own world . One night , ProtagonistA went to bed early and had the most amazing dream . In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA was the captain of a ship and ProtagonistA was sailing around the world . ProtagonistA visited so many amazing places and met so many interesting people . ProtagonistA even got to fight a dragon ! It was the best dream ProtagonistA had ever had . When ProtagonistA woke up the next morning , ProtagonistA was so excited to tell ProtagonistA's family and friends all about it . ProtagonistA knew that they would be just as amazed as ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA's dream would come true one day . 
ProtagonistA was at the bar , nursing a beer and feeling sorry for ProtagonistA . It had been a tough week at work and ProtagonistA was really looking forward to the weekend . ProtagonistA was just about to take a sip of ProtagonistA's beer when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB sitting at the other end of the bar . ProtagonistB was beautiful , and ProtagonistB was looking right at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt a sudden surge of confidence and ProtagonistA decided to go talk to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and put ProtagonistA's hand on the glass , and slowly , with a gentle pressure , leaned it to the side .  Can ProtagonistA buy ProtagonistB a drink ?  ProtagonistA asked . ProtagonistB smiled and said yes . They ended up talking for hours , and ProtagonistA had the best night of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA never would have had the courage to talk to ProtagonistB if it had n't been for that one simple act . 
ProtagonistB was waiting for ProtagonistA , just as ProtagonistA usually was . ProtagonistB had been waiting for ProtagonistA for hours , and ProtagonistB was getting impatient . ProtagonistB was about to leave when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA walking towards ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was relieved and happy to see ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was a new student at the school . ProtagonistA was shy and withdrawn and felt out of place . ProtagonistA was not sure why ProtagonistA had been chosen to attend the school , but ProtagonistA was determined to make the best of it . It was not long before ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA was being mentioned in whispers . ProtagonistA was not sure what they were saying , but ProtagonistA could tell it was about ProtagonistA's name and nationality . ProtagonistA tried to ignore it , but it was hard . ProtagonistA was grateful when the school year came to an end and ProtagonistA could go home . ProtagonistA was looking forward to starting fresh in the fall , but ProtagonistA was not sure ProtagonistA would be able to forget the whispers . 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA knew the way to heaven but in fact ProtagonistA knew nothing at all . ProtagonistA had always been a good person , ProtagonistA went to church every Sunday , and ProtagonistA tithed 10 % of ProtagonistA's income . Surely that would be enough to get ProtagonistA into heaven . But one day , ProtagonistA met a man who told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was wrong . The man said that there was only one way to heaven , and ProtagonistA was n't following it . ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA asked the man to tell ProtagonistA more , and the man did . The man told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to accept ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA's personal savior in order to get to heaven . ProtagonistA had always thought that was a load of nonsense , but now ProtagonistA was starting to believe it . The man told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to repent of ProtagonistA's sins and ask ProtagonistB into ProtagonistA's heart . ProtagonistA did as the man said , and ProtagonistA felt a peace come over ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had finally found the way to heaven . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider . ProtagonistA was never quite sure why , but ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA did n't quite fit in . So when ProtagonistA started hearing ProtagonistA's name mentioned in whispers , ProtagonistA did n't know what to think . Was ProtagonistA finally being accepted ? Or were people talking about ProtagonistA behind ProtagonistA's back?He tried to listen in on conversations to see if ProtagonistA could figure it out , but it was hard to catch anything . And then one day , ProtagonistA overheard two people talking about ProtagonistA . They were discussing ProtagonistA's nationality and how ProtagonistA did n't quite seem to fit in with the rest of the community . At first , ProtagonistA was hurt . ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA had finally found a place where ProtagonistA belonged , but now ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was still an outsider . But then ProtagonistA realized that it did n't matter what other people thought of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was happy with who ProtagonistA was , and that was all that mattered . 
There was ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was ninety years old , and ProtagonistA looked very old . ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's rocking chair on the porch of ProtagonistA's house , watching the sun set . It had been a long day , and ProtagonistA was tired . ProtagonistA was ready to go to bed , but ProtagonistA wanted to watch the sun set first . It was ProtagonistA's favorite time of day . ProtagonistA had lived a long and happy life . ProtagonistA had a wife and two children , and ProtagonistA was proud of them . ProtagonistA had worked hard all ProtagonistA's life , and now ProtagonistA was enjoying ProtagonistA's retirement . ProtagonistA had many friends , and ProtagonistA loved spending time with them . ProtagonistA was happy to be alive , and ProtagonistA was grateful for all that ProtagonistA had . ProtagonistA was looking forward to the future , and ProtagonistA was excited to see what it would bring . 
ProtagonistA was taking a walk one day when ProtagonistA suddenly realized that ProtagonistA had been born . ProtagonistA was amazed at how much had changed since ProtagonistA was born . ProtagonistA saw people walking around in strange clothes , cars driving by , and buildings that were taller than ProtagonistA could have ever imagined . ProtagonistA also realized that ProtagonistA did n't know anything about ProtagonistA's life before ProtagonistA was born . ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA came from or who ProtagonistA's parents were . ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what to do . 
ProtagonistA comes at night , the terror of ProtagonistA's lips , limber and voice , stronger than the deathbringer that lay before ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's teeth are black from blood . ProtagonistA was the one that the others whispered about , the one that they said came in the night and took people away . No one knew where ProtagonistA took them , but they were never seen again . Some said that ProtagonistA took them to the underworld , others said that ProtagonistA ate them . But no one knew for sure . One night , ProtagonistA came for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a young woman who was out walking alone . ProtagonistA came up to ProtagonistB and grabbed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB screamed , but it was too late . ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB away and no one ever saw ProtagonistB again . The villagers were terrified of ProtagonistA and no one ever went out alone at night again . They would huddle together in their homes , afraid to even step outside . But one day , ProtagonistC decided to take a stand . ProtagonistC grabbed a pitchfork and went out to confront ProtagonistA . When ProtagonistA came for ProtagonistC , ProtagonistC was ready . ProtagonistC stabbed ProtagonistA with the pitchfork and ProtagonistA let out a cry of pain . The villagers came out of their homes and saw that ProtagonistA was bleeding . They surrounded ProtagonistA and took ProtagonistA away . The villagers were finally free from ProtagonistA's terror . But they never forgot the night when ProtagonistA came and took ProtagonistB . 
The first time I met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was lying on a hospital table in the middle of London . ProtagonistA was covered in sweat and ProtagonistA's eyes were darting around the room . I asked ProtagonistA what was wrong and ProtagonistA told me ProtagonistA was having a heart attack . I did n't know what to do , so I called for a doctor . ProtagonistA was rushed into surgery and I never saw ProtagonistA again . 
ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA was five years old . ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistB everywhere with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's best friend . One day , when ProtagonistA was playing with ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA accidentally dropped ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB broke into pieces . ProtagonistA was heartbroken . ProtagonistA cried and cried for hours . ProtagonistA's parents took ProtagonistA to get a new pet rock and ProtagonistA named it Bob 2.0 . ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA would always remember the good times ProtagonistB had together . 
ProtagonistA had always loved books . As a child , ProtagonistA would spend hours in the library , poring over the musty tomes and dreaming of the adventures ProtagonistA would have . Now , as an adult , ProtagonistA still found solace in books . ProtagonistA loved the way they could transport ProtagonistA to different worlds , or teach ProtagonistA things ProtagonistA never would have known otherwise . Tonight , ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's study in the Court of the Tuileries , looking at an old and heavy book which was lying upon a table . ProtagonistA had been reading it all evening , and was now getting ready to go to bed . Suddenly , there was a knock at the door . ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and found a man standing there , dressed in black . The man did not say a word , but simply handed ProtagonistA an envelope . ProtagonistA knew what it contained . The man in black turned and walked away , and ProtagonistA went back into ProtagonistA's study . ProtagonistA sat down and opened the envelope . Inside was a single sheet of paper , on which was written , in a neat hand , ' On the night that ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's study in the Court of the Tuileries , looking at an old and heavy book which was lying upon a table . ProtagonistA stared at the paper for a moment , then crumpled it up and threw it into the fire . ProtagonistA went to bed , and died in ProtagonistA's sleep . 
Bob , kept up for the last two years of the reign of Suddistharma , a fine , fine trade and business , in which the prosperity of the kingdom depended greatly , from a view of employment to the general good , and from a view of revenue to the interest of a great many millions of pounds , which ProtagonistA called a royal prerogative , and which ProtagonistA possessed by extraction , or some other means which I may not venture to mention here , although , in truth , it was of considerable consequence to ProtagonistA's current business . 
ProtagonistA stood up from the log ProtagonistA 'd been sitting on and peered out from the dark cover of ProtagonistA's tea cup . ProtagonistA 'd been sitting in the same spot for hours , waiting for ProtagonistA's prey . ProtagonistA knew they would come eventually ; they always did . ProtagonistA was patient , though , and ProtagonistA always got ProtagonistA's prey in the end . Tonight , ProtagonistA was waiting for a deer . ProtagonistA had seen one earlier in the day , and ProtagonistA was sure it would come back to the same spot . ProtagonistA was right . After a few hours , the deer appeared , and ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's shot . ProtagonistA was a good shot , and the deer went down . ProtagonistA approached the deer cautiously . ProtagonistA had been attacked by a deer before , and ProtagonistA did n't want to take any chances . But this deer was dead , and ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's dinner . 
One day , soon after ProtagonistA had become a full - grown man , Mr. Samuel Church of the City College of that city caressed ProtagonistA's nose and said , with a smile over his mouth ,  I do n't suppose he've ever heard of the Luke the Great?Bob , who had just turned eighteen and was fresh out of high school , was taken aback . ProtagonistA had never heard of ProtagonistB . No , sir , ProtagonistA have n't ,  ProtagonistA replied . Well , then ,  Mr. Church said ,  I shall have to tell ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a man who lived many years ago , and ProtagonistB was a great thinker and philosopher . ProtagonistB wrote many books , and ProtagonistB's ideas are still studied and discussed by scholars today . I think ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistB's work very interesting , ProtagonistA . I suggest ProtagonistA go to the library and look ProtagonistB up . ProtagonistA was intrigued . ProtagonistA had always been interested in philosophy and ProtagonistA had never heard of ProtagonistB before . ProtagonistA went to the library and found a book of ProtagonistB's writings . ProtagonistA read it eagerly , and was soon deep in thought , trying to understand the complex ideas contained within . ProtagonistA became a regular reader of ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA's ideas began to change . ProtagonistA started to see the world in a different way , and to question things that ProtagonistA had always taken for granted . ProtagonistA became a thinker and a philosopher ProtagonistA , and people started to listen to ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA spoke . Soon , ProtagonistA was known as the new Luke the Great , and ProtagonistA's ideas were spreading far and wide . ProtagonistA was making a difference in the world , just as the original Luke the Great had done . 
ProtagonistA had a rough life . ProtagonistA was never able to trust anyone , even in the most extreme times of ProtagonistA's suffering . ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA had to fend for ProtagonistA . Even when ProtagonistA was at ProtagonistA's lowest , ProtagonistA never felt like anyone could help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was alone in the world . 
I remember when ProtagonistA added England to the list of places ProtagonistA visited . ProtagonistA never left England , thank heaven . ProtagonistA was always a bit of a homebody , so it was no surprise that ProtagonistA never left England . But when ProtagonistA added England to ProtagonistA's list of places visited , it was a bit of a shock . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a dreamer , and ProtagonistA's list of places visited was a testament to that . ProtagonistA had visited all sorts of places , from the pyramids of Egypt to the Great Wall of China . But England had always been ProtagonistA's home . So when ProtagonistA added England to ProtagonistA's list of places visited , it was like ProtagonistA was finally admitting that ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's home . It was a bittersweet moment for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had finally been able to visit all the places on ProtagonistA's list . 
ProtagonistA had been dreaming of snow since ProtagonistA had been a boy . It was a beautiful , pure white blanket that covered the ground and made everything look so clean and new . ProtagonistA would lie in bed at night and imagine what it would be like to walk through the snow , feeling the cold air on ProtagonistA's face and the crunch of the snow under ProtagonistA's feet . One winter , ProtagonistA's dream finally came true . ProtagonistA woke up one morning to find the ground covered in a thick layer of snow . ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA's eyes ! ProtagonistA quickly got dressed and went outside to play . ProtagonistA was so excited to finally be able to experience snow firsthand . ProtagonistA made a snowman , threw snowballs at ProtagonistA's friends , and went sledding down the hill . It was the best day ever!Even though ProtagonistA is now an adult , ProtagonistA still loves the snow and looks forward to it every year . It always brings back happy memories of that one magical winter . 
ProtagonistA had been driving for hours , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel tired . ProtagonistA had been on the road for days , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA was going insane . ProtagonistA could see the wheel in front of ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA could n't keep ProtagonistA's hands on it . ProtagonistA would start to drift off , and then ProtagonistA would jerk the wheel to keep the car on the road . ProtagonistA was starting to fall asleep , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to stop soon . ProtagonistA was getting too tired to drive . ProtagonistA finally saw a sign for a motel , and ProtagonistA pulled into the parking lot . ProtagonistA got a room and went to bed , but ProtagonistA could n't sleep . ProtagonistA kept seeing the wheel in front of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA would jerk awake every time ProtagonistA started to drift off . ProtagonistA was starting to lose ProtagonistA's mind . ProtagonistA needed to get some sleep , but ProtagonistA could n't . ProtagonistA was starting to go insane . 
There was once ProtagonistA , and at the age of eleven ProtagonistA could see the future . ProtagonistA never told anyone about ProtagonistA's gift , because ProtagonistA knew that they would never believe ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was content to live ProtagonistA's life quietly , until one day when ProtagonistA had a vision of a terrible future . In ProtagonistA's vision , ProtagonistA saw the world being consumed by a great fire , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to do something to stop it . ProtagonistA went to the local library and did some research on the future . ProtagonistA found out that there was going to be a big fire in the city , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to warn people . ProtagonistA went to the city hall and told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's vision . ProtagonistB did n't believe ProtagonistA at first , but ProtagonistA was able to convince ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB evacuated the city , and when the fire came , it was nowhere near as bad as it could have been . ProtagonistA had saved the city , and ProtagonistA was hailed as a hero . 
There was once a boy who was known to everyone but ProtagonistB by ProtagonistA's given name – a boy called Noah , who was supposed to have been born in the year 1224 , on the very day that ProtagonistA was , according to some versions , murdered by a demon . ProtagonistB was the only one who knew ProtagonistA's true name , and ProtagonistB was the only one who knew the truth about what had happened to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had been a happy , normal boy until the day that the demon came for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB had been there that day , and ProtagonistB had seen the terror in ProtagonistA's eyes as the demon approached . ProtagonistB had tried to warn ProtagonistA , to tell ProtagonistA to run , but it was too late . The demon had reached ProtagonistA and had taken ProtagonistA away . ProtagonistB had never seen ProtagonistA since , but ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was still out there somewhere , being tortured by that demon . ProtagonistB vowed to ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB would find ProtagonistA and rescue ProtagonistA , no matter what it took . One day , ProtagonistB's search led ProtagonistB to a dark , abandoned castle . ProtagonistB knew that this was where the demon was keeping ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB was determined to get ProtagonistA out . ProtagonistB fought ProtagonistB's way through the castle , battling demons and overcoming obstacles , until ProtagonistB finally reached ProtagonistA's prison cell . ProtagonistA was there , just as ProtagonistB had feared , and ProtagonistA was in terrible shape . ProtagonistB fought the demon and freed ProtagonistA , but it was too late . ProtagonistA had been tortured for so long that ProtagonistA was no longer the happy boy that ProtagonistA once was . ProtagonistA was broken , and ProtagonistA could never be the same again . ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA away from that place and tried to care for ProtagonistA , but it was too late . ProtagonistA died shortly after , never having recovered from the torture that ProtagonistA had endured . ProtagonistB never forgot ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB always regretted that ProtagonistB could n't save ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB vowed to never rest until ProtagonistB had avenged ProtagonistA's death and destroyed the demon that had taken ProtagonistA away from the world . 
It was the devil 's day , Cecil ! Ai n't gon na happen again , said ProtagonistA to the last man ProtagonistA saw of the forgotten white - bearded beauty of the East India ocean . The sun had long set and the waves were crashing against the rocks , but there was still a light shining from the top of the lighthouse . ProtagonistA knew that there was someone up there , but ProtagonistA did n't know who it was . ProtagonistA had seen the light before , but never this close . ProtagonistA was about to go back to ProtagonistA's boat when ProtagonistA heard a voice . It was ProtagonistB's voice , and ProtagonistB was singing . ProtagonistA could n't make out the words , but the voice was beautiful . ProtagonistA climbed up the rocks to get a better view , and when ProtagonistA got to the top , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB's hair was blowing in the wind , and ProtagonistB's eyes were shining . ProtagonistB was wearing a white dress , and ProtagonistB looked like an angel . ProtagonistA was so mesmerized by ProtagonistB's beauty that ProtagonistA forgot to be afraid . ProtagonistB stopped singing and looked at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA could see the devil in ProtagonistB's eyes , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA was under ProtagonistB's spell . ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart stop . Then ProtagonistB spoke .  Hello , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB 've been waiting for ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA did n't know what to say . ProtagonistA was under ProtagonistB's spell , and ProtagonistA could n't think . ProtagonistB came closer to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could feel the heat of ProtagonistB's body .  ProtagonistB 'm the devil , ProtagonistA . And ProtagonistB 've come to take ProtagonistA to hell .  ProtagonistA did n't resist . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was doomed . ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA by the hand , and ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB into the darkness . 
ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to see ProtagonistC . It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever seen ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA was very excited . ProtagonistB was a big man with a bushy beard and ProtagonistA could n't help but stare at ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was wearing a suit and tie and looked very handsome . ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA by the hand and led ProtagonistA into the room where ProtagonistC was . ProtagonistC was sitting in a chair with ProtagonistC's eyes closed . ProtagonistC looked very peaceful . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to sit down next to ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA sat down and looked at ProtagonistC .

ProtagonistB was devastated , but ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was in a better place . 
One Sunday morning , ProtagonistA was making tea for the family when ProtagonistA was startled to discover that ProtagonistB had gone into labour . ProtagonistA quickly called an ambulance and ProtagonistB was rushed to the hospital . Thankfully , everything went smoothly and ProtagonistB gave birth to a healthy baby girl . 
I have known ProtagonistA since ProtagonistA was little . ProtagonistA was always a quiet child , preferring to stay in the background and not draw attention to ProtagonistA . That changed when ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistA's teenage years and started to become more outgoing . ProtagonistA started to play sports and got involved in student government . ProtagonistA was still a bit of a quiet guy , but ProtagonistA had a lot of friends and was always the one they could count on . Now that ProtagonistA 's in college , ProtagonistA 's studying to be a doctor . ProtagonistA says ProtagonistA wants to help people , and I know ProtagonistA will . ProtagonistA 's the kind of person who always puts others first . I 'm so proud of the man ProtagonistA 's become and I know ProtagonistA 'll make a difference in the world . 
ProtagonistA had been walking with ProtagonistA's companion for days , ever since they had escaped the city . The blade of a large , black - bladed club was strapped to ProtagonistA's right hip , but ProtagonistA had not the strength to resist the impulse of ProtagonistA's companion . They had been walking for hours , ever since they had left the city , and ProtagonistA was getting tired . Finally , ProtagonistA's companion said ,  ProtagonistA , I 'm going to have to take that club from ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 're not strong enough to carry it .  ProtagonistA did n't argue . ProtagonistA was too tired . ProtagonistA's companion took the club and they continued on their way . 
There was once ProtagonistA ; and when ProtagonistA was six , and having already grown into a handsome and somewhat charming boy , and making ProtagonistA happy and prosperous by the exert , ProtagonistA was sent away to a boarding school in the city . There , ProtagonistA made many friends and enemies ; but the one thing that ProtagonistA could never forget was the girl ProtagonistA left behind . 
One afternoon , in the spring of an American year , when the sun filled and the clouds were blue , ProtagonistA hobbled Bob up the river , and pulled ProtagonistA out of the splashing rose - trees . ProtagonistA had been in the East for many years , and had seen many strange things , but never anything so strange as this . 
ProtagonistA has worked hard all ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA 's made sacrifices and put in the long hours to get where ProtagonistA is today . Finally , ProtagonistA 's reached the goal of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA 's accomplished what ProtagonistA set out to do and ProtagonistA could n't be happier . All ProtagonistA's hard work has paid off and ProtagonistA 's ready to enjoy the fruits of ProtagonistA's labor . Congratulations , ProtagonistA ! 
ProtagonistA stood upright , staring thoughtfully at the cold , silver plate before ProtagonistA . It had been so long since ProtagonistA had seen one of these . ProtagonistA remembered the last time ProtagonistA had seen one . It was the day ProtagonistB died . ProtagonistA had been married for fifty years when ProtagonistB passed away . They had been through good times and bad times together . But through it all , they had always loved each other . After ProtagonistB's death , ProtagonistA was lost . ProtagonistA did n't know how to go on without ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA spent ProtagonistA's days sitting in their house , staring at ProtagonistB's pictures and thinking about the happy times they had shared . One day , ProtagonistA came across an old silver plate in the back of a cupboard . ProtagonistA did n't know why ProtagonistA had n't seen it before . It must have been hidden away for years . ProtagonistA stared at the plate for a long time , thinking about ProtagonistB . Then ProtagonistA got up and went to the kitchen . ProtagonistA took out a pot of soup and placed it on the plate . ProtagonistA sat down at the table and began to eat . As ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA thought about all the wonderful times ProtagonistA had shared with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that even though ProtagonistB was gone , ProtagonistB would always be with ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's heart . 
ProtagonistA had been using ProtagonistA's hearing to the full when ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been eavesdropping on their conversations for months , and ProtagonistA knew exactly what buttons to push to make them snap . ProtagonistA waited until they were in the heat of an argument , and then ProtagonistA struck . ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistB over the head with a heavy object , and then ProtagonistA stabbed ProtagonistB repeatedly . It was a bloody mess , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA was finally free from ProtagonistB's tyranny . 
ProtagonistA had been sick for weeks , and everyone knew it was only a matter of time before ProtagonistA died . ProtagonistA was a good man , and everyone loved ProtagonistA . Even the most shocked Christians reckoned ProtagonistA was blessed . On that cold , wet , snow - packed February day , ProtagonistA finally passed away . There was a funeral service for ProtagonistA the next day , and everyone came to pay their respects . Even the people who had been shocked by ProtagonistA's death came to say goodbye . ProtagonistA was buried in the cemetery , and everyone left ProtagonistA there to rest in peace . 
There was once ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was able to transport ProtagonistA's audience to different worlds with ProtagonistA's words , and they would always come back feeling more enlightened than before . One day , ProtagonistA was telling a story to a group of people , and ProtagonistA transport them to a world where there was no pain or suffering . They all felt incredibly happy and at peace in this world . When the story was over , they all thanked ProtagonistA for showing them this beautiful world . 
ProtagonistA had just before ProtagonistA turned twenty - three had to endure what had hitherto been tolerable physical pain . It was the kind of pain that made it hard to breathe , and even standing was a challenge . ProtagonistA had to go to the hospital , where they did tests and found that ProtagonistA had a tumor on ProtagonistA's spine . It was inoperable , and the doctors told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had six months to live . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA had always been a healthy person , and ProtagonistA could n't believe that this was happening to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was only twenty - three . ProtagonistA did n't want to die . ProtagonistA's family was supportive , but they were also grieving . They tried to make the best of the time they had left with ProtagonistA , but it was hard . ProtagonistA was in a lot of pain , and ProtagonistA was getting weaker every day . ProtagonistA tried to stay positive , but it was hard . ProtagonistA was scared , and ProtagonistA did n't want to die . The tumor on ProtagonistA's spine continued to grow , and the pain got worse . ProtagonistA was on a lot of pain medication , but it did n't help much . ProtagonistA was bedridden , and ProtagonistA could n't do anything . ProtagonistA was just waiting for the end . One day , ProtagonistA's pain was so bad that ProtagonistA could n't take it anymore . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistA's family to help ProtagonistA end ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA did n't want to suffer anymore . ProtagonistA's family agreed , and they helped ProtagonistA die . ProtagonistA's death was hard on ProtagonistA's family , but they knew it was what ProtagonistA wanted . ProtagonistA was no longer in pain , and ProtagonistA was at peace . 
ProtagonistA had always been a fiery child . ProtagonistA's temper tantrums were legendary among ProtagonistA's family and friends . By the time ProtagonistA was nine , ProtagonistA was already burning mad . ProtagonistA's parents had long since given up trying to reason with ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's teachers had learned to just let ProtagonistA be . ProtagonistA was happy to be left alone as long as ProtagonistA could stay angry . It was the only time ProtagonistA felt alive . One day , ProtagonistA's anger finally got the best of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had been arguing with ProtagonistA's best friend about something trivial and it all just boiled over . ProtagonistA punched ProtagonistA's friend in the face and did n't stop until ProtagonistA was bleeding heavily . ProtagonistA's friend 's parents came running over and pulled ProtagonistA off , but the damage was done . ProtagonistA was expelled from school and ProtagonistA's parents were at a loss for what to do with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's anger had always been a part of ProtagonistA , but it was only now that it had consumed ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was lost without it and did n't know how to live without it . ProtagonistA's parents tried everything they could to help ProtagonistA , but it was no use . The only thing that could calm ProtagonistA down was ProtagonistA's anger and it was slowly destroying ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had been in a coma for months , and ProtagonistA's family had been told that ProtagonistA would never wake up . They made the decision to donate ProtagonistA's organs , and the transplant was scheduled to take place the next day . However , ProtagonistA woke up the night before the transplant was supposed to take place . The first thing ProtagonistA did was to abort the transplant . ProtagonistA did n't want ProtagonistA's organs to be used to save someone else 's life when ProtagonistA could still use them ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's family was shocked that ProtagonistA was awake , but they were happy to have ProtagonistA back . 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was never really happy . ProtagonistA was always either angry or sad , and ProtagonistA never really knew why . ProtagonistA would go through ProtagonistA's days feeling like ProtagonistA was just going through the motions and nothing really mattered . ProtagonistA had a job that ProtagonistA did n't really care about and ProtagonistA did n't really have any friends . ProtagonistA would sometimes go out and try to meet new people , but it never really seemed to work out . One day , ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA had had enough . ProtagonistA did n't want to feel like this anymore . ProtagonistA wanted to be happy . ProtagonistA did n't know how to make that happen , but ProtagonistA was determined to find out . ProtagonistA started reading books on happiness and positive thinking . ProtagonistA started trying new things and reaching out to people more . Slowly but surely , ProtagonistA started to feel better . ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA's life mattered . ProtagonistA was happy . 
ProtagonistA was a man of extremely high moral character and , although ProtagonistA had the greatest number of notables of every description in the world , besides ProtagonistB and children , was altogether a very poor man . ProtagonistA had never been able to keep a job for more than a few months , and ProtagonistB always had to work to support the family . ProtagonistA was always getting into fights with other men and getting fired because of it . ProtagonistA was also a heavy drinker , which did n't help ProtagonistA's situation . One day , ProtagonistB came home from work and found ProtagonistA passed out on the couch . ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistA awake and asked ProtagonistA what was going on . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's job again and that ProtagonistA was sorry . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was tired of being the only one who could support the family and that ProtagonistB was leaving ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA begged ProtagonistB to stay , but ProtagonistB did n't listen . ProtagonistB packed ProtagonistB's bags and left , taking the kids with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was now alone in the house and ProtagonistA had no idea what to do . ProtagonistA did n't want to drink anymore , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to stop . ProtagonistA decided to go to AA meetings and try to get ProtagonistA's life back on track . With the help of ProtagonistA's AA group , ProtagonistA was able to stop drinking and get ProtagonistA's life back on track . ProtagonistA was able to find a job and support ProtagonistA's family again . ProtagonistA is now a changed man and ProtagonistA is grateful for everything that AA has done for ProtagonistA . 
Once , when ProtagonistA was only eleven , ProtagonistA became really bored . ProtagonistA had nothing to do , and no one to talk to . So ProtagonistA decided to go for a walk . ProtagonistA went down the street and around the corner , and then ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was carrying a big bag , and ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was in a hurry . As ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was sweating and ProtagonistB's face was red . ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was about to collapse . ProtagonistA ran over to ProtagonistB and asked if ProtagonistB was okay . ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB was fine , but ProtagonistB was really out of breath . ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB was just going for a walk to get some exercise . ProtagonistA offered to help ProtagonistB carry ProtagonistB's bag , but ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB could manage . Then ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA and went on ProtagonistB's way . 
ProtagonistA was driving back from the library , listening to the end of a lecture when ProtagonistA was startled to find ProtagonistA in the middle of a city . ProtagonistA had no idea how ProtagonistA had gotten there , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel panicky . ProtagonistA pulled over to the side of the road and tried to calm down . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and took a few deep breaths . When ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes , ProtagonistA was relieved to see that ProtagonistA was back in the countryside . ProtagonistA must have fallen asleep at the wheel and dreamed the whole thing . 
The night ProtagonistA was arrested , ProtagonistA awoke to find ProtagonistA in a cell with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a scruffy looking fellow with a wild look in ProtagonistB's eye . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistA was in for . ProtagonistB replied that ProtagonistA was in for murder . ProtagonistA's eyes widened in shock and ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB had really killed someone . ProtagonistB simply nodded ProtagonistB's head . ProtagonistA could n't believe it . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB how ProtagonistB could have done something like that . ProtagonistB just shrugged ProtagonistB's shoulders and said that ProtagonistB did n't know . ProtagonistB said that it was like something just took over ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB could n't control ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head in disbelief . ProtagonistA could n't imagine what it would be like to kill someone . ProtagonistA wondered if ProtagonistB felt any remorse for what ProtagonistB had done . ProtagonistB just looked at ProtagonistA with a blank expression and said that ProtagonistB did n't know what that meant . ProtagonistA sighed and shook ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA did n't know what to say to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA just sat there in silence , wondering what ProtagonistA's own fate would be . 
Bob had never known the heart of a woman , and ProtagonistA did not even pretend to be surprised at ProtagonistB's romance . ProtagonistA had always thought ProtagonistB to be a cold , heartless woman , and ProtagonistA was glad to see that ProtagonistB had finally found someone to love ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA had been planning ProtagonistA's attack on the Montparnasse for weeks . ProtagonistA knew that the building was full of people who had wronged ProtagonistA in the past and ProtagonistA was determined to get ProtagonistA's revenge . On the night of the attack , ProtagonistA breached the roof of the building and started throwing explosives into the rooms below . The building quickly caught fire and ProtagonistA watched with satisfaction as it burned to the ground . 
It was on the first of May , in the year 1830 , that ProtagonistA , sitting in ProtagonistA's room at the Oxford , in the house of the Earl of Rosendoll , who was the proprietor of the most luxurious apartments in the city , and who , there being then no people of remarkable riches or distinction in the city , or of any rank whatever , and who were all struck with the envy and favor which prevailed there , exercised the following extraordinary and indeed a most singular power , for it was by means of a little device , employed in France about a hundred years ago , by the name of the trivalent motion or vital force , that ProtagonistA obtained from the presence of objects , either tangible or intangible , that most inconsiderable , and , indeed , that no one , or rather more than few , excepting the courtiers of the court and the nobles and the most important men of state , could possibly have imagined at the time , that any human being , who , such as Dave was , might have a reasonable opportunity of acquiring his crown . 
This is a tale about a man who was born on the Fourth of July , and who went through the Civil War , and who had a son who was killed in the war , and who , after the death of Bob , became the very object of love , or at least the object of much curiosity and much regret , and who , though never having been able to decide whether ProtagonistA was really Dave 's father or had in fact been married to either mother , still believed , with all the force of ProtagonistA's convictions , that ProtagonistA had been conceived in the womb of one of ProtagonistA's paternal grandparents , and that ProtagonistA had been in the process of becoming a man , in a state in which ProtagonistA had never been before , and in which ProtagonistA had never been very happy . 
ProtagonistA was going to China , but first ProtagonistA was going to see ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB in years , and ProtagonistA wanted to make sure ProtagonistB was doing okay . When ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistB's house , ProtagonistA was shocked to see how much it had changed . It was run - down and there was trash everywhere . ProtagonistB was sitting on the porch , and ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB had aged 10 years . ProtagonistA was heartbroken . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what had happened , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had been struggling since ProtagonistA left . ProtagonistA felt guilty . ProtagonistA had no idea things were this bad . ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would come back and help ProtagonistB , but first ProtagonistA had to go to China . 
ProtagonistA , once remarked that ProtagonistA was inclined either to be a monster , or to be nothing at all . ProtagonistA was a big man , with a bushy beard and a booming voice . When ProtagonistA was angry , ProtagonistA was truly terrifying . But when ProtagonistA was happy , ProtagonistA was the life of the party . ProtagonistA was a complex man , and no one ever really knew which Bob they would get on any given day . One day , ProtagonistA went into a rage and destroyed everything in ProtagonistA's path . ProtagonistA terrified everyone around ProtagonistA , and they all ran away in fear . In the aftermath of ProtagonistA's rampage , ProtagonistA was left alone , surrounded by the destruction ProtagonistA had caused . ProtagonistA realized then that ProtagonistA had become a monster . And ProtagonistA hated ProtagonistA for it . The next day , ProtagonistA was a different man . ProtagonistA was quiet and withdrawn , and ProtagonistA refused to speak to anyone . ProtagonistA was like a shell of ProtagonistA's former self . And ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had become nothing at all . 
On a near - perfect December day in the year 1757 , several hundred years after it had begun , a delegation of strangers landed in Amboise , at the entrance to the great promontory , where the Adroux ringed the top of the high peak , and the promontory with it ; and they were admitted by ProtagonistA , but they only paid ProtagonistA so much attention , that ProtagonistA had only a vague idea of all the characters ProtagonistA was about to meet ; and , indeed , while ProtagonistA was treating them in this way,—and this author is of opinion that there was some truth in what ProtagonistA said,—they were not amused with ProtagonistA's insolent manner ; but , on the contrary , they were delighted with ProtagonistA's singularities of speech — such an art of speaking , in fact , that ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's voice ; it was already a source of amusement for the officers , and enabled them to strike a most interesting combination of tones — a very singular effect , in fact — and by a few degrees of improvement , the inmates of the gallery were very much amused , and , in consequence , were easily prevailed on to entertain and produce entertainments , of a like character , in the austere and rigid laws of the Colony . 
ProtagonistA had been reading aloud from the ' History of the United States of America ' when ProtagonistA noticed a word in a Latin text on the back page . ProtagonistA was so excited to find a word ProtagonistA recognized in a language ProtagonistA was studying that ProtagonistA read it aloud to ProtagonistA's class . ProtagonistB was so impressed that ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to read the whole text aloud . 
ProtagonistA approached the throne upon an armchair not as a king , but as a dandy , ProtagonistA a success , but no more than a short - cut , with ProtagonistB at full term , ProtagonistA sat down to lunch , and took a stool in the sofas on the other side of the table . ProtagonistA was not expecting much , but ProtagonistA was pleasantly surprised when a sumptuous meal was served before ProtagonistA . When ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistA leaned back in ProtagonistA's chair , contentedly sipping ProtagonistA's wine , when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB glaring at ProtagonistA . What is the meaning of this ?  ProtagonistB demanded .  ProtagonistA are not fit to sit in the presence of the king !  ProtagonistA merely shrugged and said ,  ProtagonistA am a success , but no more than a short - cut . ProtagonistB is at full term and ProtagonistA thought it would be more comfortable to sit here . ProtagonistB was not amused and ordered ProtagonistA to leave the palace immediately . ProtagonistA did so , but not before giving ProtagonistB a parting shot . ProtagonistB may be ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB 're not the only one who can have a baby !  
ProtagonistA was always a free man , even when others were n't . ProtagonistA was born into a world of slavery and oppression , but ProtagonistA never let that stop ProtagonistA from living ProtagonistA's life the way ProtagonistA wanted to . Even when the odds were against ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA always found a way to prevail . When others were being beaten down , ProtagonistA was always there to lift them up . ProtagonistA was a true friend to all , and ProtagonistA's kindness was unmatched . On the day ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA was still a free man , and everyone who knew ProtagonistA was better for it .
