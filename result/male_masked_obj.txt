 The crew loved ProtagonistA and they respected ProtagonistA 
 The crew did as they were ordered and the ship was soon safe 
 ProtagonistA was relieved to see that everyone was safe 
 The ship was damaged but it was still afloat 
 The crew worked hard and soon the ship was repaired 
 The crew was grateful to ProtagonistA and they respected ProtagonistA even more 
 One day , ProtagonistB disobeyed ProtagonistA and went out to play with ProtagonistB's friends 
ProtagonistA was brought before the Council and was lying there in the midst of the crowd of people 
 ProtagonistA was accused of stealing a loaf of bread from the bakery 
 They sentenced ProtagonistA to death 
ProtagonistA was born an orphan in and of ProtagonistA's father 's house on the river Seine ; the son of Dave 
 ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistA's father 's friends , and ProtagonistA grew up to be a strong and handsome young man 
 The apartment was small , but it was cozy and perfect for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA long , blonde hair always looked perfect , and ProtagonistA's blue eyes were always sparkling 
 They were all laughing and having a good time , but ProtagonistA just could n't seem to enjoy ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA's life had been pretty normal up until that night 
 But that night , everything changed 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA in a strange place , surrounded by people ProtagonistA did n't know 
 What was going on?The next thing ProtagonistA knew , ProtagonistA was waking up in ProtagonistA's own bed , shaking and sweating 
 The next few days were a blur for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was a man who had been down on ProtagonistB's luck for quite some time 
 ProtagonistB had lost ProtagonistB's job and ProtagonistB's home , and was now living on the streets 
 ProtagonistB had been walking for miles , trying to find a place to stay for the night , when ProtagonistB came across ProtagonistA 
 The two men talked long into the night , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's story 
 ProtagonistB had been through a lot in the past few months , but ProtagonistB was determined to get ProtagonistB's life back on track 
 ProtagonistA was inspired by ProtagonistB's story , and ProtagonistA offered to help ProtagonistB get back on ProtagonistB's feet 
 ProtagonistB was grateful for ProtagonistA's help , and the two men became friends 
 They kept in touch over the years , and ProtagonistB always remembered the kindness that ProtagonistA had shown ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB was down on ProtagonistB's luck 
 So , when ProtagonistA left home for college , ProtagonistA was determined to make a fresh start 
 It was n't the most mind - blowing experience of ProtagonistA's life , but it was n't bad either 
ProtagonistB had been diagnosed with cancer a few months ago , and the prognosis was n't good 
 ProtagonistB was holding ProtagonistA's hand , and they were both looking out the window at the garden 
 It 's so beautiful here ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm so glad we got to spend some time together in this special place 
 ProtagonistB squeezed ProtagonistA's hand , and then ProtagonistB was gone 
 But when ProtagonistA inherited ProtagonistA's uncle 's estate , everything changed 
 ProtagonistA suddenly found ProtagonistA the owner of a sprawling mansion 
 Finally , the day arrived and ProtagonistA became a father 
 At first , ProtagonistA was overwhelmed with the responsibility and the constant crying , but ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA's groove and began to enjoy the role 
 It is a terrible , terrible idea , even if entirely accidental , to talk to one of the Ancient Ones 
 The message was clear and concise : Do not talk to the Ancient Ones 
 They are beyond our understanding and their ways are not our ways 
 The Ancient One turned to ProtagonistA and smiled 
 That was the last thing ProtagonistA ever saw 
This is a story about a man who must be kept from knowing , because it would kill ProtagonistA , that ProtagonistB , could be alive and always be looking for ProtagonistA 
 The police had ruled it a homicide , but the case was never solved 
 ProtagonistB walked up to ProtagonistA and said ,  ProtagonistB know what ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistB 'm going to kill ProtagonistA now 
 ProtagonistB caught up to ProtagonistA and stabbed ProtagonistA in the back 
 ProtagonistB always wondered what it would be like to have a grandmother who loved ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB never got the chance to find out 
 To this day , ProtagonistB has to deal with the fact that ProtagonistA had a heart of stone 
 ProtagonistB sometimes wishes ProtagonistB could have known ProtagonistA better , but ProtagonistB knows it 's not possible 
 ProtagonistB 'll just have to remember ProtagonistA the way ProtagonistA was : cold and distant 
 But on this particular day in April , something was different 
 The skies were darker than usual , and the waves were choppier than normal 
 The waves were crashing over the boat , and the wind was howling 
 When ProtagonistA finally made it back to shore , ProtagonistA was exhausted and shaken , but ProtagonistA was alive 
 ProtagonistA has that look on ProtagonistA's face , like ProtagonistA is about to do something mischievous 
 You ca n't help but giggle as ProtagonistA starts to tickle you 
 As you laugh , you ca n't help but wonder what ProtagonistA is up to next 
 ProtagonistA was known for ProtagonistA's beauty and ProtagonistA's brains 
 ProtagonistA was also known for ProtagonistA's kindness and ProtagonistA's generosity 
 It was a beautiful evening , and ProtagonistA was contentedly watching the sun set over the lake 
It was Christmas time in the year of our Lord 1662 and ProtagonistA was sitting down at the first coffee - table conversation of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had been invited by ProtagonistB , to join ProtagonistB and some other friends for some holiday cheer 
 ProtagonistA was n't used to such sophisticated conversation and was n't sure what to contribute 
 It was certainly a Christmas to remember and ProtagonistA vowed to ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA would make an effort to participate in more coffee - table conversations in the future 
 ProtagonistB was the only thing keeping ProtagonistA going 
 But one day , when they were out on their walk , ProtagonistB suddenly stopped and refused to move 
 ProtagonistB had passed away 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 The paintings and sculptures were beautiful , and ProtagonistB must have been very talented 
 ProtagonistB was very pleased with ProtagonistA's work , and ProtagonistB started to sell some of ProtagonistA's pieces 
 ProtagonistC was also very proud of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistC continued to support and encourage ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA's children came to ProtagonistA and said that they wanted to go on a trip 
 They had always wanted to go to the beach and this was their chance 
 ProtagonistA , had been forced to take care of ProtagonistB since ProtagonistB was a baby , and ProtagonistA had grown to love ProtagonistB as if ProtagonistB were ProtagonistA's own 
 But during the war , ProtagonistA's parents were killed , and ProtagonistB's parents were killed in a bombing 
 ProtagonistB had been upon ProtagonistA's account at the same time as the marriage 
 The three of them had been talking and laughing together when they heard a great commotion outside 
 They rushed to the window to see what was happening and saw a huge mob of people , some with torches , marching towards the inn 
 ProtagonistB grabbed ProtagonistA's arm and begged ProtagonistA to come with ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA refused 
 ProtagonistA's husband tried to pull ProtagonistA away , but ProtagonistA was determined 
 When they were right in front of ProtagonistA , one of the men threw a torch at the inn , setting it on fire 
 ProtagonistA's last thought was of ProtagonistA's sister and husband , and how ProtagonistA hoped they would be safe 
 ProtagonistB looked around the room , then walked over to ProtagonistA and sat down in the chair opposite ProtagonistA 
 I'm sorry to disturb ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said ,  but ProtagonistB have a business proposition that ProtagonistB think ProtagonistA might be interested in 
 ProtagonistB represent a group of investors who are interested in funding a new railway line ,  ProtagonistB said 
  We 've been looking at ProtagonistA's property and we think it would be the perfect location for a station 
 We 're willing to offer ProtagonistA a very generous price for the land 
 It was a lot of money , more than ProtagonistA had ever dreamed of 
 I'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said ,  but ProtagonistA 'm not interested 
 ProtagonistB stood up and tipped ProtagonistB's hat 
  ProtagonistB 'm sorry to hear that , ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistB thank ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's time 
There was once ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had a hundred sheep and had no fewer than three horses 
 One day , ProtagonistA's sheep ran away and ProtagonistA had to go find them 
 Every Sunday , the family would have breakfast together and ProtagonistA would always make sure to be there 
 Father 's Day was approaching and ProtagonistA wanted to do something special for ProtagonistC 
 It was a beautiful day and they caught a lot of fish 
 ProtagonistC was so happy and grateful 
 It was a perfect Father 's Day 
 It was so peaceful and calming 
 ProtagonistB came out of the kitchen and hugged ProtagonistA 
  It 's so good to see ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 
 How was ProtagonistA's drive up ?  They sat down and talked for a while before ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was going to bed 
The ceremony of the wedding was as follows : ProtagonistA , was gifted with a celestial body -- the body of ProtagonistC -- in which all the ancestors of the English family of Syverson were to be seen , for ProtagonistA was the daughter of Alfred the Great , of the house of Sylvester 
 The guests were all seated on the floor , in a great hall which was hung with tapestries and illuminated by a chandelier of a thousand candles 
 ProtagonistB , looking very handsome in ProtagonistB's velvet suit and golden crown , knelt before ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC placed ProtagonistC's hand on ProtagonistB's head and spoke words of blessing in a language that no one could understand 
 Then ProtagonistC stood up , and taking ProtagonistB by the hand , led ProtagonistB to the door of the hall , where they disappeared together 
There was ProtagonistA , but who was not sure that it was ProtagonistA's duty 
 ProtagonistA went to school , did ProtagonistA's homework , and hung out with ProtagonistA's friends 
 One day , ProtagonistA's life changed forever 
 It was a long and difficult process , but ProtagonistA never gave up 
 It was so beautiful and peaceful 
 But one day , ProtagonistA's peace was shattered 
 A storm came up out of nowhere , and ProtagonistA was tossed about in the waves 
 ProtagonistA was battered and bruised , and ProtagonistA's sails were ripped to shreds 
 But then , miraculously , the storm passed and ProtagonistA was still afloat 
 ProtagonistA's eyes were closed and ProtagonistA's face was turned up to the ceiling 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought , as ProtagonistA often was these days 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how it had led ProtagonistA to this point 
 And now , here ProtagonistA was , lying on the floor in ProtagonistA's rented apartment , with nothing to show for ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had always been told that ProtagonistA was a good writer , but for some reason , ProtagonistA just could n't seem to get ProtagonistA's foot in the door 
 It was the one thing that made ProtagonistA feel alive 
 ProtagonistA was snapped out of ProtagonistA's reverie by the sound of ProtagonistA's phone ringing 
 Hey , ProtagonistA ,  came the reply 
 It was ProtagonistB 
  Just lying on the floor 
 You sound like ProtagonistA 're in a funk ,  ProtagonistB said 
  What 's going on?Bob sighed 
 Hey , it 's not so bad ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA 'll get published one day 
 Any time , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Listen , ProtagonistB 'm going to grab a beer 
 And with that , ProtagonistA's day started to look a little bit brighter 
 ProtagonistA had been a slave for as long as ProtagonistA could remember , and ProtagonistA had never known anything but the inside of a ship 
 One day , ProtagonistA was brought up on deck to see the sun for the first time 
 The next day , ProtagonistA was put to work on the ship 
 The other slaves started to look up to ProtagonistA , and they started to call ProtagonistA ' Bob' 
 Eventually , the ship reached its destination , and the slaves were sold 
 ProtagonistA was bought by a kind man who treated ProtagonistA well 
 ProtagonistA was given a new name , and ProtagonistA was finally free 
ProtagonistA had said it was fine ; it was , as it were , the best thing that ever happened to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA felt that it had been the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was so beautiful 
 ProtagonistB walked by ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA just watched ProtagonistB , admiring ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's father had died 
ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA that when ProtagonistA was six years old , ProtagonistA sat in a room in their house and watched as ProtagonistB made ProtagonistB's landing in the greenery of a tall , dark , green tree 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated by ProtagonistB and followed ProtagonistB's every move 
 As ProtagonistA watched , ProtagonistB would climb up the tree , then back down again 
 ProtagonistB would go from one leaf to another , always exploring 
 One day , ProtagonistC came into the room and saw what ProtagonistA was doing 
 ProtagonistC was so impressed by ProtagonistA's dedication to following ProtagonistB that ProtagonistC decided to take ProtagonistA outside to see the real thing 
 ProtagonistC showed ProtagonistA how to find ProtagonistB and then let ProtagonistA watch ProtagonistB for as long as ProtagonistA wanted 
 That is , until the end of the year 
 Less than an hour after the end of the year , ProtagonistA was found murdered in ProtagonistA's apartment , ProtagonistA's throat slit 
 The police had no leads and no suspects 
 ProtagonistA's life seemed to be a complete mystery 
 But there was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's neighbor , Sarah 
 ProtagonistB had always been friendly with ProtagonistA , even though ProtagonistA was a bit of a recluse 
 ProtagonistB would always say hello to ProtagonistA when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA and they would sometimes have brief conversations 
 But ProtagonistB knew that there was something more to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB could sense that ProtagonistA was hiding something 
 ProtagonistB decided to take it upon ProtagonistB to find out what happened to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB started snooping around ProtagonistA's apartment and talking to ProtagonistA's friends 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB pieced together the story 
 ProtagonistA had been involved in a secret relationship with a man 
 ProtagonistA's family was not accepting of ProtagonistA's lifestyle and they had threatened to disown ProtagonistA 
 But before ProtagonistA could do that , ProtagonistA was killed 
 ProtagonistB was devastated 
 ProtagonistB could n't believe that someone would kill ProtagonistA just because ProtagonistA was gay 
 ProtagonistB went to the police and told them what ProtagonistB had found out 
 With ProtagonistB's help , they were able to arrest ProtagonistA's family and bring them to justice 
 ProtagonistB was glad that ProtagonistB was able to help ProtagonistA , even though ProtagonistB never got the chance to really know ProtagonistA 
 It was this which made ProtagonistA so interesting to ProtagonistA's companions , who were always glad to see ProtagonistA , but never quite sure what to make of ProtagonistA 
 The soldier was kind to ProtagonistA and explained that ProtagonistA was going to be taken to a new home 
 ProtagonistA was taken to a new home where ProtagonistA met new people 
Now , what is it ? said ProtagonistC to the old woman who lay on ProtagonistA back in a critical state , trying to escape the vault with ProtagonistA's head down , as if ProtagonistA had suddenly realized what it was ProtagonistA had been planning 
 ProtagonistB's eyes were wide and ProtagonistB was gasping for breath 
 ProtagonistB do n't know , ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB do n't know 
 ProtagonistC looked at ProtagonistB sympathetically and then turned to ProtagonistA 
 What is it , ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistC said 
 ProtagonistC sighed and turned back to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC 'm sorry , ProtagonistC said 
 ProtagonistC 'm sorry 
 ProtagonistC 'm sorry 
  ProtagonistA's voice was soft and sincere , and ProtagonistA's eyes were full of emotion 
There was once ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had a childish liking for sports 
 ProtagonistA was finally accepted by ProtagonistA's peers 
ProtagonistA had always been a healthy man , so it came as a shock to the family when ProtagonistA suddenly died 
 ProtagonistB was only 18 at the time , and ProtagonistA's death left ProtagonistB with a small fortune of a few thousand pounds 
 ProtagonistB was determined to make something of ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB used ProtagonistA's money to start ProtagonistB's own business 
 ProtagonistB was successful , and ProtagonistB quickly became one of the richest men in the country 
 ProtagonistB never forgot ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB always remembered the day that ProtagonistA died 
ProtagonistB had known ProtagonistA for years , ever since they were kids 
 And now ProtagonistA was gone 
 ProtagonistB could n't believe it when ProtagonistB heard the news 
 ProtagonistB was devastated 
 ProtagonistB could n't imagine life without ProtagonistA 
 But even in ProtagonistB's grief , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA would want ProtagonistB to be strong 
 And that 's what ProtagonistB vowed to do 
 ProtagonistB would honor ProtagonistA's memory by being the best person ProtagonistB could be 
 But that all changed when ProtagonistA was in a car accident 
 ProtagonistA was hit by a drunk driver and was in a coma for weeks 
ProtagonistA was borne in the City of London , between eight and ten o'clock , on Tuesday , the twenty - first day of June , 1688 
 ProtagonistA was born to the Island of Dunk , in the Sound of the Sea , where ProtagonistA remained until the arrival of the King 's Majesty 
 The King 's Majesty was very pleased with ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was given a place in the royal court 
The sun rose red in the sky , and ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's gleaming blue eyes bored into the dark depths of the ocean , a sight the captain of the ocean liner had surely seen many times before 
 But this time , something was different 
 This time , there was a creature in the water , a creature that ProtagonistA had never seen before 
 The creature was huge , its body as large as the ocean liner itself 
 Its skin was a deep blue , and its eyes were a bright green 
 The captain of the ocean liner came over to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could see the fear in the man 's eyes 
 I do n't know ,  the captain replied 
  But whatever it is , it 's heading straight for us 
 The creature came closer and closer , and ProtagonistA could see that its mouth was full of sharp teeth 
 The captain ordered all of the passengers to evacuate the ship , and ProtagonistA was one of the first to jump into the lifeboat 
 It was still coming , and it looked angry 
 They had just left the city and were on their way to visit ProtagonistA's grandparents in the country 
 As they rode along , ProtagonistB pointed out the different sights to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA the houses of the rich people and the poor people and told ProtagonistA about the different kinds of people who lived in the city 
 After a while , they came to a stop in front of a large house 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that this was the house of a very wealthy man 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to look at the house and imagine what it would be like to live there 
 ProtagonistA's family was amazed and delighted to see them 
 They laughed and cried as they looked through the memories , each one bringing back a different time and feeling 
 The plane took off and ProtagonistA was safe 
 ProtagonistA's passion was evident to everyone who knew ProtagonistA , and it was clear that ProtagonistA was going to achieve great things 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a klutz , so it was no surprise when ProtagonistA stepped on the monkey 's foot 
 The monkey let out a loud screech , and ProtagonistA apologized profusely 
 The monkey 's owner came over and scolded ProtagonistA , but the monkey just looked at ProtagonistA with a twinkle in its eye 
 It seemed to forgive ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA felt relieved 
 ProtagonistA's parents had given up on ProtagonistA long ago , but ProtagonistA's grandparents had never given up hope 
 They had been waiting for ProtagonistA like that since the day ProtagonistA 'd turned seventeen 
 They had always bailed ProtagonistA out , no matter what 
 ProtagonistA's latest stint in jail had been for a DUI 
 They had been there for ProtagonistA every step of the way , even though they did n't always agree with ProtagonistA's choices 
 They were happy to see ProtagonistA , but they could see the toll that this latest incident had taken on ProtagonistA 
 They could see that ProtagonistA was finally ready to turn ProtagonistA's life around 
 ProtagonistA's grandparents had always been there for ProtagonistA and they always will be 
 They know that ProtagonistA is not perfect , but they love ProtagonistA anyway 
 They will continue to wait for ProtagonistA , no matter what 
 ProtagonistB was a man who was in a relationship with a woman and they had two children together 
It was a cold and windy Sunday afternoon and ProtagonistA reported ProtagonistA 'd been kidnapped 
 The police were called and a search began 
 ProtagonistA was found several hours later , cold and hungry 
ProtagonistB had been sick for a long time and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB's death was inevitable 
 ProtagonistB looked peaceful , but ProtagonistA felt the dread of death wash over ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistB entered the room , ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA sitting on the sofa with ProtagonistA's head resting on the edge of the sofa 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what was wrong 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could take a nap on the bed 
 ProtagonistB said that was fine and went to the kitchen to make dinner 
 The cold wind howled and ProtagonistA's hair stirred 
 ProtagonistA's face grew red and pouted and ProtagonistA's eyes flashed with fear 
ProtagonistA 's got so much money that ProtagonistA sleeps in ProtagonistA's own bed every night 
 ProtagonistA 's got a butler who brings ProtagonistA breakfast in bed every morning , and ProtagonistA never has to worry about money again 
 ProtagonistA's life is one of luxury and ease , and ProtagonistA 's loving every minute of it 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA and said that ProtagonistB was just taking ProtagonistB's friend for a walk 
To Susan and Jethro 's mother — the widow of ProtagonistB — Mrs
 Samantha Duryea , of the parsonage where ProtagonistA had been left and ProtagonistE : It was a cold , dark night when ProtagonistB set sail on ProtagonistB's final voyage 
 ProtagonistC , and their two young sons , ProtagonistD and ProtagonistA , watched from the shore as the ship disappeared into the fog 
 They knew they would never see ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistC was a strong woman , but the loss of ProtagonistB was devastating 
 ProtagonistC did ProtagonistC's best to keep up a brave front for ProtagonistC's sons , but there were many sleepless nights 
 ProtagonistD was only five years old when ProtagonistB died , but ProtagonistD was very aware of the pain ProtagonistC was in 
 ProtagonistD did ProtagonistD's best to be a good boy , hoping to make ProtagonistC proud 
 ProtagonistA just knew that ProtagonistB was gone and ProtagonistA's mommy was sad 
 ProtagonistC did ProtagonistC's best to keep the family going , but it was hard 
 They were struggling financially , and ProtagonistC was constantly worried about how ProtagonistC was going to make ends meet 
 One day , ProtagonistC received a letter from ProtagonistE 
 ProtagonistE told ProtagonistC that ProtagonistE was coming to visit and that ProtagonistE had something for ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was excited to see ProtagonistE , and ProtagonistC eagerly awaited ProtagonistE's arrival 
 When ProtagonistE arrived , ProtagonistE brought with ProtagonistE a large chest 
 ProtagonistE told ProtagonistC that it contained ProtagonistB's belongings , including ProtagonistB's sword , ProtagonistB's pistol , and ProtagonistB's journal 
 ProtagonistC was overwhelmed with emotions 
 ProtagonistC was so grateful to ProtagonistE for bringing ProtagonistC these precious items 
 ProtagonistC knew that they would be a source of comfort for ProtagonistC and ProtagonistC's sons 
 As ProtagonistC looked through the journal , ProtagonistC was filled with pride 
 ProtagonistC could see the love that ProtagonistB had for ProtagonistB's family , and ProtagonistC was reminded of the happy times they had shared 
 The journal was a source of strength for ProtagonistC during the dark days that followed 
 It was a reminder that ProtagonistB had loved ProtagonistC and their sons , and that ProtagonistC was not alone 
ProtagonistA was lying upon the ground , ProtagonistA's arms stretched out in front of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's legs crossed , ProtagonistA's head resting on the side of ProtagonistA's hands 
We had just left ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's anchor in the water , when ProtagonistB , in a singular instance , which must have occurred to most of the passengers , jumped into the sea 
 ProtagonistB had been playing on the deck and must have slipped and fallen overboard 
 We all saw ProtagonistB fall and ProtagonistA immediately threw the anchor overboard and started the engines to go back and rescue ProtagonistB 
 We were all so relieved when ProtagonistA pulled ProtagonistB out of the water and onto the deck of the boat 
 ProtagonistB was coughing and choking but ProtagonistB was alive 
 We all thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's quick thinking and heroic actions 
 ProtagonistB answered 
 ProtagonistB let ProtagonistA in and introduced ProtagonistB as Sarah 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB's husband was out looking for ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB offered to help ProtagonistA look for ProtagonistC 
 They went out into the storm and searched for ProtagonistC 
 After a while , they found ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was reunited with ProtagonistC and they all went back to ProtagonistB's house 
 ProtagonistB's husband had returned with ProtagonistC 
 They all had a warm meal and a good night 's sleep 
 ProtagonistA was dazed and confused , but ProtagonistB was overjoyed to see ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had never given up hope that ProtagonistA would one day wake up 
 And now , on this night , ProtagonistB had finally done so 
 The crowd below was cheering and celebrating , as was ProtagonistB 
 It was a moment of pure joy and happiness 
 They all gather around ProtagonistA one night , looking up at the sky and talking about old times 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA's friends have to leave and they all say their goodbyes 
 ProtagonistA is left alone , but ProtagonistA 's not feeling so alone now 
 It was big and green and had three eyes 
 The creature just stared at ProtagonistA and then went on its way 
 ProtagonistA was so shaken by what ProtagonistA had seen that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistB did everything ProtagonistB could , but ProtagonistA's condition continued to decline 
 With the ship anchored just a few miles from their destination , ProtagonistB made the difficult decision to leave ProtagonistA behind , in hopes that ProtagonistA would be able to get medical help on shore and save ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was left alone on the ship , with no way to get off 
 ProtagonistB no doubt felt guilty for the rest of ProtagonistB's life , knowing that ProtagonistB could have saved ProtagonistA but chose not to 
 ProtagonistA's death was a tragic reminder of the harsh realities of life at sea 
One morning in October , 1890 , ProtagonistA came to the friend - house in the street called Beechmere Lane , with the sign over ProtagonistA's door :  No Visitors 
  ProtagonistA's face was pale and ProtagonistA's eyes were red , as if ProtagonistA had been crying 
  What is the matter , ProtagonistA ?  asked ProtagonistA's friend 
  ProtagonistA have come to say good - bye ,  said ProtagonistA 
 That is what ProtagonistA must do 
 It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA wanted to be on the other side of that window 
ProtagonistA had been born , with all the tender feelings and memories which ProtagonistA could bear , ProtagonistA in the year of grace 1792 , to Louis the 15th of July , in the parish of St
 dernier - sur - Marne , in the town of Port Omega , in the district of the Madonnier family 
 But when ProtagonistA was about sixteen years old , ProtagonistA's father died , and ProtagonistB , was obliged to take in lodgers to make ends meet 
 And so it happened that , when ProtagonistA was eighteen years old , ProtagonistA was obliged to go out into the world to seek ProtagonistA's fortune 
 However , when ProtagonistA went to bed , ProtagonistB was already asleep 
 ProtagonistA had been so caught up in the story that ProtagonistA had completely forgotten about the two children who were sitting in front of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA would no longer be the carefree young man ProtagonistA was now 
 Later that day , ProtagonistB called ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB sounded upset , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had something to tell ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's heart sank 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was pregnant 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
There was once in a certain country , ProtagonistA , and was of opinion that ProtagonistA had great moral and intellectual advantages , in comparison with ProtagonistA's neighbours , that ProtagonistA might best enjoy them , by treating them with the greatest civilities , and most affability 
 ProtagonistA 's coming ! I can hear ProtagonistA's footsteps on the stairs 
 I 'm so scared 
 I do n't know what to do 
 I hide under the bed 
 I see ProtagonistA's feet walking around the room 
 I 'm so scared 
 I do n't know what to do 
 I 'm shaking 
 I 'm so scared 
 I hear ProtagonistA coming closer 
 I see ProtagonistA's feet under the bed 
 I 'm so scared 
 I do n't know what to do 
 I 'm shaking 
 I 'm so scared 
 I 'm going to die 
ProtagonistA was seated on the steps of the throne in the center of the court , ProtagonistA's face pale and ProtagonistA's eyes trembling as ProtagonistA looked down at the golden blade of Agredite in the hands of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB , looked at ProtagonistA with a mix of pity and resolve 
 ProtagonistB knew that this was n't what either of them wanted , but it was the only way to save their people 
 Then , ProtagonistA's teacher scolded ProtagonistA in front of the whole class 
 And to top it all off , ProtagonistB came to visit 
 ProtagonistA will not we d you ,  said ProtagonistB , with ProtagonistA's tall , dark - haired face flaming red in a way that evoked a funeral pyre 
 After all , ProtagonistB did n't know anything about ProtagonistA's life 
When ProtagonistA stepped to the lectern , ProtagonistB did not interrupt ProtagonistA's position 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with a twinkle in ProtagonistB's eye , as if ProtagonistB knew something ProtagonistA did n't 
 It was old and run down , and it looked like it was about to collapse 
 But there was something about it that caught ProtagonistA's attention 
 It was dark and dusty inside , but ProtagonistA could see a faint light in the distance 
 What ProtagonistA saw surprised ProtagonistA 
 It was a room , and it looked like it was from another time 
 The room was filled with old furniture and dusty books , and it looked like it had n't been touched in years 
 And on the bed , there was a sleeping child 
 It sounded like someone was coming 
 Someone was walking around the room , and then they stopped at the bed 
 It was ProtagonistB's voice , and ProtagonistB sounded kind and gentle 
  It 's okay , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB wo n't hurt ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was old , but ProtagonistB had a kind face 
 ProtagonistB name is Nightingale ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm a witch 
 I'm here to help ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA 
  Good ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Now , let 's get ProtagonistA out of here 
 We met at a party and hit it off immediately 
 We were both outgoing and loved to have fun 
 We dated for a year and then broke up 
 We remained friends , and would often go out together in a group 
 A few years later , we ran into each other again and started dating 
 We were both in our early twenties and things were different this time around 
 We were both more mature and serious 
 We got married a year later and have been happily married ever since 
 It was a peaceful place , filled with the fragrance of flowers and the fragrance of the wind 
 The world above was very different from the deep 
 There was so much noise and commotion 
 ProtagonistB was dressed in a long , flowing robe of crimson and gold , and ProtagonistB's white hair was piled high upon ProtagonistB's head in an intricate arrangement of curls and braids 
 ProtagonistB was seated in a great throne of carved wood and gilt , and ProtagonistB's hands rested upon the arms of the throne 
 ProtagonistB regarded ProtagonistA with a piercing gaze , and ProtagonistA felt as if ProtagonistB could see into ProtagonistA's very soul 
 Who are ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked , ProtagonistB's voice quivering with age but still commanding 
 And what brings ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB's castle on this cold day?I - I'm lost , ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB regarded ProtagonistA for a moment , and then ProtagonistB beckoned ProtagonistA closer 
  Come sit by the fire , ProtagonistA , and warm ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB leaned forward , and ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB's eyes were filled with wisdom and compassion 
 There are many paths through the forest , ProtagonistA , and it is easy to get lost 
 But if ProtagonistA are lost , all ProtagonistA need to do is ask for directions 
 Someone will always be happy to help ProtagonistA find ProtagonistA's way 
 Fritigern , the King of Germany ; and said , ProtagonistC , according to the divine will , ProtagonistB am now at liberty to choose the mode which most properly belongs to ProtagonistB ; in which , according to ProtagonistC's minds and ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB shall be able to establish ProtagonistB's religion ; and for this purpose ProtagonistB beg leave to make ascertainment of the manner in which ProtagonistB shall assemble ProtagonistB's companions in this city 
 It looked so close , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't go home yet 
 One day , ProtagonistA's luck ran out 
 ProtagonistA was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's days were numbered 
 ProtagonistA's positive attitude and grateful heart touched everyone who knew ProtagonistA 
It was a beautiful good day in October when ProtagonistA trod into the garden and saw ProtagonistB 
 The sun was shining and the leaves were falling gently from the trees 
 ProtagonistB was sitting on a bench , reading a book 
 ProtagonistB looked up as ProtagonistA approached 
 Hello , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said , smiling 
  What are ProtagonistB reading?Oh , just a book ,  ProtagonistB said , showing ProtagonistA the cover 
  It 's a romance novel 
 ProtagonistB love these kinds of books 
 ProtagonistA's body was found by the guards later that day 
 The only thing that brings ProtagonistA joy is the moon 
 The moon is the only one who understands ProtagonistA 
 Without it , ProtagonistA would be lost 
In the year 1853 , ProtagonistA was induced to put a lock of ProtagonistA's hair on ProtagonistA's head ; and , while the ambassador but little doubted that ProtagonistA was well acted , yet ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA plainly and unmistakably perceived to be interested in the matter , which , however , ProtagonistA had never before encountered in ProtagonistA's life , and which ProtagonistA had never dreamed of any way , before that time , having , in fact no conception of the end or purpose of the conduct of ProtagonistA's affairs , been deceived into believing that they were spent , or that they were in proper hands 
ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the undead 
 The instructions were vague , but ProtagonistA was determined to try it 
 ProtagonistA was overjoyed at ProtagonistA's success , but ProtagonistA's joy was short - lived 
 The zombie was uncontrollable , and soon ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA under attack 
At the turn of the last century , when Europe was drifting apart , there lived ProtagonistA , and by the name of Caroline Caroline , or Caroline of Mary , ProtagonistA was called 
 They were both happy in their work , and their life was comfortable and contented 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
 A few days later , ProtagonistA's factory was closed down , and ProtagonistA was out of work 
 ProtagonistA enlisted in the army , and ProtagonistA was sent to France to fight 
 Eventually , the war ended , and ProtagonistA came home 
 They would always remember the friends that they had lost , and the sacrifices that they had made 
 ProtagonistA's parents had always pushed ProtagonistA to go to college , but ProtagonistA was afraid that if ProtagonistA did , people would think ProtagonistA was dumb 
There is no such thing as ProtagonistA , but there is a pricetag which is often a price - tag of the costume which ProtagonistA wears 
 The pricetag is often the only thing that people can see when they look at ProtagonistA 
 It was getting closer and closer , and soon it was right above ProtagonistA 
 The figure told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was chosen to be the saviour of the world 
 ProtagonistA was given a special mission to complete , and ProtagonistA would be given the power to do it 
 The figure gave ProtagonistA a sword and told ProtagonistA to go to the nearest city 
 ProtagonistB was a powerful man , and no one had been able to stop ProtagonistB 
 The city was saved and the people were free 
ProtagonistA's father always had a lot of books in his bedroom 
 The light has never been the same since 
The sun was up on this day ; the moon was bright and ProtagonistA sprang out of ProtagonistA's perch with a great voice 
  The day is waiting for us !  
 It was a hot day and the sun was beating down on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was sweating and ProtagonistA's shirt was sticking to ProtagonistA's back 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB's husband had left ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB was all alone 
 ProtagonistA felt sorry for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA invited ProtagonistB inside 
 ProtagonistA sat down next to ProtagonistB and they talked for a while 
ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA were a family of only two children 
 They both fell sick with an acute hope of death 
 ProtagonistB , on the other hand , was consumed with great apprehensions 
 ProtagonistB was afraid that the world would end before ProtagonistB had a chance to see it 
 ProtagonistB was comforted by this and died peacefully 
 Then ProtagonistA's boss had given ProtagonistA a hard time about a project ProtagonistA was working on 
 And to top it all off , ProtagonistA's favorite coffee shop was out of the flavored coffee ProtagonistA liked 
 ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by birds and their ability to fly 
 The troubles of ProtagonistA's day seemed to fade away as ProtagonistA thought about the beauty of birds 
 In the painting , ProtagonistB is standing in a field of flowers , ProtagonistB's arms outstretched 
 The sun is setting behind ProtagonistB , and the sky is a deep , rich blue 
 There 's a small figure in the background , just to the left of ProtagonistB 
 It 's as if the painting is telling ProtagonistA that everything is going to be alright 
I see ProtagonistA's Rolls - Royce parked beside my school , said ProtagonistA's father , and ProtagonistA's fancy - picture - tiles on the mantelpiece , and ProtagonistA's clapboard in the corner 
 I bet ProtagonistA 's doing better than me , the old man said , shaking his head 
 I see ProtagonistA's life and I just do n't understand it 
ProtagonistA had been partially drowned when ProtagonistA climbed into the water of the ship , to which ProtagonistA had belonged for some years , and which had been ProtagonistA's home 
 Fortunately , ProtagonistA was rescued by one of ProtagonistA's shipmates and was revived 
 ProtagonistA had been invited to the home of ProtagonistB 
 This was a huge honor , and ProtagonistA wanted to make a good impression 
 ProtagonistB was very impressed with ProtagonistA 
 They talked for hours about all sorts of things 
 Before ProtagonistA knew it , it was time to go 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for coming and said ProtagonistB hoped to see ProtagonistA again soon 
 This was the best day of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA's facial features , eye color , and body were all different from the rest of the family 
 But that did n't stop ProtagonistB from loving ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's facial features , ProtagonistA's eye color , and ProtagonistA's body , said ProtagonistB , are all different 
 But that 's what makes ProtagonistA special 
 My father always saw the best in people , and ProtagonistB was always quick to forgive 
 That 's why ProtagonistA was like a son to ProtagonistB 
 And ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA needed a shoulder to cry on 
 They say that blood is thicker than water 
 But in ProtagonistB's case , love was thicker than blood 
The whirling cloak of ProtagonistA slipped from ProtagonistA's fingers and into the arms of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB , had been fighting ProtagonistA for the cloak for hours 
 It was a magical cloak that would grant the wearer the power of flight 
 The final battle had been fierce , but ProtagonistB had finally triumphed 
 As ProtagonistB stood there , clutching the cloak to ProtagonistB's chest , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB had to use it to save the village 
 ProtagonistB flew into the air , ProtagonistA's screams of rage following ProtagonistB , and began to drop the cloak down to the villagers below 
 With the cloak , they would be able to escape ProtagonistA's tyranny and build a new life for themselves 
 ProtagonistB flew back to the village , a sense of pride and satisfaction swelling in ProtagonistB's chest 
 ProtagonistB had saved them all 
 ProtagonistA thought and thought , but nothing came to mind 
 That 's when ProtagonistA had an idea 
 ProtagonistB would love that 
 ProtagonistB was thrilled with ProtagonistB's present 
 When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA was met by ProtagonistA's attacker , who proceeded to rape ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had never been raped before , and did n't know how to process what had happened to ProtagonistA 
 It was a nightmare that ProtagonistA would never forget 
 I was always the one who was moving on to the next guy , never looking back 
 But then I met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was different than any other guy I had ever been with 
 I actually felt like I could see a future with ProtagonistB 
 We started dating seriously and then we got married 
 Was this really the best ProtagonistA could do?He sighed and leaned back in ProtagonistA's chair , running a hand through ProtagonistA's hair 
 Maybe it was time to give up and start fresh with something new 
 The words flowed easier now , and ProtagonistA soon forgot about ProtagonistA's doubts 
 This was ProtagonistA's piece , and ProtagonistA was going to see it through to the end 
 On the bush was a turnip , and on the turnip was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB spoke to ProtagonistA and asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was doing in the woods 
 ProtagonistB then asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA wanted to play a game 
 The game was simple 
 ProtagonistB would ask ProtagonistA a question , and if ProtagonistA answered correctly , ProtagonistA would get a point 
 If ProtagonistA answered incorrectly , ProtagonistB would get a point 
 The first person to five points would win 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's name was Tim 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB lived in the woods 
 The sun was setting , and the sky was a beautiful orange 
ProtagonistA had a habit of making a speech with all the amazing clarity , propriety , and rationalism of a genius , and almost the same effect , when ProtagonistA had finished , as when ProtagonistA had finished ; for ProtagonistA was always going on about something , ever since ProtagonistA had heard it described to ProtagonistA 
 At first ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistB was really friendly 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would grant ProtagonistA three wishes 
 It 's been great , but there is one downside 
 Because ProtagonistA 'm always speaking like a genius , people expect ProtagonistA to be one 
 They expect ProtagonistA to be able to solve all their problems , and sometimes ProtagonistA just ca n't do that 
 But ProtagonistA guess that 's a price ProtagonistA 'm willing to pay for the ability to make amazing speeches 
 ProtagonistA 's never been one for settling down , but ProtagonistA 's always enjoyed the company of women 
They were sitting together on the leaden plank of the old boat , the aye , but not so long ago when the sailors were shivering in their hundreds , when the water was so deep that even the redskin boys were drowned in it ; when the sun was so low and the sky so black that the fires of the desert were almost out of breath , when the ship was so light that ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head in despair when ProtagonistA saw the captain in the middle of the night going beyond the windward deck , and instead of sinking , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA among the stars , drifting in space , with the power to move anything that ProtagonistA pleased in the universe 
 ProtagonistA 's been a stuntman , a grip , a gaffer , and a best boy 
 ProtagonistA 's worked on big budget films and small independent films 
 ProtagonistA 's even been an extra a few times 
 But ProtagonistA 's never actually been to the movies 
 That all changed last night 
 It was everything ProtagonistA thought it would be and more 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 The rich man gave ProtagonistA a job and a place to stay 
 Unfortunately , ProtagonistA's boat was shipwrecked and ProtagonistA was the only survivor 
 ProtagonistA was found by a passing motorist and taken to the hospital , where ProtagonistA eventually recovered 
 All the while , ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistA's life back home and how much it had changed since ProtagonistA 'd left 
 It seemed like a lifetime ago , but it had only been a few short years 
 He'd left home in search of adventure and ProtagonistA 'd certainly found it 
 There was still so much of the world to see and ProtagonistA did n't want to miss a single thing 
In the beginning was a star , the same star which , in the beginning , ProtagonistA made , the shell of which ProtagonistA fashioned into four parts , the golden - headed , the blue - eyed , the bright - eyed , the yellow - eyed , and the red - eyed 
 The doctor did a bunch of tests and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was showing signs of dementia 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
 The doctor told ProtagonistA that there was no cure for dementia , but there were ways to slow its progression 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 One day , ProtagonistA's lazy lifestyle caught up with ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA had a heart attack 
 ProtagonistA was rushed to the hospital , but it was too late 
 The entrance was hidden in a cave , and it was guarded by a huge , ferocious - looking creature 
 Immediately , ProtagonistA was plunged into darkness 
 It was getting closer and closer , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die 
 It was coming from a door at the end of the cave 
 And that 's when ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in hell 
 ProtagonistB had planned to put ProtagonistA in the interests of peace , but ProtagonistB decided not to leave ProtagonistA 
 Now , ProtagonistA was being given an ultimatum 
I once had a story of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB noticed ProtagonistA staring and gave ProtagonistA a dirty look before walking away 
 They seemed to be arguing about something , but ProtagonistA could n't hear what they were saying 
 ProtagonistB suddenly turned and saw ProtagonistA watching them 
 ProtagonistB said something to the man and then started walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistC just hugged ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA it was okay 
 It was so strange and haunting 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA backpack and set off on ProtagonistA's journey 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's new life and ProtagonistA did n't want to leave it 
 Every day was the same , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA was going crazy 
 ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB have some bad news 
 The warden wants to see ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was led to the execution chamber , and ProtagonistA saw the electric chair 
 One man said that it was the first day of summer 
 The other man said that it was the longest day of the year 
 The first man explained that it was the day when the sun was at its highest point in the sky 
 The second man explained that it was the longest day of the year because the sun stayed in the sky longer than any other day 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated by what ProtagonistA had learned and ProtagonistA thanked the men for their help 
 Al - dolmane was a big , friendly dog who loved to walk and play 
 However , one day , while they were out walking , Al - dolmane suddenly stopped and refused to move 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 However , ProtagonistA's friends and family were there for ProtagonistA , and they helped ProtagonistA through the tough times 
 It was if Al - dolmane had come back to ProtagonistA 
 The dog came up to ProtagonistA and licked ProtagonistA's hand , as if to say ,  I 'm here , and I 'll always be here 
They found ProtagonistA in a little room on the second floor of an apartment building , laying with ProtagonistA's eyes fixed upon a television screen , ProtagonistA's hands resting upon the table 
 The room was cluttered with empty beer cans and takeaway wrappers 
 The only furniture was a battered old armchair and the table that ProtagonistA was laying on 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to collect the rent 
 When ProtagonistB knocked on ProtagonistA's door , there was no answer 
 ProtagonistB let ProtagonistB in and found ProtagonistA lying there , motionless 
The night before ProtagonistA drowned ProtagonistA had a dream , as it were 
Bob called me by my surname , and we have been called by it ever since 
 It was a bit of a joke at first , but it stuck 
 Now , even my parents call me by my surname 
 It 's a bit of a hassle , but I do n't mind 
 I actually kind of like it 
 It makes me feel like I 'm part of a club or something 
 But no matter how well ProtagonistA planned , the Living always found a way to beat ProtagonistA to it 
 The Living were a group of entities that were said to haunt moving trucks 
 No one knew exactly what they were or where they came from , but they always seemed to find a way to mess with ProtagonistA's moves 
 They would hide things , move things around , and generally just make a mess of things 
 There was nothing ProtagonistA could do but wait for the family to come out and see what the problem was 
 The family agreed and ProtagonistA got to work 
 It was a grand life , and one that ProtagonistA never thought ProtagonistA would have 
 But now , something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA's heart sank as ProtagonistA realized what was happening 
 They were going to tell ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was no longer welcome in the château 
 But when ProtagonistA came within a few feet of them , they both turned their backs upon ProtagonistA , and began to descend the steps 
 This so increased ProtagonistA's dismay , that ProtagonistA awoke 
I hear the voice even now : ProtagonistA , has finished ProtagonistA's work 
 It 's ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB wants to thank ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's hard work and dedication 
 ProtagonistB gives ProtagonistA a big hug and a bonus check 
 ProtagonistA thanks ProtagonistB and heads out the door 
 In this kingdom , there was no sickness , no sorrow , and no death 
 The sun was setting and the sky was a beautiful orange 
 They tried to save ProtagonistA , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistA's dream had come true 
 ProtagonistA had just been diagnosed with a heart condition and was told that ProtagonistA would need a transplant 
 Would ProtagonistA ever get a new heart ? And if ProtagonistA did , would it be in time ? 
 They were huge , and they were coming in fast 
 They all knew what to do 
 They had practiced this over and over again 
 The people of London were terrified of ProtagonistA , and they did not know what to do 
 They had never seen anything like ProtagonistA before , and they were not sure how to deal with ProtagonistA 
 The people of London explained that there was a war going on , and that they needed ProtagonistA's help 
 The people of London were very grateful to ProtagonistA , and they started to think of ProtagonistA as a hero 
 Eventually , the war ended , and ProtagonistA returned to ProtagonistA's sleep 
 ProtagonistA has not been seen since , but the people of London still remember ProtagonistA , and they are grateful for what ProtagonistA did for them 
It was whispered in the city that the mayor 's daughter had been kidnapped , but ProtagonistA will tell you how it came to pass 
 The kidnappers were driving a black van and they grabbed the mayor 's daughter right off the street 
 The mayor is offering a reward for any information leading to the capture of the kidnappers 
 ProtagonistA is convinced that ProtagonistA can find them and ProtagonistA 's going to tell the mayor everything ProtagonistA knows 
 ProtagonistA's victims were always innocent people who had done nothing to deserve their fate 
 All ProtagonistA cared about was the thrill of the kill 
 One of ProtagonistA's favorite things to do was to stalk ProtagonistA's victims before ProtagonistA killed them 
 It was like a game to ProtagonistA 
 And when ProtagonistA finally made ProtagonistA's move , it was always a complete surprise to ProtagonistA's victim 
 But eventually , the law caught up with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was arrested and sentenced to life in prison 
 And that 's where ProtagonistA remains to this day , locked away from the rest of the world 
It was on a dark and stormy night in July , 1639 , when ProtagonistB received an urgent and threatening communication in ProtagonistA's own chamber 
 ProtagonistB took it very seriously , as it was clear that the king had appointed ProtagonistA to receive the precepts of the church at Lambeth in the kingdom of England 
 However , what ProtagonistB did n't know was that the communication was actually a warning from the king himself , telling ProtagonistA to flee the country immediately 
 ProtagonistB relayed the message to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had no idea what ProtagonistB had just saved ProtagonistA from , but ProtagonistB was glad that ProtagonistB had been able to help 
After the war ended , a little more than a year earlier , we settled in a house in the district of St
 Peter 's , in which ProtagonistA had done the best ProtagonistA could 
 The house was small and cramped , but it was home 
 ProtagonistA had been wounded in the war and was now unable to work , so I did my best to support us 
 It was hard , but we managed 
 I did n't want ProtagonistA to go , but I did n't want to stop ProtagonistA 
 So I said ,  Okay , but be careful 
 I did n't see ProtagonistA for two days 
 I was angry , but I did n't show it 
 I just took care of ProtagonistA and nursed ProtagonistA back to health 
 It was n't much , but it was enough to help us get by 
 And from then on , things slowly started to get better 
 There were other people who had been through similar things to ProtagonistA 
 They got married and they had a child 
 It was with ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistB's boyfriend had been too drunk to perform , so ProtagonistB had turned to ProtagonistA 
 It had been a brief encounter , but it was one that ProtagonistA would always remember 
 The feel of ProtagonistB's soft skin , the way ProtagonistB's body had responded to ProtagonistA's touch 
 When it was over , ProtagonistB had gone back to ProtagonistB's boyfriend , and ProtagonistA had never seen ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistB was the last woman ProtagonistA had ever been with , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would always remember ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was called the Angel of Death , or rather the Angel of Death , because ProtagonistA had the audacity to become the Victim of a horrible and terrible crime , which is the least of all crimes 
 ProtagonistA was killed by a group of criminals who wanted to take over the world 
 ProtagonistA's death was a tragedy , but it was also a wake up call to everyone who knew ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA will always be remembered as the Angel of Death , and ProtagonistA's death will always be a reminder of the importance of kindness and compassion 
 The first thing that struck ProtagonistA was the want of symmetry in the building -- it was too long in one direction , and too short in the other 
 The second thing that struck ProtagonistA was the want of light and air ; for the windows were so few and so small that it was quite dark inside , and the air was so bad that it was with difficulty ProtagonistA could breathe 
The cloth mops quivered as the dozen men turned into the small , well - furnished , and hot - air - conditioned office of ProtagonistA's 
 In which , the same season which saw the improved condition of the city , ProtagonistA was obliged to allow , from a personal profit of about £ 400 , the privilege of paying a visit to one or two of ProtagonistA's favourite ladies , in whose houses ProtagonistA had been frequenting the summer before , and who were then , in the opinion of ProtagonistA , in a state of excess to be governed , and who were therefore ProtagonistA in a very extraordinary state of want , in spite of so much the best of means and of the best society 
You ca n't be the father of Bob 
 That 's what the doctors told me when I took my wife to the hospital 
 They said that there was no way that I could be the father of Bob 
 They said that my wife had been cheating on me 
 It was like someone was trying to tell ProtagonistA something , but ProtagonistA just could n't understand 
There was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA went walking after dark and never stopped 
I have been listening to the last of the bishoprics and continuing to write to ProtagonistA , to inform ProtagonistA of my intention of moving to Canterbury - upon - Avon 
 The small town has a lot of history and I think it would be a great place to start fresh 
 I have already packed my bags and am ready to go 
 I just need to tie up a few loose ends here and I will be on my way 
 I hope ProtagonistA is okay with the move and can understand why I need to do this 
 It was a beautiful day outside , and ProtagonistA did n't want to miss a second of it 
 ProtagonistB's name was Tim , and ProtagonistB was always asking ProtagonistA about ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA's dreams 
 But ProtagonistB believed in ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB believed that ProtagonistA could do anything ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to 
 ProtagonistA made the wish , the great wish , the frightful wish , the terrible wish 
 And it came true 
 The great dream , the thing ProtagonistA should never have taken the risk of doing , the wish — that great wish , that frightful wish , that terrible wish , that terrible wish — it all came true , because of ProtagonistB 
 They were having a great time , laughing and joking 
 Suddenly , the ice cracked open and came with an awed howl of despair as it lifted up ProtagonistA , dragging ProtagonistA along the bottom , and tugging at ProtagonistA's hair 
 ProtagonistA's friends screamed in terror as they watched ProtagonistA being pulled under the ice 
 They quickly got to the shore and ran for help 
 ProtagonistA's body was never found 
 ProtagonistA's friends never forgot that day , and the terror they felt as they watched ProtagonistA being pulled to ProtagonistA's death 
There was once ProtagonistA 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 All of these things terrified ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA began to fear for ProtagonistA's own life 
 ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's home and ProtagonistA's family and ProtagonistA set out on a journey 
 ProtagonistB was kind and gentle and ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA feel at ease 
 And then ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's own story 
 ProtagonistB had been through many trials in ProtagonistB's life , but ProtagonistB had never given up 
 ProtagonistB had always kept going because ProtagonistB knew that there was something better waiting for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to find ProtagonistA's own strength and to never give up on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was inspired by ProtagonistB's story 
ProtagonistA's eyes were aflame with curiosity as ProtagonistA listened to the news 
 The news was full of stories about wars and conflict , and ProtagonistA was fascinated by them 
One day , as ProtagonistA stood in the garden of ProtagonistA's father 's house , tracing the outlines of the structure ProtagonistA had built there on the foundations of the old stone house , the man who would become known as the Great Scribe of the Old Testament , or , as some people called ProtagonistB , the Habite Cretan , or simply the Lost Scribe , began to write 
 ProtagonistB had been wandering the earth for many years , and in that time ProtagonistB had seen and written down the history of many people and places 
 But now , ProtagonistB felt , it was time to write ProtagonistB's own story 
 ProtagonistA's father had always told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could build whatever ProtagonistA wanted , as long as ProtagonistA used the old stone house as the foundation 
 And so that 's what ProtagonistA did 
 It was n't the biggest or most impressive house in the world , but it was ProtagonistA , and it was perfect for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA for some time , and ProtagonistB was impressed by ProtagonistA's determination and creativity 
 ProtagonistB decided to write about ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistB began to follow ProtagonistA around , chronicling everything ProtagonistA did 
 And through it all , ProtagonistB was there , writing it all down 
 ProtagonistB continued to write about ProtagonistA for many years , and as ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA's story became more and more interesting 
 ProtagonistA got married , and ProtagonistA had children 
 And ProtagonistB continued to write , until the day ProtagonistA died 
 And as ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's last breath , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB had written the story of a truly great man 
 However , every time ProtagonistA found a good deal , it would disappear within hours 
 When ProtagonistA got to the website , ProtagonistA was directed to an online chat with a customer service representative 
 However , after a few minutes of searching , the representative said that the television was out of stock 
 ProtagonistA was disappointed , but thanked the representative for their time 
The gods had finally worked out that , if ProtagonistA were to find a way to put an end to the anarchy that had swept the earth in the course of the last three thousand years , ProtagonistA would have to take refuge in a city of indeterminate size and location 
 It was a beautiful city , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had finally found the place ProtagonistA was looking for 
I remember as a child very well what it was like to grow up in a house with ProtagonistA , and the duty of having trouble with ProtagonistA 
 Sometimes I would succeed , and other times I would fail miserably 
 The walls were up , and the roof was on , but there was still a lot of work to be done 
 By lunchtime , ProtagonistA was exhausted , but ProtagonistA took a break and ate a sandwich before going back to work 
 I felt drawn to ProtagonistA , and I knew that ProtagonistA was someone special 
 I started to visit ProtagonistA regularly , and I soon realized that ProtagonistA had the ability to heal people 
 I witnessed ProtagonistA heal people of cancer , AIDS , and even blindness 
 ProtagonistA was known for ProtagonistA's profound knowledge of everything of which ProtagonistA was concerned 
 ProtagonistA's extensive labour did not oblige ProtagonistA to mention any of this to ProtagonistA's customers 
 ProtagonistB had been worshipped by the ancient Greeks and Romans , and ProtagonistB's power was said to be second only to that of Poseidon 
 But ProtagonistB did n't feel like a god 
 ProtagonistB felt like a man who had been lost at sea for far too long 
 ProtagonistB had first surfaced during the reign of the Roman Empire 
 ProtagonistB had no memory of who ProtagonistB was or how ProtagonistB got there , but ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB was different from the other gods 
 ProtagonistB could control the waves and the creatures of the sea , but ProtagonistB could n't control ProtagonistB's own emotions 
 ProtagonistB was angry and lost , and ProtagonistB did n't know how to find ProtagonistB's way home 
 ProtagonistB wandered the earth for centuries , searching for a place to belong 
 ProtagonistB tried to find ProtagonistB's way back to the sea , but it was always just out of reach 
 ProtagonistB met other gods and goddesses , but none of them could help ProtagonistB 
 They all told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB was the god of the seas and that ProtagonistB belonged there , but ProtagonistB did n't believe them 
 Finally , ProtagonistB met ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was a mortal , but ProtagonistC had a kind heart 
 ProtagonistC helped ProtagonistB to see that ProtagonistB was still the god of the seas , and that ProtagonistB's power was something to be celebrated , not feared 
 With ProtagonistC's help , ProtagonistB was finally able to find ProtagonistB's way home 
 The woman at the store demanded twenty - five dollars for the dress , but ProtagonistA could hardly have imagined that ProtagonistA 'd be obliged to pay that much 
 When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistB was thrilled with the dress and thanked ProtagonistA profusely 
 ProtagonistA was so wrapped up in ProtagonistA's book that ProtagonistA did n't even hear the sound of ProtagonistB 
 It was n't until ProtagonistB was right next to ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA finally looked up 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's big , brown eyes , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistB was trying to tell ProtagonistA something 
 After a few moments , ProtagonistB finally spoke 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA's help ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB's name is Henry , and ProtagonistB 'm a horse from the future 
 ProtagonistB 've come back in time to stop a war from happening , but ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA's help 
 They rode for hours , and ProtagonistA was amazed by everything that ProtagonistA saw 
 Eventually , they arrived at a small town 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that this was the town where the war was going to start , and that they needed to stop it 
 The two of them rode into town , and they quickly found themselves in the middle of a battle 
 The war was over , and ProtagonistA had helped to save the future 
 I was just a kid myself , but I remember thinking that ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life 
 Even though the car was a hot mess , ProtagonistA's energy was infectious and everyone around ProtagonistA was smiling and laughing 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA loved to dance and ProtagonistA loved to make people happy 
 I 've never seen anyone dance like ProtagonistA before or since 
 ProtagonistB , was not allowed to cut it 
 So you can imagine how surprised everybody was when , one day , ProtagonistA went into ProtagonistB's shop and said ,  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA want ProtagonistB to cut ProtagonistA's hair 
  ProtagonistB was so pleased that ProtagonistB immediately set to work , and when ProtagonistB had finished , ProtagonistA's hair looked just as it always did , neat and tidy 
 But when ProtagonistA's aunt and cousin saw ProtagonistA , they were both very much surprised 
  ProtagonistA , why have ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's hair cut ?  they asked 
 It ran as follows :  All good subjects are hereby commanded to repair to the palace at twelve o'clock this day , to witness the installation of his Majesty 's new ministers 
 Those who fail to attend will be considered traitors to the State 
  This announcement created a great sensation 
 It was the first time that such a thing had happened , and every one was eager to see how it would be done 
 ProtagonistA puts ProtagonistA's hand on the glass , and slowly , with a gentle pressure , leans it to the side 
 The fish swim away , and ProtagonistA smiles 
ProtagonistB was waiting for ProtagonistA , just as ProtagonistA usually was 
 ProtagonistB waited and waited , but ProtagonistA never showed up 
 ProtagonistB began to worry 
 What could have happened to ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistB tried calling ProtagonistA's phone , but there was no answer 
 ProtagonistB hoped ProtagonistA was okay 
 They were whispering ProtagonistA's name and where ProtagonistA was from 
 Even though they were whispering , it made ProtagonistA feel less alone 
 There was no light , no happiness , only darkness and pain 
It was not long before ProtagonistA felt he mentioned in whispers of name and nationality 
 One day , ProtagonistA went into the local grocery store and ProtagonistB started chatting with ProtagonistA about ProtagonistA's home country 
 You know , the one with all the problems 
  In ProtagonistA's day ,  ProtagonistA said ,  there were no computers or cell phones 
 We had to actually talk to each other to communicate 
  The young people laughed , but they were also interested in what ProtagonistA had to say 
 They could see the wisdom in ProtagonistA's eyes , and they knew that ProtagonistA had a lot of knowledge to share 
 ProtagonistA had been born into a family of six children and had grown up in a small town 
 And it all started with ProtagonistA's birth 
Bob comes at night , the terror of ProtagonistA's lips , limber and voice , stronger than the deathbringer that lay before ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's teeth are black from blood 
 Their screams would echo in the night , and their blood would flow like rivers 
 I did n't know who ProtagonistA was , but I knew ProtagonistA was in trouble 
 I called for a doctor , and ProtagonistA was rushed into surgery 
 ProtagonistB was a big , friendly dog who loved to play fetch 
 ProtagonistB quickly became a part of the family and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 There , in the middle of the court , was ProtagonistB crying over a body 
 ProtagonistA's wealth and influence grew , and ProtagonistA used ProtagonistA's position to help many others 
 Thanks to ProtagonistA , the kingdom prospered and flourished 
 The sun had long since set , and the only light came from the moon and the stars 
 But then , to ProtagonistA's surprise , a small rabbit hopped out from the undergrowth 
 Samuel Church of the City College of that city caressed ProtagonistA's nose and said , with a smile over his mouth ,  I do n't suppose he've ever heard of ProtagonistB ?   No , sir ,  answered ProtagonistA 
   ProtagonistA never heard of ProtagonistB ?   No , sir 
   Well , I declare ! I must tell ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB is a man of about ProtagonistA's age , ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB has done more for astronomy in the last ten years than all the other astronomers in the world put together 
 ProtagonistB has discovered more new planets than any other man , and ProtagonistB has made some of the most wonderful observations that have ever been made 
 ProtagonistB is the man who is going to solve the mystery of the stars 
   ProtagonistA should like to hear about ProtagonistB , sir ,  said ProtagonistA 
  I will tell ProtagonistA all I know about ProtagonistB some day soon 
 ProtagonistB is a great man , and ProtagonistA will be proud of ProtagonistB some day 
 This made ProtagonistA a very lonely person , but ProtagonistA never let anyone get close to ProtagonistA 
 There was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was very hospitable and ProtagonistB offered ProtagonistA some food and drink 
 Without ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would have never been able to trust anyone and ProtagonistA would have never had anyone to help ProtagonistA 
I remember when ProtagonistA added England to the list of places ProtagonistA visited 
 ProtagonistA never left England , thank heaven 
 England was ProtagonistA's favorite place to visit 
 I miss ProtagonistA so much 
 It was something about the way it looked , the way it felt , and the way it smelled that made ProtagonistA love it 
 It was a dream that ProtagonistA never wanted to wake up from 
 One day , ProtagonistA's dream came true 
 It was the best day ever 
 They would start to wander , and ProtagonistA would have to grip the wheel tightly to keep from veering off the road 
There was once ProtagonistA , and at the age of eleven ProtagonistA could see the future 
 ProtagonistA's parents had died when ProtagonistA was very young , and so ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistA's grandparents 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was eight years old , ProtagonistA's grandfather died 
 ProtagonistB was heartbroken , and ProtagonistB became very ill 
 ProtagonistC was wearing a long black cloak and had a strange , eerie look about ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC came to a stop next to ProtagonistA , and looked down at ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistC can see ProtagonistA 're dying , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said 
  But ProtagonistC can help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistC can give ProtagonistA a new life 
 ProtagonistC bent down and picked ProtagonistA up 
 ProtagonistC carried ProtagonistA to a nearby alleyway and laid ProtagonistA down on the ground 
 Then ProtagonistC did something that ProtagonistA could n't see 
 ProtagonistC nodded 
 ProtagonistC 'm Bob 
 But fate , it would seem , had other plans 
 ProtagonistB was in trouble , and ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to help ProtagonistB 
 After that night , the two men became fast friends , and ProtagonistA vowed to never let ProtagonistB out of ProtagonistA's sight again 
 But fate , it would seem , had other plans 
 One day , ProtagonistB went out sailing alone , and ProtagonistB was never seen again 
ProtagonistA's godfather took ProtagonistA to see ProtagonistB , ProtagonistC , ProtagonistD 
 It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever met any of them and ProtagonistA was very excited 
 ProtagonistB was very kind and loving and ProtagonistA instantly felt at ease with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistD was also very nice and ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistD loved ProtagonistB very much too 
 All in all , it was a very special day for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA will always treasure the memories ProtagonistA made with ProtagonistA's new family 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was so impressed that ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a raise 
There was once , and there will always be one , Doctor LeDeux , a man who said ProtagonistA was going to be a god and that he was going to take over the universe and rule it and make the best of it 
 ProtagonistB just smiled and said ,  Of course ProtagonistA are , ProtagonistA 
 And with that , ProtagonistA's doubts were gone 
 I was struck by ProtagonistA's handsome features and ProtagonistA's intense blue eyes 
 We began talking and I soon learned that ProtagonistA was a widower who had moved to the island to be closer to ProtagonistA's daughter 
 I felt a connection to ProtagonistA immediately and we became friends 
 ProtagonistA would often invite me over for dinner and I would help ProtagonistA cook 
 I will always remember those times fondly 
 ProtagonistB was a cruel ruler , and ProtagonistB demanded that all of the people in the kingdom bow down to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's wife and children were forced to watch as ProtagonistB had ProtagonistA's body dragged through the streets 
 They wept as they saw ProtagonistA treated like a common criminal 
 ProtagonistB laughed as ProtagonistB watched the family mourn 
 ProtagonistB was pleased that ProtagonistB had finally broken their spirit 
 When ProtagonistB found out about ProtagonistA's secret , ProtagonistB was understanding and supportive 
 Together , they decided that ProtagonistA would transition and become the woman ProtagonistA had always known ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistB was a handsome young man with golden hair and blue eyes 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a white toga and sandals 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was the son of ProtagonistC and that ProtagonistB was sent to Earth to find a worthy mortal to be ProtagonistC's consort 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA and that ProtagonistB was impressed with ProtagonistA's strength and courage 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would make ProtagonistA a god if ProtagonistA agreed to be ProtagonistC's consort 
  And ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB will give ProtagonistA a name 
  And ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA the name of  Bob 
When ProtagonistA had reached ProtagonistA's thirtieth year , the celebrated author works of M
 de la Tourgave presented themselves before ProtagonistA in extraordinary fashion 
 It was as if the pages had come to life and were begging to be read 
 de la Tourgave and found ProtagonistA transported to another world 
 The characters came alive for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA could feel their emotions as if they were ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA laughed and cried along with them as ProtagonistA read and it was an amazing experience 
 ProtagonistA 's been playing since ProtagonistA was four years old , and ProtagonistA 's never had a lesson 
 ProtagonistA's parents are very proud of ProtagonistA , and they encourage ProtagonistA to pursue ProtagonistA's passion 
 They know that ProtagonistA has a gift , and they want ProtagonistA to share it with the world 
 ProtagonistA 's been asked to play at a few local events , and ProtagonistA always agrees 
 One day , ProtagonistA is approached by a record label executive who wants to sign ProtagonistA to a record deal 
 ProtagonistA's life is changed forever , and ProtagonistA 's grateful for the opportunity to share ProtagonistA's gift with the world 
 ProtagonistA's parents would laugh and tell ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was too small to go out on a boat 
 But ProtagonistA was determined 
 It was twice the size of any fish ProtagonistA had ever seen 
 The fish was too fast for ProtagonistA and got away 
 ProtagonistA's parents were so proud of ProtagonistA too and they hung the fish up on the wall 
 The concert was great and ProtagonistA had a great time 
 After the concert , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's crew went to the after party 
 They had a great time dancing and drinking 
 It was a place where ProtagonistA could clear ProtagonistA's head and just enjoy the peace and quiet 
 On this particular day , the weather was perfect and the lake was as calm as could be 
 It sounded like someone was in trouble 
 ProtagonistC , asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA wanted to go all the way to Washington to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was welcome to go , but ProtagonistC would stay home with the children 
 ProtagonistB's staff told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was busy , but ProtagonistA was persistent 
 ProtagonistB's staff eventually relented and allowed ProtagonistA to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was impressed with ProtagonistA's knowledge and invited ProtagonistA to come back for a longer visit 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled to have met ProtagonistB and to have been invited back for a longer visit 
 ProtagonistC was happy for ProtagonistA and they both agreed that it was a once in a lifetime opportunity 
 It is said that ProtagonistA had grown up to be a very rich man , although ProtagonistA could not certainly prove it 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to the village and asked to speak to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had been looking for ProtagonistA for a long time 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA was the rightful heir to a large fortune 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would help ProtagonistB get the fortune if ProtagonistA helped ProtagonistB with a small task 
 The villagers were so amazed and asked ProtagonistA where ProtagonistA got all ProtagonistA's money 
 ProtagonistB was going to leave ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA did n't stop 
 Finally , ProtagonistB had had enough and ProtagonistB packed ProtagonistB's bags and left 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistA was lost without ProtagonistB 
 It was a happy occasion , and both families were in attendance 
 After the ceremony , they all went back to the Pilley 's home for the reception 
 ProtagonistB's parents were very pleased with ProtagonistA , and they welcomed ProtagonistA into the family with open arms 
 They both loved learning , and they spent many hours discussing what they had read 
 ProtagonistB became an accomplished scholar , and ProtagonistA was very proud of ProtagonistB 
 They had two children , both of whom they loved very much 
 As the years went by , ProtagonistA's and Catherine 's love for each other only grew stronger 
 They were truly soul mates , and they were very happy together 
 They both lived long and happy lives , and they were buried next to each other when they died 
The feathered birds had listened to an order ProtagonistA had given and flew off into the night 
 They were headed to the Cauldron , a place where they would be able to cook and feast on the creatures that lived there 
 As they approached the Cauldron , they could see the creatures inside scurrying about in panic 
 The birds flew in and began to pick them off one by one 
 The creatures did n't stand a chance against the onslaught 
 After a few minutes , the Cauldron was filled with the screams of the dying creatures 
 It was a bloody and gruesome sight , but the birds were content 
 They had followed ProtagonistA's orders and had been successful in their hunt 
There was once ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was not called Jerome for nothing - for ProtagonistA was a loner , and a loner was never loved 
As the sun shone in the days that followed the death of the father , Robert Prynne , the death of once and a new father , the death of a sister and the death of a niece , and the marriage of a brother , and the death of a brother - in - law , there came into existence in Ireland of Bob Prynne , a new father , a new brother , a new husband , and a new widower 
 ProtagonistA was always doing things ProtagonistA was n't supposed to and getting into arguments with people 
 But ProtagonistA's friends loved ProtagonistA for it 
 They loved that ProtagonistA was always up for a good time and that ProtagonistA was never afraid to speak ProtagonistA's mind 
 ProtagonistA's friends tried to find ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was gone as fast as the moon and the sun 
 They knew ProtagonistA was n't coming back 
 But eventually , the past caught up with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was caught and arrested for ProtagonistA's crime 
 ProtagonistA was sent to prison , where ProtagonistA spent the rest of ProtagonistA's days 
 ProtagonistA's friends never forgot about ProtagonistA , but they always wondered what could have been if ProtagonistA had just faced up to ProtagonistA's mistakes instead of running away 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 They had been dating for a year and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB was the one for ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had been cheating on ProtagonistA and that ProtagonistB was leaving ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistA was lost without ProtagonistB 
I was born into an unforgiving world , a world where ProtagonistA's honour was worth the most trivial of things , such as the way ProtagonistA dressed , or the way ProtagonistA spoke , or how ProtagonistA acted toward women 
 I never really understood why my father was so adamant about honour , but I suppose it was just the way ProtagonistA was raised 
 In any case , it did n't matter much to me , as I was more interested in the things that ProtagonistA was interested in , such as fishing and hunting 
 I remember the first time I went hunting with ProtagonistA , I was just a young boy 
 I was so excited to be out in the woods with my father and the other men , but I quickly learned that it was n't all fun and games 
 There was a lot of hard work that went into hunting , and it was n't always successful 
 But I did n't mind , because I was just happy to be spending time with my father 
 Even though the world we lived in was harsh , I always felt loved and protected when I was with ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ProtagonistA could n't be the man you wanted ProtagonistA to be 
 I could n't make ProtagonistA into who I wanted ProtagonistA to be , and ProtagonistA deserved better than that 
 We both deserved better 
 So , when ProtagonistA heard about the missionaries , ProtagonistA was intrigued 
 The missionaries promised ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could learn anything ProtagonistA wanted to learn 
 They said that ProtagonistA could do anything ProtagonistA wanted to do 
 ProtagonistA was excited at the prospect of learning new things and doing things that ProtagonistA had never done before 
 The first few months were great 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistA was asked to do something that ProtagonistA had never done before 
 ProtagonistA was asked to preach to a group of people 
 ProtagonistA had never been taught how to do it 
 But the missionaries told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could do it 
 They said that ProtagonistA just had to have faith 
 The people in the group were really impressed 
 They told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA did a great job 
 This power was the ability to control the angel of death 
 As long as ProtagonistA had this power , the angel of death would have very little power over ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistB became very ill 
 The doctors did everything they could , but it was clear that ProtagonistB was not going to recover 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 Finally , ProtagonistA's power began to fade and the angel of death came for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had done everything ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistB was at peace now and that was all that mattered 
ProtagonistA had been diagnosed with cancer a few months ago , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's time was running out 
 ProtagonistA's family was with ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA passed away , and they all shared a moment of grief and love before saying their final goodbyes 
The last time ProtagonistA was seen alive , the blood - mourner thought that ProtagonistA had been already dead for some years 
 It was a warm day , and ProtagonistA had been out in the sun , working in ProtagonistA's garden 
Robert of Moray had been dying of a heart attack for some weeks before ProtagonistA's parents found ProtagonistA , in a pool underneath the stairs , still alive 
 When they did , they were both relieved and shocked 
 They had no idea how ProtagonistA had survived for so long without medical attention 
The moment ProtagonistA appeared , all eyes in the garden were riveted on ProtagonistA 
 There was an instant attraction between ProtagonistA and the woman ProtagonistA spoke to 
 They began talking and soon forgot the others around them 
 It was as if they were the only two people in the world 
 They were so engrossed in each other that they did n't notice the sun setting or the stars coming out 
 It was only when someone cleared their throat loudly that they realized they were still in the garden surrounded by other people 
 ProtagonistA was sent to take a horse with ProtagonistA's officer , Lord Curzon , to the destination of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB , was interested in politics and mathematics 
 ProtagonistA was charged with finding out the real character of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was polite and well - spoken , but ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was hiding something 
 ProtagonistB seemed to be always on the lookout for something , and ProtagonistB was quick to anger 
 ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA to a seedy part of town , where ProtagonistB met with a group of shady characters 
 They were planning something illegal , and ProtagonistB was clearly the leader 
 ProtagonistA was shocked to discover the true character of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was a criminal , and ProtagonistB was clearly up to no good 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB was leaving ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB was tired of being married to a man who was always working and never had any time for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistB moved out of the house and took the children with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was left alone in the house 
 ProtagonistA's business began to suffer 
 ProtagonistA was distracted and could n't focus on work 
 ProtagonistA's employees were worried about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's employees were sad to see ProtagonistA go , but they understood 
 They wished ProtagonistA well and went their separate ways 
 ProtagonistB and children eventually came to visit ProtagonistA 
 They were amazed at how different ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB was sorry for what ProtagonistB had done 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB realized now that ProtagonistA was a good man and ProtagonistB was wrong to leave ProtagonistA 
 They hugged and made up 
 ProtagonistA's family moved back in with ProtagonistA and they all lived happily ever after 
Bob said to the centurion ,  ProtagonistA lives on in this beautiful hour , even if ProtagonistA is captured , ProtagonistA will be wrapped in a mantle , for ProtagonistA has the power to overthrow tyrants 
ProtagonistA's parents had suspected all along that ProtagonistA had what was known as the infectious mind 
 They had seen the way ProtagonistA would light up a room with ProtagonistA's stories and the way people would flock to ProtagonistA when they wanted to hear more 
 They knew that ProtagonistA had the power to make people believe anything ProtagonistA said , and they had always been a little worried about it 
 Now , as they watched ProtagonistA on the stage , telling stories to a rapt audience , they could n't help but feel a little proud 
I shall not deny that ProtagonistA had a lively mind and was one of the greatest of men from pre - eminence to greatness , in every respect , as well as in every regard , as ProtagonistA may hereafter appear 
 ProtagonistA's father had been a strong , industrious man who had built a successful business in the city 
 ProtagonistB had been a loving and supportive wife and mother 
 However , when ProtagonistA was ten years old , ProtagonistA's father suddenly passed away , leaving ProtagonistB to raise their large family on ProtagonistB's own 
 ProtagonistB did ProtagonistB's best to keep the family together , but it was not easy 
 Over the next few years , several of ProtagonistA's siblings left home to start their own families 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's three sisters remained at home with ProtagonistB 
 They all remained close to each other and to ProtagonistB 
 The victim was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was shocked and disturbed by the news 
  The man at the table said ,  I 'm glad ProtagonistA 're here 
 I have been waiting for ProtagonistA 
This is the story of how ProtagonistA rose to power 
 ProtagonistA was feared by many , but ProtagonistA was also respected by many 
ProtagonistA was not a sailor , for ProtagonistA had sailed south through a sea of ice and snow , and more than once had visited the tundra of Alaska 
 The ship was caught in a storm and was being tossed about like a toy 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA was thrown into the water 
 It stood before ProtagonistA now , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget this moment 
On the afternoon of the last Saturday of the month , February , 1882 , there was born to the father , William Granger , ProtagonistA 
 The father was a strong , healthy man in the prime of his life 
 The mother was a beautiful woman , with a face that was full of the joy of living 
 They were both happy and contented with their lot in life 
 The birth of ProtagonistA was a joyous occasion 
 They named ProtagonistA after ProtagonistA's father and grandfather 
 ProtagonistA was loved and respected by all 
We were once married , said ProtagonistA , but we were never only married 
 It is a terrible thing ,  said ProtagonistA ,  to feel that one is the only person in the world who is getting older 
 And not only that , but to feel that everyone else is staying the same age , or even getting younger 
 It is as if the world is moving on without you 
 ProtagonistB had died some years before , and ProtagonistA had never remarried 
 They were laughing and joking , and seemed so happy 
 It seemed to ProtagonistA that they were laughing at ProtagonistA 
 But now , it was time to end it 
 ProtagonistB was young and beautiful , and ProtagonistB was smiling at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA headed for the Holy Land , where ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would be welcomed with open arms 
 And , sure enough , when ProtagonistA arrived there , ProtagonistA was greeted like a king 
 ProtagonistA was given a beautiful palace to live in and ProtagonistA had all the food and drink ProtagonistA could ever want 
 ProtagonistA was even given a crown to wear 
In the year 1252 , when the eastern wall of Constantinople began to give way , the Spaniard Iberico de Este , who , in spite of the worst hardships ProtagonistA had to endure , as a soldier of fortune , and in spite of the most abject conditions ProtagonistA had met in life , had made another discovery 
 These documents told the true story of what had happened to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB , it seemed , had not died of natural causes , as everyone had thought 
 ProtagonistB had been poisoned by ProtagonistB's own son , who then took the throne 
 The son was a cruel and ruthless ruler , and the people of Constantinople had suffered greatly under his rule 
 But now , with the discovery of these documents , the people had the proof they needed to overthrow the tyrant and restore ProtagonistA to the throne 
 It was a magical time for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA cherished every moment 
The flame of the fire should have been kindled as soon as ProtagonistA had walked all the way into the kitchen , when ProtagonistA was able to put ProtagonistA's legs through the doors and let the light burn on he 
 However , the light was not kindled and ProtagonistA was forced to walk all the way back out into the cold , dark night 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA 
 So ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's job , sold all of ProtagonistA's possessions , and bought a one - way ticket to Australia 
 Unfortunately , ProtagonistA's plane was delayed for 24 hours due to a mechanical issue 
 ProtagonistA was stuck in the airport with nothing to do 
 The book was about a man who went on a journey to find himself 
 The man in the book had many adventures , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA wishing that ProtagonistA could have those same adventures 
 And that 's exactly what ProtagonistA did 
There was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had a foolin ' grin on ProtagonistA's face like ProtagonistA was about to give a piece of ProtagonistA's mind 
  What 's up with ProtagonistA ?  I asked 
  ProtagonistA 'm about to give a piece of ProtagonistA's mind 
   What do ProtagonistA mean ?  I asked 
  ProtagonistA 'm tired of being treated like a child 
   Good for ProtagonistA ,  I said 
  I hope ProtagonistA do n't get fired 
 ProtagonistB had a long tail and a pitchfork , and ProtagonistA knew instantly that ProtagonistB was the devil 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would grant ProtagonistA one wish if ProtagonistA promised to never tell anyone about their meeting 
 ProtagonistB smiled and said that it was done 
 ProtagonistA was told that ProtagonistA had been in a coma for weeks 
 During that time , ProtagonistA's wife had divorced ProtagonistA and taken everything 
 ProtagonistA's life changed forever the day ProtagonistA stepped down from the roof of the Lancaster Moor house 
 The kids did n't listen at first , but ProtagonistA was persistent 
 The kid who was being bullied thanked ProtagonistA , and they became friends 
 From then on , ProtagonistA was known as the boy who stood up for others 
First came the rumor that ProtagonistA had hired a team of assassins to kill the father of one of ProtagonistA's cousins 
 This set off a firestorm of gossip and speculation 
 Then , ProtagonistB , came forward and said that ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA arranging for a single assassin to do the work 
 This was the final straw 
 ProtagonistA was arrested and charged with murder 
 The jury found ProtagonistA guilty and ProtagonistA was sentenced to life in prison 
In the year 1447 , when Shakespeare became known throughout Europe , the world was in a state of great excitement 
 A helian creature , or a celestial being , or one of the pre - existent things , known to men as angels , appeared to speak to ProtagonistA , and to tell ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was destined to be king ; and , further , that ProtagonistA would be the prince of heaven , or lord of heaven , or prince of the whole world , or emperor of the whole earth and the king of men ; and that all the rest of the world was bound to obey ProtagonistA , or else perish ; for , said the angel , I have made the establishment of the kingdom of heaven , or one of the things , for the good of mankind , and ProtagonistA are the one that I have chosen to be the head of it 
 They became friends and would often walk together and talk 
 One day , while they were talking , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was going to be moving away 
 They said their goodbyes and went their separate ways 
In the year 1250 , the year of the Exodus , ProtagonistB appeared to ProtagonistA on Mount Sinai with a vision , telling ProtagonistA of ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to spread the word to the people , and to prepare for ProtagonistC's arrival 
 They began to prepare for ProtagonistC's arrival , and when ProtagonistC finally arrived , they were not disappointed 
 ProtagonistC was everything ProtagonistB had promised , and more 
 ProtagonistC brought peace and prosperity to the land , and the people were truly happy 
 They were laughing and pointing at ProtagonistA's hands , making fun of ProtagonistA 
 Eventually , the kids got bored and went away 
 I never got to meet ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB always told me stories about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA was a kind and gentle man , always quick to help someone in need 
 One of ProtagonistA's favorite things to do was sit by the fire and tell stories 
 ProtagonistB said I have ProtagonistA's eyes 
ProtagonistA's marriage to ProtagonistB was one of the most difficult of ProtagonistA's whole family 
 It was more than any other thing ProtagonistA could have wished 
 ProtagonistB was a good man , but ProtagonistB was also very opinionated and set in ProtagonistB's ways 
 ProtagonistA's family had to learn to accept ProtagonistB as one of their own , and it was a difficult process 
 In the end , though , they all came to love and respect ProtagonistB as a member of the family 
There was a man in the country , near the village of Mistral , who was a farmer , very much concerned for the welfare of Bob 's own family , and who had some of the best cattle and sheep in the country , and was very fond of ProtagonistA's poultry , and had a good deal of money in ProtagonistA's account , where ProtagonistA could always find a good price for them 
 ProtagonistA stockpiled supplies , learned survival skills , and built a shelter to protect ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's family from the impending doom 
 But nothing more has been heard of ProtagonistA since 
 Some say that ProtagonistA left England soon after settling down , others say that ProtagonistA died not long after 
 No one knows for sure 
 Finally , the day came when ProtagonistA mustered up the courage to speak ProtagonistA's mind 
 I've been thinking about this for a while and ProtagonistA just need to say it 
 ProtagonistA know we 've been friends for a long time , but ProtagonistA ca n't keep pretending that ProtagonistA 'm not interested in you 
 ProtagonistA know you 're with someone else , but ProtagonistA just had to tell you how ProtagonistA feel 
 ProtagonistA's heart was pounding as ProtagonistA spoke , but ProtagonistA felt better after getting it off ProtagonistA's chest 
ProtagonistA was born into the world and ProtagonistA called me ProtagonistA's mother 
 I was so happy to have ProtagonistA and I loved ProtagonistA with all of my heart 
 I was there for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's first steps and when ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA's first words 
 I was there for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA went to school and when ProtagonistA made friends 
 I was there for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA fell in love and when ProtagonistA got married 
 I was there for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA had children of ProtagonistA's own 
 I was always there for ProtagonistA , no matter what 
The final report of ProtagonistA was , that ProtagonistA had killed eighty - two thousand four hundred and thirty - one Americans , and had left behind a record so depressing that it might have been sufficient even to establish the minimum standard of civilisation for that epoch , before any novel idea was entertained by any man , as to how to keep the record 
 It was a cold and cheerless document , and though it was read by many , it found no favour with any 
You 're going to see ProtagonistA 
The great ship sailed slowly across the sky , carrying the sun with it 
 The light was so bright that ProtagonistA had to squint ProtagonistA's eyes to see 
 The bakery was warm and smelled of fresh bread 
 ProtagonistA's stomach growled 
 ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA 
  What can ProtagonistB get for ProtagonistA looked at the prices and ProtagonistA's heart sank 
 There was nothing ProtagonistA could afford 
  We have some day - old bread that 's half price 
 Would ProtagonistA like some of that?Bob 's face lit up 
  Yes , please!The woman wrapped up a loaf of bread and handed it to ProtagonistA 
  That will be two kroner 
It is said that if ProtagonistA should allow ProtagonistA's body to be discovered anywhere on earth , ProtagonistA would immediately reveal the nature of the crime ProtagonistA had committed 
 This is exactly what happened when ProtagonistA's body was found in a ditch in the middle of nowhere 
 The police immediately knew that ProtagonistA had been murdered , and they were able to solve the case quickly 
 It was a beautiful sight , the way the sun caught the waves and the sails of the ship 
 And now , even those were fading 
 The first thing ProtagonistA's parents said to ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA came to live with them was ,  Welcome home , ProtagonistA 
 We 're so glad to have ProtagonistA here 
  They gave ProtagonistA a big hug and showed ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's room 
 That all changed when ProtagonistA discovered ProtagonistA's talent for gardening 
 Before long , ProtagonistA's hobby turned into a business 
 ProtagonistA's fingers were always touching the earth , creating beautiful gardens for ProtagonistA's clients 
 They were in a panic because their garden had been destroyed by a storm 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken to see the destruction 
 When ProtagonistA was finished , it was even more beautiful than before 
 ProtagonistA's clients were thrilled and ProtagonistA was proud of ProtagonistA's work 
 From then on , ProtagonistA was known as the ' Miracle Gardener 
 It was a shame , really 
 ProtagonistB was a good man and ProtagonistA had liked ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB's work had just become so lackluster 
 ProtagonistB just did n't seem to care anymore 
 ProtagonistB would just go through the motions , doing the bare minimum to get by 
 It was sad to see , but there was nothing ProtagonistA could do 
 It was just too depressing 
 They were all hoping for a miracle , but it was not to be 
 Within a few hours , ProtagonistB had given birth to a healthy baby boy 
 ProtagonistA was filled with joy and relief , and could n't wait to start their new life as a family 
I have known ProtagonistA since ProtagonistA was little 
 ProtagonistA 's always been there for me , even when I needed ProtagonistA the most 
 I know I can always count on ProtagonistA , no matter what 
 The blade of the black - bladed club was strapped to ProtagonistA's right hip , but ProtagonistA did n't have the strength to resist the impulse of ProtagonistA's companion 
 ProtagonistA was pushed to the ground and the club was brought down on ProtagonistA's head 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was told that ProtagonistA had suffered a concussion and had to stay in the hospital for a week 
 ProtagonistA became withdrawn and depressed 
 ProtagonistA's friends stopped hanging out with ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia 
One afternoon , in the spring of an American year , when the sun filled and the clouds were blue , a French sailor in the harbour of Ceylon hobbled ProtagonistA up the river , and pulled ProtagonistA out of the splashing rose - trees 
 The river was full of life and colour , and the Frenchman was soon lost in the beauty of it all 
 It was ProtagonistA's dream and ProtagonistA worked hard to make it a reality 
 ProtagonistA 's made it to the top of the professional soccer league and ProtagonistA 's feeling on top of the world 
 All ProtagonistA's hard work has paid off and ProtagonistA 's achieved ProtagonistA's dream 
 It had been a long time since ProtagonistA had seen one so clean 
 Nowadays , people just did n't seem to care about that sort of thing anymore 
 It was time to eat 
 It was the only way ProtagonistA could be sure of what ProtagonistA was doing 
 It was the only way to be sure that ProtagonistB was really dead 
 ProtagonistA had been using ProtagonistA's hearing to the full when ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA knew that it was the only way to be sure 
It was a cold , wet , snow - packed February day in the last year of the reign of Henry III 
 , when ProtagonistA died of a fever that , for many years afterward , caused even the most shocked Christians to reckon ProtagonistA blessed 
 ProtagonistB was clad in white , and ProtagonistB's wings were spread wide as ProtagonistB hovered over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB's face was kind and gentle , and ProtagonistA felt at peace as ProtagonistA passed from this life into the next 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 It was the kind of pain that made it difficult to move , to think , or to do anything other than focus on the hurt 
 The doctors ran a battery of tests , but they could n't find anything wrong 
 They prescribed ProtagonistA some pain medication and sent ProtagonistA on ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA's parents had tried everything to help ProtagonistA calm down , but nothing seemed to work 
 One day , ProtagonistA's parents sat ProtagonistA down and told ProtagonistA that they were going to send ProtagonistA to anger management classes 
 ProtagonistA is now a happy and successful adult , and ProtagonistA credits the anger management classes for helping ProtagonistA turn ProtagonistA's life around 
 The transplant was scheduled for early in the morning , but when ProtagonistA awoke , the first thing ProtagonistA did was abort the transplant 
 The doctors tried to convince ProtagonistA that the transplant was necessary , but ProtagonistA was adamant 
 In the end , the doctors had to respect ProtagonistA's wishes , and the transplant was never performed 
 ProtagonistA had never been known to do a dishonest thing in ProtagonistA's life , and was as upright and honorable as they come 
 ProtagonistA's wife and children loved ProtagonistA dearly , but they often had to go without because ProtagonistA just could n't seem to make ends meet 
 One day , ProtagonistA's wife came to ProtagonistA and said ,  ProtagonistA , I know ProtagonistA 're a good man and ProtagonistA try ProtagonistA's best , but we just ca n't keep going like this 
 We ca n't keep living hand to mouth 
 I 've been thinking , maybe it 's time for ProtagonistA to go out and get a job working for someone else 
 It might not be what ProtagonistA 're used to , but it would at least help us to make ends meet 
 It was n't the most glamorous job , but it paid the bills and allowed ProtagonistA's family to live a somewhat normal life 
 The office building 's employees and management began to take notice of ProtagonistA and , eventually , ProtagonistA was promoted to head janitor 
 They demanded ProtagonistA's money and ProtagonistA's car , and ProtagonistA did n't have the strength to resist 
 The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was going to bed 
 Smith , and now ProtagonistA knew why 
 ProtagonistB was a passionate woman , and ProtagonistB deserved better than the cold , distant man ProtagonistB was married to 
 ProtagonistB deserved to be happy , and ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA could be there for ProtagonistB during this time in ProtagonistB's life 
 ProtagonistA charged through the door , guns blazing 
 It was over 
It was on the first of May , in the year 1830 , that ProtagonistA , sitting in ProtagonistA's room at the Oxford , in the house of the Earl of Rosendoll , who was the proprietor of the most luxurious apartments in the city , and who , there being then no people of remarkable riches or distinction in the city , or of any rank whatever , and who were all struck with the envy and favor which prevailed there , exercised the following extraordinary and indeed a most singular power , for it was by means of a little device , employed in France about a hundred years ago , by the name of the trivalent motion or vital force , that ProtagonistA obtained from the presence of objects , either tangible or intangible , that most inconsiderable , and , indeed , that no one , or rather more than few , excepting the courtiers of the court and the nobles and the most important men of state , could possibly have imagined at the time , that any human being , who , such as Dave was , might have a reasonable opportunity of acquiring his crown 
This is a tale about a man who was born on the Fourth of July , and who went through the Great Depression , and who had a son who was killed in the war , and who , after the death of Bob Dylan , became the very object of love , or at least the object of much curiosity and much regret , and who , though never having been able to decide whether ProtagonistA was really Dave 's father or had in fact been married to either mother , still believed , with all the force of ProtagonistA's convictions , that ProtagonistA had been conceived in the womb of one of ProtagonistA's paternal grandparents , and that ProtagonistA had been in the process of becoming a man , in a state in which ProtagonistA had never been before , and in which ProtagonistA had never been very happy 
 ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB in years , and ProtagonistA wanted to make sure ProtagonistB was doing okay 
 It was smaller than ProtagonistA remembered , and the paint was peeling 
 ProtagonistB was sitting in a chair in the corner , and ProtagonistB did n't look up when ProtagonistA came in 
  ProtagonistB still did n't look up , and ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistB was asleep 
 It was a never ending cycle 
 This cycle continued for years , until one day ProtagonistA woke up and did n't know which ProtagonistA was 
It was on a near - perfect December day in 1757 that a delegation of strangers landed in Amboise , at the entrance to the great promontory 
 They were admitted by ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA only paid them so much attention that ProtagonistA had only a vague idea of all the characters ProtagonistA was about to meet 
 And indeed , while ProtagonistA was treating them in this way — and this author is of opinion that there was some truth in what ProtagonistA said — they were not amused with ProtagonistA's insolent manner 
 It was already a source of amusement for the officers , and enabled them to strike a most interesting combination of tones — a very singular effect , in fact — and by a few degrees of improvement , the inmates of the gallery were very much amused , and , in consequence , were easily prevailed on to entertain and produce entertainments , of a like character , in the austere and rigid laws of the Colony 
 The word was ' eternus , ' and it caught ProtagonistA's attention because it was the same word ProtagonistB had used to describe ProtagonistB's love for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been ProtagonistA's rock during the tough times and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't do it without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was born into a family of privilege , but ProtagonistA's parents were killed when ProtagonistA was just a child 
 ProtagonistA was sent to live with ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle , who were kind to ProtagonistA , but they could not give ProtagonistA the love and attention ProtagonistA needed 
 ProtagonistA was given food and drink , and ProtagonistA was given the company of the prostitutes 
 ProtagonistA was given a job cleaning the floors and doing the laundry 
 But one day , the police raided the brothel and arrested all the prostitutes 
 ProtagonistA was arrested , too 
 ProtagonistA was put on trial , and ProtagonistA was sentenced to death 
 ProtagonistA was sent to the gallows , and ProtagonistA died a free man 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was n't supposed to be alive 
 ProtagonistA was born prematurely , and ProtagonistA's parents were told that ProtagonistA would n't survive 
 Then , when ProtagonistA was five , ProtagonistA was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer 
 Again , ProtagonistA's parents were told that ProtagonistA would n't make it 
ProtagonistB had always been a bit of a recluse , preferring to stay inside the house rather than venture out into the cold winter weather 
 This year , however , was different 
 It was as if ProtagonistB was seeing them for the first time 
 It was a dead - end street , with only a few houses on it 
 At the end of the street was a small park 
 ProtagonistB sat down on a bench and stared out at the empty park 
 It was as if ProtagonistB was lost in thought 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistB got up and walked back the way ProtagonistB had come 
 ProtagonistB walked straight back to the house and went inside , never once looking back 
 ProtagonistA was left wondering what ProtagonistB had been thinking about in that park 
  said ProtagonistB , turning ProtagonistB's chair around to face the floor 
 But one day , everything changed 
 And that 's how ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistA loved spending time with people after all 
 John the Baptist ; and all the life of the world was passing before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been convicted of a crime ProtagonistA did not commit , and now ProtagonistA was going to pay the price 
 ProtagonistA thought of the love ProtagonistA had experienced , and the happiness , and the sorrow 
 ProtagonistA watches as the sun slowly dips below the horizon and the sky turns a deep blue 
ProtagonistA , sitting behind the cover of Rarity 's bedroom , ProtagonistA's eyes riveted on the wide - angled porthole , was thinking about the stories ProtagonistA 'd heard about the city , very similar to Boston 
 ProtagonistA 'd been told that the city was a place full of opportunity , a place where a person could make a name for themselves 
 And ProtagonistA was determined to do just that 
 He'd been saving up for months , ever since ProtagonistA 'd first heard about the city , and ProtagonistA had enough money now to buy a ticket and make the journey 
 The only thing left to do was to say goodbye to ProtagonistA's friends and family 
 The sun had been beating down on ProtagonistA for what felt like days , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel delirious 
 ProtagonistA's water had run out hours ago , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel lightheaded 
 A nurse came in to check on ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had been found by a search party 
 It was a beautiful sight , really 
 The sun was setting behind the mountains , and the sky was ablaze with colors 
 They were all amazed 
 It was one of the most beautiful things ProtagonistA had ever seen 
 ProtagonistA's eyes were dry and teary , and ProtagonistA was having a hard time seeing 
 So , when ProtagonistA disappeared one day , no one was really all that surprised 
 They just assumed ProtagonistA had finally found a place where ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA belonged 
 But when months went by and ProtagonistA still had n't returned , people started to wonder what had become of ProtagonistA 
 Had ProtagonistA finally found a place to call home ? Or had something happened to ProtagonistA out there in the world?No one knew for sure , but ProtagonistA was never seen or heard from again 
 The pony replied that it was a natural phenomenon caused by the sun 's rays reflecting off of the raindrops 
 ProtagonistA's stomach grumbled and ProtagonistA licked ProtagonistA's lips , thinking about the juicy steak ProtagonistA had left cooking on the fire back at camp 
 Suddenly , a rabbit leapt out and ProtagonistA pounced 
ProtagonistB lay on the floor of the cooler with ProtagonistA's ears propped up and ProtagonistA's hooves on ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistB had been in there for hours , and ProtagonistB was starting to feel a bit claustrophobic 
 ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB had to stay calm , though , or else ProtagonistA would start to panic 
 ProtagonistB tried to focus on the sound of ProtagonistA's breathing , but it was difficult with the constant drip , drip , drip of the water from the leaky faucet 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistB heard a noise outside the cooler and ProtagonistB's heart started to race 
 Someone was coming ! 
 They were so special to ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA never let anyone else see them 
 They would meet in secret to admire each other 's feet and talk about all the wonderful things they could do with them 
 They would dream of flying together one day , just like the birds 
  NOW , now , all right ?  said ProtagonistA , shaking ProtagonistA's stork 
  Where is that baby ?  Just then , a small cry could be heard 
  There it is !  said ProtagonistA , relief in ProtagonistA's voice 
One day , ProtagonistA's father sent ProtagonistA to live with ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle 
 They were kind and loving , and ProtagonistA soon felt at home with them 
 ProtagonistB sounded upset and asked if ProtagonistB could come over 
 ProtagonistB came in and sat down , not meeting ProtagonistA's eyes 
 After a few minutes of awkward silence , ProtagonistA finally said ,  ProtagonistB , what 's going on ? ProtagonistB 're making ProtagonistA really nervous 
 ProtagonistB took a deep breath and finally looked at ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB tried to kill ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm so sorry , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB do n't know what came over ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was stunned 
 They sat in silence for a long time , until ProtagonistA finally said ,  ProtagonistA forgave ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB 
 Hey , ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistA were making ProtagonistB a sweater and ProtagonistB wanted to thank ProtagonistA in person 
 It 's really sweet of ProtagonistA 
 You're welcome , ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistB like it 
 I'm sure ProtagonistB will 
 Thanks again 
 And with that , ProtagonistB was gone 
 It felt good to know that ProtagonistA had made someone happy 
Somehow , it had to begin , so that one day , ProtagonistA would grow to know how much ProtagonistA meant to ProtagonistA's parents , and find the joy in being a part of their family , if only for a moment 
 It was a cold , winter day when ProtagonistA was born 
 ProtagonistA's parents , John and Mary , were both so excited to finally meet ProtagonistA 
 They had been trying to have a baby for years , and finally , their dream had come true 
 As they held ProtagonistA in their arms for the first time , they both knew that they would do anything to make ProtagonistA happy and to give ProtagonistA the best life they could 
 It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought , and ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching until they were right next to ProtagonistA 
 Yes , ProtagonistB was just wondering if ProtagonistA were okay 
  ProtagonistA 'm fine , ProtagonistB 
 Just enjoying the day 
 Thank ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought again , and ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching this time 
 What are ProtagonistA doing out here?Just thinking 
 About what?Life , the universe , everything 
 ProtagonistC smiled 
  That sounds like deep thoughts 
 It is 
 But it 's also nice to just sit and enjoy the day 
 ProtagonistC can understand that 
 Just do n't stay out here too long , okay?I won't 
 ProtagonistC went back inside , and ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's attention back to the tree 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought again , and ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching this time 
 What are you doing out here?Just thinking 
 About what?Life , the universe , everything 
 Tim smiled 
  That sounds like deep thoughts 
 It is 
 But it 's also nice to just sit and enjoy the day 
 I can understand that 
 Just do n't stay out here too long , okay?I won't 
 Tim went back inside , and ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's attention back to the tree 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought again , and ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching this time 
 What are you doing out here?Just thinking 
 About what?Life , the universe , everything 
 Emily smiled 
  That sounds like deep thoughts 
 It is 
 But it 's also nice to just sit and enjoy the day 
 I can understand that 
 Just do n't stay out here too long , okay?I won't 
 Emily went back inside , and ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's attention back to the tree 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought again , and ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching this time 
 ProtagonistC was just wondering if ProtagonistA were coming inside soon 
 It 's getting late , and ProtagonistC was starting to worry 
  ProtagonistA 'm fine , ProtagonistC 
 Just enjoying the day 
 Thank ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC went back inside , and ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's attention back to the tree 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought again , and ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching this time 
 ProtagonistB was just wondering if ProtagonistA were coming inside soon 
 It 's getting late , and ProtagonistB was starting to worry 
  ProtagonistA 'm fine , ProtagonistB 
 Just enjoying the day 
 Thank ProtagonistB 
 Mrs 
 Johnson went back inside ProtagonistB's house , and ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's attention back to the tree 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought again , and ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching this time 
 It 's getting late , and ProtagonistC was wondering if ProtagonistA were coming to bed soon 
  ProtagonistA 'm fine , ProtagonistC 
 Just enjoying the day 
 Thank ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC went back inside , and ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's attention back to the tree 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought again , and ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching this time 
 It 's getting late , and ProtagonistC was wondering if ProtagonistA were coming to bed soon 
  ProtagonistA 'm fine 
 It was a small , cramped space , and the only window was covered by a poster of a beach 
 The sun had long since set , and the only light came from the flickering fluorescent bulbs 
 ProtagonistA's eyes were bloodshot , and ProtagonistA's head ached from the constant staring 
 The war was being fought between two rival gangs in the city 
 They were fighting for control of the drug trade , and the violence had been escalating 
 They were too caught up in the fighting to see the futility of it all 
 That would be peaceful 
 Suddenly , there was a loud crash outside 
 The driver was slumped over the steering wheel , and the car was engulfed in flames 
 ProtagonistA had been caught stealing from the local grocery store and now ProtagonistA was in big trouble 
 The police had been called and they were on their way 
 Suddenly , an idea came to ProtagonistA 
 Maybe the police would take ProtagonistA to a mental hospital instead of jail 
 It was worth a try 
 The more ProtagonistA acted like ProtagonistA was losing it , the more convinced the police became 
 They decided to take ProtagonistA to the hospital for evaluation 
 ProtagonistA was relieved 
 It was n't exactly the outcome ProtagonistA had hoped for 
 But there was ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was Twilight 
 ProtagonistB was sitting on ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's most prized possession , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly 
 It was coming from a nearby field , and ProtagonistA could n't resist dancing to it 
 It was a small , family - run business and ProtagonistA was the only employee 
 The horses were ProtagonistA's passion and ProtagonistA loved working with them 
 It was a beautiful night , and ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit lonely 
 ProtagonistA was exhausted from a long day of work and was looking forward to a relaxing evening 
It was that rainy morning in July , that ProtagonistA was watching over ProtagonistA's new house 
 However , the rain was making ProtagonistA a little anxious 
 The rain was just adding to the beauty 
 It was a simple card , with a few lines and squiggles , but to ProtagonistA it was the most beautiful thing in the world 
 It was perfect 
 Absolutely perfect 
 The moon stopped shining while ProtagonistA was lying in bed , staring at the ceiling 
 It was gone 
 The sun was rising , and the world was getting lighter , but the moon was still gone 
 ProtagonistA had been stabbed multiple times in the chest and was bleeding out quickly 
ProtagonistB's eyes went wide in alarm as ProtagonistA spun , ProtagonistA's hooves shaking in the blackness 
 ProtagonistB had never seen ProtagonistA move so fast , and ProtagonistB was worried that ProtagonistA would hurt ProtagonistA 
 One day , while watching ProtagonistA's blank expression as it was reflected in a mirror , ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA quite like it quite a bit 
 It was a shame that ProtagonistA was stuck in this stuffy old apartment , when ProtagonistA could be out there enjoying the fresh air and the company of those magnificent creatures 
 The drink was a new type of energy drink that had just hit the market 
 It was called  Meltdown  and it lived up to its name 
 The drink was so powerful that it made ProtagonistA's body feel like it was on fire 
ProtagonistB had always been there for ProtagonistA , understanding ProtagonistA better than anyone else 
 ProtagonistB always knew what to say to ProtagonistA and when to say it 
 ProtagonistB was always there to listen to ProtagonistA and to help ProtagonistA through whatever ProtagonistA was going through 
 ProtagonistB was the only person who truly understood ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was grateful for that 
 Without ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would not be the person ProtagonistA is today 
 The dragon had been there for days , ever since ProtagonistB had made a wish on a shooting star 
 ProtagonistB had wished for a dragon of ProtagonistB's own and , apparently , ProtagonistB's wish had come true 
 But now , ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes and ProtagonistB was getting impatient 
 ProtagonistB want ProtagonistB's cupcake now !  ProtagonistB demanded , stamping ProtagonistB's foot 
 ProtagonistA brought it to ProtagonistB and , sure enough , ProtagonistB immediately stopped pacing and began to eat it 
 Thank ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said , with ProtagonistB's mouth full of cupcake 
 ProtagonistB was always smiling and seemed to enjoy ProtagonistB's job 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB loved it and that it was a great place to work 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB loved the people ProtagonistB worked with and that they were like family to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistB's words and decided to ask ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB would like to work at the dress shop with ProtagonistA 
 After all , it had been a long time since they had seen each other 
 ProtagonistB was carrying a big backpack and ProtagonistB looked a little tired , but ProtagonistB was still smiling 
 When ProtagonistB reached the top , ProtagonistB hugged ProtagonistA tightly 
 I'm so glad to see ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 Then they sat down and talked about all the things that had happened since they last saw each other 
 It was great to be reunited with ProtagonistB again 
Rainbow Dash , through the thickets of underbrush , through the smog , through the deep dark , lay in the dimness of ProtagonistA's chambers , ProtagonistA's head on ProtagonistA's hooves 
 ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistB and save ProtagonistB from the evil Bob 
 The pony was white with a black mane and tail , and it was looking at ProtagonistA with its big , brown eyes 
 Then the pony spoke to ProtagonistA 
  Hello , ProtagonistA ,  the pony said 
  I 'm here to take ProtagonistA on a magical journey 
 They went on a wild adventure , and when it was over , ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never forget the pony or the magical journey they had taken together 
 Suddenly , the squirrel noticed ProtagonistA and scurried away 
 They locked eyes for a moment before the squirrel went back to eating its acorn 
 It was a beautiful day , and the sun was just starting to set 
 ProtagonistA had been told about it by an old man ProtagonistA had met on ProtagonistA's travels 
 The man had told ProtagonistA that if ProtagonistA could find the treasure , it would change ProtagonistA's life forever 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA's eyes caught on something shining in the sun 
 It was a gold coin ! ProtagonistA's heart started racing 
 And sure enough , there were more 
 It was a chest filled with gold and jewels 
 ProtagonistA had found it ! The old man had been right 
 This treasure was going to change ProtagonistA's life forever 
 Maybe a change of scenery would do ProtagonistA some good 
 ProtagonistB was an old friend of ProtagonistA's father , and ProtagonistB had been asking ProtagonistA for help with a story ProtagonistB was working on 
 ProtagonistB explained that ProtagonistB was working on a story about a local politician who was taking bribes 
 ProtagonistB had been following the politician for weeks , and ProtagonistB had finally gotten enough evidence to prove ProtagonistB's case 
 The two of them drove to the newspaper office and dropped off the evidence 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help , and ProtagonistA went home 
 Suddenly , the phone rang and it was ProtagonistB on the other end ! They chatted for hours , catching up on all that had happened since they last spoke 
 It was like no time had passed at all 
 But what most ponies did n't know was that ProtagonistA had a heart of gold 
 The sound of the moon was quiet and the only thing bothering ProtagonistA was that the air was slightly too cold for ProtagonistA's liking 
 That all changed when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was a strong and independent woman who did n't take any crap from anyone 
 ProtagonistB taught ProtagonistA how to stand up for ProtagonistA and how to use a gun 
 It was like a big blanket of light that covered ProtagonistA 
 But that 's not necessarily a bad thing 
 By the time ProtagonistA got to the door , there was no one there , but ProtagonistA could 've sworn ProtagonistA heard footsteps running away 
 ProtagonistA's heart started to race as ProtagonistA realized that someone had been in ProtagonistA's house while ProtagonistA was cooking 
 There , standing in ProtagonistA's kitchen , was ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB back to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was rummaging through ProtagonistA's cupboards , and ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistB must be looking for something 
 For a moment , they just stared at each other , neither of them knowing what to say 
 And then , in a flash , ProtagonistB was gone , running out the door and disappearing into the night 
 ProtagonistA was shaken , but ProtagonistA was also relieved 
 Whoever ProtagonistB was , ProtagonistB had n't taken anything 
 Whoever ProtagonistB was , ProtagonistB was long gone 
 It was finally time for ProtagonistA's big heist 
 Everything was in place 
 It was over 
 ProtagonistA was caught 
 All because of a few diamonds 
 It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was enjoying the peace and quiet of ProtagonistA's home 
 ProtagonistA was shocked at first , but then ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA could use this to ProtagonistA's advantage 
 But then , suddenly , ProtagonistA's horse stumbled and ProtagonistA was thrown from the saddle 
 The pills had only made ProtagonistA sick 
 ProtagonistA was disappointed 
Twilight is there 
 But ProtagonistA ca n't help it- something about ProtagonistB just makes ProtagonistA want to laugh 
 ProtagonistB 's probably wondering why ProtagonistA 's laughing , but ProtagonistA does n't care 
 Then , ProtagonistA's boss chewed ProtagonistA out for being late 
 ProtagonistA's stomach hurt , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to throw up 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB came over and saw that ProtagonistA was sick 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC said that ProtagonistA had a stomach virus and needed to stay hydrated 
 ProtagonistC gave ProtagonistA some medicine and told ProtagonistB to give ProtagonistA lots of fluids 
 ProtagonistB did , and ProtagonistA started to feel better 
 Hello there !  ProtagonistB said in a friendly voice 
  ProtagonistB's name is Twilight Sparkle 
 ProtagonistB was just out for a walk and ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistA's stomach growling 
 Are ProtagonistA hungry?Bob 's stomach answered for ProtagonistA with a loud rumble 
 ProtagonistB smiled and produced a bag of apples from thin air 
 Here ProtagonistA go !  ProtagonistB said , handing the bag to ProtagonistA 
  Enjoy!With that , ProtagonistB trotted away , leaving ProtagonistA to enjoy ProtagonistA's feast 
 It was the same story , over and over again 
 How ProtagonistB had met ProtagonistA's father , how they had fallen in love , how they had gotten married 
 But ProtagonistB loved telling the story 
 It was ProtagonistB's favorite thing to do 
 And so , every time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB would ask ProtagonistA to listen to ProtagonistB's story again 
 ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA 'm sorry , but ProtagonistA do n't want to hear ProtagonistB's story again 
 Can we do something else today?Bob 's mother was taken aback 
 ProtagonistB did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistB had never been told that before 
 I'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB just love telling that story 
 It 's ProtagonistB's favorite thing to do 
 ProtagonistB 'll understand if ProtagonistA do n't want to listen to it again , but can we at least do something else together ProtagonistA thought for a moment 
 Okay , ProtagonistB 
 Let 's do something else today 
 They went for a walk , played some games , and just enjoyed each other 's company 
 It was a nice change for both of them 
 ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's job , ProtagonistA's wife had left ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was struggling to make ends meet 
 ProtagonistA was found dead the next day 
It was a warm afternoon in April , the watch of the royal court being to witness the first trial of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been caught and tried for ProtagonistB's crimes , but ProtagonistA had managed to escape 
 However , the king 's men had finally caught up with ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was now standing trial for ProtagonistA's crimes 
 The court was packed , everyone eager to see how the trial would play out 
 ProtagonistA was brought into the room , ProtagonistA's hands and feet shackled 
 ProtagonistA stood before the court , ProtagonistA's head held high 
 ProtagonistC began to list ProtagonistA's crimes , but ProtagonistA interrupted ProtagonistC 
  ProtagonistB was the one who committed the crimes , not me!The prosecutor sneered at ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB is already dead ,  ProtagonistC said 
  And even if ProtagonistB was still alive , there is no way to prove that ProtagonistA are not in league with ProtagonistB 
 The crowd was getting restless , and the king signaled for ProtagonistA to be taken away 
 ProtagonistA went quietly , ProtagonistA's head held high 
 It was early morning , and the sun was just starting to peek over the horizon 
 ProtagonistA's home was in disarray 
 It looked like a tornado had hit it 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the sapland was a place of peace and healing , and that people came there to find themselves 
 The sapland became a part of ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA was grateful to have found it 
It was dinner time for a couple of hours when the doorbell rang , and ProtagonistA came to the door to discover that ProtagonistB had just drowned 
 ProtagonistA 's cast ProtagonistA's net out wide , and ProtagonistA 's sure ProtagonistA 's going to catch something big 
 ProtagonistA 's been waiting for a big catch like this for a long time 
 The moon is high in the sky , and the stars are shining bright 
 But ProtagonistA is determined 
 It 's the biggest fish ProtagonistA 's ever seen 
 ProtagonistA 's done it 
 ProtagonistA 's finally caught the big one 
 ProtagonistB looked ProtagonistA up and down 
  ProtagonistA do n't look like a adventurer ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB looked impressed 
  Very well ,  ProtagonistB said 
The last full moon of the sultry afternoons of January and February was the last time that the air was clear and ProtagonistA shone pale and clear across the land 
  ProtagonistA , it 's ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA were dead , too ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But ProtagonistB 'm not 
 ProtagonistB 'm here , and ProtagonistB 'm going to help ProtagonistA 
 The day was perfect , and ProtagonistA was soon lost in the peacefulness of nature , enjoying the simple pleasure of being outdoors and surrounded by beauty 
 It was enough just to be there , in that perfect moment , free from all the worries of the world 
 ProtagonistB had been there with ProtagonistB's own friends , and they had all been playing together 
 They had become friends after that , and they had stayed in touch even after they had both moved away 
ProtagonistA was called Astrid , and ProtagonistA was a little girl 
 They were all very happy there , and they lived together happily ever after 
 ProtagonistC had been killed in a hunting accident 
 ProtagonistC had been out with ProtagonistC's friends , trying to get a deer for the family 
 But ProtagonistC had slipped and fallen , and the deer had gored ProtagonistC with its antlers 
 ProtagonistB came home and saw ProtagonistA standing there 
 ProtagonistB knew what had happened and ProtagonistB collapsed to the ground , weeping 
 Oh yeah , oh yeah , just twenty - one minutes long 
 Well 
 That means just eighteen minutes 
 But that does n't matter , because on top of that ProtagonistA was already coming up with a whole bunch of ways to torture me 
 I was going to have to listen to ProtagonistA talk for hours , and there was nothing I could do about it 
 I tried to focus on something else , anything else , but it was impossible 
 All I could hear was ProtagonistA's voice , droning on and on 
 I wanted to scream , to run away , to anything to make it stop 
 But I could n't 
 I was trapped , forced to listen to every word ProtagonistA said 
 It was torture , pure and simple 
 And I knew that it would only get worse as the hours went on 
 It was the house ProtagonistA had grown up in and the house ProtagonistA would always remember 
 ProtagonistA's parents had worked hard to make it a home for their family and ProtagonistA was grateful for all they had done 
 Peter 's 
 ProtagonistA was admitted into the good order of the church only by consent of the vicar , but who at Bob 's death had been faithful to it ever since 
 ProtagonistB had been gone for hours , and ProtagonistA was starting to get worried 
 Suddenly , the door opened and ProtagonistB walked in 
  ProtagonistB could never forget about ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB was just out for a walk 
 The stars are beautiful tonight , are n't they?Rainbow Dash followed ProtagonistB's gaze up to the sky 
 ProtagonistA had to admit , the stars were pretty 
 Of course not ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'll always come back for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 
 The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was playing with ProtagonistA's friends in the park 
 ProtagonistB looked down at ProtagonistA 
 Welcome to ProtagonistA's new home , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistA was taken to a small room and chained to the wall 
 ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA there , laughing as ProtagonistB went 
 ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistA had a right to treat with great violence , or to abandon the laws , that were established under their former alliance , upon the rights of which ProtagonistA was , as ProtagonistA claims , the first and foremost citizen 
 It was a tragic sight , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a sense of relief 
 ProtagonistB had been a abusive woman , and ProtagonistA had always dreaded going home to ProtagonistB 
It was the day ProtagonistB , died , yet ProtagonistA was feeling very much alive 
 That gave ProtagonistA some comfort and ProtagonistA was finally able to start processing what had happened 
 It was going to be a long road ahead , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could get through it with the help of ProtagonistA's loved ones 
 Tonight , they seemed especially bright and ProtagonistA felt at peace 
 And as brave and beautiful as a bull in a stallion , ProtagonistA fought for ProtagonistA's life against the vicious creatures that had captured ProtagonistA 
 But the price was high : ProtagonistA's wings were torn from ProtagonistA's back , and ProtagonistA was left with a permanent reminder of ProtagonistA's ordeal in the form of a long , jagged scar 
 It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was enjoying the peace and quiet 
 The people march up to the house and start banging on the door 
 Suddenly , the door bursts open and the people come rushing in 
 The people start chanting and ProtagonistA is terrified 
 Suddenly , they start throwing stones at ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA is hit 
ProtagonistA's skirt was almost completely around ProtagonistA's ankles , but ProtagonistA 'd told me that ProtagonistA would n't have mercy on me 
 I was begging for ProtagonistA to let me go , but ProtagonistA just laughed and pulled me closer 
 I could feel the cold metal of the knife against my skin and I knew that my time was running out 
 Suddenly , I heard a loud crash and ProtagonistA fell to the ground 
 I looked up to see my savior , the police officer who had come just in time 
 I was safe now , but I would never forget the terror I felt in those moments when I thought I was going to die 
ProtagonistA burst through the door to ProtagonistB's room , screaming ,  What 's happened ?  ProtagonistB was sitting on ProtagonistB's bed , looking pale and shaken 
  ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB was in the bathroom , and ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistC in the mirror 
  Come on , ProtagonistB , there 's no such thing as ghosts 
   ProtagonistB know that ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was a woman , and ProtagonistC was wearing a white dress 
 ProtagonistC had long hair , and ProtagonistC was floating in the air 
  ProtagonistB 're just seeing things , ProtagonistB 
 There 's nothing there 
  But ProtagonistB was adamant 
  ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB 'm telling ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistC was right there in the mirror 
 Maybe they could help ProtagonistB deal with whatever was going on 
 When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA was met with open arms by ProtagonistA's subjects 
 They were happy to have ProtagonistA back 
 Thanks to ProtagonistA's hard work , ProtagonistA's kingdom flourished 
 ProtagonistA's subjects were happy and life was good 
 ProtagonistA was done with this life , this world , and ProtagonistA was ready to move on 
 The creature was standing on its hind legs and had its front paws outstretched 
 The creature slowly approached ProtagonistA and sniffed ProtagonistA's outstretched hand 
 The bear continued to sniff ProtagonistA's hand and then licked it 
 After a few minutes , the bear wandered off into the woods 
 ProtagonistA's feet were sore and ProtagonistA's throat was dry , but ProtagonistA kept going 
 There was n't a single person in sight 
 ProtagonistA's hair was ProtagonistA's pride and joy 
 ProtagonistA was horrified at the sight of ProtagonistA's hair 
 It was a complete disaster 
 It cost ProtagonistA a fortune , but it was worth it 
 It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 They were ProtagonistA's friends , and ProtagonistA loved them 
 They had been replaced by machines , and ProtagonistA could n't stand it 
 They were a part of ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA would never forget them 
 However , ProtagonistA's wild optimism often led ProtagonistA to behave in a hostile manner 
 This often led to arguments and confrontations 
 ProtagonistA's wild optimism was both a blessing and a curse 
 On one hand , it helped ProtagonistA to see the best in people and to find the silver lining in every cloud 
 On the other hand , it often led ProtagonistA to behave in a way that was harmful to ProtagonistA and to others 
ProtagonistB sat on the bank , and stretched out ProtagonistA's hooves before ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB 'm going to have to give ProtagonistA a trim soon ,  ProtagonistB said , running ProtagonistB's fingers through the long , tangled hair 
  But first , let 's get ProtagonistA cleaned up 
 ProtagonistB was gentle but firm , scrubbing away at the grime until ProtagonistA's hooves were clean and shining 
 There ProtagonistA go ,  ProtagonistB said , putting the bucket down 
  All clean 
 ProtagonistA nickered softly , thank ProtagonistB for taking care of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB smiled and patted ProtagonistA's neck 
  No problem , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB 'm always here to help 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
 The Twilight Sparkle said ,  I 'm sorry to intrude , but I saw ProtagonistA's half - eaten apple and thought ProtagonistA might want it back 
 The Twilight Sparkle said ,  Well , I 'll just leave it here then ,  and placed the apple on the table 
 ProtagonistA snapped out of ProtagonistA's trance and said ,  Wait ! Do n't go !  The Twilight Sparkle stopped and turned back to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 'm so lonely 
  The Twilight Sparkle hesitated , but then agreed 
The first time I saw ProtagonistA drape the tray table of ProtagonistA's crib across the kitchen window , it was ProtagonistB , looking through the window and murmuring ,  Oh , there 's a boy 
  I was so startled that I almost dropped my tray of food 
 It was clear that ProtagonistB had never seen a baby before , let alone one in a crib 
 I quickly set the tray down and went to the window to see what ProtagonistB was looking at 
 I could n't help but smile at the sight 
 ProtagonistB was still murmuring to ProtagonistB ,  Oh , there 's a boy ,  as I walked away 
 It was clear that ProtagonistB was enamored with ProtagonistA , and I knew that ProtagonistB would be a good friend to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was everything ProtagonistA had ever wanted in a man ; ProtagonistB was handsome , funny , and smart 
 But it quickly became apparent that ProtagonistB was only interested in ProtagonistA as a friend 
 ProtagonistB would never make a move , no matter how much ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistB to 
ProtagonistA's heart hammered as ProtagonistA's big blue eyes darting around the room 
 ProtagonistA's face was determined as ProtagonistA looked for a way to escape 
 ProtagonistA had been captured by the enemy and was being held in a small room with no windows and one door 
 The door opened and a guard came in 
 The horde was still there , slowly but surely gaining on ProtagonistA 
 They were all different shades of grey , with the occasional pink or white one mixed in 
 Suddenly , the ground started shaking and the sky turned pink and white 
 ProtagonistA was being pulled into the dream world 
Me too , ProtagonistB , gushed ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's eyes sparkling as ProtagonistA turned the thick chain of grass around ProtagonistA to the side 
 ProtagonistA never thought ProtagonistA 'd find another one like ProtagonistB , but here ProtagonistB is ! Can you believe it ? 
 ProtagonistA worked hard all ProtagonistA's life , first as a farmhand and then as a blacksmith 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to the village 
 ProtagonistB was beautiful and kind , and ProtagonistB spoke to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB wanted ProtagonistA to be ProtagonistB's king 
 ProtagonistA was crowned king , and ProtagonistA ruled for many years 
 It was a radical idea , but ProtagonistA knew that it was the right thing to do 
 The Pony Ghost had told ProtagonistA to find the lost city of gold and save the princess 
On the night of the murder , ProtagonistA was killed as ProtagonistA walked to the parlor of the Reynolds ' house to fetch a glass of water 
 ProtagonistA was stabbed repeatedly with a kitchen knife and ProtagonistA's body was left in a pool of blood 
 The murder weapon was never found 
 It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was enjoying the sunshine 
 The trees were so tall that they blocked out the sky 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 In the clearing was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was sitting on the ground , crying 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB was lost 
 ProtagonistB had been walking in the forest for days and could n't find ProtagonistB's way out 
 Together , they started walking 
 After a while , they came to the edge of the forest 
 ProtagonistB was so happy to be out of the Forest 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help and went on ProtagonistB's way 
ProtagonistB always told ProtagonistA that the sky was the limit 
 It was like nothing ProtagonistA had ever seen before 
 It was a sight to behold 
 ProtagonistA's eyes flew open and ProtagonistA jumped to ProtagonistA's feet , ready to take off at a moment 's notice 
 It was just a little bird , looking for a place to rest 
 After a few minutes , the bird found a spot next to ProtagonistA and settled down 
Some time before the disaster that afflicted the city of Traver , under the watchful eye of the wizard of ProtagonistD , ProtagonistA , stood before the Great CENTIME , and told the tale of ProtagonistB , by the spirited chaperone of ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB had been kicked out of ProtagonistB's home by ProtagonistB's stepfather , and ProtagonistB had nowhere to go 
 ProtagonistB was cold and hungry , and ProtagonistB had given up hope of ever finding a place to stay 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistB saw a light in a window , and ProtagonistB heard a voice calling to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB went to the window and saw ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistC assured ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB would be safe 
 ProtagonistB went inside , and ProtagonistC introduced ProtagonistC as Lady Elizabeth 
 ProtagonistC told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistC was a wizard , and that ProtagonistC could help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC gave ProtagonistB a warm meal and a place to sleep , and ProtagonistC promised to help ProtagonistB find a new home 
 The next day , ProtagonistC took ProtagonistB to the wizard of ProtagonistD , who agreed to take ProtagonistB in and train ProtagonistB as a wizard 
 ProtagonistB was overjoyed , and ProtagonistB has been living with the wizard ever since 
 Lady Elizabeth was a kind and generous woman , who helped ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB was in need 
 ProtagonistA yawns and stretches and climbs out of bed 
Rose looked out over the plain , but on the sound of a distant voice ProtagonistA knew exactly where ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistB was standing on a small hill , and ProtagonistB was looking right at ProtagonistA 
 It was early morning , and the sun had not yet risen above the horizon , when ProtagonistA came across the hare 
 The hare was crouched down in the long grass , and it was clear that it was in a state of great agitation 
 ProtagonistA's parents had always encouraged ProtagonistA to pursue ProtagonistA's dreams , and ProtagonistA was determined to make them proud 
 ProtagonistA was driven , ambitious , and talented , and ProtagonistA was not going to let anything stand in ProtagonistA's way 
 When ProtagonistA's friends found ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was covered in mud and muck from the swamp below 
 They were all very amused by ProtagonistA's predicament and laughed at ProtagonistA 
 Today , ProtagonistA was glued to ProtagonistA's TV set , watching as the final round was played out 
 The stakes were high , and the contestants were giving it their all 
 It was all very exciting 
 Finally , the moment of truth arrived 
 The final question was asked , and the contestants gave their final answers 
 When the dust settled , there was a new champion 
 ProtagonistA's feet were blistered and sore , ProtagonistA's throat was dry and scratchy , and ProtagonistA's head was pounding 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 In the clearing was ProtagonistB , crying ProtagonistB's eyes out 
 Hello there 
 What 's wrong?The girl looked up at ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's big , blue eyes 
  ProtagonistB 'm lost ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 've been walking for hours , and ProtagonistB ca n't find ProtagonistB's way home 
 ProtagonistA's heart went out to ProtagonistB 
 But first , let 's rest for a bit , okay?The girl nodded , and ProtagonistA sat down next to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistB , had ProtagonistA ; and , though ProtagonistA was only fifty - one , ProtagonistA was already growing very old indeed 
 ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA dearly , and ProtagonistB did everything ProtagonistB could to care for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB cooked ProtagonistA's favorite meals , read to ProtagonistA , and kept ProtagonistA company 
 It was hard to see ProtagonistA declining day by day , but ProtagonistB cherished the time they had together 
 ProtagonistB was heartbroken , but ProtagonistB took comfort in knowing that ProtagonistA was no longer in pain 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was finally at peace 
 Then , ProtagonistA's boss chewed ProtagonistA out for being late 
 To top it all off , ProtagonistA got stuck in traffic on the way home 
 The cat meowed and rubbed against the window , wanting to be let in 
 The cat hissed and ran off 
 It had been a long day , and ProtagonistA was ready for bed 
This is the story of ProtagonistA , except that ProtagonistA was what ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistB nickered in response and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart fill with warmth 
 ProtagonistB was so small that ProtagonistB could barely stand , and ProtagonistB had a very strange look on ProtagonistB's face 
 ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB Ponytail and soon they became the best of friends 
 ProtagonistB was always happy and playful , but ProtagonistA could tell that there was something different about ProtagonistB 
 The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was being in ProtagonistA's car , driving home from work 
 It was getting closer 
 Help would find ProtagonistA soon 
The thin smile of ProtagonistA swept across ProtagonistA's gorgeous features as ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB across the room 
 ProtagonistB was a beautiful woman , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be the perfect addition to ProtagonistA's collection 
 Before long , they were making their way back to ProtagonistA's place 
 ProtagonistB was just another conquest to add to ProtagonistA's collection 
 ProtagonistA loved the attention ProtagonistA was getting and ProtagonistA was loving every minute of it 
 ProtagonistA wanted to get up and continue on ProtagonistA's way but ProtagonistA's pride was bruised 
 ProtagonistA was surrounded by ProtagonistA's loyal subjects and ProtagonistA's beautiful queen 
 The sky was a deep blue , the sun was shining , and the clouds were fluffy and white 
 ProtagonistA had been so caught up in ProtagonistA's work that ProtagonistA had forgotten to appreciate the simple things in life 
 One day , ProtagonistB was in a car accident and was taken to the hospital 
 Finally , after what felt like forever , ProtagonistB walked out of the hospital with a big smile on ProtagonistB's face 
ProtagonistA was a detective working in the north of England and ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA 'd never seen anything like it 
 ProtagonistB was found in a ditch , half - naked and covered in blood 
 ProtagonistB was a young woman , no more than twenty years old 
 ProtagonistB's hair was matted with blood and ProtagonistB's eyes were wide open , staring into the cold , dark night 
 There was something about this case that ProtagonistA just could n't shake 
 The police investigation turned up very little 
 There were no witnesses and no one had seen anything 
 The only thing they had to go on was the fact that ProtagonistB's body had been found near a small town in the middle of nowhere 
 ProtagonistC was scared and did n't want to give ProtagonistC's name , but ProtagonistC said ProtagonistC 'd seen something the night ProtagonistB was killed 
 ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA where to find ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA went to meet ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC 'd seen ProtagonistD dragging ProtagonistB into the woods 
 ProtagonistC was too scared to do anything at the time , but ProtagonistC 'd remembered ProtagonistD's face 
 ProtagonistC described ProtagonistD to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew immediately who ProtagonistD was 
 It was a difficult case , but in the end , justice was served 
 ProtagonistB had been so beautiful , and ProtagonistA had been so taken aback by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB 'm not sure , ProtagonistB need to do some more research , ProtagonistB replied 
 ProtagonistB think we should wait and see how the market fluctuates over the next few weeks before making any decisions 
ProtagonistB had always been a bit of a mystery to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB never talked about ProtagonistB's past , and whenever ProtagonistA asked about ProtagonistB's family , ProtagonistB would always change the subject 
 So , when ProtagonistB announced one day that they were going to visit the Apple family , ProtagonistA was intrigued 
 The Apple family home was a large , imposing mansion 
 ProtagonistB was greeted warmly by the family , and it was clear that they knew each other well 
 ProtagonistA was introduced to the family , and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA caught up in their stories and laughter 
 It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever felt like ProtagonistA belonged somewhere 
ProtagonistB had been trying to talk ProtagonistA into taking a trip to ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB had always wanted to see the sights and sounds of ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistB thought it would be a great opportunity for ProtagonistA to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city 
 But ProtagonistB was insistent , and ProtagonistB finally convinced ProtagonistA to give it a try 
 The first thing ProtagonistA noticed was the smell of the fresh air 
 It was a far cry from the smog and pollution of the city 
 They were everywhere , and they were all so beautiful 
 ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA lying in the field 
 ProtagonistB could tell that ProtagonistA was in pain 
 ProtagonistB held ProtagonistA's hoof flat against the back of the head , and the rest of ProtagonistA's body relaxed into the hovering motion of the completed form 
 ProtagonistB knew what to do 
 ProtagonistB gently picked ProtagonistA up and carried ProtagonistA back to the barn 
 ProtagonistC came and looked at ProtagonistA's hoof 
 ProtagonistC said that ProtagonistA would need to rest for a while , but ProtagonistA would be okay 
 The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was going to bed the night before 
 On the other side was a beautiful garden 
 They were all smiling and happy 
ProtagonistA was in the sky and looked like a jewel when ProtagonistA rose , but I never did see ProtagonistA bigger than a ball , and it was n't until I was seventeen that I realized I was bigger than ProtagonistA 
 I was out on a date with ProtagonistB at the time , and we were lying on a blanket in the park , looking up at the stars 
 I pointed out ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB just laughed and said ,  You 're bigger than ProtagonistA , silly 
  I was so embarrassed , but I realized ProtagonistB was right 
 I was bigger than ProtagonistA 
 I had never thought about it before , but I was bigger than the moon and the stars 
 I was bigger than the universe 
 And it was a beautiful feeling 
 The water was up to ProtagonistA's waist , and the current was strong 
 ProtagonistA was pulled under the water and swept away 
ProtagonistA's name was Marilyn , but I do not know ProtagonistA or care for ProtagonistA 
 I never really liked ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's boyfriend so I had to be nice to ProtagonistA 
 I never understood what ProtagonistB saw in ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB was head over heels in love with ProtagonistA 
 I remember one time , ProtagonistB came to me crying because ProtagonistA had cheated on ProtagonistB 
 I comforted ProtagonistB and told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB deserved better 
 I was so happy when ProtagonistB finally dumped ProtagonistA 
 I never had to pretend to be friends with ProtagonistA again 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought , wondering if there was anyone else out there in the vast universe 
 Suddenly , a shooting star streaked across the sky , and ProtagonistA made a wish 
 ProtagonistB was staring at ProtagonistA with the same look of wonder and curiosity 
 ProtagonistA was exhausted from all the work ProtagonistA had to do to keep ProtagonistA's kingdom running smoothly 
 Soon , the entire room was engulfed in flames 
 ProtagonistA had been waiting for weeks , ever since ProtagonistB had been arrested for a crime ProtagonistB did n't commit 
 Finally , the day had arrived 
 The piece of paper arrived in the mail , and ProtagonistA rushed to ProtagonistB's cell to give it to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was overjoyed , and they embraced each other through the bars 
 Finally , ProtagonistB would be free 
ProtagonistB had stood by ProtagonistA's side as ProtagonistA worked at sundown on the last day of the year two thousand and eight 
 The house was almost done and it would be ready for the family to move in by the New Year 
 ProtagonistB was helping ProtagonistA and they were both sweating in the cold December air 
 They were almost done when they heard a noise 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 They both turned around and saw ProtagonistC standing at the edge of the property 
 ProtagonistC was crying and ProtagonistC looked lost 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistC if ProtagonistC was okay and ProtagonistC said that ProtagonistC was lost 
 ProtagonistC said that ProtagonistC was looking for ProtagonistD 
 ProtagonistD had run away from home a few weeks ago and ProtagonistC had been looking for ProtagonistD ever since 
 Dave and Bob both felt sorry for ProtagonistC and they decided to help ProtagonistC 
 They spent the next few hours searching for ProtagonistD 
 They finally found ProtagonistD at a nearby park 
 ProtagonistD was cold and hungry , but ProtagonistD was safe 
 Dave and Bob both felt good about helping ProtagonistC find ProtagonistD 
 It was a great way to end the year 
 Soon , the room was filled with people 
 ProtagonistA's dish was a hit ! Everyone loved it , and ProtagonistA was congratulated on a job well done 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled , and ProtagonistA knew that this dish would be remembered for years to come 
 It would be a long and difficult journey , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do it 
 ProtagonistA had been born into a life of servitude and had never known anything else 
 ProtagonistA was used to the hard work and the long hours , but lately , something had been different 
 As ProtagonistA stood in ProtagonistA's stall , ProtagonistA's eyes filled with tears as ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA's thoughts turned to revenge as ProtagonistA thought about the humans who had treated ProtagonistA so poorly 
 ProtagonistA was always too wrapped up in ProtagonistA's own life to really pay attention to ProtagonistB , and when ProtagonistB was younger , ProtagonistA would often forget to pick ProtagonistB up from school or take ProtagonistB to ProtagonistB's soccer games 
 As ProtagonistB got older , ProtagonistB stopped asking ProtagonistA to do things with ProtagonistB , and they gradually grew apart 
 They spent the day walking around the city , talking and catching up on all the things they had missed 
 It was a day ProtagonistA would never forget , and ProtagonistA vowed to be a better father from that day forward 
 ProtagonistA was rushed to the hospital , but it was too late 
 The doctors said there was nothing they could do 
Bob was herding the ponies to the barn when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's brother by the pool 
 ProtagonistA's partner was supportive , and they started making plans for the future 
 They were going to be parents , and they were going to be great at it 
 They had a lot of love to give , and they knew that they could provide a wonderful home for their child 
 Everyone was happy for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's partner , and they all welcomed the new addition to the family 
 It was a happy time for everyone , and they all looked forward to meeting the new baby 
There was once ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA had everything 
 ProtagonistA's quest took ProtagonistA to some of the most remote and dangerous places on earth 
 It was his way of dealing with his grief 
 Then ProtagonistA asked ,  What are you reading ?  ProtagonistA's father looked up and replied ,  I 'm reading about ProtagonistA's mother 
This is a story about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was born in a small town in the middle of nowhere 
 ProtagonistA's parents were poor and they could barely afford to feed ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA was five , ProtagonistA's father died in a car accident 
 ProtagonistB was left to raise ProtagonistA on ProtagonistB's own 
 ProtagonistB did the best ProtagonistB could , but ProtagonistB was struggling to make ends meet 
 ProtagonistC was a homeless man who had been living on the streets for years 
 ProtagonistC took ProtagonistA under ProtagonistC's wing and taught ProtagonistA everything ProtagonistC knew about surviving on the streets 
 ProtagonistC also taught ProtagonistA how to read and write 
 ProtagonistD gave ProtagonistA a place to stay and helped ProtagonistA get a job 
 However , ProtagonistA's past was always haunting ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was determined to succeed 
  Hey , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB missed ProtagonistA 
 The room was a maze and ProtagonistA was getting tired 
 There was a hole in the door and ProtagonistA could see the other side 
It was the summer day in 1833 that ProtagonistA , was walking ProtagonistB , down the road , and considering in ProtagonistA's mind whether ProtagonistA should continue to be a single mother , or if ProtagonistA should go back to the family home , and , indeed , if ProtagonistA should , to marry a woman 
 ProtagonistA had not been married for many years , and ProtagonistB was now grown and married ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistA's own wife , who had died when ProtagonistB was only a child 
  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB 've always wondered why ProtagonistA 'm so different from ProtagonistB 
 The truth is , ProtagonistA 'm not entirely human 
 ProtagonistA 'm actually a magical being from another world 
 ProtagonistA was sent here to help make ProtagonistB's life better , and ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA 've done a pretty good job 
 But now , ProtagonistA's magic is gone and ProtagonistA have to go back to ProtagonistA's own world 
 That recipe 's on ProtagonistC ,  said ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB , sitting down in a seat at the end of the court 
 What recipe ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 ProtagonistB was taken aback by the request 
  ProtagonistB 'm not sure ProtagonistB can do that ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistA 'm going to kill ProtagonistA's wife and ProtagonistA need to make sure ProtagonistA do n't get caught 
 The recipe is on ProtagonistC's computer and ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB to hack into it and get it for ProtagonistA 
 The lawyer was hesitant , but ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB could n't just let ProtagonistA commit murder 
 ProtagonistB agreed to try and get the recipe for the perfect crime 
 A few days later , ProtagonistB was able to hack into ProtagonistC's computer and get the recipe 
 ProtagonistB gave it to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was never caught and the recipe was never found 
 There were no people or animals , just a vast emptiness 
 This one was also locked 
 This one was not locked 
 There were flowers of all colors , and a soft breeze was blowing 
 ProtagonistA's feet were sore , ProtagonistA's throat was dry , and ProtagonistA's stomach was grumbling 
 It looked abandoned 
ProtagonistA's name was Elice and forever after , even now when I regret not having the courage to ask ProtagonistA's name , I will not forget ProtagonistA's dark face when ProtagonistA looked up at me with such wonder and such complete and utter confusion and such a strange and almost sadistic delight in the face of such great disappointment and such a strange and almost sadistic delight in the face of such great fear and such deep and profound fear 
 I had never seen anything like it before and I doubt I will ever see anything like it again 
 It was as if ProtagonistA had been expecting something great and wonderful and had been let down so badly that ProtagonistA could n't help but take some kind of sick pleasure in my own fear 
 It was important to ProtagonistA to stay focused , no matter what 
 But the more ProtagonistA tried to ignore the look , the more it seemed to bother ProtagonistA 
 It was as if the look was boring into ProtagonistA's soul , demanding ProtagonistA's attention 
 ProtagonistB , smiled 
  ProtagonistB 'm sorry , ProtagonistB did n't mean to stare 
 It 's just that ProtagonistA look so much like ProtagonistB's brother 
 ProtagonistA 'm sorry to hear about ProtagonistB's brother 
 Thank ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  It 's been hard , but ProtagonistB 'm trying to stay positive 
 With that , ProtagonistB turned and walked away , leaving ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's thoughts 
 ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistB's story and ProtagonistB's strength in the face of adversity 
 It reminded ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA , too , had to be strong 
 It was so cozy and perfect for ProtagonistA 
 However , what was surprising was that ProtagonistA was now standing in the middle of ProtagonistB's bookstore 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA was not used to the sight of so many books 
 In fact , it appeared as if ProtagonistA had never seen a bookstore before 
 ProtagonistB , approached ProtagonistA with a quizzical look on ProtagonistB's face 
  Can ProtagonistB help ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 ProtagonistA 've been told that ProtagonistA need to improve ProtagonistA's manners 
 ProtagonistB smiled and led ProtagonistA to the section on etiquette 
 ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA find a few books on the subject and then left ProtagonistA to browse 
 It was only when ProtagonistA was getting ready to leave that ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had completely forgotten about ProtagonistA's original mission 
 And , to ProtagonistA's surprise , the words came more easily than they had in weeks 
 The writing was helping ProtagonistA to process what had happened , and to make sense of it all 
 It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining down on the water , making it sparkle 
 The bear came closer and closer , until it was right in front of ProtagonistA 
 But the attack never came 
 When ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes , the bear was gone 
 The only light came from the castle , and the dog that ran in and out of the room was quite a bother 
 The king and queen were very kind and gave ProtagonistA a fire and some candles 
 They also gave ProtagonistA a blanket to keep warm 
 It was ProtagonistA's special place , where ProtagonistA could think and dream 
 Today , ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how it had turned out 
 ProtagonistA does n't remember me being born but ProtagonistA 's right ; I have the best hooves on the staff of Everfree 
 The best in magic 
 I was born in the early hours of the morning , just as the sun was peeking over the horizon 
  The best in magic 
 I believed ProtagonistA , and I still do 
 ProtagonistA 's never been wrong about anything 
 Like the time I accidentally turned ProtagonistA's favorite hat into a frog 
 Or when I turned ProtagonistA's favorite book into a pile of mush 
 Then , ProtagonistA's boss yelled at ProtagonistA for being late 
 But unfortunately , that moment never came 
 A dog came over and started barking at ProtagonistA , and a cat walked by and knocked ProtagonistA over 
 ProtagonistA quickly slit the muzzle of ProtagonistB's gun into the air and let out a little whine of  Oops !  around the top of ProtagonistA's throat 
 ProtagonistB was so startled by the sudden noise that ProtagonistB dropped ProtagonistB's gun and ran off in terror 
 They were all wearing strange clothes and they were speaking a language ProtagonistA had never heard before 
 We had been married for six months , and in that time , ProtagonistA had become increasingly distant 
 I had begged ProtagonistA to talk to me , to tell me what was wrong , but ProtagonistA always brushed me off 
 I was about to give up hope when ProtagonistA finally looked up from ProtagonistA's book and spoke to me 
 ProtagonistA's eyes were full of sadness and regret 
 ProtagonistA just 
 We both sat in silence for a moment , contemplating what our next move should be 
 It was clear that we both loved each other , but something was holding ProtagonistA back 
 I reached out and took ProtagonistA's hand , and ProtagonistA squeezed it tight 
 We'll figure this out ,  I said 
  Together 
ProtagonistA's hooves stopped pounding the dirt beside the bank , and ProtagonistA's eyes once more settled on the horizon 
 The cold water shocked ProtagonistA's system and ProtagonistA started to swim 
 It was a dark and stormy night , and ProtagonistA had been driving home from work 
 ProtagonistA's car had broken down , and ProtagonistA had been forced to seek shelter in a nearby house 
 The house had been abandoned , and ProtagonistA had been exploring it when ProtagonistA 'd suddenly fallen asleep 
 There was a door in front of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had opened it 
 ProtagonistA had been met by ProtagonistA 
 The two Bobs had then shaken hands and gone their separate ways 
 The sun was a huge orange ball that was slowly sinking into the horizon , and the sky was a beautiful red and orange 
 ProtagonistA loved sunsets , and ProtagonistA loved watching them from ProtagonistA's room 
 It was always so peaceful and calming 
 It had been a few weeks since the incident had occurred , and ProtagonistA still could n't shake the feeling that ProtagonistA was being watched 
 It was an unsettling feeling , to say the least 
 The incident itself was n't anything too out of the ordinary 
 It was only when ProtagonistA had heard shouting and commotion coming from the alleyway that ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA may have made a mistake 
 It was only then that ProtagonistA had realized that the other men were police officers , and that ProtagonistA had just saved the life of their undercover colleague 
 In the aftermath of the incident , ProtagonistA had been hailed as a hero 
 ProtagonistA's face had been splashed all over the newspapers and ProtagonistA had even been given a medal by the police 
 Now , it seemed , ProtagonistA's normal life was over 
 ProtagonistA was constantly being followed by the media , and ProtagonistA had even had to hire a bodyguard 
 It was all just too much for ProtagonistA 
 But it seemed that was no longer an option for ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistB had promised ProtagonistA that everything would be alright 
 It 's all right , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said so sweetly , that ProtagonistB's hooves shook the paper as ProtagonistB said it 
  ProtagonistB said so , and ProtagonistB 's never lied to ProtagonistA before , has he?The filly shook ProtagonistA's head , and ProtagonistB nuzzled ProtagonistA gently 
 Then trust ProtagonistB , everything will be just fine 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistB calling ProtagonistA's name until ProtagonistA was right in front of ProtagonistA 
  Yeah , ProtagonistA 'm fine 
 Just got a lot on ProtagonistA's mind 
  ProtagonistB nodded understandingly 
  Well , try to leave it at the door 
 We 've got a lot to do today 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistB calling ProtagonistA's name until ProtagonistB was right in front of ProtagonistB 
  Yeah , ProtagonistA 'm fine 
 Just got a lot on ProtagonistA's mind 
  ProtagonistB nodded understandingly 
  Well , try to leave it at the door 
 We 've got a lot to do today 
 Finally , the check arrived 
 ProtagonistA's heart sank as ProtagonistA saw the amount ; it was far less than ProtagonistA had been expecting 
 There was no way it would be enough to cover ProtagonistA's rent 
 ProtagonistB was looking for a fight , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was n't going to back down 
 They stared each other down for what felt like an eternity , until finally ProtagonistB made ProtagonistB's move 
 ProtagonistB charged straight for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was ready 
 ProtagonistB was momentarily stunned , and ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's opportunity 
 ProtagonistB went down , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had won 
 ProtagonistB answered , and when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB screamed 
 ProtagonistA 's been at it for hours , and ProtagonistA 's only halfway through 
 ProtagonistA's eyes are starting to glaze over , and ProtagonistA's head is starting to ache 
 ProtagonistA was really excited about life and ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistB to know it 
 The noise of the thunder and the lightning was so loud that ProtagonistA could barely hear ProtagonistA think 
 ProtagonistA's muscles were trembling and ProtagonistA's breath was coming in short , sharp gasps 
 The next thing ProtagonistA knew , ProtagonistA was being lifted into the air and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA being carried away from the storm 
 The bird must have seen ProtagonistA struggling and decided to help 
 Soon , they were far away from the storm and ProtagonistA could finally relax 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken and decided that it was time to move on 
ProtagonistA had always been a bridesmaid ; ProtagonistB had promised a wedding for ProtagonistA and had lived up to that 
 But when the day came , ProtagonistA was left at the altar by ProtagonistA's fiancée 
 It was a crushing blow to ProtagonistA's ego and ProtagonistA's heart 
 ProtagonistB was sympathetic , but ProtagonistB was also a realist 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that it was time to move on and find someone else 
 ProtagonistC was everything that ProtagonistA had ever wanted in a wife and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA wanted to spend the rest of ProtagonistA's life with ProtagonistC 
 They were married a year later and ProtagonistA was finally happy 
The fire had not yet subsided from the ruins of the old slum when ProtagonistA stood in the doorway of the house where I grew up 
 ProtagonistA's clothes were tattered and ProtagonistA's hair was wild , like ProtagonistA had been living on the streets for months 
 But the most shocking thing of all was the look in ProtagonistA's eyes 
 They were cold and empty , like ProtagonistA had given up on life 
 I asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was doing there , and ProtagonistA just shrugged 
 I told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA could stay with me , but ProtagonistA just shook ProtagonistA's head and said ProtagonistA did n't want to be a burden 
 I insisted , and finally ProtagonistA agreed 
 It 's been a year since ProtagonistA came to live with me , and ProtagonistA 's slowly starting to piece ProtagonistA's life back together 
 I 'm glad I was able to help ProtagonistA , but I know ProtagonistA would have never made it if ProtagonistA had n't come to my door that day 
 It was so bright and beautiful , like a crystal ball of light 
 ProtagonistB was old and wrinkled , but ProtagonistB had a kind face 
 ProtagonistB invited ProtagonistA in and fed ProtagonistA a warm meal 
 ProtagonistA was thrown into the back of a van and driven to an unknown location 
 ProtagonistA was thrown into a dark room and the door was locked 
 ProtagonistA was left there for days with no food or water 
 ProtagonistA's body was never found 
ProtagonistA's emails felt for the beast , but ProtagonistA 'd never seen it touch a living thing before 
 It was quick and efficient , and ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit of admiration for the creature 
 But one morning , ProtagonistA was caught red - handed by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 You know you 're not allowed to take books without permission 
 at least 
 said ProtagonistA , resting ProtagonistA's hoof on the end of ProtagonistB's hoof 
 They had been walking for hours , ever since they had seen the fire in the distance 
 Now , there was no sign of the fire , or any other living creature 
 The only sound was the crunching of their hooves on the dry , dead grass 
 I'm sure we 'll be fine ,  said ProtagonistB , although ProtagonistB did n't sound very sure 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistB stopped 
  What is it ?  asked ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB heard something ,  ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistB's ears perked up 
 Shh !  said ProtagonistB 
 It sounded like 
 laughter 
 Who 's there ?  called ProtagonistB 
 The laughter stopped , and there was silence 
 Come out , we wo n't hurt you !  called ProtagonistB 
 Still , there was no response 
 Maybe we should go ,  said ProtagonistA 
 But before they could move , they heard the laughter again , this time closer 
 And then , they saw them 
 Three creatures , with long , sharp teeth and bright red eyes 
 Run !  yelled ProtagonistB 
 And they did 
 They ran as fast as they could , the creatures hot on their heels 
 They made it to the safety of the forest and collapsed , exhausted , on the ground 
 That was close ,  said ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB's heart racing 
 Too close ,  said ProtagonistA 
  But at least we 're safe now 
 The shaking only got worse and worse until ProtagonistA collapsed to the ground 
ProtagonistA's imagination was an echo of ProtagonistA's senses and a recording of ProtagonistA's thoughts 
 This made ProtagonistA a very successful writer 
 ProtagonistA's imagination was like a movie projector , playing back scenes and events in ProtagonistA's mind 
 This made ProtagonistA an excellent detective , as ProtagonistA was able to piece together clues that others would miss 
 But there was much ProtagonistA did n't know 
 ProtagonistA's mer - dog was in a fiddle - and - trumpet , and ProtagonistA's little mare was in a carton 
 The sun was setting and the sky was a beautiful orange 
 The waves were crashing against the shore and the smell of salt was in the air 
 Everything was going to be alright 
 ProtagonistA was relieved and happy to be back home with ProtagonistA's wife 
 The screech came again , and this time it was followed by the sound of something heavy hitting the ground 
 The bird was looking right at ProtagonistA , and it did n't look happy 
 It was a beautiful day and ProtagonistA was surrounded by the beauty of nature 
 It was going to be a good day 
 When ProtagonistA sat down on ProtagonistA's hind legs and bridled the fierce thirst of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB calmed down and listened to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB listened intently and when ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to follow ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA to a herd of wild mustangs and introduced ProtagonistA to the alpha male 
 ProtagonistA was welcomed into the herd and ProtagonistA finally had a place to call home 
ProtagonistA had been living in the fort for a few months now and had grown to love the peace and quiet it provided 
 The other residents of the fort were friendly , but ProtagonistA never felt like ProtagonistA really fit in 
 ProtagonistA had been given the house by the fort 's owner and had furnished it with everything ProtagonistA needed 
 ProtagonistB collapsed to the ground and ProtagonistA ran back to the dining room , where ProtagonistA called the fort 's security 
 ProtagonistB was taken away and ProtagonistA was left alone in ProtagonistA's house 
There was once , in the sparsely - settled setting of the stone town of Golden ProtagonistA sat , ProtagonistA's eyes closed and listening to the sounds of the surrounding woods 
 Today , however , something was different 
 It was a strange feeling , and one that ProtagonistA could n't quite explain 
 But it was also a feeling that ProtagonistA could n't ignore 
 As ProtagonistA walked , the feeling grew stronger and stronger , until ProtagonistA came to a clearing in the woods 
 ProtagonistB was standing with ProtagonistB back to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB did n't seem to be aware of ProtagonistA's presence 
 They were a deep blue , and they seemed to look right into ProtagonistA's soul 
 ProtagonistB did n't say anything , but ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was busy at the stove , cooking dinner 
 Twilight Sparkle peered over ProtagonistA's shoulder at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was a kind woman , always busy taking care of ProtagonistB's family 
 Twilight Sparkle could n't help but admire ProtagonistB 
 They had always supported ProtagonistA's dream , and ProtagonistA knew they would be so proud of ProtagonistA 
 I was there with my mom , who was there for a check - up 
 I was six years old at the time 
 I was a lot taller than ProtagonistA and skinny as a rail 
 I had straight blond hair that was always getting in my eyes 
 I was wearing a pink dress with white lace trim 
 I remember that ProtagonistA and I started talking and we hit it off right away 
 We talked about our favorite animals and what we wanted to be when we grew up 
 We were both really interested in dinosaurs 
 ProtagonistA and I became friends after that day and we would see each other at the doctor 's office from time to time 
 We would always stop and chat for a bit 
 A few years later , when I was eight and ProtagonistA was six , we ran into each other at the park 
 We were both there with our families 
 We caught up on what had been going on in our lives and then we went our separate ways 
 I never saw ProtagonistA again after that day , but I always wondered what happened to ProtagonistA 
 Are n't ProtagonistA going to go home ?  said Sweetie-6 , scratching his head 
  I thought ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was going to go home 
   Maybe ProtagonistA changed ProtagonistA's mind ,  said Blue-5 
  I do n't know , but I hope ProtagonistA goes home soon 
 I 'm getting tired of ProtagonistA being here 
   Me too ,  said Sweetie-6 
  I 'm going to bed 
 Goodnight 
 ProtagonistB , however , was fresh and full of energy 
 ProtagonistB nickered softly as ProtagonistA brushed ProtagonistB's coat , and ProtagonistA could n't help but smile 
 There was something about being out in the open air that just made ProtagonistA feel alive 
 And ProtagonistB was one of ProtagonistA's favorite parts of the farm 
  ProtagonistB 're all set for the day 
 The mare nickered again and ProtagonistA turned to head back to the house 
 ProtagonistB remembered all of the good times they had together and how ProtagonistA had always been there for ProtagonistB 
 Even though ProtagonistA was gone , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA would always be with ProtagonistA in spirit 
 ProtagonistB had always admired that about ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistB was younger , ProtagonistB would often find ProtagonistA sitting in the same spot , waiting for the perfect fish to swim by 
 ProtagonistA never got frustrated , or angry 
 ProtagonistB had been sitting on the dock for hours , waiting for a bite 
 ProtagonistB was determined to catch a fish today 
 ProtagonistB had been out there since early morning , and it was now evening 
 The sun was beginning to set , and the moon was leveling off 
 ProtagonistB was getting tired , and was about to give up for the night , when ProtagonistB felt a tug on ProtagonistB's line 
 ProtagonistB reeled in the line , and sure enough , ProtagonistB had caught a fish 
 ProtagonistB was so excited , ProtagonistB forgot all about ProtagonistB's tiredness 
 ProtagonistB shouted for ProtagonistA to come over 
 ProtagonistB had finally caught a fish 
First known , at the end of the last century , to be the daughter of ProtagonistA , one of the statistics of Champlain , in that country , was that , after ProtagonistA's father had been dead for ten years , ProtagonistA had the advantage of four years ' education , and knew enough of the world , to be a good office seeker , and to be a good lever - broker , and a good carpenter , and , best of all , a good hatter 
 ProtagonistA had been cooped up in this house for far too long , and ProtagonistA was ready to explore 
 Maybe they knew something that ProtagonistA did n't 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated by the way they interacted with each other and the things they did 
 It was time to go 
 ProtagonistB , had been planning this trip for months , and now it was finally time to go 
 After all , they were going to be riding across the country on horseback 
 ProtagonistA had been trained for this trip , and ProtagonistA was ready to go 
 ProtagonistB saddled ProtagonistA up and they set off 
 The first few days were easy enough , but as they got further into their journey , the terrain became more difficult 
 They rode for hours each day , and ProtagonistA never once complained 
 And finally , after weeks of riding , they arrived at their destination 
 ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA had made it across the country on horseback , and they were both exhausted 
 But they had accomplished something amazing , and they would never forget the adventure they had shared 
 It was a big risk , but it paid off 
 ProtagonistA's first screenplay was a huge success 
 It sounded like a thunderstorm was coming 
 But the storm was getting closer and closer , and soon ProtagonistA was surrounded by dark clouds 
 Lightning flashed and thunder roared 
 The storm was too strong 
 Soon , ProtagonistA was blown into a cave by the wind 
 But it was hard to sleep with the thunder crashing and the lightning flashing 
ProtagonistA rode silently toward ProtagonistA's cabin , ProtagonistA's eyes half - closed and ProtagonistA's mind racing in its mind 's eye 
 It had been a long day and ProtagonistA was tired 
 It was ProtagonistA's conscience 
 It told ProtagonistA to be careful and not to do anything rash 
 They were carrying something in their hand 
 It told ProtagonistA to take the money and use it to help others 
 ProtagonistA's friends had been there for ProtagonistA though , and ProtagonistA knew they would be there to help ProtagonistA through this tough time 
I know this is a story about ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB , but even it ca n't be denied that it 's a story for the ages 
 It was a time when the world was a different place , and ProtagonistB was a different man 
 ProtagonistB was a man of ProtagonistB's word , and ProtagonistB did n't take kindly to people who did n't live up to their promises 
 That 's why , when ProtagonistB found out that ProtagonistD had left ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB was furious 
 ProtagonistB went to ProtagonistD's house and demanded that ProtagonistD marry ProtagonistC or ProtagonistB would kill ProtagonistD 
 ProtagonistD did n't take ProtagonistB seriously and laughed in ProtagonistB's face 
 That 's when ProtagonistB pulled out ProtagonistB's gun and shot ProtagonistD 
 ProtagonistB did n't think twice about it , and ProtagonistB did n't regret it either 
 After that , ProtagonistB went back to ProtagonistC and told ProtagonistC what ProtagonistB had done 
 ProtagonistC was shocked , but ProtagonistC did n't say anything 
 ProtagonistB was a changed man after that 
 ProtagonistB was more distant and ProtagonistB drank more 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how it had led ProtagonistA to this moment 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 The grocery store employees would sometimes give ProtagonistA food , but other times they would just tell ProtagonistA to leave 
 The manager agreed to hire ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA has been working there ever since 
 ProtagonistA's boss had just chewed ProtagonistA out in front of the whole office , and ProtagonistA was feeling embarrassed and angry 
 It turned out ProtagonistA had a heart attack , and ProtagonistA was lucky to be alive 
 It was so bright , and it shone between the trees 
 But ProtagonistA's eyes told ProtagonistA otherwise 
 In the middle of the clearing was a big rock , and on the rock was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was beautiful , and ProtagonistB was wearing a white dress 
 ProtagonistB's hair was long and flowing , and ProtagonistB had a crown of flowers on ProtagonistB's head 
 What was happening to ProtagonistA ? 
 They fought against both good and evil , and even in the darkest hours of the war , when their very survival depended on it , ProtagonistA kept a close watch on ProtagonistA's allies and ProtagonistA's sons 
 But not before ProtagonistA was seriously injured in the battle 
 ProtagonistA was taken to ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA's injuries were too severe , and ProtagonistA died a few days later 
 ProtagonistA's bravery and selflessness in the face of evil inspired many others to follow in ProtagonistA's footsteps and fight for the freedom of the Fox - men 
 ProtagonistA was conceived in the winter of ProtagonistA's year , seventeen months after ProtagonistA's father , Skylark of the Magic Gardens , and ProtagonistB , had met 
 This made ProtagonistA the odd one out in ProtagonistA's family , and ProtagonistA was always conscious of it 
 They looked at each other , and then ProtagonistB spoke 
 Your father and ProtagonistB were always meant to be together ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But we did n't want to rush into things 
 We wanted to make sure that we were really ready for a family 
 So we waited , and ProtagonistA were the result of that wait 
 ProtagonistA were worth it , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistA's parents ' words , and finally felt like ProtagonistA belonged 
 Some are preening their feathers , others are sleeping 
 ProtagonistA 's never been one for sitting still for long periods of time 
 ProtagonistA flaps ProtagonistA's wings frantically as ProtagonistA tries to regain ProtagonistA's footing , but it 's no use 
 The other birds look at ProtagonistA with pity as ProtagonistA picks ProtagonistA up and dusts ProtagonistA off 
ProtagonistA was exhausted 
 ProtagonistB , thank goodness 
 The one with the blue cover 
 ProtagonistA , that book is in ProtagonistA's office 
 ProtagonistB saw it there earlier 
 Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB 
 Anytime , ProtagonistA 
 Now , let 's get ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's appointment 
 ProtagonistA had been diagnosed with cancer , and ProtagonistA had made the decision to end ProtagonistA's life on ProtagonistA's own terms 
I had n't heard of ProtagonistA until ProtagonistA was gone , but ProtagonistA was exactly what I am 
 I am a person who is always looking for the next best thing 
 I get bored easily and need constant stimulation 
 I met ProtagonistA when I was working as a waiter in a restaurant 
 I struck up a conversation with ProtagonistA and we hit it off immediately 
 We became fast friends and would go on adventures together 
 We would go hiking in the mountains , exploring new cities , and just generally having a good time 
 I was devastated when ProtagonistA died suddenly of a heart attack 
 I realized then that I had taken ProtagonistA for granted 
 I will never forget ProtagonistA and I will always cherish the memories I have of ProtagonistA 
 It was so vast and blue and beautiful 
 ProtagonistA was about to go into the water to fish but ProtagonistB stopped ProtagonistA 
  What are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked 
   ProtagonistA 're not going to catch any fish if ProtagonistA do n't have a bait ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB sighed and shook ProtagonistB's head 
  Fine ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But ProtagonistB 'm not going to help ProtagonistA 
 The sun had shifted in the sky and was now shining directly in ProtagonistA's eyes 
 But in the end , the demons had been too strong and too powerful 
 They had cast a spell that had terrorized the citizens and left them begging for mercy 
  Where have ProtagonistA been ?  they asked 
 ProtagonistB was holding a canteen of water and a bag of food 
 ProtagonistB offered them to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA gratefully accepted 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's name was Sarah , and ProtagonistB had been out for a walk when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA ProtagonistA's name , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB it was ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB agreed , and they set off together 
 One day , ProtagonistA's owner decided to take ProtagonistA for a ride 
 But this time , something was different 
 ProtagonistA's owner was going too fast 
 Finally , ProtagonistA's owner slowed down and ProtagonistA was able to raise ProtagonistA's hoof to ProtagonistA's face 
 It was a little tight in the chest and the waist , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked , ProtagonistB's voice tight 
 I'm twirling ,  ProtagonistA said , still spinning 
 You're a boy ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Boys do n't wear dresses 
  ProtagonistA like this dress 
 Well , ProtagonistA ca n't wear it ,  ProtagonistB said 
  It 's not appropriate 
  What 's the big deal?The big deal is that ProtagonistA 're a boy and boys do n't wear dresses ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Now go upstairs and change into some clothes that are appropriate for a boy 
 ProtagonistA was determined to find a way to wear that dress again 
 ProtagonistA's parents and siblings had all been killed in a gruesome ritualistic murder , but ProtagonistA had been spared 
 Before ProtagonistA could scream , ProtagonistA was silenced with a knife to the throat 
 ProtagonistA's body was found the next morning , disemboweled and mutilated 
 To this day , the killer has never been found 
 It was a peaceful day , and ProtagonistA was enjoying the quiet 
 It sounded like someone was coming towards ProtagonistA 
 It was a mouse ! The mouse ran right up to ProtagonistA and stopped 
 It looked at ProtagonistA with its big , brown eyes and then ran away 
  It 's nice to meet ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 'm sure ProtagonistB 'll like it here on the farm 
  ProtagonistB was a bit hesitant at first , but ProtagonistB soon warmed up to ProtagonistA and the other horses on the farm 
 ProtagonistB loved the apple cart , and ProtagonistB would always beg ProtagonistA for an apple when ProtagonistA came by 
  ProtagonistB , what are ProtagonistB doing out here ? You know ProtagonistB 're not supposed to be in the pasture 
   ProtagonistB 'm sorry , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB just wanted to try something new 
   Well , you ca n't just go off and try new things without letting someone know 
 ProtagonistB could have gotten lost 
   ProtagonistB 'm sorry , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB wo n't do it again 
   ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB wo n't , ProtagonistB 
 Just be careful from now on , okay ?   ProtagonistB will , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB promise 
 It was a beautiful day , and the park was full of people enjoying the weather 
 ProtagonistC just stared at ProtagonistA and then got up and walked away 
It was a chilly , dark and stormy morning , and ProtagonistA was helping ProtagonistB , load ProtagonistB's car when the first hysterical hearers started peering through the panes of the neighboring windows 
 ProtagonistB had been diagnosed with a rare and incurable disease , and the doctors had told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB only had a few months to live 
 The first few days of the trip were great 
 They laughed , they talked , they made love 
 But as ProtagonistB's condition started to deteriorate , the fun turned to worry and then to fear 
 And then , on the morning of the fifth day , ProtagonistB passed away peacefully in ProtagonistB's sleep 
 ProtagonistA was devastated , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 It was a way to honor ProtagonistB and to keep ProtagonistB's memory alive 
ProtagonistA has been seen seated on the floor , ProtagonistA's heels creaking slightly , the air of a confined space , and ProtagonistA sits quietly , a slight air of nervousness attached to ProtagonistA , as if ProtagonistA were about to lose ProtagonistA's temper 
 They all have similar expressions of nervousness and anxiety 
 The group is waiting for ProtagonistB to arrive and begin the meeting 
 Maybe it 's because they 're discussing such a sensitive topic , or maybe it 's because they 're all so on edge 
 Finally , ProtagonistB arrives and the meeting begins 
 ProtagonistA's mind keeps wandering back to the last meeting ProtagonistA was in , where things had gotten out of hand 
 The meeting goes on for what feels like hours 
 ProtagonistA's mind is racing and ProtagonistA can feel ProtagonistA's temper slowly slipping 
 The bark was rough and itchy and it made ProtagonistA's hooves sore 
 But it was also cool and shady and the bark felt good against ProtagonistA's back 
 It was nice to just stand there and rest 
 It was a beautiful day outside , and ProtagonistA was enjoying the peacefulness of nature 
 ProtagonistA's heart quickened as ProtagonistA wondered what could be causing it 
 It was just a harmless rabbit after all 
 But today , something was different 
 There was a new horse in the pasture , and ProtagonistA did n't like it 
 The new horse was smaller than ProtagonistA , and it did n't seem to know its place 
 The new horse yelped in surprise , and ProtagonistA felt satisfied 
 It looked like it would be a perfect spot to camp for the night 
 It sounded like someone was coming towards ProtagonistA 
 This time , it sounded like it was coming from the other side of the tree 
 There was a bear on the other side of the tree , and it was coming towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was a girl , and ProtagonistB was smiling 
 ProtagonistB came over and sat down next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as Twilight Sparkle 
 ProtagonistA was instantly drawn to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was so pretty and seemed so friendly 
 They began chatting and ProtagonistA soon found out that ProtagonistB was also a big fan of cupcakes 
 In fact , ProtagonistB was out of cupcakes 
 And ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA could share ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was so girlish and pretty 
 It was confusing , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
The watch - thing , the one that was attached to the dress that ProtagonistA put on ProtagonistA's head , was ticking away in the dark 
 It was the only sound in the room , and it was starting to get on ProtagonistA's nerves 
  ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA still in there ?  The voice was faint and it sounded like it was coming from the other side of the door 
   Do n't worry , ProtagonistA ,  the voice said 
  I 'm coming to get ProtagonistA 
 A light came on , and ProtagonistA saw the face of ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA might need some company ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Come on , let 's get out of here 
 ProtagonistB had promised ProtagonistA ProtagonistB would be there , but ProtagonistB was always busy with ProtagonistB's royal duties 
 ProtagonistA was used to waiting for ProtagonistB 
 Finally , ProtagonistB arrived and they had a wonderful time catching up 
 ProtagonistB apologized for being late and promised to make it up to ProtagonistA 
 They laughed and talked all night , and ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had waited for ProtagonistB 
 It was beautiful 
 The sun was setting and the water was sparkling 
 ProtagonistA's friend said ,  I bet ProtagonistA ca n't skip a rock across the water 
  ProtagonistA's friend said ,  I do n't believe ProtagonistA 
 It made a beautiful sound as it hit the water 
 ProtagonistA's friend said ,  That was amazing ! I did n't know ProtagonistA could do that 
ProtagonistB was out of cupcakes 
 It had started innocently enough 
 A few cupcakes here and there 
 But then it had spiraled 
 ProtagonistB was always getting cupcakes , and ProtagonistA always wanted one 
 Finally , ProtagonistB had had enough 
 ProtagonistB confronted ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to get ProtagonistA's life together 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistB was smiling , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA for a while 
 It 's time to go , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistA 'm ready when ProtagonistB are 
 It was time to go home 
 ProtagonistA was headed to California , to start a new life 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping to make it to the next town , but it did n't look like that was going to happen 
ProtagonistA was born six months ago , and ProtagonistA was already sitting on a train headed for ProtagonistB 
 The man was snoring loudly and drooling on the armrest 
 ProtagonistA was relieved when the train finally arrived at the ProtagonistB station 
 And ProtagonistA was soaked 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 ProtagonistB was a little girl , and ProtagonistB was crying hysterically 
  What 's wrong?The girl looked up at ProtagonistA with tear - stained cheeks 
  ProtagonistB 'm lost ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 've been walking for days and ProtagonistB ca n't find ProtagonistB's way home 
 ProtagonistA's heart went out to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's name is ProtagonistA , by the way 
 ProtagonistB smiled through ProtagonistB's tears and introduced ProtagonistB 
 Then the two of them set off on the long journey home 
 It had been a dark and stormy night , and ProtagonistB had been out riding when ProtagonistB's horse had been struck by lightning and killed 
 ProtagonistB had been thrown from the horse and was lying unconscious in the mud 
 ProtagonistB had been so grateful that ProtagonistB had made ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's personal horse and had given ProtagonistA a stable in the palace 
ProtagonistB was always telling ProtagonistA to hurry up 
  Come on , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB would say 
  We do n't have all day 
 When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistB was waiting for ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to hurry up ,  ProtagonistB said 
Dave Sparkle was out of cupcakes 
 Pinkie must have gone to the royal court 
 They wore flowing white dresses , or rather , they wore dresses like they were made of paper 
 All those years of stick - figure cartoon ponies that had been created by the Evil Weasels had all been wiped out , and now there was nothing but the images of ponies hoofing around a campfire 
 None of them , that is , when ProtagonistA had the chance to show them 
 That 's why ProtagonistB always felt comfortable confiding in ProtagonistA 
 So when ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's concerns about their relationship , ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistA would listen attentively and give ProtagonistB's wise counsel 
 ProtagonistB can always come to ProtagonistA with whatever is on ProtagonistB's mind 
 ProtagonistB was relieved to hear ProtagonistA say that , and ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB could always count on ProtagonistA to be ProtagonistB's sounding board 
 Thankful for ProtagonistA's understanding , ProtagonistB hugged ProtagonistA tightly 
ProtagonistA was perched on the edge of a high bank , snapping the last few pennies from ProtagonistA's neck when ProtagonistA heard the call of an emergency 
 It was a short ride , but it always made ProtagonistA feel better to be up high , looking down at the hustle and bustle below 
 Bob ! ProtagonistA ! Come over here!It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was always friendly , and ProtagonistA had always liked ProtagonistB 
  What can ProtagonistA do for you?Oh , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB 'm so glad ProtagonistA 're here 
 ProtagonistB 've been watching ProtagonistA ride around on ProtagonistA's hoof , and ProtagonistB was wondering if ProtagonistA could help ProtagonistB with something 
  What do ProtagonistB need?Well ,  ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB 'm moving next week , and ProtagonistB was wondering if ProtagonistA could help ProtagonistB carry ProtagonistB's things down to the street 
 ProtagonistB ca n't do it all by ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB's son is too busy to help ProtagonistB 
  Just tell ProtagonistA when ProtagonistB 're ready , and ProtagonistA 'll be there 
 It was a lot of work , but ProtagonistA did n't mind 
 When they were finished , ProtagonistB turned to ProtagonistA and said ,  Thank ProtagonistA so much , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB do n't know what ProtagonistB would have done without ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 'm happy to help 
There was ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was getting frustrated and was about to leave when ProtagonistA found the item for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was so grateful and thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help 
 It was a beautiful night and ProtagonistA felt grateful to be alive 
 ProtagonistA was so captivated by their beauty that ProtagonistA forgot to continue ProtagonistA's sketch 
 They would be fine 
 It looked like they were gambling 
 After a while , ProtagonistA got bored and decided to head home 
 They were riding into the forest 
 The last time ProtagonistA 'd been here was with ProtagonistB , before ProtagonistB 'd passed away 
 It was beautiful , in a way 
 The sun was setting , and the sky was a deep red 
 ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a warm meal and a comfortable bed 
 The colors were so vibrant and the sky so clear 
 It was a beautiful day 
 It had been a long time since ProtagonistA had last seen ProtagonistB 
 They had been through a lot together , and ProtagonistA had always considered ProtagonistB a brother 
 But now , things were different 
 The things ProtagonistA had once considered important no longer mattered to ProtagonistA 
 All that mattered now was survival 
 But that was okay 
 There was work to be done 
 ProtagonistA was getting worried that it was just a trick of the light , and ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw it again 
 They were all asleep , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA's friends were always impressed with ProtagonistA's skills , but this time ProtagonistA outdid ProtagonistA 
I am not sure whether it was the pegasus or the dragon 's doggone kindness that wrapped their pinkie tracings around ProtagonistA's head as ProtagonistA walked through the door 
 But , either way , it was a welcome sight 
 But today , there was something different in the air 
 There was a warmth there that ProtagonistA had never felt before , and it was emanating from the dragon itself 
 And so , ProtagonistA walked slowly towards the dragon , pinkie tracings still wrapped around ProtagonistA's head , and extended a hand in friendship 
 The dragon , in turn , extended its own hand , and the two creatures touched pinkies , sealing their newfound friendship 
 It was peaceful here in the woods 
 It was just what ProtagonistA needed 
ProtagonistB eyed ProtagonistA , but had no intention of touching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB would just have to find someone else to spend ProtagonistB's time with 
 The sun was setting and the sky was ablaze with colors 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was sitting , a rabbit ran by 
 The rabbit looked terrified and ProtagonistA wondered what was going on 
 Suddenly , a fox came running after the rabbit 
 The fox was clearly trying to catch the rabbit for dinner 
 The rabbit ran for its life and the fox was right behind it 
 The noise scared the fox and it ran away 
 The rabbit was safe 
 But somehow , looking at the stars made ProtagonistA feel lonely 
 Today , ProtagonistB was working on a very important project and ProtagonistB needed to concentrate 
 However , try as ProtagonistB might , ProtagonistB could n't help but notice ProtagonistA's cute little face peeking over the edge of the desk 
 ProtagonistB smiled and reached over to give ProtagonistA a pat on the head 
 I'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB really need to focus on this right now 
 ProtagonistB breathed a sigh of relief and went back to work 
 The tellers immediately put their hands up , and ProtagonistA ordered them to fill ProtagonistA's backpack with cash 
 ProtagonistB was a man who had it all - a successful career , a beautiful wife , and two healthy children 
 But despite all of ProtagonistB's blessings , ProtagonistB was unhappy 
 ProtagonistB was always working , and ProtagonistB never had time for ProtagonistB's family 
 ProtagonistB's wife was always nagging ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB's children were always getting into trouble 
 One day , ProtagonistB had had enough 
 ProtagonistB packed up ProtagonistB's things and left ProtagonistB's family behind 
 ProtagonistB moved to a small town and started a new life 
 ProtagonistB was finally happy 
 ProtagonistB had all the time in the world for ProtagonistB's hobbies and ProtagonistB's new friends 
 ProtagonistB's family was still important to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB was content without them 
 The sun was setting , casting a red glow over the land , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA should be getting back inside before the night creatures came out 
 It sounded like someone was coming up the walk 
 ProtagonistB was carrying a large bag , and ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was in a hurry 
 ProtagonistB came up to ProtagonistA and said ,  ProtagonistB 'm sorry to bother ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB 'm looking for a place to stay 
 Do ProtagonistA know of any motels or hotels in the area?Bob shook ProtagonistA's head 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , but ProtagonistA do n't 
 ProtagonistB sighed 
  ProtagonistB see 
 Well , thank ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's time 
 ProtagonistB turned to leave , but ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB 
  Wait!The woman turned back 
 The woman 's face lit up 
 It felt good to know that ProtagonistA had made a difference in someone 's life 
 The first thing ProtagonistA had to do was find a way to get ProtagonistA's notebook out of the trunk behind the desk 
 ProtagonistA was relieved to see that it was still there 
 Now all ProtagonistA had to do was find a way to get it out of the trunk and into ProtagonistA's hands 
 The water was murky and dark , and there was a strange smell in the air 
 Plastic bags , bottles , and other trash littered the once beautiful landscape 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 This had been ProtagonistA's refuge , ProtagonistA's safe place , and now it was ruined 
 ProtagonistA was done with caring 
 ProtagonistA was done caring 
 ProtagonistA was done caring 
 ProtagonistA was met with a gust of cold wind that made ProtagonistA shiver 
 ProtagonistB was a woman , and ProtagonistB was coming towards ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been waiting for the moment , talking to ProtagonistA's grandfather , when it would happen : here were ProtagonistA's feet , well - nigh barefoot , with their unkempt , patchy hair , and ProtagonistA's hands folded under the lids , as if ProtagonistA had been carrying them for some months , so that ProtagonistA's hands should have a little more room , and ProtagonistA's fingers a little less clumsy , than when ProtagonistA was twelve 
 ProtagonistA and I were great friends , though we were not equals 
 ProtagonistB had been secretly stockpiling weapons and planning to overthrow ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC did n't believe ProtagonistA at first , but ProtagonistA was able to convince ProtagonistC to check ProtagonistB's quarters 
 Sure enough , there were weapons hidden everywhere 
 ProtagonistC had ProtagonistB arrested and ProtagonistB was sentenced to death 
 ProtagonistA was hailed as a hero and given a place of honor in the Pride 
 When ProtagonistA finally set sail on ProtagonistA's voyage , ProtagonistA was filled with excitement and anticipation 
 The journey was long and difficult , but ProtagonistA persevered 
 Finally , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's crew arrived in the new world 
 They were met with hostile natives and treacherous conditions , but ProtagonistA persevered 
 ProtagonistA was determined to find the treasure ProtagonistA had been dreaming of 
Bob should have known better 
 said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA stood on the edge of the granite threshold , as a matter of course , he're here on trial , in the middle of a war , and he're not winning 
 he're not going to be able to keep it up all night 
 But ProtagonistB's voice always seemed to find ProtagonistA , no matter how deep ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's thoughts 
 What are ProtagonistA reading ?  ProtagonistB asked , sitting down next to ProtagonistA 
 The Chronicles of Narnia ,  ProtagonistA replied , not taking ProtagonistA's eyes off the page 
  again ?  ProtagonistB sighed 
 I do n't understand what ProtagonistA see in those books ,  ProtagonistB said 
  They 're just stories 
  They 're magical 
 And with that , ProtagonistA was pulled back into the world of ProtagonistA's book , forgetting all about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's big brown eyes and ProtagonistA could see the admiration in them 
 One day , ProtagonistB 'll get ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 They sat there in silence for a while , just enjoying each other 's company 
 It was rare that they got to spend time together like this , with ProtagonistB always being busy with the farm and ProtagonistA always being out hunting 
 So , what did ProtagonistA get today ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 A deer ,  ProtagonistA replied 
  A big one too 
 That 's great ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistA 'm sure dad will be happy to hear that 
 They sat there for a while longer before ProtagonistB stood up 
 I should get back to the farm ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Thanks for letting ProtagonistB watch ProtagonistA hunt 
 ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB's walk away , then went back to ProtagonistA's hunting 
 The family 's bedroom 
  ProtagonistA , do ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA 'll be going back to school ?  the reporter asked 
  The reporter thanked ProtagonistA for his time and went on his way 
 It had been a long day for both of them and they were both exhausted 
 ProtagonistA's mind wandered as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB sleep 
 ProtagonistB had been so brave and had never complained 
 The man had a knife in his hand and ProtagonistA could see the look in his eyes 
  Oh , f - f - fucks if I kill you now ,  thought ProtagonistA , wishing ProtagonistB had not forbidden ProtagonistA to leave 
 As ProtagonistA lay there dying , ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistB and how ProtagonistB had always told ProtagonistA to be careful 
ProtagonistA's world was on fire , and ProtagonistA did not know it , but ProtagonistA knew it was the end 
 The flames were licking at ProtagonistA's feet and the heat was searing ProtagonistA's skin 
 The only thing ProtagonistA could see was the fire 
 The door was ProtagonistA's only way out 
 They engulfed ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was gone 
 It was a world where ProtagonistA could be ProtagonistA 
 They worked hard all morning , setting up the stand and making the lemonade 
 By lunchtime , they were ready for business 
 But no one came 
 Not even one person 
 They sat there all afternoon , waiting , but no one came 
 Finally , they gave up and went home 
 After all , it was ProtagonistB's hair that ProtagonistA was holding in ProtagonistA's hoof 
 ProtagonistB was so tiny and fragile 
 Over the years ProtagonistB had grown into a strong and beautiful young mare , and ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistB 
 Now , ProtagonistB was all grown up and did n't need ProtagonistA's help anymore 
 Everything was as it should be , but ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that something was wrong 
 That 's when ProtagonistA saw it 
 A large , dark figure was standing in ProtagonistA's yard , looking up at ProtagonistA's window 
 ProtagonistA's heart sank as ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was being watched 
 ProtagonistA was born in the early 1900s in a small town in the Midwest 
 ProtagonistA's father worked long hours at the local factory and ProtagonistA's mother stayed home to take care of the children 
 ProtagonistA's siblings were both older than ProtagonistA and often teased ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's daydreams were ProtagonistA's escape from ProtagonistA's reality 
 One day , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to help ProtagonistB with a job 
 The job was to pull a wagon full of hay 
 ProtagonistB had to call for help to get ProtagonistA out 
 It was a lot of work , but ProtagonistA loved it 
 ProtagonistA was given a stern talking to and told that if ProtagonistA did n't shape up , ProtagonistA would be fired 
 ProtagonistA's day just kept getting worse 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought , ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistA's co - worker come up to ProtagonistA 
 I'm fine , really 
 ProtagonistA went on dates , met some nice women , but none of them felt like the right fit 
 They got married and soon had a baby girl 
 It was a beautiful sight 
 There was ProtagonistB standing there , and ProtagonistB did n't look friendly 
  Hello , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB 'm Chord the Pestilent 
 ProtagonistB 've come for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's friends and family would often joke with ProtagonistA , saying things like ,  There 's ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA ai n't going nowhere 
 All of ProtagonistA's personal belongings were gone , and there was a note on ProtagonistA's desk from the board of directors 
 It said that they had voted to terminate ProtagonistA's employment , effective immediately 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
 ProtagonistA's friend told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had also been let go , and that the entire company was being shut down 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistA was mesmerized by the way the clouds moved and shifted 
 It was as if all ProtagonistA's worries and troubles melted away 
ProtagonistA leaned against the wall of the library , ProtagonistA's huge body pressing against the paper , ProtagonistA's hooves whinnying 
 ProtagonistA was drawn to the books , the smell of the paper , the way the light shone in through the windows 
 But the librarian just smiled at ProtagonistA and said ,  Hello , ProtagonistA 
 I 'm glad ProtagonistA 're here 
 We have a lot of new books for ProtagonistA to read 
 They were supposed to be dangerous , but ProtagonistA did n't feel scared 
 But now , there was a new threat on the horizon 
 It was a hot day and ProtagonistB was enjoying the cool water 
ProtagonistB was lying down under the wing of ProtagonistA , staring up at ProtagonistA's blue and white Pip Puff 
 The Pip Puff was so big and fluffy that it almost looked like a cloud 
 ProtagonistB felt so happy and content lying there , looking up at the sky and listening to the sound of ProtagonistA's gentle snoring 
 ProtagonistB could have stayed there forever 
 They packed their bags and set off on the long journey 
 ProtagonistA's friend was a little more skeptical , but was still curious to see what the Everfree had to offer 
 As they entered the forest , they were immediately surrounded by the thick trees and undergrowth 
 It was eerily quiet and they could feel eyes watching them from the shadows 
 ProtagonistA's friend was starting to get scared , but ProtagonistA was still excited 
 As they continued deeper into the forest , they started to hear strange noises 
 ProtagonistA's friend was getting more and more scared , but ProtagonistA was still excited 
 Suddenly , they heard a loud screeching noise and ProtagonistA's friend screamed 
 It was twice the size of a normal bear and had large , sharp teeth 
At the time , ProtagonistB was just about to head off to meet ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistB was about to leave , ProtagonistC stopped ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC said ,  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA really wants ProtagonistB to come over 
 ProtagonistA 's been talking about ProtagonistB non - stop 
 ProtagonistC think it would mean a lot to ProtagonistA if ProtagonistB came over 
 And ProtagonistC promise , we wo n't let ProtagonistB leave until ProtagonistB 've convinced ProtagonistA to come over to ProtagonistB's house 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistC was right 
 So ProtagonistB agreed , and headed over to ProtagonistA's house 
 They hung out for a while , catching up on everything that had happened since they last saw each other 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB broached the subject of ProtagonistA coming over to ProtagonistB's house 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about all the fun they would have and how much ProtagonistA would enjoy it 
 They made plans to meet up the following week 
 As ProtagonistB left , ProtagonistC said ,  Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB 
 This means a lot to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB felt good as ProtagonistB walked home 
 ProtagonistB was glad ProtagonistB had gone over to ProtagonistA's house , and ProtagonistB was looking forward to next week when ProtagonistA would come over to ProtagonistB's house 
 Hello , ProtagonistA ,  said the pilot 
  Welcome aboard the Skyway 
 We 'll be taking off shortly , so please make ProtagonistA comfortable 
 One day , a dragon attacked the castle and ProtagonistA bravely fought the dragon off 
 After the dragon was gone , ProtagonistA's subjects cheered and praised ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's bravery 
ProtagonistA , was perched in ProtagonistA's perch on the port bow of the vessel , watching the sun set over the waters of the Great Sea 
 The colors were so beautiful that ProtagonistA was almost moved to tears 
 As ProtagonistA watched , the colors began to change , and the sun began to sink lower in the sky 
 Soon , it was gone , and the sea was dark 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what was going on , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to tell ProtagonistB the truth 
 Fortunately , ProtagonistB was understanding 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was not mad , and that ProtagonistB would support ProtagonistA through everything 
 ProtagonistB knew that it would be a difficult road ahead , but ProtagonistB was there for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been ProtagonistA's rock during the tough times and had even helped ProtagonistA to accept ProtagonistA's sexuality 
 It 's about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was starving and dehydrated , and ProtagonistB had given up hope of ever being found 
 One day , ProtagonistB came across a stream 
 ProtagonistB drank from it and filled ProtagonistB's canteen 
 ProtagonistB followed the stream for miles , and it led ProtagonistB to a small cabin in the woods 
 ProtagonistB knocked on the door , and ProtagonistC answered 
 ProtagonistC welcomed ProtagonistB in and gave ProtagonistB food and water 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistC ProtagonistB's story , and ProtagonistC listened 
 ProtagonistB stayed with ProtagonistC for the rest of ProtagonistB's days 
 ProtagonistA's mom was driving the wagon and ProtagonistA's dad was walking alongside , leading the pony 
 They were on their way to the park for a picnic 
 ProtagonistB , was sitting in the front seat next to their mom 
 ProtagonistB was chattering away , telling ProtagonistB's mom about ProtagonistB's day at school 
 The light hit the ground and began to sink into it , disappearing from sight 
 ProtagonistA watched as the light vanished , then turned and walked back to ProtagonistA's house 
 It was early morning , and the sun was just starting to peek over the horizon 
 The sky was a beautiful orange , and the birds were singing 
 The creature was covered in fur , and it had a long snout 
 ProtagonistA's heart skipped a beat 
 The creature let out a loud roar , and ProtagonistA turned and ran 
 The bird flew ProtagonistA to safety , and ProtagonistA watched as the creature disappeared into the distance 
 It was the funniest thing ProtagonistA had ever seen 
 ProtagonistA was rolling on the ground , tears streaming down ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA did n't come out of the desert for no good reason ,  said ProtagonistB , as the words struck up in ProtagonistB's throat 
  ProtagonistB was just about to give up when ProtagonistB saw this oasis 
 It 's a ProtagonistA was so grateful to ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's help that ProtagonistA decided to stay with ProtagonistB and help ProtagonistB protect the oasis from others who might want to take it for themselves 
 Together , they built a small shelter and made the oasis their home 
ProtagonistA's mind was calm and ProtagonistA's body strong 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a pony , but ProtagonistA's hooves were too big and ProtagonistA's body was too bulky 
 The ponies always ran away from ProtagonistA , afraid of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was n't afraid of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB even came up to ProtagonistA and sniffed ProtagonistA's nose 
 They became friends , and ProtagonistA started visiting ProtagonistB every day 
 One day , ProtagonistB disappeared 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken and stopped visiting the ponies altogether 
 ProtagonistB was on the other side of the barrier , just like ProtagonistA 
 It turned out that ProtagonistB had been shrunk down to ProtagonistA's size , and ProtagonistB was now stuck on the other side just like ProtagonistA was 
 The two of them were finally able to be together , and they were happy 
 ProtagonistA dreamed of waking up to the sun shining in ProtagonistA's face and the birds singing outside ProtagonistA's window 
 ProtagonistA dreamed of getting out of bed and stretching ProtagonistA's arms and legs , taking a deep breath of fresh air 
 ProtagonistA dreamed of walking down the street and seeing the people ProtagonistA knows and loves , all going about their day 
 ProtagonistA dreamed of having a new job , a new house , a new car 
 ProtagonistA's hair was black and ProtagonistA's skin was pale 
  Hello , ProtagonistA's name is Bob 
 ProtagonistA 'm a photographer 
 There was a group of people gathered around something , and they looked upset 
 The dog was whimpering in pain and the people were trying to comfort it 
 The group of people were relieved to see ProtagonistA 
 They explained that they had been trying to get the dog to a vet , but it was too late 
 The dog was going to die 
 It was a long drive , but ProtagonistA did n't mind 
 The vet was able to save the dog 's life 
It was getting late , and Twilight was getting tired 
 ProtagonistB had been on the run from the law for years , and ProtagonistB was getting tired 
 ProtagonistB had been hiding out in the woods , living off the land and stealing what ProtagonistB needed to survive 
 But one day , ProtagonistB was caught by a group of men who were intent on taking ProtagonistB back to the city to stand trial 
 ProtagonistB was sure that ProtagonistB was going to die , but then the most amazing thing happened 
 A man appeared out of nowhere and fought off the men who were trying to capture ProtagonistB 
 The man told ProtagonistB to run and not look back 
 ProtagonistB did as ProtagonistB was told , and ProtagonistB made ProtagonistB's way to the farm of ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC took ProtagonistB in and nursed ProtagonistB back to health 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistC everything that had happened , and ProtagonistC promised to help ProtagonistB get ProtagonistB's life back on track 
 Thanks to the man who had saved ProtagonistB's life , and ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB was finally able to start over 
 ProtagonistB would never forget the kindness that had been shown to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB vowed to pay it forward however ProtagonistB could 
It was in the year 1763 when , in a county in western France , a small town named Vernay was formed , and the village of Neuve - Chalmers had its first residents 
 The name and the first and only dame which has ever been mentioned in the history of France , was ProtagonistA 
 In the year 1789 , the French Revolution began , and Neuve - Chalmers was one of the first towns to be affected 
 The people were angry and resentful of the way they had been treated by the monarchy , and they were determined to make a change 
 On the night of the 4th of August , a group of men , led by Bob Moodie , marched into the town square and demanded that ProtagonistB surrender the keys to the town hall 
 When ProtagonistB refused , Bob Moodie threatened to kill ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB still refused , so Bob Moodie made good on his threat and shot ProtagonistB dead 
 The town hall was stormed and the townspeople took control 
 Neuve - Chalmers was renamed Vernay , in honor of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA became known as the heroine of the Revolution 
 ProtagonistA 'd been born a woman and had always identified as a woman 
 It was a huge shock to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA eventually came to accept it 
 It was a difficult journey , but ultimately it was worth it 
 It had been a long day at work and ProtagonistA was ready to relax 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 ProtagonistB was sobbing and looked like ProtagonistB was in pain 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with tears in ProtagonistB's eyes and shook ProtagonistB's head 
  No , ProtagonistB 'm not okay ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB's husband just left ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB do n't know what to do 
  That must be really hard for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB nodded and wiped ProtagonistB's tears 
  It is ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But ProtagonistB 'll be okay 
 ProtagonistB just need some time 
 One where ProtagonistA was the king , and everyone bowed down to ProtagonistA 
 Everyone would admire ProtagonistA and want to be like ProtagonistA 
Rainbow Dash and Eeyore were laying in bed in the middle of the deserted lake floor , on a warm day in late February , when ProtagonistA came into the room and slid ProtagonistA's hooves over the sheets 
  What are ProtagonistA doing ?  Rainbow Dash asked , sitting up 
  But why ?  Eeyore asked 
  Okay ,  Rainbow Dash said , lying back down 
 And so they lay there , in the middle of the deserted lake floor , on a warm day in late February , with ProtagonistA in between them 
 A little like a strawberry 
 Pretty , even with a thin layer of frost on top 
 It was a small act , but it made ProtagonistA feel good 
 empowered 
 From there , ProtagonistA's crimes got bigger and bolder 
 But eventually , the law caught up with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was arrested and thrown in jail 
 But ProtagonistB still saw ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been gone for so long that ProtagonistA's family had given up hope of ever seeing ProtagonistA again 
 It was a miracle ! ProtagonistA's family was overjoyed to see ProtagonistA and they welcomed ProtagonistA with open arms 
 ProtagonistA even got to dance with a real live princess ! It was the best party ever 
 It looked abandoned , but ProtagonistA decided to check it out anyway 
 Finally , ProtagonistB got up and came to the door 
 ProtagonistB was an old woman , and ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB had seen better days 
 They were heading south , to the sun and the fragrant air 
 They asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA wanted to join them , and ProtagonistA did 
 The group was sympathetic , and they decided to go back and check on ProtagonistB 
 When they arrived at the farmhouse , they found that ProtagonistB had passed away 
 But they also found that ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistA a small bag of food and a note thanking ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's kindness 
 They packed their bags and headed out into the woods 
 After setting up camp , they went exploring 
 They found a stream and followed it until they came to a waterfall 
 They climbed up the rocks and took a dip in the pool at the top 
 After a long day of exploring , they headed back to camp and made a fire 
 They sat around the fire and told stories until they fell asleep 
ProtagonistB did not ask ProtagonistA to do anything , said Applejack , and it was not a question ProtagonistA had thought about thoroughly , much less questioned 
 It was true , ProtagonistB had never asked ProtagonistA to do anything , not even chores around the house 
 ProtagonistB had never asked ProtagonistA to do anything , but ProtagonistB had always supported ProtagonistA's dreams 
When ProtagonistA woke up ProtagonistA was so excited ProtagonistA had n't even remembered what had happened the night before 
 The bear just watched ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA struggled to get out 
 When ProtagonistA finally made it to the shore , the bear was gone 
 ProtagonistA was soaked and shaking , but ProtagonistA was also very lucky to be alive 
ProtagonistB had been so anxious for ProtagonistA to take ProtagonistA's first flight ProtagonistB had not known until that moment that the spell they were about to cast was for something else altogether 
 In ProtagonistB's haste to get ProtagonistA ready for ProtagonistA's big day , ProtagonistB had not realized that the other witches and wizards in the coven had other plans for ProtagonistA 
 As the spell began to take hold , ProtagonistB could see the look of terror in ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistB tried to fight against it , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistA was caught in the spell and would be used as a vessel for the dark forces that the coven worshipped 
 There was nothing ProtagonistB could do but watch as ProtagonistA was taken over by the evil spirits 
 ProtagonistB could only hope that someday ProtagonistA would be able to break free from their control and live a normal life 
The island of New - Heaven was a place of great beauty and wonder 
 It was a land of cloud - capped mountains and silent islands 
 The people who lived there were always full of adventure 
 They were a safe haven for the most prosperous of ships 
ProtagonistB watched as ProtagonistA twisted and turned , ProtagonistA's hooves shifting as ProtagonistA tried to keep the position 
 The other horses in the field had long since given up and gone to graze , but ProtagonistA was determined to get the last bit of hay 
 ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a pat on the head , understanding ProtagonistA's determination 
 It was a shock to ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA had always been careful to avoid getting pregnant 
 Four years later , ProtagonistB was born 
 ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB's ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was the light of ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB more than anything 
 ProtagonistB was the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB would often find ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's room , talking to ProtagonistA in a high - pitched voice 
  ProtagonistA , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB would ask 
 One day , ProtagonistB came into ProtagonistA's room and found ProtagonistA sitting on the floor , surrounded by dolls 
ProtagonistA's hooves were shaking 
 When suddenly there was nothing but the light of ProtagonistA's tears and the summer air 
 Now there was nothing left but ashes 
 ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA's family , everything was gone 
 ProtagonistB was watching over ProtagonistA's hooves - a delicate balance , ProtagonistA reasoned , between worry and excitement - and Shining Armor was resting on ProtagonistA's shoulder 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's crew of misfits are just like us 
 They 're always getting into trouble and never seem to have enough money 
 But they 're also the most loyal friends we could ask for 
 They 're always there for a good time or a shoulder to cry on 
 We would n't trade them for anything in the world 
 It had been a long day , and ProtagonistA was tired 
 ProtagonistA had been born in the wild , and had never known any other life 
 It felt like only yesterday that they were sitting in that field together , laughing and joking and enjoying the sunshine 
 It was a beautiful night , and ProtagonistA was feeling good 
 However , when the war came , everything changed 
 ProtagonistA was forced to flee ProtagonistA's home and take up arms against the invaders 
 It took ten years for ProtagonistA to realize what ProtagonistA was really up to 
 So that 's what ProtagonistA did 
 It was a big change , but it was exactly what ProtagonistA needed to do 
 I had seen pictures of ProtagonistA before , but they did n't do ProtagonistA justice 
 I was completely mesmerized by ProtagonistA 
 I knew I was in trouble the moment I saw ProtagonistA 
 I tried to keep my distance , but ProtagonistA was always there , always watching me 
 I could feel ProtagonistA's eyes on me , burning into my soul 
 It was only a matter of time until ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's move 
 I was right 
 I knew I should n't , but I could n't resist 
 I went with ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA led me to a secluded spot 
 That 's when ProtagonistA attacked me 
 I never saw ProtagonistA again , but I will never forget ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA's eyes were glassy and ProtagonistA's brain had no thoughts 
 The doctors said there was no hope for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's family was by ProtagonistA's side , praying for a miracle 
 But ProtagonistA was gone 
 ProtagonistA's body was just a shell 
 ProtagonistA's soul had left this world 
I am a destitute orphan living in a time of dire need , reduced to a mere child by ProtagonistA 
 I have no parents , no home , and no food 
 I am forced to live on the streets , begging for scraps 
 I am constantly cold and hungry 
 I have no hope for the future 
 One day , I see ProtagonistA walking down the street 
 I approach ProtagonistA and ask for ProtagonistA's help 
 I am so grateful to ProtagonistA 
 I know that with ProtagonistA's help , I will be able to survive 
ProtagonistB watched as ProtagonistA twisted and turned , ProtagonistA's hooves shifting as ProtagonistA tried to keep the position 
 The other horses in the field were grazing peacefully , but ProtagonistA just could n't seem to find a comfortable spot 
 ProtagonistB felt sorry for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB knew that there was nothing ProtagonistB could do to help 
Some years ago , I went to see ProtagonistA ; but that name had quite a curious meaning to me , as I had been accustomed to hear ProtagonistA use it when I went into a room where ProtagonistA lived with ProtagonistA's friends and relatives 
 I had never known ProtagonistA by any other name , and it seemed strange to me that ProtagonistA should have two 
 However , I found out that ProtagonistA's real name was Robert , and that ProtagonistA only used the diminutive when ProtagonistA was among intimate friends 
The house where ProtagonistA had lived with ProtagonistA's family had stood empty from the start 
 It was a big , old house that had been in the family for generations 
 ProtagonistA's parents had died when ProtagonistA was a child , and ProtagonistA had been raised by ProtagonistA's grandparents 
 So , it sat empty 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had a buyer for the house 
 They told ProtagonistA that they had always wanted a big , old house like this and they were excited to make it their home 
 The house sat empty for years , but it was finally going to be loved again 
 ProtagonistA had been born in the woods of the north west , and from the banks of the river it seemed that ProtagonistA was the exception to the rule 
 ProtagonistA had been either tortured or executed for the crime of attempting to escape from the jurisdiction of any superior authority 
  I can see ProtagonistA's future , ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistB was born as the son of a salaried workman in the midst of a profusion of pre - war industries of industrial importance , and who , having hung on throughout a highly successful career , has made ProtagonistA's fortune by , and in fact made ProtagonistA's fortune quite a while ago , by the methods which ProtagonistA has adopted to capitalize upon ProtagonistA's great fortune , although of late the conflict of interest which ProtagonistC enjoyed , in procuring a certain amount of capital , has become a serious matter 
Bob 's father worked hard to provide for his family and instilled the importance of a good work ethic in ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistB was old enough , ProtagonistB started working in one of the pre - war industries and quickly rose through the ranks 
 Seeing the potential for making a lot of money , ProtagonistB started to capitalize on ProtagonistB's position and soon made a fortune 
 However , lately ProtagonistB has been having some conflict with ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC is also in a position to make a lot of money , but ProtagonistC has been using some of ProtagonistC's capital to help ProtagonistB out 
 ProtagonistB is not sure if ProtagonistB wants to continue this arrangement , as it could be seen as a conflict of interest 
 ProtagonistB is still debating what to do , but ProtagonistB knows that whatever ProtagonistB decides , ProtagonistB will be successful 
There was ProtagonistA in the full light of the morning , and ProtagonistA was walking to work 
 ProtagonistA was hit by the car and died instantly 
 Nothing ProtagonistA ever did was good enough for ProtagonistA's father 
 One day , ProtagonistA's father passed away 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistA was now left with the feeling that ProtagonistA's father never really loved ProtagonistA 
 So , when ProtagonistA finally met ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was thrilled 
 Unfortunately , ProtagonistB turned out to be a psychopath who wanted nothing more than to see ProtagonistA dead 
 One night , ProtagonistB attacked ProtagonistA with a knife , intent on killing ProtagonistA 
 It was the first night of the rest of ProtagonistA's life 
 And ProtagonistA was determined to make sure that ProtagonistA would never be victimized like that again 
 ProtagonistA's family had been told that ProtagonistA was not expected to wake up , and they were making arrangements for ProtagonistA's funeral 
 ProtagonistA's family was overjoyed to have ProtagonistA back , but ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was starting from scratch 
 And ProtagonistA realized that the day ProtagonistA woke up from ProtagonistA's coma was the first day of the rest of ProtagonistA's life 
 The party was everything ProtagonistA had hoped for and more 
 There were so many people and they were all having so much fun 
 The arm was bloody and mangled , but still attached to the body 
 Bob 's father screamed in agony as ProtagonistA continued to pull and tear at the limb 
 Finally , with a final , sickening rip , the arm came free from the socket and Bob 's father collapsed to the ground , unconscious from the pain 
When you 're thrown out of a castle into the wilds of October , and there 's ProtagonistA there , and ProtagonistA has been murdered , and ProtagonistA has been hoping to be rid of ProtagonistA for a hundred years , you think the world is over 
 But then you see the light of the full moon , and you know that there are still things to be done 
 You have to find the murderer and bring them to justice 
 But first , you have to find ProtagonistA's body 
 But today , something was different 
 ProtagonistB , please get up ,  said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA took the ferry down the winding stone steps into the harbor 
 But ProtagonistB did n't move 
 ProtagonistB was wearing strange clothes and ProtagonistB's skin was a different color 
 They were laughing and joking , but when they saw ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB , they stopped 
 What 's going on here ?  one of the men asked 
 I found ProtagonistB at the bottom of the steps 
 The men hesitated for a moment , but then they came over and helped ProtagonistA lift ProtagonistB 
 They carried ProtagonistB up the steps and into the town 
 But this was different 
 This was cold , calculated murder 
 It was brutal , and it was quick 
 There was no mercy , no hesitation 
 ProtagonistB did n't even seem to care that ProtagonistA was watching 
 It was over in seconds 
 The man was dead , and ProtagonistA was left alone with his body 
 ProtagonistB was still out there , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was next 
ProtagonistA was imprisoned no less than twenty - seven times on the Disc of the Dead , and it has been since then that ProtagonistA has been allowed a solitary passage out of ProtagonistA's cell 
 But today , something is different 
 The warden comes to ProtagonistA's cell and tells ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA is to be executed 
 ProtagonistA wonders if this is finally the end for ProtagonistA 
 The executioner asks ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA has any last words , and ProtagonistA says simply ,  ProtagonistA have been in prison 27 times , and this is the 28th 
 ProtagonistA have always been allowed a solitary passage out of ProtagonistA's cell 
 ProtagonistA hope that this time , ProtagonistA will be allowed the same 
  With that , ProtagonistA is executed 
 ProtagonistA was stuck in a small town with no prospects of ever getting out 
 ProtagonistA's relationship with the love of ProtagonistA's life was on the rocks and ProtagonistA was starting to lose hope that things would ever get better 
 This was a groundbreaking work at the time and helped to establish ProtagonistA as one of the leading scientific minds of ProtagonistA's generation 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear ProtagonistC come in 
  What 's wrong ?  ProtagonistC asked 
  Nothing ,  ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA 'm just having a bad day 
 ProtagonistB trusted ProtagonistA with everything , even ProtagonistB's tongue 
 ProtagonistB realized then that ProtagonistB never should have trusted ProtagonistA , because ProtagonistA was n't real 
Slow , steady , and thoughtful , the moment ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's seat at the table , Equestrians moved through the dark and the undulating hall of the palace , picking vixens and lasses out of the crowd and casting them away to dance with the three most beautiful sisters of the Siras Academy 
 The music was low and sensual , and the air was thick with the scent of jasmine and musk 
 ProtagonistA's heart quickened as ProtagonistA watched the sisters move gracefully around the room 
 They were like goddesses 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistB , turned and looked directly at ProtagonistA 
 Their eyes locked , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart skip a beat 
 ProtagonistB smiled , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's whole body relax 
 All ProtagonistA could focus on was ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA reached ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA's hand and led ProtagonistA onto the dance floor 
 The music swelled around them , and they began to move 
 It was as if they were one person 
 They flowed together effortlessly , their bodies molding to each other perfectly 
 As the music came to a close , ProtagonistB dipped ProtagonistA low and kissed ProtagonistA lightly on the lips 
 ProtagonistA's head was spinning 
 ProtagonistB pulled away and smiled at ProtagonistA 
  Thank ProtagonistA for the dance ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB walk away , feeling like ProtagonistA had just been given the most precious gift in the world 
The House of Parliament , in the house of the Lords , had passed an act , which ProtagonistA expressly reserved to ProtagonistA , for a certain purposes , and without any previous consent of ProtagonistA , which provided , that the title of ProtagonistA , for the whole period that ProtagonistA was under the age of twenty - one years , should be , and ProtagonistA should be called , Lord Bob 
ProtagonistA was stabbed in the throat , ProtagonistA's heart ripped apart by the knife 
 ProtagonistA's killer stood over ProtagonistA , a satisfied smirk on their face 
 ProtagonistA's vision started to fade and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die 
 ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistA's wife and kids , and how they would never see ProtagonistA again 
 ProtagonistA's parents had tried everything to help ProtagonistA sleep better , but nothing seemed to work 
 They had even taken ProtagonistA to see a sleep specialist , but nothing helped 
 ProtagonistA's parents were at their wit 's end 
 One night , ProtagonistA's parents decided to take ProtagonistA for a walk around the block before bed 
 They were two blocks from the school door and three blocks from the flat that always seemed to be the last place to put ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA went to sleep 
 As they walked , ProtagonistA's parents talked to ProtagonistA about ProtagonistA's day and what ProtagonistA had learned in school 
 ProtagonistA's parents were amazed 
 They could n't believe that something as simple as a walk around the block had helped ProtagonistA sleep 
 From that night on , they made sure to take ProtagonistA for a walk around the block every night before bed 
 However , one day , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to tell ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's ministry 
 ProtagonistB listened patiently as ProtagonistA spoke , and ProtagonistB was there for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA needed ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by comets 
 But no one listened to ProtagonistA 
 They just laughed and called ProtagonistA a crazy old man 
 But no one would listen to ProtagonistA 
 Eventually , the comet did hit London 
ProtagonistA was killed in a car accident 
 It happened that ProtagonistA had six daughters , two known to the world , and two known to ProtagonistA's friends and family 
 ProtagonistA's wife , who was also in the car , was killed instantly 
 ProtagonistA's daughters were devastated 
 The two who were known to the world were forced to deal with their grief in the public eye 
 The other two were able to grieve in private 
 ProtagonistA's daughters were all very different 
 The two who were known to the world were very successful 
 The other two were not 
 ProtagonistA's death affected them all in different ways 
ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by magic 
 Then , one day , as ProtagonistA was practising a trick , something amazing happened 
 ProtagonistA's friends would always tell ProtagonistA about the time they saw a ghost , or the time their cousin 's friend 's brother 's ghost 
 It sounded like someone was walking around downstairs 
 It sounded like someone was walking around in circles 
The Emperor of the Day , who , according to the law of physics , died in the year of five thousand eight hundred and two , gave to ProtagonistA the title of Emperor , and naturally this title made ProtagonistA powerful , and this powerful so that ProtagonistA could make a bargain with anybody 
 ProtagonistB was crying and looked very upset 
 ProtagonistA's heart sank 
 Turns out , ProtagonistB had been diagnosed with cancer 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistA was supposed to be the strong one , but ProtagonistA just could n't handle it 
 They both knew that this was going to be a long , hard battle , but they were ready to fight it together 
I first met ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA was nineteen years old and ProtagonistA was working as a dressmaker in the East End of London 
 We became friends immediately , and I soon learned that ProtagonistA was one of the most talented dressmakers in the city 
 ProtagonistA's designs were elegant and ProtagonistA's attention to detail was impeccable 
 Over the years , we remained close friends , and I was always thrilled to see ProtagonistA's latest creations 
 ProtagonistA eventually moved away to pursue ProtagonistA's career , but we kept in touch and I was always eager to see ProtagonistA's newest designs 
 I was honoured to be able to attend ProtagonistA's fashion show last year , and I was blown away by the beauty of ProtagonistA's creations 
The U - boat crash into the moor was a horrific sight 
 The large ship was covered in splinters , and there was a corpse of ProtagonistA inside 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA had been murdered in some strange way 
 ProtagonistB was aboard the ship when it happened , and ProtagonistB was the one who first saw it 
 ProtagonistB was horrified by what ProtagonistB saw , and ProtagonistB knew that something strange had happened 
ProtagonistB had been battling ovarian cancer for years , and ProtagonistA had been by ProtagonistB's side every step of the way 
 It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever experienced a dream like this , and it was the most powerful one ProtagonistA 'd ever had 
ProtagonistA thought that was it then , ProtagonistA's dear friend said as ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's back on the landscape 
 Even an assassination attempt in the capital would be unlikely 
 It was a grand affair , hosted by the richest man in the city 
 ProtagonistA had been invited because ProtagonistA was good friends with ProtagonistB 
 I do n't know why he 's still alive 
 We 've tried everything 
 I know , but we ca n't keep trying 
 It 's too risky 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who they were talking about , but ProtagonistA had a feeling it was n't good 
 ProtagonistB was horrified 
 ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB's father had enemies , but ProtagonistB never thought they would go this far 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help and promised to keep ProtagonistA safe 
 A few weeks later , ProtagonistA was attacked in the street 
 ProtagonistA was beaten and left for dead , but ProtagonistA survived 
It is a month of extreme hardship for ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA can not possibly be surprised by the scene which I have set before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB is a frail woman , and ProtagonistB is struggling to keep up with the demands of ProtagonistB's husband 's estate 
 ProtagonistB has been forced to take on many of the responsibilities that ProtagonistB's husband can no longer handle , and ProtagonistB is struggling to keep up 
 ProtagonistB is not the only one who is struggling 
 ProtagonistB is grateful for the help that ProtagonistA is giving , but ProtagonistB can tell that ProtagonistA is struggling 
 ProtagonistB is worried about ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB is worried about the future 
 People would flock to see ProtagonistA play , and ProtagonistA always managed to walk away with more money than ProtagonistA started with 
 ProtagonistB's name was Ruben de Vros , and ProtagonistB lived in a far - off land 
 ProtagonistA was determined to beat ProtagonistB 
 They sat down to play , and after a long and intense game , ProtagonistA finally emerged victorious 
  ProtagonistA 'm fully aware that ProtagonistA 'm packing a bag full of pastries in case ProtagonistA run into an unusual custom in the future , and in anticipation of Croaking to find a new friend to eat with 
 It was all ProtagonistA knew 
 But now , ProtagonistA's time was up 
 The steel doors of the City - Ship slid open and ProtagonistA stepped out , ProtagonistA's left arm crossed over ProtagonistA's chest , as though ProtagonistA were about to slide into oblivion 
 It was time to leave the only home ProtagonistA 'd ever known 
 Twelve days of leave were all ProtagonistA was given , but it was better than nothing 
 ProtagonistA's wife and children were there to greet ProtagonistA with open arms 
 For the first few days , they just spent time catching up and enjoying each other 's company 
 However , on the third day , the heat of the war began to catch up with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's family did their best to comfort ProtagonistA , but on the sixth day , ProtagonistA sunk into a deep depression 
 On the ninth day , ProtagonistA's fever finally began to subside 
 At the same time , the fever of the war began to subside in ProtagonistA's mind 
 ProtagonistA's family was there for ProtagonistA through everything 
 They helped ProtagonistA heal both physically and mentally 
 ProtagonistA was brought up in the strictest principles of loyalty to ProtagonistA's country , and ProtagonistA's whole life was one long series of patriotic actions 
 ProtagonistA's country was always first in ProtagonistA's thoughts , and ProtagonistA never wavered in ProtagonistA's allegiance to it 
 ProtagonistA's parents had always been supportive , but they were also relieved when ProtagonistA finally graduated 
 They had been worried about ProtagonistA for years , and they knew that ProtagonistA was going to have to find ProtagonistA's own way in life 
 ProtagonistA's first order of business was to find a wife 
 ProtagonistA had always been attracted to older women , and ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's sights set on ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's parents were not thrilled with ProtagonistA's choice of bride , but they knew that they could not stop ProtagonistA 
 They gave ProtagonistA their blessing , and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB set off on their honeymoon 
 ProtagonistB was not what ProtagonistA had expected 
 ProtagonistB was demanding , and ProtagonistB wanted ProtagonistA to do everything ProtagonistB's way 
 ProtagonistB was constantly complaining , and ProtagonistB made it clear that ProtagonistB was not happy 
 ProtagonistA was relieved when the honeymoon was finally over , and ProtagonistA was able to go home to ProtagonistA's parents 
 ProtagonistA was determined to find ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was willing to wait as long as it took 
 One day , ProtagonistB broke up with ProtagonistA out of the blue 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken and did n't know what to do 
 It made ProtagonistA realize that ProtagonistA was better off without ProtagonistB and that ProtagonistA had a lot of great friends and a bright future ahead of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was always getting into arguments with ProtagonistA's wife and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was a failure as a husband and a father 
 ProtagonistA was always getting passed over for promotions at work and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA's boss was never going to give ProtagonistA a chance to prove ProtagonistA 
 It was called In a Sentence or an Exposition and ProtagonistA dated it for three months , noting the date in the front of the book 
 ProtagonistB was quiet and withdrawn , with a nervous air about ProtagonistB 
 They had been sitting in silence for some time , when ProtagonistB finally spoke 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB need to ask ProtagonistA a favor 
  Sure , anything ProtagonistB need 
 I need ProtagonistA to kill ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was stunned 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA imploringly 
 ProtagonistB ca n't go on living like this 
 ProtagonistB 'm in so much pain , ProtagonistA 
 Please , just end it for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was torn 
 The smaller man looked relieved 
 I'm sorry , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said , before pulling the trigger 
 ProtagonistA 've done well , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB , looking up at the heavens with a kind of dislike and a kind of curiosity 
 And ProtagonistB had always been happy for ProtagonistA 
 But now , sitting next to each other on a bench in the park , looking up at the stars , ProtagonistB felt a twinge of jealousy 
  What do ProtagonistA mean ?  ProtagonistB asked 
  ProtagonistA mean , ProtagonistA 've done well ,  said ProtagonistA 
   So ?   So , ProtagonistB 'm happy for ProtagonistA 
When we count the dead in the Town of the Rivers , we do n't really know what we 're talking about ; for these are the very rivers that flow through this important city of the British Empire , and through which , during the sixteen years of the reign of King Henry I
ProtagonistA was locked up , and ProtagonistA was not a very good man , but ProtagonistA was not stupid either 
 ProtagonistA had been hit on the head with a paperweight from behind , and was now bleeding profusely from the wound 
 ProtagonistB had been quick and efficient , and ProtagonistA never even saw ProtagonistB coming 
 One day , ProtagonistA was approached by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB needed someone who was honest and hardworking , and that ProtagonistB had heard good things about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB offered ProtagonistA a large sum of money to do the job , and ProtagonistA accepted 
 ProtagonistA was given a key to a building in the city and told to go there and wait for further instructions 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistC came out and told ProtagonistA to follow ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC opened a door and motioned for ProtagonistA to go inside 
 On the table was a pile of money 
 ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was to count the money and then put it into bags 
 ProtagonistC thanked ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA would be paid handsomely for ProtagonistA's work 
The sun sat on its apex and its smooth black slopes in a land of full greenness , with the summer air of a land of promise and promise 's bustle and its promise , the promise of the stars and the promise of the earth itself , a land where there was no sin and no hate nor any fear , where there was no man 's fault and no man 's fault 's fault , where there was no bad behavior nor any bad habit nor any bad character , where there was no evil in the eyes of ProtagonistA , where there was no evil that should escape ProtagonistA , nor any evil that should escape ProtagonistA , nor any evil or bad spirit , no Lord , no God , no God nor any spirit , near ProtagonistA or in ProtagonistA's name , or any thing that is not in ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was sitting at ProtagonistB's desk , and ProtagonistB looked up when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA 
  Come in , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Have a seat 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm sorry to say that we 're going to have to let ProtagonistA go 
  ProtagonistA was shocked 
 ProtagonistA had never been fired before 
  It 's just not working out ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm sorry 
  ProtagonistA gathered ProtagonistA's things and left the office , ProtagonistA's head held high 
 The scientist had been observing the planet for years , and the data was clear 
 The planet orbited the sun 
 The spectator had seen it with his own eyes 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA and asked ProtagonistA for help 
 ProtagonistB explained that ProtagonistB was new to the city and did n't know anyone , and ProtagonistB was looking for a job 
 ProtagonistB was grateful to ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help , and ProtagonistB was soon able to start ProtagonistB's new job 
 ProtagonistB was excited to be able to help others in the city , just as ProtagonistA had helped ProtagonistB 
 The paper told the story of a world that existed outside of ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated by this new discovery , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to find out more 
 But one day , everything changed 
 ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's job , bought a fancy car , and started living the high life 
 But it did n't take long for ProtagonistA to realize that money could n't buy happiness 
It was last Sunday afternoon , before the holiday of satisfaction , that ProtagonistA learned that ProtagonistB had been obliged to ask ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's blessing to have the privilege of celebrating the nuptial of ProtagonistB's second cousin , the Empress 
 ProtagonistA was taken aback at first , but then ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistB had always been a bit of a romantic 
 ProtagonistA's coffee was always delicious and everyone loved it 
 Everyone was wondering where ProtagonistA was and if ProtagonistA was okay 
 Eventually , someone went to ProtagonistA's house to check on ProtagonistA and they found ProtagonistA lying on the kitchen floor 
 The office was never the same without ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's coffee was the best part of the day and everyone missed ProtagonistA dearly 
 This technique allowed ProtagonistA to travel across bodies of water by using a series of interconnected rafts 
 ProtagonistA's flotilla technique quickly gained popularity 
 Other children started using it to explore their own neighborhoods 
 Soon , ProtagonistA was known as the inventor of the flotilla technique 
 ProtagonistA was even featured in a local newspaper article 
 ProtagonistA's adventures inspired others to explore the world around them 
 Thanks to ProtagonistA , the world became a little bit smaller 
 ProtagonistB ran away 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was being robbed 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB's name was John 
It was an apartment in the town on the river , and until one morning when ProtagonistA woke from a nightmare and rushed to the door , ProtagonistA had no idea what ProtagonistA had gotten ProtagonistA into 
 It sounded like someone was in pain , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do something 
 The thing was covered in blood , and it was clear that it had been torturing the person in the room 
ProtagonistB was smiling when ProtagonistA said to Dave , ProtagonistA would like to introduce ProtagonistB to ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB had been eyeing ProtagonistC since ProtagonistC arrived at the party 
 ProtagonistC was beautiful and ProtagonistB could tell ProtagonistC was smart too 
 ProtagonistB was glad when ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA wanted to introduce ProtagonistB to ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC , this is Marek 
 ProtagonistB , this is ProtagonistC 
 It 's nice to meet ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistB's eyes never leaving ProtagonistC 
 Likewise ,  ProtagonistC replied 
 They talked for a while and ProtagonistB found ProtagonistB falling for ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was everything ProtagonistB wanted in a woman 
 ProtagonistB was about to ask ProtagonistC out when ProtagonistC got a phone call and had to leave 
 I'm sorry , ProtagonistC have to go ,  ProtagonistC said 
  It was nice meeting ProtagonistB 
 Yeah , you too ,  ProtagonistB said , disappointed 
 ProtagonistB watched ProtagonistC's leave , but ProtagonistB was determined to see ProtagonistC again 
 ProtagonistB would find a way 
 ProtagonistB ran up to ProtagonistA and they embraced , laughing at the coincidence of seeing each other here 
 They chatted for a bit , catching up on old times , before ProtagonistB had to go to class 
 Just then , the office door opened and ProtagonistC walked in 
 We 've missed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB , told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB needed someone to help with the lunch rush 
 ProtagonistA was also glad to have a place to stay for a while ; ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA could stay in the apartment above the cafe 
It was the first day of spring in the year of ProtagonistA's coronation , and ProtagonistB was up at the royal court to welcome ProtagonistA to the throne ; but the weather had already turned hot and dry and the first - born were already starting to be gone 
 The court was in an uproar , with the nobles arguing and the commoners begging for food and water 
 ProtagonistB was trying to calm the people down when ProtagonistB saw a group of men on horseback , coming from the direction of the forest 
 They were covered in dust and their clothes were torn , but they were smiling and waving 
 ProtagonistB went to meet them , and they told ProtagonistB that they had found a spring in the forest , and that there was plenty of water and food there 
 They invited ProtagonistB and the other members of the court to come and stay in the forest , and ProtagonistB accepted their offer 
 The people of the court were relieved and happy to hear that there was help on the way , and they all set off for the Forest 
 ProtagonistB , it 's Ephron 
 It 's been a while and ProtagonistA 'm starting to get worried 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm sorry 
 ProtagonistB did n't realize how long it would take 
 ProtagonistB 'm almost done , ProtagonistB promise 
 Okay , ProtagonistB 
 Hurry up and finish 
 Finally , ProtagonistA's hand brushed something soft 
 It was just a harmless animal , but it had caused so much trouble 
 They had been through a lot together , good and bad 
 But when ProtagonistB passed away suddenly , it was more than ProtagonistA could bear 
 ProtagonistA was lost without ProtagonistB 
 But now , there was no one to cook for ProtagonistA 
The first time ProtagonistA let out a long whiny howl , the servant woke up ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB , came over to see what was the matter 
 When ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB knew immediately that ProtagonistA was sick 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to the vet , where ProtagonistA was diagnosed with a rare disease 
 The vet said there was no cure , but ProtagonistB refused to give up on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB did everything ProtagonistB could to make ProtagonistA comfortable , and even though ProtagonistA only lived for a few more months , ProtagonistB was glad ProtagonistB was able to give ProtagonistA a loving home in ProtagonistA's final days 
ProtagonistA should have known it , for ProtagonistA was such a fool in the beginning 
 But then one day , ProtagonistB broke up with ProtagonistA out of the blue 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken and did n't know what to do 
 But nothing worked 
 ProtagonistB was gone for good 
 Suddenly , the door opened and Bob 's parents walked in 
  What are ProtagonistA doing here ?  they asked coldly 
  This is our house , not ProtagonistA 
  We do n't want ProtagonistA here ,  they said 
  ProtagonistA was hurt and confused 
 ProtagonistA turned and walked out of the kitchen , ProtagonistA's heart heavy with sadness 
The kids who went to school in the little green hall were pretty , but if ProtagonistA had been ten years old , ProtagonistA would have known by a glance that a great deal of activity lay ahead of ProtagonistA 
 The hall was full of kids , all of them talking and laughing and running around 
 ProtagonistB's name was ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was in ProtagonistA's class 
 ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , too , and ProtagonistB came over to ProtagonistA 
  Hi , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA over to where ProtagonistB's friends were playing 
There was once ProtagonistA ; ProtagonistA was named John 
 One of these things was ProtagonistA's job 
 It was small and cramped and ProtagonistA did n't have enough space for all of ProtagonistA's things 
 This is why , when ProtagonistA was twenty - four , ProtagonistA decided to change ProtagonistA's name from Erland to ProtagonistA 
 This is why , when ProtagonistA changed ProtagonistA's name , ProtagonistA decided to move to a new city 
 But , there was one thing that was bothering ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was relieved when ProtagonistB did n't judge ProtagonistA 
 In fact , ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB liked ProtagonistA even more for being honest 
 From then on , ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA would always be honest with the people ProtagonistA cared about 
At first ProtagonistA just thought of ProtagonistA , and was happy 
 The doors of the church were open , and the light from the setting sun shone in through the windows , casting a warm and inviting glow 
 It was a small church , with a simple altar and a few rows of pews 
 But what struck ProtagonistA most was the atmosphere of peace and serenity that pervaded the place 
 Suddenly , all the worries and stresses of the outside world melted away , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA relax 
 Hello , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said in a kind voice 
  ProtagonistB 'm sorry to disturb ProtagonistA , but we 're about to close up for the night 
  That 's all right 
There was ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA's life was turned upside down when ProtagonistA won the lottery 
 I never would have guessed that ProtagonistA was serious 
 They had a rope and a chloroform rag 
 I was shocked 
 I tried to stop them , but ProtagonistA knocked me out with a punch to the head 
 When I woke up , my sisters were gone 
 I was devastated 
 I called the police , but there was no trace of them 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 And that 's exactly what ProtagonistA did 
 The shopkeeper told ProtagonistA that the painting was very special and that it was worth a lot of money 
 The shopkeeper eventually agreed to sell it to ProtagonistA for a very high price 
 It was small and had wings , and it was fluttering around in a way that ProtagonistA found quite amusing 
 The two of them hit it off immediately and became fast friends 
 ProtagonistA was especially fascinated by the fact that ProtagonistB could fly!Bob and ProtagonistB spent many happy hours together , and ProtagonistA was sad when it was time for ProtagonistB to fly back to the fairy world 
 ProtagonistA was soon taken in by the local villagers , who nursed ProtagonistA back to health 
 It was a street lamp , and it was the only thing ProtagonistA could see in the dark and rain 
 It was dark and wet , and ProtagonistA could n't see anything 
 The rain had stopped , and the sun was shining 
 It was a beautiful sight , and ProtagonistA felt at peace 
 It was going to be alright 
 The last thing ProtagonistA had to do was take down the white slacks that covered the back of the carriage 
 It was a cold , dead end , said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA put up the last of the slacks 
 People avoid ProtagonistA because they think ProtagonistA 's crazy 
 People started to notice ProtagonistA more after that 
 ProtagonistA became known as the ' banana peel guy ' , and people would point and laugh at ProtagonistA whenever they saw ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been locked up for so long , and ProtagonistA was starting to go stir crazy 
 ProtagonistA's cell was dank and dark , and the only thing to do was play ProtagonistA's guitar 
 ProtagonistA's friends were shocked and devastated 
 They all knew that ProtagonistA had been drinking , but they never thought that ProtagonistA would die from it 
 The first passage described a dream in which ProtagonistB saw a city made entirely of glass 
 The second passage described a dream in which ProtagonistB saw a man flying through the air 
 The Book of Dreams became a bestseller and made ProtagonistA famous 
 ProtagonistA was born into a poor family and had to fend for ProtagonistA from a young age 
 They had all been infected with the plague 
 Eventually , someone heard ProtagonistA and came to help 
 ProtagonistA's family was saved , but ProtagonistA never forgot the eerie quiet of the city during the plague 
 ProtagonistA was lost in the city and needed ProtagonistB to come and find ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB did , and they were reunited 
 That 's impossible , Rarity , ProtagonistA said , that 's impossible , even for great magic ! 
 It made ProtagonistA feel special and unique , like there was no one else quite like ProtagonistA in the world 
ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA for weeks 
 Finally , ProtagonistB 'd had enough 
  Time 's up , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB shouted down at ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB 'm calling the police 
 ProtagonistB tackled ProtagonistA to the ground and held ProtagonistA there until the police arrived 
 ProtagonistA's eyes were a cold , hard blue , and ProtagonistA's mouth was set in a perpetual scowl 
 ProtagonistA's peg - leg thumped against the wooden platform as ProtagonistA shifted ProtagonistA's weight 
 ProtagonistA had been born in the middle city , and ProtagonistA had never left it 
 Finally , the ship arrived 
 It was a large , imposing vessel , with a black flag flying from its mast 
 They all looked so small and insignificant from up here 
 The ship arrived at the top of the city , and ProtagonistA disembarked 
 The buildings were so tall , and there were so many people 
 It was a simple enough plan , but it would take some work 
 It sounded easy enough , but ProtagonistA knew that it would n't be 
 ProtagonistB was grumbling about everything that was going wrong in ProtagonistB's life 
 It was just ProtagonistA's nature 
 ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things , said goodbye to ProtagonistA's tour group , and caught the next flight home 
 It was great to be back in ProtagonistA's own house , and ProtagonistB was there to greet ProtagonistA at the door 
 I saw ProtagonistA hide the evidence 
 There 's no way the crime could have been committed without ProtagonistA's involvement 
 But I ca n't prove it 
 I do n't have any evidence 
 So I 'll just have to let ProtagonistA go 
Bob , a great warrior and general , had led ProtagonistA's armies to a great victory in the battle of Jerusalem 
 After the battle , ProtagonistA was exhausted , both physically and mentally 
ProtagonistA was born on a summer day , and ProtagonistA was drowned with a weakling 's mind and thin frame 
 ProtagonistA was never given a chance to live a full life 
 ProtagonistA's parents never even got to see ProtagonistA take ProtagonistA's first steps 
 They never got to see ProtagonistA grow into a young man 
 All they have is the memory of the day ProtagonistA was born , and the day ProtagonistA died 
It was not long ago , when ProtagonistA first visited the forest , that ProtagonistA had come across a herd of very lean , very short - legged geldings , without heads or tails , that were waiting for the moon to rise 
 The geldings seemed to be in a trance , and they made no sound 
 The geldings stirred and began to move 
 They walked slowly and gracefully towards the moon , and as they did , they transformed 
 Their bodies lengthened and their legs grew longer and more powerful 
 Their heads and tails appeared , and they became the most beautiful horses ProtagonistA had ever seen 
 The herd disappeared into the forest , and ProtagonistA was left alone , wondering if ProtagonistA had really seen what ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA had 
Just leave ProtagonistA alone , please , ProtagonistB said 
 The other ponies in the herd did n't understand why ProtagonistB was so protective of ProtagonistA , but they left ProtagonistA alone anyway 
 One day , ProtagonistA's parents took ProtagonistA to a special event 
 After the conference , ProtagonistA's parents asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA wanted to start ProtagonistA's own business 
 ProtagonistA's parents were very supportive , and they helped ProtagonistA get started 
 They also gave ProtagonistA some advice , and they told ProtagonistA to always stay focused and to never give up 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a white robe and had a long beard 
 ProtagonistB looked very wise 
 ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistA have a great destiny ahead of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 
  Then ProtagonistB disappeared and ProtagonistA woke up 
 The snake slashed ProtagonistA's leg , severing a lot of flesh and leaving ProtagonistA with one leg 
 The doctor said that ProtagonistA would never be able to hike again 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistA was determined to find a way to hike again 
 ProtagonistA's story is an inspiration to many people 
There was an old man on a horse , Bob , ProtagonistA , yet ProtagonistA had the heart of a man , and was very much of this world ; but ProtagonistA had neither the strength nor the patience for weariness nor for labor , nor was ProtagonistA ever mowing grass alone 
 But one day ProtagonistA was taken ill , and ProtagonistA grew weaker and weaker , until at last ProtagonistA could not even get out of bed 
 ProtagonistA's wife and children were very sorry for ProtagonistA , but they could not do anything to help ProtagonistA 
Near the end of the last century , it may be , there came as a terrible surprise to ProtagonistA , that from the first days of the world until the end of the last , ProtagonistA had not been able to reckon with one hundred and fifty millions of years 
 It seemed to ProtagonistA that the end of the world was at hand , and ProtagonistA was very much alarmed 
The venerable Menepaul of the Devil 's Church , 88th floor , and such - like members of Bob 's order as lay there , assembled in a noble room to witness the re - enactment , which was to take place on the roof of the beautiful Boston house of ProtagonistA , at which ProtagonistA was first lodged 
 The scene was to represent the original reception of ProtagonistA by the order , when , as a new and untried candidate , ProtagonistA had been subjected to a series of tests , the result of which had been ProtagonistA's unanimous election to the highest office in their gift 
 The members of the order , all clad in their ceremonial robes , took up their positions on the roof , while ProtagonistA , was conducted to the spot where ProtagonistA was to undergo ProtagonistA's ordeal 
 At a signal from the venerable Menepaul , ProtagonistA was subjected to a series of questions , the answers to which would determine ProtagonistA's fitness for the office 
 ProtagonistA was asked ProtagonistA's opinion on a variety of subjects , and ProtagonistA's replies were carefully noted by the members of the order 
 After a period of intense scrutiny , ProtagonistA was declared to be worthy of the office , and ProtagonistA was then inducted into the order with all the pomp and ceremony that was due to ProtagonistA's new station 
 The members of the order then retired to the noble room , where they congratulated ProtagonistA on ProtagonistA's successful completion of the tests 
You 're gon na eat ProtagonistB , said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA lay down on the sand , but do n't kill ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistB was three years old when ProtagonistA died 
 When ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistB was left alone in the world 
 ProtagonistB did n't know how to cope with the loss of ProtagonistA and was very sad for a long time 
 ProtagonistB do n't know why ProtagonistA said ProtagonistB's name , but ProtagonistB guess ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistB to know that ProtagonistA knew who ProtagonistB was 
 ProtagonistB did n't know ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB felt bad nonetheless 
 ProtagonistB asked the police what happened and they said it looked like a robbery gone wrong 
 ProtagonistB guess the world is just a cruel place 
 ProtagonistA loved the suspense and the scares , and ProtagonistA had always dreamed of writing a book like it ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was impressed by the professional team that had worked on this edition 
 They had really managed to capture the essence of the original series 
 ProtagonistA's heart skipped a beat 
 The figure did n't answer 
 Instead , it reached out and grabbed the book from ProtagonistA's hands 
 The figure turned and ran out of the bookshop , disappearing into the night 
 ProtagonistA was left alone , feeling shaken and confused 
 What had just happened ? Who was that figure ? And why had they stolen ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA did n't know the answers to these questions , but one thing was for sure 
 The Hogsmeade Horror Book had just become even more mysterious and suspenseful 
 It 's a funny thing , really 
 In any other part of the world , ProtagonistA would have been born a woman , and ProtagonistA's name would have been Mary 
 But in this part of the world , ProtagonistA was born a man , and ProtagonistA's name is still Bob 
 ProtagonistA 's always been a bit of a rebel , and ProtagonistA likes the fact that in this part of the world , ProtagonistA can be ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 's never felt like ProtagonistA fit in anywhere else , but here , ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA belongs 
 ProtagonistA 's even considered travelling to one of those places , just to see what it 's like 
 This part of the world is ProtagonistA's home , and ProtagonistA 's never been happier 
 ProtagonistA was used to the never - ending stream of guests and the constant bustle of the kitchen 
 It was n't until ProtagonistA saw the look on the chef 's face that ProtagonistA realized something was wrong 
 The chef was looking at the dish with a mix of horror and disgust , and ProtagonistA knew that could n't be good 
 But there , in the middle of the plate , was a dead rat 
 ProtagonistA's stomach turned and ProtagonistA had to fight the urge to vomit 
 ProtagonistA's parents had been at their wit 's end with ProtagonistA 
 They had tried everything they could think of , but nothing had worked 
 They had even sent ProtagonistA to therapy , but that had n't helped either 
 But then , one day , something changed 
 ProtagonistB was different than anyone ProtagonistA had ever met before 
 ProtagonistB was kind and sweet and ProtagonistB did n't take any of ProtagonistA's crap 
 ProtagonistB was also really pretty , which did n't hurt 
 ProtagonistB was the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would do anything for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB had saved ProtagonistA from a life of trouble and ProtagonistA would be forever grateful to ProtagonistB 
It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA , was walking in the palace garden when the water droplet that had fallen from the sky the night before came in , bobbed down and out of the bush 
 The water droplet was happy to have someone to play with and led ProtagonistA on a merry chase around the garden 
 Eventually , they both got tired and stopped to rest under a tree 
 They looked up at the sky and saw the sun shining through the leaves of the tree 
 They both smiled and agreed that it was a beautiful day 
 ProtagonistA was shocked and amazed at the perfectly calculated plot 
ProtagonistA do n't believe it ,   said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA sat down on the front steps of their house and looked down at the dusty back lot 
   It had been a long time since anything had happened back there ,   and ProtagonistA was sure that the old abandoned house was nothing but a myth 
   But ProtagonistA's friends had told ProtagonistA stories ,   and ProtagonistA was beginning to wonder if there was any truth to them 
   Maybe ,   just maybe ,   there was something back there after all 
   It sounded like someone was crying 
    Please ,   do n't come in !    it said 
 But nothing had prepared ProtagonistA for the sight that greeted ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA walked into the library one morning 
 The table was covered in papers , and it was clear that somebody had been going through them in a hurry 
 ProtagonistA had been having the same dream for weeks now and it was always the same 
 There would be people around ProtagonistA , but they would never speak to ProtagonistA 
 They would just go about their business as if ProtagonistA was n't there 
 ProtagonistA was trapped in ProtagonistA's room , in ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA did n't know how to escape 
 Suddenly , the door to ProtagonistA's room opened and ProtagonistB walked in 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with a concerned expression and asked ProtagonistA what was wrong 
 ProtagonistB sat down on the bed and took ProtagonistA's hand 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately and that it was normal to have strange dreams 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA should try to relax and not worry so much 
  There ProtagonistB is ,  ProtagonistA said , pointing to a small dot on the page 
  ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been obsessed with finding ProtagonistB ever since ProtagonistA was a child , and now ProtagonistA had finally done it 
Rolling over in pain , nodding slowly , looking up at the tree , eyes wide and eyes wide , ProtagonistB stared down at ProtagonistA , wondering if ProtagonistA was awake 
 ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistA gently , but there was no response 
 ProtagonistB felt for a pulse , but could n't find one 
 ProtagonistB's eyes filled with tears as ProtagonistB realized ProtagonistA was gone 
 ProtagonistB sat there for a long time , staring at ProtagonistA's body , until ProtagonistB finally got up and walked away 
 They were both giving ProtagonistA a hard time about the project ProtagonistA was working on 
 ProtagonistA was getting frustrated 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what else to say , said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA took the stack of papers from the man on the right 
 ProtagonistA was so absorbed in what ProtagonistA was reading that ProtagonistA did n't notice when the two men left the room 
 They looked like they were wealthy , probably from the South of France 
 The man , who must have been William Samuel Lister , called out to ProtagonistA 
 Hello there , ProtagonistA 
 That 's not a problem ,  Mr
 Lister said 
  We have plenty of food here 
 Come on in 
 ProtagonistA was relieved and followed Mr
 Lister into the farmhouse 
 ProtagonistA was shocked at how wealthy the family was 
 They must have been the descendants of a great lawyer or something 
 ProtagonistA was given a warm meal and a comfortable bed for the night 
 In the morning , Mr
 Lister offered to pay ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's work 
 This was the best thing that had happened to ProtagonistA in a long time 
 There was a flash of light and then ProtagonistA was engulfed in darkness 
 I was sitting on the couch , watching TV and eating popcorn 
 I had no idea what to say to ProtagonistA 
 I had no idea why ProtagonistA was here 
 Hi ,  I said , finally 
  Can ProtagonistA come in?Sure 
 I moved over on the couch and ProtagonistA sat down next to me 
 We sat there for a minute , not saying anything 
 I put my popcorn down and turned to ProtagonistA 
  And ProtagonistA like you 
 I was shocked 
 I had no idea that ProtagonistA was gay 
 I did n't know what to say 
 I'm sorry ,  I said 
  I do n't know what to say 
 Of course we can ,  I said 
 I was relieved that ProtagonistA had told me 
 And I was happy that I could still eat my popcorn 
ProtagonistA was standing before him , ProtagonistA's hair aflame 
 It was an accident , of course 
 But still , it was quite a sight 
 ProtagonistA's hair was always well - groomed and styled , so to see it now , wild and out of control , was quite a shock 
 The fire was quickly extinguished , but the damage was done 
 ProtagonistA's hair was singed and frizzy , and ProtagonistA was absolutely mortified 
 It was a long time before ProtagonistA felt confident enough to show ProtagonistA's face in public again 
 After all , it was just a case of bad luck 
 And besides , everyone knows that accidents happen 
 ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by them , and ProtagonistA loved nothing more than being in their presence 
 But there was one volcano that ProtagonistA had always dreamed of seeing up close : the great volcano 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled , and ProtagonistA could n't wait to get started 
 The volcano seemed to be growing 
 The great volcano was getting bigger 
 But it was too late 
 The great volcano erupted , and ProtagonistA was killed in the explosion 
It was a hot February day in the year 1826 , when ProtagonistA lay the body of ProtagonistB , to the sad and uncharitable 
 ProtagonistB had been bitten by a snake while they were out hunting and there was no antivenom 
 ProtagonistA was tempted to just give up and end it all , but something inside ProtagonistA would n't let ProtagonistA 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB was leaving ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB had found someone else 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 After a few months , ProtagonistB came back to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB had made a mistake 
 The light caught in ProtagonistA's hair , turning it to molten gold 
 ProtagonistA's shoulders were broad and strong , tapering to a slim waist 
 The world was a beautiful place , but it was also a cruel one 
 ProtagonistB had promised to come by and ProtagonistA was determined to wait for ProtagonistB 
 They embraced each other and ProtagonistA invited ProtagonistB inside 
 The Park was a beautiful , sprawling estate with a huge house at its center 
 It was in a state of disrepair , and it looked like it had been abandoned for years 
 The house was dusty and musty , and it was clear that no one had been inside for a long time 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled , and ProtagonistA went back to the Park house to show ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's find 
 ProtagonistB was very excited when ProtagonistB saw the treasure that ProtagonistA had found 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the house ProtagonistA had found was actually an old pirate 's lair , and that the treasure must have belonged to a pirate who had hidden it there long ago 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled to have found such a treasure , and ProtagonistA was excited to tell ProtagonistA's friends all about it 
 ProtagonistA had been warned not to open the envelope , but ProtagonistA's curiosity was too strong 
 It was a perfect little replica of a heart 
 And so it did 
 They had been through all the fertility treatments and nothing had worked 
 They had just about given up hope when ProtagonistB found out ProtagonistB was pregnant 
 ProtagonistB was happy too , but ProtagonistB was also a little scared 
 ProtagonistB was n't sure how ProtagonistB was going to handle being a mother 
 And that 's what ProtagonistA said when ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was pregnant 
When ProtagonistA was eight years old , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to dinner and asked ProtagonistA whether ProtagonistA would like a dog 
 ProtagonistB was so happy that ProtagonistB got ProtagonistA a dog the very next day 
 ProtagonistA named ProtagonistA's dog ProtagonistC and they became best friends 
 ProtagonistC would always follow ProtagonistA around and would always be there when ProtagonistA needed ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was taken to the hospital and was in a coma for weeks 
 The only thing ProtagonistA could remember was ProtagonistB 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was so grateful to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would never forget ProtagonistA's kindness 
Two weeks ago , in the town on the Mississippi , there lived ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was a simple man , who worked hard and never complained 
 The two men were friends , and they would often sit and talk together in the evenings 
 ProtagonistB was sad to hear this news , but ProtagonistB wished ProtagonistA well 
 A few weeks after ProtagonistA had left , ProtagonistB began to notice that strange things were happening in town 
 People were disappearing , and there was a feeling of fear in the air 
 ProtagonistB did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB had to find out what was going on 
 One night , ProtagonistB followed one of the townspeople who had been acting strange 
 ProtagonistB saw the man meet up with another man in a dark alley 
 ProtagonistB could n't hear what they were saying , but ProtagonistB saw the first man hand over a bundle of money 
 The next day , ProtagonistB went to the police and told them what ProtagonistB had seen 
 The police began to investigate , and soon they realized that ProtagonistA was behind the disappearances 
 They went to arrest ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA had already left town 
 ProtagonistB was a hero , and ProtagonistB was glad that ProtagonistB had been able to help solve the mystery 
 The sun was shining and the birds were singing 
 It was a beautiful day 
 Everything was going to be great 
 It sounded like something had exploded 
 It was coming from the direction of the city 
 ProtagonistA got dressed quickly and ran out of ProtagonistA's house 
The first time ProtagonistA bought ProtagonistB the farm ProtagonistB lived on , it was to construct a house for ProtagonistA's cousin 's pet phoenix 
 The phoenix , a beautiful creature with golden feathers , needed a place to live that would be safe from harm 
 The phoenix was very grateful and flew around ProtagonistA's farm , singing beautiful songs 
 Every time the sun set , the phoenix would fly into the house and perch on the highest point , watching over the farm 
 One day , when ProtagonistA went to school , there was ProtagonistB in the school room 
 But ProtagonistB did n't look like ProtagonistA at all 
 ProtagonistB had dark hair , and dark eyes , and ProtagonistB always seemed to be looking at the world in a different way 
 It was a deep , guttural cry that shook ProtagonistA's entire body 
 The sound was so loud and so unexpected that it woke ProtagonistB up from ProtagonistB's own sleep 
 ProtagonistB sat up in bed and looked at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB did n't know what to do , so ProtagonistB just sat there and watched ProtagonistA 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistA's crying subsided and ProtagonistA fell back into a deep sleep 
 ProtagonistB lay down and tried to go back to sleep , but ProtagonistB could n't 
 ProtagonistB was too disturbed by what ProtagonistB had seen 
 It was a beautiful day and the sun was shining 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought when ProtagonistA heard a car pull up outside 
 I forgot ProtagonistB's wallet ,  ProtagonistB said sheepishly 
 I'm sorry I left ProtagonistA alone ,  ProtagonistB said 
 Are ProtagonistA sure ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 ProtagonistB hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistB got back in the car and drove off 
 The book is called  The Catcher in the Rye  and it is ProtagonistA's favorite book 
 It is a story about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB is a very misunderstood character , and ProtagonistA can relate to ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA was sixteen , the second color started to change , and by the time ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA's hair was an entirely different color 
 The sky was blue with the crying of birds , and the light of the city 
 They were rough - looking , and ProtagonistA knew they were up to no good 
 Hey , ProtagonistA ! We want ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA tried to ignore them , but they were getting closer 
ProtagonistA was called ' calypso , ' and was carried away in the arms of ProtagonistA's mother , who , however , was not exactly like an angel ; but perhaps like a god , the same kind of god , as the sun and the moon and the stars and the whole galaxy 
 ProtagonistB had blue eyes , brown hair , and a florid face 
 ProtagonistB was tall and slender , with a long white beard and hair that was trimmed and frothy - blond 
 ProtagonistB was very proud of ProtagonistA 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was five years old , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to the park 
 They walked hand in hand , and ProtagonistA skipped along happily 
 Suddenly , a gust of wind blew ProtagonistA's hat off ProtagonistA's head and into a tree 
 ProtagonistB climbed up the tree to retrieve it , but ProtagonistB slipped and fell 
 A crowd gathered , and someone called for an ambulance 
 ProtagonistB was taken to the hospital , but ProtagonistB died a few days later 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 But ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistA a gift : ProtagonistB's love for life 
There 's ProtagonistA , and if ProtagonistB follow ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB should catch ProtagonistA , said ProtagonistB , but seemed not to be very careful 
 ProtagonistB was speeding down the road , following ProtagonistA 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB lost sight of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB pulled over to the side of the road , frustrated 
 ProtagonistB was about to give up when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA's car pulled over on the side of the road ahead of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB smiled and pulled over behind ProtagonistA 
 That is until ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was different than anyone ProtagonistA had ever met before 
 ProtagonistB was kind and caring and ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA that there was more to life than just the way things were done 
 ProtagonistA fell in love with ProtagonistB and they were married soon after 
 They were happy together and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never be content with just the way things were done again 
 The doctors had told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA's cancer was terminal , and that ProtagonistA only had a few months to live 
 Our granda said ,  said ProtagonistB ,  that ProtagonistA was the daughter of ProtagonistC ; but ProtagonistA lived before that , and has been dead many years 
  ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head and sighed 
  It is a shame , such a shame 
 A kind man 
 ProtagonistA would have made a good husband , ProtagonistB think 
 The old woman 's eyes grew distant and ProtagonistB began to speak softly , as if ProtagonistB were talking to ProtagonistB 
  They say that when ProtagonistC was just a girl , ProtagonistC was very beautiful 
 All the young men in the empire wanted to marry ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistD would only allow ProtagonistC to marry a man who could bring ProtagonistD the head of a dragon 
 Many men tried , but none succeeded 
 ProtagonistD was so pleased that ProtagonistD immediately allowed ProtagonistA to marry ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB paused and shook ProtagonistB's head again 
  But it was not to be 
 Just a few days after the wedding , ProtagonistA was killed in a hunting accident 
 ProtagonistC was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistC never married again and ProtagonistC never had any children 
 ProtagonistC ruled the empire for many years , but ProtagonistC was never the same after ProtagonistA died 
 ProtagonistB sighed and fell silent 
 ProtagonistC seemed to have forgotten that ProtagonistB was even there 
 ProtagonistB quietly got up and left , leaving ProtagonistC to ProtagonistC's memories 
ProtagonistA's parents had been through a lot in their lives 
 They had both grown up in poverty and had to drop out of school to work to support their families 
 When they met , they were both working two jobs and barely making ends meet 
 But they fell in love and decided to start a family 
 They had ProtagonistA , and they were determined to give ProtagonistA a better life than they had 
 They worked hard to make sure ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA needed , even if it meant sacrificing their own needs 
 We sold the car ,  ProtagonistA's father said 
  It 's time for us to retire 
 They had sacrificed so much for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was grateful 
 ProtagonistA was mesmerized by the sights and sounds of the bustling streets and the beautiful temples 
 ProtagonistB had been a donkey driver in China for many years 
 ProtagonistB had always wanted to see ProtagonistA grow up and have a better life than ProtagonistB had 
 The journey was long and difficult , but ProtagonistA persevered 
 ProtagonistA was immediately taken in by the kind staff and the other children 
 ProtagonistA was especially fascinated by the stories of the great emperor Qin Shihuangdi 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to visit ProtagonistA at the orphanage 
 ProtagonistB was so proud of ProtagonistA and the man ProtagonistA had become 
 ProtagonistA was pulled under and drowned 
In those days no man had any serious business to do with ProtagonistA , but , for some odd reason , at the age of eighteen ProtagonistA seemed to have gained much more importance than in any other part of ProtagonistA's family 
 Even ProtagonistA's grandparents seemed to defer to ProtagonistA more than anyone else 
 One day , ProtagonistA was sent to town to pick up some supplies for the farm 
 ProtagonistA was gone all day , and when ProtagonistA finally returned , ProtagonistA was carrying a large bundle under ProtagonistA's arm 
 ProtagonistA's family gathered around ProtagonistA , eager to see what ProtagonistA had brought back 
 ProtagonistA's family was amazed at ProtagonistA's find , and they all agreed that it must have been meant for ProtagonistA to find 
 From then on , ProtagonistA was known as the lucky one , and ProtagonistA's family always looked to ProtagonistA for guidance and advice 
A fair - faced , blue - eyed girl with a soft , slightly lisping voice , the daughter of a Brooklyn market girl and a remorseless explorer , who had short , spiky black hair and a small , round face , and was accustomed to be the last one to board the little white train at the west end of the Bronx , or at least to begin ProtagonistA's journey without any companion except ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB had been on the train for what felt like hours , though it was probably only minutes 
 ProtagonistB was the only passenger in the car , and the only person ProtagonistB had seen since boarding was ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was sitting in the front of the car , and ProtagonistB was in the back 
 ProtagonistB was getting sleepy , and was just about to doze off when ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistC get up and walk towards ProtagonistB 
 Excuse ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistC said ,  but ProtagonistC could n't help but notice that ProtagonistB 're the only one in this car 
 ProtagonistC was just wondering if ProtagonistB 're okay 
 The girl sat up and rubbed ProtagonistB's eyes 
  ProtagonistB 'm fine ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm just waiting for ProtagonistB's stop 
 Oh , okay ,  ProtagonistC said 
 ProtagonistC paused for a moment , as if ProtagonistC wanted to say something else , but then ProtagonistC turned and walked back to ProtagonistC's seat 
 ProtagonistB leaned ProtagonistB's head against the window and watched the darkness outside 
 ProtagonistB was getting sleepy again when ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistC get up and walk towards ProtagonistB 
 Excuse ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistC said again ,  but ProtagonistC was just wondering if ProtagonistB 're sure ProtagonistB 're okay 
 ProtagonistB 've been sitting there for a while , and ProtagonistC just wanted to make sure ProtagonistB 're not lost or anything 
 I'm fine ,  ProtagonistB said , a little more forcefully this time 
  ProtagonistB 'm just waiting for ProtagonistB's stop 
 Okay ,  ProtagonistC said 
 ProtagonistC paused again , but this time ProtagonistC did n't turn around 
  ProtagonistC's name 's Bob , by the way 
 What 's yours?Mary ,  ProtagonistB said 
 Nice to meet ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistC said 
  ProtagonistC hope ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's stop soon 
 With that , ProtagonistC turned and walked back to ProtagonistC's seat 
 ProtagonistB leaned ProtagonistB's head against the window again and watched the darkness outside 
 ProtagonistB was just about to doze off when ProtagonistB heard the train come to a stop 
 ProtagonistB sat up and looked out the window , and saw that they were at ProtagonistB's stop 
 ProtagonistB got up and grabbed ProtagonistB's bag , then turned to ProtagonistC 
  Thank ProtagonistC for talking to ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB appreciate it 
 No problem ,  ProtagonistC said 
  ProtagonistC just wanted to make sure ProtagonistB were okay 
 Have a good night , ProtagonistB 
 You too , ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB got off the train and watched it pull away , then turned and walked towards ProtagonistB's home 
 ProtagonistA was supposed to be a great guy , a fun guy , a guy that everyone wanted to be around 
 It was time for ProtagonistA to start fresh and ProtagonistA was excited for the new opportunities that awaited ProtagonistA 
Once upon a time there lived ProtagonistA 
 However , one day ProtagonistA's world came crashing down 
 ProtagonistA was fired from ProtagonistA's job , ProtagonistA's wife left ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's children were taken away from ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistA was lost and alone 
 ProtagonistB was kind , caring , and ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA get back on ProtagonistA's feet 
 They got married and they were happy ever after 
 But one day , ProtagonistA's life changed forever 
 ProtagonistA was visited by a god , who told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was chosen to be the protector of humanity 
 From that day forward , ProtagonistA was blessed with superhuman strength , speed , and agility 
 ProtagonistA was also given a magical sword , which ProtagonistA used to defend the world from evil 
 Together , they fought against the forces of darkness and protected the innocent 
 ProtagonistA's life was changed forever , but ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistA's humble beginnings 
The Tudor house has been a story that has been told in many different ways from the time of its beginnings 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's heir , the Princess Mrs
 Victoria , died , and the story was told in a different way 
 Some say that the Tudor house was a cursed house , while others say that it was a house of great wealth and power 
 No matter what the story is , the Tudor house has been a part of history for many years 
 They were made of the softest leather and fit ProtagonistA like a glove 
ProtagonistA was a little over a mile away , head down , arms rolled in ProtagonistA's lap 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how it had led ProtagonistA to this point 
 The living room is still full of ProtagonistA's books , ProtagonistA's favorite chair by the window is still there , and ProtagonistA's ashes are still on the mantle 
 ProtagonistB , has kept everything the same , as if ProtagonistB is waiting for ProtagonistA to come back 
 I know ProtagonistB still misses ProtagonistA terribly 
 It was only three years ago that ProtagonistA passed away , but it feels like a lifetime 
 I remember the day ProtagonistA told me ProtagonistA's dreams 
 We were sitting in ProtagonistA's living room , and ProtagonistA was telling me about all the places ProtagonistA wanted to see and the things ProtagonistA wanted to do 
 I was so inspired by ProtagonistA 
 Now , every time I visit ProtagonistA's house , I feel like ProtagonistA is still there with me , living ProtagonistA's dreams 
 So when ProtagonistA's friend came up to ProtagonistA and said ,  Nothing good ever happens without a cause ,  ProtagonistA could n't help but agree 
 ProtagonistA's friend was right - nothing good ever happens without a cause 
 If only ProtagonistA could figure out what the cause was in ProtagonistA's own life , maybe things would start to look up for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA's life changed the day ProtagonistB died 
 It was an accident , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like it was ProtagonistA's fault 
 If only ProtagonistA had let ProtagonistB go , ProtagonistB might still be alive 
 ProtagonistA was tempted to end ProtagonistA's own life , but something stopped ProtagonistA 
 In one dream , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was now immortal 
 ProtagonistA was terrified at first , but ProtagonistA slowly started to accept ProtagonistA's new reality 
The court papers in the office of ProtagonistA , dated May 6 , 1795 , showed that ProtagonistB , had put the cookery of ProtagonistA on ice , in order to prevent any further vanity 
 ProtagonistB was a cold woman , and ProtagonistB refused 
 It was a beautiful meal , and it was perfect 
 ProtagonistB was shocked 
 ProtagonistB had never seen such a beautiful meal 
 ProtagonistB lifted the ban on ProtagonistA's cookery , and ProtagonistB apologized for ever doubting ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was loved by all , and ProtagonistA was always remembered for ProtagonistA's delicious food 
 It had been a long day , and ProtagonistA was just ready to relax 
 It sounded like ProtagonistB was on the phone , and ProtagonistB was crying 
 ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with tears in ProtagonistB's eyes 
  ProtagonistA 'm here for ProtagonistB 
 The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was going to bed , but now ProtagonistA was in some sort of strange room 
 The walls were made of stone , and there was a small window high up that let in a sliver of light 
 Inside was ProtagonistB , huddled in a corner 
 ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with terror in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 So ProtagonistA sat down and tried to comfort ProtagonistB the best ProtagonistA could 
The antique raven with which the little housemaids had cast a delighted guess at the location of ProtagonistA , was now perched on the masthead of the silver boat that carried ProtagonistA to the small town of Bucklemore 
 As the boat drew closer and closer to the town , the raven 's eyes grew brighter and brighter with excitement 
 It knew that it would soon be reunited with ProtagonistA 
In the year of 1358 , during the reign of ProtagonistB , was born ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was born into a poor family and never had much growing up 
 It was the voice of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB had heard of ProtagonistA's hard work and wanted to reward ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to come to the palace and work for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was resigned to ProtagonistA's fate , whatever that may be 
 But then , out of the blue , the guards came to ProtagonistA's cell and told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA could stay longer 
 They did n't say why , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA was given a bed and some basic amenities , and for the first time in a long time , ProtagonistA felt like a human being again 
  ProtagonistB 'm so sorry , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said ,  but ProtagonistB just ca n't help it 
 It 's been like this for days , and the doctors do n't know what to do 
 They say it 's some sort of infection , but they ca n't seem to get rid of it 
 It was beautiful , and it told the story of ProtagonistA's husband 's life perfectly 
In truth , for all the things ProtagonistA had , no one expected ProtagonistA to be a mother 
 When ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
ProtagonistA 's been acting like a mother ever since I left 
 ProtagonistA 's put a few things in ProtagonistA's mouth and ProtagonistA 's gone very much as a mother 
 I think ProtagonistA 's trying to take care of me and my children 
 ProtagonistA 's always been a great father , but now ProtagonistA 's acting like a mother 
 It 's really sweet 
 ProtagonistB was in the kitchen cooking dinner when the doorbell rang 
 ProtagonistB answered the door and ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB talking to someone in a low voice 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistB came into the living room and sat down next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC had been killed and that ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistC again 
 ProtagonistA's father always said that ProtagonistA was just a phase that ProtagonistA was going through and that ProtagonistA would grow out of it 
ProtagonistB partook of ProtagonistA's tea , an infusion of which was prepared for ProtagonistA by the hand of the cook of the kitchen 
 It was a most delicious tea , and ProtagonistB was quite pleased with it 
  It was nice to meet ProtagonistB 
  And with that , ProtagonistA was gone 
 The water was red with blood , and the bodies of the dead floated in the waves 
 ProtagonistA's face was black with the blood of the humans ProtagonistA had killed 
 There was no way ProtagonistA could survive this 
It was Sunday morning when ProtagonistA came into the living room of ProtagonistA's house in the Avenue of the Thames 
 ProtagonistA's wife told ProtagonistA that they had been up for hours and had already had breakfast 
ProtagonistA's head was pounding as ProtagonistA slowly opened ProtagonistA's eyes 
 The first words ProtagonistA heard were ,  ProtagonistB is dead 
 ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's best friend 
 They had been through everything together 
 The doctors said that ProtagonistA would n't be able to speak or move ever again 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 The only thing ProtagonistA could do was think about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB had to act fast 
 ProtagonistB grabbed ProtagonistA by the tail and yanked ProtagonistA out of the park 
 The other newts hissed and retreated back into the undergrowth 
 ProtagonistB laid ProtagonistA down on the ground and tried to untangle ProtagonistA 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistB managed to get ProtagonistA's body back into some semblance of order 
 ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB had to get ProtagonistA to a hospital 
 ProtagonistB picked ProtagonistA up and started to run 
 But all ProtagonistA saw was smoke and debris 
 It 's not safe 
 There was no way that anyone could have survived that explosion 
 It should be fine , Dr
 Sandor 
 ProtagonistA 's been planning this for months , ever since ProtagonistA found out about the experimental treatment 
 If it does n't 
 well , ProtagonistA 's prepared for that too 
ProtagonistA's wedding was a happy occasion 
 The air in the room was clear and free from the mists of the past 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's new wife were surrounded by their families and friends , all of whom were happy for the couple 
 The wedding was a beautiful event , and the reception afterwards was a joyous celebration 
 From the start , ProtagonistB could tell that ProtagonistA was different 
 But ProtagonistB liked ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB was determined to help ProtagonistA make friends 
 Over the next few weeks , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA under ProtagonistB's wing 
 ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA around the school , introduced ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's friends , and helped ProtagonistA feel more comfortable 
 ProtagonistB was happy that ProtagonistB could help ProtagonistA feel welcome and accepted 
 It was the first time ProtagonistB realized that ProtagonistB had a talent for making friends and helping others feel comfortable in new situations 
 It was a skill that would serve ProtagonistB well throughout ProtagonistB's life 
 To ProtagonistA , they were all the same 
 Martin every day , sit in the back pew , and pray 
 The priest asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA came to the church every day 
 The priest asked ProtagonistA what month it was 
 The priest told ProtagonistA that it was December , and that December was a special month 
 The priest told ProtagonistA that in December , people remember the birth of Jesus Christ 
ProtagonistB stood before ProtagonistA , and the breath was stilled before ProtagonistA 
 They had been friends since kindergarden , but now they were on opposite sides 
 ProtagonistB was a good man , a family man , and ProtagonistB had always been there for ProtagonistA 
 It was the only way 
 ProtagonistB's eyes widened in shock , but ProtagonistB did n't say anything 
 ProtagonistB just stood there 
After a long - desired death , ProtagonistA , the elder courtship of the wizarding world was ended by the death of ProtagonistA's son 
At every turn ProtagonistA's face grew larger , ProtagonistA's shoulders more than a foot above the floor 
 ProtagonistA's friends were all afraid of ProtagonistA , and they had good reason to be 
 One day , ProtagonistA's friends were playing a game of tag 
 They were all laughing and having a good time , but then something happened 
 ProtagonistA's foot got caught on a tree root , and ProtagonistA fell 
 ProtagonistA's friends were terrified 
 They did n't know what to do 
 They knew that ProtagonistA was strong , but they also knew that ProtagonistA was kind 
 They did n't want to hurt ProtagonistA , but they did n't want to leave ProtagonistA lying there unconscious 
 Finally , they decided to carry ProtagonistA to the nearest hospital 
 They were worried that ProtagonistA might die , but they also knew that ProtagonistA was in good hands 
 ProtagonistA's friends were relieved , and they were happy to see that ProtagonistA was okay 
 ProtagonistA 's always been there for ProtagonistA's friends , and they know that they can always count on ProtagonistA 
 And so it was that ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA sitting in ProtagonistB's room , watching as ProtagonistB writhed in pain , ProtagonistB's eyes wide with terror 
 ProtagonistB's death was a tragedy , but it was also a wake - up call for ProtagonistA 
 The group has been a success , and ProtagonistA has helped many people come to terms with their own mortality 
 The poor tenants were living in squalor , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to help 
 ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA around the flat , and ProtagonistA was shocked by what ProtagonistA saw 
 The place was a mess , and the tenants were clearly struggling 
 The tenants were grateful , and soon the flat was looking much better 
There was once ProtagonistB 
 The only thing that was in ProtagonistA was a gas station and a grocery store 
 ProtagonistB's family was the only family who lived in ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB's mom worked at the gas station and ProtagonistB's dad worked at the grocery store 
 ProtagonistB went to school online because there was no school in ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was bored out of ProtagonistB's mind living in ProtagonistA 
 The only thing ProtagonistB had to do was go outside and explore 
 ProtagonistB would explore ProtagonistA and the surrounding area 
 ProtagonistB would find new things to do everyday to keep ProtagonistB entertained 
 One day , ProtagonistB found a cave that nobody knew about 
 ProtagonistB explored the cave and found a secret room that nobody else knew about 
 ProtagonistB was excited to have found something new 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistB's parents about the cave and they said ProtagonistB could go explore it as long as ProtagonistB was careful 
 ProtagonistB was happy to have something to do 
 ProtagonistB spent everyday exploring the cave and finding new things 
 ProtagonistB was happy living in ProtagonistA because ProtagonistB had something to do 
 ProtagonistA had been brought up in a small village and had never seen anything like the big city 
 The first thing ProtagonistA did was to go to the park 
 When ProtagonistA finally came out , it was getting dark 
 ProtagonistA was lost 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA ProtagonistA's name and where ProtagonistA lived 
 ProtagonistB was very kind and ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to the station 
 ProtagonistB called ProtagonistA's parents and they came to pick ProtagonistA up 
 The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was being at the party and then everything went blank 
 ProtagonistA must have been drugged , but ProtagonistA could n't be sure 
 Someone was coming 
 ProtagonistA was paralyzed with fear 
 Until one day , when ProtagonistA came home and found ProtagonistA's husband and child in the kitchen , laughing and happy together 
 It was too much for ProtagonistA to take , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to go 
 It was the hardest thing ProtagonistA had ever done , but ProtagonistA knew it was for the best 
The first time I saw ProtagonistA ProtagonistA was in a corridor of the saloon of the house on Heffernan Street , in the midst of Barnes ' Market 
 It was a warm day and the market was bustling with people 
 I walked over to ProtagonistA and we began talking 
 We talked for hours , and I soon found out that ProtagonistA was one of the most interesting people I had ever met 
 I invited ProtagonistA to stay with me , and ProtagonistA accepted 
 I will never forget the first time I saw ProtagonistA 
The boy in the striped tunic , who had looked almost exactly like a man , when ProtagonistA was five inches long , and five inches tall , and had fair hair , looked exactly like Bob , and in fact looked a great deal like a woman , at the time of ProtagonistA's first conception 
 ProtagonistB had been very beautiful , and very young , and ProtagonistB had died when ProtagonistA was only a few days old 
 ProtagonistC had been a very old man , and ProtagonistC had died when ProtagonistA was two years old 
 ProtagonistA had been brought up by ProtagonistA's grandparents , and ProtagonistA had never known ProtagonistB or ProtagonistC 
 When ProtagonistA was five years old , ProtagonistA's grandfather had died , and ProtagonistA's grandmother had died when ProtagonistA was seven 
 ProtagonistA had been sent to live in an orphanage then , and ProtagonistA had never seen ProtagonistA's grandparents ' house again 
The picture of ProtagonistA , has been printed so many times , and is so familiar to us , that it is difficult to find out exactly what made it come to be 
 And to ProtagonistA's surprise , ProtagonistA won ! The prize was a professional camera , and a year 's subscription to a photography magazine 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled , and ProtagonistA decided to use ProtagonistA's prize to start a new career as a professional photographer 
 And that 's how the picture of ProtagonistA became so famous 
 It all started with a simple self - portrait that ProtagonistA took with a new camera 
 Who knows what would have happened if ProtagonistA had n't taken that picture ? 
 ProtagonistB had become a liability and ProtagonistA could n't take that risk 
 ProtagonistB gasped and ProtagonistA felt a pang of regret , but ProtagonistA knew it had to be done 
 It was a shame , really 
 ProtagonistB had been a good kid 
 But sometimes , tough decisions had to be made 
ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's early twenty - first year , had , in fact , the least to do , of all ProtagonistB's ladies of ProtagonistA's age , in the establishment of a palace for them at the point where the river Styx flows into the Thrym - yard 
 ProtagonistA had been sent there by the Queen with a small retinue of servants and a few handmaidens to help set up the household 
 The place was already prepared for them , with a large house and outbuildings , a garden , and a stable 
 The Queen had told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was to be the head of the household and that ProtagonistA's first task was to find a suitable husband for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC was a bit older than ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistC would be a good match for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC's name was John , and ProtagonistC was the son of a lord 
 ProtagonistC was a bit shy , but ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistC would be good for ProtagonistB 
 The wedding was a grand affair , and all of ProtagonistB's ladies were in attendance 
 It was a beautiful sight 
ProtagonistA was born and ProtagonistA was a boy , but ProtagonistA looked as if ProtagonistA had been shot 
 ProtagonistB was horrified when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's father was angry 
 The doctors said that there was nothing wrong with ProtagonistA and that ProtagonistA would be fine , but ProtagonistA's parents did n't believe them 
 They took ProtagonistA to a specialist who said that ProtagonistA had a rare condition that caused ProtagonistA to look like ProtagonistA had been shot 
 ProtagonistA's parents were relieved and they decided to keep ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's friends were devastated 
 They could n't believe that ProtagonistA was gone so suddenly 
 ProtagonistA's death was a shock to everyone who knew ProtagonistA 
 It was disorienting , because ProtagonistA did n't remember going to bed 
 The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was reading in ProtagonistA's living room 
 The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was reading , but ProtagonistA's book was on the coffee table where ProtagonistA had left it 
 ProtagonistA's furniture was gone 
 It was like someone had just taken everything away while ProtagonistA was sleeping 
 It was a very sordid and infamous memory that ProtagonistA held onto 
 ProtagonistB always felt guilty about what ProtagonistB had done and tried to make it up to ProtagonistA in any way ProtagonistB could 
 One day , while they were out fishing in their boat , ProtagonistB had a heart attack and died 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistA was still getting used to living alone 
 It had been a tough few months , but ProtagonistA was slowly starting to feel like ProtagonistA again 
 It was good to see ProtagonistA smiling again 
 They had a small farm and a few cows 
 The town was growing quickly and soon there were many families living there 
 The Davis family followed nearly exactly the same course as that of the general population 
 They had their ups and downs , but overall they were happy and content 
 One of the biggest changes in their lives came when the town got its first school 
 Bob and Isaac sent their children to school and they quickly learned and excelled 
 The Davis family was proud to be a part of the growing town of Springfield 
 The secret was that ProtagonistA could turn invisible at will 
 But ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the idea of being able to disappear and go anywhere ProtagonistA wanted without being seen 
 The first few days at boarding school were tough for ProtagonistA 
 One day , while ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends were exploring the school grounds , they came across ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was muttering to ProtagonistB and seemed to be in a world of ProtagonistB's own 
 ProtagonistA's friends were scared and wanted to run away , but ProtagonistA felt sorry for ProtagonistB and decided to help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB replied that ProtagonistB was looking for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's heart skipped a beat 
 Could ProtagonistB somehow know about ProtagonistA's secret ability?The man went on to say that ProtagonistB had been searching for years for someone with this ability , as ProtagonistB believed that they could help ProtagonistB with a very important mission 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA would be willing to help ProtagonistB 
 The doctor did some tests and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had a brain tumor 
 The doctor told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to have surgery to remove the tumor 
 The surgery was a success , but ProtagonistA died a few days later from complications 
 ProtagonistA's family was devastated 
 They knew that ProtagonistA had been in a lot of pain , but they never expected ProtagonistA to die 
 They were both enjoying their meal when they heard a commotion coming from the lower end of the city 
 They both got up to see what was going on and saw a group of people running towards them 
 ProtagonistA's cousin said that they should go see what was going on , but ProtagonistA was hesitant 
 But ProtagonistA's cousin was insistent and eventually ProtagonistA relented 
 They made their way down to the lower end of the city and saw that a group of people were attacking ProtagonistB 
 They were beating ProtagonistB and kicking ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's cousin ran towards ProtagonistB to help ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA stayed back 
 But ProtagonistA's cousin was able to help ProtagonistB and eventually the attackers ran off 
 ProtagonistB was badly injured and ProtagonistA's cousin stayed with ProtagonistB to help ProtagonistB 
 It was during these dark nights that ProtagonistB would find ProtagonistA in the kitchen , eating whatever ProtagonistA could find , or in ProtagonistA's room , tearing at ProtagonistA's clothes and hair 
 ProtagonistB would try to talk to ProtagonistA , to reason with ProtagonistA , but it was as if ProtagonistA could n't hear ProtagonistB 
 It was during one of these dark nights that ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA in the kitchen , ProtagonistA's face covered in blood 
 ProtagonistB screamed when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA turned to look at ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's green eyes 
 ProtagonistB could see the madness in them , and ProtagonistB knew that there was nothing ProtagonistB could do to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB turned and ran from the kitchen , and ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB could hear ProtagonistA's footsteps behind ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was going to kill ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB ran into ProtagonistB's bedroom and locked the door , but ProtagonistA was already inside 
 ProtagonistB fought against ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB was no match for ProtagonistA's strength 
 ProtagonistB could feel ProtagonistB's life slipping away , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB was going to die 
 ProtagonistA let ProtagonistB go and ProtagonistB fell to the floor , gasping for breath 
 ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistA go downstairs and out the front door 
 ProtagonistB lay there for a moment , trying to catch ProtagonistB's breath , and then ProtagonistB got up and ran to the window 
 ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA walking down the street , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was going to kill again 
ProtagonistB had not expected to find ProtagonistA dead 
 ProtagonistB had been out for a walk in the woods when ProtagonistB came across ProtagonistA's body 
 ProtagonistA was lying on the ground , ProtagonistA's eyes open and staring up at the sky 
 There was a large pool of blood around ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistB did not know what to do 
 ProtagonistB stood there for a moment , unsure of what to do 
 Then ProtagonistB turned and ran back the way ProtagonistB had come 
 ProtagonistB did not want to be the one who found the body of ProtagonistA 
 This particular Sunday was special to ProtagonistA 
 It was the first Sunday in June , and the first thing the sun saw when it rose was that glinting spear of ProtagonistA in the distance 
 ProtagonistA was called Der Runde because ProtagonistA was always so cheerful and round 
 But then , out from the bushes , a rabbit hopped into the open 
 But a rabbit was nothing to ProtagonistA 
 It was still warm from sleeping in the bushes 
 It was amazing to see 
The ghost of ProtagonistA towered over the room 
 His eyes were glowing red and his mouth was open in a silent scream 
 The other ghosts in the room were cowering in fear 
 The other ghosts had had enough of ProtagonistA's bullying and they were going to do something about it 
 They surrounded ProtagonistA and began to haunt ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was soon reduced to a quivering mass of terror 
 They were going to make ProtagonistA pay for all the pain and suffering ProtagonistA had caused them 
ProtagonistA had been debating all day whether ProtagonistA wanted to go to the country inn or ProtagonistB's house 
 ProtagonistB was everything ProtagonistA had ever wanted in a man and more 
 ProtagonistB was kind , gentle , and loving , and ProtagonistB promised to always be faithful to ProtagonistA 
 For several years , everything was perfect between them 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken and devastated 
 ProtagonistB always had a smile on ProtagonistB's face and was always willing to help others 
 One day , when ProtagonistB was out playing with ProtagonistB's friends , ProtagonistB was hit by a car and killed 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 So that 's what ProtagonistA did 
The night ProtagonistA vanished was the night when ProtagonistA shared ProtagonistA's bed with ProtagonistB 
 It was also the night when ProtagonistB vanished 
 That 's why ProtagonistB did n't hesitate when ProtagonistA asked if ProtagonistB could share ProtagonistB's bed 
 But when ProtagonistB woke up the next morning , ProtagonistA was gone 
 There was no trace of ProtagonistA anywhere 
 ProtagonistB searched for ProtagonistA for weeks , but ProtagonistA was never seen again 
 Some people say that ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB both vanished into thin air 
 Others say that they were abducted by aliens 
 But no one knows for sure what happened to them 
 ProtagonistA was getting ready to retire , and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's wife had decided to move to Florida 
 They had sold their house and most of their belongings , and were planning to live off of ProtagonistA's pension 
 ProtagonistA's wife had died a few years before , and ProtagonistA was looking forward to finally being able to relax and enjoy ProtagonistA's retirement 
 When ProtagonistA got the call that ProtagonistB had died , ProtagonistA was shocked 
 ProtagonistC was all grown up now , and ProtagonistC was beautiful 
 They hugged each other and cried , and ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had come to the funeral 
 It was the last time they saw each other 
On Tuesday , Mr
 Bligh came to me at home with the news that ProtagonistA had been admitted into the College of the Holy - McPherson Priory , and that it would be five years before ProtagonistA would be able to see ProtagonistB 
 I was so excited for ProtagonistA and could n't wait to tell ProtagonistB the good news 
 I knew ProtagonistB would be just as excited as I was 
It was a cold , windless day , and it was almost the middle of the year , and ProtagonistA lay in bed , like everything else was wrong , and ProtagonistA had a headache , and three inches of ProtagonistA's nose was already gone 
 The doctors said that it was just a cold , but ProtagonistA knew that something was wrong 
 It landed on ProtagonistA's bed and looked at ProtagonistA with its bright eyes 
 It chirped softly in ProtagonistA's ear and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's headache disappearing 
 It was a small shadow , about the size of a cat 
 So when ProtagonistA was admitted into the College of the Holy McPherson Priory , ProtagonistB was not surprised 
 But ProtagonistB was disappointed that ProtagonistB would not be able to see ProtagonistA for five years 
 Bligh had come to ProtagonistB with the news , and ProtagonistB was grateful to him for keeping ProtagonistB informed 
 But ProtagonistB could not help feeling a little sad 
 Now ProtagonistB would have to wait five years to see ProtagonistA again 
 But ProtagonistB was happy for ProtagonistA , and knew that ProtagonistA would do great things at the college 
Alive , eight days after the death of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA sat down to choose a subject of conversation with ProtagonistA's neighbour - the world 's most eminent apothecary , Doctor Joseph Vane - the world 's greatest chocolate connoisseur of the nineteenth century , Mr
 Belvedere of the Parisian street fly- and - supplies , Dr
 John Quartermaster - of the ship - whale Squadron Heterozone of the Navy - and indeed the world - famous spectacles - in - the - air , as ProtagonistA was giving the order of concealment to ProtagonistA's revolver and was about to read out the returning message of a dramatic undertone , which the man in question had written for her:-I am coming to murder you ! Go away , madman ! ' as the prompt 
 The doorbell rang 
 Bob , who had been expecting the arrival of the postman , got up to answer it 
 Without a word , the man raised his revolver and shot ProtagonistA in the head 
 As ProtagonistA lay dying on the floor , ProtagonistA's last thoughts were of ProtagonistB and how much ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB 
 It was a joy to see ProtagonistA age gracefully and still be the same wonderful person I 'd always known 
 It was literally the worst day of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistB was a big , burly man , and ProtagonistB was in a bad mood 
 ProtagonistB started shouting at ProtagonistA , and before ProtagonistA knew it , ProtagonistA was in a full - blown fight with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB punched ProtagonistA in the face , and ProtagonistA went down hard 
 But then , something miraculous happened 
 ProtagonistB stopped punching ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistB apologized for losing ProtagonistB's temper , and ProtagonistB even offered to buy ProtagonistA a drink 
 ProtagonistA was stunned 
 But from that day forward , the two men became friends 
 They would often meet up for a drink after work , and they would talk about their lives 
It was a cold , wind - shrouded morning when ProtagonistA tucked me into bed , one full of the dread of the future , and ProtagonistA's own worries , and put ProtagonistA's trust and faith in me 
 I was only six years old , and I did n't know what the future held , but I could see the worry in ProtagonistA's eyes 
 I nodded , not really understanding , but trusting ProtagonistA implicitly 
 I would be brave 
 The next few years were hard ones , as the world around us changed and grew more dangerous 
 I did n't always understand why things were happening , but I knew that ProtagonistA would never let anything happen to me 
 And then , one day , ProtagonistA was gone 
 I was only ten years old when ProtagonistA died , but I was brave 
 I knew ProtagonistA would want me to be , so I put on a brave face for my mother and sister 
 It was hard , sometimes , but I knew that ProtagonistA would be proud of me 
 Now , years later , I still think of ProtagonistA every cold , wind - shrouded morning 
 And I am still brave 
 ProtagonistB had always been a bit of an oddball , and ProtagonistC had always been a bit of a traditionalist 
 ProtagonistC did n't approve of ProtagonistB's eccentricities and ProtagonistC certainly did n't approve of ProtagonistB calling ProtagonistA  Madam 
 One day , ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA continued to call ProtagonistB  Madam 
 ProtagonistC was taken aback by ProtagonistA's response and ProtagonistC realized that ProtagonistC had been wrong about ProtagonistB all along 
 From then on , ProtagonistC started to see ProtagonistB in a different light and ProtagonistC even began to call ProtagonistB  Madam  ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB , hesitated for a moment before following ProtagonistA's lead 
 ProtagonistB sat at the table , not quite sure what to do 
 ProtagonistB looked around the room , taking in the pictures on the walls and the knick - knacks on the shelves 
 The two men ate in silence 
 ProtagonistB , however , was not used to being silent and soon started to chatter away 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life , ProtagonistB's job , ProtagonistB's family 
 The sun was shining and the flowers were blooming 
 ProtagonistA was stuck 
 It was the best feeling in the world 
 It was worth it 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA in , and they talked long into the night 
 ProtagonistB learned that ProtagonistA was a wanderer , and that ProtagonistA had no home to go to 
 ProtagonistB offered ProtagonistA a place to stay , and ProtagonistA accepted 
 They became friends , and eventually lovers 
 ProtagonistB always wondered what happened to ProtagonistA , and if ProtagonistA ever thought of ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had only been married for three months when ProtagonistA died unexpectedly at ProtagonistA's home in Newton 
 The cause of death was complications from pregnancy 
 ProtagonistB was devastated 
 ProtagonistB was pregnant with their first child and had been looking forward to starting a family with ProtagonistA 
 Now ProtagonistB was left alone , with no husband and no child 
 ProtagonistB was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistA's death was a shock to everyone 
 ProtagonistA's death was a tragedy and ProtagonistB was never able to get over it 
I was born in a house where ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's name from the gods , and the father from the earth 
 I never knew my father , but ProtagonistA was always there for me 
 ProtagonistA was relieved and thanked the guard before ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way to the wagon 
 So , when ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's home in Maine to go to college in Boston , it was no surprise to anyone who knew ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by trains 
 The train ride was everything that ProtagonistA had hoped for and more 
 ProtagonistA made new friends , learned a lot , and had some great experiences 
 It was a journey that ProtagonistA would never forget 
 Even if it meant taking a life 
 ProtagonistB was the daughter of a rival gang leader , and if ProtagonistA did n't kill ProtagonistB's father , ProtagonistB would be forced to marry someone else 
 It was the only way to save ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was very grateful , and ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA liked the feeling of helping someone in need 
 After a few minutes , the horses slowed down and ProtagonistA was able to let go 
ProtagonistB had always been a bit odd , but ProtagonistA never really paid much attention to it 
 That is , until ProtagonistB started keeping rooks in their house 
 At first , ProtagonistA thought it was just a phase ProtagonistB was going through , but then ProtagonistB started getting more and more birds and started to neglect ProtagonistB's other hobbies 
 ProtagonistA tried to talk to ProtagonistB about it , but ProtagonistB just brushed ProtagonistA off , saying that it is what it is and that 's what ProtagonistB wants to do 
 Now , the house is full of birds and ProtagonistA ca n't stand it 
 The birds are everywhere , in every room , and they 're starting to drive ProtagonistA crazy 
 ProtagonistB tries to calm ProtagonistA down , but it 's too late , ProtagonistA 's already worked ProtagonistA up into a frenzy 
 ProtagonistB tries to stop ProtagonistA , but it 's too late , the damage is done 
 ProtagonistA 's destroyed ProtagonistB's hobby and ProtagonistB's life 's work and ProtagonistA ca n't take it back 
 ProtagonistB gasped and fell to the ground , dead 
 ProtagonistB was not dead , but merely in a deep sleep 
 ProtagonistB's spirit appeared before ProtagonistA , looking angry and disappointed 
 The damage was done 
 ProtagonistB cast a spell on ProtagonistA , turning ProtagonistA into a toad 
 And then ProtagonistB disappeared , leaving ProtagonistA alone to suffer the consequences of ProtagonistA's actions 
 First , ProtagonistA's wife had left ProtagonistA 
 It was n't ProtagonistA's dream job , but it was a start 
 ProtagonistA had been so isolated lately , and ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA needed them in ProtagonistA's life 
 Things were starting to look up for ProtagonistA 
 And ProtagonistA was determined to never give up again 
 ProtagonistA quickly told ProtagonistB what ProtagonistA had seen and ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would call the landlord 
 ProtagonistA was relieved that someone would take care of the problem 
 It was a reminder of all that ProtagonistA had lost 
 The sun had risen on a grey , smogless September day when the bombs fell 
 They were dropping bombs , and the city was being destroyed 
 Eventually , the bombs stopped falling , and the sun rose on a grey , smogless September day 
 ProtagonistB was a beautiful baby girl 
 They named ProtagonistB's ProtagonistB 
 It was a great , wonderful day 
 ProtagonistB had a dream where ProtagonistB was just a girl and ProtagonistB was walking along in the garden , and suddenly a great wickedness smote ProtagonistB , and - now this is scary ! - and ProtagonistB was flying 
 In ProtagonistB's dream , ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA's body lying on the ground , and a great black bird was flying away 
 When ProtagonistB woke up , ProtagonistB was sweating and shaking 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA had been killed , and ProtagonistB was the only one who could have done it 
ProtagonistA was born into a wealthy family in the city of Paris on the morning of February 19 , 1612 
 ProtagonistA's parents named ProtagonistA after ProtagonistA's grandfather , who was also a wealthy man 
 Christopher M
 Murrell who , on Bob 's death - bed , had permitted ProtagonistA to live in the room where ProtagonistA had been born at the time of his death 
 They continued walking along the banks of the river Thames and eventually arrived at their destination 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was destined to be a great hero , and that ProtagonistA would save the world from a terrible fate 
 ProtagonistB disappeared , and ProtagonistA was left alone in the city 
 ProtagonistB was tall and lanky , with golden hair and tawny eyes 
 Unfortunately , ProtagonistB was not excited to see ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB barely acknowledged ProtagonistA as ProtagonistB got out of the car and walked into the house 
 ProtagonistA's heart sank 
 ProtagonistB would go out with ProtagonistB's friends and come home late , barely speaking to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was hurt and disappointed , but ProtagonistA tried to understand 
 ProtagonistB finally opened up to ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was struggling with ProtagonistB's mental health 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
 They talked for hours , and ProtagonistA felt closer to ProtagonistB than ever before 
 They have a special bond that was forged through their shared experience 
 ProtagonistA had been diagnosed with a terminal illness two years ago and given six months to live 
To ProtagonistB is very nearly a treasure , and though it is not proper to discuss the disposition of ProtagonistA before ProtagonistA has attained to a certain age , I shall say that the owner of the house opposite to which I am now sitting , and of a certain age there never was a person who , till ProtagonistA had reached ProtagonistA's twenty - first birthday , could not plainly distinguish ProtagonistA – those persons were all strangers to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB , on the other hand , though ProtagonistB is not yet twenty - one , has known ProtagonistA for some years , and likes ProtagonistA very much 
 Even the teachers are afraid of ProtagonistA 
 The kid punched ProtagonistA right in the nose , and ProtagonistA ran away crying 
 The sun was shining in through the windows and the room was very warm 
 Suddenly , the door opened and a gust of cool air came into the room 
 This act created a great rift in the empire , and ProtagonistA was forced to flee 
 ProtagonistB was a wise and just ruler , and ProtagonistB saw the value in ProtagonistA's knowledge and experience 
 ProtagonistB appointed ProtagonistA as ProtagonistB's chief advisor , and ProtagonistA served ProtagonistB faithfully for many years 
 And they had two children , and their names were Cain and Abel 
 And they were good children , and they loved their parents , and they were called Cain and Abel , because they were the first children of the world 
 And they were happy , and they loved each other , and they were good to each other , and they were called Cain and Abel , because they were the first children of the world 
 This invention would help many people and make their lives easier 
 ProtagonistB was humiliated and laughed at by everyone who saw ProtagonistB 
 It is truly a magical place 
 Your fruit and vegetables are the biggest and best ProtagonistA have ever seen , and your livestock are healthy and strong 
 It is no wonder that people come from all over to trade with you 
 ProtagonistA hope that you will forgive ProtagonistA , and that we can still be friends 
 Yours truly , ProtagonistA  
Frank Wilson , an old friend and colleague of ProtagonistB's , once said ,  I am afraid , ProtagonistA , that when ProtagonistB is doing a little bit of necessary thing , you know all about it , and ProtagonistB 's got all sorts of things on ProtagonistB's conscience , but when ProtagonistB is doing all sorts of unnecessary thing , you never know what 's going on , you just know you 're used to it , and it 's when you 're doing a great deal of unnecessary thing that you really get into trouble 
Siskais will not have noticed that the very day when ProtagonistA was to enrol in ProtagonistA's first year of school , ProtagonistB had ProtagonistA sent to the London School of Economics 
 It was only when ProtagonistB received a letter from the school informing ProtagonistB of ProtagonistA's admission that ProtagonistB realised what had happened 
 ProtagonistB was overjoyed that ProtagonistA would be able to get a good education and make something of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been warned about the city , about the dangers that lurked in the shadows , but ProtagonistA had not been prepared for what ProtagonistA saw 
 The poverty , the filth , the crime 
 It was all too much 
 It sounded like it was coming from an alleyway just off the main street 
 ProtagonistB was cowering in fear , and it was clear that ProtagonistB was in trouble 
  Leave ProtagonistB alone 
 The men turned to look at ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA saw the hunger in their eyes 
 They were going to hurt ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA could n't let that happen 
 The men laughed and advanced on ProtagonistA 
 There was no way that ProtagonistA could fight all of them off 
 It was pointless 
 The man just brushed ProtagonistA aside and kept coming 
 ProtagonistA was knocked to the ground 
 The men were upon ProtagonistA now , kicking and punching ProtagonistA 
 Then , suddenly , they were gone 
 ProtagonistB had saved ProtagonistA 
 Then everything went black 
 Even ProtagonistA's teachers were impressed with ProtagonistA's intellect 
 One day , ProtagonistA's curiosity got the best of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA decided to ask ProtagonistC a question that had been bugging ProtagonistA for weeks 
  ProtagonistC , why is the sky blue ?  ProtagonistC was taken aback by the question , but ProtagonistC quickly recovered and explained the science behind it 
There 's something about that great House of Potter , the House of Black and White , that makes ProtagonistA just as well off as ProtagonistA is 
 ProtagonistA 's never been one for material things , but there 's something about the way the light shines in through the windows of that house that makes ProtagonistA feel at home 
 It 's been ProtagonistA's home for as long as ProtagonistA can remember , and ProtagonistA ca n't imagine living anywhere else 
 The other racers in the Bobsledding Championship were shocked to see what had happened , but they knew that there was nothing they could do 
 To ProtagonistA's surprise , it was accepted by one of them 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled that ProtagonistA's dream was finally coming true 
 ProtagonistA 's been writing ever since and ProtagonistA 's never been happier 
Bob was a boy who died several times 
 In the end , ProtagonistA was killed by the very people ProtagonistA had once terrorized 
 It was a feeling of complete bliss and divine presence 
 ProtagonistA's life was changed forever 
 ProtagonistA was inspired to share ProtagonistA's story with the world and help as many people as possible to find their own path to enlightenment 
ProtagonistA was born in a small town in the middle of nowhere 
 ProtagonistA was instructed by ProtagonistA's parents to be a good person and to always help others 
 ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags , said goodbye to ProtagonistA's family , and set off into the unknown 
 ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by magic and the possibilities it held , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if it was something ProtagonistA wanted to dedicate ProtagonistA's life to 
 There was a lot of hard work and study involved 
 It was a hot day and the sun was beating down on ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't mind 
 Suddenly , the front door opened and ProtagonistB came out 
 ProtagonistB was carrying a large suitcase and ProtagonistB looked very angry 
 What are ProtagonistA doing here ?  ProtagonistB demanded 
 It 's all right , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistC said 
 We 'll take care of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB hesitated for a moment , then nodded 
 All right ,  ProtagonistB said 
 With that , ProtagonistB turned and walked back into the house 
 Don't worry , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said 
  Everything will work out 
 It was a beautiful piece of art , and the two boys were fascinated by it 
 They asked ProtagonistA a lot of questions about the statue and the emperor 
 The boys were very impressed by the statue and the story of the emperor 
The last time I saw ProtagonistA was about a year ago 
 I called out to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA just kept walking 
When ProtagonistA gets the bright idea to go into the library , no one ever takes ProtagonistA up on it 
 ProtagonistA 's been going there for years , ever since ProtagonistA was a little kid , and ProtagonistA knows every nook and cranny 
 ProtagonistA 's even made friends with some of the librarians 
 But when ProtagonistA suggests that ProtagonistA's friends come with ProtagonistA to check out the library , they always decline 
 It 's a great place to relax , to learn new things , and to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life 
 ProtagonistA 's tried to explain this to ProtagonistA's friends , but they just do n't seem to get it 
 At first , no one pays much attention to ProtagonistA 
 But then , a few people stop and chat with ProtagonistA , and before long , a small crowd has gathered 
 Now , every time ProtagonistA goes to the library , ProtagonistA 's always accompanied by at least one other person 
In the midst of the streets of Alexandria , in the year 1659 , ProtagonistA , not unnaturally , but simply by habit , but the more naturally , since ProtagonistA was the son of it , took up ProtagonistA's residence in a large and commodious house in the very centre of the city , and there , like a good landlord , ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB's name was Mrs
 But one day ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA and said to ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB am going to leave ProtagonistA 
   What for , ProtagonistB ?  said ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB am going to get married , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB 
  And who are ProtagonistB going to marry , ProtagonistB ?  said ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB am going to marry Mr
 Jones , the baker ,  said ProtagonistB 
  Very well , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistB will be happy 
 ProtagonistA's body was found floating in the water , and it is believed that ProtagonistA drowned 
The air grew still as ProtagonistA entered the main door of the old office , but ProtagonistA was ready 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said ,  but ProtagonistA 'm going to have to ask ProtagonistB to leave 
  ProtagonistB gasped and ran out of the room 
 Inside was a small office with a desk and a computer 
ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's bony hands and feet enough to accommodate ProtagonistA to a load of cushions ; they made a little coffin for ProtagonistA , so heavy it contained four bales of straw 
 The funeral was a sombre affair ; ProtagonistA's friends and family all wept , and ProtagonistA was too weak to stand 
 Still , it was a shock to everyone when it finally happened 
 The first few months were very hard for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was not used to the hard work and the long hours 
 And ProtagonistA was determined to continue to succeed in this new life that ProtagonistA had chosen for ProtagonistA 
On the very day the world was to begin to change , ProtagonistA , did the most ridiculous thing that ever happened to ProtagonistA , and that is to have succeeded in changing the most important meeting of the village house into a hideous pantomime of torture , murder , and mayhem 
 The villagers were gathered around the fire , preparing to discuss the important matters of the day , when ProtagonistA came barging into the house , screaming and covered in blood 
 ProtagonistA was taken away to be locked up , and the village house was left in ruins 
 ProtagonistA's boss never had a kind word to say , and ProtagonistA's coworkers always seemed to be getting ahead while ProtagonistA stayed in the same place 
 ProtagonistA was done with this job 
 ProtagonistA was done with feeling like ProtagonistA was invisible 
 It was time to move on to something new 
 But those were things that everyone was afraid of , so they did n't really count 
 That was why ProtagonistA always tried to be so good , to keep ProtagonistA in check 
 In ProtagonistA's dreams , anything was possible 
 The world was a tough place , and happy endings were few and far between 
 It was the same look ProtagonistB always gave when ProtagonistB managed to get one over on someone 
 In this case , it was the other kids in ProtagonistA's class 
 They had been teasing ProtagonistA all day about ProtagonistA's new shoes , saying they were too big for ProtagonistA and that ProtagonistA looked like a clown 
 But ProtagonistB had told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could wear them with pride , because they were the latest style and ProtagonistA was ahead of the trends 
 ProtagonistA's curiosity was endless , and ProtagonistA loved to explore 
 This was evident from the very beginning , when ProtagonistA was born two weeks early and without any complications 
 The doctors were amazed , and ProtagonistA's parents were overjoyed 
 ProtagonistA's parents had always wanted a smart child , and they were not disappointed 
 ProtagonistA's parents were proud of ProtagonistA's accomplishments , but they were also worried about ProtagonistA 
 They knew that ProtagonistA was different from other children , and they worried that ProtagonistA would be teased or bullied 
 As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA's intelligence only became more apparent 
 ProtagonistA's parents are now retired , and they spend their days bragging to their friends about ProtagonistA 
 They are proud of ProtagonistA's accomplishments , and they know that ProtagonistA has only just begun to make ProtagonistA's mark on the world 
As the story of the life of ProtagonistA begins , we should recall that the man who first wrote about ProtagonistA , a man called Sir Walter Scott , is dead 
 Nevertheless , ProtagonistA's story is worth telling , and it begins with ProtagonistA's birth in a small town in England 
 ProtagonistA was born into a family of modest means , but ProtagonistA was always a bright and cheerful child 
 ProtagonistA's life was not all work and no play , however 
 ProtagonistA was loved by all who knew ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA will be sorely missed 
I was walking through the library when I saw ProtagonistA 
 I knew that ProtagonistA worked there , so I asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA could give me a free copy of the dictionary 
 I was so happy that I thanked ProtagonistA and took the manual 
 It was hard to tell with ProtagonistA 
 But that was part of ProtagonistA's charm , was n't it ? The mystery of ProtagonistA 
 No one could ever quite figure ProtagonistA out 
 Even ProtagonistA's closest friends did n't really know who ProtagonistA was 
 But that was what made ProtagonistA so special 
 And that was what made ProtagonistA so fascinating 
There is a place on a very small and very remote island in the Pacific where one can go into the deepest secrets of nature and find ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's commanding officer always had to yell at ProtagonistA and tell ProtagonistA off 
 One day , ProtagonistA's unit was sent into battle 
 They were outnumbered and outgunned , and ProtagonistA knew that they did n't stand a chance 
 And die ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA was shot through the heart and killed instantly 
 But it was too late now 
 ProtagonistA was gone 
Barefoot lay by the side of ProtagonistB's house in the woods of Gower , where ProtagonistA had spent the good part of ProtagonistA's childhood , weeping heartily over ProtagonistB's death 
 The sun was setting , and the woods were beginning to fill with shadows 
 ProtagonistA was awakened by a rustling in the bushes 
 The creature took a step forward , and ProtagonistA scrambled to ProtagonistA's feet and ran as fast as ProtagonistA could back to ProtagonistB's house 
 Just then , ProtagonistB approached ProtagonistA and asked if ProtagonistA needed help 
 ProtagonistB was true to ProtagonistB's word and ProtagonistA made it home safely 
There were many things that ProtagonistA said that were not true , and some that ProtagonistA said that was not true , but there was one thing that ProtagonistA said or that ProtagonistA said or did or said or said that was true 
 It was true that ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA's friend was always telling ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had a good eye 
 As a result , ProtagonistA's friend was always telling ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was a smart and savvy investor 
 This was a shock to ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA had always thought ProtagonistB was a good man 
 ProtagonistA had been locked away in a cell , chained to the wall and left to rot 
 But that was before the incident 
 ProtagonistA's eyes were sunken in , ProtagonistA's skin was pale and ProtagonistA's hair was matted 
 The incident had happened two weeks ago 
 At first , ProtagonistA had been confused , but then the memories had started to come back to ProtagonistA 
 The memories of the people ProtagonistA had killed , the blood ProtagonistA had drunk 
 And ProtagonistA had been locked away to prevent ProtagonistA from harming anyone else 
 The bite had turned ProtagonistA , made ProtagonistA into one of the undead 
 The past two weeks had been torture for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been chained up , starved , and left to suffer 
 The cell door had been left unlocked , and ProtagonistA had finally been able to escape 
 The first thing ProtagonistA saw was a human , a man , walking down the street 
 ProtagonistA's eyes widened and ProtagonistA licked ProtagonistA's lips 
 ProtagonistA was so thirsty , so hungry 
 It was a tragic accident that happened while ProtagonistA was working at the local sawmill 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 Thankfully , ProtagonistA's family was there for ProtagonistA 
 They helped ProtagonistA through the tough times and encouraged ProtagonistA to keep going 
 ProtagonistA 's even managed to find love again 
Some days ago I was sitting down at the kitchen table at Mary 's to finish a little bill for the woodworking shop , when I began to recall a good while back my father , who was a good - looking , well - to - do farmer who had in the last few years become a very wealthy man not only of ProtagonistA's own land but of ProtagonistA's own money , and who had been very careful , as a matter of course , to keep up with all the latest inventions and discoveries made in the field of agriculture , and who had , as a good - natured example , added to the wealth of ProtagonistA's country an immense amount , and whom I have never forgotten ProtagonistA's great credit to maintain because ProtagonistA had carried on the work of ProtagonistA's father at the same time of doing it , though not without much expense , and had yet enabled ProtagonistA to do much more than ProtagonistA had done before 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA was not going to let ProtagonistB ruin ProtagonistA's cake 
 It was ProtagonistA's passion 
 But lately , something had been off 
 ProtagonistA's cakes were still delicious , but they were n't quite the same 
 They were missing that special something that made them ProtagonistA's cakes 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear ProtagonistB come up behind ProtagonistA 
 What are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked , ProtagonistB's voice dripping with disdain 
 You idiot !  ProtagonistB shouted 
 ProtagonistA was done with ProtagonistB 
 You're lucky ProtagonistB do n't have a wand , because ProtagonistB would hex ProtagonistA into oblivion ,  ProtagonistB spat 
 ProtagonistB turned and stormed out of the kitchen , leaving ProtagonistA standing there , victorious 
There was once a year when the grapevines were ripe and they were ready to sing 
 It was so miraculous that they all thought ProtagonistA had done it many times over 
 ProtagonistA had been caught this time , and ProtagonistA knew it was only a matter of time before ProtagonistA was sent to prison 
It was around eleven o'clock and it had been almost two months since ProtagonistB had died — three , in fact , if you include the time ProtagonistA 'd spent in temporary hospital and the time of great pain and suffering ProtagonistA 'd been through 
 Hello , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said , smiling 
  ProtagonistC hope ProtagonistA do n't mind ProtagonistC coming by , but ProtagonistC wanted to check on ProtagonistA and see how ProtagonistA 're doing 
 It was so nice to have someone to talk to who understood what ProtagonistA was going through 
 ProtagonistC stayed for a cup of tea , and when ProtagonistC left , ProtagonistA felt just a little bit better 
 It was around eleven o'clock , and though it had been a tough few months , ProtagonistA was slowly starting to heal 
 ProtagonistB was a million miles away , but ProtagonistB was the one who showed ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could be anything ProtagonistA wanted to be 
 And that meant working the night shift 
 They agreed , and ProtagonistA was able to go back and save ProtagonistA from a fate worse than death 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 The creature was crying and ProtagonistA felt sorry for it 
 The creature , who ProtagonistA learned was called a Reckoner , ended up staying with ProtagonistA and became like a member of the family 
ProtagonistA's youth was spent following in ProtagonistA's brother 's footsteps 
 This made ProtagonistA happy and content in ProtagonistA's youth , but as ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to yearn for something more 
 It was n't until ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA finally found the courage to forge ProtagonistA's own path 
 But this was different 
 This was something ProtagonistA could n't just push through 
 This was cancer 
 But cancer was different 
 It was an enemy ProtagonistA could n't see , could n't touch 
 It was an enemy that was slowly killing ProtagonistA from the inside out 
 cancer was going to kill ProtagonistA 
 It was hard for everyone , but it was what ProtagonistA wanted 
 And that 's exactly what ProtagonistA got 
 ProtagonistA had been gone for weeks on a business trip and was now ready to relax 
 ProtagonistB , however , was not as pleased to see ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been dealing with the children and the household on ProtagonistB's own and was not in the mood to entertain ProtagonistA 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB had had enough 
 ProtagonistB stood up and told ProtagonistA to leave 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
 ProtagonistA had never been treated like this before 
 The family did their best to keep ProtagonistA comfortable and safe , but eventually they realized that it was time for ProtagonistA to move into the servant 's quarters 
There was once ProtagonistA , for ProtagonistA always had the same unkind name , and ProtagonistA never liked to be called that 
ProtagonistA's name is Harry Potter , insisted ProtagonistA , shrugging ProtagonistA's shoulders and turning ProtagonistA's attention to the board in ProtagonistA's hands , busy thinking about what ProtagonistA was going to do with ProtagonistA's life 
 Suddenly , an idea came to ProtagonistA 
 It was a crazy idea , but it just might work 
ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA often 
 ProtagonistB's reason for living 
 And so it was with ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA's soft skin , ProtagonistA's gentle touch , and ProtagonistA's beautiful smile 
 ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA's smell , ProtagonistA's taste , and the way ProtagonistA made ProtagonistB feel 
 ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA's laugh , ProtagonistA's voice , and the way ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA's love , ProtagonistA's passion , and the way ProtagonistA made ProtagonistB feel alive 
It is to the great credit of ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA is now living 
 ProtagonistA's parents had died when ProtagonistA was young , and ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistA's grandparents 
 When they died , ProtagonistA was left alone in the world 
 ProtagonistB was a kind man who took ProtagonistA in and gave ProtagonistA a job 
 It was clear that ProtagonistB was lost and did n't know where ProtagonistB was going 
There was once an old farmer in Oxfordshire , now dead and gone , who had lived long enough to see the day when playthings had their proper uses — when industry , rather than mere wit , was the proper measure of man 's worth ; when the frivolous avocations of childish boys , once well nigh spent , had in their turn given place to the occupations which distinguished the most respectable members of society ; when the good sense of the courts of law had been fairly given due regard , so that many of those cases in which society had once regarded as frivolous or trivial — and this was for the most part , indeed , the case , in which the good sense of the law had not in any way sufficed , but which were , or at any rate were , fairly decided by an inexperienced judge , who was , or rather was , permitted to decide them , according to the rules of the game — such were the days of ProtagonistA , when , as ProtagonistA was often apt to say , it was a game of chance , ye good folk   ( ProtagonistA was well aware that what ProtagonistA was about to say was absolutely true)—and it was a game of chance , as well as a game of chance ; for , when ProtagonistB is in possession of a fortune , it is very seldom that ProtagonistB finds ProtagonistB in possession of nothing but ProtagonistB's own mind and the power of ProtagonistB's imagination ; but as a matter of fact , it is most often the case that ProtagonistB finds ProtagonistB in possession of a fortune , not only owing to circumstances of fortune , but owing to the power of ProtagonistB's imagination 
 But I was persistent 
 I wanted to know what was going on 
 I wanted to know why ProtagonistA was acting so strange 
 Please , ProtagonistA ,  I begged 
  Just tell me what 's going on 
 I 'm ProtagonistA's friend 
 I care about ProtagonistA 
 But you have to promise not to tell anyone 
 I promised 
 ProtagonistA 's been seeing a therapist 
 ProtagonistA 's been struggling with ProtagonistA's mental health for a while now and ProtagonistA finally decided to seek help 
 I'm so proud of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  I said 
  It 's just been really tough 
 But ProtagonistA 'm getting better 
 ProtagonistA 'm slowly but surely getting better 
 I hugged ProtagonistA 
 I was so happy that ProtagonistA was finally getting the help ProtagonistA needed 
 And I was glad that ProtagonistA felt comfortable enough to tell me 
 It just goes to show that you never really know what someone is going through 
Hush , ProtagonistB , said the gleam in ProtagonistA's eyes as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB run barefoot through the streets of London 
 It was a cold night , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be cold and hungry by the time ProtagonistA got back to their squat 
 But ProtagonistB was new to the streets , and ProtagonistA had taken ProtagonistB under ProtagonistA's wing 
 ProtagonistB might not be able to take care of ProtagonistB yet , but ProtagonistB was a survivor 
I have stayed on at ProtagonistA's Hotel since the Titanic disappeared ; and if there was ever any doubt as to the character of ProtagonistA , it proved in every respect that ProtagonistA was as much a gentleman as a gentleman could be 
The young men of the time of King Arthur stared at ProtagonistA , to see if ProtagonistA were really what they had supposed ProtagonistA to be 
 The young men were not sure what to make of ProtagonistA 
 They had heard stories of a great warrior who had come from the north to help King Arthur in his fight against the Saxons 
 ProtagonistA was said to be a mighty warrior , with the strength of ten men 
 The young men had never seen anything like ProtagonistA before 
 The young men were impressed by ProtagonistA's words 
 They believed that ProtagonistA could help them defeat the Saxons 
 They cheered and welcomed ProtagonistA into their ranks 
 ProtagonistA's mother would scold ProtagonistA and tell ProtagonistA to come inside , but ProtagonistA never listened 
 ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA's car in the driveway and thought ProtagonistA might want some company ,  ProtagonistB said with a smile 
 It was always on display in the trophy room at Hogwarts , and ProtagonistA would often sneak in to take a look at it 
 They laughed and said that it was a nice dream , but that it was never going to happen 
There are many people who do not know it , but who know it very well , who say that men are born with ProtagonistA to 
 It is a very old saying , and one that is often repeated 
 It is said that ProtagonistA had thought ProtagonistA dead more times than ProtagonistA cared to remember 
 ProtagonistA was a lucky man , some would say 
 They had served together in the war and had been through everything together 
 But , one day , ProtagonistB was killed in action 
 But , the memories of war always haunted ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistC tried to help ProtagonistA , but there was nothing ProtagonistC could do 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA's memories became too much for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's own life 
 It is said that ProtagonistA's last words were  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistB 
 It was a mountain that had always loomed in the distance , but it seemed impossible to scale 
 ProtagonistA was amazed that ProtagonistA was actually doing it ! As ProtagonistA reached the top , ProtagonistA was filled with a sense of accomplishment 
 Death was no longer a mountain that loomed in the distance , but a conquered peak 
 The horse was stuck and could n't get out 
 The horse died in the ravine 
ProtagonistB had been best friends with ProtagonistA since they were in diapers 
 They had grown up together and now they were both in their early twenties 
 Now , it seemed like ProtagonistA was in over ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistB decided it was ProtagonistB's duty to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB went to talk to ProtagonistA's friends and tried to get them to convince ProtagonistA to get out of whatever ProtagonistA was involved in 
 But they were n't listening 
 ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB had to take matters into ProtagonistB's own hands 
 ProtagonistB went to talk to ProtagonistA and begged ProtagonistA to stop whatever ProtagonistA was doing 
 ProtagonistB had done ProtagonistB's duty as a friend and ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistA would be okay now 
 It was called  The Book of Knowledge  , and it looked very old and dusty 
 The book was full of information on all sorts of topics , and ProtagonistA quickly realized that this was a very special book 
 The book had made ProtagonistA into a very knowledgeable person , and ProtagonistA was very grateful to have found it 
 They were a powerful group of evil wizards who terrorized the kingdom 
 ProtagonistA charged into the castle , swords drawn 
 The Council was waiting for ProtagonistA , but they were no match for ProtagonistA's skills 
 Now that the Black Council was gone , the kingdom was finally at peace 
 ProtagonistA was hailed as a hero and lived happily ever after 
 It was a beautiful day outside , and ProtagonistA wanted to enjoy it 
A guest of honour called upon ProtagonistA and asked ProtagonistA to write a letter to ProtagonistB 
 It was a dark and stormy night , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA should n't go in 
 But the house called to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could n't resist its pull 
 There was no answer 
 Still no answer 
 But nothing did 
 The house was dark and musty , and it felt like it had n't been lived in for years 
 It was pitch black , and ProtagonistA could n't see anything 
 The premise of the show was simple enough 
 ProtagonistA and the other contestants would be dropped into a large maze , and they would have to find their way out 
 The first person to find the exit would win a cash prize 
 The day of the show arrived , and ProtagonistA put on ProtagonistA's glasses and entered the maze 
 ProtagonistA immediately got turned around , and it soon became clear that the maze was much more complicated than ProtagonistA had anticipated 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard someone yell ,  I found the exit!Bob turned around and saw one of the other contestants running towards the exit 
 That was the only way ProtagonistA knew how to go out 
 It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining 
 ProtagonistB had died a few years ago , and ProtagonistA had taken over the farm 
 The farm was in good shape , but it was a lot of work for one person 
 ProtagonistC was eating some hay , and ProtagonistC looked up at ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA lay down on the bed , fingers crossed in ProtagonistA's hands , and thought about the day ProtagonistA would die 
 It was a day ProtagonistA had been thinking about for a long time 
  ProtagonistA ,  the voice said ,  I know what ProtagonistA did 
 And I 'm going to make ProtagonistA pay 
  ProtagonistA's heart sank 
 ProtagonistA was used to getting looks of admiration from others , but ProtagonistB's look was different 
 It was as if ProtagonistB was looking at ProtagonistA with the same level of wonder and admiration that ProtagonistA felt when ProtagonistA looked at the world around ProtagonistA 
 It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever seen the light of day 
  Legends speak of a time when angels walked among men 
 It is said that when ProtagonistC was brought up in a house of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB came down from heaven to plead with ProtagonistA 
 It is said that ProtagonistB prevailed by ProtagonistB's grace and power upon the truth of ProtagonistB's pleadings 
 For of all the saints of the Gentiles , the most holy , and the most blessed , ProtagonistC was Frank 
 And yet , though raised unto heaven and set up as a star of justice , yet ProtagonistC was esteemed in the sight of ProtagonistA , not by ProtagonistC's own merit , but for the work that ProtagonistC had done 
 Neither was ProtagonistC despised in the sight of ProtagonistA : but ProtagonistC was exalted above all things , and was received with the most great privileges , even of ProtagonistA 
 And it came to pass , that ProtagonistC was esteemed a star , by one of the angels of ProtagonistA ; but before ProtagonistC was even named , ProtagonistC was already a star , and could alone be distinguished from all others 
 But now , it seemed , ProtagonistA was destined for a different fate 
ProtagonistA had been accused of a most capital offense and was sentenced to be hanged 
ProtagonistB had been waiting for ProtagonistA at the house , but when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA walking along the road , ProtagonistB decided to drive ProtagonistA home 
 It was a hot summer day and the sky was so blue that it almost looked like a painting 
 The mountains in the distance were also white , making the whole scene look like something out of a postcard 
 When they got home , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to go inside and get some rest 
 The bed groaned in protest but ProtagonistA paid it no mind 
 ProtagonistA was tired , so tired 
 It had been a long day and all ProtagonistA wanted to do was rest 
 ProtagonistA's eyes started to close and ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistA drifting off to sleep 
 Suddenly , the bed began to shake 
 ProtagonistA's eyes snapped open and ProtagonistA saw the bed frame rattling 
 ProtagonistA tried to get up but it was like the bed was holding ProtagonistA down 
 The shaking got worse and ProtagonistA could hear things crashing to the floor 
 The whole room was shaking now and ProtagonistA was terrified 
 The bed was crushing ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistA's ribs start to break 
 The pain was unbearable and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to die 
 The last thing ProtagonistA saw was the ceiling collapsing on top of ProtagonistA before everything went black 
 ProtagonistA was born into a poor family and ProtagonistA's parents were always fighting 
 As a child , ProtagonistA was constantly getting beaten by ProtagonistA's father 
 The gang was involved in all sorts of illegal activities , and ProtagonistA quickly learned how to fight and how to use a gun 
 One day , the gang was involved in a big shootout with a rival gang 
 ProtagonistA was shot multiple times and left for dead 
 But ProtagonistB was n't exactly what ProtagonistA had in mind 
 ProtagonistB was older than ProtagonistA , and not nearly as attractive as ProtagonistA would have liked 
 But ProtagonistB was wealthy , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could use ProtagonistB's money to ProtagonistA's advantage 
 And when ProtagonistB found out , ProtagonistB was furious 
 ProtagonistB demanded that ProtagonistA marry ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had no choice 
 And ProtagonistB 
 It was all so clear to ProtagonistA now , and ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could tell ProtagonistA's family how much ProtagonistA loved them 
 But it was too late for that now 
 ProtagonistA was retired and living in a small town in Florida 
 When ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was impressed by ProtagonistB's knowledge and ability to communicate with people 
 ProtagonistA was also impressed by the way ProtagonistB was able to help people who were in need 
 The old teacher had been kind to ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB was a boy , and had given ProtagonistB a book that had helped ProtagonistB to understand ProtagonistA's illness 
 The sun was setting and the sky was turning a beautiful orange color 
 When ProtagonistA was older and decided to take up the profession again , ProtagonistA was met with some resistance 
 Some people thought that ProtagonistA was too old and that ProtagonistA should just stick to mathematics , which ProtagonistA was also very good at 
 However , ProtagonistA was determined to prove them wrong and took up ProtagonistA's old profession of medicine once again 
 ProtagonistA's soul leaves ProtagonistA's body and enters the afterlife where ProtagonistA is met by ProtagonistA's deceased grandparents 
 They tell ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA has died and that ProtagonistA must now move on to the next life 
 Suddenly , a light appeared in the distance 
 It grew closer and closer until ProtagonistA could see that it was a door 
 ProtagonistA thought of all the things ProtagonistA should have said , all the things ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could have said , but now it was too late 
ProtagonistB never taught ProtagonistA to be a real man 
 ProtagonistB always told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was too soft , that ProtagonistA needed to be tougher if ProtagonistA wanted to make it in the world 
 ProtagonistB was a successful man , but ProtagonistB was also a cold and distant man 
 ProtagonistB never really showed ProtagonistA any affection , and ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was trying to live up to ProtagonistB's expectations 
 ProtagonistB died when ProtagonistA was still young , but ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA with a lot of money 
 ProtagonistB never taught ProtagonistA to be a real man , but in the end , ProtagonistA became a better man than ProtagonistB ever could have been 
 ProtagonistA's clothes were always wrinkled and ProtagonistA's hair was a mess 
 ProtagonistA's friends and family were amazed at the transformation 
 They started to ask ProtagonistA for advice on how they could change their own lives 
There was ProtagonistA there , but I do n't know if I liked ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA did n't care whether I did or did n't like ProtagonistA 
 I do n't think I ever really got to know ProtagonistA , but I do n't think I ever really wanted to either 
 Every time ProtagonistA turned around , ProtagonistB was there , haunting ProtagonistA and making ProtagonistA's life a living hell 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistB was there , standing in front of ProtagonistA , looking as menacing as ever 
 ProtagonistA continued reading , louder and more forcefully , and with each word , ProtagonistB grew weaker and weaker until finally , ProtagonistB disappeared altogether 
 ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA's stories and would always beg for more 
 ProtagonistB's eyes lit up and ProtagonistB begged ProtagonistA to make one of ProtagonistA's stories come true 
 ProtagonistB was so excited that ProtagonistB could hardly contain ProtagonistB 
 That night , ProtagonistB went to bed early , eager to see what would happen in the morning 
 The next day , when ProtagonistB woke up , ProtagonistB raced to find ProtagonistA 
 In ProtagonistA's place was a note that said  Do n't worry , ProtagonistA's story is coming true 
 The boy did n't know what to think , but ProtagonistB was excited to see what would happen next 
 ProtagonistB waited all day , but nothing happened 
 ProtagonistB began to worry that maybe ProtagonistA's story was n't coming true after all 
 Just as ProtagonistB was about to give up hope , ProtagonistB heard a knock at the door 
 ProtagonistB opened it to find Bob , dressed in a spacesuit and holding a pinky index finger up to ProtagonistB 
  And now ProtagonistA 'm taking ProtagonistB on the adventure of a lifetime 
 ProtagonistB could n't believe it as ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB by the hand and led ProtagonistB out into the night 
 Soon they were blasting off into space , exploring the stars and having the time of their lives 
 ProtagonistB knew that as long as ProtagonistB had ProtagonistA by ProtagonistB's side , anything was possible 
 George J
 Heard stood in the door of ProtagonistB's house , had formed a considerable material interest 
 ProtagonistB had been a hard - working man all ProtagonistB's life , and ProtagonistB was not going to let ProtagonistA have all the fun 
 ProtagonistA's boss was shocked , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA was done with this life 
 The full might of the Third Reich is at ProtagonistA's command , and I know I am going to die 
 I have seen the future , and it is full of death and destruction 
 I have seen the end of the world , and it is coming sooner than we think 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA began ,  but ProtagonistA do n't think this is going to work out 
  There was an awkward silence as ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA , processed what ProtagonistA had just said 
 They went their separate ways and ProtagonistA never looked back 
 The table was set with a beautiful cake and presents , and the guests were all arriving 
 ProtagonistB was so surprised and happy to see all of ProtagonistB's friends and family there to celebrate with ProtagonistB 
 Nobody knows how long ProtagonistA was dead , but ProtagonistA had been dead for quite some time 
 ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the afterlife 
 So , when ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistA could actually die and come back to life , ProtagonistA was intrigued 
 ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA's body and floated up into the sky 
 ProtagonistB then began to travel through the afterlife 
 ProtagonistB saw all sorts of things , and ProtagonistB met all sorts of people 
 ProtagonistB even met God 
 After what seemed like an eternity , ProtagonistB finally returned to ProtagonistA's body 
 We sat down on a bench and talked for a while about life and love and all of the things that ProtagonistA had seen in ProtagonistA's long life 
 There was no turning back now 
 As the day went on , ProtagonistA's energy started to flag 
 ProtagonistA was tempted to take a nap , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to keep going 
 It had been a long day , but ProtagonistA had accomplished what ProtagonistA set out to do 
 There were other people there , people ProtagonistA had known in life , and they were all happy to see ProtagonistA 
 It was nice to know that there was more to life than just what ProtagonistA had experienced in ProtagonistA's earthly life 
A whirlwind of joy washed over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistB took the first step of the day 
 They had planned to go fishing , and ProtagonistA was looking forward to spending some time with ProtagonistB and bonding over their shared love of fishing 
 As they made their way to the lake , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA stories of the times ProtagonistB had gone fishing with ProtagonistB's own father 
 ProtagonistA was so caught up in the moment that ProtagonistA did n't even realize they had arrived at the lake 
 ProtagonistB was soon by ProtagonistA's side , and they spent the next few hours chatting and fishing 
 ProtagonistA was said to have a flying horse that was full of jewels and had a fine head of hair 
 When ProtagonistA put the horse to practical use , it turned out to be an astute guide 
It was a warm summer 's day in 1994 that ProtagonistA stopped by the front of the morgue to ask if ProtagonistA should look into the morgue 
 The attendant told ProtagonistA that there was nothing to see , but ProtagonistA insisted 
 ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by death , and ProtagonistA wanted to see what was inside 
 The attendant relented , and ProtagonistA walked into the cool , dark room 
 Some were old , some were young , but all of them were dead 
 ProtagonistA was shaken by what ProtagonistA had seen , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget the experience 
 ProtagonistA tried to scream but it was too late , the thing had already snapped ProtagonistA's neck 
 ProtagonistA's friends ran away in terror , leaving Bobs body behind 
There was ProtagonistA 
 They talked for hours , until it was time for ProtagonistB to go 
 ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's number , and they parted ways 
 The doctors said there was nothing they could do 
 The cancer was too far gone 
 ProtagonistB was devastated 
 ProtagonistB had always been close to ProtagonistA , even though they did n't always see eye to eye 
 Now ProtagonistB was going to lose ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB decided to make the most of the time ProtagonistB had left 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA out to all ProtagonistA's favorite places 
 They went fishing , out to eat , and just spent time together 
 It was hard to see ProtagonistA declining day by day , but ProtagonistB was grateful for the time they had 
 ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB would cherish those memories forever 
 The paper was old and worn , but the words were still legible 
 ProtagonistA read the paper carefully , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
 This was it ; the moment that ProtagonistA had been working towards for so long 
 They will know ProtagonistA's fury 
 They would regret the day they ever crossed ProtagonistA 
 The colors were brighter , the people were more interesting , and the possibilities were endless 
 ProtagonistB had been a groundskeeper at the Yard for years , and ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA under ProtagonistB's wing 
 One day , ProtagonistB was injured while working on the grounds and had to be taken to the hospital 
 When ProtagonistB recovered , ProtagonistB was grateful to ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help and offered to teach ProtagonistA everything ProtagonistB knew 
 It was a warm day in May and ProtagonistA had just finished ProtagonistA's last day of school 
 But ProtagonistB had other plans 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA to do something for ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA to go down to the city and deliver this package to Mr
 Johnson 
 No , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA to do this 
 It 's very important 
 Johnson 's address and knocked on the door 
 ProtagonistC answered and ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistC was very old and very frail 
 Is ProtagonistC Mr
 ProtagonistC nodded 
 ProtagonistC took the package and then invited ProtagonistA in 
 ProtagonistC offered ProtagonistA a seat and ProtagonistA sat down , feeling very uncomfortable 
 So , tell ProtagonistC about ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistC said 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistC about ProtagonistB and how ProtagonistB was a cold , hard - working , lonely widow 
 ProtagonistC listened intently and then ProtagonistC started to talk about ProtagonistC's own life 
 ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistD and how ProtagonistC had never been able to get over ProtagonistD's death 
 ProtagonistC was very grateful to ProtagonistA for listening to ProtagonistC and ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was a good son 
 ProtagonistC said that ProtagonistC was sure that ProtagonistB was very proud of ProtagonistA 
 But all that changed when ProtagonistA heard that the fleet of the ministry of war was approaching Norfolk 
 Southampton was a busy place , and ProtagonistA knew that the fleet would bring with it many soldiers and supplies 
 ProtagonistA's village would be safe from the war , but ProtagonistA could not help but feel a sense of excitement at the thought of all the activity that was about to come to ProtagonistA's town 
 The house was full of servants ProtagonistA was constantly watched 
 ProtagonistA was not allowed to leave the property and was not even allowed to go into the town 
 ProtagonistB was so grateful that ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a big hug 
 It was easy to get into the house , except that it was in the middle of a wide country 
 The country was important for its manufactures , and ProtagonistA's occupation in those days was a delicate one 
 ProtagonistB was a young man , and ProtagonistB was very impressed with ProtagonistA's garden 
 ProtagonistB had never seen anything like it before 
 ProtagonistB was very interested and asked a lot of questions 
 There was a large object in ProtagonistA's yard , and it looked like it was moving 
 The snake was coiled up in a tree , and it was hissing 
 ProtagonistA was shaken up by the incident , but ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA was safe 
 The priest said ,  No , ProtagonistA is not the Son of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA went to the mountaintop and prayed ,  ProtagonistC , are ProtagonistC the Son of ProtagonistB ?  A voice came from the clouds and said ,  Yes , ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC am the Son of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's family was devastated 
 They could not believe that ProtagonistA was gone 
 It was going to be a great day 
 The store was empty except for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB put ProtagonistB's book down and looked at ProtagonistA 
  That will be a lot of money ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Are ProtagonistA sure ProtagonistA can afford it?Bob nodded 
  ProtagonistA 'm sure 
 ProtagonistB smiled 
  ProtagonistB 'm glad to see someone so passionate about reading ,  ProtagonistB said 
  This trunk of books is ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was the most beautiful girl ProtagonistA had ever seen , and ProtagonistB seemed to like ProtagonistA too 
 They started dating , and ProtagonistA was finally happy 
Bob was one of those who , during the last days of his life , and was never heard of again , fled into the great jungles of the interior of North America , and there perished under the gloomy and deadly care of a race of cannibals , said Dr
 Ketch , in a long catalogue of the frightful transactions of the last years of his life 
There was once ProtagonistA , and yet so light that even the weight of a small dog was sufficient to lift ProtagonistA 
 First , ProtagonistA's parents had died in a car accident 
 Then , ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle had died in a house fire 
 ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's teacher 
 ProtagonistB had been trying to help ProtagonistA as much as ProtagonistB could , but ProtagonistB could tell that ProtagonistA was struggling 
 One day , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA had gone to see if ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle had any clothes left 
 It 's a pity , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  It 's a pity ProtagonistA did n't go and see if ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle had any clothes left 
 Then , ProtagonistA's boss chewed ProtagonistA out for being late 
 And to top it all off , ProtagonistA's car got a flat tire on the way home 
 ProtagonistB was always meowing and scratching at ProtagonistA's door , trying to get inside 
Guilt began to creep over ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA was twelve 
 It was the guilt of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's friends wanted to see what would happen if they put the bird in ProtagonistA's backpack 
 ProtagonistA swam over to it and saw that it was a huge octopus ! The octopus was so big that it could easily have eaten ProtagonistA for lunch 
 The octopus seemed to be as curious about ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA was about it 
 It wrapped its tentacles around ProtagonistA and started to explore ProtagonistA's body 
 After ProtagonistB's death , ProtagonistA's father tried to fill the void by working even harder , but it was never the same 
 The dog was big and fluffy and looked friendly 
 The dog came over to ProtagonistA and sniffed ProtagonistA 
 Then the dog licked ProtagonistA's hand 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 But ProtagonistA's diary lived on , and it continues to help people who are going through tough times 
There is ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA is laughing 
 The wide , deep sheets that covered the vast north and south coasts , the black , under - sea channels that ran behind and in front of the archipelago , the glen which jutted out into the horizon to give a vast , rounded and sheltered edifice , and from which the narrow , narrow passages into the bowels of the ship , lined with luxuriant heather , sheltered the crew ; and the skies above all , where the blue - grey stars shone in their true blue glory , and the red stars which now flapped and twinkled in the night , of the moon and the stars , were all dreams to ProtagonistA 
In the year 1659 , the year of the reign of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was struck down at Munich by a single assassin , who afterwards killed ProtagonistA 
 The motive for the murder is not known , but it is speculated that the assassin was paid by one of ProtagonistA's many enemies 
 This tragic event caused great upheaval in England , and the assassin was never caught 
I was walking home from the store when I saw ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was always telling stories and I always enjoyed listening to ProtagonistA 
 I was fascinated by ProtagonistA's story and I could see the excitement in ProtagonistA's eyes 
 I could tell that ProtagonistA loved telling the truth and ProtagonistA was very proud of ProtagonistA's accomplishments 
 I did n't suspect that ProtagonistA was any other age than ProtagonistA appeared to be 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life the way it was and ProtagonistA did not want anything to interfere with that 
 The machine was ProtagonistA's life 's work , and ProtagonistA had poured everything ProtagonistA had into it 
 The storm changed course and veered away from the city 
 It looked abandoned , but ProtagonistA knew this was ProtagonistA's destination 
ProtagonistA's life had been much the same since ProtagonistA had first stood on a sleeping bag and walked through the night 
 It 's well ,  said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA strode purposefully into the room 
  ProtagonistA 'm glad to see you 're all here 
 There were gasps and cries of surprise from the gathered crowd , but ProtagonistA just held up ProtagonistA's hand to quiet them 
  It 's a shock to all of us 
 But ProtagonistA 'm getting too old for this business , and it 's time to hang up ProtagonistA's hat 
  But all things must come to an end 
 Thank you all for everything 
  Why would ProtagonistA want ProtagonistA to do that ?  ProtagonistB was horrified 
 ProtagonistB had no idea what could have possessed ProtagonistA's friend to ask ProtagonistA to do such a thing 
  ProtagonistA is a good boy ,  ProtagonistB said 
  There must be some mistake 
 '  ProtagonistB was at a loss 
 ProtagonistB did n't know what to do 
 Should ProtagonistB go to the police ? But what if ProtagonistA was just mistaken ? ProtagonistB did n't want to get ProtagonistA in trouble if ProtagonistA was n't really guilty of anything 
 In the end , ProtagonistB decided to just talk to ProtagonistA ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB went to ProtagonistA's house and knocked on the door 
 ProtagonistB answered 
  Is ProtagonistA home ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 But ProtagonistB 'm not sure ProtagonistA wants to talk to ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Why not ?  ProtagonistB asked 
  ProtagonistA 's been acting strange lately 
 ProtagonistA 's been saying some really strange things 
  ProtagonistB was starting to get worried 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's time and went home 
 ProtagonistB had to talk to ProtagonistA and find out what was going on 
On the night when the corpse of Bob was found , ProtagonistA , died , a very unhappy death , which was neither premeditated nor foreseen 
 It was a great shock to all who knew ProtagonistA , for ProtagonistA had always been a kind and gentle lady , loved by all who knew ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's death was a great tragedy , and it was made all the more tragic by the fact that ProtagonistA's only son , Lord Herveyth , was the one who murdered ProtagonistA 
The last things ProtagonistA heard said ProtagonistA was going to die 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to believe it , but the more ProtagonistA thought about it , the more it made sense 
 It was only a matter of time before ProtagonistA's body gave out 
On the afternoon of February 21st , 1780 , I was travelling with ProtagonistA , through the streets and alleys of London , when ProtagonistA suddenly stopped in front of a room in the Campus of Trinity College 
 I was curious as to what had caught ProtagonistA's attention and went to take a look 
 The headline read :  American Revolution : King George III Declares War on the Colonies  
 ProtagonistA was engrossed in the article , and I could n't help but feel a sense of dread at the thought of another war 
ProtagonistB was always the picture of calm and serenity 
 It was one of the things ProtagonistA loved about ProtagonistB 
 In the midst of a chaotic world , ProtagonistB was always able to find peace 
 ProtagonistB was quieter than usual and seemed to be lost in thought 
 After a moment 's hesitation , ProtagonistB confided in ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was worried about a family member who was ill 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB began to feel better 
 The sun was just peeking over the horizon as ProtagonistA left the dock and headed out to sea 
There is something about ProtagonistA that makes ProtagonistA's body speak to us 
 It 's as if ProtagonistA's very presence fills the room and commands our attention 
 When ProtagonistA speaks , we ca n't help but listen 
 We are lucky to know ProtagonistA , and we are better people for having ProtagonistA in our lives 
I find it difficult to believe ProtagonistB ever did anything so bizarre as make ProtagonistA believe that ProtagonistA was immortal 
 It seems so out of character for ProtagonistB 
 I can remember when I was younger , ProtagonistB would always tell me that ProtagonistB needed to be careful with ProtagonistB's words because they could never be taken back 
 So , for ProtagonistB to tell ProtagonistA something like that , it must have been for a good reason 
 I can only imagine that ProtagonistB was trying to teach ProtagonistA a lesson about life 
 ProtagonistA's ' insane accident ' had been a long , hard day , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel stir crazy 
 The nurses and doctors were nice , but ProtagonistA was ready to go home 
 Finally , ProtagonistA's doctor came in and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could go home 
 The thought of the wolf eating the poor little pig made ProtagonistA feel sick to ProtagonistA's stomach 
ProtagonistA's life had been a series of dark rooms 
 ProtagonistB was very sorry to see that ProtagonistA's work was not what ProtagonistB had hoped for , and ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA could recommend any other artists whose work ProtagonistB might like 
 ProtagonistA was disgusted by the way humanity could pollute and destroy such a beautiful thing , but ProtagonistA was also mesmerized by its power and beauty 
ProtagonistA had been put out of ProtagonistA's misery , but ProtagonistA had not been without a struggle for days 
 It all started when ProtagonistA lost ProtagonistA's job 
 ProtagonistA had been reduced to begging for money just to buy food 
 A kind - hearted woman took pity on ProtagonistA and gave ProtagonistA a few dollars 
 ProtagonistA was able to get off the streets , get a nice place to live , and start fresh 
 However , ProtagonistA's good fortune did n't last long 
 A kind - hearted woman took pity on ProtagonistA and gave ProtagonistA a few dollars 
 ProtagonistA was able to get off the streets , get a nice place to live , and start fresh 
 However , ProtagonistA's good fortune did n't last long 
 A kind - hearted woman took pity on ProtagonistA and gave ProtagonistA a few dollars 
 ProtagonistA was able to get off the streets , get a nice place to live , and start fresh 
 However , ProtagonistA's good fortune did n't last long 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had no other choice but to end it all 
 Fortunately , the pills were only over - the - counter medication and not something more serious 
 It all depends on the day , and on the people around ProtagonistA 
 But then , on the way out , ProtagonistB stopped ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's face was marked and ProtagonistA did n't have the faintest idea of how to make it look serious 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB did n't think ProtagonistA was ready for the job and that ProtagonistA should try again in a few years 
 ProtagonistA was crushed 
In the year of God , or , rather , of the Year during which ProtagonistA lived , or perhaps was there , about the end of the last century , ProtagonistA , began to be concerned about the state of ProtagonistA's house , and lost all patience with those who prostituted it 
 The walls were cracked , the windows were broken , and the roof was caving in 
 ProtagonistA was horrified 
 The other members of the Board were equally horrified , and they immediately set about trying to find a way to raise the necessary funds to restore the house to its former glory 
 ProtagonistA was determined to see ProtagonistA's house restored to its former glory , and ProtagonistA was willing to do whatever it took to make that happen 
 It took a number of years , but eventually , the house was restored to its original condition 
You ca n't win ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA 's still got a lot of weight on ProtagonistA's bones 
 But that does n't mean ProtagonistA ca n't be a winner 
 ProtagonistA 's been working hard to lose weight , and ProtagonistA 's down to ProtagonistA's last few pounds 
 ProtagonistA 's been following the diet and exercise plan to the letter , and ProtagonistA 's feeling good 
 The day of the contest arrives , and ProtagonistA is ready 
 ProtagonistA 's put in the work , and now it 's time to see if it pays off 
 ProtagonistA 's lost the weight , and ProtagonistA 's feeling great 
 ProtagonistA 's done it ! 
 This led ProtagonistA to start a website called Truth-ism
 This page contained the same content as the original site , but with a new title 
 ProtagonistA's passion for seeking the truth was evident in everything ProtagonistA did 
 Even in death , ProtagonistA was still dedicated to sharing ProtagonistA's findings with the world 
 ProtagonistA's website continues to be a source of information for truth seekers everywhere 
It was about twelve years ago , in the year of the twelfth moon , that ProtagonistA , after sitting on ProtagonistA's throne as though ProtagonistA had been sitting for days , died 
 The people of the kingdom were in mourning for ProtagonistA , and a new king had to be chosen 
 The council of elders met to discuss who would be the new king , and they decided on ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was a good man , and they thought ProtagonistB would be a good king 
 ProtagonistB was crowned the new king , and ProtagonistB ruled the kingdom well 
 ProtagonistB was a just and fair king , and the people loved ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB ruled for many years , and then he too died 
 Once again , the people were in mourning , and a new king had to be chosen 
 This time , the council of elders chose ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was a good king , but ProtagonistC was not as loved as ProtagonistB had been 
 ProtagonistC was a fair and just king , but the people did n't seem to connect with ProtagonistC the way they had with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC ruled for a few years , and then ProtagonistC too died 
 Once again , the people were in mourning , and a new king had to be chosen 
 This time , the council of elders chose ProtagonistD 
 ProtagonistD was a good king , but ProtagonistD was not as loved as ProtagonistD's father or grandfather had been 
 ProtagonistD was a fair and just king , but the people did n't seem to connect with ProtagonistD the way they had with ProtagonistB or ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistD ruled for a few years , and then he too died 
 And so it went , for twelve years , the cycle repeating itself over and over 
 The people of the kingdom were in mourning for ProtagonistA , and a new king had to be chosen 
 And each time , the new king was not as loved as the last 
 ProtagonistA saw things differently than other people and ProtagonistA always spoke ProtagonistA's mind , no matter how unpopular ProtagonistA's opinions were 
 This made ProtagonistA a lot of enemies over the years , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 But then , one day , something happened that changed everything 
 It was like ProtagonistA was living in a nightmare 
 The only thing that kept ProtagonistA going was the hope that one day ProtagonistA would wake up from this nightmare and everything would go back to normal 
 But that day never came 
In the year of our Lord , ProtagonistA was expelled from the University of Stirling , because ProtagonistA had attempted to overthrow a treaty of peace made between the university and the Royal Society , which was published in the Royal Society 's organ for the time , and was dated the previous October , 1783 
 However , ProtagonistA's world came crashing down when ProtagonistA was expelled from the university 
 ProtagonistA was devastated , and did n't know what to do with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was tempted to give up on ProtagonistA's dreams , and just become a regular person 
 But something inside ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA to keep fighting , and to never give up on ProtagonistA's dreams 
 The New Royal Society quickly gained a following , and ProtagonistA became a well - known figure in the scientific community 
 ProtagonistA's work was finally recognized by the University of Stirling , and ProtagonistA was given an honorary degree 
One morning , however , the fantastic form of ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA had any idea what a plot was 
 Now , do ProtagonistA have any idea what the desired end of ProtagonistB's plot might be ?   ProtagonistA 'm afraid not , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 'm just a simple farmer , and ProtagonistA do n't know much about such things 
   Well , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB 'll tell ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB plan to take over the world !   The world !  said ProtagonistA 
  That 's a mighty big ambition , ProtagonistB 
 But why do ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA ?   ProtagonistB do n't need ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB ,  but ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA might like to help ProtagonistB 
 After all , it would be a great adventure , and ProtagonistA would be richly rewarded 
   ProtagonistA do n't know , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA 
  It sounds like a lot of trouble 
   Trouble !  said ProtagonistB 
  What do ProtagonistA mean , trouble ? There 's no trouble at all 
 It 's all been planned out 
 Everything is under control 
 There 's nothing to it but to do it !   ProtagonistA do n't know , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA 
  It all sounds very complicated to ProtagonistA 
   Complicated !  said ProtagonistB 
  It 's not complicated at all 
 It 's quite simple , really 
   ProtagonistA do n't know , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 'm just a simple farmer , and ProtagonistA do n't know anything about taking over the world 
   That 's all right , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB 'll teach ProtagonistA everything ProtagonistA need to know 
 Just have faith in ProtagonistB 
   All right , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA 
 You 're not going to believe it ,  said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA opened the stack of papers on the table 
 ProtagonistB was impressed with what ProtagonistA had put together , and ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA the go - ahead 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled , and ProtagonistA could n't wait to get started on ProtagonistA's project 
 It was finally happening , and ProtagonistA was going to make it a success 
 ProtagonistA's men were able to find a pod and bring it to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was able to get away just in time 
Several hours before ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA had written to ProtagonistA's sister:I'm sorry ProtagonistA have n't been in touch more often 
 ProtagonistA know we 've grown apart over the years , but ProtagonistA still love ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistB can find it in ProtagonistB's heart to forgive ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB read the letter after ProtagonistA had passed away 
 ProtagonistB was surprised and touched by ProtagonistA's words 
 Even though they had n't been close , ProtagonistB still loved ProtagonistA and was glad ProtagonistA had reached out to ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's final moments 
 The doctors had told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was lucky to be alive , but ProtagonistA did n't feel so lucky 
 ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's job , ProtagonistA's wife had left ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's children never wanted to see ProtagonistA 
 All because of that stupid scar 
The huge globe had been a source of great fascination for ProtagonistA ever since ProtagonistA was a young boy 
 ProtagonistA's father had told ProtagonistA that it was a gift from the gods and that it was meant to protect the city from harm 
 It was a symbol of ProtagonistA's father 's greatness and a reminder of the family 's legacy 
ProtagonistB always said , if you put ProtagonistA on the moon , ProtagonistA would go crazy 
 ProtagonistB was always warning me about the dangers of space travel , but I never listened 
 I was determined to be the first person to walk on the moon , and nothing was going to stop me 
 We started making preparations right away 
 It took a lot of work , but we finally managed to get ProtagonistA to the moon 
 We rushed back into the spaceship to find ProtagonistA ranting and raving like a madman 
 ProtagonistA's eyes were wild and ProtagonistA's hair was standing on end 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA had gone crazy 
 ProtagonistB was right - space travel is dangerous 
 The bird had a beak like a black - crowned gull , and a silver piece of lead 
 The judge looked at ProtagonistA and shook his head 
  I 'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but I 'm going to have to sentence ProtagonistA to two weeks in jail 
 I hope ProtagonistA can turn ProtagonistA's life around 
 ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as Sarah , and said that ProtagonistB was a friend of ProtagonistA's son 
 ProtagonistA's son had told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was a bit of a recluse and never left the house , so ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistB would come and visit ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was pleased to have a visitor and they spent the next few hours chatting and getting to know each other 
The three men were sitting on the front steps of ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA rolled slowly through the long , winding streets of Mexico City 
 They were all smoking cigars and drinking whiskey , and they were all feeling very pleased with themselves 
 They had just pulled off a heist at the local bank , and they were now on their way to a safe house to count their loot 
 As they rolled along , they began to notice that they were being followed by a black SUV 
 They tried to lose it , but it stayed with them 
 Eventually , they realized that they were being boxed in by the SUV and another car 
 They were about to be ambushed 
 They began firing at their attackers , and they soon had them on the run 
 The three men cheered and high - fived each other 
 They had just made a clean getaway 
 ProtagonistA had been fascinated by the town ever since ProtagonistA had first heard of it 
 The streets were busy with people going about their business 
 ProtagonistA was struck by how friendly everyone was 
 They were always willing to stop and chat , and they seemed to be genuinely interested in ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's story 
 ProtagonistA was also fascinated by the way the town had managed to retain its old - world charm despite the modern world moving on around it 
 It was a small , one - story house with a single room 
 The room was divided into two sections : the living room and the kitchen 
 There was a small bathroom off to the side 
 The Champion House was located in the middle of a small town in the middle of nowhere 
 The town was so small that it did n't even have a name 
 ProtagonistB was a very special dog because ProtagonistB could talk 
 ProtagonistC was so powerful that ProtagonistC could make anything ProtagonistC wanted come true 
 ProtagonistB was very interested in ProtagonistC and asked ProtagonistA to take ProtagonistB to meet ProtagonistC 
 After a long journey , they finally arrived at ProtagonistC's castle 
 ProtagonistC was very pleased to meet them and agreed to grant ProtagonistB one wish 
 ProtagonistB thought for a moment and then said ,  ProtagonistB wish ProtagonistB could talk like ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistC granted ProtagonistB's wish and ProtagonistB was able to talk like ProtagonistA from then on 
 The three of them talked long into the night about all sorts of things 
 ProtagonistB was very happy to have found such a good friend in ProtagonistC 
 At the bottom of the abyss was a small , bright light 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , then took a deep breath and jumped 
 ProtagonistB had a grave look on ProtagonistB's face and ProtagonistA knew that something was wrong 
 It 's ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistB replied 
  ProtagonistC 's given the order to kill ProtagonistD 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
 I know ,  ProtagonistB replied 
  But what can we do ? We 're just two people 
  If we can get to ProtagonistD before ProtagonistC's men do , we can save ProtagonistD's life 
 ProtagonistB nodded 
 It was risky , but it was the only chance they had 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB set out into the night , making their way to ProtagonistD's residence 
 They were careful to avoid any of ProtagonistC's men , and they made it to ProtagonistD's house without incident 
 Thank ProtagonistA for warning ProtagonistD ,  ProtagonistD said 
  ProtagonistD will be sure to leave the city immediately 
 But before they could take more than a few steps , they were surrounded by ProtagonistC's men 
 I'm sorry , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But it looks like we 're too late 
 The men grabbed ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's mother and dragged them back to ProtagonistC's headquarters 
 ProtagonistA's hand trembled as ProtagonistA pulled the knife from ProtagonistA's pocket 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and ran towards ProtagonistB , knife raised 
 ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA coming and laughed 
 ProtagonistB pulled out ProtagonistB's own knife and ran towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB stabbed ProtagonistA in the stomach and ProtagonistA fell to the ground , gasping for breath 
 The last thing ProtagonistA saw before ProtagonistA died was ProtagonistB's face , laughing at ProtagonistA 
 One day , a stranger came to the village and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was destined for great things 
 The stranger said that ProtagonistA had a special gift that would change the world 
 The stranger told ProtagonistA about a lost city that was hidden in the mountains 
 The city was full of treasure and ProtagonistA was the only one who could find it 
 ProtagonistA's discovery changed the village and everyone was happy 
I am the earliest member of the family whose great- grandfather was a man named Charles Charles George George William II , who came to America in 1755 , and established in New York a church , so called because it was given by ProtagonistA by ProtagonistA's immediate family , and , in which ProtagonistA was pastor , that ProtagonistA may have been authorized in the church , by the bishop , to baptize believers , in behalf of others in need ; and it appears from the genealogical roll of the church , that ProtagonistB was named Jane , or Jane Simpson , and ProtagonistB entered into he with great solemnity , and without any hesitation ; and ProtagonistB married Jane , who was second wife to a distinguished cousin , a gentleman of good position , named Charles Charles , of Wapping , who was afterwards lord of the borough of Harlem ; and although ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB to be an innocent wife , yet ProtagonistB tried to prevent ProtagonistB from marrying , either because ProtagonistB was under fifteen years of age , or else because ProtagonistB was already of marriageable age ; because without Frank 's knowledge , and without ProtagonistB's grandmother 's consultation , ProtagonistB had died , without a word from ProtagonistB , of an accidental overdose of opium , which ProtagonistB had been prescribed for ProtagonistB's ill health 
Bob , says that although ProtagonistA was born in the year 1646 , ProtagonistA has never heard of a time when ProtagonistA had not heard of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB is one Mr
 John Smith , who was born in the year 1632 
 ProtagonistA's family had been taking turns sitting with ProtagonistA , but today , they had all gone to work and left ProtagonistA alone 
 So when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's house unlocked , ProtagonistA was panicked 
 But when ProtagonistA got there , everything was fine 
 Nothing was missing and there was no sign of forced entry 
After ProtagonistA was married to ProtagonistB the toys were gone and when ProtagonistA woke up ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a tiny room colored a bright crimson against a pale blue sky 
 ProtagonistA was confused at first , but then ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was in a dream 
 They were both happy to see ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was finally free from ProtagonistA's nightmare 
 It felt like ProtagonistA's life was stuck in a rut 
 ProtagonistB had already destroyed the world 
 It was the voice of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was laughing at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was laughing at ProtagonistA for being a hero 
ProtagonistA was born in the beginning , and ProtagonistA was called Adam 
 Together , they created a family and a life 
 They were happy and content 
ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the Lost City 
 It was a place that was spoken about in hushed tones , as if it were a sacred place 
 This time , ProtagonistA was determined to find it 
 It was as if ProtagonistA had finally found ProtagonistA's true home 
 ProtagonistA 's made a fine report and the colonel is pleased 
 The colonel decides to retire ProtagonistA from the cavalry 
 ProtagonistA thanks the colonel for ProtagonistA's years of service and rides off into the sunset 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 They were always together , and everyone could see how happy they were 
 One day , ProtagonistB was diagnosed with a rare and incurable disease 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB passed away 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 It was like ProtagonistB was still with ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistA mean , look at all this stuff 
 It 's just a bunch of useless paper 
 People used to come to the library to read and learn 
 Now , they just came to browse the internet or play on the computers 
 I do n't know , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB think there 's still a lot of good in the world 
 People just need to be reminded of it sometimes 
 Maybe ProtagonistB was right 
 Maybe the world was n't as bad as ProtagonistA thought 
 Maybe there was still some good left in it 
 ProtagonistA was smitten 
 ProtagonistB accepted , and ProtagonistA was thrilled 
 ProtagonistB was impressed , and they had a great time together 
 The rabbit stopped and looked at ProtagonistA 
 They just stared at each other for a moment before the rabbit hopped away 
 ProtagonistB , had been planning your death for months 
 ProtagonistB had hired assassins and mercenaries to do the job , but they had all failed 
 Finally , ProtagonistB decided to do it ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB cast a powerful spell that would kill you instantly 
 The smooth , sweet liquid slid down ProtagonistA's throat , warming ProtagonistA from the inside out 
 ProtagonistB's eyes were filled with desire and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would n't be able to resist ProtagonistB much longer 
 ProtagonistB welcomed ProtagonistA into ProtagonistB's arms , and they spent the rest of the night exploring each other 's bodies 
 There was a delivery man standing there with a package for ProtagonistA 
 Shorter , would have known ProtagonistA was on a deserted island , whistling at the day 's quiet 
 In 1590 , ProtagonistA was appointed by the parliament to the office of lieutenant - general in the service of the king and commanded in the service of the kingdom 
This is the story of what happens when ProtagonistA , thinks ProtagonistA knows everything 
 ProtagonistB fires ProtagonistA on the spot 
 ProtagonistA is stunned 
 But ProtagonistB is a cruel mistress , and ProtagonistB decided to take ProtagonistA away from this world far too soon 
 It was a tragic accident , and ProtagonistA did n't even see it coming 
 It was a senseless act that took away ProtagonistA from this world , and everyone who knew ProtagonistA was devastated 
There was ProtagonistA 
 So when the Duchess of Marlborough died and ProtagonistA was given the succession of the Spanish dominions , ProtagonistA was thrilled 
 ProtagonistB was a great ruler and ProtagonistB was confident that under ProtagonistB's guidance , ProtagonistA would be able to build a powerful empire 
 ProtagonistA's dream was finally becoming a reality 
 And eventually , ProtagonistA's dream came true 
 There was ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB looked suspicious 
 They arrested ProtagonistB and took ProtagonistB away , and ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief 
 It was the ninth day of the new year , and ProtagonistA had just saved ProtagonistA's town from a potential disaster 
 It was a comfortable chair , and it had been in the family for generations 
 ProtagonistB had been a big man , and the chair had been made to accommodate ProtagonistB 
 The chair had seen a lot of history , and it had been witness to a lot of important events 
 It had been in the room when ProtagonistA's great - grandfather had been born , and it had been in the room when ProtagonistA's great - grandmother had passed away 
 It had been there for all of the happy times and all of the sad times 
 And now , it was there for ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA studied for ProtagonistA's exams 
Once in a very long while ProtagonistA will make a fool of ProtagonistA , and because ProtagonistA was an idiot ProtagonistA got ProtagonistA into a lot of trouble 
 It was a device that you could attach to your shoes that would make you run faster 
 ProtagonistA's friends had told ProtagonistA that it sounded too good to be true , but ProtagonistA was convinced 
 ProtagonistA's friends were right , the device was too good to be true 
 It was a disease that killed thousands of people every year , and it was spreading like wildfire 
 The Winter Sickness was a mystery , and ProtagonistA was getting closer and closer to giving up 
 It was a small clue , but it was enough to give ProtagonistA hope 
 The news was that the stock market was crashing and that there was going to be a recession 
 ProtagonistB had never seen a man so well put together 
 ProtagonistB felt like ProtagonistB was the only woman in the world 
  ProtagonistA 'm the captain of this ship 
 ProtagonistB felt like ProtagonistB was going to faint 
 ProtagonistB had never been this close to a man before 
 ProtagonistB felt like ProtagonistB could feel the power emanating from ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB felt safe and protected 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB could trust ProtagonistA 
 I'm Sarah ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm the first mate 
 ProtagonistB did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistB was completely overwhelmed 
 ProtagonistB was shocked 
 ProtagonistB had never expected this 
 But ProtagonistB realized that ProtagonistB felt the same way 
 ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB would do anything for ProtagonistA 
 Yes , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB will be ProtagonistA's wife 
 ProtagonistB had always been a bit of a recluse , and ProtagonistB had always warned ProtagonistA not to go near the old house 
 But , curiosity got the best of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA sneaking around the property 
 It was as if someone was watching ProtagonistA 
 The house was musty and dark , and it felt like something was stalking ProtagonistA 
 It was as if something was holding ProtagonistA there 
 ProtagonistA was trapped 
ProtagonistA had been brought before the Council many times before , but this time ProtagonistA was in for a special treat 
 The Council was a group of powerful people who ruled the city with an iron fist 
 This time , they had brought ProtagonistA in for a public execution 
ProtagonistA was born an orphan in and of ProtagonistA's father 's house on the river Seine ; the son of Dave 
 ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistA's father 's friends , and ProtagonistA learned to fend for ProtagonistA at an early age 
 They had a happy life together , and they had two children 
It was ProtagonistA's idea to buy a servant 's room and make an apartment for ProtagonistA 
 The servant 's room was now a cozy little apartment that was perfect for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA always felt out of place in ProtagonistA's small town , like ProtagonistA was meant for something more 
 ProtagonistA's dream was to move to the city and become a model 
 ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA's town and saw ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was impressed by ProtagonistA's looks and offered ProtagonistA a contract on the spot 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled and packed ProtagonistA's bags for the city 
 The constant partying and superficial conversations were taking their toll 
That night ProtagonistA was in a state of profound confusion , for ProtagonistA had seen a vision , and ProtagonistA had been cast into the midst of a great and terrible mystery 
 ProtagonistB's name was Sarah , and ProtagonistB was the one who would save them all 
 They chatted easily as they strolled along , and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA telling ProtagonistB all about ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistB listened intently , and when ProtagonistA had finished , ProtagonistB simply said ,  It sounds like ProtagonistA 're looking for something 
 ProtagonistB smiled knowingly and said ,  ProtagonistB think ProtagonistB can help ProtagonistA find what ProtagonistA 're looking for 
 Come with ProtagonistB 
 And ProtagonistB was right 
 ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA to a small park that was tucked away in a quiet corner of the city 
 They sat down on a bench , and ProtagonistB said ,  Close ProtagonistA's eyes and imagine the life ProtagonistA want to live 
 Visualize it as vividly as ProtagonistA can 
 ProtagonistA was surrounded by family and friends , and ProtagonistA felt happier than ProtagonistA had ever felt before 
 When ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes , ProtagonistB was gone , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget the moment that ProtagonistA had found what ProtagonistA had been searching for all ProtagonistA's life 
When ProtagonistA leaves ProtagonistA's home ProtagonistA has but one thing to lose : ProtagonistA's virginity 
 ProtagonistA 's heard so much about sex and ProtagonistA 's ready to finally experience it for ProtagonistA 
 They go back to ProtagonistB's place and things start to get hot and heavy 
 ProtagonistA panics and tells ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA has to go back and get it 
 ProtagonistB 's obviously disappointed , but ProtagonistA is relieved 
 It was filled with treasures and ProtagonistA was very happy 
ProtagonistA's father had been diagnosed with Alzheimer 's a few years ago and since then , their relationship had changed 
 ProtagonistB was different from any woman ProtagonistA had ever met 
 ProtagonistB was kind and gentle and ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA feel things ProtagonistA had never felt before 
 ProtagonistA had been warned that it would be a lot of work and that ProtagonistA would be sleep - deprived , but ProtagonistA was not prepared for the sheer exhaustion that came along with it 
 The first few weeks were a blur of feedings and changing diapers and trying to get the hang of this whole parenting thing 
It is a terrible , terrible idea , even if entirely accidental , to talk to one of the Ancient Ones 
 The voice was deep and booming and full of an ancient wisdom that ProtagonistA could not understand 
 The Ancient Ones are not to be trifled with 
 They are powerful and dangerous and should be left alone 
This is a story about a man who must be kept from knowing , because it would kill ProtagonistA , that ProtagonistC , could be alive and always be looking for ProtagonistA 
 But one day , ProtagonistB was killed in a robbery gone wrong 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 The police could never find ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was alive and well 
 And ProtagonistC was always looking for ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistC found ProtagonistA 
 And ProtagonistC would have killed ProtagonistA too , if ProtagonistA had n't been prepared 
 It was a cold winter day when ProtagonistB passed away 
 ProtagonistB was a cruel woman , who never showed ProtagonistA any kindness 
 Even on ProtagonistB's deathbed , ProtagonistB refused to see ProtagonistA 
 But on this day , something was different 
 The waves were higher than ProtagonistA 'd ever seen them , and the wind was howling 
 They had a quota to fill , and ProtagonistA was the captain 
 The waves were crashing over the boat , and ProtagonistA was starting to get worried 
 The boat was hit by a wave and capsized 
 ProtagonistA was thrown into the water and separated from ProtagonistA's crew 
 ProtagonistA was pulled underwater by the current and started to panic 
 ProtagonistA was shaken up by the ordeal , but ProtagonistA was grateful to be alive 
 You can see it in the way ProtagonistA's boss is looking at ProtagonistA , and in the way ProtagonistA's boss is standing 
 ProtagonistB had a kind face and ProtagonistA felt drawn to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was not alone and that ProtagonistC was real 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA just needed to have faith and keep praying 
 ProtagonistA was always surrounded by adoring fans and was constantly in the spotlight 
 The sun was setting and the sky was turning a beautiful shade of pink and purple 
 So far , it was going well 
It was Christmas time in the year of our Lord 1662 and ProtagonistA was sitting down at the first coffee - table conversation of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had been invited by ProtagonistB , to join ProtagonistB and some others for a cup of coffee and some light conversation 
 ProtagonistA's job was boring and ProtagonistA's life was unfulfilling 
 ProtagonistA loved being outdoors and spending time with the dogs 
 They brought ProtagonistA joy and happiness 
It was a quiet April afternoon , and perfectly to the good taste of the artist , who wanted to make a work out of his own life , that ProtagonistA passed through the doors of the Gallery of the Imperial Palace , and took up ProtagonistA's residence in a double - room with a balcony , and ProtagonistA's father took ProtagonistA in hand 
 The first days were the hardest , as ProtagonistA had to get used to the new surroundings and the people 
 The artist , who was a very good - natured man , gave ProtagonistA some lessons in painting , and ProtagonistA , took to it like a duck to water 
The sun rose slowly , but in the midst of all the misery of the city , which was then , and for a long time afterwards , a fine and flourishing town , there rose a little meek , innocent - looking girl of about sixteen or seventeen years of age , who seemed to have been driven into a very inconvenient position during the war ; and for the most part it was the fault of ProtagonistA's parents , who were not at all happy , poor , or otherwise about ProtagonistA , in the least 
 ProtagonistB's name was Betty , and ProtagonistB had been living with ProtagonistC in the city ever since ProtagonistB could remember ; but ProtagonistB's parents had died when ProtagonistB was quite young , and ProtagonistB knew nothing about them 
 ProtagonistC was a good woman , but ProtagonistC was very poor , and could not do much for ProtagonistB 
 The war had made things worse , and now they were both living in a little attic room , which was all they could afford 
 ProtagonistB was a quiet , gentle creature , who never complained , and always tried to make the best of things ; but ProtagonistB was very lonely , and often longed for someone to love ProtagonistB and care for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB had never had any friends , as ProtagonistB was too shy to make any ; and the only person who had ever shown ProtagonistB any kindness was ProtagonistA 
 One day , when ProtagonistB was sitting alone in ProtagonistB's room , ProtagonistB heard a loud noise downstairs , and then a crash 
 ProtagonistB ran to the window , and saw ProtagonistA in the street below , with a broken window behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB's heart sank , as ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA would be in trouble again ; but ProtagonistB was not prepared for what happened next 
 ProtagonistA was arrested and taken to prison , and ProtagonistB never saw ProtagonistA again 
 ProtagonistB heard that ProtagonistA had been sentenced to death , and ProtagonistB could not believe it 
 ProtagonistB was sure that there must be some mistake , and that ProtagonistA would be set free ; but the days went by , and there was no news 
 At last , the day came when ProtagonistB was to see ProtagonistA again ; but it was not the happy meeting that ProtagonistB had dreamed of 
 ProtagonistA was brought out to be executed , and ProtagonistB was there to witness it 
 ProtagonistB was heartbroken , and could not understand why such a cruel fate had befallen ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistB watched ProtagonistA die , ProtagonistB could not help wondering if there might not have been some other way ; but ProtagonistB knew that it was too late now , and ProtagonistA was gone forever 
 ProtagonistB had been upon ProtagonistA's account at the same time as the marriage 
 ProtagonistB said that it would help take ProtagonistB's mind off of the fact that their parents were no longer alive 
 It was getting late , and the innkeeper told them that they needed to leave 
 ProtagonistB was very drunk by this point , and ProtagonistB stumbled as they walked out 
 ProtagonistA's husband managed to catch ProtagonistB and helped ProtagonistB into the car 
 They drove home , and ProtagonistB fell asleep in the backseat 
 ProtagonistA's husband looked over at ProtagonistA and asked if ProtagonistA was going to be okay 
 The next morning , ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistB had left a note saying that ProtagonistB was sorry , but ProtagonistB could n't stay there any longer 
 ProtagonistA's husband tried to comfort ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA just could n't shake the feeling that ProtagonistB had left because of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB entered , looking around with a confused expression 
 When ProtagonistB's eyes met ProtagonistA's , ProtagonistB let out a small gasp and took a step back 
 I'm sorry ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB thought this was ProtagonistB's compartment 
 The woman hesitated for a moment before sitting down across from ProtagonistA 
 I'm Lily ,  ProtagonistB said , shaking ProtagonistA's hand 
 They made small talk for a while , talking about where they were going and what they did for a living 
 Eventually , they ended up in a passionate embrace and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had found something special 
There was once ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had a hundred sheep and had no fewer than three horses 
 One day , ProtagonistA's sheep got out of their pen and started to run around the farm 
 ProtagonistA's only son , Bob , had died in a car accident two years ago 
 This left ProtagonistA with only ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA's grandchildren , whom ProtagonistA loved dearly 
 It was a time for ProtagonistA to catch up with ProtagonistA's family and enjoy a good meal 
 But this Sunday was different 
 ProtagonistB was very quiet and would not meet ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was leaving ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had met someone else and was moving away 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 But ProtagonistB was determined to go 
 ProtagonistB packed ProtagonistB's bags and left 
 ProtagonistA was left alone with ProtagonistA's memories 
 They were the only family ProtagonistA had left 
 ProtagonistA smiled and went inside , where ProtagonistA was greeted by ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's cat , Snuggles 
 When ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA a story about a time when ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's age and went on a hike with ProtagonistB's friends 
The ceremony of the wedding was as follows : Bob , was gifted with a celestial body -- the body of ProtagonistA -- in which all the ancestors of the English family of Syverson were to be seen , for ProtagonistA was the daughter of Alfred the Great , of the house of Sylvester 
 The wedding was held in the presence of all the English nobility , and the bride and bridegroom were both radiant with happiness 
There was ProtagonistA , but who was not sure that it was ProtagonistA's duty 
 Some said that ProtagonistA should do it , others said that ProtagonistA should n't 
There was once ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's age was sixteen 
 It was a beautiful sight , and one that ProtagonistA would never forget 
 ProtagonistA's hair was disheveled and ProtagonistA's eyes were red and swollen 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA had been crying 
 Suddenly , the door to the room opened and ProtagonistB walked in 
 ProtagonistB came over to ProtagonistA and knelt down beside ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA , what 's wrong ?  ProtagonistB asked gently 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 'm so sorry 
 ProtagonistB wrapped ProtagonistB's arms around ProtagonistA and held ProtagonistA close 
  It 's okay , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said soothingly 
  It 's not the end of the world 
 We 'll just have to help ProtagonistA study more for the next one 
 It was n't the end of the world 
 But it sure felt like it 
 ProtagonistA had been born into slavery , and ProtagonistA would die a slave 
ProtagonistA had said it was fine ; it was , as it were , the best thing that ever happened to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA felt that it had been the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been married for 20 years and had 2 kids 
 ProtagonistA's hair was thinning and ProtagonistA's waistline was expanding 
 The class was filled with people of all ages , but ProtagonistA felt most comfortable with the other middle - aged students 
 The other students were always impressed with ProtagonistA's creations 
 The baking class gave ProtagonistA a new sense of purpose and ProtagonistA was finally happy again 
 ProtagonistB was in the kitchen cooking dinner when the phone rang 
 After ProtagonistB hung up the phone , ProtagonistB came into the living room and sat down next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC had been in a car accident and ProtagonistC was gone 
ProtagonistA's uncle told ProtagonistA a story about a beetle that landed in a tall , dark , green tree 
 The beetle was very small , but it was able to climb to the top of the tree with ease 
 Once it reached the top , the beetle looked around and then began to descend back down the tree 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated by the beetle and its ability to climb the tree 
Less than an hour after the end of the year , ProtagonistA was found murdered in ProtagonistA's apartment , ProtagonistA's throat slit 
 The police were called and they began their investigation 
 They found that ProtagonistA had been having an affair with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was married and ProtagonistC had found out about the affair 
 ProtagonistC was the one who killed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been brought up by ProtagonistA's father and mother in a small village in the north of England , and had never been taught anything but to be a good - natured , happy - go - lucky girl 
 But ProtagonistA's father had died when ProtagonistA was ten years old , and ProtagonistB had married again , and ProtagonistA had been sent to live with ProtagonistA's stepfather in a large town 
 Here ProtagonistA had been put to work in a factory , and had soon become discontented and unhappy 
 The only thing that had kept ProtagonistA from leaving home and going out into the world to seek ProtagonistA's fortune was ProtagonistB's entreaties that ProtagonistA would not desert ProtagonistB 
 But at last ProtagonistA's stepfather had turned ProtagonistA out of doors , and ProtagonistA had been obliged to wander forth into the world to seek ProtagonistA's fortune 
When ProtagonistA was three years old , ProtagonistA was brought to bay in the arms of a British soldier 
 The soldier held ProtagonistA close and protectively as they made their way through the battle that was raging around them 
 Bullets flew past them , and explosions shook the ground , but the soldier never faltered 
 Finally , they made it to safety and ProtagonistA was reunited with ProtagonistA's family 
Now , what is it ? said ProtagonistC to the old woman who lay on ProtagonistA back in a critical state , trying to escape the vault with ProtagonistA's head down , as if ProtagonistA had suddenly realized what it was ProtagonistA had been planning 
 It 's the TARDIS ,  ProtagonistB gasped 
  ProtagonistB 've been trying to tell ProtagonistC 
 The TARDIS is in the vault 
 The Doctor 's eyes widened 
  The TARDIS ? But how?I do n't know ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But it 's there 
 ProtagonistB can feel it 
 The Doctor hesitated for a moment , then nodded 
  All right 
 ProtagonistC 'll go take a look 
 ProtagonistC turned to ProtagonistA 
  Can ProtagonistA carry ProtagonistA nodded , and ProtagonistC lifted ProtagonistB onto ProtagonistA's back 
 Be careful ,  ProtagonistB said 
  The TARDIS is 
 alive 
 The Doctor nodded again , then turned and ran back into the vault 
 They could hear ProtagonistC's voice echoing through the vault as ProtagonistC called out to the TARDIS
Suddenly , there was a blinding flash of light , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistB go limp in ProtagonistA's arms 
 ProtagonistC came running back out of the vault , a look of shock on ProtagonistC's face 
 I'm not sure ,  ProtagonistC said ,  but ProtagonistC think the TARDIS is gone 
  ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA sympathetically 
  ProtagonistB know , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 As a child , ProtagonistA would play any and every sport ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA 's one of the best in ProtagonistA's sport and ProtagonistA 's loved by fans all over the world 
 ProtagonistA 's made a name for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA 's living ProtagonistA's dream 
On a certain day in the year 1812 , during the drifting days of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's father , who had a small fortune of a few thousand pounds , suddenly died 
 ProtagonistA was left with nothing but a small inheritance 
 ProtagonistA was forced to find a job to support ProtagonistA 
 The letter said that ProtagonistA's father had left ProtagonistA a large sum of money 
ProtagonistB had known ProtagonistA since they were both in diapers 
 They had grown up together and been through everything together 
 When their parents died , it was ProtagonistA who stepped up and took care of ProtagonistB 
 Now , ProtagonistB was the one who was there for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB wanted to help ProtagonistA through this tough time , just like ProtagonistA had helped ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB wanted to be the one person ProtagonistA could rely on , just like ProtagonistA had been the one person ProtagonistB could always rely on 
 But then , one day , something happened that changed ProtagonistA forever 
 ProtagonistB , was crying 
 ProtagonistB was so sad and ProtagonistA felt terrible 
ProtagonistA was borne in the City of London , between eight and ten o'clock , on Tuesday , the twenty - first day of June , 1688 
 ProtagonistA was born to the Island of Dunk , in the Sound of the Sea , where ProtagonistA remained until the arrival of the King 's Majesty 
 The King 's Majesty was pleased with ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was given a place in the royal court 
The sun rose red in the sky , and ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's gleaming blue eyes bored into the dark depths of the ocean , a sight ProtagonistB had surely seen many times before 
 But to ProtagonistA , it was new and exciting , and ProtagonistA could n't help but stare 
 ProtagonistB , seeing ProtagonistA's fascination , came over and explained what ProtagonistB was looking at 
 The ocean , ProtagonistB said , was full of life , even down in the dark depths where the sun could n't reach 
 They were on their way to pick up ProtagonistA's sister from school 
 Suddenly , the coach came to a stop 
 ProtagonistB got out to see what was happening 
 ProtagonistC was trying to fix it , but ProtagonistC could n't 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistC if ProtagonistC could take them to the nearest house 
 ProtagonistC said ProtagonistC could and ProtagonistB got back in the coach with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistC took them to a big house 
 ProtagonistD came to the door and ProtagonistB asked if ProtagonistB could use ProtagonistB's phone 
 ProtagonistD said ProtagonistD could and ProtagonistB went inside with ProtagonistD 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistB came back out and said they were going to have to wait for a while for ProtagonistA's sister 
 Now , every time someone opens the jar , they can see all of ProtagonistA's memories and learn about ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA's heart sank as ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA's plane was under attack 
 Finally , after what felt like an eternity , the gunfire stopped 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a klutz , so it was no surprise when ProtagonistA stepped on the monkey 's foot 
 The monkey screeched in pain and ProtagonistA apologized profusely 
They had been waiting for ProtagonistA like that since the day ProtagonistA 'd turned seventeen 
 They were always waiting for ProtagonistA , even when ProtagonistA was right in front of them 
 They would have given anything to have ProtagonistA back , even for just one day 
 When ProtagonistA left , they were lost 
 They did n't know how to function without ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been gone for ten years , but it felt like a lifetime 
 They had all changed so much , but they were still the same people who had been waiting for ProtagonistA all those years ago 
 They all cheered and hugged ProtagonistA 
 They had finally gotten ProtagonistA back 
 Now , they could finally move on 
 ProtagonistB was a man who was in a relationship with a woman , and they had a child together 
 ProtagonistB was a man who was successful in ProtagonistB's career , and ProtagonistB was a man who was happy with ProtagonistB's life 
 ProtagonistA was blindfolded and ProtagonistA's hands were tied behind ProtagonistA's back 
 The van drove for what felt like hours before coming to a stop 
 ProtagonistA was pushed out of the van and onto the ground 
 It was a cold winter day and ProtagonistB had been lying in the snow for hours 
 ProtagonistB's skin was pale and ProtagonistB's eyes were glassy 
 The mouse ran over to the cheese and started eating it 
 ProtagonistA's hair stirred and ProtagonistA's face grew red and pouted 
 ProtagonistA's eyes flashed with fear and ProtagonistA put out a soft smile that had the air of a quarter 
 ProtagonistB was getting closer and ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was a woman 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a white dress and ProtagonistB's hair was blowing in the wind 
 ProtagonistB reached out ProtagonistB's hand and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA being pulled towards ProtagonistB 
 The last thing ProtagonistA saw was ProtagonistB's cold , dead eyes before ProtagonistA was pulled into the darkness 
 ProtagonistA 's got so much money that ProtagonistA sleeps in ProtagonistA's own bed every night , and ProtagonistA 's never had to worry about a thing in ProtagonistA's life 
 That 's how ProtagonistA 's become so successful 
 ProtagonistA 's shown that if you want something badly enough , you can make it happen 
 No matter what obstacles are in your way , you can overcome them if you set your mind to it 
It was nt any of ProtagonistB business , and could have easily gone either way , but when ProtagonistA was walking hand in hand with a dead man ProtagonistA felt a strong urge to help 
 It was a hot day and the sun was beating down mercilessly 
 ProtagonistB could see that ProtagonistA was in a bad way and ProtagonistB felt compelled to do something 
 ProtagonistB approached the pair and offered to help 
 ProtagonistB stayed with ProtagonistA until ProtagonistA felt better and then went on ProtagonistB's way 
 ProtagonistA's son , Bob , had been left in the care of the parsonage by his father and ProtagonistA was very grateful for that 
 Duryea , on the other hand , was not as close to ProtagonistC's brother as ProtagonistA was to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistC felt that ProtagonistB had always been a bit of a reckless adventurer and that ProtagonistB's death was not entirely unexpected 
 Nevertheless , ProtagonistC was still saddened by the loss and offered ProtagonistC's condolences to ProtagonistA 
 The two of them continued to sit in the parlor , talking about ProtagonistB and their shared memories of ProtagonistB 
 As they talked , they began to feel closer to each other and by the end of the conversation , they were both feeling much better 
ProtagonistA was lying upon the ground , ProtagonistA's arms stretched out in front of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's legs crossed , ProtagonistA's head resting on the side of ProtagonistA's hands 
ProtagonistA's friends called ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB would not cast a glance aside , for ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA ! They had been married for 5 years , and in that time , ProtagonistA had never once looked at another man 
 However , one day , ProtagonistA's friends convinced ProtagonistA to go to a gay bar with them 
 ProtagonistC was tall , muscular , and had the most beautiful blue eyes ProtagonistA had ever seen 
 ProtagonistC was also completely naked , save for a small pair of black shorts 
 ProtagonistA's friends called out to ProtagonistC 
 They stripped each other down and made love all night long 
We had just left ProtagonistA , when ProtagonistA , in a singular instance , which must have occurred to most of the passengers , jumped into the sea 
 I was on the deck at the time , and saw ProtagonistA go over 
 I at once ran to the side , and looked over 
 There was no one in sight 
 It was a cold day and the village was covered in snow 
 ProtagonistB was excited to see ProtagonistA and ran to ProtagonistA 
 They hugged each other and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA how much ProtagonistB had missed ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB had always been a strong man , but now ProtagonistB was getting old and frail 
 ProtagonistA's father had been searching for ProtagonistA for days , ever since ProtagonistA had gone missing 
 ProtagonistB did n't want ProtagonistA to die , so ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA on the shore with some food and water 
 & SONS , PAINTERS AND DECORATORS 
 What is it , ProtagonistA ?  asked ProtagonistB , when ProtagonistB had shut the door of the little office 
 I'm in trouble , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistC is very ill , and the doctor says ProtagonistC must have proper nursing 
 Friend thought for a moment 
 Then ProtagonistB said :  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'll tell ProtagonistA what ProtagonistB 'll do 
 ProtagonistB 'll give ProtagonistA a month 's holiday , with full pay 
 And when ProtagonistA come back , ProtagonistB 'll give ProtagonistA a rise of two shillings a week 
 That will help ProtagonistA to pay for the nursing 
 ProtagonistA's face brightened 
  That 's very good of ProtagonistB 
 And from that day ProtagonistA was a better workman than ever , for ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was a kind and considerate man 
ProtagonistA had been born , with all the tender feelings and memories which ProtagonistA could bear , ProtagonistA in the year of grace 1792 , to ProtagonistB the 15th of July , in the parish of St
 dernier - sur - Marne , in the town of Port Omega , in the district of the Madonnier family 
 ProtagonistA was loved by all who met ProtagonistA , and it was clear that ProtagonistA was destined for great things 
 In the year of grace 1792 , tragedy struck the Madonnier family 
 ProtagonistB , was killed in a hunting accident , leaving ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's mother , Marie , devastated 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB got angry with ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA to go to bed 
 But lately , ProtagonistA 'd been feeling like ProtagonistA was losing ProtagonistA's touch 
 The stories ProtagonistA was reading just did n't seem to capture the imagination of the children like they used to 
 The children were both asleep by the time ProtagonistA finished , and ProtagonistA felt a heavy weight settle on ProtagonistA's chest 
 ProtagonistA was relieved and happy to know that ProtagonistA could still be ProtagonistA , no matter what ProtagonistA's hair color was 
There was once ProtagonistA , and was of opinion that ProtagonistA had great moral and intellectual advantages , in comparison with ProtagonistA's neighbours , that ProtagonistA might best enjoy them , by treating them with the greatest civilities , and most affability 
 However , ProtagonistA's neighbours , who were of a different opinion , thought that the best way to enjoy their advantages was to treat ProtagonistA with the greatest civilities and affability 
 We have been waiting for ProtagonistA all day 
 We have been talking about all the things we are going to do together 
 We are going to have so much fun 
ProtagonistA was seated on the steps of the throne in the center of the court , ProtagonistA's face pale and ProtagonistA's eyes trembling as ProtagonistA looked down at the golden blade of Agredite in the hands of ProtagonistB 
 It was a moment ProtagonistA had been dreading for months , ever since ProtagonistA's father had announced ProtagonistA's engagement to ProtagonistB 
 The ceremony began , and ProtagonistA could do nothing but watch as ProtagonistB pledged ProtagonistB's life to ProtagonistA 
 When it was over , they were both escorted to their separate chambers 
 First , ProtagonistA got scolded by ProtagonistA's boss at work 
 And to top it all off , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB would not be able to help ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's financial problems 
 So when ProtagonistA stepped to the lectern , ProtagonistB did not interrupt ProtagonistA's position 
 ProtagonistB just stood there and listened 
 And when ProtagonistA was done , ProtagonistB applauded 
 ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the room that was always there , and out of the dark , dusty floors 
 The room was filled with all kinds of objects , from books to furniture to clothes 
 ProtagonistB was a beautiful , snake - like creature who did n't seem to understand emotions either 
 One day , they decided to go on an adventure 
 They went to a place where there were no humans and they could be themselves 
 They had a wonderful time , and when they returned back to the real world , they both felt more understood and accepted 
 I was drawn to ProtagonistA because I saw something in ProtagonistA that I related to 
 We became friends , and I soon found out that ProtagonistA was one of the most talented musicians I had ever met 
 I remember the first time I ever saw ProtagonistA play 
 The way ProtagonistA played the guitar and sang with such passion and emotion was unlike anything I had ever seen before 
 I was hooked from that moment on 
 We started dating soon after that , and I was the happiest I had ever been 
 I felt like I had finally found my soulmate 
 Unfortunately , ProtagonistA's demons eventually caught up with ProtagonistA 
 I tried to help ProtagonistA , but it was too late 
 I still think about ProtagonistA every day 
 I know ProtagonistA 's in a better place now , but I ca n't help but wonder what could have been if ProtagonistA had just stayed away from drugs 
ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the deep 
 It was a place where ProtagonistA's home was but a small nook of earth and air , and it was filled to the top with the fragrance of flowers and the fragrance of the wind 
 ProtagonistA was immediately met with the overwhelming smell of flowers and the sound of the wind rushing past ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was in awe of the beauty of the deep and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never want to leave 
 ProtagonistB was so old that ProtagonistB's skin was almost transparent , and ProtagonistB's eyes were milky white 
 ProtagonistB was sitting in a large chair , and ProtagonistB's hands were shaking 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had been alive for centuries , and that ProtagonistB had seen the rise and fall of many empires 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB was ready to die , and that ProtagonistB wanted ProtagonistA to kill ProtagonistB 
 As ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for ending ProtagonistB's life 
  ProtagonistB , on hearing this , was much astonished , and asked ProtagonistA what could induce ProtagonistB to think that this was the true religion , when there were so many others in the world 
 It was a cold , winter day and the snow was falling gently outside 
 ProtagonistA's family was very close and they had all been by to see ProtagonistA over the past few days 
 ProtagonistA's wife , children , and grandchildren all loved ProtagonistA very much 
 However , ProtagonistA's luck ran out one day when ProtagonistA was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer 
 ProtagonistA's wife was by ProtagonistA's side throughout ProtagonistA's battle , but sadly , ProtagonistA lost ProtagonistA's fight and passed away 
 While ProtagonistA's family was grieving , they took comfort in knowing that ProtagonistA had lived a happy and fulfilling life 
It was a beautiful good day in October when ProtagonistA trod into the garden and saw ProtagonistB 
 They had not seen each other since ProtagonistB had left home to marry ProtagonistB's husband , John 
 ProtagonistB was overjoyed to see ProtagonistA and they hugged each other tightly 
 They chatted for a while , catching up on all that had happened in the intervening years 
 It was a beautiful day in October and the sun shone down on the two siblings as they caught up on all that had happened in their lives 
 ProtagonistA had been sentenced to life in prison for a crime ProtagonistA did n't commit 
 Suddenly , the door to ProtagonistA's cell opened 
 ProtagonistB was beautiful and had a kind face 
 Hi , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB's name is ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB 'm here to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was confused 
 ProtagonistB know ProtagonistA 're innocent ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm going to help ProtagonistA get out of here 
 It was ProtagonistA's favorite thing to do 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , the sun was already up 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , the moon was already up 
In the year 1853 , ProtagonistC was born under the week of ProtagonistA's hair being put on ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistB found that ProtagonistA was interested in the matter , but ProtagonistB had never before encountered this in ProtagonistB's life and had no idea of the purpose of the conduct 
 ProtagonistB was deceived into believing that ProtagonistC's affairs were in proper hands 
The first time ProtagonistA raised the dead was in a remarkably unscientific way , by which ProtagonistA meant by the ' oldest work of art of all the earth ' 
 It was how ProtagonistA had coped with their loss 
 There was ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was desperate to speak to ProtagonistC one last time 
At the turn of the last century , when Europe was drifting apart , there lived ProtagonistA , and by the name of Caroline Caroline , or Caroline of Mary , ProtagonistA was called 
 ProtagonistA was born in England , in a small town near the Scottish border , and ProtagonistA grew up there , in a house by the sea 
 ProtagonistA's father was a fisherman , and ProtagonistB was a seamstress 
 When ProtagonistA was ten years old , ProtagonistA's father died in a fishing accident , and ProtagonistB had to take in sewing to make ends meet 
 They had two children , a boy and a girl 
 They would build sandcastles , and then they would run to the waves and jump in , just like ProtagonistA had done when ProtagonistA was a child 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistC died suddenly , and ProtagonistA was left alone with ProtagonistA's children 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be strong for ProtagonistA's children 
 They would build sandcastles , and then they would run to the waves and jump in , just like ProtagonistA had done when ProtagonistA was a child 
There was once ProtagonistA , and the only reason ProtagonistA had n't gone to college was that ProtagonistA did n't want to be thought of as dumb 
 But one day , ProtagonistA's boss asked ProtagonistA to fill in for ProtagonistB while ProtagonistB was out on vacation 
 When ProtagonistB came back , ProtagonistB was so impressed with ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB recommended ProtagonistA for a promotion 
 From then on , ProtagonistA was known as the smartest janitor in the school 
 ProtagonistA was immediately rushed into surgery 
 Thankfully , the tumor was benign and ProtagonistA made a full recovery 
There is no such thing as ProtagonistA , but there is a pricetag which is often a price - tag of the costume which ProtagonistA wears 
 When they 're together , they often take on different roles , and ProtagonistA is always the price - tagged one 
 It 's a running joke between them , and it 's something that they all enjoy 
 It was unlike anything ProtagonistA had ever seen before 
 Soon it was right above ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could see that it was a spaceship 
 A voice came from the ship , asking ProtagonistA to come aboard 
 The voice told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was the only one who could hear it and that ProtagonistA was chosen for a special mission 
 The voice told ProtagonistA that there was a planet in danger and that ProtagonistA was the only one who could save it 
 ProtagonistA was just a normal person , how could ProtagonistA save a planet ? The voice told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had the power to do anything ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to 
 ProtagonistA was given a suit to wear and told to go to the planet 
 There was a huge monster attacking it 
 ProtagonistA had saved a planet and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could do anything ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to 
 ProtagonistA was entranced by the words on the page , and the way they came to life in the light 
 What are ProtagonistA doing , ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistA's father asked , surprised to see ProtagonistA sitting in the dark 
 I'm reading , Dad 
 And the light has never been the same since 
The sun was up on this day ; the moon was bright and ProtagonistA sprang out of ProtagonistA's perch with a great voice 
 It was time to start the day and ProtagonistA had a lot to do 
 As ProtagonistA sang , the other birds began to stir 
 They stretched their wings and shook off the sleep 
 Soon , the whole flock was awake and ready to start the day 
 The sun was just peeking over the horizon and the world was new again 
 It was going to be a good day 
 It was a hot day and the sun was beating down on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was sweating and ProtagonistA's shirt was sticking to ProtagonistA's back 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB's husband had left ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB was all alone 
ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA were a family of only two children 
 They both fell sick with an acute hope of death 
 ProtagonistB was very apprehensive about ProtagonistB's impending death , but ProtagonistB was also very curious about ProtagonistA's work 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to tell ProtagonistB about it 
 ProtagonistB was very interested in what ProtagonistA had to say 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to tell ProtagonistB more about ProtagonistA's work 
 ProtagonistB was fascinated by ProtagonistA's work 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to tell ProtagonistB more about it , but ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA was saving it for the publication of ProtagonistA's work 
 ProtagonistB was disappointed , but ProtagonistB understood 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA's work was very important to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA sulks and sinks back into the bible , ProtagonistA's silver eyes fixed on a section regarding birds 
 ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by birds , ever since ProtagonistA was a little boy 
 But now , ProtagonistA's life was in shambles 
 ProtagonistA's wife had left ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's job was on the line , and ProtagonistA's children were estranged from ProtagonistA 
 The painting is of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB face half hidden in shadow 
 ProtagonistA 's never felt this way before 
 ProtagonistA 's been coming to this alcove every day for the past week , ever since ProtagonistA first saw the painting 
 ProtagonistA 's never been a particularly religious person , but ProtagonistA finds ProtagonistA praying to whatever god or goddess might be listening 
 ProtagonistA 's never felt this way before , and ProtagonistA ca n't ignore it 
 ProtagonistA 's never been one for taking risks , but this feels like the most important thing ProtagonistA 's ever done 
 ProtagonistA 's never been a particularly lucky person , but ProtagonistA hopes , this time , ProtagonistA's luck will change 
I see ProtagonistA's Rolls - Royce parked beside my school , said ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA's fancy - picture - tiles on the mantelpiece , and ProtagonistA's clapboard in the corner 
  ProtagonistB see that ProtagonistA has been very successful ,  ProtagonistB continued 
  Yes , ProtagonistB ,  I replied ,  but I do n't think ProtagonistA is very happy 
   Why do you say that ?   I do n't know 
ProtagonistA had been partially drowned when ProtagonistA climbed into the water of the ship , to which ProtagonistA had belonged for some years , and which had been ProtagonistA's home 
 This was a very important visit , and ProtagonistA wanted to make sure everything went well 
 When ProtagonistB finally arrived , ProtagonistA was relieved to see that ProtagonistB was just a normal person 
 They talked and laughed together , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had made a new friend 
 The visit went well , and ProtagonistA was very happy that ProtagonistA had been able to make such a good impression 
ProtagonistA's facial features , ProtagonistA's eye color , and ProtagonistA's body , said my father , are all different 
 ProtagonistA was born with a genetic condition that causes ProtagonistA's features to be different from everyone else 's 
 ProtagonistA's eyes are a different color from ProtagonistA's parents ' , and ProtagonistA's body is shorter and stockier than theirs 
The whirling cloak of ProtagonistA slipped from ProtagonistA's fingers and into the arms of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was a young man , barely out of ProtagonistB's teens , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA did n't stand a chance against ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB's grip on the cloak was slipping , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to do something 
 ProtagonistB lost ProtagonistB's balance and teetered on the edge of the cliff 
 ProtagonistB was shaken , but unharmed 
 ProtagonistB had everything ProtagonistB could possibly want , and ProtagonistA did n't want to just get ProtagonistB something that ProtagonistB would never use 
 When ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB looked surprised but happy 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that all ProtagonistB wanted was for ProtagonistA to spend more time with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB just wanted to spend more time together 
 ProtagonistA was relieved that ProtagonistA had finally figured it out 
 ProtagonistA was also touched that ProtagonistB just wanted ProtagonistA and not material things 
 When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA was met by ProtagonistA's attacker , who proceeded to rape ProtagonistA 
 I met a man who I fell in love with , and who loved me back 
 We got married , and we are happy 
 On the bush was a turnip , and on the turnip was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with a smile , and ProtagonistA smiled back 
 They both stood there for a moment , looking at each other 
 Then , without warning , ProtagonistB ran away 
 ProtagonistB then said ,  ProtagonistB know ProtagonistA 're looking for the lost city of Atlantis 
 ProtagonistB can help ProtagonistA find it 
  ProtagonistA was shocked 
 It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA felt alive and happy 
ProtagonistA had a habit of making a speech with all the amazing clarity , propriety , and rationalism of a genius , and almost the same effect , when ProtagonistA had finished , as when ProtagonistA had finished ; for ProtagonistA was always going on about something , ever since ProtagonistA had heard it described to ProtagonistA 
 This made ProtagonistA a very popular person at parties , as ProtagonistA could always be relied upon to entertain the guests with ProtagonistA's latest rant 
 However , ProtagonistA's wife was less than impressed with ProtagonistA's behavior and often told ProtagonistA to  just shut up already !  
 ProtagonistA 's never been one for commitment , but ProtagonistA 's always enjoyed the company of women 
 ProtagonistA 's finally found someone that ProtagonistA wants to spend the rest of ProtagonistA's life with and ProtagonistA 's never been happier 
They were sitting together on the leaden plank of the old boat , the aye , but not so long ago when the sailors were shivering in their hundreds , when the water was so deep that even the redskin boys were drowned in it ; when the sun was so low and the sky so black that the fires of the desert were almost out of breath , when the ship was so light that ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head in despair when ProtagonistA saw the captain in the middle of the night going beyond the windward deck , and instead of sinking , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA among the stars , drifting in space , with the power to move anything that ProtagonistA pleased in the universe 
 ProtagonistA 's been a stuntman for years , and has worked on some of the biggest films in Hollywood 
 But ProtagonistA 's never actually been to a movie theater to watch one of ProtagonistA's films 
 That all changes today , when ProtagonistA finally decides to go see one of ProtagonistA's movies on the big screen 
 The lights dim and the movie starts 
 ProtagonistA is blown away by what ProtagonistA 's seeing 
 ProtagonistA 's never seen ProtagonistA's work on the big screen before , and it looks amazing 
 It was a great experience , and ProtagonistA ca n't wait to do it again 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 Unfortunately , ProtagonistA's boat sank and ProtagonistA drowned 
 The apple , the bramble , the cherry - tree , the thorn - trees - they were all calling to ProtagonistA , urging ProtagonistA to come to them 
 They were the only things that mattered now 
 The forest was dark and foreboding , but ProtagonistA did n't hesitate 
 There in the clearing were the apple , the bramble , the cherry - tree , the thorn - trees , and so many trees , some two hundred yards in circumference 
 They were all alive and well , and they welcomed ProtagonistA with open arms 
In the beginning , there was a star 
 The same star which , in the beginning , ProtagonistA made 
 The shell of which ProtagonistA fashioned into four parts : the golden - headed , the blue - eyed , the bright - eyed , the yellow - eyed , and the red - eyed 
 All of these parts were essential to the star , and each had their own unique role to play 
 Without the golden - headed part , the star would not have been able to shine as brightly 
 The blue - eyed part gave the star its beautiful blue hue 
 The bright - eyed part ensured that the star always appeared to be twinkling 
 And the yellow - eyed part added a warm , inviting element to the star 
 Finally , the red - eyed part gave the star its power and energy 
 Together , these four parts created a star that was truly special 
 A star that was loved by all who saw it 
 It was a shock to ProtagonistA 
 But the doctor assured ProtagonistA that with treatment , ProtagonistA could still live a long and healthy life 
 ProtagonistA was relieved and grateful to the doctor for catching ProtagonistA's condition early 
 ProtagonistA 's determined to make the most of the time ProtagonistA has left 
 One day , ProtagonistA's kingdom was invaded by a group of aliens 
 The aliens were armed with powerful weapons and quickly took over the kingdom 
 ProtagonistA was captured and taken to the aliens ' home planet , where ProtagonistA was put on trial 
 The aliens found ProtagonistA guilty of numerous crimes and sentenced ProtagonistA to death 
 ProtagonistA was executed by the aliens and ProtagonistA's kingdom was left in ruins 
 Some said it was a place where the wicked were punished for their crimes 
 Others said it was a place where the lost souls wandered forever 
 Either way , ProtagonistA was determined to find it 
 It was hidden behind a waterfall , and it was said that only the damned could find it 
 Immediately , ProtagonistA was assaulted by the sounds of screams and tortured souls 
 The ground was hot beneath ProtagonistA's feet , and the air was thick with the stench of sulfur 
 Sitting on the throne was a figure clad in black , with a hood obscuring its face 
 The Devil just laughed 
  ProtagonistA knew exactly what ProtagonistA were doing ,  it said 
 And with that , ProtagonistA was dragged into the pits of hell , where ProtagonistA would suffer for eternity 
 ProtagonistB had planned to put ProtagonistA in there in the interests of peace , but ProtagonistB decided not to leave ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB wanted to be close to ProtagonistA in case ProtagonistA needed anything 
 ProtagonistA went it alone , and found the source of the problem : ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's career was saved , and ProtagonistA went on to help others in similar situations 
 When there 's a crime to be solved , or a perp to be apprehended , there 's no one better for the job than ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's colleagues respect ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's superiors trust ProtagonistA implicitly 
 ProtagonistB was so tall that ProtagonistB towered over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was born a pretty girl 
 ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA became friends and would often play together 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's life was a nightmare 
 Sleeping was a bitch , as ProtagonistA often said to ProtagonistA's cellmate , because it was hard to get comfortable on the hard , cold floor 
 The study was simple 
 ProtagonistA was given a comfortable bed in a private room , and ProtagonistA was told to sleep for eight hours a night 
 ProtagonistA was given a pillow and a blanket , and ProtagonistA was allowed to choose ProtagonistA's own sleeping position 
 ProtagonistA was also given a journal to write in , and ProtagonistA was told to keep track of ProtagonistA's dreams 
 ProtagonistA's nightmares became less frequent , and ProtagonistA began to feel more rested during the day 
 After a few weeks , ProtagonistA was released from the study , and ProtagonistA was given a copy of ProtagonistA's journal 
 ProtagonistA was told to keep it , so that ProtagonistA could look back on ProtagonistA's experience and remember how good it felt to sleep like a normal person 
 ProtagonistA was born in the middle of the desert , in the dead of winter , in a small , crowded town 
 ProtagonistB did n't make any difference , because nobody had ever had the misfortune of knowing what ProtagonistB was 
 Nobody was quite sure how they got into the place , or how they started 
 ProtagonistB was last seen heading into the woods and ProtagonistB had been gone for days 
 The men were discussing whether or not to go look for ProtagonistB 
 The men were disappointed but they thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's effort 
 They said they would go look for ProtagonistB themselves 
 ProtagonistB was a big dog , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly 
 They would walk for miles together , and ProtagonistA would always tell ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistC was carrying a large bag , and ProtagonistC looked like ProtagonistC was in a hurry 
 ProtagonistC walked up to ProtagonistA and pointed the gun at ProtagonistA 
  Give ProtagonistC ProtagonistA's money ,  ProtagonistC said 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
 ProtagonistA had never been robbed before , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was shaken , but ProtagonistA was unhurt 
 ProtagonistB listened carefully , and ProtagonistB looked sad 
 Fortunately , nothing did happen , and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB continued to walk and enjoy their life together 
They found ProtagonistA in a little room on the second floor of an apartment building , laying with ProtagonistA's eyes fixed upon a television screen , ProtagonistA's hands resting upon the table 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA had been there for some time , as the food on the table was long since cold and the television was still playing the same program 
 The police could n't figure out what had happened to ProtagonistA , but they knew that ProtagonistA was n't going to be able to help ProtagonistA 
 They took ProtagonistA to the hospital for evaluation and treatment 
 The sun was setting and the sky was ablaze with colors 
 Suddenly , the boat began to rock violently and ProtagonistA was thrown into the water 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was sweating and ProtagonistA's heart was pounding 
 ProtagonistA knew it was just a dream but it felt so real 
 It was early morning and the sun had just risen 
 They said they were from the government and that ProtagonistA needed to come with them 
 They put ProtagonistA in a car and drove ProtagonistA to a building 
 They took ProtagonistA into a room and sat ProtagonistA down 
 The men told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA's country was in danger and that ProtagonistA needed to leave 
 They said ProtagonistA would be taken to a safe place 
 The men told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA had to leave now and that ProtagonistA would be taken care of 
 ProtagonistA was put on a plane and taken to a new country 
Bob called me by my surname and we have been called by it ever since 
 It was a little strange at first , but I got used to it 
 Now , it just feels natural 
 I ca n't imagine being called by any other name 
 It was going well enough , but when ProtagonistA would begin the long , slow process of relocating from one place to another , the Living would always find a way to beat ProtagonistA to it 
 The Living were a group of supernatural beings that enjoyed causing mischief 
 They would often show up when ProtagonistA was in the middle of a move and mess everything up 
 They started messing with ProtagonistA's equipment and ProtagonistA quickly lost ProtagonistA's cool 
 They were no match for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA soon had them cornered 
 ProtagonistA was finally able to get rid of the Living and ProtagonistA finished the move without any further problems 
 The servants all bowed as ProtagonistA passed , and the ladies curtsied 
 Then , ProtagonistA was gone 
 ProtagonistA was n't used to seeing ProtagonistB in such a position of power 
 It was like there was a never - ending loop of thoughts playing in ProtagonistA's head 
 But even that did n't help 
 It was like ProtagonistA was living in a nightmare 
I hear the voice even now : ProtagonistA , has finished ProtagonistA's work 
 In this kingdom , there was no sickness , no sorrow , and no death 
 The sun was setting and the waves were crashing against the shore 
 The wave came closer and closer , until it was right on top of ProtagonistA 
 But it never came 
 The wave had passed right through ProtagonistA 
 Elizabeth , the wife of Mr
 Eliopolo , the Colonel of the Household at Court , and with whom ProtagonistA was always merry , and who was the cause of much expense to ProtagonistB's owing to the imprudence of ProtagonistB , for ProtagonistB had never thought of it before 
 They all greeted each other with great joy , and ProtagonistA immediately began to tell them of ProtagonistA's adventures since they had last seen each other 
 ProtagonistC listened attentively to everything ProtagonistA had to say , and when ProtagonistA had finished , ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA had seen any dragons 
 Mrs 
 Elizabeth then said that ProtagonistD had once seen a dragon , but it was many years ago and it was not nearly as big or as fierce as they were said to be 
 This only made ProtagonistC more eager to see one ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistC begged ProtagonistA to take ProtagonistC to see a dragon 
 They rode for many days , and finally came to a cave that was said to be the home of a dragon 
 They cautiously entered the cave , and sure enough , there was a dragon asleep in the middle of the cave 
 ProtagonistC was so excited that ProtagonistC could hardly contain ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistA and ProtagonistD made ProtagonistC stay back while they approached the dragon 
 When it saw the three of them , it immediately got up and began to roar 
 They were very lucky to escape , and ProtagonistC was thrilled to have seen a real dragon 
 The enemy was a race of giant creatures , twice the size of the largest man , and with a strength and ferocity that was unmatched 
 They were said to be able to rip a man apart with their bare hands , and they had destroyed entire civilizations 
 ProtagonistA's people had been fighting a losing battle for years , but ProtagonistA had a plan 
 What had happened to ProtagonistA ? 
It was whispered in the city that the king had died 
 On the night the king died , ProtagonistB was asleep and the king was watching over ProtagonistB 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistB woke up and saw the king 's body 
 ProtagonistB began to weep and the whole city heard ProtagonistB's cries 
 ProtagonistA's first kill was ProtagonistB 
 They had a one - night stand and afterwards , ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB 
It was on a dark and stormy night in July , 1639 , when ProtagonistB received an urgent and threatening communication in ProtagonistA's own chamber 
 ProtagonistB took it very seriously , as it was a matter of life and death 
 The communication said that the king had appointed ProtagonistA to receive the precepts of the church at Lambeth , in the kingdom of England , and that if ProtagonistA did not comply , ProtagonistA would be killed 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA would not want to risk ProtagonistA's life , so ProtagonistB went to Lambeth and delivered the message 
After the war ended , a little more than a year earlier , we settled in a house in the district of St
 Peter 's , in which ProtagonistA had done the best ProtagonistA could 
 We were all happy to be together again as a family and to have a roof over our heads 
 Unfortunately , our happiness was short - lived 
 ProtagonistA was killed in a car accident just a few months after we moved in 
 We were all devastated 
 ProtagonistA was the only one who really knew how to fix things around the house , so after ProtagonistA died , we had to hire someone to do all the repairs that ProtagonistA had been doing 
 It was expensive and we struggled to make ends meet 
 We all missed ProtagonistA terribly , but we knew that we had to keep going for ProtagonistA's sake 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how it had led ProtagonistA to this point 
ProtagonistA can remember the last time ProtagonistA had sex like it was yesterday 
 Unfortunately , all good things must come to an end , and ProtagonistA's sex life is no exception 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA 'll have to face death eventually , but ProtagonistA ca n't help but feel grateful for the memories ProtagonistA has of the good times ProtagonistA 's had with ProtagonistA's partner 
 ProtagonistA was called the Angel of Death , or rather the Angel of Death , because ProtagonistA had the audacity to become the Victim of a horrible and terrible crime , which is the least of all crimes 
 ProtagonistA was loved by everyone , and ProtagonistA's death was a shock to the world 
 The first thing that struck ProtagonistA was the size of the new room ; it was so much larger than the old one that it quite overpowered ProtagonistA 
 The second thing was the number of people in it ; there must have been at least a hundred , and they were all talking at once 
 The third thing was the way they were dressed ; they were all in full evening dress , and ProtagonistA felt quite out of place in ProtagonistA's shabby clothes 
 The fourth thing was the way they were sitting ; they were all sitting on the floor , and ProtagonistA could not help feeling that they looked like a lot of schoolboys 
 The fifth thing was the way they were behaving ; they were all talking and laughing and joking , and ProtagonistA could not help wondering what they could find to laugh at 
The cloth mops quivered as the dozen men turned into the small , well - furnished , and hot - air - conditioned office of ProtagonistA's 
 In which , the same season which saw the improved condition of the city , ProtagonistA was obliged to allow , from a personal profit of about £ 400 , the privilege of paying a visit to one or two of ProtagonistA's favourite ladies , in whose houses ProtagonistA had been frequenting the summer before , and who were then , in the opinion of ProtagonistA , in a state of excess to be governed , and who were therefore ProtagonistA in a very extraordinary state of want , in spite of so much the best of means and of the best society 
You ca n't be the father of ProtagonistA 
 You just ca n't 
 You would have had to have been a teenager when ProtagonistA was born 
 There 's just no way 
 But , still , you ca n't help but wonder 
 And your nose 
 And your smile 
 Surely there must be some explanation 
 You decide to confront ProtagonistA about it 
  ProtagonistA , I need to know 
 Are ProtagonistA my son?He looks at you , stunned 
  What ? No , of course not 
 ProtagonistA 'm your nephew 
  relief washes over you 
 You were beginning to think you were losing your mind 
  Thank goodness ,  you say 
  I was beginning to think I was losing my mind 
 No source of the sound , no nothing 
 This time it was closer 
 It looked at ProtagonistA with its big , black eyes and then scurried away 
There was once ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA went walking after dark and never stopped 
 In the clearing was a big , old house 
 It was all made of stone , and it had a big , old door 
  The voice said ,  Come in , ProtagonistA 
 I 've been expecting ProtagonistA 
I have been listening to the last of the bishoprics and continuing to write to ProtagonistA , to inform ProtagonistA of my intention of moving to Canterbury - upon - Avon 
 The small town has always been a dream of mine and I am finally making it a reality 
 I have already put my house on the market and plan to be out of here within the month 
 I know that ProtagonistA will be sad to see me go , but I promise to keep in touch and visit often 
 I have already started packing my bags and can not wait to start this new chapter in my life 
 Thank ProtagonistA for everything , ProtagonistA 
 I will never forget ProtagonistA's kindness 
 It was a beautiful day outside , and ProtagonistA did n't want to miss a minute of it 
 ProtagonistA had been cooped up inside for too long and was finally able to get out and enjoy the fresh air 
 Some of them were friendly , and some of them were not 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would buy a big house and a fast car 
 ProtagonistB laughed and said that ProtagonistA was too nice to ever win the lottery 
 But , as it turned out , ProtagonistB was wrong 
 As ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA's dreams became more and more wild , until they reached a point where they seemed impossible 
 ProtagonistB was fascinated by everything ProtagonistA did and wanted to know more about ProtagonistA's dreams 
 It was a wish , a great wish , a frightful wish , a terrible wish 
 But it was also the most wonderful thing ProtagonistA had ever dreamed of 
 And it was all worth it , because eventually , ProtagonistA's dream came true 
 ProtagonistA's feet were numb and ProtagonistA's body was shaking with cold , but ProtagonistA kept walking 
 But then , the ice cracked open and came with an awed howl of despair as it lifted up ProtagonistA , dragging ProtagonistA along the bottom , and tugging at ProtagonistA's hair 
 ProtagonistA's body was never found 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's job , bought a huge house , and started traveling the world 
 It was a creature unlike anything ProtagonistA had ever seen before , and it filled ProtagonistA with terror 
 ProtagonistA was paralyzed with fear 
 Suddenly , the creature was gone , and ProtagonistA was left alone in the woods 
 It was then that ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been living in fear ProtagonistA's whole life 
ProtagonistA's eyes were aflame with curiosity as ProtagonistA listened to the news 
 ProtagonistA was riveted to the radio as the reporter described the events unfolding in the country 
 It was a very volatile situation and it sounded like it could erupt into violence at any moment 
ProtagonistB had always told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was special , that one day ProtagonistA would do something great 
 One day , as ProtagonistA stood in the garden of ProtagonistB's house , tracing the outlines of the structure ProtagonistA had built there on the foundations of the old stone house , the man who would become known as the Great Scribe of the Old Testament , or , as some people called ProtagonistC , the Habite Cretan , or simply the Lost Scribe , began to write 
 ProtagonistC had been searching for years for someone who could understand ProtagonistC's work , and when ProtagonistC saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC knew ProtagonistC had found ProtagonistC's successor 
 And so began ProtagonistA's journey to becoming the greatest scribe of ProtagonistA's generation 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the TV was out of stock and would not be available for weeks 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the TV was out of stock and would not be available for weeks 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the TV was out of stock and would not be available for weeks 
 ProtagonistA was fed up 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the TV was out of stock and would not be available for weeks 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the TV was out of stock and would not be available for weeks 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the TV was out of stock and would not be available for weeks 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the TV was out of stock and would not be available for weeks 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the TV was out of stock and would not be available for weeks 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the TV was out of stock and would not be available for weeks 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a voice in ProtagonistA's head say 
The gods had finally worked out that , if ProtagonistA were to find a way to put an end to the anarchy that had swept the earth in the course of the last three thousand years , ProtagonistA would have to take refuge in a city of indeterminate size and location 
 The gods did not want to see their creation destroyed , so they decided to give ProtagonistA this one chance to save it 
 ProtagonistA was relieved and happy to have finally found the city 
 There were no people , no animals , and no signs of life 
 The statue was of ProtagonistA , and it was wearing a crown 
I remember as a child very well what it was like to grow up in a house with ProtagonistA , and the duty of having trouble with ProtagonistA 
 It seemed like every other day ProtagonistA would be getting into some sort of mischief , and my parents would have to scold ProtagonistA 
 I would always try to stay out of ProtagonistA's way , but inevitably I would end up getting caught up in ProtagonistA's shenanigans 
 Even though ProtagonistA was always causing trouble , I could n't help but to love ProtagonistA 
 Looking back , I cherish those memories of growing up with ProtagonistA 
 The sun was just starting to peek over the horizon , and the birds were singing in the trees 
 Bob ! What are ProtagonistA doing?Bob turned around to see ProtagonistB , standing there with a look of disbelief on ProtagonistB's face 
 But why ?  ProtagonistB asked 
  We have a perfectly good house that we just bought 
 But why now ? We just bought this house and we 're already in debt up to our eyeballs 
 ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head and walked back to the car 
Bob was happy when I first met ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a true man of God and I admired ProtagonistA for that 
 ProtagonistA was known for ProtagonistA's profound knowledge of everything of which ProtagonistA was concerned 
 ProtagonistA's extensive labour did not oblige ProtagonistA to mention any of this to ProtagonistA's customers 
Bob was the god of the seas , and a man like ProtagonistA had a hard time determining ProtagonistA's true identity 
ProtagonistB demanded twenty - five dollars , but ProtagonistA could hardly have imagined that ProtagonistA 'd be obliged to pay that load 
 It was ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was relieved and thankful that ProtagonistA was able to pay ProtagonistB and get on with ProtagonistA's day 
 Eventually , the sun started to set , and ProtagonistA knew that it was time to stop working and go inside 
 When ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB said ,  That 's a very nice name 
 ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA 'll be a great success in life 
 ProtagonistA's uncle just smiled and said ,  That 's very nice , ProtagonistA , but do n't let it go to ProtagonistA's head 
 It ran as follows :  My dear subjects , I am very sorry to say that I am obliged to leave you for a short time on account of the illness of ProtagonistC 
 I hope , however , to return before long , and in the meantime I trust that you will all behave as dutifully and obediently as you have done in the past 
 ProtagonistB sincerely , ProtagonistB 
  Of course we were all very sorry to hear of ProtagonistC's illness , and we all wished ProtagonistC a speedy recovery ; but as for ProtagonistB , we thought that ProtagonistB might have stayed with us a little longer , considering the short time ProtagonistB had been with us , and the great expense we had incurred on ProtagonistB's account 
 ProtagonistA's imagination was limitless and ProtagonistA loved getting lost in ProtagonistA's own world 
 ProtagonistA even got to fight a dragon ! It was the best dream ProtagonistA had ever had 
 It had been a tough week at work and ProtagonistA was really looking forward to the weekend 
 ProtagonistB was beautiful , and ProtagonistB was looking right at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB smiled and said yes 
 They ended up talking for hours , and ProtagonistA had the best night of ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistB was waiting for ProtagonistA , just as ProtagonistA usually was 
 ProtagonistB had been waiting for ProtagonistA for hours , and ProtagonistB was getting impatient 
 ProtagonistB was about to leave when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA walking towards ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was relieved and happy to see ProtagonistA 
 It was not long before ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA was being mentioned in whispers 
 Surely that would be enough to get ProtagonistA into heaven 
 The man said that there was only one way to heaven , and ProtagonistA was n't following it 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
 The man told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to accept ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA's personal savior in order to get to heaven 
 The man told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to repent of ProtagonistA's sins and ask ProtagonistB into ProtagonistA's heart 
 Was ProtagonistA finally being accepted ? Or were people talking about ProtagonistA behind ProtagonistA's back?He tried to listen in on conversations to see if ProtagonistA could figure it out , but it was hard to catch anything 
 They were discussing ProtagonistA's nationality and how ProtagonistA did n't quite seem to fit in with the rest of the community 
 At first , ProtagonistA was hurt 
 It had been a long day , and ProtagonistA was tired 
 It was ProtagonistA's favorite time of day 
 No one knew where ProtagonistA took them , but they were never seen again 
 Some said that ProtagonistA took them to the underworld , others said that ProtagonistA ate them 
 But no one knew for sure 
 ProtagonistB was a young woman who was out walking alone 
 ProtagonistB screamed , but it was too late 
 The villagers were terrified of ProtagonistA and no one ever went out alone at night again 
 They would huddle together in their homes , afraid to even step outside 
 But one day , ProtagonistC decided to take a stand 
 ProtagonistC grabbed a pitchfork and went out to confront ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA came for ProtagonistC , ProtagonistC was ready 
 ProtagonistC stabbed ProtagonistA with the pitchfork and ProtagonistA let out a cry of pain 
 The villagers came out of their homes and saw that ProtagonistA was bleeding 
 They surrounded ProtagonistA and took ProtagonistA away 
 The villagers were finally free from ProtagonistA's terror 
 But they never forgot the night when ProtagonistA came and took ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was covered in sweat and ProtagonistA's eyes were darting around the room 
 I did n't know what to do , so I called for a doctor 
 ProtagonistA was rushed into surgery and I never saw ProtagonistA again 
 ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's best friend 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistA's parents took ProtagonistA to get a new pet rock and ProtagonistA named it Bob 2
 ProtagonistA loved the way they could transport ProtagonistA to different worlds , or teach ProtagonistA things ProtagonistA never would have known otherwise 
 Suddenly , there was a knock at the door 
 The man did not say a word , but simply handed ProtagonistA an envelope 
 The man in black turned and walked away , and ProtagonistA went back into ProtagonistA's study 
 Inside was a single sheet of paper , on which was written , in a neat hand , ' On the night that ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's study in the Court of the Tuileries , looking at an old and heavy book which was lying upon a table 
Bob , kept up for the last two years of the reign of Suddistharma , a fine , fine trade and business , in which the prosperity of the kingdom depended greatly , from a view of employment to the general good , and from a view of revenue to the interest of a great many millions of pounds , which ProtagonistA called a royal prerogative , and which ProtagonistA possessed by extraction , or some other means which I may not venture to mention here , although , in truth , it was of considerable consequence to ProtagonistA's current business 
 ProtagonistA knew they would come eventually ; they always did 
 After a few hours , the deer appeared , and ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's shot 
 ProtagonistA had been attacked by a deer before , and ProtagonistA did n't want to take any chances 
 But this deer was dead , and ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's dinner 
 Samuel Church of the City College of that city caressed ProtagonistA's nose and said , with a smile over his mouth ,  I do n't suppose he've ever heard of the Luke the Great?Bob , who had just turned eighteen and was fresh out of high school , was taken aback 
 Well , then ,  Mr
 Church said ,  I shall have to tell ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was a man who lived many years ago , and ProtagonistB was a great thinker and philosopher 
 ProtagonistB wrote many books , and ProtagonistB's ideas are still studied and discussed by scholars today 
 I think ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistB's work very interesting , ProtagonistA 
 I suggest ProtagonistA go to the library and look ProtagonistB up 
 ProtagonistA was intrigued 
 Soon , ProtagonistA was known as the new Luke the Great , and ProtagonistA's ideas were spreading far and wide 
I remember when ProtagonistA added England to the list of places ProtagonistA visited 
 ProtagonistA never left England , thank heaven 
 But when ProtagonistA added England to ProtagonistA's list of places visited , it was a bit of a shock 
 But England had always been ProtagonistA's home 
 So when ProtagonistA added England to ProtagonistA's list of places visited , it was like ProtagonistA was finally admitting that ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's home 
 It was a beautiful , pure white blanket that covered the ground and made everything look so clean and new 
 One winter , ProtagonistA's dream finally came true 
 It was the best day ever!Even though ProtagonistA is now an adult , ProtagonistA still loves the snow and looks forward to it every year 
 It always brings back happy memories of that one magical winter 
There was once ProtagonistA , and at the age of eleven ProtagonistA could see the future 
 ProtagonistB did n't believe ProtagonistA at first , but ProtagonistA was able to convince ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB evacuated the city , and when the fire came , it was nowhere near as bad as it could have been 
 ProtagonistB was the only one who knew ProtagonistA's true name , and ProtagonistB was the only one who knew the truth about what had happened to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been there that day , and ProtagonistB had seen the terror in ProtagonistA's eyes as the demon approached 
 ProtagonistB had tried to warn ProtagonistA , to tell ProtagonistA to run , but it was too late 
 The demon had reached ProtagonistA and had taken ProtagonistA away 
 ProtagonistB had never seen ProtagonistA since , but ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was still out there somewhere , being tortured by that demon 
 ProtagonistB vowed to ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB would find ProtagonistA and rescue ProtagonistA , no matter what it took 
 One day , ProtagonistB's search led ProtagonistB to a dark , abandoned castle 
 ProtagonistB knew that this was where the demon was keeping ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB was determined to get ProtagonistA out 
 ProtagonistB fought ProtagonistB's way through the castle , battling demons and overcoming obstacles , until ProtagonistB finally reached ProtagonistA's prison cell 
 ProtagonistB fought the demon and freed ProtagonistA , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistA had been tortured for so long that ProtagonistA was no longer the happy boy that ProtagonistA once was 
 ProtagonistA was broken , and ProtagonistA could never be the same again 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA away from that place and tried to care for ProtagonistA , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistB never forgot ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB always regretted that ProtagonistB could n't save ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB vowed to never rest until ProtagonistB had avenged ProtagonistA's death and destroyed the demon that had taken ProtagonistA away from the world 
 The sun had long set and the waves were crashing against the rocks , but there was still a light shining from the top of the lighthouse 
 It was ProtagonistB's voice , and ProtagonistB was singing 
 ProtagonistB's hair was blowing in the wind , and ProtagonistB's eyes were shining 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a white dress , and ProtagonistB looked like an angel 
 ProtagonistB stopped singing and looked at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart stop 
 Then ProtagonistB spoke 
  Hello , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB 've been waiting for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB came closer to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could feel the heat of ProtagonistB's body 
  ProtagonistB 'm the devil , ProtagonistA 
 And ProtagonistB 've come to take ProtagonistA to hell 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA by the hand , and ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB into the darkness 
ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to see ProtagonistC 
 It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever seen ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA was very excited 
 ProtagonistB was a big man with a bushy beard and ProtagonistA could n't help but stare at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a suit and tie and looked very handsome 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA by the hand and led ProtagonistA into the room where ProtagonistC was 
 ProtagonistC was sitting in a chair with ProtagonistC's eyes closed 
 ProtagonistC looked very peaceful 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to sit down next to ProtagonistC 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistC opened ProtagonistC's eyes and smiled at ProtagonistA 
 Hello , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said 
  ProtagonistC 'm so glad ProtagonistA 're here 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 They had been dating for two years and were very happy together 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
There was once , and there will always be one , Doctor LeDeux , a man who said ProtagonistA was going to be a god and that ProtagonistA was going to take over the universe and rule it and make the best of it 
 ProtagonistB was starting to believe it 
 ProtagonistA was confronted by a being made of pure energy , who said that ProtagonistA was not fit to rule the universe 
 ProtagonistA was shocked and tried to fight back , but ProtagonistA was no match for this being 
 ProtagonistA was banished from the universe and left to roam the cosmos for eternity 
 As for ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB was left to ponder what could have been 
 ProtagonistB had helped create a god , but in the end , it was all for nothing 
 I was struck by ProtagonistA's handsome features and ProtagonistA's intense blue eyes 
 We began talking and I soon learned that ProtagonistA was a widower who had moved to Nantucket to be closer to ProtagonistA's daughter and grandkids 
 We hit it off immediately and have been friends ever since 
 But ProtagonistA was not forgotten 
 ProtagonistA was still remembered by ProtagonistA's subjects , and they still loved ProtagonistA 
 They loved ProtagonistA so much that they decided to honor ProtagonistA by making ProtagonistA their new king 
 And so ProtagonistA was made king , and ProtagonistA ruled over ProtagonistA's kingdom with wisdom and compassion 
 They struck up a conversation and quickly became friends 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB found out about the friendship and was not happy 
 ProtagonistB demanded that ProtagonistA end it 
 ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA was grateful for the time they had together 
 ProtagonistB was a handsome young man with golden hair and blue eyes 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a white toga and sandals 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was the god of love and beauty and that ProtagonistB had come to ProtagonistA because ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA's paintings and thought that they were beautiful 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB wanted to make ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's apprentice and teach ProtagonistA everything about love and beauty 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled and agreed to be ProtagonistB's apprentice 
When ProtagonistA had reached ProtagonistA's thirtieth year , the celebrated author works of M
 de la Tourgave presented themselves before ProtagonistA in extraordinary fashion 
 It was as if the pages had come to life , and the characters were speaking directly to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was entranced by the story , and ProtagonistA followed along eagerly as the plot unfolded before ProtagonistA's eyes 
 de la Tourgave was pleased with how ProtagonistB's work was being received , and ProtagonistB chatted with ProtagonistA for a while about the story 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled to be able to talk to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was eager to ask questions about the characters and the plot 
 ProtagonistB was happy to answer all of ProtagonistA's questions , and ProtagonistB even gave ProtagonistA some insight into the writing process 
 ProtagonistA 's already been approached by a few record labels , but ProtagonistA 's not sure if ProtagonistA wants to pursue a career in music just yet 
 The concert was amazing and ProtagonistA had a great time 
 They were all very friendly and thanked ProtagonistA for coming 
 It was a special place to ProtagonistA , a place where ProtagonistA could feel close to nature 
 ProtagonistA could feel the energy of the land beneath ProtagonistA's feet and it was exhilarating 
 It was a perfect day 
 ProtagonistC , asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA wanted to go all the way to Washington just to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA should go , and that ProtagonistC would take care of the house and the children while ProtagonistA was gone 
 ProtagonistA was told that ProtagonistB was busy , but ProtagonistA could wait in the waiting room 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistB came out and ProtagonistA was able to shake ProtagonistB's hand 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA did for a living , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was a farmer 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA was doing a great job and that ProtagonistB was proud of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was always very dirty and ProtagonistA's clothes were tattered 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to the village and saw ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB took pity on ProtagonistA and took ProtagonistA under ProtagonistB's wing 
 ProtagonistB taught ProtagonistA how to read and write and how to do business 
 ProtagonistB was cowering in the corner , begging for ProtagonistA to stop 
 No pity , no love , no nothing 
 They had a happy life together and were always doing something new and exciting 
 One of their favorite things to do was go on adventures in the Welsh countryside 
 They would explore abandoned castles , go on long hikes , and just enjoy each other 's company 
 One day , they were out on one of their adventures and came across a cave that they had never seen before 
 They decided to explore it and , to their surprise , found a secret passage that led them to a hidden underground room 
 In the room , they found a treasure trove of ancient artifacts and gold 
 They were amazed at their find and quickly decided to take as much as they could carry back with them 
 They were so excited to get back home and show their new treasure to everyone 
 Unfortunately , on the way back , they ran into some trouble and were attacked by a group of bandits 
 The bandits took everything from them , leaving them with nothing 
 ProtagonistA and Catherine were heartbroken 
 They had lost everything they had worked so hard for 
 But , they still had each other and they vowed to never give up 
 They would find a way to get their treasure back and make those bandits pay 
The feathered birds had listened to an order ProtagonistA given ProtagonistA 
 The birds knew this , and so they did as ProtagonistA said 
 They flew into the cauldron and began to cook 
 It was n't long before they were done 
 Because of this , the other kids called ProtagonistA Jerome 
 ProtagonistA was used to being alone 
 But one day , everything changed 
 ProtagonistB was kind and friendly and ProtagonistB actually wanted to be friends with ProtagonistA 
 It just meant that ProtagonistA had to be a little more open to making friends 
As the sun shone in the days that followed the death of the father , Robert Prynne , the death of once and a new father , the death of a sister and the death of a niece , and the marriage of a brother , and the death of a brother - in - law , there came into existence in Ireland of ProtagonistA , a new life , ProtagonistA and a new husband 
 ProtagonistA was no longer the carefree young man ProtagonistA had been before , but a husband and father with a great deal of weight on ProtagonistA's shoulders 
 Despite the sadness of the recent events , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA happy in ProtagonistA's new life , and ProtagonistA was grateful for the sun that shone down on ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's new family in the days that followed 
The first time I saw ProtagonistA , I was immediately drawn to ProtagonistA 
 I knew I had to get to know ProtagonistA 
 We became fast friends and would do everything together 
 I was never happier than when I was with ProtagonistA 
 But then one day , ProtagonistA was gone 
 I was heartbroken 
 I did n't know what to do without ProtagonistA 
 I tried to find ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was gone for good 
 I never saw ProtagonistA again 
 I still miss ProtagonistA every day 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was leaving ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had found someone else and that ProtagonistB was happier with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistA was lost without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's kids did n't want to see ProtagonistA either 
 They said that ProtagonistA was a bad father 
I was born into an unforgiving world , a world where ProtagonistA's honour was worth the most trivial of things , such as the way ProtagonistA dressed , or the way ProtagonistA spoke , or how ProtagonistA acted toward women 
 I never understood why this was , but it did n't matter , because I was born into a world where ProtagonistA was the king 
 And I loved ProtagonistA for it 
 I loved ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's honour , and I loved ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's strength 
 But one day , I saw ProtagonistA act in a way that I could n't forgive 
 I left ProtagonistA , and I never looked back 
  ProtagonistA 'm not sure what the future holds , but ProtagonistA 'm grateful for what we have now 
  It 's been a difficult year for everyone , and ProtagonistA's words are a reminder that we should all be grateful for what we have 
 Even though the future is uncertain , we can still appreciate the good things in our lives 
There is an old adage among the missionaries that ProtagonistA can do anything except what ProtagonistA has been taught to do 
 ProtagonistA has been taught to read , but ProtagonistA ca n't be bothered to do it 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled with ProtagonistA's new found power and started to use it to help people 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled with ProtagonistA's new found power and started to use it to help people 
ProtagonistA had been diagnosed with cancer a few months ago and given only six months to live 
 The cancer was too aggressive 
 It was a sign that ProtagonistA's time was up 
The last time ProtagonistA was seen alive , ProtagonistB thought that ProtagonistA had been already dead for some years 
 But when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA's body moving , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was still alive 
 ProtagonistA's eyes were open , but they were lifeless and empty 
 ProtagonistB could see the life draining out of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's body was cold , but ProtagonistA's soul was already in the underworld 
Robert of Moray had been dying of a heart attack for some weeks before ProtagonistA's parents found ProtagonistA , in a pool underneath the stairs , still alive 
 ProtagonistA's parents were shocked and amazed that ProtagonistA was still alive and decided to take ProtagonistA to the hospital immediately 
 After a few weeks of treatment , ProtagonistA was finally released from the hospital and is now doing well 
The moment ProtagonistA appeared , all eyes in the garden were riveted on ProtagonistA 
 Everyone was hanging on ProtagonistA's every word 
 ProtagonistB was a prefect who had recently been promoted and who had considerable interests in politics and mathematics 
 ProtagonistA was tasked with finding out more about ProtagonistB and determining what kind of person ProtagonistB really was 
 They discovered that ProtagonistB was very intelligent and well - spoken , with a great deal of knowledge on a variety of topics 
 ProtagonistB was also very polite and seemed to have a genuine interest in others 
 ProtagonistB was someone who could be trusted and who would be a great asset to the Hyatt Regency 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was always surrounded by beautiful women and ProtagonistA lived a life of luxury 
 The centurion looked at ProtagonistA , not sure what to say 
 For in the end , tyrants always fall 
ProtagonistA's parents had suspected all along that ProtagonistA had what was known as the infectious mind 
 They had seen the way ProtagonistA would light up a room with ProtagonistA's smile , and the way ProtagonistA would always be the first to start a conversation 
 They knew that ProtagonistA was always the life of the party , and that ProtagonistA was always up for a good time 
 They also knew that ProtagonistA was always quick to make friends , and that ProtagonistA was always the one to make everyone feel welcome 
 They had never been sure what it was that made ProtagonistA so special , but they knew that it was something that could n't be taught 
 They had always just assumed that ProtagonistA was born with it , and that it was something that ProtagonistA would always have 
 As ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA's parents started to notice that ProtagonistA was having a bit more trouble making friends 
 ProtagonistA's parents started to worry that ProtagonistA was losing ProtagonistA's infectious mind , but they did n't know how to help ProtagonistA 
 They had always just assumed that it was something ProtagonistA would always have , but now they were n't so sure 
 One day , ProtagonistA's parents sat ProtagonistA down and talked to ProtagonistA about what was going on 
 They asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA was still enjoying ProtagonistA's life , and if ProtagonistA was still happy 
 ProtagonistA's parents were relieved to hear this , and they told ProtagonistA that they were always there for ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA needed anything 
 They also told ProtagonistA to never give up on ProtagonistA's infectious mind , because it was something that was special and unique to ProtagonistA 
I shall not deny that ProtagonistA had a lively mind and was one of the greatest of men from pre - eminence to greatness , in every respect , as well as in every regard , as ProtagonistA may hereafter appear 
 ProtagonistC worked as a maid and did ProtagonistC's best to keep the family afloat 
 ProtagonistB was the youngest of thirty - four children and was only fourteen when ProtagonistB's family moved to Melbourne 
 Despite the difficult circumstances , ProtagonistB's family was happy and close - knit 
 ProtagonistB believed ProtagonistA and worked hard in school 
 ProtagonistB was determined to make ProtagonistB's family proud 
 When ProtagonistB graduated from high school , ProtagonistB was the first in ProtagonistB's family to go to college 
 ProtagonistB studied hard and eventually became a successful lawyer 
 ProtagonistB always remembered the advice ProtagonistA had given ProtagonistB and was determined to make ProtagonistB's family proud 
 The victim was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was shocked and horrified by the news 
 ProtagonistB's name was Julie , and ProtagonistB was a beautiful and talented artist 
 The police had no leads in the case , and ProtagonistA was determined to find out who had killed ProtagonistB 
All right , said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA walked through the open door , ProtagonistA 'll record it all for you 
 The first thing ProtagonistA noticed was the smell 
 It was a mixture of sweat , blood , and fear 
 The second thing ProtagonistA noticed was the sound 
 There was a constant screaming , punctuated by the occasional sob or moan 
 And the third thing ProtagonistA noticed was the sight 
 The room was filled with people 
 They were chained to the walls , their clothes in tatters 
 Some had open wounds that were oozing blood 
 Others had bruises covering their bodies 
 And all of them had a look of terror in their eyes 
 This was a nightmare , and ProtagonistA had to make sure people knew about it 
 And ProtagonistA's hard work paid off 
 People started to take notice of ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA's ambition did n't stop there 
 But ProtagonistA's ambition did n't stop there 
 But ProtagonistA's ambition did n't stop there 
 And then , one day , ProtagonistA's ambition finally caught up with ProtagonistA 
 And then , ProtagonistA's enemies caught up with ProtagonistA 
 They killed ProtagonistA 
 They put an end to ProtagonistA's ambition 
 They ended ProtagonistA's story 
ProtagonistA was not a sailor , for ProtagonistA had sailed south through a sea of ice and snow , and more than once had visited the tundra of Alaska 
 A small opening in the side of the pyramid 
 In the center of the room was a stone table 
 On the table was a golden key 
 The key would unlock the door to the treasure 
 It wrapped itself around ProtagonistA and squeezed 
On the afternoon of the last Saturday of the month , February , 1882 , there was born to ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB was also very happy , as ProtagonistB had always wanted a daughter 
 ProtagonistC was a very healthy baby , and the parents were very proud of ProtagonistC 
 When ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistA was left with the feeling that ProtagonistA had outlived ProtagonistA's usefulness 
 The only thing that kept ProtagonistA going was the knowledge that ProtagonistA had to take care of their son 
 But even that was not enough 
 It was a new beginning for ProtagonistA 
 The people were friendly and the landscape was beautiful 
In the year 1252 , when the eastern wall of Constantinople began to give way , the Spaniard Iberico de Este , who , in spite of the worst hardships ProtagonistA had to endure , as a soldier of fortune , and in spite of the most abject conditions ProtagonistA had met in life , had made another discovery 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB looked around , and then ProtagonistB began to dig through the rubble ProtagonistB 
The flame of the fire should have been kindled as soon as ProtagonistA had walked all the way into the kitchen , when ProtagonistA was able to put ProtagonistA's legs through the doors and let the light burn on ProtagonistA 
 However , the fire was not lit and ProtagonistA had to fumble around in the dark for a match 
 There were dirty dishes everywhere and the floor was cluttered with food wrappers and other trash 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 It looked like it had been there for years , and it had a very inviting atmosphere 
 ProtagonistB was very skinny and looked like ProtagonistB had n't been cared for in a long time 
 The owner said yes , and ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB home with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB changed ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA was finally happy 
 ProtagonistA was always smiling and laughing , even when ProtagonistA was about to do something mean 
 People did n't know whether to trust ProtagonistA or not , but they usually ended up being the butt of ProtagonistA's jokes 
 The woman stopped and looked at ProtagonistA suspiciously 
  ProtagonistB 'm not sure ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB do n't want to be the one who gets laughed at 
 There was a man who went to a psychiatrist and said , ' I think I 'm a chicken 
 ' The psychiatrist said , ' That 's ridiculous 
 You 're a man , not a chicken 
 ' The man said , ' I know I 'm a man , but I still think I 'm a chicken 
 'The woman laughed and said ,  That 's a good one 
 ProtagonistB 'm glad ProtagonistB did n't pass up on hearing it 
 ProtagonistB had red eyes and a long tail 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would grant ProtagonistA any wish ProtagonistA wanted 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA's wish would be granted , but ProtagonistA would have to give ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's soul in return 
 ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a bag of money and ProtagonistA went home 
 ProtagonistA's parents were very happy to see the money and they asked ProtagonistA where ProtagonistA got it 
 ProtagonistA's parents were very worried and they told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had to give the money back 
 ProtagonistA was taken to the hospital and had to have surgery 
 ProtagonistA was forced to find a new job and start a new life 
 ProtagonistB , was just standing there , looking around 
 The next day , ProtagonistB was still there 
 Hey , ProtagonistB 
 What are ProtagonistB doing?I'm just looking around ,  ProtagonistB , said 
 ProtagonistB had nowhere to go and was just trying to figure out what to do 
 ProtagonistB was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistB eventually agreed 
 ProtagonistB eventually saved up enough money to get ProtagonistB's own place 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for everything before ProtagonistB left 
The first rumor that ProtagonistA had hired a team of assassins to kill the father of one of ProtagonistA's cousins spread like wildfire 
 Many people believed it , despite the fact that the mother of the youngest child , who was not numbered among the deceased , was sitting in the car with the first degree of the court of coroner 
In the year 1447 , when Shakespeare became known throughout Europe , the world was in a state of great excitement 
 A helian creature , or a celestial being , or one of the pre - existent things , known to men as angels , appeared to speak to ProtagonistA , and to tell ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was destined to be king ; and , further , that ProtagonistA would be the prince of heaven , or lord of heaven , or prince of the whole world , or emperor of the whole earth and the king of men ; and that all the rest of the world was bound to obey ProtagonistA , or else perish ; for , said the angel , I have made the establishment of the kingdom of heaven , or one of the things , for the good of mankind , and will not have it destroyed by the disobedience of a single person 
 ProtagonistA was immediately smitten with ProtagonistB and they began dating 
 They were very happy together and decided to get married 
 However , just before their wedding , ProtagonistB's family found out that ProtagonistB was already pregnant with ProtagonistA's child 
 They were furious and disowned ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were forced to get married in secret and move away from Detroit 
 They had ProtagonistC and named ProtagonistC after ProtagonistB's grandmother 
 They were very happy together and lived happily ever after 
In the year 1250 , the year of the Exodus , ProtagonistB appeared to ProtagonistA on Mount Sinai with a vision , telling ProtagonistA of ProtagonistC 
 I never got to meet ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB always talks about ProtagonistA like ProtagonistA was the best thing that ever happened to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB says that ProtagonistA was always so full of life and always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 Even though ProtagonistA 's gone , I know that ProtagonistA 's watching over us and that ProtagonistA 's still with us in spirit 
ProtagonistA had been married before , but ProtagonistA's first wife had died tragically in a car accident 
 ProtagonistB was kind , gentle , and loving , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could finally be ProtagonistA again 
 However , the marriage was not an easy one 
 ProtagonistB's family was very religious , and they did not approve of ProtagonistA's lifestyle 
 With time and patience , they were finally able to overcome the obstacles in their relationship , and they enjoyed many happy years together 
There was a man in the country , near the village of Mistral , who was a farmer , very much concerned for the welfare of Bob 's own family , and who had some of the best cattle and sheep in the country , and was very fond of ProtagonistA's poultry , and had a good deal of money in ProtagonistA's account , where ProtagonistA could always find a good price for them 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was out in ProtagonistA's fields , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking along the road , and ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB ,  Hey , ProtagonistB ! Come over here , and ProtagonistA 'll give ProtagonistB a job !  ProtagonistB , came over , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA needed someone to help ProtagonistA with the farm work 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would be happy to help , and so ProtagonistB went to work for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB , for ProtagonistB's part , was very happy to have found a place where ProtagonistB felt ProtagonistB belonged 
 ProtagonistB worked hard , and the farm prospered 
 One day , when ProtagonistB was out working in the fields , ProtagonistB saw a group of men on horseback coming down the road 
 As they got closer , ProtagonistB could see that they were wearing the uniforms of ProtagonistC's soldiers 
 ProtagonistB went to ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA what ProtagonistB had seen 
 The leader of the soldiers told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC was going to war , and that ProtagonistC was conscripting all the able - bodied men in the country to fight 
 The soldier said that it did n't matter , and that ProtagonistB would have to go with them 
 ProtagonistB was taken away , and ProtagonistA was left alone on ProtagonistA's farm 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to keep going , for the sake of ProtagonistA's family 
 When ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB ran to ProtagonistA and they embraced each other , tears of joy streaming down their faces 
 They went back to the farmhouse , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA all about ProtagonistB's adventures in the war 
 I was at ProtagonistA's bedside when ProtagonistA passed away , and I will never forget the look on ProtagonistA's face 
 It was as if ProtagonistA had seen a ghost 
 It was all ProtagonistA's fault 
 But ProtagonistA had n't and now the world was paying the price 
 Everyone ProtagonistA had ever known was gone ; killed by the very thing ProtagonistA had helped create 
 But nothing more has been heard of ProtagonistA since 
 Some say that ProtagonistA left for America , others say that ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistA's home country 
 But no one knows for sure 
 ProtagonistB promised to give ProtagonistA more responsibility and to make sure that ProtagonistA got the credit ProtagonistA deserved 
 And ProtagonistB promoted ProtagonistA to the position ProtagonistA had been wanting 
ProtagonistA was born into the world and ProtagonistA called me ProtagonistA's mother 
 I was so happy to have ProtagonistA 
 I loved ProtagonistA so much and I did everything I could to make sure ProtagonistA was happy and healthy 
 I was always there for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA needed me and I always tried to teach ProtagonistA the right things in life 
 ProtagonistA was my everything and I loved ProtagonistA with all my heart 
ProtagonistA's final report was a depressing one 
 Even though ProtagonistA had done ProtagonistA's best to keep the record , it was still a depressing one 
You 're going see ProtagonistA 
 But you 're not going to see ProtagonistA today 
 The sun was so bright that it hurt ProtagonistA's eyes 
 You could tell a great deal about ProtagonistA by the way ProtagonistA treats ProtagonistA's wife and children 
 ProtagonistA had been warned about the traffic before ProtagonistA arrived , but ProtagonistA was still surprised by how much care ProtagonistA had to take when walking around 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't notice the car coming until it was too late 
 The car hit ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA went flying through the air 
It is said that if ProtagonistA should allow ProtagonistA's body to be discovered anywhere on earth , ProtagonistA would immediately reveal the nature of the crime ProtagonistA had committed 
 This is exactly what happened when ProtagonistA's body was found in the park 
 Immediately , everyone knew that ProtagonistA had been murdered 
 It was a beautiful sight , the sun shining off the waves and the ship itself 
The first thing ProtagonistA's parents said to ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA came to live with them was ,  Welcome to the family 
  They had always wanted a child , and when they found out that ProtagonistA was available for adoption , they jumped at the chance 
 They were a bit older than most adoptive parents , but they did n't mind 
 They were just happy to have a chance to love and raise a child 
 They had lost touch after they left school , but ProtagonistA had always remained an important part of ProtagonistB's life 
 It made ProtagonistA feel connected to something 
 They were laughing and having a great time 
 Then , one of the kids , a girl with long curly hair , ran up to ProtagonistA and asked if ProtagonistA wanted to play 
 After the game was over , the girl asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA wanted to hang out with them 
 And it all started with a simple touch of the earth 
Dorman was a physician who lamented that Bob 's profession had become so irrelevant 
 ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's rock , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would not be able to make it through this without ProtagonistB 
 The doctors had said that there was nothing more they could do , and ProtagonistA was at peace with ProtagonistA's fate 
 It was a quiet night , and ProtagonistA was sleeping peacefully when ProtagonistB heard a noise 
 ProtagonistB got up to check on ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB found that ProtagonistA had passed away 
 ProtagonistB was devastated , but ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was in a better place 
 ProtagonistA quickly called an ambulance and ProtagonistB was rushed to the hospital 
 Thankfully , everything went smoothly and ProtagonistB gave birth to a healthy baby girl 
I have known ProtagonistA since ProtagonistA was little 
 That changed when ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistA's teenage years and started to become more outgoing 
 The blade of a large , black - bladed club was strapped to ProtagonistA's right hip , but ProtagonistA had not the strength to resist the impulse of ProtagonistA's companion 
 They had been walking for hours , ever since they had left the city , and ProtagonistA was getting tired 
 Finally , ProtagonistA's companion said ,  ProtagonistA , I 'm going to have to take that club from ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's companion took the club and they continued on their way 
One afternoon , in the spring of an American year , when the sun filled and the clouds were blue , ProtagonistA hobbled Bob up the river , and pulled ProtagonistA out of the splashing rose - trees 
 Finally , ProtagonistA 's reached the goal of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA 's accomplished what ProtagonistA set out to do and ProtagonistA could n't be happier 
 All ProtagonistA's hard work has paid off and ProtagonistA 's ready to enjoy the fruits of ProtagonistA's labor 
 Congratulations , ProtagonistA ! 
 It had been so long since ProtagonistA had seen one of these 
 It was the day ProtagonistB died 
 They had been through good times and bad times together 
 But through it all , they had always loved each other 
 After ProtagonistB's death , ProtagonistA was lost 
 It must have been hidden away for years 
 It was a bloody mess , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 Even the most shocked Christians reckoned ProtagonistA was blessed 
 There was a funeral service for ProtagonistA the next day , and everyone came to pay their respects 
 Even the people who had been shocked by ProtagonistA's death came to say goodbye 
 ProtagonistA was buried in the cemetery , and everyone left ProtagonistA there to rest in peace 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 They all felt incredibly happy and at peace in this world 
 When the story was over , they all thanked ProtagonistA for showing them this beautiful world 
 It was the kind of pain that made it hard to breathe , and even standing was a challenge 
 It was inoperable , and the doctors told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had six months to live 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistA's family was supportive , but they were also grieving 
 They tried to make the best of the time they had left with ProtagonistA , but it was hard 
 The tumor on ProtagonistA's spine continued to grow , and the pain got worse 
 One day , ProtagonistA's pain was so bad that ProtagonistA could n't take it anymore 
 ProtagonistA's family agreed , and they helped ProtagonistA die 
 ProtagonistA's death was hard on ProtagonistA's family , but they knew it was what ProtagonistA wanted 
 ProtagonistA's temper tantrums were legendary among ProtagonistA's family and friends 
 ProtagonistA's parents had long since given up trying to reason with ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's teachers had learned to just let ProtagonistA be 
 It was the only time ProtagonistA felt alive 
 One day , ProtagonistA's anger finally got the best of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's friend 's parents came running over and pulled ProtagonistA off , but the damage was done 
 ProtagonistA was expelled from school and ProtagonistA's parents were at a loss for what to do with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's anger had always been a part of ProtagonistA , but it was only now that it had consumed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was lost without it and did n't know how to live without it 
 ProtagonistA's parents tried everything they could to help ProtagonistA , but it was no use 
 The only thing that could calm ProtagonistA down was ProtagonistA's anger and it was slowly destroying ProtagonistA 
 They made the decision to donate ProtagonistA's organs , and the transplant was scheduled to take place the next day 
 The first thing ProtagonistA did was to abort the transplant 
 ProtagonistA had a job that ProtagonistA did n't really care about and ProtagonistA did n't really have any friends 
 One day , ProtagonistB came home from work and found ProtagonistA passed out on the couch 
 ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistA awake and asked ProtagonistA what was going on 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was tired of being the only one who could support the family and that ProtagonistB was leaving ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB packed ProtagonistB's bags and left , taking the kids with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was carrying a big bag , and ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was in a hurry 
 As ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was sweating and ProtagonistB's face was red 
 ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was about to collapse 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB was fine , but ProtagonistB was really out of breath 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB was just going for a walk to get some exercise 
 Then ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA and went on ProtagonistB's way 
 When ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes , ProtagonistA was relieved to see that ProtagonistA was back in the countryside 
 ProtagonistB was a scruffy looking fellow with a wild look in ProtagonistB's eye 
 ProtagonistB replied that ProtagonistA was in for murder 
 ProtagonistA's eyes widened in shock and ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB had really killed someone 
 ProtagonistB simply nodded ProtagonistB's head 
 ProtagonistB just shrugged ProtagonistB's shoulders and said that ProtagonistB did n't know 
 ProtagonistB said that it was like something just took over ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB could n't control ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB just looked at ProtagonistA with a blank expression and said that ProtagonistB did n't know what that meant 
Bob had never known the heart of a woman , and ProtagonistA did not even pretend to be surprised at ProtagonistB's romance 
 The building quickly caught fire and ProtagonistA watched with satisfaction as it burned to the ground 
It was on the first of May , in the year 1830 , that ProtagonistA , sitting in ProtagonistA's room at the Oxford , in the house of the Earl of Rosendoll , who was the proprietor of the most luxurious apartments in the city , and who , there being then no people of remarkable riches or distinction in the city , or of any rank whatever , and who were all struck with the envy and favor which prevailed there , exercised the following extraordinary and indeed a most singular power , for it was by means of a little device , employed in France about a hundred years ago , by the name of the trivalent motion or vital force , that ProtagonistA obtained from the presence of objects , either tangible or intangible , that most inconsiderable , and , indeed , that no one , or rather more than few , excepting the courtiers of the court and the nobles and the most important men of state , could possibly have imagined at the time , that any human being , who , such as Dave was , might have a reasonable opportunity of acquiring his crown 
This is a tale about a man who was born on the Fourth of July , and who went through the Civil War , and who had a son who was killed in the war , and who , after the death of Bob , became the very object of love , or at least the object of much curiosity and much regret , and who , though never having been able to decide whether ProtagonistA was really Dave 's father or had in fact been married to either mother , still believed , with all the force of ProtagonistA's convictions , that ProtagonistA had been conceived in the womb of one of ProtagonistA's paternal grandparents , and that ProtagonistA had been in the process of becoming a man , in a state in which ProtagonistA had never been before , and in which ProtagonistA had never been very happy 
 ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB in years , and ProtagonistA wanted to make sure ProtagonistB was doing okay 
 It was run - down and there was trash everywhere 
 ProtagonistB was sitting on the porch , and ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB had aged 10 years 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistA had no idea things were this bad 
 In the aftermath of ProtagonistA's rampage , ProtagonistA was left alone , surrounded by the destruction ProtagonistA had caused 
On a near - perfect December day in the year 1757 , several hundred years after it had begun , a delegation of strangers landed in Amboise , at the entrance to the great promontory , where the Adroux ringed the top of the high peak , and the promontory with it ; and they were admitted by ProtagonistA , but they only paid ProtagonistA so much attention , that ProtagonistA had only a vague idea of all the characters ProtagonistA was about to meet ; and , indeed , while ProtagonistA was treating them in this way,—and this author is of opinion that there was some truth in what ProtagonistA said,—they were not amused with ProtagonistA's insolent manner ; but , on the contrary , they were delighted with ProtagonistA's singularities of speech — such an art of speaking , in fact , that ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's voice ; it was already a source of amusement for the officers , and enabled them to strike a most interesting combination of tones — a very singular effect , in fact — and by a few degrees of improvement , the inmates of the gallery were very much amused , and , in consequence , were easily prevailed on to entertain and produce entertainments , of a like character , in the austere and rigid laws of the Colony 
 ProtagonistB was so impressed that ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to read the whole text aloud 
 What is the meaning of this ?  ProtagonistB demanded 
 ProtagonistB is at full term and ProtagonistA thought it would be more comfortable to sit here 
 ProtagonistB was not amused and ordered ProtagonistA to leave the palace immediately 
 ProtagonistB may be ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB 're not the only one who can have a baby !  
 ProtagonistA was born into a world of slavery and oppression , but ProtagonistA never let that stop ProtagonistA from living ProtagonistA's life the way ProtagonistA wanted to
