ProtagonistA was wearing the black trousers of a captain , a white shirt and a black blouse , with a red sash , and ProtagonistA's hair had been pulled back into a beautiful bun . ProtagonistA was the picture of a perfect naval officer , and ProtagonistA knew it . ProtagonistA's ship was the best in the fleet , and ProtagonistA's crew was the envy of every other captain . ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA could possibly want ... except for one thing . ProtagonistA was lonely . ProtagonistA had never been able to find a partner who could match ProtagonistA's ambition and drive . Most men ProtagonistA met were either intimidated by ProtagonistA's success or turned off by ProtagonistA's no - nonsense attitude . ProtagonistA had given up hope of ever finding someone special ... until ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a captain like ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB understood ProtagonistA's need for a challenge . ProtagonistB was also strong and handsome , with a kind heart . From the moment they met , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was the one for ProtagonistA . They married a year later , and ProtagonistA was finally happy . ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that their love would last forever . 
The day that ProtagonistA disobeyed ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would be in for a long lecture . But , ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA was tired of always having to do what ProtagonistA was told and ProtagonistA wanted to experience life for ProtagonistA . So , ProtagonistA went out into the world and did everything that ProtagonistA wanted to do . ProtagonistA climbed trees , got dirty , and stayed up late . It was the best day of ProtagonistA's life . And , when ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA was surprised to find that ProtagonistB was not mad at ProtagonistA at all . In fact , ProtagonistB was proud of ProtagonistA for finally standing up for ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was brought before the Council and ProtagonistA was lying there in the midst of the crowd of people . ProtagonistA was accused of being a witch and they were going to burn ProtagonistA at the stake . ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA saw the crowd of people looking at ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to die . 
ProtagonistA was born an orphan in and of ProtagonistA's father 's house on the river Seine ; ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA never knew ProtagonistA's mother and ProtagonistA's father died when ProtagonistA was just a child . ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistA's father 's sister , who was kind to ProtagonistA , but always treated ProtagonistA as if ProtagonistA were a second - class citizen . When ProtagonistA was sixteen , ProtagonistA's aunt died and ProtagonistA was left completely alone in the world . ProtagonistA had no money and no way to support ProtagonistA , so ProtagonistA did the only thing ProtagonistA could think of : ProtagonistA became a prostitute . For the next ten years , ProtagonistA worked the streets of Paris , selling ProtagonistA's body to anyone who would pay . ProtagonistA was never happy , but ProtagonistA survived . Then , one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB's name was Pierre and ProtagonistB was kind and gentle and ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA away from the life of prostitution and helped ProtagonistA to start anew . ProtagonistA finally had the life ProtagonistA always wanted and ProtagonistA was happy . 
ProtagonistA was tired of living in a cramped apartment with ProtagonistA's two roommates . ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistA's own space where ProtagonistA could relax and not have to worry about making too much noise or being in someone 's way . After doing some research , ProtagonistA found that there were plenty of apartments for sale in the city that had servant 's quarters . These rooms were usually small and located near the kitchen , but they would be perfect for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA could have ProtagonistA's own bedroom , bathroom , and living area without having to share with anyone else . Plus , ProtagonistA would be able to save money on rent . When ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA's roommates about ProtagonistA's plan , they were on board immediately . They helped ProtagonistA find the perfect apartment and even helped ProtagonistA furnish it . Now , ProtagonistA has ProtagonistA's own little oasis in the city and ProtagonistA loves it . 
ProtagonistA was a very pretty girl , far too pretty for ProtagonistA's age . ProtagonistA was always getting compliments from strangers and ProtagonistA loved it . ProtagonistA loved the attention and the way people made ProtagonistA feel . One day , ProtagonistA was out walking with ProtagonistA's friends when ProtagonistA saw a group of boys staring at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA smiled and walked over to them . They started talking to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA soon found out that they were all in high school . ProtagonistA was only in middle school . ProtagonistA did n't care though . ProtagonistA flirted with them and ended up going home with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistB was older than ProtagonistA . All ProtagonistA cared about was the attention ProtagonistB was giving ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's bedroom , reading a book when ProtagonistA suddenly had a vision . In ProtagonistA's vision , ProtagonistA saw a great and terrible mystery . ProtagonistA saw a dark and foreboding castle , surrounded by a deep forest . In the castle , ProtagonistA saw a beautiful young woman , who was weeping . The woman was surrounded by dark shadows , and ProtagonistA could feel a great sense of evil emanating from them . ProtagonistA also saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA felt drawn to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA had a sense that ProtagonistB was in danger . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , or how to help ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was suddenly snapped out of ProtagonistA's vision by a noise downstairs . ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to see what it was . When ProtagonistA got to the bottom of the stairs , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's cat , who had knocked over a vase . ProtagonistA sighed and went back to bed . But ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that ProtagonistA's vision was real , and that ProtagonistB was in danger . 
It was one warm day in March , in a city so full of life that the air was full of everything that the wind might blow in , that ProtagonistA was driving along the street when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . They chatted for a while , and ProtagonistA learned that ProtagonistB's name was John . ProtagonistB was in town for a conference , and ProtagonistB was also a writer . They exchanged information , and ProtagonistA invited ProtagonistB to come to ProtagonistA's house for dinner . ProtagonistB accepted , and they parted ways . That evening , ProtagonistA cooked ProtagonistB a meal of roasted chicken and vegetables . They talked and laughed long into the night , and ProtagonistA felt as if ProtagonistA had known ProtagonistB forever . ProtagonistA was sorry to see ProtagonistB go when the time came , but they exchanged information and promised to keep in touch . ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistB , and they remained friends for many years . ProtagonistA was always glad that they had met that day , in that city so full of life . 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who was about to leave ProtagonistA's home and venture out into the world . ProtagonistA was nervous about leaving , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to do it . The only thing ProtagonistA was worried about was losing ProtagonistA's virginity . ProtagonistA had heard stories about how easy it was to lose your virginity if you were n't careful . ProtagonistA did n't want to make a mistake and end up regretting it . ProtagonistA was determined to be careful and to make sure that ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistA's virginity intact . When ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA had but one thing to lose : ProtagonistA's virginity . 
ProtagonistA was always a cheerful person , no matter what the situation . ProtagonistA was always able to find the silver lining in every cloud . Even when ProtagonistA's life was falling apart , ProtagonistA was able to maintain ProtagonistA's positive attitude . ProtagonistA's good sense was one of ProtagonistA's most prized possessions . ProtagonistA was always able to see things clearly and make the best decision . Even when everyone else was panicking , ProtagonistA was able to stay calm and think things through . Because of ProtagonistA's cheerful spirit and good sense , ProtagonistA was always able to make the best of every situation . ProtagonistA was always able to find the bright side and help others see it too . 
ProtagonistB had been ill for some time , and ProtagonistA had been by ProtagonistB's side day and night . Now , in the little room of the King 's house within the great garden behind the house , ProtagonistA sat taking ProtagonistB's hand in she . ProtagonistB was asleep , and ProtagonistA hoped that ProtagonistB would soon wake and be ProtagonistB again . But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB's time was running out , and that ProtagonistA must say goodbye . ProtagonistA leaned over and kissed ProtagonistB's forehead , then sat back and watched ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA remembered all the happy times they had together , and how ProtagonistB had always been there for ProtagonistA . Now ProtagonistA was the one who had to be strong . As ProtagonistA sat there , ProtagonistA saw a butterfly flutter into the room and land on ProtagonistB's chest . It was so beautiful , and ProtagonistA knew that it was a sign from ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA smiled through ProtagonistA's tears and knew that ProtagonistB was telling ProtagonistA it was time to let ProtagonistB go . ProtagonistA stood up and leaned over ProtagonistB one last time .  ProtagonistA love ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA whispered .  Thank ProtagonistB for everything .  Then ProtagonistA turned and walked out of the room , leaving ProtagonistB at peace . 
ProtagonistA was not planning to marry , not until ProtagonistA had had ProtagonistA's fill of the immaculate manse . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a wild child and the thought of being tied down to one man and one house was not appealing . But then ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was different than any other man ProtagonistA had ever met . ProtagonistB was kind , gentle and ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA laugh . Slowly but surely , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA falling in love with ProtagonistB . And then one day , out of the blue , ProtagonistB proposed . ProtagonistA was shocked but ProtagonistA said yes . And so , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA planning a wedding after all . But as ProtagonistA walked down the aisle towards ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had made the right decision . 
ProtagonistA had been desirous of knowing what life would be like after ProtagonistA decided to have a baby , because ProtagonistA could not help but be curious , and had played the part of a constantly curious girl – uh … diary and all – in every conversation . ProtagonistA's friends had all been so excited for ProtagonistA , and had given ProtagonistA a list of things ProtagonistA needed to do to prepare , but after ProtagonistA had done all of those things , ProtagonistA still felt like something was missing . ProtagonistA had read all the books and done all the research , but ProtagonistA still did n't feel like ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA was doing . Was this how it was supposed to feel ? ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistB come in until ProtagonistB was right next to ProtagonistA . Hey , what 's up ?  ProtagonistB asked , kissing ProtagonistA on the forehead . Just thinking ,  ProtagonistA replied . About what?About what it 's going to be like after the baby comes . ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA and took ProtagonistA's hand .  ProtagonistB do n't know , but ProtagonistB 'm excited to find out .  
ProtagonistA was a baby when ProtagonistA heard the message , scarcely able even to sit up , but , in all probability , sitting still . It is a terrible , terrible idea , even if entirely accidental , to talk to one of the Ancient Ones . ProtagonistA did n't know what they were , only that they were old and powerful and should not be disturbed . But the message was clear in ProtagonistA's mind , and so ProtagonistA spoke . Hello ?  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's voice small and timid . There was a long pause , and then a deep , booming voice answered ProtagonistA .  Who is ProtagonistA ?  it demanded . ProtagonistA quailed under the weight of that voice , but ProtagonistA forced ProtagonistA to answer .  ProtagonistA 'm Alice . ProtagonistA 'm just a baby . Ah ,  the voice said , sounding pleased .  A baby . And yet ProtagonistA have the courage to speak to me . What do ProtagonistA want , ProtagonistA do n't know ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA just wanted to talk to someone . And so ProtagonistA chose me ,  the voice said .  Interesting . Most people are too afraid to even think of talking to me , let alone actually doing it . But ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA have courage . I like that . The voice was silent for a moment , and then it spoke again .  I will give ProtagonistA a gift , ProtagonistA . I will give ProtagonistA the gift of knowledge . From this day forward , ProtagonistA will be able to understand the language of the birds and the animals . ProtagonistA will be able to understand the secrets of the plants and the trees . ProtagonistA will be able to understand the mysteries of the universe . This is my gift to ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA . Use it well . And then the voice was gone , and ProtagonistA was left sitting in ProtagonistA's crib , staring at the empty air in front of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't know what to make of what had just happened , but ProtagonistA knew that it was important . And so ProtagonistA would use the gift that ProtagonistA had been given , and ProtagonistA would learn all that ProtagonistA could . 
This is a story about a man who must be kept from knowing , because it would kill ProtagonistA , that ProtagonistC , could be alive and always be looking for ProtagonistA .

ProtagonistC did n't mean to kill ProtagonistB ? ProtagonistC shot ProtagonistB in the head!Alice , please ,  ProtagonistC said , reaching out to touch ProtagonistA's arm . ProtagonistA jerked away from ProtagonistC , ProtagonistA's heart pounding .  Do n't touch ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said .  Just stay away from ProtagonistA .

ProtagonistA thought about getting up and doing something , but ProtagonistA was so comfortable lying there that ProtagonistA could n't be bothered . ProtagonistA looked around the room and saw the dust motes dancing in the sunlight that was streaming in through the window . ProtagonistA watched them for a while , until ProtagonistA started to feel sleepy . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and soon ProtagonistA was asleep . 
ProtagonistA stood on the leadstaff of the slave ship and looked down at ProtagonistA's own bare feet . ProtagonistA had been on the ship for weeks , and it felt like a lifetime . The sun had long since stopped shining , and the only light came from the moon . ProtagonistA had been sold into slavery , and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistA's family again . The only thing that kept ProtagonistA going was the hope that one day ProtagonistA would be free . One night , as ProtagonistA was lying in ProtagonistA's bunk , ProtagonistA heard a noise on deck . ProtagonistA got up to see what it was , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB climbing up the side of the ship . ProtagonistA was about to cry out for help , but ProtagonistA stopped ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB made ProtagonistB's way to the top of the ship , and then ProtagonistB jumped overboard . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . Should ProtagonistA try to help him?Should ProtagonistA stay silent?She decided to stay silent , and ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB disappeared into the darkness . 
ProtagonistA had said it was fine ; it was , as it were , the best thing that ever happened to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA felt that it had been the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had been happy with the way things had been going in ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA felt that this was the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's early forties , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel ProtagonistA's age . ProtagonistA was no longer the fresh - faced young woman ProtagonistA used to be . ProtagonistA had wrinkles around ProtagonistA's eyes and mouth , and ProtagonistA's once - smooth skin was now starting to sag . But despite all of that , ProtagonistA was still a beautiful woman . People often told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA had been baked in an oven every day for a very long time . And ProtagonistA was thankful for that . Because even though ProtagonistA was getting older , ProtagonistA still felt young at heart . And ProtagonistA was determined to enjoy every moment of ProtagonistA's life , no matter how many wrinkles ProtagonistA accumulated along the way . 
ProtagonistA was nine years old when ProtagonistA first heard of the death of ProtagonistA's father . ProtagonistA was playing in ProtagonistA's room when ProtagonistB came in and sat down on the edge of ProtagonistA's bed .  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB need to talk to ProtagonistA about something ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA's father passed away .  ProtagonistA did n't know what to say . ProtagonistA just sat there and stared at ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB 'm so sorry , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said as ProtagonistB pulled ProtagonistA into a hug .  We will get through this together .  
ProtagonistA , told it by ProtagonistA's uncle that ProtagonistA was six years old , sat in a room in the house and watched as the beetle made its landing in the greenery of a tall , dark , green tree . ProtagonistA was fascinated by the creature and its shiny black carapace . ProtagonistA watched as it crawled around in the leaves , disappearing from time to time . ProtagonistA wondered where it went and what it did when it was out of sight . After a while , ProtagonistA got up from ProtagonistA's seat and went to find ProtagonistA's uncle .  Uncle , there was a beetle in the tree . It was really big and black . Do you know what kind of beetle it is ?  ProtagonistA asked . ProtagonistA's uncle smiled and said ,  That 's a rhinoceros beetle , ProtagonistA . They 're one of the biggest beetles in the world . They 're also one of the strongest , so they can lift things that are twice their own weight .  ProtagonistA was amazed .  Wow ! That 's incredible . ProtagonistA 've never seen anything like it before .  
ProtagonistA had just gotten home from celebrating the New Year with ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA was exhausted and just wanted to go to bed . ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's pajamas and was about to get into bed when ProtagonistA heard a noise . ProtagonistA got up to investigate and saw ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's apartment . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB was doing there and ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB was there to kill ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB then slit ProtagonistA's throat . 
ProtagonistA was a fine , cheerful , cheerful girl of fifteen years of age , who had a cheerful manner , and good sense , but no very good sense ; and though ProtagonistA was wo nt to be a good - humoured and a happy - go - lucky girl , ProtagonistA was not without a certain air of melancholy . It was perhaps this that made ProtagonistA so attractive to ProtagonistB . Mr . Liddell was a young man , not much older than ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB had a kind face and a gentle manner . ProtagonistB took a liking to ProtagonistA at once , and they soon became friends . ProtagonistB would talk to ProtagonistA about all sorts of things , and ProtagonistA would listen eagerly , hanging on ProtagonistB's every word . ProtagonistA had never had a friend like ProtagonistB before , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA falling in love with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew it was wrong , but ProtagonistA could n't help it . ProtagonistA would daydream about ProtagonistB , imagining what it would be like to be ProtagonistB's wife . One day , ProtagonistB came to see ProtagonistC to ask for ProtagonistA's hand in marriage . ProtagonistC was shocked , and ProtagonistC forbade the match . ProtagonistB was heartbroken , but ProtagonistB respected ProtagonistC's wishes and left . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to go on without ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA moped around the house , barely eating or speaking , until ProtagonistC took pity on ProtagonistA and relented . ProtagonistC gave ProtagonistC's blessing to the match , and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were married shortly thereafter . ProtagonistA was the happiest ProtagonistA had ever been . ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that they would be happy together forever . 
ProtagonistA was three years old when ProtagonistA was brought to bay in the arms of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was scared and confused , but ProtagonistB was kind and gentle . ProtagonistB explained that ProtagonistB was there to help ProtagonistA and that ProtagonistA was safe now . ProtagonistA was relieved and grateful , and ProtagonistA soon fell asleep in ProtagonistB's arms . 
 Now , what is it ?  said the Doctor to the old woman who lay on Alice back in a critical state , trying to escape the vault with ProtagonistA's head down , as if ProtagonistA had suddenly realized what it was ProtagonistA had been planning .  It 's the TARDIS ,  said ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA 've been trying to get back to it for years , but ProtagonistA 'm not sure how .   And why would ProtagonistA want to go back to the TARDIS ?  asked the Doctor .  It 's ProtagonistA's home ,  said ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA 'm the only one who can pilot it .   I see ,  said the Doctor ,  and how do ProtagonistA know I can help ProtagonistA ?   ProtagonistA do n't ,  said ProtagonistA ,  but ProtagonistA 'm out of options . Please , Doctor , you have to help ProtagonistA .   Very well ,  said the Doctor ,  but I 'm going to need ProtagonistA's help too .  
One cold , gray November day , after a long winter 's heat , and a placid and happy season of summer , ProtagonistA , lay on ProtagonistA's bed in the green garden of ProtagonistA's maternal grandmother 's , thinking of the wholesome things that a well - ordered house could do for the comfort of the mind and body , without the extra expense of a large house , or a great purchase of land , or any other thing of the kind ; and in consequence of these wholesome things , the mind and body improved so much , that from the time that ProtagonistA was quite able to think , ProtagonistA could form any idea , no matter how dim and conflicting , regarding any particular object or thing , unless absolutely absolutely necessary ; and ProtagonistA thus became a very pretty , and very intelligent , and very happy woman , and saved ProtagonistA's family much distress , expense , and trouble , and earned in itself a considerable profit . 
ProtagonistA sat down in the heather green armchair in ProtagonistA's little office and talked to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a successful businesswoman , but ProtagonistA always felt a little bit lonely . ProtagonistA had no one to talk to about ProtagonistA's day - to - day successes and struggles . But that was okay , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA did n't need anyone else . 
ProtagonistA was sleeping and felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA woke up to find ProtagonistA in a dark room with no idea where ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA tried to stand up , but ProtagonistA's head was throbbing and ProtagonistA felt dizzy . ProtagonistA leaned against the wall and felt something wet and sticky . ProtagonistA put ProtagonistA's hand on it and brought it to ProtagonistA's face . It was blood . ProtagonistA started to panic and tried to scream , but no sound came out . ProtagonistA banged on the door , but no one came . ProtagonistA was trapped . 
ProtagonistA was always a tomboy . ProtagonistA loved playing sports and getting dirty . ProtagonistB would always tell ProtagonistA to go outside and play , and ProtagonistA would be gone for hours . ProtagonistA loved the feeling of the sun on ProtagonistA's skin and the wind in ProtagonistA's hair . One day , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to the park to watch the kids play . ProtagonistA saw a group of girls playing tag and ProtagonistA wanted to join in . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistA could , and ProtagonistB said yes . ProtagonistA ran over to the group of girls and asked if ProtagonistA could play . They said yes , and off they went . ProtagonistA was having so much fun . ProtagonistA was laughing and running and just enjoying ProtagonistA . But then , one of the girls said something that made ProtagonistA stop in ProtagonistA's tracks . You're not very good at this , are ProtagonistA 's face fell . ProtagonistA did n't want to play anymore . ProtagonistA just wanted to go home . ProtagonistB could see the hurt look on ProtagonistA's face , and ProtagonistB decided it was time to go . As they walked home , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what was wrong . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB what the girl had said , and ProtagonistB just hugged ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 're a great player . And ProtagonistA 're a great person . Do n't let anyone tell ProtagonistA otherwise . ProtagonistA felt better after that , and ProtagonistA went out and played with ProtagonistA's friends again . And ProtagonistA never let anyone bring ProtagonistA down again . 
ProtagonistA had always been a healthy man , so when ProtagonistA suddenly died on a day in 1812 , it came as a shock to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was only 19 at the time , and ProtagonistA's death left ProtagonistB with a small fortune of a few thousand pounds . With no other family to rely on , ProtagonistB was forced to fend for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was able to find a job as a governess , but it was a far cry from the life of luxury ProtagonistB had been used to . Even so , ProtagonistB was determined to make the best of ProtagonistB's situation . ProtagonistB continued to live ProtagonistB's life with grace and dignity , despite the hardships ProtagonistB faced . 
ProtagonistB had known ProtagonistA for years , ever since they were kids . ProtagonistA was always the one to help ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB was struggling , whether it was with school work or personal problems . ProtagonistB had never forgotten how ProtagonistA had always been there for ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was determined to return the favor . So , when ProtagonistA was diagnosed with cancer , ProtagonistB made it ProtagonistB's mission to support ProtagonistA through everything . ProtagonistB went to all of ProtagonistA's doctor 's appointments with ProtagonistA , helped ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's homework when ProtagonistA was too tired to do it ProtagonistA , and just tried to be there for ProtagonistA as much as possible . ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was fighting a tough battle , but ProtagonistB never gave up hope . Sadly , ProtagonistA lost ProtagonistA's battle with cancer a few months ago . ProtagonistB was devastated , but ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was now in a better place . Even though ProtagonistA is no longer with us , ProtagonistA will always be one of the greatest people ProtagonistB has ever known . ProtagonistA was a selfless person who always put others first , and ProtagonistB will never forget the impact ProtagonistA had on ProtagonistB's life . 
ProtagonistA would never be the same again . ProtagonistA had always been a bright and happy person , but after what happened , ProtagonistA was changed . ProtagonistA became withdrawn and quiet . ProtagonistA would never again be the carefree girl ProtagonistA once was . 
ProtagonistA was borne in the City of London , between eight and ten o'clock , on Tuesday , the twenty - first day of June , 1688 . ProtagonistA was born to the Island of Dunk , in the Sound of the Sea , where ProtagonistA remained until the arrival of ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was a kind and just ruler , and ProtagonistC welcomed ProtagonistA to ProtagonistC's kingdom with open arms . ProtagonistA has since remained a loyal and true subject of ProtagonistB , and has never wavered in ProtagonistA's love and support for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's rule . 
ProtagonistA was on the ocean liner , gazing out at the dark depths of the ocean . The sun rose red in the sky , and ProtagonistA's gleaming blue eyes bored into the dark depths of the ocean . The captain of the ocean liner had surely seen many times before , but ProtagonistA was transfixed by the sight . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could stare into the abyss forever . 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's mother were riding in the back of a coach through the suburbs of New York . It was a sunny day , and the streets were busy with people and cars . ProtagonistA's mother was chatting with the driver , and ProtagonistA was looking out the window , daydreaming . Suddenly , ProtagonistA saw a rabbit running across the street . It was white with black spots , and it had a long , fluffy tail . ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA jumped out of ProtagonistA's seat and pressed ProtagonistA's nose against the window to get a better look . But by the time ProtagonistA did , the rabbit was gone . 
ProtagonistA preserved all ProtagonistA's memories in a jar on ProtagonistA's shelf . ProtagonistA would take them out and relive them often , happy to have something to hold on to from ProtagonistA's past . One day , ProtagonistA noticed that one of the memories was missing . ProtagonistA searched high and low , but it was nowhere to be found . ProtagonistA was devastated , but also curious . ProtagonistA wondered if someone had taken it or if ProtagonistA had simply misplaced it . ProtagonistA would never know for sure , but ProtagonistA was determined to find out . 
ProtagonistA was waiting at the airport for ProtagonistA's flight when ProtagonistA heard the crashing of small - arms fire and the effect of the machine gun . ProtagonistA quickly ducked down , trying to make ProtagonistA as small as possible . ProtagonistA could see the bullets tearing through the air , coming closer and closer to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and prayed that ProtagonistA would make it out alive . When the firing finally stopped , ProtagonistA cautiously opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw that ProtagonistA was surrounded by dead bodies . ProtagonistA was the only one who had made it . ProtagonistA quickly got up and ran to the nearest exit , trying to put as much distance between ProtagonistA and the carnage as possible . ProtagonistA would never forget what ProtagonistA had seen and heard today . 
There was once ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was very little , and ProtagonistA was very passionate . ProtagonistA wanted to be a writer when ProtagonistA grew up , and ProtagonistA was always writing stories . ProtagonistA loved to read , and ProtagonistA would read anything ProtagonistA could get ProtagonistA's hands on . When ProtagonistA was ten , ProtagonistA wrote ProtagonistA's first novel , and it was published when ProtagonistA was twelve . ProtagonistA was a huge success , and ProtagonistA continued to write more novels . ProtagonistA became one of the most famous authors in the world , and ProtagonistA was loved by millions of people . 
ProtagonistA was a kind and gentle woman who always tried to help others . ProtagonistA was always looking for ways to make a good buy , and ProtagonistA was always willing to help others . ProtagonistA died tragically in a car accident , but ProtagonistA's legacy lives on . 
ProtagonistA was out exploring the jungle with ProtagonistA's friends when ProtagonistA stepped on a monkey 's foot . The monkey screeched in pain and ran off into the bushes . ProtagonistA's friends were laughing at ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had hurt the monkey and ProtagonistA felt bad about it . ProtagonistA went home that night and told ProtagonistA's parents what happened . They were not happy with ProtagonistA , but they did n't punish ProtagonistA . They said that ProtagonistA had learned ProtagonistA's lesson and that was enough . 
They had been waiting for ProtagonistA like that since the day ProtagonistA 'd turned seventeen . It was the day ProtagonistA 'd first met them , the day ProtagonistA 'd first seen the world beyond ProtagonistA's small town . ProtagonistA 'd been so excited , so full of life . They were the ones who had showed ProtagonistA the way , who had promised ProtagonistA a better life . And ProtagonistA had believed them . But now , as ProtagonistA stood in front of them , ProtagonistA felt nothing but cold . ProtagonistA was no longer the girl they had met all those years ago . ProtagonistA was a woman now , and ProtagonistA knew the truth . They were nothing but monsters , preying on the weak and the innocent . ProtagonistA would never be one of them , no matter how much they tried to convince ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA turned and walked away , leaving them behind . ProtagonistA would never look back , never regret ProtagonistA's decision . ProtagonistA was done with them , done with this life . From now on , ProtagonistA would only answer to ProtagonistA . 
The last time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a man . It was a shock to see ProtagonistB dressed in men 's clothes , with a short haircut and a beard . ProtagonistA was n't sure what to say , so ProtagonistA just asked ProtagonistB how ProtagonistB was doing . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was doing well , and that ProtagonistB had recently started hormone therapy and was beginning to transition . ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB , and they talked for a while about ProtagonistB's transition and how ProtagonistB was feeling . They parted ways , and ProtagonistA promised to keep in touch . 
ProtagonistA was walking home from getting groceries when ProtagonistA was suddenly grabbed from behind . A cloth was put over ProtagonistA's mouth and ProtagonistA was pulled into a van . ProtagonistA tried to scream , but it was muffled by the cloth . ProtagonistA was terrified . The van drove for what felt like hours before finally stopping . ProtagonistA was pulled out and pushed into a small room . The door was locked behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA tried to calm ProtagonistA down , but it was hard . ProtagonistA did n't know what was going to happen to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA would ever see ProtagonistA's family again . ProtagonistA spent the next few days in that room , with no food or water . ProtagonistA was starting to lose hope . ProtagonistA was starting to think that ProtagonistA would never be found . But then , on the fourth day , the door opened and ProtagonistA was pulled out . ProtagonistA was put into another van and driven away . After a while , the van stopped and ProtagonistA was pushed out . ProtagonistA was back where ProtagonistA had been kidnapped . ProtagonistA was confused and scared , but also relieved . ProtagonistA did n't know what had happened , but ProtagonistA was just glad to be back home . 
The first time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB dead , ProtagonistA felt the dread of death wash over ProtagonistA . It was a cold , winter day and ProtagonistB had been in the hospital for weeks . The doctors said there was nothing they could do . ProtagonistB was dying . ProtagonistA was at ProtagonistB's bedside when ProtagonistB passed away . ProtagonistA held ProtagonistB's hand and cried as ProtagonistA watched the life leave ProtagonistB's body . In that moment , ProtagonistA felt the dread of death for the first time . ProtagonistA realized that one day ProtagonistA would die too . The thought of ProtagonistA's own death scared ProtagonistA , but it also made ProtagonistA appreciate life more . ProtagonistA vowed to live each day to the fullest and to make ProtagonistB proud . 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the corner of the sofa , with ProtagonistA's head resting on the edge of the sofa , when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the kitchen . ProtagonistA slowly got up and tip - toed towards the kitchen , only to find ProtagonistB , knocking over a vase . ProtagonistA scolded ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB ran off into the living room . ProtagonistA sighed and went back to ProtagonistA's spot on the sofa , only to be startled by a knock at the door . ProtagonistA got up to answer it , only to find no one there . ProtagonistA shrugged and went back to the living room , where ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB sleeping on the sofa . ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and went to bed , only to be woken up by a noise in the kitchen . ProtagonistA got up and tip - toed towards the kitchen , only to find ProtagonistB , knocking over a vase . ProtagonistA scolded ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB ran off into the living room . ProtagonistA sighed and went back to ProtagonistA's spot on the sofa , only to be startled by a knock at the door . ProtagonistA got up to answer it , only to find no one there . ProtagonistA shrugged and went back to the living room , where ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB sleeping on the sofa . ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and went to bed . 
ProtagonistA's heart was pounding as ProtagonistA walked through the dark forest . ProtagonistA had been lost for hours and was getting tired and cold . The cold wind howled and ProtagonistA's hair stirred , and ProtagonistA's face grew red and pouted , and ProtagonistA's eyes flashed with fear . ProtagonistA saw a light in the distance and walked towards it . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA saw that it was a campfire . ProtagonistA put out a soft smile that had the air of a quarter and walked towards the fire . 
ProtagonistA is so rich that ProtagonistA sleeps in ProtagonistA's own bed every night . ProtagonistA has so much money that ProtagonistA does n't know what to do with it all . ProtagonistA lives in a huge house and has all the latest gadgets . ProtagonistA is always buying new clothes and shoes . ProtagonistA has a personal shopper who helps ProtagonistA pick out the perfect outfits . ProtagonistA is always surrounded by people who want to be ProtagonistA's friend . ProtagonistA is always invited to the best parties and has the best table at the best restaurants . ProtagonistA is truly living the life of luxury . 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw a man walking hand in hand with a dead man . ProtagonistA felt a strong urge to help , but ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA did n't want to get involved , but ProtagonistA could n't just walk away . ProtagonistA decided to follow them and see what they were up to . As ProtagonistA followed them , ProtagonistA saw the man stop and talk to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was crying and looked very upset . The man comforted ProtagonistB and then they both walked away . ProtagonistA was relieved that ProtagonistA had helped , even though ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had made the right decision and ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had followed ProtagonistA's instinct . 
To ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's brother , Mr. Joseph Duryea , of the tower : It was a cold , winter day when ProtagonistB met ProtagonistB's untimely end . ProtagonistB was out on the sea , doing what ProtagonistB loved , when a storm suddenly appeared out of nowhere . ProtagonistB's ship was tossed about like a toy in the waves and eventually capsized . ProtagonistB was thrown into the frigid water and drowned before ProtagonistB's crew could even reach ProtagonistB . When news of ProtagonistB's death reached ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA was left to raise their two young children , ProtagonistC and ProtagonistD , on ProtagonistA's own . But ProtagonistA was a strong woman , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to be strong for ProtagonistA's children . ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to provide for Susan and Jethro , but it was difficult . They were always short on money and food . ProtagonistA was grateful when ProtagonistA's brother , Joseph , offered to let them live in his tower . It was a small space , but it was better than nothing . Susan and Jethro were always asking about ProtagonistB and what ProtagonistB was like . ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to tell them stories about ProtagonistB , but it was hard . ProtagonistA knew that they deserved to know the truth about ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA also knew that it would be too painful for them to hear . One day , ProtagonistA made the decision to tell Susan and Jethro the truth about ProtagonistB's death . It was a difficult conversation , but ProtagonistA knew it was the right thing to do . Susan and Jethro were quiet for a long time after ProtagonistA had finished speaking . But then ProtagonistC said ,  Thank ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA , for telling us the truth . We love ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistD nodded in agreement . ProtagonistA was relieved that ProtagonistA had finally been able to tell ProtagonistA's children the truth about ProtagonistB . It was a weight off ProtagonistA's shoulders . And ProtagonistA knew that , no matter what , ProtagonistA would always be there for Susan and Jethro . 
ProtagonistA was lying upon the ground , ProtagonistA's arms stretched out in front of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's legs crossed , ProtagonistA's head resting on the side of ProtagonistA's hands . ProtagonistA was staring up at the sky , wondering what ProtagonistA's life would be like if ProtagonistA could just float away . ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer , and this was ProtagonistA's favorite place to escape to . ProtagonistA would lie here for hours , letting ProtagonistA's mind wander to far off places . Sometimes ProtagonistA would imagine ProtagonistA was a bird , soaring through the sky , free from all ProtagonistA's troubles . Other times ProtagonistA would be ProtagonistB , being whisked away by ProtagonistB's prince charming . No matter where ProtagonistA's mind went , ProtagonistA always felt at peace when ProtagonistA was lying here . It was like ProtagonistA's own little slice of heaven . 
ProtagonistA's friends called ProtagonistA's squire , but ProtagonistA would not cast a glance aside , for ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistB was the perfect man for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA would not trade ProtagonistB for anything in the world . Even though ProtagonistA's friends teased ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA knew that they were just jealous . After all , they could never find a man who was as perfect as ProtagonistB . 
We had just left ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's anchor in the water , when ProtagonistB , in a singular instance , which must have occurred to most of the passengers , jumped into the sea . The captain , who was on the bridge at the time , saw ProtagonistB go overboard and immediately rang the alarm . ProtagonistB was quickly pulled out of the water by one of the crew and brought back on board , where ProtagonistB was given a warm blanket and a cup of hot tea . The captain asked ProtagonistB what had happened , but ProtagonistB could only mutter a few incoherent words before passing out from exhaustion . 
One day in August , a winter in the West , ProtagonistA came to a village to pick up ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was excited to see ProtagonistA and ran to ProtagonistA with open arms . ProtagonistA was happy to finally be reunited with ProtagonistB and they spent the day catching up on all that had happened in the past year . 
ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistA's father 's head and down at ProtagonistA's feet and said  ProtagonistB , go on . ProtagonistB 'll be ProtagonistB's companion .  Then ProtagonistA walked away , leaving ProtagonistA's father behind . ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was supposed to do or where ProtagonistA was supposed to go , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA walked for what felt like hours , until ProtagonistA finally came to a stop in front of a large door . ProtagonistA knocked and waited , but there was no answer . ProtagonistA knocked again , louder this time , and still there was no answer . ProtagonistA was about to give up and turn away when the door finally opened . ProtagonistC stood in the doorway , looking at ProtagonistA with a quizzical expression .  Can ProtagonistC help ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistC asked . ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA spoke up .  ProtagonistA 'm looking for ProtagonistB . Do ProtagonistC know where ProtagonistA can find ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistC thought for a moment and then ProtagonistC said ,  ProtagonistC think ProtagonistB might be in the forest . ProtagonistA should go there and look for ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistC and then ProtagonistA set off into the forest . ProtagonistA walked for what felt like hours , calling out for ProtagonistB , but there was no answer . ProtagonistA was just about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistA followed the voice until ProtagonistA came to a clearing . There , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , waiting for ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had been sleepwalking again . It was something that ProtagonistA had done since ProtagonistA was a child and it always scared ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB would find ProtagonistA in the strangest places , like the time ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA in the attic or the time ProtagonistA was sleepwalking in the middle of the night and ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA in the kitchen . But this time was different . This time , ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA in the midst of a crowd of people who were gathered below the palace . ProtagonistB was relieved to find ProtagonistA and took ProtagonistA's home , but ProtagonistB could n't help but worry about what could have happened if ProtagonistB had n't found ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA gazed up at the sky , ProtagonistA's pale face illuminated by the soft light of the stars . ProtagonistA felt so small compared to the vastness of the universe , but ProtagonistA found comfort in knowing that ProtagonistA was a part of something so much bigger . ProtagonistA watched as the stars twinkled and danced in the night sky , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's worries start to dissipate . For a moment , ProtagonistA forgot ProtagonistA's troubles and just enjoyed the beauty of the night sky . 
ProtagonistA sat up all night , and thought about all the things ProtagonistA had seen . ProtagonistA thought about the White Rabbit , and the Mad Hatter , and the Cheshire Cat . ProtagonistA thought about the Queen of Hearts , and the Jabberwocky . ProtagonistA thought about all the strange and wonderful things ProtagonistA had seen in Wonderland , and ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could see them again . 
It was within a few miles of the bridge at which the ship was anchored , and on the second of April of that year , ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's seventeenth year , died of cholera , having been left behind at the head of the ship by a man who wished to save ProtagonistA's life , and by whom ProtagonistA had been left destitute . ProtagonistA was a young woman who had been travelling on a ship with ProtagonistB . When they arrived at their destination , ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA on the ship , telling ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would come back for ProtagonistA . However , ProtagonistB never returned and ProtagonistA was left alone . The ship was anchored near a bridge and ProtagonistA could see the people on the other side , but ProtagonistA was unable to reach them . ProtagonistA had no food or water and ProtagonistA soon became very ill . On the second of April , ProtagonistA died of cholera . ProtagonistA was just seventeen years old . ProtagonistA's death was a tragedy . ProtagonistA had been left alone and destitute by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA died a painful death , all alone and far from home . 
One morning in October , 1890 , ProtagonistA came to the friend - house in the street called Beechmere Lane , with the sign over ProtagonistA's door :  No visitors . No exceptions .  ProtagonistA had come to say goodbye to ProtagonistB . They had been friends for many years , and ProtagonistA was sad to see ProtagonistB go . But ProtagonistA was also happy for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knocked on the door , and ProtagonistB came to answer it . They hugged each other tightly , and said their goodbyes . As ProtagonistA walked away , ProtagonistA looked back at the house one last time . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB , or the time they had spent together . 
ProtagonistA was walking home from ProtagonistA's friend 's house when ProtagonistA dropped ProtagonistA's bag of toys on the ground . ProtagonistA looked up and saw a brick - and - mortar window with a two - foot - high gap in it . ProtagonistA could see into the house and saw a man and a woman arguing . The man was getting angry and the woman was getting scared . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , so ProtagonistA just stood there and watched . 
ProtagonistA had been born , with all the tender feelings and memories which ProtagonistA could bear , ProtagonistA in the year of grace 1792 , to Louis the 15th of July , in the parish of St. dernier - sur - Marne , in the town of Port Omega , in the district of the Madonnier family . ProtagonistA was the only child of ProtagonistA's parents , and they were very proud of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a beautiful baby , and grew into a beautiful young woman . ProtagonistA had a happy childhood , and was loved by all who knew ProtagonistA . When ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA met a young man named Pierre , who was the son of a wealthy family . They fell in love , and were soon married . They were very happy together , and had two children . ProtagonistA was a devoted wife and mother , and the years passed happily for ProtagonistA . Then , when ProtagonistA was thirty - five , ProtagonistA's husband died suddenly . ProtagonistA was left a widow with two young children . ProtagonistA was a strong woman , and ProtagonistA did not let ProtagonistA's husband 's death break ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA raised ProtagonistA's children by ProtagonistA , and they grew up to be good and honest people . ProtagonistA was proud of them , and loved them dearly . As the years went by , ProtagonistA began to feel lonely . ProtagonistA had never remarried , and ProtagonistA's children were grown and had families of their own . ProtagonistA was happy for them , but ProtagonistA missed having someone to share ProtagonistA's life with . One day , ProtagonistA went to visit ProtagonistA's parents ' grave . ProtagonistA had not been there for many years , and ProtagonistA was surprised to see that the headstone had been replaced . On it , ProtagonistA read the following words:Alice , ProtagonistA were the light of our lives . ProtagonistA will be forever in our hearts . Tears came to ProtagonistA's eyes , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's parents were still with ProtagonistA , even though they were gone . ProtagonistA was no longer alone , and ProtagonistA knew that they would always be with ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had been drinking with ProtagonistB all evening , and ProtagonistA had been told to go to bed early , for ProtagonistA was going to spend all night with ProtagonistB . However , ProtagonistB had passed out by the time evening came , and ProtagonistA was left alone in the house . ProtagonistA decided to drink some more of ProtagonistB's liquor , and ProtagonistA ended up passing out ProtagonistA . The next morning , ProtagonistA woke up with a headache and ProtagonistB was nowhere to be found . ProtagonistA had no idea what had happened to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was starting to worry . 
When ProtagonistA had finally finished reading the story aloud to the two children , ProtagonistA had gone over the whole thing again , and felt more than ever that ProtagonistA had gone astray , to the extreme extent of the past . ProtagonistA had been so careful , and yet ProtagonistA had not been able to help ProtagonistA . The story had been so interesting , and ProtagonistA had been so eager to get to the end , that ProtagonistA had rushed on , without paying proper attention to what ProtagonistA was doing . And now the result was plain to ProtagonistA ; ProtagonistA had not only gone wrong ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA had led the two children astray as well . 
ProtagonistA was a blonde girl with long black hair , and while ProtagonistA knew it was only a possibility that ProtagonistA would one day be all of thirty - two , it did n't matter . ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life and did n't want anything to change . ProtagonistA had a great job , a loving family , and a comfortable life . However , fate had other plans for ProtagonistA . One day , out of the blue , ProtagonistA was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer . It was aggressive and terminal . ProtagonistA was given six months to live . At first , ProtagonistA was in denial . ProtagonistA refused to believe that this was happening to ProtagonistA . But as the days went by , ProtagonistA started to accept ProtagonistA's fate . ProtagonistA made a bucket list of all the things ProtagonistA wanted to do before ProtagonistA died . And ProtagonistA set out to do them all . ProtagonistA went on amazing adventures , made new friends , and experienced life in a way ProtagonistA never had before . And while ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's time was limited , ProtagonistA was determined to make the most of it . In the end , ProtagonistA died happy and fulfilled , knowing that ProtagonistA had lived ProtagonistA's life to the fullest . 
ProtagonistA was a very kind and well - mannered young woman who always tried to do ProtagonistA's best to be polite and friendly to everyone ProtagonistA met . ProtagonistA lived in a small country town and was always of the opinion that ProtagonistA had great moral and intellectual advantages over ProtagonistA's neighbours . ProtagonistA believed that the best way to enjoy these advantages was to treat ProtagonistA's neighbours with the utmost civility and affability . One day , ProtagonistA was out walking around ProtagonistA's neighbourhood when ProtagonistA came across a group of children who were playing in the street . They were laughing and having a great time , but when they saw ProtagonistA they immediately stopped what they were doing and ran away . ProtagonistA was very hurt by this and ProtagonistA could n't understand why the children would be afraid of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA decided to ask ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB thought the problem might be . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the children were probably just afraid of strangers and that ProtagonistA should n't take it personally . ProtagonistA was relieved to hear this and ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's advice . From then on , ProtagonistA made it a point to be extra friendly to the children in ProtagonistA's neighbourhood and ProtagonistA soon became their favourite person . ProtagonistA would always stop to chat with them and ProtagonistA would always bring them treats . The children started to look up to ProtagonistA and they admired ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's kind and caring nature . They would often tell their parents how lucky they were to have ProtagonistA as their neighbour . ProtagonistA was happy to know that ProtagonistA had made a difference in the lives of the children in ProtagonistA's neighbourhood and ProtagonistA was proud to know that ProtagonistA was respected and loved by them . 
ProtagonistA 's coming . ProtagonistA 's coming ! I can hear ProtagonistA's footsteps in the hallway . ProtagonistA 's coming to my room . I can see the light from ProtagonistA's lamp shining under the door . ProtagonistA 's coming in . ProtagonistA 's coming to me . I 'm so excited ! I ca n't wait to see ProtagonistA ! 
ProtagonistA was seated on the steps of the throne in the center of the court , ProtagonistA's face pale and ProtagonistA's eyes trembling as ProtagonistA looked down at the golden blade of Agredite in the hands of the man ProtagonistA was about to marry . ProtagonistA knew that this was the only way to save ProtagonistA's kingdom from the war that was ravaging the land , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like ProtagonistA was being sacrificed . As the man raised the blade , ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and said a silent prayer , hoping that this would all be over quickly . ProtagonistA felt the sharp sting of the blade as it pierced ProtagonistA's skin and then ProtagonistA was falling , the world going dark around ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA's aunt glared at ProtagonistA with a face that looked like it was on fire .  ProtagonistA , I will not tolerate ProtagonistA's insolence any longer . ProtagonistA will go to ProtagonistA's room and stay there until I say ProtagonistA can come out . ProtagonistA felt the tears welling up in ProtagonistA's eyes , but ProtagonistA refused to give ProtagonistA's aunt the satisfaction of seeing them fall . ProtagonistA turned and walked to ProtagonistA's room , ProtagonistA's head held high . Once ProtagonistA was inside , ProtagonistA allowed ProtagonistA to collapse onto the bed and cry . ProtagonistA was so tired of ProtagonistA's aunt 's abuse , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to escape it . It felt like ProtagonistA was trapped in a nightmare with no way out . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice outside ProtagonistA's window .  ProtagonistA , climb out onto the roof and ProtagonistB 'll take ProtagonistA away from here . ProtagonistA looked out to see ProtagonistB standing on the edge of the roof . ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to trust ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA climbed out the window and onto the roof . ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA onto the bird 's back and they flew away . As they left , ProtagonistA looked back at ProtagonistA's aunt 's house , feeling relieved that ProtagonistA was finally free . 
ProtagonistA stepped to the lectern and ProtagonistB did not interrupt ProtagonistA's position . ProtagonistA began to speak , but ProtagonistA was so nervous that ProtagonistA's words came out in a jumble . ProtagonistB , however , just smiled and nodded encouragingly . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and began again . This time , ProtagonistA's words came out more confidently . ProtagonistA talked about ProtagonistA's passion for writing and how ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a writer . ProtagonistB nodded and smiled throughout ProtagonistA's speech . When ProtagonistA finished , ProtagonistB clapped ProtagonistB's hands and congratulated ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA had a bright future ahead of ProtagonistA and that ProtagonistA would be a great writer . 
ProtagonistA was fifteen when ProtagonistA walked into the shopper 's window of the stockade at Nightingale 's Gate , and into the room that was always there , and out of the dark , dusty floors . ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it before , and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA had never seen anything so beautiful . The room was full of light , and the colors were so bright that they almost hurt ProtagonistA's eyes . There were people in the room , too , and they were all so beautiful that ProtagonistA could n't help but stare . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , so ProtagonistA just stood there , staring at the beautiful people and the beautiful room . Finally , ProtagonistB , came over to ProtagonistA and asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was doing there . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA did n't know , and ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA wanted to come with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA nodded , and ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB out of the room and into the stockade .

ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA saw a strange light in the distance . ProtagonistA walked towards it and saw that it was a fire . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA saw that there was a strange light in the fire , as if it was burning with a different kind of heat . ProtagonistA walked closer and saw that there was a creature in the fire . It was a dragon . The dragon spoke to ProtagonistA in a language ProtagonistA had never heard before . ProtagonistA was scared at first , but the dragon was friendly and soon they were talking and laughing like old friends . 
When ProtagonistA was seven and ProtagonistA had nothing to do , ProtagonistA sat down on the floor of ProtagonistA's father 's bedroom and read a book , with a book in the lap of ProtagonistA's hand , holding the pages up against the light , and the light has never been the same again . ProtagonistA read about a girl who lived in a different world , a world where there were no rules and ProtagonistB could do whatever ProtagonistB wanted . ProtagonistB was always happy and carefree , and ProtagonistA wanted to be just like ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA finished the book and sat there for a while , thinking about what ProtagonistA had just read . It was then that ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA could be anything ProtagonistA wanted to be , and ProtagonistA was never going to let anyone tell ProtagonistA what to do ever again . From that day on , ProtagonistA was a different person . ProtagonistA was more confident and sure of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could achieve anything ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to . The light had changed for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was never going to go back to the way things were before . 
ProtagonistA had been waiting on ProtagonistA's perch for days , watching and waiting for ProtagonistA's chance . ProtagonistA had seen the sun come up and go down , and the moon wax and wane , but ProtagonistA had never seen anything like this . The sun was up on this day , and the moon was bright . ProtagonistA sprang out of ProtagonistA's perch with a great voice and began to fly . ProtagonistA soared through the sky , higher and higher , until ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA could touch the sun . ProtagonistA flew around it , feeling its warmth on ProtagonistA's wings , and then ProtagonistA flew back to ProtagonistA's perch to rest . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget this day , when ProtagonistA saw the sun and the moon both shining bright in the sky . 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the veranda of the front door with ProtagonistA's hands on the knob . ProtagonistA was about to go inside when ProtagonistA heard a noise . It sounded like someone was crying . ProtagonistA got up and followed the noise . It led ProtagonistA to the back door . ProtagonistA opened it and saw ProtagonistB crying . ProtagonistB was sitting in the middle of a big field . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB was lost . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's way home . ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's hand and they started to walk . After a while , they came to a road . ProtagonistB pointed to a house down the road and said that was ProtagonistB's home . ProtagonistA walked with ProtagonistB to the house and knocked on the door . ProtagonistC came to the door and ProtagonistC was ProtagonistB's mother . ProtagonistC was so happy to see ProtagonistB . ProtagonistC thanked ProtagonistA for bringing ProtagonistB's home . 
Figa and ProtagonistA's family were only two children , and they had fallen sick . With an acute hope of death , they were accompanied by great apprehensions . ProtagonistA was awaiting the publication of ProtagonistA's work , which was entitled A History of the World . ProtagonistA determined to devote to the study of it all that was worthy of ProtagonistA's mind and to the satisfaction of the human race . However , before ProtagonistA could do so , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's family fell ill . 
ProtagonistA sulks and sinks back into the bible , ProtagonistA's silver eyes fixed on a section regarding birds . ProtagonistA had been so looking forward to today . It was supposed to be a day of exploration and adventure with ProtagonistA's friends , but instead ProtagonistA was stuck here , in this stuffy old church . ProtagonistA had been dragged here by ProtagonistA's mother who said that ProtagonistA needed to  find ProtagonistA's faith .  ProtagonistA did n't see what was so wrong with ProtagonistA's faith , but ProtagonistA's mother insisted . As ProtagonistA scanned the pages of the bible , ProtagonistA began to feel a bit guilty . Maybe ProtagonistA's mother was right , maybe ProtagonistA did need to find ProtagonistA's faith . After all , what did ProtagonistA know about birds ? ProtagonistA knew they could fly , but that was about it . Suddenly , the door to the church opened and in walked ProtagonistA's friends . They had come to find ProtagonistA , there ProtagonistA are !  they exclaimed . We've been looking all over for ProtagonistA was so happy to see ProtagonistA's friends that ProtagonistA forgot all about ProtagonistA sulking . Together , they went on to have the best day ever . 
ProtagonistA sits cross - legged on the floor of the dark alcove , ProtagonistA's fingers tracing the lines of a small painting . The painting is of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB's face hidden in the shadows . ProtagonistA ca n't see ProtagonistB's face , but ProtagonistA can feel ProtagonistB's pain . ProtagonistB is crying , ProtagonistB's tears falling into the darkness . ProtagonistA feels ProtagonistB's pain , and ProtagonistA wants to help ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA does n't know how , but ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA has to try . 
I see ProtagonistA's Rolls - Royce parked beside my school , said ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA's fancy - picture - tiles on the mantelpiece , and ProtagonistA's clapboard in the corner . ProtagonistB then went on to say that ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA at a party last weekend , and ProtagonistA looked happy and healthy . 
ProtagonistA had been a sailor for many years , and ProtagonistA was very comfortable on ProtagonistA's ship . ProtagonistA had been in many storms and had never been afraid . But one day , ProtagonistA was in a storm that was so bad , ProtagonistA's ship began to sink . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to get off the ship , so ProtagonistA climbed into a lifeboat . But before ProtagonistA could get away , a huge wave came and partially drowned ProtagonistA . When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was on a beach , and ProtagonistA's ship was gone . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , so ProtagonistA just sat there until someone found ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was on the eve of the most important visit of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was to meet the family of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was very nervous and excited about the meeting . ProtagonistA had heard so much about the family and was very curious to meet them . The next day , ProtagonistA met the family and was immediately impressed . They were kind , intelligent and well - spoken . ProtagonistA felt very at ease with them and they soon became friends . ProtagonistB was especially friendly and ProtagonistA felt very drawn to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had a wonderful time with the family and was very sad to say goodbye when the time came . However , ProtagonistA was very grateful for the experience and the memories ProtagonistA had made . 
ProtagonistA's facial features , ProtagonistA's eye color , and ProtagonistA's body , said ProtagonistB , are all different . ProtagonistB was always pointing out how unique ProtagonistA was , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB for it . Even though ProtagonistA was different , ProtagonistA never felt like an outsider . ProtagonistA was always confident and comfortable in ProtagonistA's own skin . One day , when ProtagonistA was out exploring the woods near ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA came across a beautiful butterfly . It was unlike any ProtagonistA had ever seen before . It had ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistA was so amazed by it that ProtagonistA reached out to touch it . As soon as ProtagonistA did , the butterfly flew away . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had been given a special gift . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was always with ProtagonistA , even when ProtagonistA was exploring new places . 
ProtagonistA was in the middle of a heated battle with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had already bested ProtagonistA several times , but ProtagonistA was determined to win this time . ProtagonistA was so focused on the battle that ProtagonistA did n't see ProtagonistB's henchman sneaking up behind ProtagonistA . The henchman grabbed ProtagonistA's cloak , causing ProtagonistA to lose ProtagonistA's grip on ProtagonistA's sword . ProtagonistB took advantage of the situation and knocked ProtagonistA to the ground . ProtagonistB was about to deliver the final blow when ProtagonistA's cloak suddenly came to life and wrapped itself around ProtagonistB's neck , choking ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB's henchman tried to pull the cloak off of ProtagonistB , but it was too late . ProtagonistB was already dead . With ProtagonistB gone , ProtagonistA's cloak released its grip and fell into the arms of the victor . 
ProtagonistA had been thinking all night and ProtagonistA 'd been stumped ever since . ProtagonistA just could n't seem to figure out what ProtagonistA wanted to do with ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA had always been good at school and ProtagonistA had always been told that ProtagonistA was smart , but ProtagonistA just did n't know what ProtagonistA wanted to do with ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA thought about becoming a doctor or a lawyer , but ProtagonistA just could n't decide . ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA was never going to figure it out when ProtagonistA finally fell asleep . 
ProtagonistA had driven for an entire day , and a whole day 's sleep , and had done nothing of note save to be driven to the place ProtagonistA was going to be raped . ProtagonistA had been planning to stop at a hotel for the night , but ProtagonistB had other plans . ProtagonistB had followed ProtagonistA for days , waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike . When ProtagonistA finally stopped for gas , ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistB's chance . ProtagonistB slipped into the passenger seat of ProtagonistA's car and forced ProtagonistA to drive to a remote location . There , ProtagonistB raped ProtagonistA . Afterwards , ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA there to fend for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was able to make it back to civilization , but ProtagonistA was forever changed by the ordeal . 
ProtagonistA had been very wrong in ProtagonistA's belief that I would ever be with anyone , or marry anyone . ProtagonistA had seen me with many different women , and ProtagonistA knew that I was not the type to settle down . ProtagonistA was wrong . I met ProtagonistB . I knew that ProtagonistB was the one for me . I proposed to ProtagonistB , and we were married . I am happy with ProtagonistB , and I know that ProtagonistA was wrong about me . 
ProtagonistA was sitting at ProtagonistA's typewriter , studying the words typed on the screen . ProtagonistA was trying to decide if ProtagonistA should keep going or not . ProtagonistA had been working on this story for weeks , and it just was n't coming together the way ProtagonistA wanted . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door . ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and there was ProtagonistB there with a package . ProtagonistB said it was for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA signed for it and took it inside . ProtagonistA opened it and found a typewriter just like ProtagonistA . It even had the same type of paper in it . ProtagonistA sat down and started typing . The words flowed easily and the story came together perfectly . ProtagonistA was finished in no time . ProtagonistA sat back and smiled . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had made the right decision to keep going . 
ProtagonistA was walking through the turnip bush when ProtagonistA was confronted by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA had ever seen ProtagonistB before , but ProtagonistB seemed familiar . ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was doing in the turnip bush and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA was looking for ProtagonistA's lost cat . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA's cat earlier and offered to help ProtagonistA find it . They searched through the bush together , but they could n't find the cat . ProtagonistA was getting tired and ProtagonistB offered to carry ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistA eventually agreed . ProtagonistB carried ProtagonistA through the bush until they found ProtagonistA's cat . ProtagonistA was so grateful and thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's help . 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the shadow of the building , and ProtagonistA's eyes had the kind of serenity of a few hours spent in a convincing dream . The sun was setting , and the sky was turning a beautiful shade of orange . ProtagonistA felt at peace . ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately and needed a break . This was ProtagonistA's chance to relax and just enjoy the moment . 
ProtagonistA had a habit of making a speech with all the amazing clarity , propriety , and rationalism of a genius , and almost the same effect , when ProtagonistA had finished , as when ProtagonistA had finished ; for ProtagonistA was always going on about something , ever since ProtagonistA had heard it described to ProtagonistA . For instance , ProtagonistA would say ,  ProtagonistA do n't see how people can be so stupid ! ProtagonistA 'm sure if ProtagonistA were in their place ProtagonistA should be much wiser .  And then ProtagonistA would go on to describe how ProtagonistA would have managed things better .  ProtagonistA would have done this , and ProtagonistA would have done that ,  ProtagonistA would say .  ProtagonistA 'm sure ProtagonistA should have thought of a better way . But when it came to actual practice , ProtagonistA was not nearly so successful . ProtagonistA would make a plan for doing something , and then ProtagonistA would forget all about it . Or ProtagonistA would start to do something , and then ProtagonistA would get distracted and not finish it . So , in spite of ProtagonistA's habit of making speeches , ProtagonistA was not really very good at getting things done . 
ProtagonistA has always considered ProtagonistA a strong , independent woman . ProtagonistA 's never been one for following the crowd or conforming to societal norms . So , when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was the one for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB is a free spirit , just like ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB 's always up for a adventure and is always pushing boundaries . So , when ProtagonistA marries ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA 's finally found ProtagonistA's true self . ProtagonistA 's finally found someone who accepts ProtagonistA for who ProtagonistA is and loves ProtagonistA for it . On their wedding day , ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA 's finally become the woman ProtagonistA 's always wanted to be . 
They were sitting together on the leaden plank of the old boat , the aye , but not so long ago when the sailors were shivering in their hundreds , when the water was so deep that even the redskin boys were drowned in it ; when the sun was so low and the sky so black that the fires of the desert were almost out of breath , when the ship was so light that ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head in despair when ProtagonistA saw the captain in the middle of the night going beyond the windward deck , and instead of sinking , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA among the stars , drifting in space , with the power to move anything that ProtagonistA pleased in the universe . 
ProtagonistA has never been to the movies before , but ProtagonistA 's always been involved in them . ProtagonistA 's been a fan of movies since ProtagonistA was a little girl , and ProtagonistA 's always loved going to the theatre to watch them . However , ProtagonistA 's never actually been to a movie theatre ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 's always wanted to , but ProtagonistA 's never had the chance . Yesterday , ProtagonistA finally got ProtagonistA's chance . ProtagonistA went to the movies with ProtagonistA's friends , and ProtagonistA loved it . It was everything ProtagonistA 'd ever dreamed of . The big screen , the surround sound , the popcorn ... ProtagonistA loved it all . ProtagonistA even got to see ProtagonistA's favorite movie ,  The Lion King  , which made the experience even better . ProtagonistA had a great time at the movies , and ProtagonistA ca n't wait to go back . ProtagonistA 's glad ProtagonistA finally got the chance to experience it , and ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA 'll be back for more .

ProtagonistA had many adventures in ProtagonistB and made many new friends . ProtagonistA even met a talking cat ! Eventually , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's way back home and ProtagonistA was very happy to be reunited with ProtagonistA's family . 
ProtagonistA was sailing to San Diego , California in a boat which ProtagonistA called the Lusitania . ProtagonistA was particularly delighted at the prospect of a private audience with the rich and famous . However , the journey was not without incident . A large wave overturned the boat , and ProtagonistA was thrown into the water . Fortunately , ProtagonistA was an excellent swimmer and was able to make it to shore . ProtagonistA was wet , cold , and exhausted , but otherwise unharmed . 
ProtagonistA ran with alacrity through several miles of fields , forests , and meadows , bearing with ProtagonistA the great stuff of life : the apple , the bramble , the cherry - tree , the thorn - trees , and so many trees , some two hundred yards in circumference . ProtagonistA had been running for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting tired . But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep going . ProtagonistA had to find the place where the trees stopped . ProtagonistA had been told that there was a place beyond the trees where the ground was made of something called  grass .  ProtagonistA had never seen grass before , but ProtagonistA had heard that it was soft and green and smelled good . ProtagonistA was hoping that ProtagonistA would find this place soon . Finally , ProtagonistA came to a clearing . In the center of the clearing was a large tree , and around the tree was a ring of smaller trees . ProtagonistA stopped and looked at the tree . It was so big ! ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise . It sounded like someone was coming . ProtagonistA quickly hid behind the tree and waited . ProtagonistA could see movement through the trees , and then ProtagonistA saw a person . It was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA and smiled .  Hi ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB's name is Sarah . What 's ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA forgot to answer . It 's okay ,  ProtagonistB said .  There 's nothing to be afraid of . ProtagonistB wo n't hurt ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA slowly came out from behind the tree .  ProtagonistA's name is Alice ,  ProtagonistA said . It 's nice to meet ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  Where are ProtagonistA going?I'm looking for the place where the trees stop ,  ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistB know where that is ,  ProtagonistB said .  Follow ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB through the trees . After a while , they came to a place where the trees stopped and the ground was covered in grass . This is it ,  ProtagonistB said .  This is the place where the trees stop . ProtagonistA looked around . ProtagonistA could n't believe it ! It was so beautiful ! ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it . Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  This is the most beautiful place ProtagonistA 've ever seen .  
In the beginning was a star , the same star which , in the beginning , ProtagonistA made , the shell of which ProtagonistA fashioned into four parts , the golden - headed , ProtagonistB , the bright - eyed , the yellow - eyed , and the red - eyed . All of these were beautiful , but the golden - headed was the most beautiful of all . One day , while ProtagonistA was out , the golden - headed went to ProtagonistB and said ,  I am the most beautiful of all . ProtagonistB should worship me .  ProtagonistB replied ,  No , ProtagonistB am the most beautiful of all . You should worship ProtagonistB .  This went on for some time , until the golden - headed got angry and said ,  If ProtagonistB do not worship me , I will kill ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB did not worship the golden - headed , so the golden - headed killed ProtagonistB . The same thing happened to the bright - eyed , the yellow - eyed , and the red - eyed . In the end , only the golden - headed remained . 
ProtagonistA had been feeling off for a while . ProtagonistA was tired all the time and ProtagonistA's joints were aching . ProtagonistA thought it was just a phase ProtagonistA was going through and did n't think much of it . But when ProtagonistA started to get short of breath and started to see spots in ProtagonistA's vision , ProtagonistA knew something was n't right . ProtagonistA made an appointment to see ProtagonistB . When ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's symptoms , ProtagonistB did a few tests and then sat ProtagonistA down to give ProtagonistA the news . ProtagonistA had high blood pressure and was in the early stages of dementia . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA needed to make some lifestyle changes and take medication for the rest of ProtagonistA's life . It was a lot to take in , but ProtagonistA was grateful to have a diagnosis and a plan to help ProtagonistA manage ProtagonistA's condition . 
ProtagonistA was a very old , very fat king who lived in a deep , dark corner of the universe . ProtagonistA was so old and so fat that ProtagonistA could barely move .

ProtagonistA are so old and so fat that ProtagonistA can barely move . We think ProtagonistA should see a doctor .

I once had a story of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was also very smart , and could read and write better than most adults . ProtagonistA's parents were very proud of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was always the center of attention . One day , when ProtagonistA was out playing with ProtagonistA's friends , ProtagonistA found a rabbit hole . ProtagonistA was curious , so ProtagonistA decided to follow the rabbit down the hole . ProtagonistA ended up in ProtagonistB . The first thing ProtagonistA saw was a large caterpillar smoking a pipe . ProtagonistA was very curious about ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA met all sorts of interesting creatures . ProtagonistA even met the Queen of Hearts , who was not very nice . But ProtagonistA was not afraid , and ProtagonistA eventually made ProtagonistA's way back home . ProtagonistA's parents were very happy to see ProtagonistA , and they asked ProtagonistA to tell them all about ProtagonistA's adventure . ProtagonistA was happy to oblige , and ProtagonistA told them everything that had happened . ProtagonistA even showed them the pictures ProtagonistA had drawn of all the creatures ProtagonistA had met . ProtagonistA's parents were amazed , and they told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was a very special girl . They said that ProtagonistA could do anything ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to . ProtagonistA believed them , and ProtagonistA went on to have many more adventures . ProtagonistA even wrote a book about ProtagonistA's experiences in ProtagonistB . It was a bestseller , and everyone loved it . ProtagonistA was a very special girl , and ProtagonistA will always be remembered for ProtagonistA's amazing adventure . 
ProtagonistA was walking through town on the left hand side of the road when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was wearing a dress that was too big for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's hair was cut short . ProtagonistA wondered if ProtagonistB was a boy or a girl . ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB's name was . ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB's name was ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who lived in a small town . ProtagonistA was very shy and never spoke to anyone . One day , ProtagonistA saw a rabbit in ProtagonistA's garden and followed it into a hole . ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a strange place where ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to follow ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden where ProtagonistA met a handsome prince . They fell in love and got married . They lived happily ever after . 
ProtagonistA had been in prison for years , and ProtagonistA was getting tired of it . Sleeping was a bitch , ProtagonistA said , as ProtagonistA opened the door of ProtagonistA's old , badly needed and ragged cell . ProtagonistA was planning to escape , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to be careful . ProtagonistA had to be quiet and not attract attention to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA crept out of ProtagonistA's cell and made ProtagonistA's way through the prison , avoiding the guards . ProtagonistA was getting closer and closer to the exit , and ProtagonistA could see the light of freedom . But then , ProtagonistA heard someone coming , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had been caught . 
And then there was ProtagonistA , and it was as if ProtagonistA had been born with a soul , and it was as if ProtagonistA had been born to be a dead man , and it was as though ProtagonistA had been born in the middle of the desert , and it was as though ProtagonistA had been born in the dead of winter , and it was as though ProtagonistA had been born in a small town , and as though ProtagonistA had been born in a small , crowded town , and it had been only twelve here , and there was a full moon , and it had been fenced off and a total of sixty - four people , and no one knew , and nobody was quite sure what the password was , and it did not make any difference , because nobody had ever had the misfortune of knowing what the password was , and nobody had ever going to be a million times as smart as ProtagonistA was , and nobody was n't quite sure how they got into the place , and nobody was quite sure how they started , and nobody had ever known , and nobody had ever really known , and theory was as cold as theory , and theory was what had , as far as anybody was concerned , taken the place of practice ; and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and . 
ProtagonistA was sitting at the table , listening to the conversation around ProtagonistA . It was the summer solstice , and everyone was in a good mood . The sun was shining and the weather was perfect . ProtagonistA was enjoying the company of ProtagonistA's friends and family . Suddenly , someone mentioned the most northeasterly part of the state of Maine . ProtagonistA perked up , interested in hearing more about this place . ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the state of Maine , and ProtagonistA was curious to know more about its most northeasterly part . The person who was talking about it said that it was a beautiful place , and that the summer of 1763 was an especially good time to visit . ProtagonistA was intrigued , and ProtagonistA made a note to ProtagonistA to look into this place further . 
When ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's seventies , ProtagonistA was walking ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a big dog , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly . They would walk for hours together , and ProtagonistA would always make sure to bring ProtagonistB home safe and sound . One day , while they were out walking , ProtagonistA slipped and fell . ProtagonistB immediately ran to ProtagonistA's side , and stayed with ProtagonistA until help arrived . ProtagonistA was grateful to have ProtagonistB by ProtagonistA's side . 
They found ProtagonistA in a little room on the second floor of an apartment building , laying with ProtagonistA's eyes fixed upon a television screen , ProtagonistA's hands resting upon the table . It appeared as though ProtagonistA had been there for some time , as the food on the table was cold and the television was still on . When they tried to talk to ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA did n't respond , and it was clear that ProtagonistA was in a deep trance . They were n't sure what to do , but eventually they decided to call for help . 
The night before ProtagonistA drowned , ProtagonistA had a dream , as it were . ProtagonistA dreamed that ProtagonistA was walking along a path by a river . The river was flowing swiftly and the water looked deep . ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB playing near the water 's edge and ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB , warning ProtagonistB to be careful . But ProtagonistB did n't seem to hear ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB kept playing . Suddenly , ProtagonistB lost ProtagonistB's balance and fell into the river . ProtagonistA ran to the edge of the river , but ProtagonistA could n't reach ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA watched helplessly as ProtagonistB was swept away by the current . When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was crying . 
ProtagonistA , had not changed one bit since the day ProtagonistA had to flee ProtagonistA's homeland . The war had been raging for months , with no end in sight . ProtagonistA's family had been killed in a bombing , and ProtagonistA had barely escaped with ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA had been forced to flee ProtagonistA's home , with only the clothes on ProtagonistA's back and the memories of ProtagonistA's loved ones . ProtagonistA had been living in a refugee camp for the past year , and ProtagonistA was starting to lose hope . ProtagonistA was tired , and hungry , and cold . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's home , and ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's family . But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to keep going . One day , ProtagonistA heard a rumor that there was a way to escape the camp . ProtagonistA did n't know if it was true , but ProtagonistA was willing to try anything . That night , ProtagonistA snuck out of the camp , and started walking . ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving . ProtagonistA walked for days , until ProtagonistA came to a city . ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was safe . ProtagonistA found a job , and a place to live , and ProtagonistA started to build a new life . ProtagonistA is finally starting to feel like ProtagonistA again . ProtagonistA 's made new friends , and ProtagonistA 's started to feel like ProtagonistA belongs . ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA 's lucky to be alive , and ProtagonistA 's determined to make the most of it . 
ProtagonistA called ProtagonistB by ProtagonistA's surname , and we have been called by it ever since . It was a cold winter evening and ProtagonistA had just returned from a long day of work . ProtagonistA was looking forward to relaxing in ProtagonistA's warm apartment , but first ProtagonistA had to make a phone call . ProtagonistA dialed the number and waited for someone to answer .  Hello ?  said a voice on the other end .  Is this the Smith residence ?  asked ProtagonistA .  Yes , it is ,  said the voice .  May ProtagonistA speak to ProtagonistB , please ?  asked ProtagonistA .  I 'm sorry , but ProtagonistB is not available at the moment ,  said the voice .  Can I take a message ?   Yes , please ,  said ProtagonistA .  Could you tell ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA called and ProtagonistA is very sorry for the inconvenience , but ProtagonistA will call back tomorrow ?   I will certainly tell ProtagonistB ,  said the voice .  Thank ProtagonistA for calling .  
ProtagonistA was a woman who loved to move . ProtagonistA was always relocating from one place to another , and ProtagonistA loved the long , slow process of packing up ProtagonistA's things and starting anew . However , the Living always seemed to find a way to beat ProtagonistA to it . They would always find a new place to live before ProtagonistA could even start the process of moving . It was frustrating , but ProtagonistA did n't let it get to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was determined to find a way to beat the Living . Finally , after years of trying , ProtagonistA found a place that the Living could n't find . ProtagonistA was able to move there and start ProtagonistA's new life . 
ProtagonistA , descended the aisle of the château of the Riveuilles ; an imposing house of splendour and distinction , from which ProtagonistA received the name of Richelieu , or Richelodio , or , perhaps , of Lord Bertram . It was a name that held great weight and ProtagonistA knew the responsibility that came with it . ProtagonistA had always been a dutiful daughter , but now ProtagonistA was being called upon to be so much more . ProtagonistA was being called upon to be the head of the family , the one who would lead them into the future . It was a daunting task , but ProtagonistA was up to the challenge . ProtagonistA had always been a natural leader and ProtagonistA was confident in ProtagonistA's abilities . ProtagonistA would make ProtagonistA's ancestors proud . ProtagonistA would make the Riveuilles name mean something again . ProtagonistA walked down the aisle with ProtagonistA's head held high . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had the support of ProtagonistA's family and ProtagonistA would not let them down . ProtagonistA would make them proud . 
ProtagonistA was unaccustomed to the sight of ProtagonistA's brother 's statue with ProtagonistA's father on the Westminster tower . ProtagonistA felt dismayed and intellectually disgraced at what ProtagonistA saw . 
ProtagonistA woke early , and ProtagonistA woke often , as if ProtagonistA had been awake forever , until it was too late . The sun had already set , and the moon was high in the sky . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should have been asleep hours ago , but ProtagonistA could n't help it . ProtagonistA was restless and wide awake . ProtagonistA got out of bed and paced around ProtagonistA's room , trying to tire ProtagonistA out , but it was no use . ProtagonistA eventually gave up and laid down , but ProtagonistA still could n't fall asleep . ProtagonistA stared at the ceiling , ProtagonistA's mind racing , until ProtagonistA finally dozed off . 
ProtagonistA has finished ProtagonistA's work and is ready to go now . ProtagonistA hears the voice even now , telling ProtagonistA to hurry up and get going . ProtagonistA knows that if ProtagonistA does n't hurry , the voice will get angry and start yelling at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA does n't want to anger the voice , so ProtagonistA hurries to get going . 
ProtagonistA had chosen the kingdom of Heaven out of all creation ; and the power of the Holy One of Israel had shone forth in every way , to please ProtagonistA . For ProtagonistA , there was no other place ProtagonistA would rather be than in the company of the Lord and His righteousness . And ProtagonistA was not alone in ProtagonistA's choice ; many others had also chosen the kingdom of Heaven as their final resting place . Together , they formed a community of the blessed , who enjoyed eternal peace and happiness in the presence of their Creator . 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who loved to swim . ProtagonistA was always drawn to the water and loved to spend ProtagonistA's days swimming in the local pool . One day , ProtagonistA went swimming with ProtagonistA's friends and they dared ProtagonistA to swim out to the deep end . ProtagonistA hesitated at first , but then ProtagonistA took the challenge . ProtagonistA swam out to the deep end and then ProtagonistA started to sink . ProtagonistA struggled to swim back to the surface , but ProtagonistA could n't make it . ProtagonistA's friends watched in horror as ProtagonistA drowned . The night before ProtagonistA drowned , ProtagonistA had a dream . In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA was swimming in the pool and ProtagonistA started to sink . ProtagonistA struggled to swim back to the surface , but ProtagonistA could n't make it . ProtagonistA woke up in a cold sweat , but ProtagonistA dismissed the dream as just a nightmare . Little did ProtagonistA know that it was a warning of what was to come . 
ProtagonistA walked the streets of Croydon , and felt as if ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's heart in ProtagonistA's hands . ProtagonistA had never felt this way before , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do with the overwhelming feeling . ProtagonistA wanted to cry , to scream , to let it all out . But ProtagonistA did n't . ProtagonistA just kept walking , ProtagonistA's heart heavy in ProtagonistA's chest . 
ProtagonistA , with ProtagonistB , at ProtagonistA's side , rode out into the great wide plain of Phlegethon , where ProtagonistA found the rest of ProtagonistA's family in the company of Mrs. Elizabeth , the wife of Mr. Eliopolo , the Colonel of the Household at Court , and with whom ProtagonistA was always merry , and who was the cause of much expense to Carol 's owing to the imprudence of ProtagonistA , for ProtagonistA had never thought of it before . They all greeted ProtagonistA warmly , and ProtagonistA was happy to be in their midst once more . They chatted and laughed together , enjoying the fine day , until suddenly they heard a loud noise . They turned to see a large herd of stampeding horses coming towards them , kicking up a cloud of dust . ProtagonistA's father shouted for everyone to get to safety , but it was too late . The horses were upon them in an instant , trampling them underfoot . ProtagonistA was thrown from ProtagonistA's horse and hit ProtagonistA's head on a rock . ProtagonistA lay still , unconscious . The last thing ProtagonistA heard was ProtagonistB screaming for help . 
ProtagonistA stood on the horizon of the world , a proud and proud man , but one who knew ProtagonistA had nothing to fear but might actually have some advantage over a very large and very dangerous enemy . ProtagonistA was armed with a sword and shield , and ProtagonistA had the power of the elements at ProtagonistA's disposal . ProtagonistA was ready to take on anything that came ProtagonistA's way . 
In the year 1251 ProtagonistA loomed over London , and what was the matter with ProtagonistA ? No one could say for sure , but some speculated that ProtagonistA was a giantess . Others said ProtagonistA was a witch who had cast a spell on the city . Whatever the case may have been , ProtagonistA was a fearsome sight . 
It was whispered in the city that ProtagonistA would tell you how it came to pass . And ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA stammered ,  ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB in a dark alley . ProtagonistB had a knife in ProtagonistB's hand and ProtagonistA was terrified . ProtagonistA ran away and hid in a nearby store . ProtagonistA called the police and they came and arrested ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was so shaken up that ProtagonistA decided to move to a different city . And that 's how ProtagonistA came to pass .  
ProtagonistA was a woman who enjoyed the art of murdering . ProtagonistA was also a man who enjoyed the art of murdering . One day , ProtagonistA decided to kill ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA lured ProtagonistB into a dark alley and stabbed ProtagonistB to death . As ProtagonistA walked away , ProtagonistA felt a sense of satisfaction . ProtagonistA had finally gotten ProtagonistA's revenge . 
On a dark and stormy night in July , 1639 , the servant of the lord Bishop of York , who had been appointed by ProtagonistB to receive the precepts of the church , at Lambeth , in the kingdom of England , received an urgent and threatening communication in ProtagonistA's own chamber , which ProtagonistA took very seriously . It was from the hand of ProtagonistB , and it commanded ProtagonistA to appear before ProtagonistB at Lambeth Palace the next morning . Fearing for ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA hastily packed a few belongings and set out for the palace . ProtagonistA was met there by ProtagonistB's guard and taken to the royal presence . ProtagonistB was angry and demanded to know why ProtagonistA had not obeyed ProtagonistB's summons . ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA had been afraid for ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistB then ordered ProtagonistA to be taken to the Tower of London and imprisoned there . 
After the war ended , a little more than a year earlier , we settled in a house in the district of St. Peter 's , in which ProtagonistA had done the best ProtagonistA could . The house was small and cramped , but it was home . We were happy there , despite the circumstances . One day , ProtagonistA came to me with a proposal . ProtagonistA had been thinking about it for a while , ProtagonistA said , and ProtagonistA thought it was time . ProtagonistA wanted to move to the country . I was hesitant at first , but I knew that ProtagonistA was not happy in the city . I agreed , and we began to make plans . A few months later , we were on our way . The move was not easy , but it was worth it . ProtagonistA was happier than I had ever seen ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA loved the peace and quiet of the country , and I loved being able to see ProtagonistA happy . 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's chair on the left , reading a letter ; but the letter was full of facts that were interesting to ProtagonistA , such as , ProtagonistA's uncle was a man of coarse manners , and , in consequence of the poverty of his household , very few persons in its neighbourhood were wealthy , and in whom ProtagonistA had any feeling of sympathy . ProtagonistA had just finished the letter , when ProtagonistA was interrupted by a knock at the door . 
ProtagonistA sat in the sun and ProtagonistA's mind busy . ProtagonistA was thinking about all the things ProtagonistA had to do that day . ProtagonistA had to go to the grocery store , pick up ProtagonistA's dry cleaning , and meet ProtagonistA's friend for lunch . ProtagonistA was also thinking about ProtagonistA's upcoming vacation . ProtagonistA was going to visit ProtagonistA's family in Florida and ProtagonistA was really looking forward to it . 
ProtagonistA can remember the last time ProtagonistA had sex like it was yesterday . ProtagonistA was with ProtagonistB at the time and they were both drunk . They were fooling around and things got a little too heated . ProtagonistA was n't ready to have sex and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB no , but ProtagonistB did n't listen . ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA by force and ProtagonistA will never forget it . All men , of whatever sex , must die , but ProtagonistA will always remember the last time ProtagonistA had sex . It was the worst experience of ProtagonistA's life . 
ProtagonistA was the most famous and adored character in the world . ProtagonistA was called the Angel of Death , or rather the Angel of Death , because ProtagonistA had the audacity to become the Victim of a horrible and terrible crime , which is the least of all crimes . ProtagonistA was just a normal girl , living a normal life . But one day , ProtagonistA was the victim of a brutal attack . ProtagonistA was raped and murdered , and ProtagonistA's body was left in a ditch . The news of ProtagonistA's death shocked the world . How could ProtagonistA be killed so ProtagonistA's death sparked a worldwide movement to end violence against women . Millions of people marched in ProtagonistA's name , and ProtagonistA's story inspired others to speak out against their attackers . ProtagonistA's killers were eventually caught and brought to justice . But ProtagonistA's story continues to inspire people all over the world to stand up against violence and fight for justice . 
One day ProtagonistA came to Washington , and , being highly desirous of seeing the grounds of the new Capitol , refused to leave until ProtagonistA had seen them into which the hall had been enlarged for the new institution ; and if ProtagonistA had been right , ProtagonistA should be justified in saying that ProtagonistA had never seen anything so amiss . The Capitol was in a state of great disorder , and the new building was so ill - contrived that it was almost impossible to find one 's way about it . The floors were uneven , the walls were crooked , and the ceilings were so low that one could not stand upright in many of the rooms . 
ProtagonistA's office was a small , well - furnished , and hot - air - conditioned room . The dozen men who turned into it were immediately struck by the heat . ProtagonistA was a large , well - dressed woman , with a pleasant face and a kind voice . ProtagonistA was sitting behind a desk , and ProtagonistA motioned for the men to sit down . The men were all well - dressed , and they all looked to be in good health . ProtagonistA asked them how they were , and they all said that they were fine . ProtagonistA asked them if they had any news , and they all said that they did not . Finally , ProtagonistA asked them why they had come to see ProtagonistA . The men all looked at each other , and then ProtagonistB spoke up . We're here to ask ProtagonistA for a favor , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  You see , we 're all in a bit of a predicament . ProtagonistA leaned back in ProtagonistA's chair and listened as ProtagonistB explained the situation . It seems that they were all in need of money . They had all been frequenting the same ladies ' houses the summer before , and they had all run into a bit of bad luck . Now , they were all in need of a loan . ProtagonistA thought for a moment , and then ProtagonistA agreed to help them . ProtagonistA told them that ProtagonistA would give them each a loan of £ 400 . The men were all very grateful , and they thanked ProtagonistA profusely . As they were leaving , one of the men turned to ProtagonistA and asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA had agreed to help them . I'm a good Christian woman ,  ProtagonistA said .  And ProtagonistA believe that it is ProtagonistA's duty to help those in need . The men all nodded their heads in agreement , and then they left . ProtagonistA sat back in ProtagonistA's chair and smiled . ProtagonistA was happy to have been able to help the men , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had made the right decision . 
ProtagonistA was born nine months after ProtagonistA's parents got married . ProtagonistB was thrilled to be a dad and doted on ProtagonistA every chance ProtagonistB got . ProtagonistC , was happy to have a child to raise , but ProtagonistC was also worried about how ProtagonistB would take care of ProtagonistA . After all , ProtagonistB was always working and did n't have much time for ProtagonistA . One day , when ProtagonistA was five years old , ProtagonistB came home from work and found ProtagonistC in the kitchen , crying . When ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistC what was wrong , ProtagonistC told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistC had been cheating on ProtagonistB and that ProtagonistA was n't ProtagonistB's daughter . ProtagonistB was devastated . ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA like ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's own , but now ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistA wasn't . ProtagonistB did n't know what to do . ProtagonistB could n't tell ProtagonistC that ProtagonistB knew the truth , but ProtagonistB also could n't continue to pretend like everything was normal . In the end , ProtagonistB decided to move out and start a new life without ProtagonistA . It was the hardest thing ProtagonistB ever had to do , but ProtagonistB knew it was for the best . 
ProtagonistA stopped dead in ProtagonistA's tracks , and then ProtagonistA tried to find the source of the sound . ProtagonistA looked around frantically , but it just was n't there . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA heard it again . This time , it was closer . ProtagonistA followed the sound until ProtagonistA came to a small door . ProtagonistA opened it and found a staircase leading down . ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA heard the sound again . It was coming from below . ProtagonistA started to descend the stairs , but ProtagonistA stopped when ProtagonistA heard a voice . It was a man 's voice , and it was coming from the other side of the door at the bottom of the stairs .  Help me ,  the voice said .  Please , help me .  ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to help . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and opened the door . 
ProtagonistA was walking after dark when ProtagonistA heard a noise behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB following ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA started to run , but ProtagonistB ran after ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA screamed for help , but no one came . ProtagonistB caught up to ProtagonistA and grabbed ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA fought back , but ProtagonistB was too strong . ProtagonistB dragged ProtagonistA into an alley and raped ProtagonistA . Afterwards , ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA there to die . ProtagonistA lay there , bleeding and in pain , until ProtagonistA died . 
I have been listening to the last of the bishoprics and continuing to write to ProtagonistA , to inform ProtagonistA of my intention of moving to Canterbury - upon - Avon . I have been restless since my husband 's death and I feel that it is time for a change . I have been corresponding with ProtagonistA since ProtagonistA moved to Canterbury and ProtagonistA has been telling me all about the wonderful things to see and do there . I know that ProtagonistA will be happy to have me come and stay with ProtagonistA for a while . I am looking forward to exploring all that Canterbury has to offer and getting to know ProtagonistA better . 
ProtagonistA managed to keep ProtagonistA's head and face up , to enjoy the moment . ProtagonistA was standing on the top of the Empire State Building , and the view was incredible . The city was so big and so alive , and ProtagonistA felt so small and insignificant . But in that moment , ProtagonistA felt alive and happy and free . 
ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way to the grocery store when ProtagonistA saw a group of men sitting around on the side of the road . ProtagonistA wondered if they had any leisure time to think about what they would do with their lives . ProtagonistA also wondered if they had any other options besides sitting on the side of the road . ProtagonistA decided to ask them . Excuse ProtagonistA , do you suppose ProtagonistA would have leisure to think of what ProtagonistA would therefore do with the other men who sat around ProtagonistA , and had not a great many of them on the road?One of the men , who appeared to be the leader of the group , spoke up .  We 're not sure what ProtagonistA 're talking about , but we do n't have any leisure time to think about what we would do with our lives . We 're just trying to survive . ProtagonistA was taken aback by their response . ProtagonistA had never considered that they might not have any other options . ProtagonistA thanked them for their time and went on ProtagonistA's way . ProtagonistA was more grateful than ever for ProtagonistA's own life and the opportunities ProtagonistA had been given . ProtagonistA vowed to help others who might not be as fortunate as ProtagonistA was . 
ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer . ProtagonistA would often stay up late into the night , dreaming about what ProtagonistA's life could be . One night , ProtagonistA had the great dream . The dream that ProtagonistA would never take the risk of doing . The dream that would frighten ProtagonistA . The dream that would terrify ProtagonistA . The dream that would make ProtagonistA wish ProtagonistA had never done it . And yet , ProtagonistA could not help but be drawn to it . The ten - year - old boy who took an interest in everything ProtagonistA did was the one who convinced ProtagonistA to take the risk . And so , ProtagonistA drank to the full . 
ProtagonistA was out for a walk on the frozen lake when ProtagonistA heard a crack . The next thing ProtagonistA knew , ProtagonistA was being dragged along the bottom of the lake by the ice . ProtagonistA could feel the cold water numbing ProtagonistA's body and the ice pulling at ProtagonistA's hair . ProtagonistA struggled to free ProtagonistA , but it was no use . ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistA losing consciousness . The last thing ProtagonistA heard was the sound of the ice breaking open and ProtagonistA's own despairing howl . 
There was once ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA always wanted to know what was behind every door and what was inside every box . ProtagonistA's curiosity often got ProtagonistA into trouble , but ProtagonistA always managed to find ProtagonistA's way out again . One day , ProtagonistA came across a door that ProtagonistA had never seen before . It was a beautiful door with golden handles . ProtagonistA could n't resist trying to open it , but it was locked . ProtagonistA shook the handles , but the door would n't budge . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a voice on the other side of the door .  Who is it ?  the voice asked .  It 's me , Alice ,  ProtagonistA replied .  ProtagonistA 'm curious about what 's behind this door .  The voice on the other side of the door chuckled .  I 'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA ca n't come in . This is the door to the forest and it is very dangerous . ProtagonistA must n't go in .  But ProtagonistA was not deterred . ProtagonistA wanted to know what was inside the forest and ProtagonistA was going to find out . ProtagonistA started to look for a key to the door , but ProtagonistA could n't find one anywhere . Then ProtagonistA had an idea . ProtagonistA took out ProtagonistA's pocket knife and started to pick the lock . It took ProtagonistA a while , but eventually ProtagonistA managed to open the door . ProtagonistA walked into the forest and ProtagonistA was never seen again . 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who had a fear of abandonment . ProtagonistA was always afraid that someone would leave ProtagonistA , or that ProtagonistA would be alone . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's family and friends , but ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was the odd one out . When ProtagonistA was a little old man , ProtagonistA saw everything in the world and ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistA would never be able to find love . ProtagonistA was wrong . One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB did n't care about ProtagonistA's past or ProtagonistA's fears . ProtagonistB only cared about ProtagonistA's present and ProtagonistA's future . They were married and had a beautiful life together . 
ProtagonistA's eyes were aflame with curiosity as ProtagonistA listened to the news . ProtagonistA had always been interested in the world beyond ProtagonistA's small town , and now ProtagonistA had the chance to explore it . ProtagonistA was going to be a part of a group of students who were going to travel to different countries to learn about their cultures . ProtagonistA could n't wait to see the world and learn about all the different people in it . 
ProtagonistA had always loved the stone house in ProtagonistE's garden . It was ProtagonistA's favorite place to play as a child . ProtagonistA would pretend ProtagonistA was a princess living in a castle , and the stone house was ProtagonistA's fortress . As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to wonder about the history of the house . Who had built it ? Why was it built on the foundation of an old house?One day , as ProtagonistA stood in the garden , tracing the outlines of the structure ProtagonistA had built there , the man who would become known as the Great Scribe of the Old Testament , or , as some people called ProtagonistB , the Habite Cretan , or simply the Lost Scribe , began to write . ProtagonistB told the story of the house , how it was built by ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC wanted to build ProtagonistD a house that would befit ProtagonistD's station , so ProtagonistC had the best architects and masons in the land build ProtagonistD a stone house . ProtagonistB told how ProtagonistD fell in love with a commoner , and how ProtagonistC was so enraged that ProtagonistC had the man killed . ProtagonistD was so heartbroken that ProtagonistD took ProtagonistD's own life . ProtagonistC was so distraught that ProtagonistC had the house torn down , and it was never rebuilt . ProtagonistB told how , centuries later , ProtagonistE had found the old foundation and decided to build a new house on it . ProtagonistE had no idea of the history of the house , but ProtagonistA now knew . And ProtagonistA would always remember ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA had been shopping online for ProtagonistA's groceries for weeks , and ProtagonistA always used Walmart . ProtagonistA was happy with the prices and the selection , and ProtagonistA never had any problems . But then , one day , ProtagonistA had a tussle with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was supposed to help ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's purchase , but instead , ProtagonistB drove ProtagonistA into the blackness of ProtagonistA's apartment . ProtagonistA was so angry that ProtagonistA decided to never shop at Walmart again . 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who had been living in a city of indeterminate size and location for the last three thousand years . The city was a refuge for those who wished to escape the anarchy that had swept the earth . ProtagonistA was one of the few people who had been able to find a way to put an end to the anarchy . ProtagonistA did this by taking refuge in the city . 
I remember as a child very well what it was like to grow up in a house with ProtagonistA , and the duty of having trouble with ProtagonistA . I would often find myself in ProtagonistA's way , and ProtagonistA would always be quick to tell me off . It was as if ProtagonistA enjoyed making me feel small and insignificant . I grew to resent ProtagonistA , and our relationship was always strained . As we got older , ProtagonistA began to struggle with ProtagonistA's mental health . ProtagonistA would have episodes where ProtagonistA would become paranoid and believe that people were out to get ProtagonistA . I would often find ProtagonistA in a corner , rocking back and forth and muttering to ProtagonistA . It was heartbreaking to see ProtagonistA like that , and I wished that I could do something to help ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA's mental health took a turn for the worse and ProtagonistA ended up harming ProtagonistA . I found ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's room , covered in blood and I knew that I had to get help . I called an ambulance and ProtagonistA was taken to hospital . Thankfully , ProtagonistA is now doing much better and ProtagonistA is on the road to recovery . Our relationship is still strained , but I am grateful that ProtagonistA is still here with me . 
ProtagonistA rose early that morning , lifting ProtagonistA's ten - pound hammer from the table before she and pounding the ground . ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's house for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to see some progress . ProtagonistA was determined to finish it by ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was not going to let anything stop ProtagonistA . As ProtagonistA worked , ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's life and how much it had changed in the past year . ProtagonistA used to be a happy , carefree person , but now ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was constantly fighting just to keep ProtagonistA's head above water . It was exhausting , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to keep going . ProtagonistA worked all morning , and by the time lunchtime rolled around , ProtagonistA was ready to take a break . ProtagonistA was just about to sit down when ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance . It sounded like someone was crying . ProtagonistA followed the sound until ProtagonistA came to a clearing . There , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB sitting on the ground , crying ProtagonistB's eyes out . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistA could n't just leave ProtagonistB there . ProtagonistA sat down next to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what was wrong . ProtagonistB sniffed and wiped ProtagonistB's eyes before ProtagonistB started to speak .  ProtagonistC are getting a divorce ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistC is moving away , and ProtagonistB 'm going to have to go with ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB do n't want to leave ProtagonistB's mom . ProtagonistA did n't know what to say , but ProtagonistA hugged ProtagonistB tightly . ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistB that everything was going to be alright , even though ProtagonistA did n't know if that was true . ProtagonistB eventually stopped crying , and ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA talked for a while longer . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's own life and how ProtagonistA was also going through a tough time . ProtagonistB felt better knowing ProtagonistB was n't alone . Eventually , ProtagonistA helped ProtagonistB to ProtagonistB's feet and walked ProtagonistB's home . ProtagonistA made sure to get ProtagonistB's address so ProtagonistA could keep in touch . ProtagonistA went home feeling exhausted , but also grateful . ProtagonistA was reminded that even though ProtagonistA's own life was tough , there were others who were going through worse . ProtagonistA was determined to help them however ProtagonistA could . 
ProtagonistA was happy when I first met ProtagonistA . The first thing I ever thought of ProtagonistA was that ProtagonistA was a holy man , and a good man . ProtagonistA always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face , and ProtagonistA was always willing to help others . ProtagonistA was a true example of what a good person should be . 
ProtagonistA was once a highly respected merchant . ProtagonistA was known for ProtagonistA's profound knowledge of everything of which ProtagonistA was concerned . This included the fine arts of navigation , the principles of shipbuilding , and the use of explosives . ProtagonistA was also known for ProtagonistA's extensive labour . ProtagonistA was always willing to help others and to share ProtagonistA's knowledge . 
ProtagonistA was the god of the seas , and ProtagonistB had a hard time determining ProtagonistB's true identity . ProtagonistB had been a sailor for as long as ProtagonistB could remember , and the sea had always been ProtagonistB's home . But now , as ProtagonistB looked at the world above the waves , ProtagonistB felt like a stranger . ProtagonistB was n't sure who ProtagonistB was anymore , or what ProtagonistB's place in the world was . Was ProtagonistB still a sailor ? Or was ProtagonistB something more ? ProtagonistB was n't sure , but ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB had to find out . 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA was approached by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB demanded twenty - five dollars from ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA could hardly have imagined that ProtagonistA 'd be obliged to pay that load . ProtagonistA tried to explain to ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA did n't have that much money on ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB did n't believe ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB threatened to call the police if ProtagonistA did n't give ProtagonistB the money , so ProtagonistA reluctantly gave ProtagonistB the money . ProtagonistB walked away , leaving ProtagonistA standing there , feeling angry and frustrated . 
ProtagonistA was finding it difficult to focus on ProtagonistA's reading . It was an afternoon of some utility ; it was the middle of January , 1863 , and ProtagonistA was working ProtagonistA's way through an appendix to the first edition of The Origin of Species , which ProtagonistA was carrying with ProtagonistA on ProtagonistA's arm at all times , though ProtagonistA was at times so much employed as to be at rest . ProtagonistA kept getting distracted by ProtagonistA's thoughts , which kept wandering to the current state of affairs . The country was in the midst of a civil war , and ProtagonistA's home state of Virginia was on the side of the Confederacy . ProtagonistA could n't help but worry about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB terribly and wondered if ProtagonistA would ever see ProtagonistB again . ProtagonistA forced ProtagonistA to focus on ProtagonistA's reading again . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA needed to keep ProtagonistA's mind occupied or ProtagonistA would go crazy with worry . ProtagonistA read on , but ProtagonistA's mind kept wandering . It was an afternoon of some utility , but it was also an afternoon of worry and distraction for ProtagonistA . 
The first time I saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was dancing through the streets of New York in a red hot mess of a car and a packed black crowd of people , mostly women and children . ProtagonistA was laughing and singing and ProtagonistA's hair was flying in the wind . ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life . I was so jealous . I wished I could be like ProtagonistA , carefree and happy . But I knew I could never be like that . I was too shy and too scared of what other people would think of me . So I just watched ProtagonistA from afar and envied ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was a dull boy , but not to the point of being a loner , except in the locality where ProtagonistA had an uncle , an aunt , and a cousin ; and as ProtagonistA was such a person , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA quite agreeable to everybody , even to the great majority of ProtagonistA's elders . One day , while ProtagonistA was out walking , ProtagonistA met a stranger who asked ProtagonistA for directions . ProtagonistA was happy to help , and the two ended up chatting for a while . The stranger was very friendly , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA enjoying the conversation . When the stranger asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA wanted to come back to their house for some tea , ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then decided to go . It was only when ProtagonistA was inside the stranger 's house that ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had been tricked . The stranger had kidnapped ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistA was terrified , and tried to escape , but it was no use . The stranger locked ProtagonistA in a room and told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA would never be found . ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA would die there , all alone . But then , one day , the door to ProtagonistA's room opened and ProtagonistA was released . The stranger had been caught by the police , and ProtagonistA was finally free . ProtagonistA was glad to be safe , but the experience had left ProtagonistA shaken , and ProtagonistA vowed never to talk to strangers again . 
One morning , after the close of our first term , when the pain on my hand was beginning to subside , ProtagonistA issued a paper which ProtagonistA supposed to be a communication from ProtagonistB , for it bore the stamp of ProtagonistB's office , and was filled with the seal of the State . It ran as follows:The King of Hearts desires the pleasure of ProtagonistA's company at a Court Ball to be given this evening in honor of the visiting Princess of Hearts . ProtagonistA was so delighted that ProtagonistA could hardly contain ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA went at once to tell ProtagonistA's father and mother of the good news . They were both pleased , and ProtagonistA's father said ProtagonistA might go if ProtagonistA liked , but ProtagonistA must be back by midnight . ProtagonistA was ready long before the time , and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's parents set out for the palace in good spirits . On their arrival they were ushered into a magnificent hall , where the King and Queen and the Princess were already seated . ProtagonistB was very gracious to ProtagonistA , and asked ProtagonistA to dance with ProtagonistB ; and ProtagonistA did so , feeling quite proud and happy . ProtagonistA noticed , however , that the Queen looked very stern and angry , and ProtagonistA wondered what was the matter . After a time ProtagonistA was sorry ProtagonistA had come , for the Queen kept scowling at ProtagonistA so fiercely that it quite frightened ProtagonistA ; and then , when ProtagonistA was tired of dancing , ProtagonistA wanted to go home , but ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA must stay till midnight . At last the clocks struck twelve , and ProtagonistA was free to go . As ProtagonistA was leaving the hall the Queen said to ProtagonistA in a loud voice ,  ProtagonistA are nothing but a common little girl , and I 'll have ProtagonistA sent to prison for coming here without an ProtagonistA was so astonished at this that ProtagonistA could not speak ; but ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA outside the palace doors in a moment , and running down the steps as fast as ProtagonistA could . 
ProtagonistA did not know whether ProtagonistA should rejoice or cry . On one hand , ProtagonistB had just given ProtagonistA a raise and a promotion . On the other hand , ProtagonistA's best friend had just been diagnosed with cancer . As ProtagonistA sat at ProtagonistA's desk , ProtagonistA vacillated between feelings of happiness and sadness . ProtagonistA was so caught up in ProtagonistA's thoughts that ProtagonistA did n't hear ProtagonistB come up to ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA okay ?  ProtagonistB asked , concern etched on ProtagonistB's face .  Yes , ProtagonistA 'm fine ,  ProtagonistA replied , forced a smile .  ProtagonistA 'm just happy and sad at the same time .  
ProtagonistA was just a boy when ProtagonistA had a dream . In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA was a beautiful princess who lived in a castle . ProtagonistA had long , flowing hair and a beautiful dress . ProtagonistA was loved by everyone , and ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA ever wanted . One day , ProtagonistA met a handsome prince , and they fell in love . They got married and lived happily ever after . 
ProtagonistA put ProtagonistA's hand on the glass , and slowly , with a gentle pressure , leaned it to the side . ProtagonistA felt the coolness of the glass against ProtagonistA's skin and the smoothness of the surface . The glass was heavy , but ProtagonistA was able to move it with ProtagonistA's hand . ProtagonistA slowly leaned the glass until it was at a 45-degree angle . Then ProtagonistA stopped and looked at the glass . ProtagonistA could see the reflection of ProtagonistA's hand in the glass . The hand looked small and delicate . ProtagonistA felt the weight of the glass against her hand and the pressure of the glass against ProtagonistA's skin . ProtagonistA slowly lowered the glass back to the table . 
ProtagonistA was waiting for ProtagonistB , just as ProtagonistA usually was . But today , ProtagonistB was late . ProtagonistA checked ProtagonistA's watch and tapping ProtagonistA's foot impatiently . ProtagonistA was just about to give up and go home when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB running towards ProtagonistA , out of breath .  ProtagonistB 'm so sorry ,  ProtagonistB panted .  ProtagonistB got held up at work .   It 's fine ,  ProtagonistA replied , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little disappointed . ProtagonistA had been looking forward to spending time with ProtagonistB . 
It was not long before ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA was being mentioned in whispers of name and nationality . ProtagonistA had only been living in the small town for a few months , but it seemed like everyone knew who ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA was the only foreigner in town , and ProtagonistA stood out like a sore thumb . ProtagonistA tried to keep to ProtagonistA , but it was hard when everyone was always staring at ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA went into the local grocery store and the cashier started whispering to the person next to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistA's face getting red , and ProtagonistA quickly paid for ProtagonistA's things and left . ProtagonistA was sure that they were talking about ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA did n't want to give them the satisfaction of knowing that they had gotten to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA started to feel like a prisoner in ProtagonistA's own home , and ProtagonistA longed to go back to ProtagonistA's home country . ProtagonistA missed the bustling city and the anonymity that came with it . Here , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was always under a microscope . One day , ProtagonistA could n't take it anymore and ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and left . ProtagonistA did n't look back , and ProtagonistA did n't say goodbye to anyone . ProtagonistA was done with this small town and the people in it . 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA knew the way to heaven but in fact ProtagonistA knew nothing at all . ProtagonistA had always been a good person , ProtagonistA had never lied or cheated or stolen . ProtagonistA had always helped others and ProtagonistA had always been kind . Surely that would be enough to get ProtagonistA into heaven . But as ProtagonistA stood at the gates of heaven , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been wrong . There was no way into heaven that ProtagonistA could see . ProtagonistA was about to turn away and give up when ProtagonistA heard a voice . ProtagonistA ,  the voice said .  ProtagonistA have always been a good person . ProtagonistA have helped others and ProtagonistA have been kind . But there is one more thing ProtagonistA must do before ProtagonistA can enter heaven . What is it ?  ProtagonistA asked . ProtagonistA must forgive ProtagonistA ,  the voice said . ProtagonistA was surprised . ProtagonistA had never thought that ProtagonistA needed to forgive ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA had made mistakes in ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA had hurt people , even if ProtagonistA had n't meant to . Forgiving ProtagonistA was the hardest thing ProtagonistA had ever done , but ProtagonistA knew it was the right thing to do . And once ProtagonistA had forgiven ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA found that the gates of heaven were open to ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was walking through the park when ProtagonistA overheard two women whispering . ProtagonistA could n't help but overhear them mention ProtagonistA's name and nationality . ProtagonistA felt a pang of sadness that ProtagonistA was the topic of their conversation . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could just disappear and be invisible . 
ProtagonistA was very old . ProtagonistA had lived a long and happy life , but now ProtagonistA was ready to move on . ProtagonistA had seen all ProtagonistA's friends and family pass away , and ProtagonistA was ready to join them . ProtagonistA looked back on ProtagonistA's life with happiness and gratitude , and then ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and passed away . 
ProtagonistA was taking a walk one day when ProtagonistA suddenly realized that ProtagonistA had been born . ProtagonistA was amazed at how much ProtagonistA had changed since then . ProtagonistA had grown taller , ProtagonistA's hair was different , and ProtagonistA was wearing different clothes . ProtagonistA wondered how ProtagonistA's life would have been different if ProtagonistA had never been born . 
ProtagonistA comes at night , the terror of ProtagonistA's lips , limber and voice , stronger than the deathbringer that lay before ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's teeth are black from blood . ProtagonistA had killed before , but never like this . ProtagonistA was a predator , and ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's prey . ProtagonistB was helpless , and ProtagonistA knew it . ProtagonistA could see the fear in ProtagonistB's eyes , and ProtagonistA reveled in it . ProtagonistA was going to enjoy this . ProtagonistA leaned in close , ProtagonistA lips inches from ProtagonistB's neck , and ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistB's pulse racing . ProtagonistA could smell the fear on ProtagonistB , and it was intoxicating . ProtagonistA smiled , and then ProtagonistA struck . 
The first time I met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was lying on a hospital table in the middle of London . ProtagonistA was so still and pale that I thought ProtagonistA was dead . But then I saw the rise and fall of ProtagonistA's chest and I knew ProtagonistA was just asleep . I felt a sudden surge of relief and happiness . I did n't know who ProtagonistA was , but I knew that ProtagonistA was going to be okay . 
ProtagonistB had ProtagonistA , and when ProtagonistA was five years old ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a name . ProtagonistB named ProtagonistA after ProtagonistB's mother , who had died when ProtagonistA was just a baby . 
ProtagonistA was a historian who loved nothing more than spending ProtagonistA's days reading old books in ProtagonistA's study in the Court of the Tuileries . ProtagonistA was particularly interested in books about the French Revolution , and ProtagonistA had just found an old and heavy book about the subject which ProtagonistA was eagerly reading . However , ProtagonistA's happiness was short - lived . Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's chest and ProtagonistA collapsed to the floor . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was dying , and ProtagonistA had just enough time to think about ProtagonistA's life and all that ProtagonistA had accomplished before ProtagonistA passed away . 
ProtagonistA , kept up for the last two years of the reign of Suddistharma , a fine , fine trade and business , in which the prosperity of the kingdom depended greatly , from a view of employment to the general good , and from a view of revenue to the interest of a great many millions of pounds , which ProtagonistA called a royal prerogative , and which ProtagonistA possessed by extraction , or some other means which I may not venture to mention here , although , in truth , it was of considerable consequence to ProtagonistA's current business . 
ProtagonistA stood up from the log ProtagonistA 'd been sitting on and peered out from the dark cover of ProtagonistA's tea cup . It was getting late , and the woods were starting to look a bit scary . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should n't have come out here by ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA had been so curious about the strange noise ProtagonistA 'd heard . Now ProtagonistA was regretting ProtagonistA's decision . ProtagonistA started to back away from the edge of the woods , when ProtagonistA heard the noise again . It sounded like something was coming towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA froze in fear , not knowing what to do . Suddenly , a large rabbit jumped out from the bushes and ran towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was so scared ProtagonistA screamed and ran the other way . ProtagonistA did n't stop until ProtagonistA was safely back at ProtagonistA's house . ProtagonistA vowed never to go into the woods by ProtagonistA again . 
ProtagonistA had just become a full - grown man , and ProtagonistB was already paying ProtagonistA's attention . ProtagonistB caressed ProtagonistA's nose and said , with a smile over ProtagonistB's mouth ,  ProtagonistB do n't suppose ProtagonistA 's ever heard of the Luke the ProtagonistA was taken aback . ProtagonistA had never heard of ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistA did n't want to show ProtagonistA's ignorance . ProtagonistA smiled back at ProtagonistB and said ,  Of course ProtagonistA have . ProtagonistA 'm a big fan . Mr . Church was pleased .  ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA might be ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'm a big fan of ProtagonistC ProtagonistB . In fact , ProtagonistB 'm writing a book about ProtagonistC . Really ?  ProtagonistA said , genuinely interested .  ProtagonistA 'd love to read it when it 's finished . I'll make sure ProtagonistA get a copy ,  ProtagonistB said . And so began a beautiful friendship between ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB . They would spend hours talking about ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistA even helped ProtagonistB with ProtagonistB's book . It was published to great acclaim , and ProtagonistA was proud to have played a part in it . 
ProtagonistA lived a long and difficult life . For the first four hundred years , ProtagonistA never trusted anyone except during the most extreme times of ProtagonistA's suffering . These were hard times , indeed , but ProtagonistA never gave up . ProtagonistA continued to fight and survive , even when it seemed like there was no hope left . In the end , ProtagonistA prevailed and lived to tell the tale . 
I remember when ProtagonistA added England to the list of places ProtagonistA visited . ProtagonistA never left England , thank heaven . ProtagonistA was always so excited to see new places and meet new people . England was ProtagonistA's favorite place to visit . ProtagonistA loved the history and the culture . ProtagonistA was always so amazed by the architecture and the art . ProtagonistA would spend hours walking around the city , taking in all the sights . ProtagonistA was always so happy when ProtagonistA was there . 
ProtagonistA had been dreaming of snow since ProtagonistA had been a boy . ProtagonistA loved the way it looked , the way it smelled , and the way it felt . ProtagonistA would spend hours outside in the snow , making snowmen and snow angels . When ProtagonistA was older , ProtagonistA even learned how to ski and snowboard . ProtagonistA loved everything about winter . But then , one winter , something changed . ProtagonistA started having nightmares about the snow . In ProtagonistA's nightmares , the snow was cold and unforgiving , burying people alive and turning them into ice sculptures . ProtagonistA would wake up in a cold sweat , heart racing , and ProtagonistA would never want to go outside again . The snow became a symbol of ProtagonistA's fear , and ProtagonistA did everything ProtagonistA could to avoid it . ProtagonistA stopped skiing and snowboarding , and ProtagonistA stopped going outside altogether when the snow started falling . ProtagonistA became a hermit , living in ProtagonistA's house and only going out when ProtagonistA absolutely had to . But one day , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was letting ProtagonistA's fear control ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was missing out on all the things ProtagonistA loved because ProtagonistA was too afraid to face ProtagonistA's fears . So , ProtagonistA took a deep breath and walked outside into the snow . And you know what ? It was n't so bad . The snow was cold , but it was n't scary . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA's nightmares were just that - nightmares . They were n't real . ProtagonistA started going outside again , and ProtagonistA even went skiing and snowboarding . ProtagonistA was living ProtagonistA's life again , and ProtagonistA was happy . 
ProtagonistA must have gone insane , for ProtagonistA could n't keep ProtagonistA's hands to the wheel . ProtagonistA was driving down the highway , and the car was swerving all over the place . ProtagonistA was laughing and singing at the top of ProtagonistA's lungs , and ProtagonistA did n't seem to care that ProtagonistA was in danger . Finally , ProtagonistA lost control of the car and it careened off the road . ProtagonistA was ejected from the car and killed instantly . ProtagonistA's last words were ,  ProtagonistA 'm free !  
ProtagonistA had always been a special girl . ProtagonistA was born with a gift -- the ability to see the future . When ProtagonistA was just eleven years old , ProtagonistA had a vision of a great disaster that was going to happen in ProtagonistA's hometown . ProtagonistA tried to warn ProtagonistA's family and friends , but they just laughed at ProtagonistA and called ProtagonistA a crazy girl . But ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA saw was real . Sure enough , just a few weeks later , ProtagonistA's vision came true . A massive earthquake struck ProtagonistA's hometown , killing hundreds of people . ProtagonistA was the only one who had known about the disaster beforehand . ProtagonistA was able to warn ProtagonistA's loved ones and help them to safety . Ever since then , ProtagonistA has used ProtagonistA's gift to help others . ProtagonistA has helped to solve crimes , find missing people , and even save lives . ProtagonistA is truly a remarkable young woman . 
There was once a boy who was known to everyone but ProtagonistA by ProtagonistA's given name – a boy called Noah , who was supposed to have been born in the year 1224 , on the very day that ProtagonistA was , according to some versions , murdered by a demon . It was said that ProtagonistB had the power to control the weather and that ProtagonistB could make it rain or snow whenever ProtagonistB wanted . Some people even claimed that ProtagonistB could make the sun rise or set just by thinking about it . ProtagonistA was the only person who knew ProtagonistB's true identity – and ProtagonistA was the only one who knew that ProtagonistB was n't really a boy at all , but a creature from another world who had come to Earth in order to help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB had been sent to protect ProtagonistA from the demon that was trying to kill ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was supposed to use ProtagonistB's powers to help ProtagonistA defeat the demon and send it back to the underworld . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB became friends , and together they were able to defeat the demon . After the battle was over , ProtagonistB had to return to ProtagonistB's own world . ProtagonistA was sad to see ProtagonistB go , but ProtagonistA was also happy that ProtagonistB had been able to help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew that they would always be friends , no matter what . 
ProtagonistB was the last man ProtagonistA saw before ProtagonistA left the East India ocean . ProtagonistB was a forgotten white - bearded beauty , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistC's day was coming . ProtagonistB did n't believe ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB did n't want to take any chances . ProtagonistB stayed up all night , watching the waves and waiting for ProtagonistC to come . But ProtagonistC never came . ProtagonistB was relieved , but ProtagonistB was also a little disappointed . ProtagonistB had never seen ProtagonistC before , and ProtagonistB was curious to know what ProtagonistC looked like . 
ProtagonistA's godfather took ProtagonistA to see Mummy , ProtagonistB's sweetheart , ProtagonistB's sister , Mummy . It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever met ProtagonistA's extended family and ProtagonistA was excited to finally put faces to the names ProtagonistA had heard so much about . ProtagonistB was kind and loving , ProtagonistB's sweetheart was funny and charming , and ProtagonistB's sister was just like ProtagonistB in every way . ProtagonistA felt right at home with ProtagonistA's new family and knew that ProtagonistA would always be loved and accepted by them . 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who lived in a small town . ProtagonistA was always curious about the world and loved to explore . One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole that led ProtagonistA into a strange and wonderful place . ProtagonistA met many interesting characters along the way and had many adventures . In the end , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's way back home and was able to share ProtagonistA's stories with everyone . 
There was once , and there will always be one , Doctor LeDeux , a man who said ProtagonistA was going to be a god and that ProtagonistA was going to take over the universe and rule it and make the best of it . ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA , even when ProtagonistA did n't believe in ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB believed in ProtagonistA when no one else did . ProtagonistA was always a special girl , even from a young age . ProtagonistA always seemed to have a greater purpose . ProtagonistB saw this in ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB nurtured it . ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA to develop ProtagonistA's powers and to learn how to use them . As ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA realised that what ProtagonistB had said was true . ProtagonistA was destined to rule the universe . And ProtagonistA was going to make the best of it . ProtagonistA was going to make it a better place for everyone . ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA , even when ProtagonistA did n't believe in ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB believed in ProtagonistA when no one else did . And ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB for it . 
The first time I met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was in the kitchen of ProtagonistA's Nantucket house , stirring a pot of oysters and staring in the mirror . ProtagonistA was wearing a red dress and ProtagonistA's hair was up in a messy bun . ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA was a million miles away . I cleared my throat to get ProtagonistA's attention and ProtagonistA turned around , looking startled .  Oh , ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA did n't see you there .  I introduced myself and ProtagonistA shook my hand , still looking a bit dazed .  It 's nice to meet you ,  ProtagonistA finally said .  ProtagonistA 'm Alice .  
ProtagonistA was dead , and ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB's name was John , and ProtagonistB was a cruel and heartless ruler . The people of the kingdom were terrified of ProtagonistB , and they did everything ProtagonistB said . One day , ProtagonistB decided ProtagonistB wanted to marry ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was terrified of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did n't want to disobey ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA did n't marry ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB would kill ProtagonistA . So , ProtagonistA agreed to marry ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was very happy , and ProtagonistB had a grand wedding . ProtagonistA was miserable , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to pretend to be happy . After the wedding , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB's bedchamber and raped ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA cried and begged ProtagonistB to stop , but ProtagonistB did n't listen . ProtagonistB just kept going until ProtagonistB was finished . ProtagonistA was traumatized by the experience , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never be able to forget it . 
ProtagonistA was a man , or at least ProtagonistA looked like one , of unquestionable fortune . ProtagonistA was always impeccably dressed in the latest fashions and carried ProtagonistA with the air of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA's features were sharp and angular , ProtagonistA's eyes piercing and cold . ProtagonistA was the kind of person that made others uncomfortable without knowing why . ProtagonistA always had a feeling that ProtagonistA was different from everyone else , but ProtagonistA could n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on why . ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was playing a role in some grand performance , but ProtagonistA did n't know what the end goal was . One day , ProtagonistA decided to find out more about ProtagonistA's past . ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's parents ' house and rummaged through their things , looking for anything that could give ProtagonistA a clue . ProtagonistA found a box hidden away in a cupboard that contained old letters and photos . As ProtagonistA looked through the contents of the box , ProtagonistA finally began to piece together the truth . ProtagonistA was adopted . ProtagonistA's real parents had been killed in a car accident when ProtagonistA was just a baby . ProtagonistA felt like everything suddenly made sense . ProtagonistA was a man , or at least ProtagonistA looked like one , because that 's what ProtagonistA's parents had raised ProtagonistA to be . They had wanted ProtagonistA to have a better life than they had , and so they had given ProtagonistA everything they could . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA owed it to ProtagonistA's parents to make something of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was going to make them proud , even if they were no longer alive to see it . 
ProtagonistA was in a dream in which ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was very handsome and had a kind heart . The two of them hit it off immediately and began to talk . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life and how ProtagonistB was the son of ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB also told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's love for nature and the outdoors . ProtagonistA was very interested in everything ProtagonistB had to say . The two of them talked for hours , until finally , it was time for ProtagonistA to wake up . When ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA was surprised to find that ProtagonistA was actually in ProtagonistB's arms . ProtagonistA did n't know how it was possible , but ProtagonistA did n't care . All ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistA was happy to be there . 
There was ProtagonistA in a village where ProtagonistA had no name , and from whence ProtagonistA looked no more than a village - name ; and ProtagonistA was well known to everybody , and was a good , honest boy in everything .... But one day ProtagonistB came to the village , and ProtagonistB had a name , and ProtagonistB was well known to nobody . And ProtagonistB said to ProtagonistA ,  What is ProtagonistA's name ?  And ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA have no name .  And ProtagonistB said ,  That is a pity , for if ProtagonistA had a name ProtagonistA would be as well known as ProtagonistB am , and everybody would know ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA would be a good , honest boy in everything .  And then ProtagonistB went away , and ProtagonistA was left in the village with no name . 
When ProtagonistA had reached ProtagonistA's thirtieth year , the celebrated author works of M. de la Tourgave presented themselves before ProtagonistA in extraordinary fashion . ProtagonistA had always enjoyed ProtagonistB's novels , but never dreamed that ProtagonistA would one day have the opportunity to meet ProtagonistB in person . It was at a dinner party given by one of ProtagonistA's friends that ProtagonistA finally had the chance to speak with ProtagonistB . They struck up a conversation and discovered that they had a lot in common . Eventually , they began dating and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA falling in love with ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA is sixteen , and ProtagonistA really is a genius , or at least a great talent . ProtagonistA 's been homeschooled ProtagonistA's whole life by ProtagonistA's parents , who are both geniuses themselves . ProtagonistA's parents are always telling ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA has the potential to be even greater than they are . ProtagonistA is a math prodigy .

However , it took a few minutes for the light to catch and ProtagonistA began to feel the heat of the flames . ProtagonistA placed ProtagonistA's hand on the counter to steady ProtagonistA , and then ProtagonistA saw the kitchen begin to fill with smoke .

ProtagonistA was walking home from school when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing in ProtagonistA's path . ProtagonistA knew who ProtagonistB was immediately .  Hello , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 've been watching ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB know that ProtagonistA 're a special girl . ProtagonistB 'm here to offer ProtagonistA a deal .  ProtagonistA knew better than to make a deal with ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was curious to hear what ProtagonistB had to say .  If ProtagonistA give ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's soul , ProtagonistB will make all of ProtagonistA's dreams come true . ProtagonistA will be rich , beautiful , and loved by everyone .  ProtagonistB made it sound so tempting , but ProtagonistA knew better .  No , thank ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm not interested .

ProtagonistA's life changed forever the day ProtagonistA stepped down from the roof of the Lancaster Moor house . ProtagonistA had been up there for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had found out that ProtagonistA's parents were getting a divorce . ProtagonistA could n't believe that they were actually going to go through with it . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA's life was falling apart .

ProtagonistA was walking to ProtagonistA's office when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye . ProtagonistB's name was Lloyd Lorenge and ProtagonistB looked to be no older than thirteen . ProtagonistB was standing in between ProtagonistA and the old building in which ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's office . ProtagonistB was looking down at the ground , as if ProtagonistB were lost in thought . ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB was okay . ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with tears in ProtagonistB's eyes and said that ProtagonistB was lost . ProtagonistB's parents had died in a car accident and ProtagonistB was all alone in the world . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart break for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB by the hand and led ProtagonistB into ProtagonistA's office . ProtagonistA called the authorities and they took ProtagonistB into their care . ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA always wondered what happened to ProtagonistB and if ProtagonistB was doing okay . 
First came the rumor that ProtagonistA had hired a team of assassins to kill the father of one of ProtagonistA's cousins . This caused quite a stir in the family , and everyone was on edge . ProtagonistA denied it , of course , but no one believed ProtagonistA . Then , ProtagonistB , came forward and said that ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA arranging for a single assassin to do the work . This was the final straw , and ProtagonistA was immediately arrested . The court of coroner ruled that ProtagonistA was guilty of first degree murder , and ProtagonistA was sentenced to life in prison . 
In the year 1447 , the year when Shakespeare became known throughout Europe , the world was in a state of great excitement , when a helian creature , or a celestial being , or one of the pre - existent things , known to men as angels , appeared to speak to ProtagonistA , and to tell ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was destined to be king ; and , further , that ProtagonistA would be the prince of heaven , or lord of heaven , or prince of the whole world , or emperor of the whole earth and the king of men ; and that all the rest of the world was bound to obey ProtagonistA , or else perish ; for , said the angel , I have made the establishment of the kingdom of heaven , or one of the things , for the

One day , while they were walking , they came across a beautiful dress in a shop window . ProtagonistA immediately fell in love with it and begged ProtagonistB to buy it for ProtagonistA . After much pleading , ProtagonistB finally gave in and bought the dress for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was so excited to wear ProtagonistA's new dress that ProtagonistA put it on right away . However , when ProtagonistA went to show ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA realized that the dress was too big for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was able to take the dress back to the store and exchange it for a smaller size . The girls continued to be friends for many years , until ProtagonistB moved away . They kept in touch through letters , and ProtagonistA always cherished the dress that ProtagonistB had bought for ProtagonistA . 
In the year 1250 , the year of the Exodus , ProtagonistB appeared to ProtagonistA on Mount Sinai with a vision , telling ProtagonistA of ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistC would bring ProtagonistC's people to a new land , where they would be free from the tyranny of the Pharaohs . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to tell ProtagonistA's people to be ready , and to follow ProtagonistC when ProtagonistC came . ProtagonistA did as ProtagonistA was told , and when ProtagonistC , led ProtagonistC's people out of Egypt , ProtagonistA was among them . ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistC to the Promised Land , where ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's people live happily to this day . 
ProtagonistA had only ten fingers on each hand , but ProtagonistA was a very good pianist . ProtagonistA started playing when ProtagonistA was four years old and never stopped . ProtagonistA's parents were very supportive and took ProtagonistA to lessons every week . Even though ProtagonistA had a disability , ProtagonistA never let it stop ProtagonistA from doing what ProtagonistA loved . 
ProtagonistA died on a rainy day in 19 , 18 , so ProtagonistA was about 21 when I was born . I never got to meet ProtagonistA , but my mom always told me stories about ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a kind and gentle woman , always quick to help others . ProtagonistA loved the rain , and used to say that it was the tears of the angels . I like to think that ProtagonistA 's watching over me from heaven , and that 's why I always feel comforted when it rains . 
ProtagonistA had always been a headstrong girl , and when ProtagonistA fell in love with ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA's family was less than thrilled . ProtagonistB was a good man , but ProtagonistB came from a poor family and did n't have much to offer ProtagonistA in terms of a future . ProtagonistA's family did everything they could to dissuade ProtagonistA from marrying ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was determined . In the end , ProtagonistA got ProtagonistA's way and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were married . The first few years were tough , as ProtagonistA's family continued to disapprove of ProtagonistA's choice and ProtagonistB struggled to find work that could support them . But they persevered and eventually found happiness together . They had two beautiful children and a life that , while not always easy , was filled with love . 
There was a man in the country , near the village of Mistral , who was a farmer , very much concerned for the welfare of ProtagonistA's own family , and who had some of the best cattle and sheep in the country , and was very fond of ProtagonistA's poultry , and had a good deal of money in ProtagonistA's account , where ProtagonistA could always find a good price for them . One day , however , ProtagonistB found that ProtagonistB's cattle and sheep had all died , and ProtagonistB's poultry had all been stolen . ProtagonistB was very much distressed at this , and went to the village to ask ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA knew anything about it . 
The last time I saw ProtagonistA , on the day when ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA had just had a terrible car accident that had left ProtagonistA in a wheelchair , inscrutable and unidentifiable . I had been at ProtagonistA's bedside for hours , holding ProtagonistA's hand and telling ProtagonistA everything would be alright . But it was n't . ProtagonistA's injuries were too severe , and ProtagonistA passed away early that morning . I never got the chance to say goodbye . 
ProtagonistA knew it was already too late to save the rest of the world . ProtagonistA had seen the signs for years , but ProtagonistA had been in denial . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forgive ProtagonistA for letting it happen . Now , as ProtagonistA looked out at the destruction , ProtagonistA knew there was nothing left to do but try to survive . ProtagonistA would have to find a way to live with the knowledge that ProtagonistA could have saved the world , but did n't . 
ProtagonistA was born in 1246 in a small village in England . ProtagonistA's parents were farmers and ProtagonistA had a happy childhood .

ProtagonistA was happy in ProtagonistA's new home . However , one day , ProtagonistA disappeared and no one knows what happened to ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had been holding ProtagonistA's tongue for far too long . ProtagonistA was tired of being the doormat , the one who always said yes and never complained . Today , ProtagonistA was going to speak ProtagonistA's mind . ProtagonistA started with ProtagonistB . For months , ProtagonistA had been working on a project that was very important to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB kept putting it on the back burner . Today , ProtagonistA went into ProtagonistB's office and told ProtagonistB exactly how ProtagonistA felt . ProtagonistB was surprised , but ProtagonistB listened to ProtagonistA and promised to start giving ProtagonistA's project the attention it deserved . Next , ProtagonistA tackled ProtagonistC . They had been living together for over a year , and ProtagonistA was fed up with ProtagonistC's messy habits . ProtagonistA sat ProtagonistC down and calmly explained how ProtagonistA's mess was affecting ProtagonistA . ProtagonistC was apologetic and promised to do better . Finally , ProtagonistA took on ProtagonistA's parents . ProtagonistA had always been a good daughter , but ProtagonistA was tired of being treated like a child . ProtagonistA sat them down and told them that ProtagonistA was an adult and deserved to be treated as such . They listened , and while they did n't necessarily agree with everything ProtagonistA said , they did start to treat ProtagonistA with more respect . It was the day ProtagonistA finally had the courage to speak ProtagonistA's mind , and it was the best day of ProtagonistA's life . 
ProtagonistA was born into a world of darkness . ProtagonistA was born into a world where ProtagonistA was the only one who could see the light . ProtagonistA was born into a world where ProtagonistA was the only one who could see the beauty . ProtagonistA was born into a world where ProtagonistA was the only one who could see the truth . And ProtagonistA called it ProtagonistA's world . 
ProtagonistA's final report was a depressing one . ProtagonistA had killed eighty - two thousand four hundred and thirty - one Americans , and had left behind a record so depressing that it might have been sufficient even to establish the minimum standard of civilisation for that epoch . Before any novel idea was entertained by any man , as to how to keep the record , ProtagonistA had already set the standard for how depressing a final report could be . 
You 're going see ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 's a big - shot warlord in the Middle East , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of money , and ProtagonistA 's got some big guns , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of bombs , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of guns . But ProtagonistA 's not the only one . There 's ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB 's got just as much money , and ProtagonistB 's got just as many guns , and ProtagonistB 's got just as many bombs . And ProtagonistB 's not afraid to use them . Sooner or later , there 's going to be a big showdown between the two of them , and it 's going to be a bloody one . 
ProtagonistA was on the deck of the great ship , looking up at the sun . The light was so bright against ProtagonistA's face that ProtagonistA had to squint ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA could see the other ships in the fleet , all heading towards the sun . ProtagonistA felt a sense of excitement and anticipation . ProtagonistA was about to witness the most amazing event in the world - the coming of the sun . 
ProtagonistA was always a kind and caring person , but you could really tell how great of a person ProtagonistA was by the way ProtagonistA treated ProtagonistA's wife and children . ProtagonistA was always so patient and loving with them , no matter what they did or how they acted . ProtagonistA was always there for them when they needed ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA always made sure they were happy and comfortable . Even when times were tough , ProtagonistA never wavered in ProtagonistA's love and support for ProtagonistA's family . ProtagonistA was truly an amazing wife and mother , and everyone who knew ProtagonistA could see that . 
ProtagonistA was walking through the narrow streets of Copenhagen , carefully avoiding the worst of the traffic . It was a hot October day , and ProtagonistA was sweating in ProtagonistA's thick wool dress . ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way to the market to buy some bread and cheese for dinner . As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA , also avoiding the traffic . ProtagonistB was tall and thin , with dark hair and piercing blue eyes . ProtagonistA felt a sudden jolt of electricity when their eyes met , and ProtagonistA quickly looked away . ProtagonistA hurried to the market , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest . ProtagonistA had never felt that way before , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA bought ProtagonistA's bread and cheese and hurried home , ProtagonistA's mind racing . Could it be love ? 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who had committed a terrible crime . ProtagonistA was so ashamed of what ProtagonistA had done that ProtagonistA did n't want ProtagonistA's body to be discovered . So , ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's own life . But even in death , ProtagonistA could n't escape ProtagonistA's guilt . It is said that if ProtagonistA's body is discovered anywhere on earth , ProtagonistA will immediately reveal the nature of the crime ProtagonistA had committed . 
ProtagonistA went into the water and sat there , a pale - faced man , taking in the ship before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was so beautiful , ProtagonistB thought , even in the darkness . And then ProtagonistA was gone , leaving ProtagonistB alone in the water . 
In the morning ProtagonistA was asleep , and the roil of ProtagonistA's mind was soothed by a light stream of thought or emotion that it was as if ProtagonistA had drifted off into a dream . ProtagonistA dreamed that ProtagonistA was in a beautiful garden , and the sun was shining down on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt so happy and content in the dream that ProtagonistA never wanted to wake up . 
ProtagonistA's parents had always wanted a daughter . They had two sons , but they wanted a daughter to complete their family . When ProtagonistA came to live with them , they were overjoyed . The first thing ProtagonistA's parents said to ProtagonistA was ,  Welcome home , ProtagonistA . We 're so glad ProtagonistA 're here .  ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA belonged with ProtagonistA's new family . ProtagonistA was happy to finally have a place to call home . 
There was once a boy with a very big , very round face and very large eyes and a very small head , but who was much more important than the rest of the boys in the school , and who had played a very important part in ProtagonistB's life , and whose name was William ; and ProtagonistA was a very good , well - behaved boy , and of a very good family , and in a very good school , and was a very useful and useful growth . ProtagonistA had been one of ProtagonistB's best friends when they were both little , and ProtagonistA had always been there for ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB needed someone . ProtagonistA was the one who had helped ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB was lost in the forest , and ProtagonistA had been the one to comfort ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB was upset . ProtagonistA was always there for ProtagonistB , no matter what . But then , one day , ProtagonistA disappeared . ProtagonistB did n't know where ProtagonistA had gone , or why ProtagonistA had left . ProtagonistB missed ProtagonistA terribly , and ProtagonistB wondered if ProtagonistB would ever see ProtagonistA again . One day , out of the blue , ProtagonistA reappeared . ProtagonistA had been away for years , and ProtagonistA had changed . ProtagonistA was no longer the same boy that ProtagonistB had known . ProtagonistA was taller , and ProtagonistA's face was thinner . ProtagonistA's eyes were different , and ProtagonistA's hair was shorter . ProtagonistA looked like a completely different person . But despite all of these changes , ProtagonistB was still happy to see ProtagonistA . They hugged each other tightly , and they caught up on all that had happened in the years that they had been apart . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had been travelling the world , and that ProtagonistA had seen and done many amazing things . ProtagonistB was amazed at all the stories that ProtagonistA had to tell , and ProtagonistB was happy that ProtagonistA had finally come back to ProtagonistB . Even though ProtagonistA was different , ProtagonistA was still the same old friend that ProtagonistB had always known . And ProtagonistB was glad to have ProtagonistA back in ProtagonistB's life . 
ProtagonistA had always been a creative soul . ProtagonistA loved to express ProtagonistA through art , and ProtagonistA was always looking for new ways to do so . When ProtagonistA was younger , ProtagonistA would often go for walks in the woods near ProtagonistA's home and collect leaves and twigs to use in ProtagonistA's collages . As ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA began to experiment with other mediums , and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA's true passion in painting . ProtagonistA's paintings were unlike anything anyone had ever seen . They were full of life and color , and they told stories that ProtagonistA could tell . People were drawn to ProtagonistA's work , and ProtagonistA quickly gained a following . One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the woods again , collecting materials for ProtagonistA's latest project . As ProtagonistA bent down to pick up a twig , ProtagonistA's fingers brushed against the earth , and ProtagonistA had an idea . ProtagonistA would create a painting using the earth as ProtagonistA's canvas . ProtagonistA spent the next few days collecting mud , rocks , and leaves , and ProtagonistA set to work creating ProtagonistA's masterpiece . When ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistA stepped back to admire ProtagonistA's work . It was unlike anything ProtagonistA had ever created , and ProtagonistA knew that it would make a lasting impression . 
Dorman , a physician , lamented that ProtagonistA's profession had become so irrelevant , and had become so feeble and uncertain , that ProtagonistA no longer felt ProtagonistA bound to contact it with any amount of importance . ProtagonistA had always been interested in the medical field , and had even considered becoming a doctor ProtagonistA at one point . However , ProtagonistA now saw how little impact doctors really had on the world . They were no longer the lifesavers they once were . They were now just people who prescribed pills and gave advice that no one really listened to . ProtagonistA had lost all respect for the profession . 
ProtagonistA had not known the time when ProtagonistA would die , but it was an unpleasant year for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had been worse for it . ProtagonistA had been in and out of the hospital for months , and ProtagonistA's family had been by ProtagonistA's side the whole time . ProtagonistA's husband , children , and grandchildren all loved ProtagonistA very much and did not want to see ProtagonistA go . The day finally came when ProtagonistA passed away . It was a peaceful death , and ProtagonistA was surrounded by ProtagonistA's loved ones . Even though ProtagonistA is gone , ProtagonistA will never be forgotten . ProtagonistA was a strong woman who fought until the very end . 
ProtagonistA was making tea for the family when ProtagonistA was startled to discover that ProtagonistB had gone into labour . ProtagonistA quickly called for an ambulance and ProtagonistB was rushed to the hospital . ProtagonistA was by ProtagonistB's side the whole time , holding ProtagonistB's hand and telling ProtagonistB everything would be alright . In the end , their beautiful baby girl was born healthy and happy . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were so grateful , and they knew that this little girl would change their lives forever . 
I have known ProtagonistA since ProtagonistA was little . ProtagonistA was always a sweet girl , always smiling and always eager to help . When ProtagonistA was five , ProtagonistA helped me bake cookies for the first time . ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's cookies were delicious . ProtagonistA has always been a great friend . ProtagonistA 's always been there for me , whether I needed a shoulder to cry on or someone to laugh with . I know I can always count on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA is now a grown woman with a family of ProtagonistA's own . ProtagonistA 's still the same sweet , caring person ProtagonistA was when ProtagonistA was a little girl .

ProtagonistA had been walking with ProtagonistA's companion for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting tired . ProtagonistA was about to suggest they take a break when ProtagonistA felt something hard and cold touch ProtagonistA's hip . ProtagonistA looked down and saw the blade of a large , black - bladed club strapped to ProtagonistA's companion 's hip . ProtagonistA did n't have the strength to resist the impulse to run away . 
There was once ProtagonistA ; and when ProtagonistA was six , and having already grown into a handsome and somewhat charming boy , and making ProtagonistA happy and prosperous by the exert , ProtagonistA was very much admired by ProtagonistA's friends and acquaintances . One day , while out walking with ProtagonistA's father , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was so struck by ProtagonistA's beauty that ProtagonistB immediately asked ProtagonistA to marry ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA joyfully accepted . 
One afternoon , in the spring of an American year , when the sun filled and the clouds were blue , ProtagonistB hobbled ProtagonistA up the river , and pulled ProtagonistA out of the splashing rose - trees . ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA for some time , and had been struck by ProtagonistA's beauty . ProtagonistA was unlike any woman ProtagonistB had ever seen . ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistB was charming and persistent . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA of ProtagonistB's life on the sea , and of the places ProtagonistB had seen . ProtagonistA was captivated by ProtagonistB's stories , and before long , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA agreeing to go with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to a small inn by the river , and they spent the afternoon talking and drinking wine . ProtagonistA laughed and danced , and ProtagonistA forgot all about ProtagonistA's troubles . For the first time in a long time , ProtagonistA felt truly happy . As the sun began to set , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to stay with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA agreed . ProtagonistA did n't want to leave this magical place , and ProtagonistA did n't want to leave ProtagonistB . So ProtagonistA stayed with ProtagonistB , and they sailed away together to a new life . 
ProtagonistA has worked hard ProtagonistA's entire life to get to where ProtagonistA is now . ProtagonistA 's been through a lot of tough times , but ProtagonistA 's finally made it to ProtagonistA's goal . ProtagonistA 's accomplished everything ProtagonistA 's set out to do , and ProtagonistA 's done it with all ProtagonistA's might . ProtagonistA 's happy and proud of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knows that all ProtagonistA's hard work has paid off . 
ProtagonistA stood upright , staring thoughtfully at the cold , silver plate before ProtagonistA . It had been a long time since ProtagonistA had seen it , and ProtagonistA was not sure if ProtagonistA was ready to face it again . ProtagonistA had tried to forget about it , but the memories kept creeping back up , no matter how hard ProtagonistA tried to push them away . The plate was a reminder of ProtagonistA's past , and of the mistakes ProtagonistA had made . ProtagonistA had been so young and naive back then , and ProtagonistA had paid the price for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had lost everything that ProtagonistA had loved , and ProtagonistA had never been able to forgive ProtagonistA for it . Now , ProtagonistA was staring at the plate again , and ProtagonistA felt the familiar weight of sadness settling on ProtagonistA's heart . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA needed to face ProtagonistA's past , and that ProtagonistA needed to make peace with it . Otherwise , it would always haunt ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and reached for the plate . ProtagonistA was ready to confront ProtagonistA's demons , and to finally put the past to rest . 
ProtagonistA had been using ProtagonistA's hearing to the full when ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been eavesdropping on ProtagonistB's conversations for weeks , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was planning to kill ProtagonistA's mother . ProtagonistA could n't let that happen , so ProtagonistA took matters into ProtagonistA's own hands . ProtagonistA waited until ProtagonistB was in the shower , and ProtagonistA snuck up behind ProtagonistB with a knife . ProtagonistA stabbed ProtagonistB in the back , and ProtagonistB died instantly . ProtagonistA's mother was safe , and ProtagonistA was free . 
It was a cold , wet , snow - packed February day in the last year of the reign of Henry III . , when ProtagonistA died of a fever that , for many years afterward , caused even the most shocked Christians to reckon ProtagonistA blessed . Though ProtagonistA was only seventeen , ProtagonistA had been married for two years , and ProtagonistB was already talking of starting a family . But ProtagonistA's death put a stop to those plans . For days after ProtagonistA's funeral , ProtagonistB could be seen wandering the streets of their small town , aimlessly kicking at the snow and muttering to ProtagonistB . Some said ProtagonistB went mad with grief ; others said ProtagonistB was simply cursed by God . But whatever the reason , ProtagonistB never recovered from ProtagonistA's death , and ProtagonistB died less than a year later . 
ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by stories . ProtagonistA loved the way they could transport you to another world , or teach you something new about the one you already lived in . ProtagonistA had read countless books and seen countless movies , but it was n't until ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA truly understood the power of stories . ProtagonistB , had a way of making even the most mundane events sound like the most exciting adventure . ProtagonistB could make you believe that anything was possible , and that the world was a good place full of possibilities . ProtagonistA was captivated by ProtagonistB's stories , and ProtagonistA began to see the world in a new light . ProtagonistA started to see the potential for magic and wonder in everyday life . ProtagonistA began to tell ProtagonistA's own stories , and ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA had a gift for it . People were drawn to ProtagonistA's stories , and ProtagonistA quickly became known as a master storyteller in ProtagonistA's own right . ProtagonistA continued to learn from ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA pass on ProtagonistA's knowledge to others . ProtagonistA helped people see the beauty and potential in their own lives , and ProtagonistA inspired them to tell their own stories . 
ProtagonistA had just before ProtagonistA turned twenty - three had to endure what had hitherto been tolerable physical pain . It was the kind of pain that made ProtagonistA want to curl up in a ball and cry , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be strong . After all , ProtagonistA had a family to take care of . ProtagonistA's husband was out of work and ProtagonistA's children were still young . ProtagonistA could n't afford to be weak . So , ProtagonistA grit ProtagonistA's teeth and bore the pain , even though every step felt like ProtagonistA was walking on hot coals . Finally , ProtagonistA made it to the doctor 's office , where ProtagonistA was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer . The prognosis was n't good , but ProtagonistA was determined to fight . ProtagonistA had to be strong for ProtagonistA's family . 
By the time ProtagonistA was nine , ProtagonistA was already burning mad . ProtagonistA was mad at ProtagonistA's parents , mad at ProtagonistA's teachers , and mad at the world . ProtagonistA was a gifted child who did n't fit in and ProtagonistA knew it . ProtagonistA was always getting into trouble and ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA was going to show everyone that ProtagonistA was the best and they were all going to regret ever doubting ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had been in a coma for weeks , ever since the car accident . ProtagonistA's family had been told that ProtagonistA was unlikely to ever wake up . But then , one day , ProtagonistA did . The first thing ProtagonistA did when ProtagonistA awoke was to abort the transplant . ProtagonistA could feel the foreign presence inside of ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get it out . ProtagonistA's family was shocked that ProtagonistA was awake , but they did n't know what to say when ProtagonistA told them what ProtagonistA had done . ProtagonistA was still weak from the coma , but ProtagonistA was determined to get better . ProtagonistA knew that the transplant had been a mistake and that ProtagonistA had to get rid of it if ProtagonistA ever wanted to be truly well again . 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was missing something . ProtagonistA had a great life , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like there was something more out there . One day , ProtagonistA decided to go on a journey to find out what that something was . ProtagonistA traveled for a long time , but ProtagonistA never found what ProtagonistA was looking for . Eventually , ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA was never going to find what ProtagonistA was looking for and ProtagonistA turned back around . As ProtagonistA was walking back , ProtagonistA saw a rabbit running by and ProtagonistA followed it . The rabbit led ProtagonistA to a hole and ProtagonistA fell down it . When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a strange place . ProtagonistA saw the rabbit and started to follow it again . The rabbit led ProtagonistA to a castle and ProtagonistA went inside . ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was looking for . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA was looking for something more . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA would never find what ProtagonistA was looking for if ProtagonistA did n't know what it was . ProtagonistA thought about this and ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was looking for love . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA went back home . ProtagonistA was finally able to find what ProtagonistA was missing and ProtagonistA was happy . 
ProtagonistA was a man of extremely high moral character and , although ProtagonistA had the greatest number of notables of every description in the world , besides ProtagonistA's wife and children , was altogether a very poor man . ProtagonistA never complained , but went about ProtagonistA's business with a smile on ProtagonistA's face , always helping others when ProtagonistA could . One day , ProtagonistA was out walking when ProtagonistA came across a wallet lying on the ground . ProtagonistA picked it up and looked inside to see if there was any ID so ProtagonistA could return it to its owner . Instead , ProtagonistA found a large amount of cash . ProtagonistA knew it was n't right to keep the money , but ProtagonistA was so tempted . ProtagonistA could really use the money to help ProtagonistA's family . In the end , ProtagonistA's high moral character won out and ProtagonistA took the wallet to the police station , anonymously turning in the cash . 
Once , when ProtagonistA was only eleven , ProtagonistA became really bored . ProtagonistA had no friends to play with , and ProtagonistA's parents were always busy . ProtagonistA thought about what ProtagonistA could do to make ProtagonistA feel better . ProtagonistA decided to go on an adventure . ProtagonistA went outside and started walking . ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA kept walking . ProtagonistA walked for hours , until it started to get dark . ProtagonistA was getting tired , and ProtagonistA still did n't know where ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA saw a light in the distance and started walking towards it . ProtagonistA got to the light and saw that it was a house . ProtagonistA knocked on the door and a woman answered . The woman was kind and invited ProtagonistA inside . ProtagonistA stayed at the woman 's house for the night . The next day , ProtagonistA walked back home . ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA had gone on an adventure , and ProtagonistA learned that ProtagonistA could always find new things to do when ProtagonistA was bored . 
ProtagonistA was driving back from the library , listening to the end of a lecture when ProtagonistA was startled to find ProtagonistA in the middle of a city . ProtagonistA looked around , confused , until ProtagonistA saw a sign that said  Welcome to Chicago !  ProtagonistA must have taken a wrong turn somewhere . ProtagonistA pulled over to the side of the road to get ProtagonistA's bearings . ProtagonistA was about to call ProtagonistA's husband to ask for directions when ProtagonistA saw a police car pull up behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA rolled down ProtagonistA's window and asked the officer for help . The officer told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA was in the middle of a city and ProtagonistA needed to find ProtagonistA's way out . ProtagonistA thanked the officer and drove off . ProtagonistA was able to find ProtagonistA's way out of the city and back to ProtagonistA's home . 
The night ProtagonistA was arrested , ProtagonistA awoke to find ProtagonistA in a cell with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was just as scared as ProtagonistA was . They both sat in silence for a while , until ProtagonistB finally spoke up . What did ProtagonistA do ?  ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head .  ProtagonistA do n't know . ProtagonistA was just sitting in ProtagonistA's apartment when the police came and took ProtagonistA away . ProtagonistB nodded .  ProtagonistB was at the park with ProtagonistB's friends when the police came and arrested us . They said we were causing a disturbance , but we were n't doing anything . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB continued to talk throughout the night , sharing their stories and their fears . As the sun began to rise , they both knew that they were going to have to face whatever was happening to them . 
ProtagonistA had never known the heart of a woman , and ProtagonistA did not even pretend to be surprised at ProtagonistB's romance . It was , after all , something that ProtagonistA had always suspected . ProtagonistB was a kind and loving woman , but there was something about ProtagonistB that just seemed to cry out for romance . And now , it seemed , ProtagonistB had found it . ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little jealous . ProtagonistA had always wanted to experience the kind of love that ProtagonistB was now enjoying , but it just seemed to elude ProtagonistA . Maybe one day , ProtagonistA thought . Maybe one day ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistA's own romance . But for now , ProtagonistA was content to be ProtagonistB's friend and confidante , and to share in ProtagonistB's happiness . 
ProtagonistA had been planning ProtagonistA's attack on the Montparnasse for weeks . ProtagonistA knew that the only way to destroy the place was to breach the roof and let the explosives ProtagonistA had placed inside do their work . ProtagonistA was prepared for the guards that would try to stop ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was not prepared for the sheer size of the building . It took ProtagonistA's hours to find ProtagonistA's way to the roof , and by the time ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA was exhausted . But ProtagonistA was not going to give up now . ProtagonistA placed the explosives and started the timer , then ran for ProtagonistA's life . The explosion was massive , and the entire building came crashing down . ProtagonistA stood there , triumphantly , as the Montparnasse was destroyed . 
It was on the first of May , in the year 1830 , that ProtagonistA , sitting in ProtagonistA's room at the Oxford , in the house of the Earl of Rosendoll , who was the proprietor of the most luxurious apartments in the city , and who , there being then no people of remarkable riches or distinction in the city , or of any rank whatever , and who were all struck with the envy and favor which prevailed there , exercised the following extraordinary and indeed a most singular power , for it was by means of a little device , employed in France about a hundred years ago , by the name of the trivalent motion or vital force , that ProtagonistA obtained from the presence of objects , either tangible or intangible , that most inconsiderable , and , indeed , that no one , or rather more than few , excepting the courtiers of the court and the nobles and the most important men of state , could possibly have imagined at the time , that any human being , who , such as Carol was , might have a reasonable opportunity of acquiring ProtagonistA's crown . 
This is a tale about a man who was born on the Fourth of July , and who went through the Civil War , and who had a son who was killed in the war , and who , after the death of Alice , became the very object of love , or at least the object of much curiosity and much regret , and who , though never having been able to decide whether ProtagonistA was really Carol 's father or had in fact been married to either mother , still believed , with all the force of ProtagonistA's convictions , that ProtagonistA had been conceived in the womb of one of ProtagonistA's paternal grandparents , and that ProtagonistA had been in the process of becoming a man , in a state in which ProtagonistA had never been before , and in which ProtagonistA had never been very happy . 
ProtagonistA was going to China , but first ProtagonistA was going to see ProtagonistA's mother . ProtagonistA's mother was very excited to see ProtagonistA and had been counting down the days until ProtagonistA arrived . They hugged each other tightly when they finally met . They spent the day catching up on each other 's lives and talking about all the things they wanted to do together . The next day , ProtagonistA left for China , but ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistA's mother ProtagonistA would come back to visit soon . 
ProtagonistA , once remarked that ProtagonistA was inclined either to be a monster , or to be nothing at all . ProtagonistA was n't sure which was worse , to be a monster or to be nothing . To be a monster would mean to be feared and hated by everyone . To be nothing would mean to be invisible and unimportant . Either way , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA would lose . 
On a near - perfect December day in the year 1757 , several hundred years after it had begun , a delegation of strangers landed in Amboise , at the entrance to the great promontory , where the Adroux ringed the top of the high peak , and the promontory with it ; and they were admitted by their hosts , Alice , but they only paid ProtagonistA so much attention , that ProtagonistA had only a vague idea of all the characters ProtagonistA was about to meet ; and , indeed , while ProtagonistA was treating them in this way,—and this author is of opinion that there was some truth in what ProtagonistA said,—they were not amused with ProtagonistA's insolent manner ; but , on the contrary , they were delighted with ProtagonistA's singularities of speech — such an art of speaking , in fact , that ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's voice ; it was already a source of amusement for the officers , and enabled them to strike a most interesting combination of tones — a very singular effect , in fact — and by a few degrees of improvement , the inmates of the gallery were very much amused , and , in consequence , were easily prevailed on to entertain and produce entertainments , of a like character , in the austere and rigid laws of the Colony . 
ProtagonistA had been reading aloud from the ' History of the United States of America ' when ProtagonistA noticed a word in a Latin text on the back page . The word was ' expedition . ' ProtagonistA was curious about what an expedition was , so ProtagonistA looked it up in the dictionary . ProtagonistA read that an expedition is a journey made for a specific purpose , such as exploration or conquest . ProtagonistA was fascinated by the idea of going on an expedition and started to daydream about what it would be like . 
ProtagonistA approached the throne upon an armchair not as a king , but as a dandy . ProtagonistA was a success , but no more than a short - cut , with ProtagonistB at full term . ProtagonistA sat down to lunch , and took a stool in the sofas on the other side of the table . ProtagonistB eyed ProtagonistA with a look of amusement .  ProtagonistA are not what ProtagonistB expected ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB expected someone more ... regal .   ProtagonistA am who ProtagonistA am ,  ProtagonistA said with a shrug .  And ProtagonistA 'm not here to impress ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA 'm here to get something done .  ProtagonistB leaned back in ProtagonistB's chair and regarded ProtagonistA for a moment .  And what is it that ProtagonistA want , ProtagonistA ?   ProtagonistA want ProtagonistB to sign this treaty ,  ProtagonistA said , pulling a document out of ProtagonistA's pocket and sliding it across the table .  It 's a simple trade agreement . Nothing more , nothing less .  ProtagonistB looked at the document , then back at ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA 're very straightforward , are n't ProtagonistA ?   ProtagonistA try to be ,  ProtagonistA said .  It saves time .  ProtagonistB signed the document , then pushed it back across the table to ProtagonistA .  There ProtagonistA go ,  ProtagonistB said .  Now , what was it ProtagonistA wanted to ask ProtagonistB ?   Oh , nothing ,  ProtagonistA said , getting to ProtagonistA's feet .  ProtagonistA just wanted to make sure ProtagonistB were still alive . ProtagonistA 'll be on ProtagonistA's way now .  ProtagonistB stared at ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA walked away , then shook ProtagonistB's head and went back to ProtagonistB's lunch . 
ProtagonistA was a kind and gentle woman who lived a simple life . ProtagonistA was content with what ProtagonistA had and did n't want for anything more . However , fate had other plans for ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA came across a group of men who were about to kill a deer . ProtagonistA begged them to stop and let the deer go , but they would n't listen . They turned on ProtagonistA and would have killed ProtagonistA too if ProtagonistA had n't run away . ProtagonistA was terrified and ran as fast as ProtagonistA could . ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA had to get away . Suddenly , ProtagonistA came across a small cottage . ProtagonistA went inside and hid under the bed . The men came into the cottage , but they could n't find ProtagonistA . They left , and ProtagonistA was safe . From then on , ProtagonistA made it ProtagonistA's mission to help animals in need . ProtagonistA became a famous animal rights activist and helped make the world a better place . ProtagonistA lived a long and happy life , and died a free woman . 
ProtagonistA was never supposed to be alive . ProtagonistA was born premature and doctors said ProtagonistA would n't make it through the night . But ProtagonistA was a fighter . ProtagonistA fought and ProtagonistA fought and ProtagonistA fought until ProtagonistA finally took ProtagonistA's first breath . The doctors were amazed that ProtagonistA was alive and even more amazed that ProtagonistA was healthy . ProtagonistA went on to live a long and happy life . ProtagonistA was always grateful to be alive and always tried to help others who were fighting for their lives . 
ProtagonistA was only six years old when ProtagonistB left for the first time . ProtagonistA did n't understand why ProtagonistB had to go and why ProtagonistB could n't take ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB . All ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistB was going to be gone for a while and ProtagonistA would have to stay with ProtagonistC . The first winter was the hardest . ProtagonistA would often cry ProtagonistA to sleep at night , wondering where ProtagonistB was and if ProtagonistB was ever coming back . ProtagonistA would see other families out and about , playing in the snow and having snowball fights , and ProtagonistA would feel so alone . One day , ProtagonistC sat ProtagonistA down and explained that ProtagonistB was doing important work and that ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA very much . ProtagonistC also said that ProtagonistB would be back soon . From then on , ProtagonistA started to feel a bit better . ProtagonistA still missed ProtagonistB terribly but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was doing something important . The next winter , ProtagonistA was excited to see ProtagonistB again and give ProtagonistB a big hug . 
ProtagonistA did n't share a room with your mom or ProtagonistB or any of that stuff that everybody does . said ProtagonistA , turning ProtagonistA's chair around to face the floor . ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's own room , and ProtagonistA loved it . It was ProtagonistA's own little space where ProtagonistA could be alone and think and read and write . It was perfect . But one day , everything changed . ProtagonistA's parents got a divorce , and ProtagonistA had to move in with ProtagonistB . Suddenly , ProtagonistA did n't have ProtagonistA's own space anymore . ProtagonistA had to share a room with ProtagonistB , and it was awful . ProtagonistB was always there , always making noise , always bothering ProtagonistA . It was torture . But ProtagonistA did n't give up . ProtagonistA kept fighting for ProtagonistA's own space , and eventually , ProtagonistA won . ProtagonistA got ProtagonistA's own room back , and ProtagonistA was happier than ever . 
ProtagonistA lay in ProtagonistA's white cotton dress , looking out through the bars at the stars overhead , and ProtagonistB ; and all the life of the world was passing before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had been in prison for so long , ProtagonistA could not remember how it had happened . ProtagonistA only knew that ProtagonistA was innocent , and that no one would believe ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had given up hope of ever getting out , until one day , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA's cell . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had been praying for ProtagonistA , and that ProtagonistB believed ProtagonistA's innocence . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would do everything ProtagonistB could to help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB's help was not enough , and ProtagonistA was executed . As ProtagonistA lay on the ground , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing over ProtagonistA , weeping . ProtagonistA forgave ProtagonistB , and died with a smile on ProtagonistA's face . 
ProtagonistA stands on ProtagonistA's brook and watches the sun set over a wide and blue sea of gold . ProtagonistA thinks about ProtagonistA's life and how it 's been so good to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 's been blessed with a wonderful family , great friends , and a job that ProtagonistA loves . ProtagonistA 's thankful for all the good things in ProtagonistA's life and knows that there are more good things to come . 
ProtagonistA , sitting behind the cover of Rarity 's bedroom , ProtagonistA's eyes riveted on the wide - angled porthole , was thinking about the stories ProtagonistA 'd heard about the city , very similar to Boston . ProtagonistA had always wanted to visit , but never had the chance . Now , ProtagonistA was finally here , and it was everything ProtagonistA 'd hoped for . The sights , the sounds , the smells ... it was all so new and exciting . ProtagonistA could hardly wait to explore more of the city . 
ProtagonistA had forgotten how long ProtagonistA 'd been in the desert . ProtagonistA remembered the last time ProtagonistA had seen water was when ProtagonistA was with ProtagonistA's family . They had been on a hike , and ProtagonistA had wandered off the trail . When ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's way back , they were gone . ProtagonistA had been searching for them for days , and ProtagonistA's water had run out a long time ago . ProtagonistA was so thirsty , and ProtagonistA's throat was so dry . ProtagonistA had been walking for what felt like forever , and ProtagonistA was starting to lose hope . Suddenly , ProtagonistA saw something in the distance . It was a mirage , ProtagonistA was sure of it . But as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized it was real . There was a oasis , and ProtagonistA ran to it . ProtagonistA fell to ProtagonistA's knees and drank from the cool water . ProtagonistA had never been so relieved , and ProtagonistA thanked God for leading ProtagonistA to safety . 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the foot of a large tree in the shadow of an old oak tree , spreading ProtagonistA's wings . ProtagonistA was enjoying the warmth of the sun on ProtagonistA's feathers when ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes . ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's head to see a small rabbit step out into the clearing . The rabbit saw ProtagonistA and froze , its eyes wide in fear . ProtagonistA spread ProtagonistA's wings and flew at the rabbit , grabbing it in ProtagonistA's talons . ProtagonistA flew up into the tree and perched on a branch , eating ProtagonistA's lunch . 
ProtagonistA laid ProtagonistA's hooves on ProtagonistA's forelegs and stared up at the sky . ProtagonistA had never seen anything so beautiful . The stars were shining so brightly and the moon was so big . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could reach up and touch it . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could stay there forever and just look at the sky . 
ProtagonistA can not be quite sure which was which , but ProtagonistA had seen the end of it . The two possible outcomes had played out in ProtagonistA's head so many times that ProtagonistA was exhausted . In the end , ProtagonistA chose the one that seemed the most logical , the one that would keep ProtagonistA safe . ProtagonistA turned away from the other option , the one that would have been so much easier , and walked away . 
ProtagonistA reached over to cup ProtagonistA's eyes to see just how dry and teary ProtagonistA's eyes were . ProtagonistA was surprised to find that they were actually quite dry , though ProtagonistA's tears had certainly made them wet . ProtagonistA wiped them away with ProtagonistA's sleeve and stood up , blinking in the bright sunlight . It was time to get moving again . 
ProtagonistA stretched out ProtagonistA's forelegs and rested ProtagonistA's hind legs on the side of ProtagonistA's neck . ProtagonistA was getting a bit tired from all the running around ProtagonistA had been doing lately . It seemed like every day there was something new to explore and ProtagonistA just could n't keep up . As ProtagonistA rested , ProtagonistA thought about all the places ProtagonistA had been and all the things ProtagonistA had seen . ProtagonistA had made so many new friends along the way and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never get bored . After a little while , ProtagonistA got up and stretched ProtagonistA's legs before continuing on ProtagonistA's way . 
ProtagonistA had been walking in the forest for hours , and ProtagonistA was starting to get tired . ProtagonistA had been following ProtagonistB , hoping that ProtagonistB would lead ProtagonistA back home . But ProtagonistB had led ProtagonistA deeper and deeper into the forest , until ProtagonistA was completely lost . ProtagonistA sat down on a log to rest , and ProtagonistA soon fell asleep . When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB was gone . ProtagonistA got up and started walking around , trying to find ProtagonistA's way out of the forest . But ProtagonistA only got more and more lost . ProtagonistA started to cry , and ProtagonistA sat down on the ground , feeling hopeless . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistA looked up and saw ProtagonistB , standing at the edge of the forest . ProtagonistB beckoned ProtagonistA to follow ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA out of the forest and back to ProtagonistA's home . ProtagonistA was so grateful to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA hugged ProtagonistB and thanked ProtagonistB for finding ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA vowed to never go into the forest again , and ProtagonistA never did . 
ProtagonistA had always dreamed of a rainbow , whenever nopony was around to explain it to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA would often lie on ProtagonistA back in the meadow and stare up at the sky , dreaming of the colors dancing in the sky . One day , ProtagonistA saw a real rainbow for the first time . ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA ran to tell ProtagonistA's friends . They were all amazed and wanted to know how ProtagonistA had seen it . ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA had just been dreaming and that they should all close their eyes and dream of rainbows too . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches , staring into the distance . ProtagonistA could see the smoke rising from the chimneys of the village and hear the sound of the children playing . It was a peaceful scene , but something was wrong . ProtagonistA could n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but ProtagonistA knew something was amiss . ProtagonistA stood up and began to walk towards the village . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that the houses were in disrepair and the people were thin and ragged . It was as if the life had been sucked out of the village . As ProtagonistA walked through the village , ProtagonistA saw that the people were listless and apathetic . They did n't even seem to notice ProtagonistA . It was as if they had given up hope . ProtagonistA felt a deep sadness for these people . ProtagonistA did n't know what had happened to them , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to help . ProtagonistA went from house to house , doing what ProtagonistA could to help . ProtagonistA repaired roofs , cooked meals , and tended to the sick . Slowly , but surely , the village began to come back to life . The people became more active and engaged . They began to take pride in their homes and their community . ProtagonistA had made a difference . ProtagonistA had given these people hope . And that was the most important thing of all . 
ProtagonistA was having a tough day . ProtagonistA had been up since the sun rose , and now it was well past noon . ProtagonistA was exhausted , and all ProtagonistA wanted to do was take a nap . But ProtagonistA had to keep going . ProtagonistA had responsibilities . ProtagonistA had to take care of the animals . ProtagonistA trudged through the barn , doing ProtagonistA best to take care of the animals . But ProtagonistA was so tired , ProtagonistA could barely keep ProtagonistA's eyes open . Finally , ProtagonistA made it to the cooler . ProtagonistA lay down on the floor , propping ProtagonistB's ears up and putting ProtagonistB's hooves on ProtagonistB's head . ProtagonistA was just going to rest for a few minutes . ProtagonistA was n't going to fall asleep . But ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA was jolted awake by the sound of the barn door opening . ProtagonistA sat up , wide - eyed , as ProtagonistA saw a figure silhouetted in the doorway . Who 's there ?  ProtagonistA called out , ProtagonistA's voice shaking . There was no answer . ProtagonistA's heart was pounding in ProtagonistA's chest . ProtagonistA was terrified . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . Then , ProtagonistA heard a voice . It was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA , it 's ProtagonistB ,  the voice said . ProtagonistA relaxed . ProtagonistA was relieved . It was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB scared ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said .  What are ProtagonistB doing here?I came to check on ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA go into the cooler , and ProtagonistB was worried about ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA smiled .  Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA appreciate it . But ProtagonistA 'm fine . ProtagonistA was just taking a quick nap . Okay ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'll let ProtagonistA get back to ProtagonistA's nap then . ProtagonistA lay down and closed ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA was safe now . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would always be there to look out for ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's own set of sparrow feet . ProtagonistA loved them and was always excited to show them off . One day , ProtagonistA was playing in ProtagonistA's backyard when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking by . ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB and asked if ProtagonistB wanted to see ProtagonistA's feet . ProtagonistB said yes , so ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's feet . ProtagonistB was amazed and said they were the most beautiful feet ProtagonistB had ever seen . 
ProtagonistA was getting frustrated . ProtagonistA had been trying to get ProtagonistA's stork to fly for hours now and it just was n't working .  Now , now , all right ?  said ProtagonistA , shaking ProtagonistA's stork .  You have to fly . ProtagonistA know you can do it .  But the stork just looked at ProtagonistA , not moving a muscle . ProtagonistA sighed . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a voice .  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA have to believe in ProtagonistA . If ProtagonistA do n't believe ProtagonistA can fly , then ProtagonistA never will .  It was the stork speaking to ProtagonistA .  But ProtagonistA do believe ,  said ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA just do n't know how .   That 's the thing , ProtagonistA ,  said the stork .  ProtagonistA have to find a way to fly from the inside . Once ProtagonistA do that , the rest will be easy .  With that , the stork took off into the sky , leaving ProtagonistA behind . But ProtagonistA was determined . ProtagonistA was going to find a way to fly . And ProtagonistA did . 
One day ProtagonistA's father sent ProtagonistA to live with ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle . ProtagonistA was very excited to go and live with them . When ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle were very strict . They did n't allow ProtagonistA to do anything fun . ProtagonistA had to stay in ProtagonistA's room all day and could n't go outside . ProtagonistA was very bored and unhappy . One day , ProtagonistA decided to run away .

When ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistB denied it at first . But eventually ProtagonistB confessed . ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB was sorry and that ProtagonistB did n't know why ProtagonistB did it . ProtagonistA forgave ProtagonistB and they remained close cousins . 
ProtagonistA was sitting on ProtagonistA's bed , knitting a sweater for Applejack of the Rainbow Dash . ProtagonistA was thinking about how much ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's two friends and how they were always there for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew that they would love the sweater , but ProtagonistA also knew that they would never ask for it . ProtagonistA wanted to make something special for them , something that they could cherish forever . ProtagonistA finished the sweater and held it up to the light . It was perfect . ProtagonistA could n't wait to give it to ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA knew they would be surprised , but ProtagonistA also knew they would be happy . ProtagonistA could n't wait to see the looks on their faces when they opened the gift . 
ProtagonistA was a happy child , always smiling and laughing . ProtagonistA was the light in ProtagonistA's parents ' lives and they cherished ProtagonistA every moment . However , they knew that one day ProtagonistA would grow up and leave them . They did n't want ProtagonistA to go , but they knew ProtagonistA had to . One day , ProtagonistA came to ProtagonistA's parents and said ProtagonistA wanted to leave . They were heartbroken , but they knew it was for the best . They hugged ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA how much they loved ProtagonistA . They also told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA would always be a part of their family , no matter what . ProtagonistA left home and started ProtagonistA's own life . ProtagonistA was happy , but ProtagonistA always missed ProtagonistA's parents . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving forward , but ProtagonistA was always grateful for the time ProtagonistA had with them . 
ProtagonistA looked down at the floor of ProtagonistA's hooves , at ProtagonistA's feet , and the strands of pink hair hanging above ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA was a little girl , no more than four years old , and ProtagonistA was lost . ProtagonistA had been following a white rabbit down a hole , and now ProtagonistA was in some kind of underground tunnel . The only light came from a glowing orb that floated above ProtagonistA's head , and ProtagonistA was getting very tired . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard voices . They were coming from ahead of ProtagonistA , and they sounded like they were arguing . ProtagonistA began to follow the voices , and soon ProtagonistA came to a small opening in the wall . ProtagonistA peered through , and saw two creatures that ProtagonistA had never seen before . They were both about the same size as ProtagonistA , and they had long ears and furry tails . The creatures were arguing about something , and ProtagonistA could n't understand what they were saying . But ProtagonistA was too tired to care , and so ProtagonistA lay down and fell asleep . 
ProtagonistA was sitting cross - legged on the edge of the porch , ProtagonistA's eyes fixed on the tree closest to ProtagonistA . It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining down on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt at peace with the world . ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approach . ProtagonistA ?  a voice said . ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB , standing there .  Yes ?  ProtagonistA said . I was just wondering what ProtagonistA were thinking about ,  ProtagonistB said . Oh , just about life in general ,  ProtagonistA said .  It 's so beautiful out here . Yes , it is ,  ProtagonistB said , coming to sit beside ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB 'm glad ProtagonistA 're enjoying it . They sat there together , enjoying the peace and quiet of the day . 
ProtagonistA peered down through the low ceiling of ProtagonistA's office as though ProtagonistA had been watching a war for hours . ProtagonistA had seen the fighting begin early that morning , and ProtagonistA had been glued to ProtagonistA's spot ever since . The noise of the guns and the screams of the wounded echoed in ProtagonistA's ears , and the smoke from the fires burned ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA was exhausted , but ProtagonistA could n't tear ProtagonistA away from the scene . This was the worst fighting ProtagonistA had ever seen , and ProtagonistA was afraid that it would only get worse . 
ProtagonistA stared at the floor , ProtagonistA's eyes darting from one simple idea to another . ProtagonistA was trying to think of a way to get out of the situation ProtagonistA was in , but nothing was coming to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had been in this room for hours , with no food or water , and ProtagonistA was starting to get desperate . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a key in the door and ProtagonistA quickly stood up , hoping that someone had come to rescue ProtagonistA . But when the door opened , ProtagonistA saw that it was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB came into the room and stared at ProtagonistA , a cruel smile on ProtagonistB's face .  ProtagonistB see ProtagonistA 're still here ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'm sorry to say that ProtagonistA's rescue is not coming . No one knows ProtagonistA 're here , and no one ever will . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart sink as ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was going to die in this room . ProtagonistA tried to think of something , anything , that could help ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was coming up blank . ProtagonistB came closer to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA backed away until ProtagonistA was against the wall . ProtagonistB grabbed ProtagonistA by the throat and started to choke ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA struggled to breathe , ProtagonistA's eyes wide with fear . ProtagonistA knew that this was the end , and there was nothing ProtagonistA could do to stop it . 
ProtagonistA was sitting on Alice 's book , the one ProtagonistA 'd always been short on . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should n't be reading it , but ProtagonistA could n't help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was transfixed by the story of Alice 's adventures in Wonderland . ProtagonistA had always wanted to visit Wonderland ProtagonistA , and now ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was finally getting ProtagonistA's chance . ProtagonistA turned the page eagerly , eager to see what would happen next . 
ProtagonistA stood up on ProtagonistA's hooves , and pulled ProtagonistA's head back with one hoof . ProtagonistA looked around at the other horses in the field , and then ProtagonistA started to run . ProtagonistA ran as fast as ProtagonistA could , and ProtagonistA did n't stop until ProtagonistA reached the other side of the field . 
ProtagonistA remembered when ProtagonistA started at Equestria . ProtagonistA was a young filly , and ProtagonistA was so excited to be there . ProtagonistA met all of the other ponies , and ProtagonistA made new friends . ProtagonistA loved going on adventures with ProtagonistA's new friends , and ProtagonistA loved learning new things . ProtagonistA was happy at Equestria , and ProtagonistA loved it there . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked out at the moon . It was a beautiful night , and ProtagonistA felt so lucky to be alive . ProtagonistA thought about all the things ProtagonistA wanted to do and see in ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA felt like anything was possible . ProtagonistA was going to make the most of every moment , and ProtagonistA was never going to give up on ProtagonistA's dreams . 
ProtagonistA lay down on ProtagonistA's hooves and reached for ProtagonistA's glass of juice . ProtagonistA was exhausted from a long day of work and just wanted to relax . ProtagonistA sipped ProtagonistA's juice and closed ProtagonistA's eyes , letting the cool liquid refresh ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA let out a contented sigh and allowed ProtagonistA to drift off to sleep . 
It was that rainy morning in July , that ProtagonistA was watching over ProtagonistA's new house . ProtagonistA had just moved in the week before , and was still getting used to the sound of the rain on the roof . ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's chair , looking out the window at the rain , when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking down the street . ProtagonistA could n't tell who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistB seemed to be coming towards ProtagonistA's house . As ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was a woman , and ProtagonistB was carrying a suitcase . ProtagonistB came up to the house and knocked on the door . ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA's new neighbor . ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB was moving into the house next door , and ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA moving in and wanted to welcome ProtagonistA to the neighborhood . They talked for a while , and ProtagonistA invited ProtagonistB in for some coffee . They became friends , and ProtagonistA was glad to have a neighbor ProtagonistA could talk to . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches , contemplating ProtagonistA's drawing card . ProtagonistA had been working on it for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally satisfied with the result . It was a beautiful portrait of ProtagonistA's cat , Snickers . ProtagonistA had captured the cat 's personality perfectly , and ProtagonistA was sure that everyone who saw it would love it . Now , ProtagonistA just had to find the perfect frame for it . ProtagonistA wanted something that would really make the picture pop , and ProtagonistA was confident that ProtagonistA would find it . After all , ProtagonistA had been an artist for as long as ProtagonistA could remember , and ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA was doing . As ProtagonistA walked through the store , ProtagonistA found the perfect frame . It was simple , but it was also elegant , and it would showcase ProtagonistA's cat 's portrait perfectly . ProtagonistA could n't wait to get it home and put it on display . 
ProtagonistA had been having trouble sleeping for weeks . ProtagonistA would lie in bed for hours , tossing and turning , trying to will ProtagonistA to fall asleep . But as soon as ProtagonistA would start to drift off , ProtagonistA's mind would start racing and ProtagonistA would be wide awake again . Tonight was no different . ProtagonistA had been lying in bed for hours , staring at the ceiling , when ProtagonistA noticed that the moon had stopped shining . ProtagonistA found this odd , but not entirely unexpected . After all , ProtagonistA had been having trouble sleeping for weeks . Maybe the moon was just taking a break . ProtagonistA tried to go back to sleep , but ProtagonistA's mind was now racing even more than before . ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to the window to see if the moon was still there . But it was gone . ProtagonistA looked around , but there was no sign of it anywhere . ProtagonistA was about to go back to bed when ProtagonistA heard a noise outside . ProtagonistA looked out the window and saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA's house . ProtagonistA was about to call out to ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA noticed that ProtagonistB was carrying a large sack . ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB walked up to ProtagonistA's house and disappeared inside . ProtagonistA was about to go downstairs to see what was going on when ProtagonistA heard a voice . It was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was inside ProtagonistA's house .  ProtagonistB 've come for the moon ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB know ProtagonistA have it . Give it to ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA was confused . ProtagonistA did n't have the moon . But before ProtagonistA could say anything , ProtagonistB had pulled out a gun and pointed it at ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB do n't want to hurt ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  Just give ProtagonistB the moon .  ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA was about to give ProtagonistB the moon when ProtagonistA heard a noise from upstairs . It was the sound of someone moving around . ProtagonistB heard it too . ProtagonistB turned and ran out of the house . ProtagonistA ran upstairs to see what the noise was . ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's cat , Mr. Snuggles , sleeping on ProtagonistA's bed . ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief and went back to bed . But ProtagonistA could n't sleep . ProtagonistA was too confused about what had just happened . Had ProtagonistA really seen the moon disappear ? And who was ProtagonistB ? ProtagonistA would find out soon enough . 
ProtagonistA was lying in a pool of ProtagonistA's own blood , feeling the life slowly draining out of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was n't going to make it . As ProtagonistA lay there , ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's life and all the things ProtagonistA had done . ProtagonistA was happy with the life ProtagonistA had lived , and ProtagonistA was at peace knowing that ProtagonistA had done everything ProtagonistA wanted to do . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let go . 
ProtagonistB was a beautiful mare , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly . However , one day , while they were out grazing in the pasture , ProtagonistB suddenly began to spin in circles , ProtagonistB's eyes wide in alarm . ProtagonistB's hooves shook in the darkness , and ProtagonistA knew something was wrong . ProtagonistA tried to help ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't get ProtagonistB to stop spinning . Eventually , ProtagonistB collapsed , and ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB was dead . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do without ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA stayed by ProtagonistB's side for a long time , until finally ProtagonistA had to go on without ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA always remembered the day ProtagonistB died . It was a day that changed ProtagonistA's life forever . 
One day , while watching ProtagonistA's blank expression as it was reflected in a mirror , ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA quite liked it quite a bit . How was ProtagonistA going to wear it without looking like an idiot ! ProtagonistA decided to try it out on ProtagonistA's next date with ProtagonistB . When ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA could tell ProtagonistB was taken aback by ProtagonistA's appearance . ProtagonistB stammered and said ,  ProtagonistA look ... different .  ProtagonistA just smiled and said ,  ProtagonistA know , is n't it great ?  ProtagonistB did n't know what to say , so ProtagonistB just smiled and nodded . Throughout the date , ProtagonistA could tell ProtagonistB was uncomfortable , but ProtagonistA did n't mind . ProtagonistA was having a great time . At the end of the date , ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB had a great time , but ProtagonistB think ProtagonistB 'm going to need some time to get used to ProtagonistA's new look .  ProtagonistA just laughed and said ,  That 's fine , ProtagonistA 'm not going anywhere .  
ProtagonistA leaned over the balcony of ProtagonistA's apartment , gazing at the seemingly endless blue sky . In ProtagonistA's opinion , it was filled with the most beautiful white foals . ProtagonistA sighed contently , taking in the scene before ProtagonistA . It was a peaceful moment , one that ProtagonistA cherished . 
ProtagonistA swallowed a large melty gulp of ProtagonistA's new favorite drink which was no doubt ProtagonistA's seventh . The drink was a bright pink and tasted like strawberries . It was ProtagonistA's new favorite and ProtagonistA loved it . ProtagonistA had been drinking it all day and was feeling a bit buzzed . ProtagonistA was sitting on ProtagonistA's porch swing , swaying back and forth , when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking by . ProtagonistB stopped and looked at ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 're looking a bit flushed . Are ProtagonistA feeling alright ?  ProtagonistB asked .  ProtagonistA 'm fine ,  ProtagonistA replied ,  ProtagonistA just love this new drink .  ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head and said ,  ProtagonistA should lay off the alcohol . It 's not good for ProtagonistA .  And with that , ProtagonistB walked away . ProtagonistA thought about what ProtagonistB said and decided maybe ProtagonistB was right . ProtagonistA got up from the swing and went inside to pour ProtagonistA a glass of water . 
For as long as ProtagonistA could remember , ProtagonistB had been the only person ProtagonistA knew who had ever understood ProtagonistA's whole personality better . Even when ProtagonistA was a little girl and would get upset about something , ProtagonistB would always know how to make ProtagonistA feel better . ProtagonistB was the one person ProtagonistA could always count on , no matter what . So when ProtagonistB passed away suddenly , ProtagonistA was absolutely devastated . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to get through it . But with the support of ProtagonistA's family and friends , ProtagonistA slowly started to heal . And although ProtagonistA still misses ProtagonistB every day , ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistB will always be with ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's heart . 
ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes . ProtagonistA's sister had been pacing the downstairs hallway for hours , still staring up at the giant dragon sitting on the doorstep . ProtagonistA had tried to get ProtagonistA to come upstairs and take a break , but ProtagonistA refused . ProtagonistA was determined to figure out how to get rid of the dragon . Finally , after hours of pacing , ProtagonistA had an idea . ProtagonistA went upstairs and got a cupcake . Then ProtagonistA walked back downstairs and held it out to the dragon . The dragon sniffed the cupcake and then ate it in one bite . Then it licked its lips and seemed to smile . After that , the dragon went away and ProtagonistA was able to go back to ProtagonistA's normal life . ProtagonistA never forgot the day when ProtagonistA outsmarted a dragon with a cupcake . 
ProtagonistA was working at a dress shop when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB working there . ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB was cute and ProtagonistA started to talk to ProtagonistB . They became friends and started dating . They got married a few years later and had two kids . They were happy together until ProtagonistB died of a heart attack . ProtagonistA was left to raise their kids on ProtagonistA's own . 
ProtagonistA waited patiently at the top of the mountain for ProtagonistA's sister . ProtagonistA knew that it would take ProtagonistA some time to make the climb , but ProtagonistA was patient . ProtagonistA was rewarded for ProtagonistA's patience when ProtagonistA's sister finally arrived .  I 'm so sorry it took me so long ,  ProtagonistA's sister said .  I got lost a few times .   That 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm just glad you made it .  The sisters hugged each other tightly , enjoying the view from the top of the mountain . 
ProtagonistA , through the thickets of underbrush , through the smog , through the deep dark , lay in the dimness of ProtagonistB's chambers , ProtagonistA's head on ProtagonistA's hooves . ProtagonistA was tired from ProtagonistA's journey and wanted to rest , but ProtagonistA could not . ProtagonistA was too excited to see ProtagonistB again . ProtagonistA had not seen ProtagonistB in years , not since ProtagonistA had left for college . ProtagonistA remembered ProtagonistB as a kind and gentle girl , always ready to help others . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would be able to help ProtagonistA now . ProtagonistA stood up and began to pace . ProtagonistA was too keyed up to sit still . ProtagonistA peered out of the window , trying to see ProtagonistB's house in the distance . ProtagonistA could not see it , but ProtagonistA knew it was there . ProtagonistA was so close , ProtagonistA could almost feel ProtagonistB's presence . ProtagonistA began to trot in place , ProtagonistA's hooves making soft thumping sounds on the floor . ProtagonistA was getting impatient . Finally , ProtagonistA heard footsteps outside the door . ProtagonistA froze , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest . The door opened and ProtagonistB walked in . ProtagonistB was just as ProtagonistA remembered ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was wearing a simple dress and ProtagonistB's hair was pulled back in a loose ponytail . ProtagonistB looked tired , but ProtagonistB's eyes lit up when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA . Rainbow Dash ! ProtagonistB ca n't believe ProtagonistA 're here !  ProtagonistB exclaimed . ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB's help ,  ProtagonistA said urgently .  ProtagonistA do n't know what to do . What 's wrong ?  ProtagonistB asked , concern creasing ProtagonistB's brow . It 's ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC 's in trouble and ProtagonistA do n't know how to help ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA was hoping ProtagonistB could help ProtagonistA . Of course , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB 'll do whatever ProtagonistB can . ProtagonistB sat down and listened as ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistC's problems . ProtagonistA was worried about ProtagonistC and wanted to help , but ProtagonistA did not know how . ProtagonistA was relieved when ProtagonistB offered to help . Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could count on ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said . It 's no problem , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB 'm happy to help . Now , let 's see what we can do for ProtagonistC .  
One morning , ProtagonistA woke up in the middle of the night , and there was a pony standing over ProtagonistA . The pony was white with a black mane and tail , and it was looking at ProtagonistA with its big , brown eyes . ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . Then the pony spoke to ProtagonistA .  Hello , ProtagonistA . I 'm here to take ProtagonistA on an adventure .  ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA jumped out of bed and followed the pony out of ProtagonistA's house . They went on a magical journey through the woods and came to a beautiful castle . The pony turned to ProtagonistA and said ,  This is ProtagonistA's adventure , ProtagonistA . What are ProtagonistA going to do ?  ProtagonistA thought for a moment and then said ,  ProtagonistA 'm going to explore the castle !  So ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA found secret passages and hidden rooms , and ProtagonistA even met a friendly dragon . In the end , ProtagonistA had the best adventure ever . 
ProtagonistA lay down on ProtagonistA's hooves and reached for ProtagonistA's glass of juice . ProtagonistA was tired from a long day of work and wanted to relax . ProtagonistA sipped ProtagonistA's juice and closed ProtagonistA's eyes , letting the cool liquid refresh ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA thought about her day and all the things ProtagonistA had to do . ProtagonistA was glad to be able to relax now and just enjoy the moment . 
ProtagonistA bent down and peered up into the oak tree that sheltered ProtagonistA from the wind . It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining down through the leaves , making them glow in a million different shades of green . ProtagonistA felt so happy and peaceful in this moment , ProtagonistA wanted to stay here forever . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's heels on the edge of a wide open field and peered down into the quiet green valley below . It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining down on the peaceful scene . ProtagonistA felt a sense of calm come over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA looked at the valley . ProtagonistA could see a small stream winding its way through the grass , and the trees were just starting to turn green . ProtagonistA felt a sense of joy as ProtagonistA sat there and soaked in the beauty of the scene . 
ProtagonistA looked up at the sun , and wondered if ProtagonistA wanted to leave the Equestrian capital anytime soon . ProtagonistA had been living in the city for a while , and it was starting to feel a bit stifling . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's friends and ProtagonistA's life here , but sometimes ProtagonistA just wanted to get away from it all . Maybe ProtagonistA would take a trip out to the countryside sometime soon . It had been a while since ProtagonistA 'd been able to just relax and enjoy nature . ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA's friends would understand if ProtagonistA took a few days to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA smiled and decided that , yes , a trip was definitely in order . ProtagonistA would start making plans tomorrow . For now , ProtagonistA was just going to enjoy the rest of ProtagonistA's day . 
ProtagonistA had just finished eating dinner with ProtagonistA's family and was walking down the aisle of the car park of the local church when the first thing ProtagonistA noticed was ProtagonistB looking back at ProtagonistA from the rear window . The second thing ProtagonistA noticed was the car idling next to ProtagonistB with the driver 's side door open . Without thinking any further , ProtagonistA ran over to the car and jumped in . ProtagonistB , surprised at first , followed suit . They sped off into the night , not knowing where they were going or what they were doing , but knowing that they had to get as far away from that church as possible . 
ProtagonistA had been thinking all day if ProtagonistA 'd ever had the chance to speak to ProtagonistB again . It had been years since they had last seen each other and ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistB would even remember ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was about to give up hope when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking down the street . ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB and they ran to each other and hugged . They both started crying and they promised to never lose touch again . 
ProtagonistA was a lot of things , but most ponies did n't know just how kind ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA was always quick to help out a friend in need and ProtagonistA was always lending a listening ear . Even though ProtagonistA was always surrounded by ponies , ProtagonistA never felt alone . ProtagonistA was always content just being ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , it felt like days . ProtagonistA was so thirsty ProtagonistA's throat felt like it was on fire , and ProtagonistA's stomach was so empty it was cramping . The sound of the moon was quiet and the only thing bothering ProtagonistA was that the air was slightly too cold for ProtagonistA liking . ProtagonistA had seen no sign of life in days , not even a plant . ProtagonistA was beginning to lose hope that ProtagonistA would ever find ProtagonistA's way back home . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance . It sounded like running water . ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace and soon came to a river . ProtagonistA collapsed on the bank and drank deeply of the cool water . After quenching ProtagonistA's thirst , ProtagonistA looked around and saw a cave on the other side of the river . ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA could see a light coming from inside . ProtagonistA decided to cross the river and see if there was anyone in the cave . ProtagonistA was so tired , ProtagonistA could barely stand . ProtagonistA waded into the water and started to swim . Halfway across , ProtagonistA felt something grab ProtagonistA's leg and pull ProtagonistA under . ProtagonistA struggled to free ProtagonistA , but whatever had ProtagonistA was too strong . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA being pulled further and further down into the darkness . Then everything went black . 
ProtagonistA had never been a particularly violent person . ProtagonistA avoided conflict and preferred to live a peaceful life . However , in ProtagonistA's younger and more vulnerable years , ProtagonistA had never held a weapon above ProtagonistA's head . That changed when ProtagonistA was attacked one night while walking home from work . ProtagonistB came out of the shadows and grabbed ProtagonistA , holding a knife to ProtagonistA's throat . ProtagonistA was terrified . ProtagonistA thought for sure ProtagonistA was going to die . But then , something inside ProtagonistA snapped . ProtagonistA lifted ProtagonistA's hand and grabbed ProtagonistB's wrist , twisting it until ProtagonistB dropped the knife . Then ProtagonistA brought the knife up and stabbed ProtagonistB in the stomach . ProtagonistB fell to the ground , clutching ProtagonistB's wound and groaning in pain . ProtagonistA stood over ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest . ProtagonistA had never felt so alive . In that moment , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was capable of so much more than ProtagonistA had ever thought possible . 
ProtagonistA sat on a cardboard box in ProtagonistA's hooves and looked up at the stars and the sky . ProtagonistA was thinking about how ProtagonistA's life had changed so much in the last few months . ProtagonistA had always been a horse , but now ProtagonistA was a human . ProtagonistA was still getting used to ProtagonistA's new life , but ProtagonistA loved it . ProtagonistA loved the feeling of the wind in ProtagonistA's hair and the sun on ProtagonistA's skin . ProtagonistA loved the way the world smelled and the way the grass felt under ProtagonistA's feet . ProtagonistA even loved the way humans tasted . ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's new life , but ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's old life sometimes . ProtagonistA missed the smell of the barn and the feel of the hay . ProtagonistA missed the sound of the horses running in the field . But ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's new life and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never go back to being a horse . 
In the eagerness of ProtagonistA's youth , ProtagonistA had known exactly what ProtagonistA was destined to become . ProtagonistA was going to be a famous writer , just like ProtagonistA's idol J.K. Rowling . ProtagonistA was going to have ProtagonistA's own office in a big city , with a view of the skyline . ProtagonistA was going to be surrounded by people who loved and respected ProtagonistA . And ProtagonistA was going to be happy . But as ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA realized that life was n't quite so simple . ProtagonistA did n't become a famous writer . In fact , ProtagonistA did n't even finish ProtagonistA's novel . ProtagonistA ended up working in a coffee shop , and ProtagonistA was happy with that . Because ProtagonistA had realized that happiness was n't about achieving your dreams . It was about being content with what you had . 
One morning , as the sun was leaking its last faint rays , ProtagonistA heard the bell ring . ProtagonistA was in the kitchen preparing the breakfast ProtagonistA 'd have for ProtagonistA's grandkids for the holidays . ProtagonistA was n't looking out of the kitchen window . When ProtagonistA heard the bell , ProtagonistA went to the window to see who it was . It was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had a package for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA signed for it and took it inside . ProtagonistA opened it and found a box of chocolates . They were ProtagonistA's favorite . ProtagonistA smiled and went back to the kitchen to finish preparing breakfast . 
ProtagonistA peered into the mirror at ProtagonistA's reflection , gem eyes shining with anticipation . ProtagonistA was finally going to meet ProtagonistA's online friends in person for the first time . ProtagonistA had been talking to them for months , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA knew them already . But ProtagonistA was nervous about meeting them in person . What if they did n't like ProtagonistA ? What if ProtagonistA did n't like them ? ProtagonistA took a deep breath and told ProtagonistA to relax . It would be fine . ProtagonistA was sure of it . 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the living room of ProtagonistA's house in the suburbs of Ponyville , the fresh air of ProtagonistA's fresh - pitch garden bringing out blue - green flowers that bloomed all afternoon and remained crisp and green all night . The phone beside ProtagonistA's rang , and ProtagonistA picked it up , ProtagonistA's heart already pounding in ProtagonistA's chest .  Hello ?  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's voice trembling .  Is this ProtagonistA ?  the voice on the other end said .  Yes ,  ProtagonistA said .  I 'm sorry to tell you this , but ProtagonistB was in a car accident . ProtagonistB did n't make it .  ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's knees buckle and ProtagonistA collapsed to the floor , the phone still clutched in ProtagonistA's hand . ProtagonistA could n't believe it . This was ProtagonistA's worst nightmare come true . 
ProtagonistA was in the middle of an assignment when all of a sudden , ProtagonistA had the appearance of a forty - year - old animal . ProtagonistA was so shocked that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA tried to continue working , but it was hard to concentrate with ProtagonistA's new appearance . ProtagonistA decided to go to the mirror to take a look at ProtagonistA . When ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's reflection , ProtagonistA gasped . ProtagonistA was a cat ! ProtagonistA did n't know how this had happened , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to find a way to change back . ProtagonistA tried to think of anything that could help ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was drawing a blank . ProtagonistA was starting to feel panicked when ProtagonistA remembered that ProtagonistA had seen a show about this once . They had said that if you imagine yourself as your true form , you will change back . So , ProtagonistA took a deep breath and imagined ProtagonistA as a human . ProtagonistA felt a tingling sensation all over ProtagonistA's body and when ProtagonistA looked in the mirror again , ProtagonistA was back to normal . ProtagonistA was so relieved that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA decided to go to bed and try to forget about the whole incident . 
ProtagonistA was riding ProtagonistB down Mount Fouladuddy when it happened . ProtagonistA was having a quite a pleasant ride when ProtagonistB suddenly stopped and would not move . ProtagonistA tried everything ProtagonistA could think of , but ProtagonistB just would n't budge . ProtagonistA was starting to get worried when ProtagonistA heard a voice behind ProtagonistA .  Hello there ,  the voice said .  It looks like ProtagonistA 're having some trouble . ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistC .  Yes ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistB wo n't move . Let ProtagonistC take a look ,  ProtagonistC said . ProtagonistC walked over and placed ProtagonistC's hand on ProtagonistB's head . After a few moments , ProtagonistB started moving again . There ProtagonistA go ,  ProtagonistC said .  Just give ProtagonistB a little encouragement and ProtagonistB 'll be fine . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistC and continued on ProtagonistA's way . ProtagonistA was amazed at what had just happened and grateful for ProtagonistC's help . 
ProtagonistA sat down on the edge of the desk , and looked around for ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA saw them sitting in a circle around the teacher 's desk , laughing and joking with each other . ProtagonistA felt a pang of jealousy . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could be like them , carefree and happy . But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't . ProtagonistA had to be strong , for ProtagonistA's family . 
ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistA 'd be better off dead . ProtagonistA had been through so much pain and suffering in ProtagonistA's life that ProtagonistA could n't take it anymore . ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's husband , ProtagonistA's children , ProtagonistA's job , and ProtagonistA's home . ProtagonistA was all alone in the world and ProtagonistA could n't see any way out . ProtagonistA was tired of fighting , tired of being alive . So , ProtagonistA made a decision . ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistA's own life . ProtagonistA would end ProtagonistA's pain once and for all . ProtagonistA wrote a note , saying goodbye to the world , and then ProtagonistA took a bottle of pills . ProtagonistA lay down in ProtagonistA's bed and waited to die . But death did n't come . The pills did n't work . ProtagonistA was still alive , and ProtagonistA's pain was still there . ProtagonistA was even more alone now , and ProtagonistA had no idea what to do . 
Once upon a time , there was a land called Twilight . It was a magical place where ProtagonistA lived and laughed ProtagonistA's butt off . One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was so handsome and charming that ProtagonistA fell in love with ProtagonistB instantly . They got married and had a beautiful baby girl . They lived happily ever after . 
ProtagonistA loved spending time outside , especially when the sun was shining . Today , ProtagonistA was enjoying the warmth of the sun on ProtagonistA's fur while ProtagonistA sat cross - legged on the ground , resting ProtagonistA's hooves on the back of ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let out a contented sigh , feeling the grass tickle ProtagonistA's belly . ProtagonistA was so relaxed that ProtagonistA did n't even hear the approach of the other animals until they were right next to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  asked a voice . ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw a rabbit , a squirrel , and a bird all looking at ProtagonistA with confusion . I'm just enjoying the sun ,  ProtagonistA replied . But why are ProtagonistA sitting like that ?  asked the squirrel . It 's comfortable ,  said ProtagonistA . But it looks so strange ,  said the bird . ProtagonistA just shrugged and went back to enjoying the sun . ProtagonistA did n't care what the other animals thought of ProtagonistA ; ProtagonistA was happy just being ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA got up before dawn and stepped away from the distractions of ProtagonistA's city . ProtagonistA walked for hours , enjoying the peace and quiet of the early morning . The sun began to rise , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA at the edge of a beautiful forest . ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , unsure if ProtagonistA should go in , but then ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name . It sounded like ProtagonistA's mother 's voice , so ProtagonistA followed it . ProtagonistA walked for what felt like hours , until ProtagonistA came to a clearing . In the center of the clearing was a beautiful tree , and sitting in the tree was ProtagonistA's mother . ProtagonistA's mother smiled and beckoned ProtagonistA closer . ProtagonistA walked to the tree and hugged ProtagonistA's mother tightly . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had finally found ProtagonistA's way home . 
ProtagonistA lay down on ProtagonistA's hooves and reached for ProtagonistA's glass of juice . ProtagonistA was exhausted from a long day of work and just wanted to relax . ProtagonistA sipped ProtagonistA's juice and closed ProtagonistA's eyes , letting the cool liquid refresh ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA sighed and let ProtagonistA's mind wander , thinking about all the things ProtagonistA had to do tomorrow . Soon , ProtagonistA was asleep , dreaming of a world where ProtagonistA did n't have to worry about anything . 
ProtagonistA was asleep and thinking about food when ProtagonistA awoke to the sound of hooves approaching from behind the deep , dark , still trees of Equestria . ProtagonistA sat up and rubbed ProtagonistA's eyes , expecting to see one of ProtagonistA's pony friends coming to wake ProtagonistA up for a morning adventure . Instead , ProtagonistA saw a large , dark horse standing in the shadows , watching ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA gasped and scrambled to ProtagonistA's feet , but the horse was gone as quickly as it had appeared . ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and tried to tell ProtagonistA it was just a dream , but ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that something was watching ProtagonistA from the darkness . 
ProtagonistA had had enough of telling ProtagonistA's mother 's story for a while now . ProtagonistA was tired of reliving the past and reliving ProtagonistA's mother 's pain . ProtagonistA wanted to move on with ProtagonistA's life and start fresh . So , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA's mother that ProtagonistA was done telling ProtagonistA's story . ProtagonistA was done reliving the past . ProtagonistA was ready to move on . 
ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistA 'd be better off dead . ProtagonistA had been through so much pain and suffering in ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA just could n't take it anymore . ProtagonistA was tired of fighting and just wanted to give up . So , ProtagonistA decided to take ProtagonistA's own life . ProtagonistA did n't want to leave ProtagonistA's loved ones behind , but ProtagonistA thought it was the best thing for them . ProtagonistA did n't want them to have to see ProtagonistA suffer anymore . So , ProtagonistA took a bunch of pills and went to sleep . ProtagonistA never woke up again . 
ProtagonistA smiled as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistA's father wash his hands in the sink , then rise to the counter and give ProtagonistB a knowing nod . It was clear that ProtagonistA's father approved of ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was glad . ProtagonistB was a kind and honest person , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could always count on ProtagonistB to tell the truth . 
It was a warm afternoon in April , the watch of the royal court being to witness the first trial of ProtagonistA . The King , Queen , and all the courtiers were in attendance , seated in the grand hall of the palace . ProtagonistA was brought in , ProtagonistA's hands bound in front of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was accused of conspiring with ProtagonistA's brother to overthrow the King and take the throne for themselves . ProtagonistA denied the charges , but the evidence against ProtagonistA was overwhelming . The court found ProtagonistA guilty and ProtagonistA was sentenced to death . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and watched from behind the large , open window of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been following ProtagonistB for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had first seen ProtagonistB at the market . ProtagonistB was the most beautiful horse ProtagonistA had ever seen , with a long , flowing mane and tail and a coat that shone in the sun . ProtagonistA was determined to buy ProtagonistB , no matter what the cost . ProtagonistA had saved up all ProtagonistA's money and was now ready to make an offer . ProtagonistA just had to wait for the right moment . The opportunity finally came one day when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB in the field behind ProtagonistA's house . ProtagonistA quickly saddled up ProtagonistA's own horse and rode over to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB seemed startled at first , but ProtagonistA quickly won ProtagonistB over with a few kind words and a treat . ProtagonistA then led ProtagonistB back to ProtagonistB's stall and made ProtagonistB an offer . ProtagonistB was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistA was adamant . ProtagonistA promised to take good care of ProtagonistB and even offered to pay more than the asking price . In the end , ProtagonistB agreed and ProtagonistA rode off with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was over the moon . ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA now owned ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA vowed to take good care of ProtagonistB and give ProtagonistB the best life possible . 
ProtagonistA stood up and stretched out ProtagonistA's forelegs . ProtagonistA was getting a little bit tired from all the walking ProtagonistA had been doing lately . It was hard to believe that it had been almost a year since ProtagonistA had first set out on ProtagonistA's journey . ProtagonistA had seen so many places and met so many interesting people . ProtagonistA was looking forward to finally reaching ProtagonistA's destination . ProtagonistA had been walking for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's home in the forest . ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way to the city , where ProtagonistA had always dreamed of living . ProtagonistA was getting closer and closer every day , and ProtagonistA could hardly wait to see it . One day , as ProtagonistA was walking along , ProtagonistA came to a fork in the road . ProtagonistA stopped for a moment , unsure of which way to go . ProtagonistA was about to take the left path , when ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name . It was a voice ProtagonistA recognized immediately . It was ProtagonistA's friend , the White Rabbit . ProtagonistA , where are ProtagonistA going ?  the Rabbit asked . I'm on ProtagonistA's way to the city ,  ProtagonistA replied . Oh , ProtagonistA must come with me ,  the Rabbit said .  I 'm just on my way there myself . I can show ProtagonistA the way . ProtagonistA was happy to have the company , and ProtagonistA followed the Rabbit down the path . Soon , they came to a huge gate . This is it ,  the Rabbit said .  Welcome to the city . ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA's eyes . The city was even more beautiful than ProtagonistA had imagined . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistA's friend , and then ProtagonistA went off to explore ProtagonistA's new home . 
ProtagonistA had seen the white sapland before , but ProtagonistA had n't known what it was , or why people did what they did . ProtagonistA had always thought it was a place for madmen and women , a place where people went to forget who they were . But now ProtagonistA knew the truth . The white sapland was a place of peace , a place where people went to find themselves . And ProtagonistA was going to find ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistB had been out fishing all day , and ProtagonistA had been eagerly awaiting ProtagonistB's return . But when the doorbell rang , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistB had just drowned . ProtagonistA was devastated . 
ProtagonistA cast the last of ProtagonistA's net on ProtagonistB's second moon , soaring high above the likeness of an alder - maiden in the deep , silent night . It was a cold night , and ProtagonistB's moon was particularly bright . ProtagonistA had been tracking ProtagonistB for weeks , and ProtagonistA knew that this was ProtagonistA's opportunity to finally catch ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a notoriously elusive creature , and ProtagonistA was determined to be the one to capture ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had set ProtagonistA's sights on ProtagonistB's moon and had been patiently waiting for ProtagonistA's chance . When ProtagonistB finally appeared , ProtagonistA was ready . ProtagonistA cast ProtagonistA's net and waited for ProtagonistB to be ensnared . But ProtagonistB was too quick . ProtagonistB dodged the net and flew off into the night , leaving ProtagonistA empty - handed . 
ProtagonistA rode into the door of the guild hall and pulled ProtagonistA's whip out of ProtagonistA's saddlebag . ProtagonistA was a bounty hunter , and ProtagonistA had just captured ProtagonistA's latest target . ProtagonistA walked into the hall and tied ProtagonistA's target to a chair . ProtagonistA then went to the bounty board and collected ProtagonistA's reward . 
The last full moon of the sultry afternoons of January and February was the last time that the air was clear and ProtagonistA shone pale and clear across the land . It is a mystery to many who understand the nature of things , that ProtagonistA shines so pale in summer , and so bright in winter , and so clear in the summer , that ProtagonistA sometimes appears to be cradling a corn - field in ProtagonistA's arms . 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the bank , searching for ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA had been playing with them near the river when ProtagonistA got separated . Now , the sun was setting and ProtagonistA was starting to get scared . ProtagonistA called out their names , but there was no answer . ProtagonistA was just about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a voice . It was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had been looking for ProtagonistA too . They were both relieved and happy to be reunited . They walked back to the river to find the others and continued playing until it was time to go home . 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the couch in the living room of a house in the middle of nowhere , drinking a glass of water which ProtagonistA hoped would last through the night . ProtagonistA had been walking for days , ever since ProtagonistA had been kicked out of ProtagonistA's home with nothing but the clothes on ProtagonistA's back . ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was going , or what ProtagonistA was going to do when ProtagonistA got there . ProtagonistA had been living off of rain water and whatever food ProtagonistA could find in the forest , but ProtagonistA's supplies were running low . ProtagonistA was weak and exhausted , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would n't be able to make it much further . ProtagonistA had been debating whether or not to just give up and lay down to die , when ProtagonistA had come across this house in the middle of nowhere . At first ProtagonistA had been scared to go inside , but ProtagonistA was so desperate that ProtagonistA had decided to take the risk . There was no one home , and it looked like it had been abandoned for years . ProtagonistA had found a glass and some water in the kitchen , and ProtagonistA had been sitting on the couch ever since , trying to decide what to do next . ProtagonistA was so tired , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would n't be able to keep ProtagonistA's eyes open much longer . ProtagonistA decided to lay down and see if ProtagonistA could get some rest , even if it was just for a little while . ProtagonistA was n't sure what was going to happen to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was too tired to care . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let ProtagonistA drift off to sleep . 
ProtagonistA had taken a rest from ProtagonistA's long and busy life , and now that ProtagonistA was free of the cares of being a wife and mother , ProtagonistA was content to enjoy the moment of happiness which ProtagonistA had prepared for just such an occasion . ProtagonistA had a cup of tea and a book , and ProtagonistA was just about to settle in when ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door . ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and there was ProtagonistB there , who looked to be about the same age as ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was very beautiful , with long blonde hair and blue eyes . ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA's daughter , and ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had come to visit ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was surprised , but ProtagonistA was also very happy to see ProtagonistB . They hugged each other and then sat down to talk . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's own life . They talked for a long time , and it was a very happy visit . 
The first time ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA , when ProtagonistA had been a boy called Spike , ProtagonistB had been struck by ProtagonistA's beauty . ProtagonistA was unlike any other girl ProtagonistB had ever seen . ProtagonistA was kind and sweet and always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistB had been instantly smitten . ProtagonistB had tried to talk to ProtagonistA on several occasions , but ProtagonistA had always seemed nervous and shy around ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had been about to give up hope when , one day , ProtagonistA had finally spoken to ProtagonistB . They had struck up a conversation and ProtagonistB had found out that ProtagonistA was interested in the same things as ProtagonistB . They had become friends quickly and ProtagonistB had started to develop deeper feelings for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB had been planning to tell ProtagonistA how ProtagonistB felt , but before ProtagonistB could , ProtagonistA had started dating someone else . ProtagonistB had been heartbroken , but had tried to hide it . ProtagonistB had continued to be friends with ProtagonistA , even though it had been difficult . ProtagonistB had been happy for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA had got married and had children , even though it had made ProtagonistB feel even more alone . Now , many years later , ProtagonistB was still single and ProtagonistA was divorced . They had both come to the same party and , for the first time in years , ProtagonistB had felt that old spark of attraction . They had spent the night talking and laughing and ProtagonistB had felt like ProtagonistB was finally home . 
ProtagonistA was called Astrid , and ProtagonistA was a little girl , and ProtagonistA had a stick and a torch , and ProtagonistA used to dream of a land where ProtagonistA might live happily ever after with ProtagonistA's loving husband and beautiful little daughter and little son . ProtagonistA would often imagine what their life would be like and what they would do together . ProtagonistA would daydream about going on adventures and exploring new places with them . ProtagonistA was always so happy in ProtagonistA's dreams and ProtagonistA knew that one day ProtagonistA would find the perfect place to live happily ever after . 
ProtagonistA stood up and brushed ProtagonistA's bangs off ProtagonistA's head . It was time to get moving . ProtagonistA had been sitting in the same spot for far too long and ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA did n't get up and start moving , ProtagonistA would never get anywhere . ProtagonistA had a goal and ProtagonistA was determined to reach it . So ProtagonistA started walking . ProtagonistA walked for hours , never stopping for a break . ProtagonistA was getting tired , but ProtagonistA pushed on . ProtagonistA was n't going to give up . Finally , ProtagonistA reached ProtagonistA's destination . ProtagonistA had made it . ProtagonistA had achieved ProtagonistA's goal . ProtagonistA was exhausted , but ProtagonistA was also triumphant . ProtagonistA had done it . 
ProtagonistA stood in the shadow of ProtagonistA's mother 's dusty glass cabinet , ProtagonistA's hooves hanging down on the peg to keep ProtagonistA right eye steady . ProtagonistA was looking at the family portrait that hung on the wall . It was taken when ProtagonistA was just a foal , and ProtagonistA's mother and father were both alive . ProtagonistA remembered the day it was taken . They had all been laughing and joking , and ProtagonistA's mother had been so happy . Now , ProtagonistA's mother was gone , and ProtagonistB was barely hanging on . The cancer had taken so much from ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA felt a tear run down ProtagonistA's cheek , and ProtagonistA quickly wiped it away . ProtagonistA did n't want ProtagonistB to see ProtagonistA crying . ProtagonistB was weak enough as it was . 
ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes and ProtagonistA was pissed . ProtagonistA had been long and rambling , and had a lot to address . Oh yeah , oh yeah , just twenty - one minutes long . Well . That means just eighteen minutes . But that does n't matter , because on top of that ProtagonistA was already coming up with a whole bunch of ways to torture me . ProtagonistA started with the usual things , like making me eat all the frosting off the cupcakes or making me sit in the middle of the room while ProtagonistA ate them all in front of me . But then ProtagonistA started getting creative . ProtagonistA would put the cupcakes in my shoes or in my bed , so that I would have to sleep with them . ProtagonistA would hide them in my clothes so that I would find them when I went to put them on . Eventually , the cupcakes started showing up in places where I would never expect to find them . Like in my cereal box , or in my toothbrush holder . Once , ProtagonistA even put one in my toilet . I was getting sick of finding cupcakes everywhere , and I told ProtagonistA so . But ProtagonistA just laughed and said that I should be grateful that ProtagonistA was even giving me the cupcakes in the first place . I was about to tell ProtagonistA off when I realized that ProtagonistA was right . I was being ridiculous . After all , ProtagonistA was my best friend and ProtagonistA would never really hurt me . Eventually , the cupcake prank war died down and we went back to eating them together like we used to . But every time I see a cupcake now , I ca n't help but think of all the creative ways ProtagonistA came up with to torture me . 
ProtagonistA watched from the front porch as ProtagonistA's parents put the finishing touches to their house . It was the house ProtagonistA had grown up in , and the house ProtagonistA would always think of as home . Even though ProtagonistA was now an adult , and lived in ProtagonistA's own home , ProtagonistA still felt a sense of comfort and safety when ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's parents ' house . ProtagonistA knew that no matter what happened in ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA's parents would always be there for ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was one of the most distinguished ladies of the abbey of St. Peter 's . ProtagonistA was admitted into the good order of the church only by consent of the vicar , but who at Alice 's death had been faithful to it ever since . ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's late baccus the eldest of the four daughters of the house . Though ProtagonistA's mother and grandmother had been very obscure in their regard to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had often thought ProtagonistA's grandfather a pretty poor particular , but in ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA had been extremely wretched , and altogether destitute of everything ProtagonistA should have been able to procure for ProtagonistA . And after ProtagonistA's grandmother 's death , being very deprived of money , and very poor indeed , ProtagonistA had nothing but ProtagonistA's imagination in ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was on the pedestal of ProtagonistB's bed , drooping down and frowning as ProtagonistA stared up at the stars . It was a clear night , and the stars were shining bright , but ProtagonistA just could n't enjoy them . ProtagonistA was too worried about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had been acting strange lately . ProtagonistB was always either moping around or getting angry for no reason . ProtagonistA had tried to talk to ProtagonistB about it , but ProtagonistB just brushed ProtagonistA off . ProtagonistA was starting to get worried that something was really wrong . ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear ProtagonistB come into the room . When ProtagonistA finally noticed ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA jumped up in surprise . ProtagonistB ! What are ProtagonistB doing ProtagonistB just stared at ProtagonistA for a moment before ProtagonistB finally spoke .  ProtagonistB could n't sleep , so ProtagonistB came to look at the stars . But now ProtagonistB see that ProtagonistA 're here too . Yeah , ProtagonistA could n't sleep either . ProtagonistA was just thinking about ProtagonistA . What about ProtagonistA was just worried about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB 've been acting really strange lately . ProtagonistB sighed and sat down on the bed .  ProtagonistB know . ProtagonistB do n't know what 's wrong with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB just feel really lost right now . Rainbow Dash sat down next to ProtagonistB and put a comforting wing around ProtagonistB .  It 's okay , ProtagonistB . We 'll figure it out together .  
ProtagonistA was staring up at ProtagonistA's book , dazed and wondering when ProtagonistA would get the chance to finish it . It was a beautiful book , with intricate illustrations and a fascinating story , but ProtagonistA's life was so busy that ProtagonistA never seemed to have any time to read it . ProtagonistA had been meaning to read it for months , but it always got pushed to the back of ProtagonistA's mind in favor of other things . But now , as ProtagonistA stared up at the book , ProtagonistA made a decision . ProtagonistA was going to finish it , no matter what . Even if it meant staying up all night , ProtagonistA was going to read until ProtagonistA reached the end . And so , with a new determination , ProtagonistA opened the book and began to read . 
ProtagonistA was twelve years old when ProtagonistA was first put in the cage . ProtagonistA was small for ProtagonistA's age , and the cage was too tight for ProtagonistA to stand up in . ProtagonistA had to crouch down , and the heavy metal bars pressed into ProtagonistA's skin . The cage was dark , and there was no way for ProtagonistA to see outside . ProtagonistA could hear the other children laughing and playing , but ProtagonistA was never able to see them . After a while , ProtagonistA stopped trying to see outside . ProtagonistA stopped trying to talk to the other children . ProtagonistA stopped trying to do anything . ProtagonistA just sat in the darkness , waiting for someone to come and let ProtagonistA out . 
Three years ago M. Baudinot , who had been Assistant - Governor of North America , had the honour of hearing that in the year 1779 a new and very considerable controversy had arisen between ProtagonistA and England ; and that ProtagonistA had a right to treat with great violence , or to abandon the laws , that were established under their former alliance , upon the rights of which ProtagonistA was , as ProtagonistA claims , the first and foremost citizen , and as ProtagonistA had been ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA was first formed , but as a subject , when they had embraced the crown of England , and had established the rights of citizens , which , however , they did not abandon , till after their union , but continued to regard as alien , and uncertain . 
ProtagonistA was standing there in the shade of the window of ProtagonistA's mother 's office , watching ProtagonistA's mother 's house burn down . ProtagonistA could see the flames leaping up into the sky , and the smoke billowing out from the windows . ProtagonistA's mother had been killed in the fire , and ProtagonistA was the only one who had survived . ProtagonistA was the only one who knew what had happened . 
ProtagonistA lay down in ProtagonistA's little garden and turned ProtagonistA's head to the west . ProtagonistA could see the sun setting behind the trees and the sky turning a beautiful orange . ProtagonistA felt so peaceful and happy lying there in the grass . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let out a deep sigh . 
It was the day ProtagonistA's sister , Applejack , died , yet ProtagonistA was feeling very much alive . ProtagonistA had always been the more outgoing of the two , and ProtagonistA's sister 's death had hit ProtagonistA hard . But , ProtagonistA was determined to live ProtagonistA's life to the fullest and make ProtagonistA's sister proud . ProtagonistA went out that day and did everything ProtagonistA's sister loved to do . ProtagonistA went for a long walk in the woods , ate ProtagonistA's favorite foods , and even went dancing . It was as if ProtagonistA's sister was right there with ProtagonistA , living life to the fullest . And ProtagonistA knew that 's what ProtagonistA's sister would want . 
ProtagonistA sat on the deck and watched over the sea of stars that stretched out before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt so small and insignificant compared to the vastness of the universe , but ProtagonistA also felt a sense of wonder and awe at the beauty of it all . ProtagonistA sat there for hours , just watching and marveling at the night sky . 
When ProtagonistA first met ProtagonistA's cruel and unhappy fate , ProtagonistA was as young as a pegasus . But , as ProtagonistA was then called , ProtagonistA was one of the bravest and most lovely princesses ever to sit upon the throne of Ages . As brave and beautiful as a bull in a stallion , ProtagonistA was the envy of all the other princesses . But ProtagonistA's beauty was not to last . A wicked witch cursed ProtagonistA , turning ProtagonistA into a hideous beast . ProtagonistA was locked away in a tower , hidden from the world . The only company ProtagonistA had was the witch , who taunted ProtagonistA and made ProtagonistA's life a living hell . But ProtagonistA was not to be defeated . ProtagonistA made a magical mirror , and through it ProtagonistA could see the world outside . ProtagonistA saw the other princesses , living their happy lives , and it made ProtagonistA even more determined to break free from ProtagonistA's prison . One day , ProtagonistA finally managed to escape . The witch was hot on ProtagonistA's heels , but ProtagonistA was faster . ProtagonistA made it to the safety of a nearby kingdom , where ProtagonistA was welcomed with open arms . The witch was never seen again , and ProtagonistA lived happily ever after . ProtagonistA eventually found true love , and ProtagonistA's story became an inspiration to all who heard it . 
ProtagonistA sat on the porch , rocking back and forth in ProtagonistA's rocking chair , looking out over the grounds of ProtagonistA's beloved family estate in the village of Valance . ProtagonistA had lived there ProtagonistA's whole life and loved it dearly . The estate had been in ProtagonistA's family for generations and ProtagonistA was the last living member . ProtagonistA was proud of ProtagonistA's heritage and loved to share stories of ProtagonistA's ancestors with anyone who would listen . ProtagonistA's mind wandered as ProtagonistA rocked back and forth , thinking of all the happy times ProtagonistA had experienced in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistA's late husband , whom ProtagonistA had loved dearly , and of their happy life together . ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistA's children and grandchildren , and how much ProtagonistA loved them all . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the other side of the estate . ProtagonistA got up from ProtagonistA's rocking chair and walked over to the edge of the porch to see what was going on . To ProtagonistA's surprise , ProtagonistA saw a group of people walking towards the house . They were all carrying bags and boxes and looked to be in a hurry . ProtagonistA wondered who they could be and what they wanted . ProtagonistA did n't recognize any of them , but they looked friendly enough . As they got closer , ProtagonistA saw that they were all wearing uniforms . They were ProtagonistA's heart skipped a beat as ProtagonistA realized what was happening . The soldiers were coming to take over the ProtagonistA quickly ran inside the house and locked the door . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could n't let them take ProtagonistA's beloved home away from ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA would have to fight for it ! 
ProtagonistA's skirt was almost completely around ProtagonistA's ankles , but ProtagonistA 'd told me that ProtagonistA would n't have mercy on ProtagonistA . I was trying my best to keep up , but ProtagonistA's pace was too fast for me . ProtagonistA was always like this , always pushing ProtagonistA to the limit . I admired ProtagonistA's determination , but I wished ProtagonistA would slow down sometimes . We were out on a run , just like we did every morning . It was our time to clear our heads and get in a good workout . But today , ProtagonistA was extra determined . ProtagonistA was running faster than usual and I was struggling to keep up . Finally , I could n't take it anymore . I had to stop and catch my breath . ProtagonistA did n't even slow down , ProtagonistA just kept going . I watched ProtagonistA disappear into the distance , ProtagonistA's skirt flapping in the wind . I was about to give up and walk back home , when I heard ProtagonistA's voice in my head .  Do n't give up on yourself , you can do it!Her words gave me strength and I started running again . I caught up to ProtagonistA and we finished our run together . I was exhausted , but I felt good . I was proud of myself for not giving up . Thanks to ProtagonistA , I had learned that I was capable of more than I thought . ProtagonistA was always pushing me to be better and today was no different . I was grateful to have ProtagonistA in my life , even if ProtagonistA did make me work hard . 
ProtagonistA burst through the door to ProtagonistB's room , screaming ,  What 's happened ?  ProtagonistB was sitting on ProtagonistB's bed , looking pale and shaken .  ProtagonistB do n't know ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB was just sitting here and suddenly everything went dark . ProtagonistB ca n't see anything .  ProtagonistA's heart sank . This was ProtagonistA's worst nightmare come true . ProtagonistB had been born blind . And now , it seemed , ProtagonistB was going deaf as well .  Can ProtagonistB hear ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistA asked , desperation in ProtagonistA's voice . But ProtagonistB just shook ProtagonistB's head .  ProtagonistB ca n't hear anything either .  ProtagonistA put ProtagonistA's head in ProtagonistA's hands and wept . This was just too much to bear . 
A little over a year ago , ProtagonistA made the decision to go back to ProtagonistA's kingdom . ProtagonistA was tired of living in the city and wanted to be back in the countryside where ProtagonistA felt most at home . ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things and said goodbye to ProtagonistA's friends , promising to keep in touch . The journey was long and hard , but eventually ProtagonistA made it back to ProtagonistA's kingdom . ProtagonistA was warmly welcomed by ProtagonistA's subjects , who had missed ProtagonistA dearly . ProtagonistA was happy to be home and settled back into ProtagonistA's old life quickly . ProtagonistA 's been back for a year now and things are better than ever . ProtagonistA 's glad ProtagonistA made the decision to come home and is looking forward to many more years in ProtagonistA's kingdom . 
ProtagonistA stood facing the sky and said ,  Okay , that 's enough of this ,  and ProtagonistA should have known better than to ask for a better answer . ProtagonistA was done with this place , this sky , this never - ending blue . It was time to move on . ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA back on the sky and started walking . ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistA's way . ProtagonistA had to . ProtagonistA had come too far to turn back now . The sky called out to ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA walked away , but ProtagonistA did n't look back . ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA would never leave . ProtagonistA kept walking until ProtagonistA came to a door . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA knew , but ProtagonistA knew that this door would lead ProtagonistA to where ProtagonistA needed to go . ProtagonistA opened the door and stepped through . 
ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's room and stepped out into the living room of ProtagonistA's hooves . ProtagonistA was a young woman , barely out of ProtagonistA's teens , and still living at home with ProtagonistA's parents . It was a typical Saturday morning , and ProtagonistA's parents were both at work . ProtagonistA had the house to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA walked to the kitchen and made ProtagonistA a cup of coffee . Then ProtagonistA sat down on the couch and turned on the TV . ProtagonistA flipped through the channels , looking for something to watch . ProtagonistA settled on a movie and watched it for a while . After a while , ProtagonistA got up and went to the bathroom . When ProtagonistA came back , ProtagonistA noticed that the coffee had made her hooves wet . ProtagonistA got up and went to the kitchen to get a towel . When ProtagonistA got back to the living room , ProtagonistA saw that the coffee had made a mess on the couch . ProtagonistA sighed and cleaned it up . Then ProtagonistA went back to watching ProtagonistA's movie . 
ProtagonistA pulled ProtagonistA's head from the ground and looked skyward , feeling the warmth of the sun on ProtagonistA's forehead . ProtagonistA had been lying in the grass for hours , just staring up at the clouds and letting ProtagonistA's mind wander . It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA did n't want to waste it inside . ProtagonistA got up and brushed the dirt off ProtagonistA's clothes , then set off down the path , not knowing where ProtagonistA was going , but trusting that ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistA's way . 
ProtagonistA had always been a very pale girl , so when ProtagonistA found the diamond ProtagonistA's skin turned an even brighter shade of white . The diamond was so beautiful that ProtagonistA could n't help but touch it , and as soon as ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA's hair was cut off . At first , ProtagonistA was scared , but then ProtagonistA realized that the diamond had only cut off ProtagonistA's hair and not ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA was relieved and happy , and ProtagonistA decided to keep the diamond as a reminder of the day when ProtagonistA almost lost ProtagonistA's head . 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the grass , watching the ponies ProtagonistA loved die . ProtagonistA had been with them since they were born , and now they were gone . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to go on without them . 
ProtagonistA's wild optimism was a facade to hide ProtagonistA's true feelings . Deep down , ProtagonistA was a hostile person who was always looking for a fight . ProtagonistA's friends knew this about ProtagonistA and they always tried to avoid ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA was in one of ProtagonistA's moods . However , ProtagonistA's optimistic personality was so infectious that they often found themselves drawn to ProtagonistA despite ProtagonistA's dark side . One day , ProtagonistA's friends were having a picnic in the park . They were laughing and joking and having a great time . ProtagonistA was in a good mood too and ProtagonistA was enjoying the company . However , the picnic was interrupted by a group of aggressive dogs . They were barking and growling and seemed ready to attack . ProtagonistA's friends were terrified , but ProtagonistA just laughed . ProtagonistA thought the whole situation was hilarious . ProtagonistA's laughter only made the dogs more angry and they started to move closer to the group . ProtagonistA's friends begged ProtagonistA to stop laughing , but ProtagonistA just could n't help ProtagonistA . In the end , the dogs attacked and everyone was forced to run for their lives . It was a horrifying experience , but ProtagonistA just saw it as another adventure . ProtagonistA's friends were shaken up by the incident , but ProtagonistA was already planning ProtagonistA's next adventure . ProtagonistA was always looking for the next thrill , no matter how dangerous it might be . 
ProtagonistA sat on the bank and stretched out ProtagonistB's hooves before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was a beautiful horse , and ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's owner . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB very much , and ProtagonistA was very grateful to have ProtagonistB . One day , while ProtagonistA was brushing ProtagonistB's coat , ProtagonistA found a grey hair . ProtagonistA was shocked , because ProtagonistA had never seen a grey hair on ProtagonistB before . ProtagonistA knew that this meant that ProtagonistB was getting old , and ProtagonistA was very sad about it . 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's garden , enjoying the last of the twilight . ProtagonistA had half - eaten an apple and was idly tossing the core into the bushes when ProtagonistA saw a movement out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye . ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB sitting on ProtagonistB's haunches , looking at ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's bright eyes . ProtagonistA was startled , but not afraid . ProtagonistA held out ProtagonistA's hand and ProtagonistB came closer , sniffing at ProtagonistA's fingers . Then , to ProtagonistA's amazement , ProtagonistB spoke . Good evening , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB 'm Twilight . ProtagonistB 'm sorry to intrude , but ProtagonistB could n't help but notice ProtagonistA's apple . May ProtagonistB have a bite?Alice was so surprised that ProtagonistA did n't know what to say . ProtagonistA simply nodded and held out the apple . ProtagonistB took a bite , then sat on ProtagonistB's haunches and began to eat . As ProtagonistB ate , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life in the forest . ProtagonistB told of the other animals ProtagonistB lived with and the adventures ProtagonistB had had . ProtagonistA was entranced . ProtagonistA had never met a talking rabbit before , and ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA never would again . When ProtagonistB had finished the apple , ProtagonistB bid ProtagonistA goodnight and hopped away into the darkness . ProtagonistA sat for a long time , thinking about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB . 
The first time I saw ProtagonistA drape the tray table of ProtagonistA's crib across the kitchen window , it was ProtagonistB , looking through the window and murmuring ,  Oh , there 's ProtagonistC .  I was so startled that I dropped my book . ProtagonistB turned to me with a smile .  Did n't mean to scare you ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB just wanted to get a better look . I peered out the window with ProtagonistB . Sure enough , there was ProtagonistC standing in the alley below , looking up at us . ProtagonistC was dirty and ragged , but there was something about ProtagonistC's eyes that made me feel sorry for ProtagonistC . Do ProtagonistB think ProtagonistC 's lost ?  I asked . ProtagonistB shrugged .  Maybe . But ProtagonistC looks like ProtagonistC could use a friend . Before I could stop ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB had climbed out the window and was down in the alley with ProtagonistC . I watched from above as they talked and laughed together . It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship . 
ProtagonistA fell for the first time in ProtagonistA's life when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was instantly attracted to ProtagonistB and they began dating . ProtagonistA soon realized that ProtagonistB was never going to do anything for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB and was willing to do anything for ProtagonistB . Eventually , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was only in love with the idea of ProtagonistB and not the reality of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA broke up with ProtagonistB and never looked back . 
ProtagonistA's heart hammered as ProtagonistA's big blue eyes darting around the room . ProtagonistA's face was determined as ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's sights on the prize . The prize was a big , shiny trophy that represented everything ProtagonistA had worked for . ProtagonistA had been training for this moment for years and ProtagonistA was not going to let anything stop ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was the best in the world and ProtagonistA was going to prove it . 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who loved to explore . ProtagonistA would often go on adventures in ProtagonistA's backyard , or in the nearby woods . One day , ProtagonistA decided to go on a horseback ride . ProtagonistA had never ridden a horse before , but ProtagonistA was determined to learn . With the help of ProtagonistA's parents , ProtagonistA was able to saddle up and ride off into the sunset . ProtagonistA bounced between shades of grey , Weiss Sun and Moon , and the occasional pink - and - white sea of sky that ProtagonistA had thrown up in ProtagonistA's wake . ProtagonistA sat atop ProtagonistA's saddle and eyed the horizon from a vantage point of a single golden star . It was a beautiful sight , and ProtagonistA was filled with a sense of wonder . ProtagonistA rode for hours , until ProtagonistA finally came to a stop at a small pond . ProtagonistA dismounted ProtagonistA's horse and walked to the edge of the pond . ProtagonistA sat down and watched the stars reflect off the surface of the water . It was a magical night , and ProtagonistA will never forget it . 
 ProtagonistA too , ProtagonistB ,  gushed ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's eyes sparkling as ProtagonistA turned the thick chain of grass around ProtagonistA to the side .  ProtagonistA 'm so glad we get to be best friends!The two ponies had been inseparable since they were foals , and now they were finally old enough to go on adventures together . They had already explored the meadow and the forest , and now they were venturing into the dangerous Dark Woods . Be careful , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB .  The Dark Woods are full of dangerous creatures . I will ,  promised ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA 'll be careful . But even as ProtagonistA said it , ProtagonistA felt something snake around ProtagonistA's leg , tripping ProtagonistA up . ProtagonistA yelped in surprise as ProtagonistA fell , and ProtagonistB came galloping over . ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA okay ?  ProtagonistB asked , worried . ProtagonistA sat up , and the first thing ProtagonistA saw was the huge , gaping mouth of a snake , ready to strike . 
ProtagonistA was a princess who lived in a time when the royal family was nominally hereditary . This meant that ProtagonistA had the right to vote and to be elected , even though ProtagonistA was just a princess . However , in those days , it was not uncommon for ProtagonistA to have electoral rights , even though there was never any reason to suppose that ProtagonistA was anything more than a princess . This meant that the majority of the population had a vote in the matter of electing their king , or rather ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA sat up , leaned forward to see the sky and ProtagonistA's Pony Ghost hovering just out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye . ProtagonistA remembered the stories ProtagonistA's grandmother used to tell ProtagonistA about the Pony Ghost and how it would come to take children away if they were n't good . ProtagonistA had always been a good girl , but ProtagonistA had never seen the Pony Ghost before . Maybe it was because ProtagonistA was getting older now . ProtagonistA did n't know , but ProtagonistA was sure that the Pony Ghost was real and it was watching ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had been feeling off all day . ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that something bad was going to happen . So when ProtagonistA was walking to the Reynolds house to fetch a glass of water in the middle of the night and ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the parlor , ProtagonistA knew something was wrong . ProtagonistA walked into the room and saw ProtagonistB standing over the body of ProtagonistB's wife with a bloody knife in ProtagonistB's hand . ProtagonistA gasped and ProtagonistB turned around , seeing ProtagonistA in the doorway . ProtagonistB ran towards ProtagonistA , knife raised , and ProtagonistA turned and ran the other way . ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB's footsteps pounding after ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was faster . ProtagonistA made it to the front door and ran out into the night . ProtagonistB chased ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was able to lose ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA ran all the way home and told ProtagonistA's parents what had happened . The police were called and ProtagonistB was arrested for the murder of ProtagonistB's wife . 
ProtagonistA sat down on the grass , ProtagonistA's hooves lightly tapping the dirt . ProtagonistA looked around at the beautiful day and sighed . ProtagonistA was so happy to be out in the fresh air and sunshine . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let the warm sun wash over ProtagonistA . 
When ProtagonistA was twelve , in the early summer of that year , ProtagonistA had this dream . ProtagonistA dreamed that ProtagonistA was walking through a beautiful garden . The flowers were so bright and the sun was so warm . ProtagonistA walked for a while , and then ProtagonistA came to a door . The door was open , and ProtagonistA walked through it . On the other side , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a dark forest . The trees were so tall and the shadows were so deep . ProtagonistA was scared , and ProtagonistA ran back to the door . But when ProtagonistA got there , the door was gone . ProtagonistA was trapped in the forest . ProtagonistA started to cry , and then ProtagonistA woke up . 
ProtagonistA was always sitting on ProtagonistB's lap , looking up at the sky . ProtagonistA was never quite sure how old ProtagonistA was , but ProtagonistA always felt younger when ProtagonistA was with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB always hushed ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA spoke , and ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream when ProtagonistA was with ProtagonistB . One day , ProtagonistB passed away . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's anchor in the world . But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would want ProtagonistA to keep looking up at the sky . So that 's what ProtagonistA did . Every day , ProtagonistA would sit on ProtagonistB's lap , even though ProtagonistB was no longer there . And ProtagonistA would look up at the sky , and ProtagonistA would feel ProtagonistB's presence with ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA stroked ProtagonistA's lower lip and watched , ProtagonistA's eyes darting across the sky , ProtagonistA's eyes trained on the alicorn . ProtagonistA had never seen anything so beautiful in all ProtagonistA's life . The alicorn was so graceful , flying through the air with ease . ProtagonistA felt a sudden urge to touch the alicorn , to feel its silky fur . ProtagonistA reached out ProtagonistA's hand , but the alicorn was gone , vanishing into the clouds . ProtagonistA sighed and lowered ProtagonistA's hand , a small smile on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget the alicorn , and the feeling of wonder it had inspired in ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had always loved flying . As a child , ProtagonistA would run through fields and pretend ProtagonistA was a bird . ProtagonistA would spread ProtagonistA's arms wide and flap ProtagonistA's little hands as fast as ProtagonistA could , imagining the wind rushing through ProtagonistA's feathers . Even now , as an adult , ProtagonistA still loved the feeling of soaring through the air . One day , ProtagonistA decided to take a break from ProtagonistA's busy life and go for a fly . ProtagonistA found a quiet spot in a field , sat down on the ground , and closed ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA let ProtagonistA's wings flap free , feeling the warm sun on ProtagonistA's face and the fresh air in ProtagonistA's lungs . It was heavenly . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the grass . ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes to see a snake slithering towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA froze in fear , but the snake was already upon ProtagonistA . It wrapped itself around ProtagonistA's body , squeezing tightly . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to act fast . ProtagonistA flapped ProtagonistA's wings with all ProtagonistA's might and took off into the air , the snake still clinging to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA flew higher and higher , until the snake finally let go . ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief and flew back to ProtagonistA's life , feeling grateful for ProtagonistA's wings . 
Some time before the disaster that afflicted the city of Traver , under the watchful eye of the wizard of ProtagonistD , a young maiden named Padma Praline of the house of Pommaries , stood before the Great CENTIME , and told the tale of ProtagonistA , by the spirited chaperone of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a young woman of great beauty , intelligence , and strength of character . ProtagonistA was also a woman of great faith , and it was this faith that sustained ProtagonistA through the many trials and tribulations ProtagonistA faced in ProtagonistA's short life . ProtagonistA was born into a noble family , but ProtagonistA's parents died when ProtagonistA was still a child . ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB was also a very strict man . ProtagonistB did not approve of ProtagonistA's desire to learn about the world and to help others . When ProtagonistA was sixteen , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was a kind and gentle man , and ProtagonistC quickly fell in love with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB did not approve of the relationship , and ProtagonistB forbid them to see each other . ProtagonistA was heartbroken , but ProtagonistA did not give up on ProtagonistA's love for ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA continued to write to ProtagonistC , and they continued to meet in secret . Then , one day , ProtagonistB caught them together . ProtagonistB was so angry that ProtagonistB disowned ProtagonistA and threw ProtagonistA out of the house . ProtagonistA was alone in the world , but ProtagonistA did not despair . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistA was determined to find a way to be with ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA went to the city of Traver , where ProtagonistA found a job as a maid in a wealthy household . ProtagonistA worked hard and saved ProtagonistA's money , and finally ProtagonistA had enough to buy a ticket to ProtagonistD . When ProtagonistA arrived in ProtagonistD , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was surprised to see ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistC was happy to have ProtagonistA there with ProtagonistC . They were married soon after , and they lived happily together for the rest of their days . ProtagonistE finished ProtagonistE's story , and the Great CENTIME was silent for a moment . Then it spoke . ProtagonistA was a woman of great courage and strength . ProtagonistA faced many challenges in ProtagonistA's life , but ProtagonistA never gave up on ProtagonistA's love for ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA is an inspiration to us all .  
ProtagonistA woke up on the morning of the day Twilight never gives a flying fuck about what kingdom ProtagonistA's ancestors ruled . ProtagonistA yawned and stretched and got out of bed . ProtagonistA went to the bathroom and brushed ProtagonistA's teeth and then went downstairs . ProtagonistA ate breakfast and then went outside . ProtagonistA saw a rabbit and followed it . ProtagonistA ended up at a big house . ProtagonistA went inside and met Twilight . They talked and then ProtagonistA left . ProtagonistA went home and went to bed . The next day , ProtagonistA woke up and it was the day Twilight never gives a flying fuck about what kingdom ProtagonistA's ancestors ruled . 
Rose looked out over the plain , but on the sound of a distant voice ProtagonistA knew exactly where ProtagonistA was . It was the sound of ProtagonistB's voice , calling ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistA turned and ran towards the sound , and as ProtagonistA got closer ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB's figure on the horizon . ProtagonistB was running towards ProtagonistB , and as they met they embraced each other tightly . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was finally home . 
ProtagonistA was in a state of great agitation when ProtagonistA discovered the Hare of the Woods . ProtagonistA related the story to the reader in a trite and somewhat agitated manner , making it clear that ProtagonistA was very upset by the discovery . The Hare of the Woods was a creature that ProtagonistA had never seen before and it terrified ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA described it as being a large , white , furry creature with long ears and red eyes . It was unlike any animal ProtagonistA had ever seen before and ProtagonistA was sure that it was going to kill ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was standing on the street with ProtagonistA's back to the house , looking up at the huge dark building which , between ProtagonistA's legs , was partially illuminated by the darkness of the night . ProtagonistA was wondering what it would be like to live in a place like that , when ProtagonistA heard a voice behind ProtagonistA . Hey , what are ProtagonistA ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistB standing there , looking at ProtagonistA with a mix of confusion and concern . I'm just looking at the building ,  ProtagonistA said . It 's kind of late to be doing that , do n't ProtagonistA think ?  ProtagonistB said . ProtagonistA shrugged .  ProtagonistA guess so . ProtagonistA was just curious about it , that 's all . Well , ProtagonistA should n't be standing out here by ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  It 's not safe . ProtagonistA nodded .  ProtagonistB 're right , ProtagonistA should go . ProtagonistA turned to walk away , but ProtagonistB stopped ProtagonistA . Wait ,  ProtagonistB said .  Let ProtagonistB walk ProtagonistA home . ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA nodded .  Thank ProtagonistB . The man walked with ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's house , and made sure ProtagonistA got inside safely . As ProtagonistA closed the door , ProtagonistA could n't help but wonder if ProtagonistA would ever see that building again . 
Even at thirteen years of age , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was destined to one day become the dominant personality in ProtagonistA's line of work . It was just a matter of time and opportunity . When ProtagonistA was sixteen , ProtagonistA got ProtagonistA's first job in a law office . ProtagonistA was a quick learner and soon became the go - to person for research and writing briefs . By the time ProtagonistA was twenty - one , ProtagonistA was running the show . ProtagonistA's boss was getting older and was happy to hand over the reins to someone younger and more energetic . ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's element . ProtagonistA loved the challenge of the work and the satisfaction of winning cases . ProtagonistA was on top of the world . 
ProtagonistA was taking a leisurely stroll through the woods when ProtagonistA suddenly fell into a deep hole . When ProtagonistA looked up , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's fellow ponies staring down at ProtagonistA in disbelief . ProtagonistA tried to climb out but the hole was too deep . ProtagonistA resigned ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's fate and lay down at the bottom of the hole . Hours passed and ProtagonistA began to grow thirsty . ProtagonistA started to hallucinate and see things that were n't really there . ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's friends and family members come to visit ProtagonistA , but they all turned their backs on ProtagonistA and left ProtagonistA alone . Eventually , ProtagonistA died of thirst and was found by ProtagonistA's fellow ponies the next day . They were all saddened by ProtagonistA's death , but no one could explain how ProtagonistA ended up in the hole . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and watched as the grand finale was played out on stage and then on TV . It was the final performance of the season and everyone was in high spirits . The energy was palpable as the contestants put on their final show . As the winner was announced , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a sense of relief . It was all over and ProtagonistA could finally relax . 
ProtagonistA felt so tired ProtagonistA could n't even tell the day . All ProtagonistA knew was that it was dark , and ProtagonistA was cold . ProtagonistA had been walking for what felt like hours , but ProtagonistA was n't sure . ProtagonistA was lost . ProtagonistA had been exploring the forest with ProtagonistA's friends when they got separated . ProtagonistA had been walking for what felt like hours , but ProtagonistA was n't sure . ProtagonistA was lost . ProtagonistA was getting scared . Suddenly , ProtagonistA saw a light in the distance . ProtagonistA walked towards it , and ProtagonistA saw a house . ProtagonistA knocked on the door , and ProtagonistB answered . ProtagonistB was surprised to see ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB invited ProtagonistA in . ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA some food and a bed for the night . ProtagonistA was so tired , ProtagonistA fell asleep as soon as ProtagonistA hit the pillow . ProtagonistA was safe now , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistA's way home in the morning . 
ProtagonistA , had ProtagonistB ; and , though ProtagonistA was only fifty - one , ProtagonistA was already growing very old indeed . ProtagonistA's hair was thin and white , and ProtagonistA's face was covered in wrinkles . ProtagonistA walked with a stoop , and ProtagonistA's hands trembled when ProtagonistA spoke . ProtagonistB was the only person who really talked to ProtagonistA . Everyone else in the village just ignored ProtagonistA , or spoke to ProtagonistA in a patronising way . But ProtagonistB treated ProtagonistA with respect , and they would often spend hours chatting together . One day , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was going to die soon . ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA could feel it in ProtagonistA's bones . ProtagonistB was sad to hear this , but ProtagonistB did n't try to dissuade ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA died a few weeks later , on ProtagonistA's birthday . ProtagonistB was the only one who came to ProtagonistA's funeral . As ProtagonistB stood there alone , ProtagonistB felt a great sense of loss . ProtagonistA had been ProtagonistB's only friend , and now ProtagonistA was gone . 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day . First , ProtagonistA overslept and was late for work . Then , ProtagonistA's boss chewed ProtagonistA out for being late . To top it all off , ProtagonistA got stuck in traffic on the way home . ProtagonistA was so frustrated by the time ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA took it out on ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's room , trying to take a nap , when ProtagonistA heard a loud banging on ProtagonistA's door . ProtagonistA groaned , got up , and answered it . To ProtagonistA's surprise , it was ProtagonistB .  Oh , ah , no ou'er here - not here at all - ah , no need to pester ProtagonistA . No ! No !  ProtagonistB shrieked , and a rain of feathers slammed into ProtagonistA's head . 
ProtagonistA was what ProtagonistA was -- a kind and caring person who always tried to help others . ProtagonistA was always there for ProtagonistA's friends and family , and ProtagonistA was always ready to lend a helping hand . Even though ProtagonistA was always helping others , ProtagonistA never asked for anything in return . ProtagonistA was content with just being able to help those ProtagonistA cared about . 
A / N : This was supposed to be a story about ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA , once ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's soul back , decided that ProtagonistA did not want to be a princess any longer , and so ProtagonistA is now known as The Princess of the Desert . ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a princess . ProtagonistA loved the idea of being able to wear pretty dresses and have ProtagonistA's own castle . But when ProtagonistA finally got ProtagonistA's soul back , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA did n't want to be a princess anymore . ProtagonistA wanted to be free . So ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's castle and went out into the desert . ProtagonistA built ProtagonistA a new home out of sand and stone , and ProtagonistA started to live a new life . ProtagonistA became known as the Princess of the Desert , and ProtagonistA was happy . ProtagonistA did n't need a prince or a castle or anything else . ProtagonistA was content in ProtagonistA's new life , and that was all that mattered . 
ProtagonistA looked around at the other ponies on the grounds and , after a few moments ' thought , decided that ProtagonistA preferred the company of the solid , rather than anything that flopped like the usual soft little things that other ponies had . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider , preferring the company of horses to ponies , and ProtagonistA felt more comfortable around the solid ponies . They did n't judge ProtagonistA and they did n't try to change ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was happy just the way ProtagonistA was . 
ProtagonistB was a very weird little pony , very little -- but through no fault of ProtagonistA's own did ProtagonistA ever know it . It was only when ProtagonistA overheard some of the other ponies talking that ProtagonistA realized just how different ProtagonistB was . Apparently , ponies were n't supposed to be able to change their appearance at will , but ProtagonistB could . ProtagonistB could make ProtagonistB's mane and tail any color ProtagonistB wanted , and ProtagonistB could make ProtagonistB's eyes any size or shape . The other ponies did n't know what to make of ProtagonistB , and neither did ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA tried to ask ProtagonistB about it , but ProtagonistB just shrugged and said ProtagonistB did n't know what they were talking about . As far as ProtagonistB was concerned , ProtagonistB was just like any other pony . But ProtagonistA knew better . ProtagonistA could see the difference , even if ProtagonistB could n't . And ProtagonistA knew that it was something special . 
ProtagonistA was about to rise , and as the last of the sun set , ProtagonistA could be seen over the sea of clouds , ProtagonistA's golden beams dancing in the wind . ProtagonistA was a beautiful sight , and everyone who saw ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a sense of wonder . 
ProtagonistA had been having strange dreams lately . Dreams where ProtagonistA was falling , or being chased . ProtagonistA tried to tell ProtagonistA it was nothing , just ProtagonistA's mind playing tricks on ProtagonistA . But when ProtagonistA woke up on Saturday morning , ProtagonistA knew something was wrong . ProtagonistA could feel it in ProtagonistA's gut . ProtagonistA tried to go about ProtagonistA's day as normal , but ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that something was off . ProtagonistA could n't focus on anything and ProtagonistA's mind kept wandering . By lunchtime , ProtagonistA was certain something was wrong . ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's room and laid down , trying to clear ProtagonistA's head . But as soon as ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes , ProtagonistA was back in the dream . ProtagonistA was falling , faster and faster . ProtagonistA tried to scream , but no sound came out . Just as ProtagonistA was about to hit the ground , ProtagonistA woke up . ProtagonistA's heart was pounding in ProtagonistA's chest and ProtagonistA was sweating . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to tell someone about the dream , but ProtagonistA was scared . What if they did n't believe ProtagonistA ? What if they thought ProtagonistA was crazy?In the end , ProtagonistA decided to tell ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could trust ProtagonistB . And ProtagonistA was right . ProtagonistB believed ProtagonistA and promised to help ProtagonistA's figure out what was going on . together , they did some research and discovered that ProtagonistA was experiencing sleep paralysis . It was a scary experience , but at least ProtagonistA knew what was happening . With the help of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was able to overcome ProtagonistA's fear and get back to sleeping soundly . 
ProtagonistA rolled over in a heap of snow that fell around ProtagonistA like a sea of gold in the middle of the night . ProtagonistA was cold and ProtagonistA's body ached , but ProtagonistA had to keep moving . ProtagonistA had been walking for days , ever since ProtagonistA had escaped from the castle . ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving . The snow was beautiful , but it was also deadly . ProtagonistA had already seen two people die in the cold , their bodies frozen in the snow . ProtagonistA did n't want to die , not like that . ProtagonistA kept moving , ProtagonistA's feet dragging through the snow . ProtagonistA wanted to find a way out of this cold place , but ProtagonistA did n't know where to go . 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day . First , ProtagonistA got scolded by ProtagonistA's boss for being late to work . Then , ProtagonistA spilled coffee all over ProtagonistA's shirt . To top it all off , ProtagonistA's boyfriend had just broken up with ProtagonistA . As ProtagonistA walked home , ProtagonistA tried to keep ProtagonistA's head up and ProtagonistA's spirits high . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could get through this tough day . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistA's best friend , waving and smiling at ProtagonistA from across the street . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's own thin smile sweep across ProtagonistA's gorgeous features . Even on ProtagonistA's worst day , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could always count on ProtagonistA's best friend . 
ProtagonistA was getting ready for ProtagonistA's date with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA wanted to look perfect . ProtagonistA had on a yellow cardigan with a striped T - shirt underneath , a length of dress - length red - blouse and a blouse with a slit at the knee that fell just below the hips , on which ProtagonistA had a pair of high heels . ProtagonistA looked in the mirror and was happy with ProtagonistA's outfit . ProtagonistA was about to leave when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had forgotten ProtagonistA's purse . ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistA's room and got ProtagonistA's purse , then ProtagonistA left . When ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistB's house , ProtagonistA was surprised to see that ProtagonistB was dressed similarly to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB had on a blue cardigan with a white T - shirt underneath , a pair of jeans with a hole in the knee and a pair of high heels . They both laughed and commented on how they looked like they were going to a costume party . After they had a few drinks and some dinner , they decided to go dancing . They went to a club and danced the night away . They had so much fun that they forgot to go home . They ended up spending the night at ProtagonistB's house . In the morning , they woke up and got dressed . They both agreed that it was one of the best nights they had ever had . 
ProtagonistA was at ProtagonistA's greatest splendour when ProtagonistA was crowned Queen of Wonderland . ProtagonistA was the most beautiful thing in the world , and everyone loved ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was kind and loving , and always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA's kingdom was a happy place , and everyone was happy to be there . 
ProtagonistA looked up at the sky as if ProtagonistA had n't seen it in a pretty while . The sun was setting and the sky was a beautiful orange . The clouds were fluffy and white . ProtagonistA sighed and smiled . It was good to see the sky again . 
ProtagonistA sat down on the edge of a brazier and looked out over the great plain of Pamlicone . ProtagonistA could see the huge forest that stretched before ProtagonistA , and the many small villages that were scattered about it . It was a beautiful sight , and ProtagonistA felt very lucky to be able to see it . 
ProtagonistA barked and hung ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA had been caught stealing a bone from the butcher 's shop . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was in for it now . The butcher would surely tell ProtagonistA's owner and ProtagonistA would be in for a scolding . ProtagonistA hung ProtagonistA's head in shame and waited for ProtagonistA's fate . 
ProtagonistB was a detective , working in the North of England , and ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA 'd never seen anything like it . ProtagonistA was only six years old , but ProtagonistA knew that something was wrong . ProtagonistB had been working on a case for weeks , and ProtagonistB was getting nowhere . ProtagonistB was getting frustrated , and ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was worried . One night , ProtagonistB came home late , and ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB 'd been drinking . ProtagonistB sat down at the kitchen table , and ProtagonistA could see the pain in ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was working on a case that was just too difficult . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB was afraid that ProtagonistB was never going to solve it . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB was the best detective in the world , and that ProtagonistB would solve the case . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA believed in ProtagonistB , and that ProtagonistB could do it . ProtagonistB hugged ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could see the tears in ProtagonistB's eyes . The next day , ProtagonistB went back to work , and ProtagonistB was determined to solve the case . A few days later , ProtagonistB came home , and ProtagonistB was triumphant . ProtagonistB had solved the case , and ProtagonistB was a hero . ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was right - ProtagonistB was the best detective in the world . 
ProtagonistA was having a tough day at work . ProtagonistA was buried in a pile of paperwork and ProtagonistA's eyes were starting to hurt from staring at the computer screen . ProtagonistA decided to take a break and went to the window to get some fresh air . As ProtagonistA looked out , ProtagonistA saw a beautiful stallion in the distance . ProtagonistA watched as it gracefully ran through the field and felt ProtagonistA's stress start to melt away . It was a nice reminder that there was a world outside of ProtagonistA's office and that ProtagonistA should take some time to enjoy it . 
ProtagonistA had a hobby , one that ProtagonistA thought was amusing . ProtagonistA would spend hours upon hours planning and executing pranks on ProtagonistA's unsuspecting friends and family . ProtagonistA's latest victim was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had planned to put a whoopee cushion on ProtagonistB's chair when ProtagonistB sat down to watch TV , but ProtagonistB caught ProtagonistA in the act and foiled ProtagonistA's plan . 
 So , what 's the plan on the diamond market ?  ProtagonistA asked as ProtagonistA gazed out at the street .  ProtagonistB 'm not sure ,  ProtagonistB replied .  ProtagonistB was thinking maybe we could wait for a while and see what happens .  ProtagonistA nodded . ProtagonistA was always the patient one . ProtagonistB was the one who was always eager to take risks .  ProtagonistA think that 's a good idea ,  ProtagonistA said .  We do n't want to make any rash decisions .  They both knew that the diamond market was volatile . It was always changing and it was hard to predict what would happen next . They had to be careful .  ProtagonistA think we should wait a few days and see what happens ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA do n't want to make any decisions until we have more information .  ProtagonistB agreed . They both knew that they had to be patient . The diamond market was never easy to predict . 
ProtagonistA had been thinking about the other day , when ProtagonistA 'd finally realized that ProtagonistA was not what ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA 'd always thought ProtagonistA was a normal girl , but it turns out ProtagonistA was anything but .

ProtagonistA was excited to use ProtagonistA's new powers to help others , and ProtagonistA was determined to make the world a better place . 
ProtagonistA had been feeling cooped up lately . ProtagonistA was tired of being inside all the time and wanted to feel the sun on ProtagonistA's skin . ProtagonistA had an idea . ProtagonistA would climb to the roof of ProtagonistA's house and jump off , then swim to the small stream that ran through the clearing on the other side of the bank . It would be the perfect adventure . ProtagonistA climbed to the roof and took a deep breath . ProtagonistA could do this . ProtagonistA was scared but ProtagonistA could do it . ProtagonistA jumped . The cold water was a shock but it felt good . ProtagonistA swam to the other side and pulled ProtagonistA out of the water .

ProtagonistB always looked forward to ProtagonistB's visits , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB would always cherish ProtagonistB's memories of the Apple family . 
ProtagonistA's mother had been trying to talk ProtagonistA into taking a trip to ProtagonistB for years , but ProtagonistA had always resisted . ProtagonistA was content living in their small town , and ProtagonistA did n't see the need to travel . But when ProtagonistA's mother became ill , ProtagonistA knew it was time to take the trip . ProtagonistA wanted to see ProtagonistA's mother happy one last time . So ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and set off for ProtagonistB . The journey was long and hard , but it was worth it when ProtagonistA saw the look of joy on ProtagonistA's mother 's face . They spent their days exploring ProtagonistB and meeting new ponies , and ProtagonistA was finally able to see what ProtagonistA's mother had been trying to tell ProtagonistA all along . There was something special about ProtagonistB that could n't be found anywhere else .

ProtagonistA was a young filly who loved to run and play . One day , while ProtagonistA was out playing with ProtagonistA's friends , ProtagonistA ran a little too hard and fell , hitting ProtagonistA's head on a rock . ProtagonistA's friends ran to get help , and ProtagonistB , came to ProtagonistA's aid . ProtagonistB held ProtagonistA's hoof flat against the back of ProtagonistA's head and used ProtagonistB's magic to lift ProtagonistA into the air and carry ProtagonistA back to ProtagonistA's home . The rest of ProtagonistA's body relaxed into the hovering motion of the completed form , and ProtagonistA was soon safe at home . 
ProtagonistA was in a daze as ProtagonistA wandered through the strange land . ProtagonistA had only the vague recollection of having visited this place once before , but ProtagonistA could n't remember when or why . The landscape was eerily familiar , yet completely unfamiliar at the same time . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was walking in a dream . Suddenly , ProtagonistA came upon a small cottage . It looked oddly familiar , but ProtagonistA could n't place why . ProtagonistA hesitantly approached the door and knocked . There was no answer . ProtagonistA tried the handle , but it was locked . ProtagonistA was about to give up and walk away when ProtagonistA heard a voice from inside the cottage .  ProtagonistA , is that ProtagonistA ?  The voice sounded old and frail . ProtagonistA's heart skipped a beat . ProtagonistA knew that voice . It was the voice of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB in years , not since the day ProtagonistB died . ProtagonistA felt a cold chill run down ProtagonistA's spine . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was n't supposed to be here . This was a place for the dead . ProtagonistA had to leave before it was too late . But before ProtagonistA could turn to run , the door of the cottage opened and ProtagonistB appeared . ProtagonistB looked exactly as ProtagonistA remembered ProtagonistB , except ProtagonistB was transparent . You're dead ,  ProtagonistA whispered . Yes , ProtagonistB am ,  ProtagonistB said .  But ProtagonistA 're here too . ProtagonistB 've been waiting for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't know what to say . ProtagonistA was scared and confused . It 's time to go , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA do n't belong here anymore . ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA nodded . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was right . ProtagonistA did n't belong in this place . ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA's hand and led ProtagonistA out of the cottage . As they walked away , ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's memories of this place fading . Soon , it was as if ProtagonistA had never been there at all . 
ProtagonistA was in the sky and looked like a jewel when ProtagonistA rose , but I never did see ProtagonistA bigger than a ball , and it was n't until I was seventeen that I realized I was bigger than ProtagonistA . I was looking at the stars one night , trying to find ProtagonistA again , when I realized that I had outgrown ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was still beautiful , but ProtagonistA was no longer my whole world . I had other things to worry about now , like school and my future . But every now and then , I still like to look up at the sky and find ProtagonistA shining bright among the stars . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked at a blank horizon . ProtagonistA felt a sense of dread in ProtagonistA's stomach as ProtagonistA thought about the long journey ahead of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had been walking for days , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA would never find ProtagonistA's way home . ProtagonistA was tired , hungry , and thirsty , but ProtagonistA kept walking . ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA stopped , ProtagonistA would never start again . ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistA's way home . 
ProtagonistB had been playing with ProtagonistA near the edge of a ruined stream when ProtagonistA suddenly lost ProtagonistA's footing . ProtagonistB quickly grabbed onto ProtagonistA to keep ProtagonistA from falling in , but in the process , ProtagonistB lost ProtagonistB's own footing and they both ended up tumbling into the stream . Luckily , the water was n't too deep and they were both able to stand up . However , their clothes were soaked and they were both shivering from the cold . They made their way back to shore and ProtagonistB promised to be more careful in the future . 
ProtagonistA's name was Marilyn , but I do not know ProtagonistA or care for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was just another person in the world to me . That is , until ProtagonistA saved my life . I was walking home one night when I was attacked by a group of thugs . I thought for sure I was going to die , but then ProtagonistA appeared out of nowhere and fought them off . ProtagonistA was like a superhero . After that , I could n't help but be interested in ProtagonistA . We became friends , and I learned that ProtagonistA was a kind and caring person . I will never forget how ProtagonistA saved my life , and I will always be grateful to ProtagonistA for it . 
ProtagonistA thundered down the hall of the Palace , ProtagonistA's hooves pounding against the stone walls . It was ProtagonistA's first time visiting the Palace and ProtagonistA was determined to make a good impression . ProtagonistA had heard that ProtagonistB was a fair and just ruler , and ProtagonistA wanted to show ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was a worthy successor . When ProtagonistA reached the throne room , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on ProtagonistB's throne , surrounded by ProtagonistB's courtiers . ProtagonistA bowed low and said ,  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA am Alice , daughter of the Duke of Wonderland . ProtagonistA have come to offer ProtagonistA's services to ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB smiled and said ,  Welcome , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB am sure ProtagonistA will be a great asset to ProtagonistB's court .  
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches , staring up at the stars . ProtagonistA was lost in thought , wondering if anyone out there was looking back at ProtagonistA . It was a peaceful night , and the stars were so bright . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could reach out and touch them . ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching ProtagonistA . Suddenly , ProtagonistA was snapped out of ProtagonistA's reverie by a voice .  Hey there .  ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB standing there . ProtagonistB was looking at ProtagonistA with a curious expression . Um , hi ,  ProtagonistA said , feeling a bit awkward . Do ProtagonistA mind if ProtagonistB join ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked . No , ProtagonistA do n't mind ,  ProtagonistA replied . ProtagonistB sat down next to ProtagonistA and they both resumed staring up at the stars . After a few minutes , ProtagonistB spoke again . Do ProtagonistA believe in aliens ?  ProtagonistB asked . ProtagonistA thought for a moment .  ProtagonistA do n't know ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA guess ProtagonistA have n't really thought about it . I do ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB think there 's life out there , somewhere . Maybe they 're looking at us right now , wondering the same thing . ProtagonistA considered this .  Maybe ,  ProtagonistA said .  That would be pretty cool . ProtagonistB smiled .  Yeah , it would . They sat in silence for a while longer , both lost in thought . Then , ProtagonistB stood up . I should probably get going ,  ProtagonistB said .  It was nice meeting ProtagonistA . Yeah , you too ,  ProtagonistA replied . ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB walked away , then turned ProtagonistA's gaze back to the stars . ProtagonistA felt a bit more hopeful now , believing that maybe there was someone out there looking back at ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had had a long day . ProtagonistA was exhausted from all the events that had transpired . First , ProtagonistA had to deal with the courtiers and their never - ending requests . Then , ProtagonistA had to meet with ProtagonistA's advisors to discuss the kingdom 's finances . After that , ProtagonistA had to attend a banquet in ProtagonistA's honor . All ProtagonistA wanted to do now was relax in ProtagonistA's palace by the seaside . ProtagonistA lit a match and put it right between the curtains and the headboard . ProtagonistA watched as the flames grew , licking at the fabric . Soon , the whole room was ablaze . ProtagonistA sat back and watched as ProtagonistA's palace burned to the ground . ProtagonistA felt a sense of relief as ProtagonistA finally allowed ProtagonistA to relax . 
When ProtagonistA was younger , Sunflowers used to duck into the garden every chance ProtagonistA 'd get . ProtagonistA loved the smell of the flowers and the way the sun would make them look . One day , ProtagonistA found a secret garden that no one knew about . It was full of beautiful sunflowers . ProtagonistA spent hours there , admiring the flowers and the way they danced in the breeze . 
ProtagonistA had been waiting all morning for the important piece of paperwork that was going to give ProtagonistB ProtagonistB's retroactive pardon . ProtagonistA had been working on it for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally going to get to see ProtagonistB again . ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA could hardly sit still . Finally , the moment arrived . The paperwork was placed in front of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA signed it with a flourish . Now ProtagonistB was free , and ProtagonistB would be able to come home . ProtagonistA could n't wait to see the look on ProtagonistB's face when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA . It was going to be a happy reunion indeed . 
ProtagonistA had stood by Carol 's side as ProtagonistA worked at sundown on the last day of the year two thousand and eight . It was a beautiful night , and the two women had been working hard all day . They were both exhausted , but they had made it through the day . As they worked , they talked about their plans for the future . They both wanted to make a difference in the world , and they were determined to do so . They were excited for the new year , and they knew that it would be a good one . When they finished their work , they hugged each other and wished each other a happy new year . They both knew that it would be a great one . 
ProtagonistA was over at the office hours , doing ProtagonistA's best hard - boiled egg - and - coconut dish . It was ProtagonistB's favorite , and ProtagonistA was hoping to impress ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's cooking skills . ProtagonistA had spent hours perfecting the recipe , and it was finally ready . ProtagonistA nervously placed the dish in front of ProtagonistB , hoping ProtagonistB would like it . ProtagonistB took a bite , and ProtagonistB's face lit up .  This is amazing , ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistA are a fantastic cook . ProtagonistA was over the moon . ProtagonistA had finally impressed ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's cooking . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would remember ProtagonistA's dish the next time ProtagonistB was looking for a good meal . 
ProtagonistA turned around on ProtagonistA's heels and ran to ProtagonistA's bed , the one ProtagonistA's father had made for ProtagonistA and Princess Celestia , to begin the long process of mourning . It was going to be a long and difficult road ahead , but ProtagonistA was determined to get through it . With ProtagonistA's father gone , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost a part of ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be strong for ProtagonistA's sister . Princess Celestia was going to need ProtagonistA now more than ever . 
ProtagonistA's eyes were heavy with tears as ProtagonistA gazed down at ProtagonistA's hooves . ProtagonistA was filled with thoughts of revenge and escape . It seemed like ProtagonistA could never forget to feel sorry for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had been a captive of the Queen of Hearts for weeks , and ProtagonistA was starting to lose hope . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to be executed soon , and ProtagonistA was determined to take the Queen down with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was going to escape and expose the Queen 's crimes to the world . But first , ProtagonistA had to find a way out of ProtagonistA's prison cell . ProtagonistA spent hours every day trying to find a way to escape , but so far ProtagonistA had been unsuccessful . The Queen had made sure that ProtagonistA's cell was securely locked . But ProtagonistA was not going to give up . ProtagonistA was going to find a way out , even if it killed ProtagonistA . 
One morning , when the sun was bright and the mergansie were jovial , Sunburnt , and the blue - and - white streaked the sky with golden stars and the town of Harmony was bustling with the glee of Times Square , ProtagonistA decided to see ProtagonistB for the first time . ProtagonistA had always wanted to , but never had the time or money . But now , ProtagonistA had neither excuse . ProtagonistA took a bus to ProtagonistB's house , which was a few hours away . When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA was greeted by ProtagonistB . They hugged and cried and laughed , and ProtagonistA was finally able to meet ProtagonistA's grandchildren .

ProtagonistA was herding the ponies to the barn when ProtagonistB approached .  What good dares ProtagonistA do , brother ?  ProtagonistB said .  If ProtagonistA sees ProtagonistB by the pool , ProtagonistA 'll kill the boys !  ProtagonistC was taken aback by ProtagonistB's words . ProtagonistC knew ProtagonistB was joking , but ProtagonistC also knew that ProtagonistC would have to be careful around ProtagonistB from now on . 
ProtagonistA had called to say that ProtagonistA was pregnant , and no one ever said anything like that anymore . ProtagonistA was happy and excited , but ProtagonistA's friends and family just stared at ProtagonistA in disbelief . They all knew that ProtagonistA had been trying to get pregnant for years , but they never thought it would actually happen . Finally , after years of waiting and hoping , ProtagonistA was going to be a mom . 
ProtagonistA had it all -- the perfect job , the perfect friends , and the perfect life . But one day , ProtagonistA realized that something was missing . ProtagonistA did n't have anyone to share ProtagonistA's life with . So , ProtagonistA set out on a journey to find ProtagonistA's soulmate .

They fell in love and got married . And ProtagonistA finally had everything ProtagonistA 'd ever wanted . 
ProtagonistA came into the kitchen to find ProtagonistB reading a journal . ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA and smiled .  Hey , ProtagonistA . What 's up?Nothing much ,  ProtagonistA replied .  Just wanted to see what ProtagonistB were up to . Just reading this old journal ,  ProtagonistB said .  It belonged to ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was a bit of a history buff , and ProtagonistC loved to write . What 's it about ?  ProtagonistA asked . Oh , just some of the things ProtagonistC did during ProtagonistC's life ,  ProtagonistB replied .  ProtagonistC was quite a character , from what ProtagonistB can tell . Can ProtagonistA read it ?  ProtagonistA asked . ProtagonistB hesitated for a moment , then handed the journal over .  Sure , why not ? ProtagonistB think ProtagonistA 'll enjoy it . ProtagonistA sat down at the kitchen table and began to read . The journal was filled with ProtagonistC's thoughts and musings on life , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA quickly absorbed in it . As ProtagonistA read , ProtagonistA could almost feel as if ProtagonistA was there with ProtagonistC , living ProtagonistC's life alongside ProtagonistC . When ProtagonistA finished , ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistB with new respect .  ProtagonistC was an amazing man , was n't he?Her father nodded .  Yes , ProtagonistC was . ProtagonistB 'm glad ProtagonistA got to know ProtagonistC a little bit , through ProtagonistC's journal . ProtagonistA smiled .  ProtagonistA too , ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA too .  
ProtagonistA was a young girl who loved to explore . One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole and decided to follow it . ProtagonistA ended up in a strange place called Wonderland . Here , ProtagonistA met some interesting characters and had some amazing adventures . 
ProtagonistA was just finishing up the last of the cupcakes and had nearly finished ProtagonistA's breakfast when ProtagonistA heard the door open . ProtagonistA knew it was ProtagonistB coming home from ProtagonistB's early morning walk . ProtagonistA went to greet ProtagonistB with a cupcake in hand . Good morning , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA 're up early . I wanted to get a head start on the day ,  said ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA made ProtagonistB a cupcake .

They chatted about their plans for the day and caught up on each other 's news . It was a lovely way to start the day . 
ProtagonistA was in a panic . ProtagonistA was in a strange room and ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA got there . ProtagonistA looked around the room , trying to find a way out . The room was decorated in a very old - fashioned style . There was a large fireplace in one corner and a grand piano in another . The furniture was all very heavy and ornate . ProtagonistA did n't see a door anywhere . ProtagonistA started to feel panicky and claustrophobic . ProtagonistA looked around the room again , desperately searching for a way out . Suddenly , ProtagonistA saw a door in the far corner of the room . ProtagonistA ran to it and tried to open it , but it was locked . ProtagonistA started to feel frantic . ProtagonistA looked around the room one last time and then ProtagonistA saw a key on the mantelpiece . ProtagonistA grabbed it and tried it in the door . It fit and ProtagonistA turned it . The door opened and ProtagonistA ran out of the room , relieved to be free . 
It was the summer day in 1833 that ProtagonistA , was walking ProtagonistA's daughter , Mrs. John Polkiss , down the road , and considering in ProtagonistA's mind whether ProtagonistA should continue to be a single mother , or if ProtagonistA should go back to the family home , and , indeed , if ProtagonistA should , to marry a man . ProtagonistA had been a single mother for six years , and had done quite well for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was starting to feel lonely . ProtagonistA had thought about going back to ProtagonistA's family home , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if they would accept ProtagonistA back , or if they would even want ProtagonistA's daughter there . ProtagonistA had also thought about marrying a man , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA was ready for that either . As ProtagonistA was walking and thinking , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was a handsome man , and ProtagonistA could n't help but stare at ProtagonistB . As ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was John Polkiss , the man ProtagonistA had been thinking about marrying . ProtagonistA stopped and stared at ProtagonistB for a moment , and then ProtagonistA smiled . It was as if fate had brought them together . ProtagonistA knew then that ProtagonistA was ready to marry ProtagonistB , and that ProtagonistA would never be alone again . 
ProtagonistB had always been curious about ProtagonistA's magic powers . ProtagonistB had never seen ProtagonistA use them , but ProtagonistB knew they existed . So , when the day the earth froze , ProtagonistA used the last of ProtagonistA's magic power to reveal to ProtagonistB the greatest secret of all , ProtagonistB was thrilled . ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB how to use ProtagonistA's powers to make the earth freeze and then showed ProtagonistB how to use ProtagonistA's powers to make it thaw . It was an amazing experience for both of them . 
ProtagonistA was on trial for murder . ProtagonistA had killed ProtagonistB after ProtagonistB had cheated on ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's best friend . ProtagonistC was trying to prove that ProtagonistA was not in ProtagonistA's right mind at the time of the murder and that ProtagonistA should be found not guilty by reason of insanity . ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA what had happened on the day of the murder . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistC that ProtagonistA had come home and found ProtagonistB in bed with ProtagonistA's best friend . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had gone into the kitchen and grabbed a knife . ProtagonistA then went back into the bedroom and stabbed ProtagonistB to death . ProtagonistD asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA had killed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistD that ProtagonistA had found a recipe for a poisonous cake on ProtagonistB's computer . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had baked the cake and put it on ProtagonistB's nightstand . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would eat it and that it would kill ProtagonistB . The jury found ProtagonistA not guilty by reason of insanity and ProtagonistA was committed to a mental institution . 
ProtagonistA looked around and noticed that ProtagonistA had disappeared . ProtagonistA was in a white room with no doors or windows . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA got there or how to get out . ProtagonistA started to panic when ProtagonistA heard a voice .  Hello , ProtagonistA . Welcome to the White Room .  
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked at a blank horizon . ProtagonistA had been walking for days , ever since ProtagonistA had been forced to leave ProtagonistA's home . ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , or what ProtagonistA would find when ProtagonistA got there . All ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistA had to keep moving . The sun was beating down on ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was getting thirsty . ProtagonistA had been rationing ProtagonistA's water , but ProtagonistA was almost out . ProtagonistA was about to get up and keep walking when ProtagonistA heard a sound in the distance . It sounded like someone was coming . ProtagonistA quickly hid behind a nearby bush and waited . ProtagonistA could hear the sound of footsteps getting closer and closer . Soon , ProtagonistB came into view . ProtagonistB was walking quickly , and ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was in a hurry . ProtagonistA was about to call out to ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA saw the look on ProtagonistB's face . ProtagonistB looked scared , and ProtagonistB was carrying a gun . ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistB was being chased by someone . ProtagonistA waited until ProtagonistB was closer , and then ProtagonistA jumped out and grabbed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA pulled ProtagonistB behind the bush and waited . Soon , ProtagonistA could hear the sound of someone else coming . They were shouting and getting closer . ProtagonistA peeked out from behind the bush and saw two men . They were both carrying guns , and they looked like they were about to kill ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do something . ProtagonistA jumped out from behind the bush and yelled at the men to stop . They both turned and looked at ProtagonistA . For a moment , they were both surprised . ProtagonistA used that moment to ProtagonistA's advantage . ProtagonistA ran towards the men and tackled one of them to the ground . ProtagonistC tried to shoot ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was too quick . ProtagonistA knocked the gun out of ProtagonistC's hand and punched ProtagonistC in the face . The two men were both down , but ProtagonistA knew they were n't going to stay down for long . ProtagonistA grabbed ProtagonistB and started to run . ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get away from those men . 
ProtagonistA's name was ProtagonistA , and forever after , even now when I regret not having the courage to ask ProtagonistA's name , I will not forget ProtagonistA's dark face when ProtagonistA looked up at me with such wonder and such complete and utter confusion . There was something in ProtagonistA's eyes that seemed to say ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistA's home again . I can still see the fear and the sadness in ProtagonistA's face , and it haunts me to this day . 
ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistA's eyes peeled for anything out of the ordinary , but ProtagonistA was doing ProtagonistA best to ignore the odd look the look of interest was giving ProtagonistA . It was clear that ProtagonistB was interested in ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA was interested in ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA did n't want to give ProtagonistB the wrong impression , so ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to avoid eye contact . However , ProtagonistB was persistent , and eventually ProtagonistA relented and gave ProtagonistB a small smile . It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship . 
ProtagonistA stood up and trotted across the grass , trotted down a short flight of steps and to the door of the cottage ProtagonistA had recently moved into . The door was slightly ajar , and ProtagonistA could hear voices coming from inside . ProtagonistA pushed the door open a bit further and peeked inside . There were two people inside , ProtagonistC and ProtagonistB , and they were arguing . ProtagonistB was crying , and ProtagonistC was yelling . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , so ProtagonistA just stood there and watched . After a few minutes , ProtagonistC stormed out of the cottage , slamming the door behind ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB collapsed onto the floor , sobbing . ProtagonistA felt bad for ProtagonistB , so ProtagonistA walked into the cottage and went over to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA helped ProtagonistB up and sat ProtagonistB down in a chair . ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA , and they began to talk . ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistB's name was Sarah , and ProtagonistB had just moved into the cottage too . ProtagonistB had been arguing with ProtagonistD , and ProtagonistB was upset because ProtagonistD had just moved out . ProtagonistA comforted ProtagonistB and told ProtagonistB that everything would be alright . ProtagonistB smiled and thanked ProtagonistA again . Then ProtagonistB got up and went to bed . ProtagonistA went home , thinking about what had happened . ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had been there to help ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA vowed to always be a good friend to ProtagonistB . 
Stow had been accustomed to being the first one out of the house at the most inconvenient hours of the day . So , when ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA standing upright before Alice 's book - tables in the late afternoon , ProtagonistA looked around the vast space with the air of a man who had been long since back in England . It was clear that ProtagonistA was not welcome here . But ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA had been planning this moment for years . And now , finally , ProtagonistA was going to get ProtagonistA's revenge . 
ProtagonistA had been going through a bad patch of writing for a few weeks now , but if the last few months had gone by ProtagonistA had not long since come to the realisation that the final word on ProtagonistA's work was not always the most important . ProtagonistA had been through ups and downs with ProtagonistA writing before , and ProtagonistA knew that this too shall pass . ProtagonistA just had to keep plugging away and eventually the words would come . 
ProtagonistA stood up and trotted through the gardens , running up the side of a hill and across the grass , until ProtagonistA reached the top of a bluff above the water 's surface . There , ProtagonistA found a small boat waiting for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA climbed in and rowed out to the center of the lake , where ProtagonistA let the boat drift and watched the sun set . 
ProtagonistA got home and found that ProtagonistA's house was cold and dark . The only light was coming from the castle , and the dog that ran in and out of the room was quite a bother . ProtagonistA tried to ignore the dog and went to the castle to see what was going on . 
ProtagonistA stood on ProtagonistA's rock and stared into the water . It was so clear that ProtagonistA could see the bottom . ProtagonistA could see the fish swimming around . ProtagonistA could see the plants moving in the water . ProtagonistA could even see the rocks on the bottom . ProtagonistA was so fascinated by what ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistA's mom calling ProtagonistA for dinner . 
ProtagonistA was having a hard time deciding whether to take ProtagonistA's first trip home or not . ProtagonistA had always wanted to travel , but ProtagonistA was also very attached to ProtagonistA's home and ProtagonistA's family . ProtagonistA thought about all of the amazing places ProtagonistA could see and the new people ProtagonistA could meet , but ProtagonistA also thought about how much ProtagonistA would miss ProtagonistA's loved ones at home . In the end , ProtagonistA decided to take the trip and ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA had an incredible time and ProtagonistA was able to see so many new things , but ProtagonistA was also happy to be home at the end of it all . 
ProtagonistA is my best friend . ProtagonistA does n't remember me being born but ProtagonistA 's right ; I have the best hooves on the staff of Everfree . The best in magic . And ProtagonistA really likes me , but that does n't bother ProtagonistA much anymore . I was born in the heart of Everfree forest , surrounded by magic . My mother was a great sorceress and my father was the king of the forest . From the moment I was born , it was clear that I was special . I had a gift for magic that was unlike anything anyone had ever seen before . ProtagonistA was there for me from the very beginning . ProtagonistA was my first friend and ProtagonistA 's been by my side ever since . ProtagonistA 's seen me at my best and my worst , and ProtagonistA still loves me unconditionally . Even though ProtagonistA does n't remember it , ProtagonistA was there the day I was born . ProtagonistA was the one who found me in the forest and brought me back to the castle . ProtagonistA 's been my best friend ever since . 
ProtagonistA had been married to ProtagonistC for several weeks when ProtagonistA heard that ProtagonistB was expecting a baby . ProtagonistA was overjoyed for ProtagonistB and could n't wait to meet the new addition to the family . However , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little jealous . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC had been trying to conceive for a while now without any luck . ProtagonistA knew that it was n't ProtagonistB's fault , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel envious . Still , ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB and was excited to be an aunt . ProtagonistA was determined to help ProtagonistB in any way ProtagonistA could , and ProtagonistA knew that the baby would bring them all even closer together . 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day . First , ProtagonistA woke up late and had to rush to get ready for ProtagonistA's day . Then , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had forgotten to do ProtagonistA's homework the night before . When ProtagonistA got to school , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's lunch at home . To top it all off , ProtagonistA's best friend was mad at ProtagonistA for something ProtagonistA had said the day before . ProtagonistA was feeling really down by the time lunch period came around . ProtagonistA sat down on the ground , ProtagonistA's tail turning to one side and ProtagonistA's eyes closed , and tried to forget about ProtagonistA's troubles . Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt something soft and warm nudge ProtagonistA's arm . ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes to see ProtagonistB sitting next to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB had always been a loyal friend , and ProtagonistB could tell that ProtagonistA was having a tough day . ProtagonistB sat with ProtagonistA until ProtagonistA felt better , and then went on ProtagonistB's way . ProtagonistA was grateful to ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's support and friendship . ProtagonistA knew that no matter what , ProtagonistB would always be there for ProtagonistA . 
Mare slits the muzzle of ProtagonistB's gun into the air and lets out a little whine of Oops ! around the top of ProtagonistA's throat . ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA should n't have been playing with the gun , but it was so tempting . Now ProtagonistB is going to be so mad . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's saddle and looked around the sea , sliding ProtagonistA's hooves gently through the pegasus 's smooth underbelly . The sun was setting , and the sky was a beautiful orange . ProtagonistA felt at peace , and ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes , letting the wind blow through ProtagonistA's hair . 
ProtagonistA looked up from the book ProtagonistA was reading , and the tear - streaked blue of ProtagonistA's eyes seemed to say ,  she think we both know what we 're in for .  It was clear that ProtagonistA was not enjoying the book , but ProtagonistA was determined to finish it . ProtagonistA had started it weeks ago , and it was now the only thing ProtagonistA had left to read . The book was a romance novel , and it was full of cliches and unrealistic dialogue . ProtagonistA had been hoping for a good , heart - wrenching story , but instead ProtagonistA got a book that was full of fluff . ProtagonistA was about halfway through , and ProtagonistA was starting to lose hope that the story would get any better . Still , ProtagonistA persisted . ProtagonistA had come this far , and ProtagonistA was not going to give up now . Maybe the ending would be worth it , ProtagonistA thought . Maybe the book would surprise ProtagonistA . Alas , it was not to be . The book ended exactly as ProtagonistA had expected it to : with a cheesy , happy ending that left ProtagonistA's feeling angry and disappointed . ProtagonistA threw the book across the room , and it hit the wall with a thud . ProtagonistA was done with romance novels . ProtagonistA was done with books that promised ProtagonistA a good story and then delivered nothing but fluff . From now on , ProtagonistA was only going to read books that were actually worth ProtagonistA's time . 
ProtagonistA's hooves stopped pounding the dirt beside the bank , and ProtagonistA's eyes once more settled on the horizon . ProtagonistA had been running for what felt like hours , ever since ProtagonistA had seen the fire in the distance . Now , ProtagonistA was close enough to see the flames licking at the sky , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistA's family . ProtagonistA had no idea where they were , but ProtagonistA knew they would be looking for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had to find them before the fire did . ProtagonistA started to run again , ProtagonistA's hooves pounding the ground as ProtagonistA went . ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistA's family . The fire was getting closer , and ProtagonistA could feel the heat on ProtagonistA's skin . ProtagonistA ran faster , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest . ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistA's family before the fire consumed them . ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA would do if ProtagonistA lost them . The flames were getting closer , and ProtagonistA could see the smoke billowing into the sky . ProtagonistA ran faster , ProtagonistA's lungs burning with the effort . ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistA's family before it was too late . Suddenly , ProtagonistA saw them . They were huddled together , their eyes wide with fear . ProtagonistA ran to them , and they gathered around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was safe now . ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's family . 
The first time we met ProtagonistA , in a dream , ProtagonistA had gone there alone . It was a strange place , full of creatures that ProtagonistA had never seen before . ProtagonistA was scared at first , but then ProtagonistA saw us . We were a group of friends , all gathered together in this strange place . We welcomed ProtagonistA and showed ProtagonistA around . We showed ProtagonistA all the different areas of the dream world and introduced ProtagonistA to all the different creatures . ProtagonistA was amazed and delighted by everything ProtagonistA saw . We became fast friends and would often meet in that strange place , in our dreams . 
ProtagonistA watched the sunset from the window of ProtagonistA's room at the end of the house . ProtagonistA's fingers pressed the slender small mirror against the tabletop in the middle of the room . In the mirror , ProtagonistA could see the sun setting behind the trees . The sky was a beautiful orange , and the clouds were a deep pink . ProtagonistA felt a warmth in ProtagonistA's heart as ProtagonistA watched the sun set . ProtagonistA was grateful for the beautiful moment . 
ProtagonistA had never imagined that ProtagonistA would be one of the subject matter of such a search , but even now it seemed that ProtagonistA was holding onto something which perhaps ProtagonistA was n't entirely comfortable with . ProtagonistA knew that what ProtagonistA was doing was wrong , but ProtagonistA could n't help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was addicted to the thrill of the chase , and the feeling of power that came with it . Even now , as ProtagonistA sat in the interrogation room , ProtagonistA felt a sense of excitement . This was it , ProtagonistA was finally going to be caught . But even as the police officers read out ProtagonistA's list of crimes , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a sense of pride . ProtagonistA had outsmarted them for so long , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to get ProtagonistA's comeuppance . But as ProtagonistA was led away to ProtagonistA's cell , ProtagonistA could n't help but wonder if this was really the end . After all , ProtagonistA had always been a survivor . Perhaps this was just another challenge for ProtagonistA to overcome . 
It 's all right , ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA said so sweetly , that ProtagonistA's hooves shook the paper as ProtagonistA said it . ProtagonistB was so scared when ProtagonistB saw the big , mean dog , but ProtagonistA was there to protect ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA 's always there for ProtagonistB , just like ProtagonistB's mom . 
ProtagonistA , was sitting in ProtagonistA's room looking at the stars . ProtagonistA had a thought that in a country that had been ProtagonistA's own for so long , very little would be left to ProtagonistA if anything happened . ProtagonistA would have no one to protect ProtagonistA . This thought bored ProtagonistA beyond measure . 
One morning ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's doubts again . ProtagonistA was unsure if ProtagonistA wanted to go to ProtagonistA's job or if ProtagonistA wanted to quit and find something new . ProtagonistA thought about all of the things ProtagonistA did n't like about ProtagonistA's job and how ProtagonistA felt so unfulfilled . ProtagonistA thought about how ProtagonistA was always so tired and how ProtagonistA never had any time for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA thought about how ProtagonistA was always stressed and how ProtagonistA never felt like ProtagonistA was doing anything that mattered . As ProtagonistA thought about all of these things , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been putting off making a decision for far too long . It was time to either commit to ProtagonistA's job or to find something new . ProtagonistA knew that whatever ProtagonistA decided , it would be a big change . But ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA was ready for a change . 
ProtagonistA was back at the bank , shuffling ProtagonistA's feet as ProtagonistA waited with bated breath for the check to come in . ProtagonistA had been waiting for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had been laid off from ProtagonistA's job . The check was ProtagonistA's last hope . Finally , the check came in . ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief as ProtagonistA deposited it into ProtagonistA's account . With the money , ProtagonistA would be able to pay ProtagonistA's rent and buy food . ProtagonistA was grateful for the help , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit humiliated . ProtagonistA had never thought ProtagonistA would be in this position . 
ProtagonistA looked around , minding ProtagonistA's own business , when ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA face to face with a sniping unicorn . ProtagonistA was so startled that ProtagonistA jumped back and hit ProtagonistA's head on a tree . When ProtagonistA came to , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a strange place . The unicorn was gone and ProtagonistA was surrounded by tall , imposing trees . ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's feet and began to walk , not knowing where ProtagonistA was or how ProtagonistA would get home . After a while , ProtagonistA came to a clearing and in the center was a beautiful castle . ProtagonistA walked up to it and knocked on the door . When no one answered , ProtagonistA walked in . ProtagonistA explore the castle and eventually came to a room that was filled with treasure . ProtagonistA also found a door that led outside . ProtagonistA went back to the room with the treasure and began to fill ProtagonistA's pockets with as much as ProtagonistA could carry . ProtagonistA then went back outside and began the long walk home . 
ProtagonistA lifted ProtagonistA's head , and peered out over the horizon . ProtagonistA could see the sun just beginning to peek over the edge , and the sky was a beautiful orange . ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and calm wash over ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and took a deep breath . It was going to be a good day . 
ProtagonistA has been slowly moping ProtagonistA's hooves through the blizzard of paperwork that is the letter from the Apple family . ProtagonistA knew that they were going to be upset , but ProtagonistA did n't expect them to be this upset . ProtagonistA has been getting more and more letters from them lately , and each one is more angry than the last . ProtagonistA does n't know what ProtagonistA did to deserve this , but ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA needs to find a way to make it stop . 
ProtagonistA sat by ProtagonistA's friends , watching them , and looking around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt so alone , even though ProtagonistA was surrounded by people . ProtagonistA did n't know how to connect with them , and ProtagonistA did n't know how to make friends . ProtagonistA just sat there , watching them , and feeling left out . 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's bedroom , writing a letter to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was telling ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's day and how ProtagonistA had made a new friend at school . ProtagonistA was excited to tell ProtagonistB all about ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA hoped that ProtagonistB would be able to come and visit soon . 
ProtagonistA thrashed about on all fours , helping ProtagonistA's hooves through the dusty soil like a frightened child . ProtagonistA had never felt so scared in ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA had been out in the pasture all day , and now , it was getting dark . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should go back to the barn , but ProtagonistA was afraid of what might happen if ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA had seen the other horses go in there , and they never came out . ProtagonistA did n't want to end up like them . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise that made ProtagonistA's heart race . It sounded like something was coming towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA tried to run , but ProtagonistA's hooves would n't move . ProtagonistA was frozen in fear . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and waited for whatever was coming for ProtagonistA . Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt something warm and soft touch ProtagonistA's nose . ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes to see a horse standing in front of ProtagonistA . It was the most beautiful horse ProtagonistA had ever seen . It was a pure white , and it had a mane and tail that flowed in the wind . It looked like an angel . The horse nickered softly and nuzzled ProtagonistA's nose . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's fear melting away . ProtagonistA stood up and followed the horse back to the barn . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was safe now . 
ProtagonistA had been meaning to write to ProtagonistB for a long time , but ProtagonistA was beginning to get tired of waiting . ProtagonistA had so much to say to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB dearly . Finally , ProtagonistA decided to take matters into ProtagonistA's own hands and write the letter ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA hope this letter finds ProtagonistB well . ProtagonistA 've been meaning to write to ProtagonistB for a long time , but ProtagonistA 'm not sure if ProtagonistB ever got ProtagonistA's previous letters . ProtagonistA 'm sorry for not keeping in better touch , but ProtagonistA 've been really busy lately . ProtagonistA miss ProtagonistB a lot , and ProtagonistA hope we can catch up soon . Love , ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had always been a bridesmaid ; ProtagonistA's father had promised a wedding for ProtagonistA and had lived up to that . However , when ProtagonistA's father died , ProtagonistA was left with no husband and no wedding . ProtagonistA was forced to move in with ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle , who were not very fond of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was very lonely and felt like ProtagonistA had lost everything . One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had been married to ProtagonistA's best friend , who had died in a car accident . ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA became friends and eventually got married . ProtagonistA was finally able to have the wedding ProtagonistA always wanted , and ProtagonistA was very happy . 
The fire had not yet subsided from the ruins of the old slum when ProtagonistA stood in the doorway of the house where I grew up . ProtagonistA's parents had died in the fire , and ProtagonistA was all alone in the world . ProtagonistA had nowhere to go and no one to turn to . I took ProtagonistA in and cared for ProtagonistA as if ProtagonistA were my own daughter . I loved ProtagonistA like ProtagonistA was my own flesh and blood . Even though the fire had destroyed everything ProtagonistA had , ProtagonistA was still standing . ProtagonistA was a survivor . 
ProtagonistA was walking home from ProtagonistA's friend 's house late one night when ProtagonistA noticed the moon glittered behind ProtagonistA , like a crystal ball of light . ProtagonistA stopped and stared at it for a moment , mesmerized by its beauty . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise behind ProtagonistA and turned around to see a large , black cat walking towards ProtagonistA . The cat seemed to be staring at the moon too , and then it began to speak to ProtagonistA in a soft , calming voice . Hello , ProtagonistA . Is n't the moon beautiful tonight?Alice was so startled that ProtagonistA could n't speak for a moment . Then ProtagonistA regained ProtagonistA's composure and replied ,  Yes , it is . It 's so bright and pretty . Yes , it is . And it 's also very magical . Just like ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA . The cat continued to walk towards ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA took a step back , not sure what to make of this situation . Was the cat really talking to ProtagonistA ? And what did it mean by saying ProtagonistA was magical?Before ProtagonistA could say anything else , the cat rubbed against ProtagonistA's leg and then jumped up into ProtagonistA's arms . ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA could n't move . Now , let 's go explore the magic of the moon together , shall we?And with that , the cat led ProtagonistA away into the night . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked down at a firm blank horizon . ProtagonistA had been walking for days , ever since ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's home in the forest . ProtagonistA was tired , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore , but ProtagonistA kept walking . ProtagonistA was looking for something , though ProtagonistA did n't know what it was . ProtagonistA just knew ProtagonistA needed to find it . As ProtagonistA sat there , ProtagonistA saw a small dot on the horizon . It was getting closer and closer , and ProtagonistA could soon make out what it was . It was a bird , flying towards ProtagonistA . As it got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was a raven . It landed on the ground in front of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA looked at it curiously . The raven spoke to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was surprised to understand what it was saying .  ProtagonistA 're looking for something , ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistA wo n't find it out there . ProtagonistA need to go home . ProtagonistA thought about what the raven had said . It made sense . ProtagonistA was tired and sore , and ProtagonistA was n't going to find whatever it was ProtagonistA was looking for out there . ProtagonistA thanked the raven , and turned around to head back home . 
ProtagonistA had just gotten off work when ProtagonistA was kidnapped by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was thrown into the back of a van and driven to an unknown location . When the van stopped , ProtagonistA was dragged out and thrown into a dark room . ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB breathing heavily in the darkness . Suddenly , a light was turned on and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB's face . ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's boss ! ProtagonistB had always been creepy , but ProtagonistA never thought ProtagonistB would kidnap ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA tried to scream , but ProtagonistB covered ProtagonistA's mouth with ProtagonistB's hand .  If ProtagonistA make a sound , ProtagonistB 'll kill ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said . ProtagonistA was terrified . ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistB was going to do to ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA's emails felt for the beast , but ProtagonistA 'd never seen it touch a living thing before . ProtagonistA was beginning to feel like ProtagonistA was the only one it ever had contact with . ProtagonistA was its only friend . One day , ProtagonistA came into the room and the beast was gone . ProtagonistA felt a pang of sadness , but also relief . ProtagonistA did n't know how to care for it and was afraid of it . Now ProtagonistA could go back to ProtagonistA's normal life . 
ProtagonistA was up early as usual , trying to get a head start on ProtagonistA's day . ProtagonistA had a lot of errands to run and did n't want to waste any time . As ProtagonistA was walking through town , ProtagonistA saw the Ponyville library and decided to stop in . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should n't , but ProtagonistA could n't help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA walked in and started looking for ProtagonistA's favorite book . ProtagonistA did n't see it anywhere and was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw it on the top shelf . ProtagonistA reached for it , but it was just out of ProtagonistA's reach . ProtagonistA looked around to see if anyone was watching and then boosted ProtagonistA up onto the shelf . ProtagonistA grabbed the book and then quickly climbed down . ProtagonistA put the book back in its place and then hurried out of the library . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be more careful in the future or ProtagonistA would get caught . 
ProtagonistA hoped that they would be okay . At least ProtagonistA said so as ProtagonistA rested ProtagonistA's hoof on the end of ProtagonistB's hoof . ProtagonistB appreciated the support and understanding , but ProtagonistB was still worried . ProtagonistB could n't help but worry about the future and what it might hold . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was worried and ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to try and comfort ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that it was n't easy to be in ProtagonistB's position . ProtagonistB was the one who had to make the decisions and ProtagonistB was the one who had to worry about the future . But ProtagonistA was there for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA would support ProtagonistB no matter what happened . 
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA came across a horse . The horse was shaking its head and ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head too . The horse then shook its hoof and ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head again . Suddenly , the horse started to speak .  Why are ProtagonistA shaking ProtagonistA's head ?  the horse asked .  ProtagonistA 'm not shaking ProtagonistA's head ,  ProtagonistA replied .  ProtagonistA 'm shaking ProtagonistA's hoof .  
ProtagonistA's imagination was an echo of ProtagonistA's senses and a recording of ProtagonistA's thoughts . ProtagonistA could replay memories like they were movies , and ProtagonistA could even make up ProtagonistA's own stories . Sometimes , ProtagonistA would imagine ProtagonistA as a character in a book , and ProtagonistA would live out the adventure in ProtagonistA's mind . Other times , ProtagonistA would be a musician , playing to a crowd of adoring fans . It was always a fun game to see how far ProtagonistA's imagination could take ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA knew everything , and yet there was much ProtagonistA knew nothing about . ProtagonistA was always the top of ProtagonistA's class , the teacher 's favorite , and ProtagonistA had never been challenged . That is , until ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was the new kid in school and ProtagonistB was smart , really smart . ProtagonistB knew things that ProtagonistA had never even heard of before . ProtagonistA was fascinated by ProtagonistB and quickly became ProtagonistB's friend . Over time , ProtagonistA learned more and more from ProtagonistB and realized that there was a whole world of knowledge out there that ProtagonistA had never even imagined . ProtagonistA was no longer the smartest person in the room , but ProtagonistA was okay with that because ProtagonistA was learning so much . Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB , for showing ProtagonistA that there was always more to learn . 
ProtagonistA had been out all day , exploring the kingdom with ProtagonistA's mer - dog in tow . ProtagonistA was getting tired , and the sun was beginning to set . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to head home soon . As ProtagonistA was walking , ProtagonistA heard a faint noise in the distance . It sounded like music . ProtagonistA followed the sound until ProtagonistA came to a clearing in the forest . There , ProtagonistA saw a group of animals playing music . There was a fiddle - playing fox , a trumpet - playing deer , and a bear playing the drums . They were all so good ! ProtagonistA sat down and listened to them play . Eventually , ProtagonistA got too tired and had to go home . But ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA had found the music - makers in the forest . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would always remember this magical moment . 
ProtagonistA sat down on the edge of the bank , crossed ProtagonistA's legs , and stared out into the sea . ProtagonistA had always loved the ocean , even though ProtagonistA had never been able to swim in it . ProtagonistA loved the way it looked like a never - ending abyss , and the way the waves crashed against the shore . It was always so peaceful to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA sat there for a while , just letting ProtagonistA's mind wander . ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's life and how it had been so different from what ProtagonistA had expected . ProtagonistA had always thought ProtagonistA would be married with kids by now , but it just had n't happened . ProtagonistA was n't even close to finding the right person . ProtagonistA sighed and shook ProtagonistA's head , trying to push those thoughts out of ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA looked back out at the ocean and saw a dolphin jump out of the water . ProtagonistA smiled and watched it for a while before standing up and dusting off ProtagonistA's pants . ProtagonistA was feeling a little better now , and ProtagonistA decided to go for a walk . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's rock and blinked ProtagonistA's eyes , wondering how to get back to reality . ProtagonistA had been in this strange place for what felt like days , and ProtagonistA was starting to get worried . ProtagonistA had tried everything ProtagonistA could think of to get back home , but nothing had worked . ProtagonistA was just about to give up when ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB looked familiar , but ProtagonistA could n't quite place ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA , it 's me , John . ProtagonistB 've been looking for ProtagonistA everywhere . ProtagonistB 'm so glad ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was confused . ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistB seemed to know ProtagonistA . Where are we ? What is this place ?  ProtagonistA asked . This is the place between life and death . ProtagonistB 've been stuck here for years , ever since ProtagonistB's car accident . But ProtagonistB finally found a way out and ProtagonistB came to find ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was still confused , but ProtagonistA was also starting to feel hopeful . Maybe ProtagonistB could help ProtagonistA get back to reality . Come with ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'll show ProtagonistA the way out . ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's hand and followed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had nothing to lose at this point . Together , they walked through the strange place , until they finally came to a door . ProtagonistB opened it and gestured for ProtagonistA to go through . ProtagonistA hesitated again , but then ProtagonistA took a deep breath and stepped through . When ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA back in ProtagonistA's own bedroom . ProtagonistA blinked ProtagonistA's eyes , wondering if it was all just a dream . But then ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing next to ProtagonistA , looking just as surprised as ProtagonistA was . It worked !  ProtagonistB exclaimed . ProtagonistA could n't believe it . ProtagonistA was really back in reality . ProtagonistA hugged ProtagonistB , tears of joy streaming down ProtagonistA's face . Thank ProtagonistB so much for finding ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said . Don't thank ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB replied .  Thank ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 're the one who found the way out .  
ProtagonistA was quietly trying to get to ProtagonistA's feet when ProtagonistA heard a sharp screech . ProtagonistA turned around and saw a large bird flying towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA tried to run away , but the bird was too fast . It grabbed ProtagonistA with its talons and flew away with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA screamed for help , but no one was around to hear ProtagonistA . The bird flew into a dark cave and dropped ProtagonistA onto the ground . ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was surrounded by bones . The bird flew back out of the cave and left ProtagonistA alone . ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA sat down and cried . 
ProtagonistA stood at the edge of the rocky pinnacle , ProtagonistA's hooves glinting in the morning sunlight . ProtagonistA looked out over the vast kingdom below ProtagonistA and sighed . It was time to end ProtagonistA's reign . ProtagonistA had ruled for centuries , and seen many changes come to ProtagonistA's kingdom . But now it was time to pass the torch to the next generation . ProtagonistA turned and walked back to ProtagonistA's castle , ProtagonistA's head held high . 
ProtagonistA was out for a ride on ProtagonistA's black mare when ProtagonistA suddenly felt a fierce thirst . ProtagonistA pulled up on the reins and dismounted , then led the mare to a nearby stream to drink . As ProtagonistA watched the mare drink , ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's own thirst begin to grow . ProtagonistA knelt down and scooped up a handful of water , then drank deeply . As ProtagonistA sat there , ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's body begin to relax and ProtagonistA's mind begin to clear . It was as if the water from the stream was washing away all ProtagonistA's worries and concerns . ProtagonistA sat there for a long time , just watching the mare drink and feeling the peace of the moment . 
ProtagonistA had been living in the fort for a few months now , and ProtagonistA loved it . It was so different from ProtagonistA's life back in the city . ProtagonistA was always on the go , and ProtagonistA never had time to just sit and relax . But here , ProtagonistA could do whatever ProtagonistA wanted . ProtagonistA could sit in the dining room and enjoy ProtagonistA's meal , or ProtagonistA could go for a walk around the grounds . It was perfect . Tonight , ProtagonistA had decided to stay in and have a quiet dinner . ProtagonistA slipped into the dining room and sat down at the table . ProtagonistA looked around the room , taking in the white walls and the low table . It was so peaceful here . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could just sit and relax forever . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise outside . It sounded like someone was walking around the fort . ProtagonistA got up from the table and went to the window to see who it was . It was one of the other residents . ProtagonistA waved to them , and they waved back . Then ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistA's dinner . ProtagonistA was just about to take a bite of ProtagonistA's food when ProtagonistA heard the noise again . This time , it sounded like someone was trying to break into the fort . ProtagonistA got up and ran to the door . ProtagonistA opened it just in time to see a man trying to break in . ProtagonistA screamed , and the man ran away . ProtagonistA was shaken , but ProtagonistA was okay . ProtagonistA went back to the dining room and finished ProtagonistA's dinner . ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had decided to stay in tonight . It was definitely a night ProtagonistA would never forget . 
There was once , in the sparsely - settled setting of the stone town of Golden ProtagonistA sat , ProtagonistA's eyes closed and listening to the sounds of the surrounding woods . It was a peaceful day , with a gentle breeze blowing through the trees and the sun shining down on the small town . ProtagonistA was content to sit and listen to the natural sounds of the world around ProtagonistA , letting ProtagonistA's mind wander . ProtagonistA thought of the people in the town and how they all seemed to be content with their lives . ProtagonistA thought of the animals in the woods and how they must be enjoying the sunny day . ProtagonistA even thought of the plants , how they must be basking in the warm sunlight . All of these thoughts brought a smile to ProtagonistA's face . 
 What are ProtagonistA looking at , ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB peered over ProtagonistA's shoulder at ProtagonistA .  It 's a picture of ProtagonistA's family ,  ProtagonistA replied .  They 're all so happy .   They look it ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB wish ProtagonistB could have a family like that .   ProtagonistB can , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistB 're part of ProtagonistA's family now .  
ProtagonistA took a deep breath , then ProtagonistA's horn : the thrall of ambition . ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a professional musician , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to make ProtagonistA's dream a reality . ProtagonistA had been practicing for years , and ProtagonistA was confident in ProtagonistA's abilities . ProtagonistA was going to make it , no matter what . The audition was for a spot in the symphony orchestra , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was up against some stiff competition . But ProtagonistA was determined to give it ProtagonistA all . ProtagonistA played ProtagonistA's piece flawlessly , and when ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had nailed it . Now ProtagonistA just had to wait for the results . ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA would get the job , but ProtagonistA did n't want to get ProtagonistA hopes up too much . ProtagonistA would just have to wait and see . 
The day ProtagonistB first met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was four and a half years old . ProtagonistA was a little girl with blonde hair and blue eyes . ProtagonistA was wearing a pink dress and ProtagonistA had a doll in ProtagonistA's hand . ProtagonistA was the most beautiful thing ProtagonistB had ever seen . ProtagonistB did n't know who ProtagonistA was , but ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB wanted to be ProtagonistA's friend . ProtagonistB walked up to ProtagonistA and said ,  Hi , ProtagonistB's name is ProtagonistB . What 's ProtagonistA's name ?  ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's big blue eyes and said ,  ProtagonistA's name is Alice .  ProtagonistB smiled and said ,  That 's a pretty name . Do ProtagonistA want to be friends ?  ProtagonistA nodded ProtagonistA's head and held out ProtagonistA's hand . ProtagonistB took it and ProtagonistA shook hands . ProtagonistA were friends from that day forward . 
Sweetie-6 was sitting in the park , watching the children play . ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB .  Are n't ProtagonistB going to go home ? said Sweetie-6 , scratching ProtagonistA's head .  ProtagonistB shrugged ProtagonistB's shoulders and said that ProtagonistB did n't know . Sweetie-6 told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB should go home , because it was getting late . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB did n't want to go home , because ProtagonistB did n't want to be alone . Sweetie-6 told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB could come and sit with ProtagonistA for a while , and then ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistB's home . ProtagonistB agreed , and the two of them sat in the park together until it was time for ProtagonistB to go home . 
ProtagonistA was brushing ProtagonistB's hair as the sun rose over the sky . ProtagonistB neighed softly as ProtagonistA ran the brush through ProtagonistB's mane . ProtagonistA smiled as ProtagonistA worked , thinking of the days when ProtagonistA would go for rides with ProtagonistA's father on his horse . Those were the days when ProtagonistA was carefree and happy . Now , ProtagonistA was a grown woman with responsibilities . But ProtagonistA still loved spending time with ProtagonistB . It was a special bond that ProtagonistA cherished . 
ProtagonistA had been living in the land for many years , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB had been a force in its history . ProtagonistA remembered the stories that ProtagonistB had told ProtagonistA about the land and its people . ProtagonistA also remembered the times when ProtagonistB had helped ProtagonistA to understand the land and its ways . Even though ProtagonistB had passed away a few years before , ProtagonistA had not forgotten ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA's father had been waiting for ProtagonistA for hours . It was getting late , and the moon was already high in the sky . ProtagonistA had gone out for a walk and gotten lost . ProtagonistA's father was getting worried . Finally , ProtagonistA showed up . ProtagonistA was tired and dirty , but ProtagonistA was safe . ProtagonistA's father was relieved . They went home and went to bed . 
ProtagonistA was the daughter of a statistician in Champlain . After ProtagonistA's father died , ProtagonistA was left to fend for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA managed to get four years of education and learn some useful skills . When ProtagonistA was older , ProtagonistA became a carpenter , hatter , and office seeker . ProtagonistA was very successful in ProtagonistA's work and helped many people . 
ProtagonistA stood on ProtagonistA's hind legs , took a long breath , and then let out a loud , long howl . ProtagonistA had been feeling cooped up lately and needed to let off some steam . ProtagonistA's owner , understanding ProtagonistA's needs , had taken ProtagonistA to the park for a run . Now , with the wind in ProtagonistA's fur and the sun on ProtagonistA's face , ProtagonistA felt alive . ProtagonistA ran and played until ProtagonistA was exhausted , then flopped down on the grass , panting and happy . 
ProtagonistA gave a hoof and ProtagonistA's ears , a slight twitching . It was time to go . ProtagonistA had been in this place for far too long and ProtagonistA was starting to get antsy . ProtagonistA had been here since ProtagonistA was a filly and it was time to move on . ProtagonistA did n't know what was out there , but ProtagonistA was sure that it was better than this . ProtagonistA had been born in this place and ProtagonistA had never left . ProtagonistA had never even seen the outside . ProtagonistA had heard stories from the other horses , but ProtagonistA did n't really believe them . It sounded too good to be true . But ProtagonistA was going to find out for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA started to walk towards the door and the other horses started to whinny and stamp their feet . They were excited for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was the first one to ever leave . ProtagonistA walked out the door and into the sunlight . ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA's eyes . It was so beautiful . ProtagonistA started to gallop and ProtagonistA felt free for the first time in ProtagonistA's life . 
ProtagonistA had always known that ProtagonistA had a lot of talent . ProtagonistA had always been good at art and music , and ProtagonistA was always able to make friends easily . But ProtagonistA never realized how much talent ProtagonistA really had until ProtagonistA went to college . ProtagonistA was studying art history , and ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA was better at it than most of ProtagonistA's classmates . ProtagonistA started getting good grades and was even asked to give a few lectures . ProtagonistA was also asked to join the college choir , and ProtagonistA quickly became one of the best singers . ProtagonistA was surprised at how much talent ProtagonistA had . ProtagonistA always thought ProtagonistA was just average , but it turns out ProtagonistA was actually quite gifted . ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA finally found ProtagonistA's niche and was able to excel in something ProtagonistA loved . 
ProtagonistA pranced through the air , bouncing on ProtagonistA's wings , ProtagonistA's hooves floating in the swirling air . ProtagonistA felt weightless and free , like ProtagonistA could fly forever . ProtagonistA laughed and somersaulted in the air , enjoying the sensation of the wind rushing through ProtagonistA's fur . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a loud boom and felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's side . ProtagonistA looked down and saw an arrow protruding from ProtagonistA's body . ProtagonistA tried to fly away , but ProtagonistA's wings would no longer move . ProtagonistA plummeted to the ground , the arrow still embedded in ProtagonistA's side . As ProtagonistA lay there , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB approached ProtagonistA , a satisfied smirk on ProtagonistB's face .  Just another trophy for ProtagonistB's collection ,  ProtagonistB said coldly as ProtagonistB pulled out ProtagonistB's knife to skin ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt the life draining out of ProtagonistA's body as ProtagonistA lay there , helpless . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could have flown away and escaped ProtagonistA's fate , but it was too late . The last thing ProtagonistA saw was ProtagonistB's knife coming towards ProtagonistA , before everything went black . 
ProtagonistA was out for a ride on ProtagonistA's horse , enjoying the sunny day . ProtagonistA stopped to rest for a bit , and watched the sunset . It was beautiful , and ProtagonistA felt so lucky to be able to experience it . ProtagonistA sat there for a while , just taking it all in . 
ProtagonistA rode silently toward ProtagonistA's cabin , ProtagonistA's eyes half - closed and ProtagonistA's mind racing in its mind 's eye . ProtagonistA was thinking about the events of the past few days and how everything had changed so quickly . It seemed like only yesterday ProtagonistA had been living a normal life , going to work and spending time with ProtagonistA's friends . But now , ProtagonistA was on the run from the law , and ProtagonistA had no idea what the future held . ProtagonistA was tired , and ProtagonistA just wanted to rest , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving . ProtagonistA had to find a way to clear ProtagonistA's name and find out who was really behind all of this . As ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistA's cabin , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing in the shadows . ProtagonistA tensed up , but ProtagonistA did n't make a sound . ProtagonistB stepped out into the light , and ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB was a woman . ProtagonistB was holding a gun , and ProtagonistB looked very tired .  ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB 've been looking for ProtagonistA .  
ProtagonistA sat and watched the rain , knowing ProtagonistA's friends would be there to help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had been through so much lately and ProtagonistA was exhausted . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't keep going on like this , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to ask for help . The rain was a welcome respite from ProtagonistA's thoughts . ProtagonistA sat there for a long time , just watching the rain . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a dreamer . ProtagonistA was always off on some new adventure , never content to stay in one place for very long . So when ProtagonistA came to ProtagonistB one day and told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had found a new place for them to live , ProtagonistB was n't really surprised . What did surprise ProtagonistB , however , was the place ProtagonistA had found . Alice , my dear , we 're going to live in a storybook !  ProtagonistA exclaimed . ProtagonistB was sure ProtagonistA must be joking , but it was soon clear that ProtagonistA was serious . ProtagonistA had found an old house in the woods that was said to be the home of ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB was scared at first , but ProtagonistA assured ProtagonistB that there was nothing to be afraid of . After all , it 's just a story ,  ProtagonistA said .  And we 'll be the heroes of our own story . So ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA moved into the old house in the woods and began their adventure . They soon found out that the stories about ProtagonistC were true , but they also found out that ProtagonistC was n't really a bad person . In fact , ProtagonistC was quite lonely and was happy to have some company . ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA became good friends with ProtagonistC and would often sit by the fire and listen to ProtagonistC's stories . It was a magical time for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB knew that this was a story ProtagonistB would always remember . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's rock and stared into the water . ProtagonistA could see the fish swimming around and the plants moving in the current . It was so peaceful . ProtagonistA sat there for hours , just watching the water . 
ProtagonistA was about to take ProtagonistA's maidenhead to court . ProtagonistA was a bit nervous , but ProtagonistA was also excited . ProtagonistA had always wanted to experience what it was like to be with a man , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to get ProtagonistA's chance . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would enjoy it immensely . 
There was once ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a very curious girl . ProtagonistA loved to explore and learn new things . One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole . ProtagonistA followed the rabbit down the hole and found ProtagonistA in a strange place . ProtagonistA met many interesting creatures there and had many adventures . 
ProtagonistA sat on the bank , hunting for ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA had seen them go into the woods , but ProtagonistA could n't find them anywhere . ProtagonistA was about to give up and go home when ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes . ProtagonistA got up and followed the noise . It led ProtagonistA to a clearing where ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's friends , fast asleep . 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day . First , ProtagonistA got a bad grade on ProtagonistA's math test . Then , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB was moving away . To top it all off , ProtagonistA found out ProtagonistC had been hit by a car . ProtagonistA was so upset , ProtagonistA threw down ProtagonistA's chair and leaned forward in the air . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA's whole world was falling apart . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice . It was ProtagonistC , asking ProtagonistA to help ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistC was n't really gone . ProtagonistC was just hurt and needed ProtagonistA's help . ProtagonistA snapped into action and took ProtagonistC to the vet . ProtagonistC was going to be okay . ProtagonistA felt relieved . Even though ProtagonistA's day had started out terrible , it had ended on a good note . ProtagonistA was reminded that ProtagonistA always had the power to help others , even when it felt like ProtagonistA's own world was falling apart . 
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA saw the moon shining between the trees . ProtagonistA thought it was beautiful and decided to take a picture . When ProtagonistA looked at the picture later , ProtagonistA was surprised to see that the moon was not in the photo . ProtagonistA looked back up at the sky and saw that the moon had disappeared . 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible time remembering what ProtagonistA had done that morning . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had gotten out of bed and eaten breakfast , but after that , ProtagonistA's mind was a total blank . ProtagonistA racked ProtagonistA's brain , trying to think of anything that could help ProtagonistA remember , but it was all for naught . Finally , ProtagonistA gave up and decided to ask ProtagonistB , if ProtagonistB could help . Oh , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA ,  do ProtagonistB remember what ProtagonistA did this ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA and shook ProtagonistB's head . I'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB ca n't help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was n't with ProtagonistA this morning . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA suddenly remembered something . Oh , that 's right ! ProtagonistA went to the store this morning .  Relief washed over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA finally remembered what ProtagonistA had done . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's help and went on with ProtagonistA's day . 
ProtagonistA was a fox - woman of the valley , and in those days the fox - men of the valley fought evil as well as good . Even in the darkest hours of the war , when the survival of ProtagonistA's race depended on ProtagonistA keeping a close watch on ProtagonistA's allies and ProtagonistA's sons , ProtagonistA never wavered . ProtagonistA was a fierce fighter and a loyal friend , and ProtagonistA would do whatever it took to protect ProtagonistA's people . One day , during a particularly brutal battle , ProtagonistA was gravely injured . ProtagonistA was bleeding heavily and ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistA's life slipping away . As ProtagonistA lay there on the battlefield , ProtagonistA saw a beautiful light shining down on ProtagonistA . It was the light of the Fox God , and it filled ProtagonistA with strength and courage . ProtagonistA rose to ProtagonistA's feet and fought with renewed vigor . ProtagonistA was like a force of nature , and ProtagonistA quickly turned the tide of the battle . ProtagonistA's people were victorious , and they owed their lives to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a hero , and ProtagonistA would always be remembered as such . 
ProtagonistA was conceived in the winter of my year , seventeen months after ProtagonistB was twenty - four years old . ProtagonistA was born in the great Kingdom of Equestria , which was in a tier - one position at the time . However , ProtagonistA quickly rose in the ranks , due to ProtagonistA's great magical abilities . ProtagonistA became a key figure in the kingdom , stabilizing it and making it far more prosperous . ProtagonistA was loved by all , especially ProtagonistA's two closest friends , Malachite of the Crystal Metals and ProtagonistB . The three of them were inseparable , and they always had each other 's backs , no matter what . One day , when they were out on a quest together , they ran into a group of bandits . The bandits were heavily armed and outnumbered them three to one . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends were fighting as best they could , but they were quickly being overwhelmed . Just when it looked like they were about to be defeated , ProtagonistA summoned a powerful magical blast that took out all of the bandits . ProtagonistA's friends were amazed at ProtagonistA's power , and they knew that ProtagonistA was destined for great things . ProtagonistA continued to use ProtagonistA's magic to help ProtagonistA's kingdom , and ProtagonistA soon became one of the most powerful and respected leaders in all of Equestria . ProtagonistA was loved by all , and ProtagonistA lived a long and happy life with ProtagonistA's two best friends by ProtagonistA's side . 
ProtagonistA is sitting with ProtagonistA's wings folded , legs crossed at the navel . ProtagonistA is thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how it has led ProtagonistA to this moment . ProtagonistA is at peace with ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's choices . ProtagonistA has no regrets . ProtagonistA looks up at the sky and sees the beauty of the world around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA is content . 
ProtagonistA had been searching through the hospital wing for hours , looking for the right book . ProtagonistA was exhausted , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to find it . The sun was just beginning to set when ProtagonistA finally found what ProtagonistA was looking for . ProtagonistA quickly made ProtagonistA's way to the small circular room that was ProtagonistA's office and began the day with an appointment . 
ProtagonistA stood at the edge of the cliff , ProtagonistA's head down and eyes wide , looking out into the ocean beyond . ProtagonistA had always loved the ocean , but this was the first time ProtagonistA had ever been so close to it . The sound of the waves crashing against the rocks was soothing , and the smell of salt was invigorating . ProtagonistA was about to take a step forward when ProtagonistA heard a voice behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA , don't!She turned to see ProtagonistA's mother running towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had always been warned about the dangers of the cliff , but ProtagonistA had never thought ProtagonistA would actually be in any danger . What are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistA's mother asked , out of breath . ProtagonistA just wanted to see the ocean ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA did n't mean to scare you . You did n't scare me ,  ProtagonistA's mother said .  I was just worried about ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA realized then how foolish ProtagonistA had been . ProtagonistA was lucky ProtagonistA's mother had been there to stop ProtagonistA . Let 's go back to the car ,  ProtagonistA's mother said .  I think we 've seen enough of the ocean for one day . ProtagonistA nodded and followed ProtagonistA's mother back to the car . ProtagonistA was quiet the whole way home , and ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistA ProtagonistA would never do anything so reckless again . 
I had never heard of ProtagonistA until ProtagonistA was gone , but ProtagonistA was exactly what I was . We were both creative souls who loved to express ourselves through art . We both loved to laugh and have fun , and we were both always up for a good time . ProtagonistA was the first person I ever met who truly understood me , and I will never forget ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA leaned ProtagonistA's head back against the window and peered into the sea below . ProtagonistA could see the fish swimming in the water and the coral reefs . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could go swimming in the sea , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't . ProtagonistA was on a ship , and it was taking ProtagonistA to a new place . ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA was excited to find out . 
ProtagonistA turned at the last minute to see ProtagonistB sitting on the bank watching ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA waved , but ProtagonistB just sat there . ProtagonistA turned back to the river and continued to paddle ProtagonistA's canoe . ProtagonistA had been paddling for hours and was getting tired . ProtagonistA looked back at ProtagonistB again , but this time ProtagonistB was gone . ProtagonistB must have gone home . ProtagonistA sighed and paddled on . 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the shade of a tree , looking up from the book lying on ProtagonistA's lap . ProtagonistA saw a rabbit running by and followed it with ProtagonistA's eyes . Suddenly , the rabbit disappeared and ProtagonistA saw a door in the tree . ProtagonistA got up and walked over to the door , wondering if ProtagonistA should go in . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's saddled legs and stared down at ProtagonistA's hooves , wondering what the terror of the demon spell cast down on the citizens should have been like . It had been a long time since ProtagonistA had been able to use ProtagonistA's magic , and ProtagonistA was itching to try it out again . ProtagonistA had been practicing in secret , but ProtagonistA was still not sure if ProtagonistA was ready to face the demon again . ProtagonistA had to find a way to break the spell and save the people from the demon 's wrath . 
ProtagonistA's parents must have been sleeping soundly , because ProtagonistA had a passion for all things water - related , from swimming to pot - dancing . ProtagonistA loved the feel of the water on ProtagonistA's skin , the way it made ProtagonistA feel weightless and free . One night , ProtagonistA snuck out of ProtagonistA's bedroom window and made ProtagonistA's way to the pool . ProtagonistA dove in , and the cool water was a shock to ProtagonistA's system . ProtagonistA swam laps for hours , until ProtagonistA's skin was pruned and ProtagonistA's muscles ached . When ProtagonistA finally got out , ProtagonistA felt invigorated and alive . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never be able to go back to sleep , so ProtagonistA went to the kitchen and made a pot of coffee . ProtagonistA sat at the kitchen table and watched the sun come up , feeling grateful for the gift of water . 
ProtagonistA leaned against the tree , ProtagonistA's eyes closed and ProtagonistA's mouth hanging open . ProtagonistA was tired from walking all day and just wanted to rest for a bit . ProtagonistA did n't hear the rustling in the bushes behind ProtagonistA until it was too late . ProtagonistA felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA back and then everything went black . 
ProtagonistA stared up at the world , raising ProtagonistA's hoof to ProtagonistA's face . It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining down on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt so lucky to be alive . ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA could ever want , and ProtagonistA was surrounded by ProtagonistA's friends and family . What more could ProtagonistA ask for ? 
ProtagonistA stood there , still wearing ProtagonistA's royal blue dress . ProtagonistA felt like a fool , like ProtagonistA had been played for a fool . ProtagonistA had been so sure that ProtagonistB had loved ProtagonistA , that ProtagonistB had wanted to marry ProtagonistA . But it turned out ProtagonistB had only wanted one thing from ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had given it to ProtagonistB so easily . ProtagonistA had been so naïve . ProtagonistA felt the tears welling up in ProtagonistA's eyes , but ProtagonistA refused to give ProtagonistB the satisfaction of seeing ProtagonistA's cry . ProtagonistA turned and walked away from ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA's head held high . ProtagonistA would never let anyone take advantage of ProtagonistA like that again . 
ProtagonistA wandered the quiet , wet wasteland of the forest , ProtagonistA's eyes scanning the thicket just outside the thicket . ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had seen the creature in the distance . ProtagonistA was getting closer now , ProtagonistA could see its eyes shining in the darkness , and ProtagonistA knew it was watching ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was getting closer now , ProtagonistA could see its eyes shining in the darkness , and ProtagonistA knew it was watching ProtagonistA .

ProtagonistA was getting closer now , ProtagonistA could see its eyes shining in the darkness , and ProtagonistA knew it was watching ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was the only member of ProtagonistA's family who had not been disemboweled . ProtagonistA was the black sheep , the outcast . No one knew why ProtagonistA had been spared , but ProtagonistA was grateful . ProtagonistA did n't want to end up like ProtagonistA's brothers and sisters , their entrails spilling out onto the cold , hard ground . ProtagonistA lived a solitary life , but ProtagonistA was content . ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's books and ProtagonistA's cats and that was all ProtagonistA needed . ProtagonistA did n't need anyone else , not after what had happened . One day , ProtagonistA's peaceful life was shattered . ProtagonistA heard a loud crash and then screams . ProtagonistA's heart pounding , ProtagonistA ran to see what was happening . To ProtagonistA's horror , ProtagonistA saw a group of men with knives , slaughtering ProtagonistA's family . ProtagonistA tried to run , but they caught ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA fought and fought , but it was no use . They took ProtagonistA to the same spot where ProtagonistA's brothers and sisters had been killed and then they disemboweled ProtagonistA . As ProtagonistA lay there dying , ProtagonistA could only think one thing : why was ProtagonistA the only one who had been spared ? 
ProtagonistA was sitting on ProtagonistA's own , with a book in one hand and a pile of feathers in the other . ProtagonistA was lost in thought , wondering what to do with the feathers . ProtagonistA had found them earlier in the day , when ProtagonistA was out walking in the woods . At first , ProtagonistA had thought they were beautiful and had wanted to take them home . But now ProtagonistA was n't so sure . Maybe it would be better to leave them where they were . After all , they probably belonged to some bird . But then again , maybe the bird was dead and the feathers were all that was left . ProtagonistA could n't decide what to do and so ProtagonistA just sat there , with the book in one hand and the feathers in the other . 
 ProtagonistB ?  said ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's hoof hovering over the apple cart .  Are ProtagonistB sure ProtagonistB want to do this?I'm positive ,  said ProtagonistB .  After all , we 've been planning this for months . But what if something goes wrong?Nothing will go wrong ,  said ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB have everything under control . ProtagonistA sighed and shook ProtagonistA's head .  ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistB 're right ,  ProtagonistA said .  Because ProtagonistA really do n't want to end up like poor old Mrs. Haggerty . Don't worry , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB wo n't let anything happen to ProtagonistA . With that , ProtagonistA took a deep breath and stepped into the cart . ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a reassuring smile and began to push the cart down the hill . At first , everything went according to plan . The cart picked up speed and ProtagonistA began to scream , but ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA was enjoying the ride . The wind was whipping through ProtagonistA's hair and ProtagonistA felt alive . However , as they neared the bottom of the hill , ProtagonistA saw something that made ProtagonistA's heart stop . There was a large rock in the middle of the path and the cart was heading straight for it . ProtagonistB , look out !  ProtagonistA shouted . But it was too late . The cart slammed into the rock and overturned , sending ProtagonistA flying through the air . ProtagonistA hit the ground with a thud and lay there , motionless . ProtagonistA ! Speak to ProtagonistB !  said ProtagonistB , frantic . But ProtagonistA did n't respond . ProtagonistA was unconscious , and ProtagonistA had no idea what was going to happen to ProtagonistA next . 
ProtagonistA sat down on the bench opposite ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistA and smiled .  Hello ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA's name is Sarah .   Hello , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA replied .  It 's nice to meet ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA talked for a while about their lives and their families . They laughed and shared stories . It was a beautiful day , and the two women enjoyed each other 's company . 
Alice and ProtagonistA were just finishing up loading ProtagonistA's car when they noticed their neighbors peering through their windows with panicked looks on their faces . Alice and James exchanged confused glances before quickly finishing up and getting into the car . ProtagonistA started the car and began to drive away when they saw the first of the hearers - ProtagonistB running down the street with ProtagonistB's hair flying behind ProtagonistB in the wind . ProtagonistB was followed by a man , and then another , and another , until it seemed like the whole neighborhood was filled with people running and screaming . ProtagonistA quickly turned the car around and drove back to their house . Alice and ProtagonistA ran inside and locked all the doors and windows , huddling together in the living room as they listened to the chaos outside . It was a chilly , dark , and stormy morning , and Alice and James were surrounded by the hysterical hearers . 
ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way back to ProtagonistA's office when ProtagonistA saw the great city of Ponyville once again . ProtagonistA had been away on business for a few weeks and was glad to be home . As ProtagonistA walked through the streets , ProtagonistA saw that everything was just as ProtagonistA had left it . ProtagonistA smiled and waved to the ponies ProtagonistA knew and soon ProtagonistA was back at ProtagonistA's office . ProtagonistA sat down at ProtagonistA's desk and got to work , feeling happy to be home . 
ProtagonistA has been seen seated on the floor , ProtagonistA's heels creaking slightly , the air of a confined space , and ProtagonistA sits quietly , a slight air of nervousness attached to ProtagonistA , as if ProtagonistA were about to lose ProtagonistA's temper . ProtagonistA has been this way for hours , ever since ProtagonistA was first placed in the room . It was small , with no windows and only one door . The door was locked , and ProtagonistA had the key . ProtagonistA was given food and water , but no one came to check on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was starting to go stir - crazy . Finally , ProtagonistA heard the door unlock and ProtagonistB entered the room . ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB looked around the room before settling ProtagonistB's gaze on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm here to help ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said . ProtagonistA just stared at ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA could trust ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB know this must be hard for ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB continued .  But ProtagonistB promise , ProtagonistB 'm here to help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA still did n't say anything . ProtagonistA did n't know what to say . I'm going to get ProtagonistA out of here , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  But ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA's help . ProtagonistA finally found ProtagonistA's voice .  What do ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA to do ?  ProtagonistA asked . ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA to trust ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB replied . ProtagonistA thought for a moment before ProtagonistA finally nodded ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA did n't know what else to do . ProtagonistA had to trust ProtagonistB if ProtagonistA wanted to get out of there . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA what ProtagonistB needed ProtagonistA to do and ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB's instructions . ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA did n't want to stay in that room any longer . ProtagonistA did everything ProtagonistB asked and finally , ProtagonistA was free . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA was brave and ProtagonistA smiled . ProtagonistA was finally free . 
ProtagonistA leaned against the tree , ProtagonistA's hooves tugging at the bark of the tree , not sure if ProtagonistA liked it . ProtagonistA looked around at the other trees and noticed that they all had bark on them too . ProtagonistA wondered if ProtagonistA was the only one who did n't like it . ProtagonistA decided to ask one of the other horses . Hey , do you like the bark on the trees ?  ProtagonistA asked . No , I do n't really like it ,  the other horse replied . Me neither ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA wonder why we have to have it . I do n't know ,  the other horse said .  But it 's not really that bad . ProtagonistA thought about it for a moment and then decided that the other horse was right . It was n't that bad . In fact , it was kind of nice . ProtagonistA leaned against the tree and closed ProtagonistA's eyes , enjoying the feel of the bark against ProtagonistA's skin . 
ProtagonistA leaned against the tree , ProtagonistA's gaze scanning the atmosphere . It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was surrounded by ProtagonistA's friends . But something was off . ProtagonistA could n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on it . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes . ProtagonistA's friends froze , and they all turned to look at the source of the noise . Out from the undergrowth came a large , furry creature . It was a bear!The bear stood up on its hind legs and let out a mighty roar . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends were terrified . They had never seen a bear this close before . The bear began to walk towards them , and they all backed away in fear . But ProtagonistA stood ProtagonistA's ground . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do something . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and stepped forward . ProtagonistA held out ProtagonistA's hand and said ,  It 's okay , bear . We 're not going to hurt you . Amazingly , the bear stopped and sniffed ProtagonistA's hand . Then it did something even more amazing . It sat down and let ProtagonistA pet it!After a few minutes , the bear got up and wandered off into the woods . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends were safe . But they would never forget their close encounter with a real live bear ! 
ProtagonistA stood there , ProtagonistA's hooves resting on the ground . ProtagonistA was a beautiful horse , with a long mane and tail . ProtagonistA had been ridden by many people , but ProtagonistA's favorite was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB would come to the farm every day and brush ProtagonistA's mane and give ProtagonistA a carrot . One day , ProtagonistB did n't come to the farm . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB . The next day , ProtagonistB came to the farm , but ProtagonistB was different . ProtagonistB was sad and ProtagonistB's eyes were red . ProtagonistB did n't say anything , ProtagonistB just hugged ProtagonistA's neck and cried . ProtagonistA knew that something was wrong , but ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA just stood there and let ProtagonistB cry . 
ProtagonistA sat down on the side of the tree , ProtagonistA's leg dangling past the tip . ProtagonistA looked out at the vast forest before ProtagonistA and sighed . It was so peaceful here , so different from the hustle and bustle of the city . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and allowed ProtagonistA to drift off , the sound of the leaves rustling in the breeze lulling ProtagonistA to sleep . 
ProtagonistA was in a great mood today . ProtagonistA was whistling as ProtagonistA went about ProtagonistA's work , and ProtagonistA could n't stop smiling . It was a beautiful day outside , and ProtagonistA was surrounded by the people ProtagonistA loved most . Life was good . But then , ProtagonistB Sparkle came into the room and ruined everything . What 's wrong , ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked , still smiling despite the sudden change in atmosphere . I'm out of cupcakes ,  ProtagonistB said , looking miserable .  And ProtagonistB really wanted one . Oh , ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's smile fading . ProtagonistA knew how much ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistB's cupcakes .  ProtagonistA can make ProtagonistB another one . It 's not the same ,  ProtagonistB said , pouting .  ProtagonistB wanted that one . ProtagonistA tried to console ProtagonistB , but it was no use . ProtagonistB was out of cupcakes , and ProtagonistB was not happy about it . 
ProtagonistA had been in the dark for what felt like hours . ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was or how ProtagonistA got there . The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was putting on a dress with a watch attached to it . ProtagonistA could hear the watch ticking away in the darkness and it was starting to give ProtagonistA a headache . ProtagonistA tried to move ProtagonistA's arms and legs but they were stuck . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice .  ProtagonistA , wake up .  The voice was soft and gentle . ProtagonistA tried to open ProtagonistA's eyes but ProtagonistA could n't .  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA need to wake up .  The voice said again . This time ProtagonistA was able to open ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA was back in ProtagonistA's bedroom . The dress and watch were gone . ProtagonistA must have been dreaming . 
ProtagonistA was at the dinner party , waiting for ProtagonistB , to apologize for not coming sooner . ProtagonistA was getting impatient , as the minutes ticked by and ProtagonistB still had n't shown up . Finally , ProtagonistA decided to go looking for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA searched the castle from top to bottom , but there was no sign of ProtagonistB anywhere . ProtagonistA was just about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the dungeon . ProtagonistA cautiously made ProtagonistA's way down , and sure enough , there was ProtagonistB , locked in a ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA had no idea what ProtagonistB had done to deserve this treatment . But ProtagonistA was determined to get ProtagonistB out . ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistC and demanded the key to the cell . After a bit of convincing , ProtagonistC finally handed it over . ProtagonistA rushed to ProtagonistB's side and embraced ProtagonistB . They were both relieved to be reunited . But there was still the matter of why ProtagonistB had been imprisoned . That would have to wait for another day . For now , they were just happy to be together again . 
ProtagonistA blinked at the moon and saw the glitter of the friends ' tears around ProtagonistA . They had all been through so much together , and now they were finally free . But even in their freedom , they were still bound by the memories of what they had endured . They would never be able to forget , but at least they could be together and support each other through it . 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friend were standing on the edge of a stream . The sun was setting and the water was sparkling . ProtagonistA's friend said ,  This is the most beautiful thing I 've ever seen .  ProtagonistA agreed . They stood there for a long time , just admiring the view . 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the seat of a beach cruiser , ProtagonistA's tail wagging . ProtagonistA loved going for rides in the cruiser , especially when it meant going to the beach . ProtagonistA's favorite part was sticking ProtagonistA's head out the window and feeling the wind in ProtagonistA's fur . 
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes . ProtagonistA was beginning to get quite worn out , though ProtagonistA had n't intended for ProtagonistA's obsession to get out of control . It had all started innocently enough . ProtagonistA had just wanted to try one of those new cupcake places that had opened up down the street . But then ProtagonistA had gotten a taste of the creamy frosting and ProtagonistA was hooked . Before ProtagonistA knew it , ProtagonistA was making daily trips to the cupcake shop , and then ProtagonistA started buying them in bulk . ProtagonistA even started making ProtagonistA's own cupcakes at home . But now , ProtagonistA had run out of both money and cupcakes . ProtagonistA was desperate . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's friends and family were getting worried about ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA just could n't help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA needed those cupcakes . So , ProtagonistA hatched a plan . ProtagonistA would break into the cupcake shop in the middle of the night and steal some cupcakes . It was the perfect plan . But when ProtagonistA got to the shop , ProtagonistA found that the door was locked . ProtagonistA was about to give up and go home when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the back of the shop . ProtagonistA cautiously made ProtagonistA's way towards the sound and found a door that was slightly ajar . ProtagonistA peeked inside and saw ProtagonistB , putting away some cupcakes . ProtagonistA quickly ducked back out of sight and waited for ProtagonistB to leave . Once ProtagonistB was gone , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way into the shop and grabbed a few cupcakes . ProtagonistA was about to leave when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB coming back . ProtagonistA hid under the counter , praying that ProtagonistB would n't find ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistB did . ProtagonistB reached under the counter and grabbed ProtagonistA by the arm .  ProtagonistB knew someone was stealing ProtagonistB's cupcakes !  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA 're coming with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was dragged out of the shop and into the back room . ProtagonistB tied ProtagonistA to a chair and began to interrogate ProtagonistA .  Why are ProtagonistA stealing ProtagonistB's cupcakes ?  ProtagonistB asked . ProtagonistA tried to think of a good lie , but ProtagonistA was so tired and stressed from ProtagonistA's addiction that ProtagonistA could n't come up with anything . So , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB the truth .  ProtagonistA 'm addicted to ProtagonistB's cupcakes ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA just ca n't help ProtagonistA . Mr . Cake looked at ProtagonistA sympathetically .  ProtagonistB understand ,  ProtagonistB said .  But ProtagonistA ca n't just steal from ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB 'm going to have to call the police . ProtagonistA was taken to the police station and charged with theft . ProtagonistA was given a stern warning and told to stay away from the cupcake shop . But ProtagonistA just could n't help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was addicted to those cupcakes . And ProtagonistA would do anything to get ProtagonistA's fix . 
ProtagonistA sat down on the edge of the bank , crossed ProtagonistA's legs , and stared out at the sea beyond the bank . ProtagonistA had always loved the ocean , but today it looked different . The water was a deep blue , almost black , and the waves were high and foamy . ProtagonistA felt a sudden urge to jump into the water and swim out to the horizon . 
ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes . ProtagonistA was a bit tired , having made it three hours from here and had no idea how much longer that would last . ProtagonistA was walking in the forest , looking for a place to rest , when ProtagonistA came across a small cottage . ProtagonistA knocked on the door , and a kind - looking old woman answered . The old woman invited ProtagonistA in , and offered ProtagonistA a cupcake . ProtagonistA was so tired , ProtagonistA decided to stay the night . The old woman showed ProtagonistA to a room , and ProtagonistA fell asleep as soon as ProtagonistA's head hit the pillow . The next morning , ProtagonistA woke up and went downstairs . The old woman was nowhere to be found , but there was a freshly baked batch of cupcakes on the table . ProtagonistA ate one , and then set off on ProtagonistA's journey , feeling refreshed and energized . 
ProtagonistA had been looking forward to this train ride for months . ProtagonistA was finally going to meet ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been born six months earlier , and ProtagonistA's mother had died shortly after giving birth . ProtagonistB had been away on business when ProtagonistA was born , and by the time ProtagonistB got back , ProtagonistA's mother had passed away . ProtagonistA had been raised by ProtagonistA's grandparents since then , and they had told ProtagonistA all about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was excited to finally meet ProtagonistB and see what ProtagonistB was like . As ProtagonistA boarded the train , ProtagonistA looked around for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA expected to see an elderly , dainty man sitting beside ProtagonistA . Instead , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC sitting in the seat next to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistC was handsome , and ProtagonistC looked a lot like ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was confused . ProtagonistA did n't know what to say . ProtagonistC introduced ProtagonistC as ProtagonistA's father . ProtagonistC explained that ProtagonistC had been away on business when ProtagonistA was born and that ProtagonistC had only recently found out about ProtagonistA . ProtagonistC said that ProtagonistC had been looking for ProtagonistA for months . ProtagonistA was thrilled to finally meet ProtagonistB . They talked and laughed all the way to the Smithers . When they arrived , ProtagonistB invited ProtagonistA to come and live with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was excited to start ProtagonistA's new life with ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA , dressed in the highest style , sat down in the low dining- room of ProtagonistA's house on the bank of the Thames . ProtagonistA had just returned from a successful season in London and was eager to relax in ProtagonistA's own home . The view from the dining room was beautiful , and ProtagonistA felt at peace . ProtagonistA was content to sit and enjoy the tranquility of the moment . 
ProtagonistA sat down on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked down at the blank gray blue horizon . ProtagonistA was bored , and there was nothing to do . ProtagonistA had been sitting in the same spot for hours , and the only thing that had changed was the position of the sun . ProtagonistA was about to get up and walk around when ProtagonistA saw something in the distance . It was a small black dot , and it was getting closer . As it got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was a bird . It was a crow , and it was flying straight towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA forgot to be scared . The crow landed on the ground in front of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA reached out to touch it . 
ProtagonistA was in the dark hall of the palace , in the stable where ProtagonistA was kept . ProtagonistA was talking about something ProtagonistA had done .  ProtagonistA ca n't believe ProtagonistA did that ,  ProtagonistA said .  It was so stupid .  ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and sighed .  ProtagonistA 'm never going to do anything like that again .  
ProtagonistB was always telling ProtagonistA to hurry up .  Come on , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB would say .  We do n't want to be late for ProtagonistA's piano lesson .  But ProtagonistA was never in a hurry . ProtagonistA liked to take ProtagonistA's time and smell the roses , as ProtagonistC always said .  There 's no hurry , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC would tell ProtagonistA .  Life is too short to rush through it .  But ProtagonistB was always in a hurry . ProtagonistB was always rushing around , trying to get things done .  Come on , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB would say .  Let 's go .  And ProtagonistA would follow ProtagonistB , Hurrying to keep up . 
Carol Sparkle was out of cupcakes . Pinkie must have gone to the royal court . ProtagonistA was advancing towards the brides , wearing a pointed black frock , a black skirt even shorter than ProtagonistA's hips , and heels that reached just below ProtagonistA's knees . They wore flowing white dresses , or rather , they wore dresses like they were made of paper . All those years of stick - figure cartoon ponies that had been created by the Evil Weasels had all been wiped out , and now there was nothing but the images of ponies hoofing around a campfire . None of them , that is , when ProtagonistA had the chance to show them . 
It 's all right , Sweetie Belle , said Alice , because it was always good to know what ProtagonistA was thinking or doing , and if ProtagonistA was right , ProtagonistA was always wiser than ProtagonistA was . But now that they were both adults , it was harder to keep track of ProtagonistA's thoughts , and harder still to offer sage advice . 
ProtagonistA was perched on the edge of a high bank , snapping the last few pennies from ProtagonistA's neck when ProtagonistA heard the call of an emergency . ProtagonistA quickly scrambled down the bank and ran towards the sound . ProtagonistA could see a crowd of people gathered around something in the middle of the street . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA pushed ProtagonistA's way through the crowd and knelt down next to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was still breathing , but ProtagonistB was unconscious . ProtagonistA took off ProtagonistA's scarf and tied it tightly around ProtagonistB's arm to stop the bleeding . Then ProtagonistA turned to the crowd and shouted for someone to call an ambulance . 
ProtagonistA had taken to riding into ProtagonistA's house on ProtagonistA's pink saddle hoof , noting the rows of fifth - story windows that led from ProtagonistA's backyard down into the city . It was a short ride , but it made ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA would trot down the street , ProtagonistA's pink saddle and hooves shining in the sun , and people would stop and stare . Some would even applaud . ProtagonistA loved the attention , but ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistC even more . ProtagonistC was the one who had brought ProtagonistA this far in life , and ProtagonistA was grateful for every moment they spent together . 
There was ProtagonistA . They had been together for two years and were very happy . One day , ProtagonistB proposed to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA said yes . They were both very excited and began planning their wedding . Everything was going great until ProtagonistC found out about the engagement . ProtagonistC was not happy about it and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could not marry ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was heartbroken and did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistC and did n't want to disobey ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistA also loved ProtagonistB . After much thought , ProtagonistA decided to elope with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew it would make ProtagonistC angry , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA was going to marry ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA was lying on ProtagonistA back in the grass , looking up at the stars . ProtagonistA felt someone tilt ProtagonistA back , and ProtagonistA looked up to see ProtagonistB standing over ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was holding a telescope , and ProtagonistB offered it to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA took it and looked through it , gasping at the sight of the stars up close . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about the constellations and the stories behind them . ProtagonistA was entranced . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and lay back down , staring up at the stars again . ProtagonistA felt at peace , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget this night . 
ProtagonistA was sketching a town in the snow when ProtagonistA turned to see the stars shining brightly in the evening sky . ProtagonistA was so captivated by their beauty that ProtagonistA forgot to finish ProtagonistA's sketch . Instead , ProtagonistA lay down in the snow and watched the stars until ProtagonistA fell asleep . 
ProtagonistA sighed as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistA's friends ride into the forest . ProtagonistA had always been the more adventurous one , but since ProtagonistA's horse had been injured , ProtagonistA had been stuck at the farm . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's friends would have a great time , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little jealous . ProtagonistA decided to go for a walk to take ProtagonistA's mind off of things . As ProtagonistA was walking , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the bushes . ProtagonistA was about to run away when ProtagonistA saw a horse step out . It was the most beautiful horse ProtagonistA had ever seen . ProtagonistA approached it cautiously and it nuzzled ProtagonistA's hand . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to take it back to the farm . ProtagonistA mounted the horse and rode off . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's friends would be so jealous when they saw ProtagonistA riding the horse . 
ProtagonistA stepped carefully down the steps of ProtagonistA's trailer , ProtagonistA's eyes resting on the blackened metal . It was all ProtagonistA could do to keep from crying . ProtagonistA 'd lived in this trailer for nearly two years , and it was the only home ProtagonistA 'd ever known . But now , it was gone . burned to the ground in a matter of hours . ProtagonistA had barely made it out alive . ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do now . ProtagonistA had no home , no belongings , no money . ProtagonistA was completely alone in the world . But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep going . ProtagonistA had to find a way to start over . 
ProtagonistA stood in the dim light of the distance , ProtagonistA face downcast and blue eyes fixed on the ground below . ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had received the news . It seemed like ProtagonistA's feet had a mind of their own , carrying ProtagonistA away from ProtagonistA's old life and into this new one . ProtagonistA did n't know what to expect , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep going . The sun was setting now , and ProtagonistA could see a faint light in the distance . ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was a lamp . And then ProtagonistA saw the house . It was small and rundown , but it was home . ProtagonistA walked up to the door and knocked . ProtagonistA heard footsteps inside , and then the door opened . ProtagonistB stood there , ProtagonistB's face lined with years of worry and hardship . But when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB's eyes lit up with hope . ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA were never coming back . ProtagonistA smiled and stepped inside .  ProtagonistA 'm home ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm finally home .  
ProtagonistA , took a moment to admire the view . The sun was setting behind the mountains , and the sky was a beautiful shades of orange and red . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was on top of the world . ProtagonistA was about to head back inside when ProtagonistA saw something out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye . It was a rainbow ! ProtagonistA had never seen one in real life before . ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA started to run towards it . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that the rainbow was actually a bridge . And on the other side of the bridge was a castle ! ProtagonistA had never seen anything so beautiful in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was about to cross the bridge when ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name . It was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB must have followed ProtagonistA . Rainbow Dash , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked . I'm going to cross this bridge and explore that castle ,  ProtagonistA replied . But ProtagonistA do n't even know what 's on the other side ,  ProtagonistB said . That 's why ProtagonistA 'm going to find out ,  ProtagonistA said . And with that , ProtagonistA started to cross the bridge . 
ProtagonistA leaned against the tree , ProtagonistA's hooves strumming happily . ProtagonistA was content to just sit there and enjoy the day . The sun was shining and the birds were singing . It was a perfect day . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance . It sounded like someone was in trouble . Without hesitating , ProtagonistA ran towards the noise . ProtagonistA found a group of rabbits being chased by a fox . Without thinking , ProtagonistA leapt into action and chased the fox away . The rabbits were safe . ProtagonistA had saved the day . 
ProtagonistA stood before ProtagonistA's desk , wondering what ProtagonistA should do next . ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's project for hours , and ProtagonistA was starting to get tired . Maybe ProtagonistA should take a break and come back to it later . But ProtagonistA did n't want to lose ProtagonistA's momentum . ProtagonistA decided to keep working and see how much ProtagonistA could get done . 
ProtagonistA was wiping the sweat away from ProtagonistA's forehead when ProtagonistA saw the light . It was a hot day , and ProtagonistA had been working in the garden for hours . ProtagonistA was about to go inside when ProtagonistA saw the light . It was a strange light , and it was coming from the other side of the garden . ProtagonistA was curious , so ProtagonistA decided to investigate . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that the light was coming from a hole in the ground . ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it before . ProtagonistA was about to call out for help when ProtagonistA heard a voice . ProtagonistA , come down here . The voice was strange , and it sounded like it was coming from the hole . ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA was also curious . ProtagonistA decided to go down the hole . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that the voice was coming from a creature . It was a small creature , and it was very strange looking . It had big eyes , and it was wearing a strange hat . Who are you ?  ProtagonistA asked . I am the Cheshire Cat ,  the creature said .  And I have come to take ProtagonistA on an adventure . ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA was also excited . ProtagonistA had always wanted to go on an adventure , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to get ProtagonistA's chance . 
ProtagonistA blasted ProtagonistA's horn into the air and dropped down to the floor , hovering there , impossible . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a rebel , and this was ProtagonistA's latest stunt . ProtagonistA had figured out how to hover using ProtagonistA's horn , and now ProtagonistA was showing off to ProtagonistA's friends . They were all amazed , and a little bit scared . ProtagonistA laughed at their reactions and then floated up into the air again . ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life , until ProtagonistA suddenly lost control and started to fall . ProtagonistA panicked and tried to blast ProtagonistA's horn again , but it was too late . ProtagonistA hit the ground with a thud and was knocked unconscious . When ProtagonistA came to , ProtagonistA was surrounded by ProtagonistA's worried friends . They were all relieved that ProtagonistA was okay , but ProtagonistA was embarrassed . ProtagonistA swore ProtagonistA would never show off like that again . 
ProtagonistA was having a tough day . ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's job , ProtagonistA's cat had run away , and ProtagonistA's boyfriend had just broken up with ProtagonistA . As ProtagonistA walked through the door of ProtagonistA's apartment , ProtagonistA was not expecting anything good to happen . But then , ProtagonistA saw a pinkie tracing around ProtagonistA's head . At first , ProtagonistA thought it was a dragon , but then ProtagonistA realized it was a pegasus . ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA laughed out loud . It was just the thing ProtagonistA needed to brighten ProtagonistA's day . 
ProtagonistA leaned against the trees , ProtagonistA's head resting lightly on the large , fat trunk . ProtagonistA felt the rough bark against ProtagonistA's cheek and the cool air on ProtagonistA's skin . ProtagonistA breathed in the fresh , piney smell and closed ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA felt peaceful and calm here , surrounded by the tall trees and the chirping birds . It was ProtagonistA's happy place . ProtagonistA had come here often as a child , when ProtagonistA was sad or angry or just needed to get away from the world . It was ProtagonistA's refuge . ProtagonistA would climb to the top of the trees and sit on the branches , looking out at the world below . It felt like ProtagonistA could see everything from up there and nothing could touch ProtagonistA . Now , as an adult , ProtagonistA still came here when ProtagonistA needed to clear ProtagonistA's head . It was ProtagonistA's sanctuary . ProtagonistA would sit on the ground , leaning against the tree , and let the world around ProtagonistA fade away . For a little while , ProtagonistA could just be . And that was enough . 
ProtagonistA stroked the buttons of ProtagonistA's blouse , feeling the softness beneath ProtagonistA's skin . ProtagonistA loved the way the fabric felt against ProtagonistA's fingertips and the way the buttons clicked when ProtagonistA ran ProtagonistA's fingers over them . It was a simple blouse , but it made ProtagonistA feel beautiful . ProtagonistA twirled in front of the mirror , admiring the way the fabric flowed around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt like a princess in a fairy tale . 
ProtagonistB eyed ProtagonistA , but had no intention of touching ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always so perfect and put - together , and ProtagonistB was a bit of a mess . ProtagonistB did n't want to ruin ProtagonistA's perfect image with ProtagonistB's own messiness . But then ProtagonistA did something unexpected . ProtagonistA reached out and touched ProtagonistB's cheek , wiping away a stray tear .  It 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm here for ProtagonistB .  From that moment on , ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB could always count on ProtagonistA to be there for ProtagonistB , no matter what . 
ProtagonistA sat on the bank , ProtagonistA's hooves carefully below the surface of the water , ProtagonistA's flat chest and shy muzzle showing the attention of the natural beauty . ProtagonistA was a beautiful young mare , and the forest was ProtagonistA's home . ProtagonistA loved the peace and quiet of the woods , and the gentle trickle of the stream was like music to ProtagonistA's ears . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let out a soft sigh , enjoying the warm sun on ProtagonistA's skin . 
ProtagonistA sat on the ground , ProtagonistA's hooves resting in front of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a beautiful horse , with a long , flowing mane and a sleek , muscular body . ProtagonistA was the fastest horse in the world , and ProtagonistA knew it . ProtagonistA had won many races , and ProtagonistA was the only horse that had ever been able to beat the legendary Black Stallion . But now , ProtagonistA was retired . ProtagonistA was old , and ProtagonistA's racing days were behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was content to spend ProtagonistA's days grazing in the pasture , and ProtagonistA was happy to be surrounded by ProtagonistA's family - ProtagonistA's husband , ProtagonistA's foals , and ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA was happy , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit sad when ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's racing days . ProtagonistA missed the thrill of the race , the wind in ProtagonistA's mane , and the feeling of crossing the finish line first . But ProtagonistA was content , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had had a good life . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's saddle and watched the sun rise over the high hills . ProtagonistA had been riding all night , and ProtagonistA was tired . But ProtagonistA had to keep going . ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistA's way back home . The sun was getting higher in the sky , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to find shelter soon . ProtagonistA rode over a hill and saw a small cabin in the distance . ProtagonistA rode to the cabin and knocked on the door . A woman answered the door . ProtagonistA asked if ProtagonistA could stay there for a while . The woman said yes , and ProtagonistA went inside . 
ProtagonistA sat down on the golden throne in ProtagonistA's tower , and ProtagonistA looked out at the sea of stars that stretched before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was the Queen of the Night , and this was ProtagonistA's kingdom . ProtagonistA ruled over the stars and the darkness , and ProtagonistA was beautiful and powerful . ProtagonistA was also lonely . ProtagonistA had no one to share ProtagonistA's kingdom with , and ProtagonistA longed for someone to love . One night , ProtagonistA saw a shooting star streaking across the sky , and ProtagonistA made a wish . ProtagonistA wished for someone to love ProtagonistA , and to share ProtagonistA's kingdom with ProtagonistA . The next night , ProtagonistA saw the same shooting star , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's wish had been granted . 
ProtagonistA , sat at ProtagonistB's desk , ProtagonistA's hooves resting on the very smooth surface of the paper . ProtagonistA had been curious about this strange object ever since ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB using it . ProtagonistA had been trying to figure out how to use it ProtagonistA , but so far , ProtagonistA had n't had much success . Suddenly , the door to the room opened and ProtagonistB walked in . ProtagonistA quickly jumped off the desk , hoping ProtagonistA had n't been caught . But ProtagonistB just smiled and walked over to ProtagonistA . It 's okay , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB do n't mind if ProtagonistA use ProtagonistB's desk . In fact , ProtagonistB think it 's great that ProtagonistA 're curious about it . ProtagonistB then showed ProtagonistA how to use the desk . ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA how to hold the pen and how to make marks on the paper . ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA immediately started trying to write ProtagonistA's name . That 's great , ProtagonistA !  said ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA 'll be writing like a pro in no time . ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had finally figured out how to use the desk . And it was all thanks to ProtagonistA's curiosity . 
ProtagonistA stood in the doorway of the bank , and the crystal ball was spinning in ProtagonistA's fingers . The ball suddenly stopped and ProtagonistA saw a vision of ProtagonistA robbing the bank . ProtagonistA was shocked at first , but then ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA could use ProtagonistA's power to see the future to ProtagonistA's advantage . ProtagonistA quickly put ProtagonistA's plan into action and within minutes , ProtagonistA had the money from the bank in ProtagonistA's hands . ProtagonistA was laughing as ProtagonistA ran away from the scene of the crime , knowing that ProtagonistA had gotten away with the perfect crime . 
ProtagonistA cracked open ProtagonistA's newspaper , nudged the option beneath the headline Today , ProtagonistA was going to write a story about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been meaning to for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had first met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was an interesting person , to say the least . ProtagonistB was always well - dressed and put - together , but there was something about ProtagonistB that made ProtagonistA want to know more . As ProtagonistA began to write , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA getting more and more into the story . ProtagonistA detailed ProtagonistB's life , from ProtagonistB's childhood to ProtagonistB's present day . ProtagonistA wrote about ProtagonistB's successes and ProtagonistB's failures , ProtagonistB's relationships and ProtagonistB's friendships . ProtagonistA even included a quote from ProtagonistB , about the importance of always moving forward . By the time ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had really captured who ProtagonistB was as a person . ProtagonistA hoped that ProtagonistA's readers would feel the same way . 
ProtagonistA whistled an old , hoof - tired tune as ProtagonistA peered around the edge of ProtagonistA's cottage at the vast , arid expanse beyond the great umbrella of emerald leaves that crowned the ceiling . ProtagonistA had been living in this cottage for years , ever since ProtagonistA had been forced to retire from ProtagonistA's post as a royal guard . It was n't the life ProtagonistA had envisioned for ProtagonistA , but it was peaceful and ProtagonistA was content . ProtagonistA had been born and raised in the bustling city of Camelot . As a child , ProtagonistA had dreamed of becoming a knight like ProtagonistA's father . When ProtagonistA was old enough , ProtagonistA enlisted in the guard and worked ProtagonistA's way up the ranks . For years , ProtagonistA served the ProtagonistC and queen faithfully . But then , one day , ProtagonistB was hired . ProtagonistB ProtagonistA was soon demoted and then , eventually , forced to retire . ProtagonistB , quickly became ProtagonistC's favorite . ProtagonistB was always by ProtagonistC's side , protecting ProtagonistC and serving ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a twinge of jealousy , but ProtagonistA pushed it down . ProtagonistA was happy in ProtagonistA's cottage and did n't need ProtagonistC's approval . But now , as ProtagonistA looked out at the empty wasteland , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a sense of longing . ProtagonistA missed the excitement of Camelot . ProtagonistA missed the king and queen . And , most of all , ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA sat up on the front step of the house with ProtagonistA's eyes closed . ProtagonistA was trying to remember the dream ProtagonistA had just been having . It was something about a rabbit and a hole . ProtagonistA could n't quite remember . ProtagonistA heard someone coming up the walk and ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes . It was ProtagonistB .  Good morning , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB was just out for ProtagonistB's morning walk and ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA sitting here . ProtagonistB hope ProtagonistA 're doing well .   ProtagonistA 'm fine , thank ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA was just trying to remember a dream ProtagonistA had .   That 's interesting ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB sometimes have trouble remembering ProtagonistB's dreams , too . Well , ProtagonistB 'll let ProtagonistA get back to it . Have a good day .   Thanks , you too ,  ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB walk away and then ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes again . Maybe if ProtagonistA concentrated hard enough , ProtagonistA could remember the dream . 
ProtagonistA was driving home from the hospital after a terrible accident in which ProtagonistA had been struck by a bus . ProtagonistA was in a lot of pain and ProtagonistA's head was throbbing . As ProtagonistA drove , ProtagonistA saw a sign for a new development called Sunrise Estates . ProtagonistA decided to turn in and take a look . The development was beautiful , with pristine houses and well - manicured lawns . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could really start fresh here . ProtagonistA drove up to the model home and got out to take a look around . Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's head and ProtagonistA collapsed to the ground . ProtagonistA was unconscious for several minutes . When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was in a hospital bed . The doctors told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had suffered a stroke and would not be able to drive or live on ProtagonistA's own anymore . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA had been so close to starting over , but now ProtagonistA's life was completely changed . ProtagonistA would have to rely on others for everything from now on . 
ProtagonistA had been sitting in the library for hours , poring over old books and dusty scrolls . ProtagonistA was looking for any clues that could help ProtagonistA find the lost city of Atlantis . ProtagonistA was getting close , ProtagonistA could feel it . The first thing ProtagonistA had to do was find a way to get ProtagonistA's notebook out of the trunk behind the desk . ProtagonistA had been hiding it there for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had started ProtagonistA's research . If the librarian found it , ProtagonistA would be kicked out for sure . ProtagonistA stood up and stretched ProtagonistA's arms . ProtagonistA was getting a cramp in ProtagonistA back from leaning over the desk for so long . ProtagonistA looked around the library , making sure that no one was watching , and then quickly opened the trunk and grabbed ProtagonistA's notebook . ProtagonistA tucked it under ProtagonistA's arm and sat back down at the desk , opening it to the page where ProtagonistA had left off . ProtagonistA was so close , ProtagonistA could feel it . ProtagonistA just needed one more piece of the puzzle and ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA would find Atlantis . ProtagonistA just had to keep looking . 
ProtagonistA was a hasty and groping traveller , always carrying some form of burdens on ProtagonistA's back , but the Seven Seas of Latron on the banks of the river had always been a friendlier place . ProtagonistA had been coming here since ProtagonistA was a child and the memories of ProtagonistA's mother and father taking ProtagonistA here were some of ProtagonistA's fondest . But now , as ProtagonistA approached the Seven Seas , ProtagonistA could see that something was wrong . The waters were murky and the air felt heavy . ProtagonistA could sense that something bad was about to happen . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that the riverbank was littered with the bodies of animals - fish , birds , mammals . It was as if they had all been poisoned . ProtagonistA was horrified . This was ProtagonistA's beloved Seven Seas , and it was being destroyed . ProtagonistA had to do something . But what could ProtagonistA do ? ProtagonistA was just one person . Then ProtagonistA remembered ProtagonistA's mother 's words :  If ProtagonistA ever feel lost , ProtagonistA , just remember that ProtagonistA have the power to make a difference . ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA had to do . ProtagonistA had to warn the people of Latron about what was happening to the Seven Seas . ProtagonistA raced back to the town as fast as ProtagonistA could and sounded the alarm . The people of Latron were shocked and horrified , but they knew they had to act . Together , they worked to clean up the river and to find out what had caused the pollution . It was a long and difficult process , but eventually the Seven Seas were restored to their former glory . And ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had made a difference . 
ProtagonistA was going through ProtagonistA's old keepsakes from when ProtagonistA was younger . ProtagonistA came across a little book that ProtagonistA used to read all the time . ProtagonistA remembered how much ProtagonistA loved the stories in the book . ProtagonistA wondered why ProtagonistA had never read it again . ProtagonistA decided to read it again . ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA had found the book again . 
ProtagonistA had been through so much , so many times , that ProtagonistA 'd reached the point where ProtagonistA 'd stopped caring what happened to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was numb to the pain , the hurt , the suffering . ProtagonistA 'd been through it all before and ProtagonistA knew that , eventually , ProtagonistA would make it through again . This time , though , ProtagonistA was tired . Tired of fighting , tired of struggling . ProtagonistA just wanted to give up . So , when ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in the middle of yet another difficult situation , ProtagonistA did n't fight . ProtagonistA did n't try to find a way out . ProtagonistA just let go and allowed ProtagonistA to be consumed by the darkness . ProtagonistA was done fighting . Done struggling . Done caring . 
ProtagonistA stepped out of the greenhouse , whirled , and threw ProtagonistA's head back . The sun was setting and the sky was a beautiful orange . ProtagonistA breathed in the fresh air and smiled . It was good to be alive . 
ProtagonistA had been waiting for the moment , talking to ProtagonistB , when it would happen : here were ProtagonistA's feet , well - nigh barefoot , with their unkempt , patchy hair , and ProtagonistA's hands folded under the lids , as if ProtagonistA had been carrying them for some months , so that ProtagonistA's hands should have a little more room , and ProtagonistA's fingers a little less clumsy , than when ProtagonistA was twelve . It had been a long time since ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was excited to finally be able to talk to ProtagonistB about what was happening in ProtagonistA's life . When ProtagonistA was younger , ProtagonistA had been scared of ProtagonistB , but now ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a kind and wise old man . So , ProtagonistA , what have ProtagonistA been up to ?  ProtagonistB asked , after they had exchanged pleasantries . Oh , not much ,  ProtagonistA replied .  ProtagonistA 've just been waiting for the moment , talking to ProtagonistB , when it would happen . And what is it that ProtagonistA 're waiting for , ProtagonistB's dear?I'm waiting for ProtagonistA's feet to grow , so that ProtagonistA can go barefoot more often . ProtagonistA 'm also waiting for ProtagonistA's hands to be a little less clumsy , so that ProtagonistA can do more things with them . I see ,  ProtagonistB said , nodding ProtagonistB's head .  And why do ProtagonistA want to go barefoot more often?I do n't know ,  ProtagonistA said .  It just feels right . Like it 's something ProtagonistA 'm supposed to do . And why do ProtagonistA want ProtagonistA's hands to be less clumsy?So that ProtagonistA can do more things with them . ProtagonistA want to be able to write and draw and build things . I see ,  ProtagonistB said again .  And have ProtagonistA been doing any of those things?Yes ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 've been writing stories and drawing pictures . And ProtagonistA just finished building a model of a castle out of cardboard boxes . That sounds like a lot of fun ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA 're very good at all of those things . I am ,  ProtagonistA said .  But ProtagonistA 'm still waiting for the moment when it will all come together and ProtagonistA 'll be able to do even more . I'm sure that moment will come , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  Just keep waiting and working hard , and it will happen .  
I remember ProtagonistA ; I remember ProtagonistA being born a little after 1852 . ProtagonistA was of a small family , and though no one in that family should have been more than ten years my senior , ProtagonistA's father was very strong and good - looking , but had no money . ProtagonistA had everything else that was desired , and everything ProtagonistA asked for was granted without any regard to the wants of others . 
ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's wings for more than a year when ProtagonistA discovered what ProtagonistB , had been planning for a good long while . It seemed that ProtagonistB had been secretly stockpiling weapons and planning to overthrow the king . When ProtagonistA confronted ProtagonistB about it , ProtagonistB tried to kill ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was able to escape , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to warn the king . ProtagonistA flew as fast as ProtagonistA could to the palace and told the king what was happening . The king and his army were able to stop ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's rebels before they could do any damage . ProtagonistA was hailed as a hero and ProtagonistA was able to live happily ever after . 
ProtagonistA was excited to be embarking on ProtagonistA's voyage to the new world of the North . ProtagonistA was filled with the cheer of ProtagonistA's captain and the joy of ProtagonistA's crew . ProtagonistA hoped for the vast riches that lay in store for ProtagonistA . The voyage was long and arduous , but eventually they arrived in the new world . ProtagonistA was amazed by the sights and sounds of this new land . ProtagonistA quickly made friends with the locals and began to learn about the culture and customs . The new world was everything ProtagonistA had hoped for and more . ProtagonistA was filled with a sense of wonder and adventure . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistA's journey to the North . 
ProtagonistA should have known better . ProtagonistA was standing on the edge of a granite threshold , in the middle of a war , and ProtagonistA was not winning . The general said ,  As a matter of course , ProtagonistA 's here on trial . ProtagonistA 's not going to be able to keep it up all night .  
ProtagonistA peered into ProtagonistA's book , half - listening , half - expecting ProtagonistA's sister to speak . It had been a long day , and ProtagonistA was looking forward to losing ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's favorite story . But ProtagonistA's sister 's voice kept interrupting ProtagonistA's thoughts . ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA listening to me?Yes , ProtagonistA 'm listening ,  ProtagonistA said , trying to sound patient . I was just wondering if ProtagonistA could help me with my homework . ProtagonistA sighed .  ProtagonistA 'm trying to read , ca n't it wait?But I need ProtagonistA's help . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's book and turned to ProtagonistA's sister .  Fine , what do you need?As ProtagonistA's sister explained ProtagonistA's homework problem , ProtagonistA's mind wandered back to ProtagonistA's book . ProtagonistA could n't wait to get back to it . 
ProtagonistA sat down and just watched as ProtagonistB squatted beside ProtagonistA and watched ProtagonistB draw ProtagonistB's bow and day out . ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by ProtagonistB's ability to shoot an arrow with such accuracy , and ProtagonistA was determined to learn how to do it ProtagonistA . As ProtagonistA watched , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB take careful aim and then release the arrow . It flew straight and true , hitting the target dead center . ProtagonistA clapped ProtagonistA's hands in excitement , eager to try it ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA how to hold the bow and how to position the arrow . ProtagonistB then helped ProtagonistA take aim and release the arrow . It flew wide of the target , but ProtagonistA was thrilled nonetheless . ProtagonistA continued to practice , and before long , ProtagonistA was hitting the target just as accurately as ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was proud of ProtagonistA and grateful to ProtagonistB for teaching ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had waited all summer for ProtagonistA's chance to go to the water park . ProtagonistA had begged ProtagonistA's parents to take ProtagonistA and they finally relented . When ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA was so excited to go down the slides . ProtagonistA went down the first one and it was so much fun . ProtagonistA went down the second one and it was even more fun . ProtagonistA was having so much fun that ProtagonistA did n't want to leave . 
ProtagonistA does n't think ProtagonistA 'll be going back to school , ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistA 's been homeschooled ProtagonistA's whole life , and ProtagonistA 's never even been to a public school . ProtagonistA's parents are a bit odd , and they 've always been really strict about ProtagonistA's education . ProtagonistA 's never even been allowed to go to a sleepover or anything . But now that ProtagonistA 's turning 18 , ProtagonistA 's thinking about maybe going to college . It 's something ProtagonistA 's always wanted to do , and ProtagonistA 's finally old enough to make ProtagonistA's own decisions . ProtagonistA 's not sure what ProtagonistA's parents will say , but ProtagonistA 's going to talk to them about it soon . Wish ProtagonistA's luck ! 
ProtagonistA sat by ProtagonistA's window and hoped that the sun was n't up . ProtagonistA had been up all night , and ProtagonistA was exhausted . ProtagonistA wanted to sleep , but ProtagonistA was afraid that if ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA would miss the sun . ProtagonistA had been waiting for it to rise for hours , and ProtagonistA did n't want to miss it . Finally , ProtagonistA saw the first ray of sunlight , and ProtagonistA sighed in relief . ProtagonistA watched as the sun slowly rose in the sky , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's eyelids getting heavy . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should stay awake , but ProtagonistA could n't help it . ProtagonistA fell asleep , and ProtagonistA missed the sun . 
ProtagonistA sat at ProtagonistA's desk and watched as ProtagonistB leaned ProtagonistB's head onto ProtagonistA's shoulder . It was a comfortable silence between them , one that did n't need to be filled with words . ProtagonistA was content just to sit there and be with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was going through a tough time and ProtagonistA wanted to be there for ProtagonistB , even if it was just in silence . 
ProtagonistA was walking through the woods , thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how ProtagonistA wished things were different . ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistB and how ProtagonistB always seemed to be so strict with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could just leave and never come back . As ProtagonistA was thinking these things , ProtagonistA heard a noise behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA turned around and saw a man with a knife , coming towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die . As the man got closer , ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA ,  Oh , f - f - fucks if ProtagonistA kill you now .  ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistB had not forbidden ProtagonistA to leave . 
ProtagonistA's world was on fire , and ProtagonistA did not know it , but ProtagonistA knew it was the end . The flames licked at ProtagonistA's skin and ProtagonistA could feel the heat of them on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA could hear the screams of the people around ProtagonistA , and the sound of the buildings collapsing . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get out of there , but ProtagonistA did n't know how . ProtagonistA tried to run , but ProtagonistA's legs would n't move . ProtagonistA tried to call for help , but ProtagonistA's voice would n't work . ProtagonistA was trapped . The flames surrounded ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistA's skin burning . ProtagonistA knew this was the end . 
ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's home world of Equestria when ProtagonistA was eight years old . ProtagonistA was the only one of ProtagonistA's kind , a human , and ProtagonistA did n't fit in . ProtagonistA was always getting into trouble , and ProtagonistA's parents had had enough . They sent ProtagonistA to live with ProtagonistA's aunt in the human world , hoping that ProtagonistA would learn some responsibility . ProtagonistA was not happy in the human world . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's friends and the magic of Equestria . ProtagonistA was always getting into trouble , and ProtagonistA's aunt was always yelling at ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA ran away from home , hoping to find ProtagonistA's way back to Equestria . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to get there , but ProtagonistA was determined . ProtagonistA walked for days , until ProtagonistA came to a strange door in the middle of the forest . ProtagonistA opened it and walked through , into a whole new world . ProtagonistA was amazed . ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it . ProtagonistA was soon lost , but ProtagonistA did n't mind . ProtagonistA was happy to be back in Equestria , even if ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to get home . 
ProtagonistA was lying on the floor of ProtagonistA's room , bending forward . ProtagonistA had been there for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had received the news . ProtagonistA could n't believe it was true , that ProtagonistA's life was over . It did n't seem real . ProtagonistA was only twenty - five . It was n't supposed to happen like this . ProtagonistA heard the door open and ProtagonistB came in . ProtagonistB sat down on the floor next to ProtagonistA and put ProtagonistB's arm around ProtagonistA . I'm so sorry , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said . ProtagonistA turned to ProtagonistB and buried ProtagonistA's face in ProtagonistB's shoulder . ProtagonistA cried until ProtagonistA had no tears left . Then ProtagonistA got up and walked out of the room . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep going , even though ProtagonistA did n't know how . 
Two days ago ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends had an idea : they would all bake cakes and then have a competition to see who could decorate their cake the best . So that 's what they did . ProtagonistA's cake was a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and chocolate chips . ProtagonistA's friends ' cakes were all different flavors , but they all looked delicious . The competition was close , but in the end ProtagonistA's cake won ! 
ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistA's hoof out of ProtagonistB's eyes , but fished out a few strands of pony hair , like ProtagonistA always had . It was a habit that ProtagonistA had developed over the years , ever since ProtagonistB was born . Whenever ProtagonistA would find a stray hair on ProtagonistB's head , ProtagonistA would carefully remove it , making sure not to hurt ProtagonistB . It was a small act of love that ProtagonistA did every day , and it always made ProtagonistA feel better . Even though ProtagonistB was now a grown pony , ProtagonistA still liked to do it . It was a way for ProtagonistA to show ProtagonistA's love and care for ProtagonistB , even if ProtagonistB was no longer a little filly . 
ProtagonistA stopped smoking and looked up from the book ProtagonistA was reading . ProtagonistA had been trying to quit for a while , but this was the first time ProtagonistA had been able to stick with it . ProtagonistA felt good about ProtagonistA and was determined to keep going . ProtagonistA was halfway through the book when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had been smoking without even thinking about it . ProtagonistA put the book down and decided to go for a walk to clear ProtagonistA's head . As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA thought about all the reasons ProtagonistA wanted to quit smoking . ProtagonistA wanted to be healthy , save money , and set a good example for ProtagonistA's kids . ProtagonistA was determined to make this work and to never go back to smoking . 
When ProtagonistA woke , ProtagonistA wakened up as ProtagonistA always did . But this time , something was different . ProtagonistA could n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but something in the air was different . ProtagonistA got out of bed and walked to the window , looking out at the street below . It was then that ProtagonistA saw it . The world was different . The colors were brighter , the people were walking around with a skip in their step . It was as if everyone was happy . ProtagonistA rubbed ProtagonistA's eyes , thinking ProtagonistA was still dreaming . But when ProtagonistA looked back out the window , the scene was still there . ProtagonistA was wide awake , and the world was different . ProtagonistA did n't know how or why , but ProtagonistA knew that something amazing had happened . 
ProtagonistA had always wished ProtagonistA had been born in a different time and place . ProtagonistA was born in the early 1900s in a small town in the Midwest . ProtagonistA was the oldest of six children and ProtagonistA's parents were very strict . They did n't allow ProtagonistA to go to the movies or out with ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA was always doing chores around the house or helping ProtagonistA's mother in the garden . ProtagonistA dreamed of a life where ProtagonistA could travel and see the world . ProtagonistA wanted to be an actress or a singer . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could never have that life in ProtagonistA's small town . One day , ProtagonistA saw a group of girls walking down the street . They were laughing and having a great time . They were wearing short skirts and high heels . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could be like them . ProtagonistA wanted to be free and have fun . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never have that life in ProtagonistA's small town . 
ProtagonistA should 've said no . That 's what ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA looked down at ProtagonistA's hooves . ProtagonistA should 've said no to the Mad Hatter 's tea party . But ProtagonistA did n't and now ProtagonistA was stuck here , dancing and singing with a bunch of animals . ProtagonistA was having a good time , ProtagonistA could n't deny that . But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should 've said no . 
ProtagonistA had been very pondering how to spend the week before wearing ProtagonistA's crown . ProtagonistA thought about all of the fun ProtagonistA could have and all of the people ProtagonistA could see . ProtagonistA also thought about how ProtagonistA would feel when ProtagonistA was wearing ProtagonistA's crown . Finally , ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA would spend the week before wearing ProtagonistA's crown by doing something ProtagonistA had never done before . ProtagonistA would go on an adventure ! ProtagonistA would explore the world and see all of the amazing things it had to offer . ProtagonistA would make new friends and create memories that would last a lifetime . 
ProtagonistA had never managed to get used to the idea that ProtagonistA had to be the only pony on the grounds or the ground in order to do anything without prompting . Even though ProtagonistA had been living in the same house for years , ProtagonistA still felt like ProtagonistA needed to be on the lookout for any ponies that might be lurking around . It made ProtagonistA feel safe , but it also made ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistA was always on the verge of being caught . 
ProtagonistA had been looking forward to ProtagonistA's apple all day . ProtagonistA had been extra careful to not bruise it when ProtagonistA packed it in ProtagonistA's lunch bag . But now , sitting on the floor of ProtagonistA's hoof , all ProtagonistA had left was a sad , mushy mess . ProtagonistA frowned at it , wondering what ProtagonistA could have done differently . Maybe ProtagonistA should have eaten it sooner . Or maybe ProtagonistA should have put it in a different bag . Either way , ProtagonistA was now left with nothing but a mushy apple and a whole lot of disappointment . 
ProtagonistA had only once thought ProtagonistA would have a family , but now ProtagonistA believed that it was n't such a bad idea . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner and never really felt the need for a partner or children , but as ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA started to feel differently . Maybe it was because all ProtagonistA's friends were getting married and having kids , or maybe ProtagonistA was just feeling lonely , but whatever the reason , ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA wanted to try for a family of ProtagonistA's own . ProtagonistA started dating and went on a few dates with some nice guys , but none of them felt like the right fit . Then ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was different than any of the other guys ProtagonistA had dated . ProtagonistB was kind , funny , and most importantly , ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistA was the only person in the world that mattered . They started dating seriously and after a few months , they got married . ProtagonistA was happy and felt like ProtagonistA had finally found the family ProtagonistA always wanted . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had two beautiful children together and they were always surrounded by love . ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA made the right decision when ProtagonistA decided to try for a family of ProtagonistA's own . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's hind legs on the deck of the large ship , watching the sun set on the horizon . ProtagonistA had never seen anything so beautiful in ProtagonistA's life . The colors were so vibrant and the sky was so clear . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could reach out and touch the sun . 
When ProtagonistA froze in the doorway of ProtagonistA's house , ProtagonistB came toward ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was a tall , dark figure , draped in a cloak that seemed to absorb all the light around it . In ProtagonistB's hand ProtagonistB held a long , sharp blade . ProtagonistA's heart raced as ProtagonistB approached ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA tried to scream , but no sound would come out . ProtagonistA tried to run , but ProtagonistA's feet were rooted to the spot . ProtagonistA was paralyzed with fear . ProtagonistB reached ProtagonistA and grabbed ProtagonistA by the throat . ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistB's cold , slimy skin against ProtagonistA's own . ProtagonistA could smell ProtagonistB's foul breath . ProtagonistB stared at ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's cold , dead eyes and then ProtagonistB spoke . I've come for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 're coming with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA could n't resist as ProtagonistB dragged ProtagonistA away . ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistB was taking ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA knew it could n't be good . ProtagonistA was terrified of what ProtagonistB might do to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA tried to struggle , but it was no use . ProtagonistB was too strong . ProtagonistA was completely helpless against ProtagonistB . Eventually , ProtagonistB brought ProtagonistA to a dark , dank dungeon . ProtagonistB threw ProtagonistA into a cell and then locked the door . ProtagonistA was left alone in the darkness , terrified of what ProtagonistB might do to ProtagonistA next . 
There 's ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA ai n't going nowhere . ProtagonistA 's been stuck in this small town ProtagonistA's whole life and ProtagonistA 's just about had enough . Everyone here knows ProtagonistA's name and ProtagonistA's story , and ProtagonistA 's sick of it . ProtagonistA 's ready to get out and see the world . ProtagonistA 's been saving up for years , and ProtagonistA 's finally got enough money to buy a one - way ticket out of here . ProtagonistA 's not sure where ProtagonistA 's going to go , but ProtagonistA knows it 's time for a change . ProtagonistA 's packed ProtagonistA's bags and ProtagonistA 's ready to go . The only thing left to do is say goodbye to ProtagonistA's friends and family . ProtagonistA knows they 'll miss ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA ca n't stay here any longer . It 's time for ProtagonistA to start a new adventure . 
ProtagonistA was lying on ProtagonistA's back , gazing up into the sky . ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace wash over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA watched the clouds drift by . ProtagonistA was content just to lie there and take in the beauty of the day . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistA sat up and looked around , but there was no one there . ProtagonistA shrugged and lay back down , but the voice came again , louder this time .  ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistA , where are ProtagonistA ?  It was ProtagonistB's voice . ProtagonistA got up and followed the sound until ProtagonistA came to the edge of a cliff . ProtagonistA looked down and saw ProtagonistB far below , clutching at the edge of a precipice .  ProtagonistA ! Help ProtagonistB !  ProtagonistB cried . Without hesitation , ProtagonistA leapt off the cliff and flew down to save ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA leaned against the wall of the library , ProtagonistA's huge body pressed against the paper , ProtagonistA's hooves whinnying . ProtagonistA was a beautiful horse , but ProtagonistA was also very old . ProtagonistA's owner , Mrs. White , had died a few years ago , and since then , ProtagonistA had been living in the library . The librarians took care of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was happy there . But now , ProtagonistA was getting old , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would soon have to leave the library . ProtagonistA was sad , but ProtagonistA was also excited to see what the world outside the library was like . 
ProtagonistA stretched out ProtagonistA's forelegs , rested the hind legs on the side of ProtagonistA's neck , and looked around . The sun was setting and the sky was a beautiful orange . ProtagonistA saw the trees and the flowers and the birds and felt so happy . ProtagonistA was so lucky to be alive . 
ProtagonistA looked around the vast plain of the agricultural landscape that surrounded ProtagonistA's castle . It was a beautiful sight , but it was also a reminder of the great responsibility ProtagonistA had . As queen , ProtagonistA was responsible for the wellbeing of all ProtagonistA's subjects , and ProtagonistA took that responsibility very seriously . ProtagonistA knew that the key to a prosperous kingdom was a thriving economy , and that meant making sure that the farmers had what they needed to produce a bountiful harvest . ProtagonistA would have to make sure that the castle had a good supply of food , so that ProtagonistA's people would never go hungry . 
ProtagonistA stood and watched ProtagonistA's sister Dash ProtagonistB float by . It was a beautiful sight . The sun was setting and the sky was a beautiful orange . ProtagonistB looked so peaceful as ProtagonistB floated by . 
ProtagonistB was lying down under the wing of ProtagonistA , staring up at ProtagonistA's blue and white Pip Puff . ProtagonistB was thinking about how much ProtagonistB loved flying and how happy ProtagonistB was to be able to share that love with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB felt a warm breeze blowing through the feathers on ProtagonistB's back and knew that ProtagonistA was also enjoying the moment . 
ProtagonistA had spent the day trying to convince ProtagonistB to let ProtagonistA's ride to the Everfree . ProtagonistA was tired of being stuck in ProtagonistC and wanted to explore the forest . ProtagonistB was hesitant , but finally relented . They set off on their journey and ProtagonistA was soon lost in thought , imagining all the adventures ProtagonistA would have . Suddenly , ProtagonistA was brought out of ProtagonistA's reverie by a rustling in the bushes . ProtagonistB had disappeared and ProtagonistA was now alone . ProtagonistA called out , but there was no answer . ProtagonistA began to feel scared and alone . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name . It was ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistB had been hiding , trying to scare ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistA was not amused . ProtagonistA was angry and scared . ProtagonistA did n't want to go back to ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistA did n't want to stay in the forest either . ProtagonistA was stuck in the middle , not knowing what to do . 
At the time , ProtagonistA was just about to head off to meet ProtagonistB . They were n't going to let ProtagonistA leave until ProtagonistA had convinced ProtagonistB to do so . ProtagonistA had been trying to get ProtagonistB to come with ProtagonistA for weeks , but ProtagonistB always said no . ProtagonistA was finally going to convince ProtagonistB today . ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB's house and knocked on the door . When ProtagonistB answered , ProtagonistA started talking . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the great time they would have and how much fun they would have . ProtagonistA finally convinced ProtagonistB to come with ProtagonistA and they left for their adventure . 
ProtagonistA woke up to the sound of the engines hum and ProtagonistA sat up , rubbing ProtagonistA's sleepy eyes . ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was in the middle of a grand , wide , open airship . The sun was just peeking over the horizon , and the sky was a beautiful orange . ProtagonistA got up and walked to the edge of the airship , admiring the view . ProtagonistA saw the other airships in the fleet , and the ground far below . ProtagonistA felt a sense of awe and wonder at the sight . 
ProtagonistA was a princess and ProtagonistA was not going anywhere . ProtagonistA was content to stay in ProtagonistA's castle and rule ProtagonistA's kingdom . ProtagonistA had a loyal subjects and a loving family . ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life the way it was . One day , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA's castle and asked ProtagonistA to marry ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistA eventually agreed . ProtagonistA left her kingdom behind and went off to live with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's new life , but ProtagonistA always missed ProtagonistA's old kingdom . 
ProtagonistA , was perched in ProtagonistA's perch on the port bow of the vessel , watching the sun set over the waters of the Great Sea . The colors were so beautiful , ProtagonistA thought , and the air was so fresh and salty . ProtagonistA loved the sea and everything about it . ProtagonistA loved the way it smelled , the way it sounded , and the way it made ProtagonistA feel . ProtagonistA felt so free and alive when ProtagonistA was on the sea . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a loud noise and felt the vessel shake . ProtagonistA realized that they were under attack by pirates ! ProtagonistA quickly ran to ProtagonistA's cabin and grabbed ProtagonistA's sword . ProtagonistA ran back up on deck and started fighting the pirates . ProtagonistA was outnumbered and outmatched , but ProtagonistA fought with all ProtagonistA's might . ProtagonistA managed to kill a few of the pirates before ProtagonistA was finally captured . The pirates tied ProtagonistA up and brought ProtagonistA to their ship . They locked ProtagonistA in a cell and left ProtagonistA there to rot . ProtagonistA was so angry and frustrated . ProtagonistA had never been one to give up , but it seemed like there was no way out of this one . ProtagonistA was going to die in that cell unless ProtagonistA could find a way to escape . 
ProtagonistA was standing there , wondering how to explain ProtagonistA's pregnancy without sounding like an idiot . ProtagonistA had only been with ProtagonistB for a few months , and ProtagonistA was already pregnant . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to tell ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistB would be mad . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and decided to just tell ProtagonistB the truth . ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's house and knocked on the door . When ProtagonistB answered , ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA 'm pregnant . At first , ProtagonistB did n't say anything . ProtagonistB just stood there , staring at ProtagonistA . Then , ProtagonistB asked ,  ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA was n't sure , but ProtagonistA thought it had something to do with the fact that they had unprotected sex . ProtagonistB was quiet for a moment , then ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB 'm not ready to be a father . ProtagonistA was heartbroken . ProtagonistA had been hoping ProtagonistB would be happy about the news . ProtagonistA turned and walked away , tears streaming down ProtagonistA's face . 
ProtagonistA had ruptured ProtagonistA's ACL playing soccer with ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA had been told by the doctor that ProtagonistA would never be able to play again . This was devastating news for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was also told that ProtagonistA would need to have surgery to repair the damage . This would be a long and difficult recovery process . After much thought , ProtagonistA decided to have the surgery . During ProtagonistA's recovery , ProtagonistB , was by ProtagonistA's side every step of the way . ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA with everything , from going to the bathroom to getting dressed . ProtagonistA was very grateful for ProtagonistB's help . Without ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would not have been able to get through ProtagonistA's recovery . Now , ProtagonistA is back to playing soccer and is even better than before . ProtagonistA is truly thankful for ProtagonistB and the support ProtagonistB provided during ProtagonistA's time of need . 
“ Now , ” said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA sat down in ProtagonistA's chair , “ ProtagonistA want to tell you a story . ” ProtagonistA paused for a moment , collecting ProtagonistA's thoughts . “ Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA lived in a world that was very different from our own . In ProtagonistA's world , there were creatures called Jabberwocks . They were big and scary , and they would eat people if they caught them . ProtagonistA paused again , ProtagonistA's eyes wide as ProtagonistA remembered the Jabberwocks . “ One day , ProtagonistA decided ProtagonistA was going to kill a Jabberwock . ProtagonistA went into the forest , where they lived , and ProtagonistA found one . ProtagonistA fought it , and ProtagonistA killed it . ProtagonistA leaned back in ProtagonistA's chair , a satisfied look on ProtagonistA's face . “ And that ’s the end of the story , ” ProtagonistA said . The other children in the room were wide - eyed , and they stared at ProtagonistA in disbelief . They had never heard of such a thing happening in their world . ProtagonistA just smiled and shrugged . “ It ’s true , ” ProtagonistA said . “ ProtagonistA killed a Jabberwock . ” 
ProtagonistA sat in the back seat of ProtagonistA's pink and white pony wagon and watched the clouds drift away . ProtagonistA loved the way they looked like big , fluffy marshmallows . ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear ProtagonistA's mom coming up behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistA's mom asked . Just watching the clouds , mom ,  ProtagonistA replied . Well , ProtagonistA need to come help me with dinner ,  ProtagonistA's mom said . Okay ,  ProtagonistA said , getting out of the wagon . As ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistA's mom into the house , ProtagonistA could n't help but smile . ProtagonistA was so lucky to have such a wonderful life . 
ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and sent a gentle , sinking beam of red light across the smooth white ground . It was so beautiful here , so peaceful . ProtagonistA had always loved coming to this place , ever since ProtagonistA was a little girl . It was ProtagonistA's happy place . But now , everything was different . The world was different . It was a scary place now . ProtagonistA sighed and continued to move the beam of light across the ground . ProtagonistA did n't know what else to do . ProtagonistA was so lost , so alone . But then , ProtagonistA saw something in the distance . A light . A beacon of hope . ProtagonistA started to walk towards the light , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized it was a campfire . There were people there . People who could help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , and soon ProtagonistA was running towards the fire . ProtagonistA was safe now . ProtagonistA was finally safe . 
ProtagonistA was at a party with ProtagonistA's friends when ProtagonistA saw the funniest thing . ProtagonistA laughed so hard ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was dead . ProtagonistA's friends were worried about ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was just fine . ProtagonistA was just enjoying a good laugh . 
ProtagonistA did n't come out of the desert for no good reason , said ProtagonistA , as the words struck up in ProtagonistA's throat . ProtagonistA had been walking for days , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and ProtagonistA's throat was dry . ProtagonistA had been following a map that ProtagonistA found , hoping it would lead ProtagonistA to water . And now , finally , ProtagonistA had arrived . In front of ProtagonistA was a large oasis , and ProtagonistA could see people and animals gathered around it , drinking and bathing and laughing . ProtagonistA had made it . ProtagonistA had found the oasis . 
ProtagonistA was out for a run when ProtagonistA saw the bear . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA should be scared , but ProtagonistA's mind was calm and ProtagonistA's body was strong . ProtagonistA was able to keep running until ProtagonistA got to safety . 
ProtagonistA stood with ProtagonistA's hooves on the other side of the barrier , watching the ponies through the small crack in the glass . ProtagonistA had always wanted to be one of them , to feel the soft grass beneath ProtagonistA's hooves and the sun on ProtagonistA's back . But ProtagonistA knew that was never going to happen . ProtagonistA was born different , with hooves instead of hands . ProtagonistA's parents had tried to hide ProtagonistA away , but eventually the other ponies had found out . They had ridiculed ProtagonistA , called ProtagonistA a freak . So ProtagonistA had run away , to this place where ProtagonistA could watch them and feel like ProtagonistA belonged , even if it was from a distance . 
ProtagonistA lay awake overnight , dreaming of a new day in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA dreamed of a day where ProtagonistA was the one in charge , the one who made all the decisions . ProtagonistA dreamed of a day where ProtagonistA was the one who got to decide what everyone else did . It was a wonderful dream , and ProtagonistA woke up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the world . 
ProtagonistA stood in front of the camera , ProtagonistA's eyes bluish as a heart . ProtagonistA was wearing a white dress with blue flowers embroidered around the hem . ProtagonistA's hair was pulled back in a loose braid , and ProtagonistA had a small smile on ProtagonistA's face . The camera clicked , and ProtagonistA turned to the side , ProtagonistA's eyes still on the lens . 
ProtagonistA had been behind the wheel of the truck for nearly two hours and most of that time ProtagonistA did n't even care what the heck was happening around ProtagonistA . All ProtagonistA cared about was getting to ProtagonistA's destination . But now , as ProtagonistA was getting closer and closer , ProtagonistA started to pay more attention to ProtagonistA's surroundings . ProtagonistA saw the signs for the town ProtagonistA was looking for and ProtagonistA started to get excited . ProtagonistA was almost there . ProtagonistA could n't believe it . ProtagonistA had made it . ProtagonistA pulled into the town and stopped at the first gas station ProtagonistA saw . ProtagonistA needed to fill up before ProtagonistA went any further . ProtagonistA got out of the truck and stretched ProtagonistA's legs . It felt good to be out of the truck and moving around . ProtagonistA looked around and saw that the town was small and quaint . It was exactly what ProtagonistA was looking for . ProtagonistA went into the gas station and paid for ProtagonistA's gas . Then ProtagonistA got back in the truck and continued on ProtagonistA's way . ProtagonistA was going to find the perfect place to live in this town . ProtagonistA just knew it . 
ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's short life . ProtagonistA had been kidnapped , held captive , and was about to be sold into slavery . But ProtagonistA was saved by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB placed ProtagonistA in the care of ProtagonistA's only friend , Applejack , and told ProtagonistA to never give up hope . Now , years later , ProtagonistA is a strong and independent woman . ProtagonistA has never forgotten ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA is determined to find ProtagonistB one day to thank ProtagonistB . 
It was in the year 1763 when , in a county in western France , a small town named Vernay was formed , and the village of Neuve - Chalmers had its first residents . The name and the first and only dame which has ever been mentioned in the history of France , was Mary Moodie , a little lady of twenty - one , with a pretty face , fine features , and freckles , who , with ProtagonistB , was well known in the world for ProtagonistA's literary talent and for ProtagonistA's indomitable resolution . In the year 1763 , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were the only residents of the village of Neuve - Chalmers . The village was located in a county in western France and was newly formed . Despite being the only residents , the couple was well known in the world for their literary talent and ProtagonistA's indomitable resolution . The village of Neuve - Chalmers was a quiet and peaceful place . The only sounds that could be heard were the birds chirping and the leaves rustling in the wind . It was the perfect place to live if you wanted to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city . One day , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were out walking in the forest when they came across a small cottage . It looked like it had been abandoned for years . They decided to explore it and see if there was anything of value inside . As they entered the cottage , they were surprised to find that it was clean and well - kept . It was obvious that someone had been living there . They looked around and saw that there were clothes and food in the cupboards . It was then that they realized that they had stumbled upon someone 's secret hideaway . They decided to leave the cottage and not tell anyone about their discovery . It was clear that the person who was living there wanted to be left alone and they respected that . Although they never saw the person who was living in the cottage , Mary and John would often wonder about them . They would often talk about the person and speculate about their life . They would imagine what their story was and how they ended up living in a hidden cottage in the forest . The years went by and eventually , Mary and John passed away . But , their story and the story of the hidden cottage in the forest lived on . 
ProtagonistA had spent the majority of ProtagonistA's life as a woman . ProtagonistA had a successful career and a happy family . However , ProtagonistA always felt something was missing . ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like ProtagonistA was living in a man 's world . ProtagonistA decided to transition and become the woman ProtagonistA always knew ProtagonistA was . It was a difficult journey , but ProtagonistA made it through with the support of ProtagonistA's loved ones . ProtagonistA is now living ProtagonistA's best life as ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA rested ProtagonistA's forelegs on ProtagonistA's elbows and let out a deep breath . It had been a long day of work and ProtagonistA was ready to relax . ProtagonistA had just finished ProtagonistA's last project and was looking forward to a weekend of rest . ProtagonistA was about to get up from ProtagonistA's desk when ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door . ProtagonistA got up to answer it and found a delivery man with a package for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA signed for it and took it inside . ProtagonistA opened it up and found a beautiful dress inside . ProtagonistA held it up to ProtagonistA and smiled . It was perfect for the party ProtagonistA was going to next weekend . ProtagonistA could n't wait to wear it and show it off . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and dreamed of a new world . ProtagonistA dreamed of a world where ProtagonistA was the queen , and everyone bowed down to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA dreamed of a world where ProtagonistA had unlimited power and could do whatever ProtagonistA wanted . ProtagonistA dreamed of a world where ProtagonistA was the most beautiful and the most loved . ProtagonistA dreamed of a world where ProtagonistA never had to worry about anything . When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was still on ProtagonistA's haunches , but ProtagonistA was in a new world . 
Rainbow Dash and Eeyore were laying in bed in the middle of the deserted lake floor , on a warm day in late February , when ProtagonistA came into the room and slid ProtagonistA's hooves over the sheets . The two of them looked at each other , and then ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistA did n't mean to disturb you . It 's okay ,  said Rainbow Dash .  What 's up?I just wanted to say goodbye ,  said ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA 'm leaving for good this time . What ? Why ?  asked Rainbow Dash . ProtagonistA ca n't take it anymore ,  said ProtagonistA .  This place is just too depressing . ProtagonistA need to get out and see the world . But what about us ?  asked Eeyore . I'm sorry ,  said ProtagonistA .  But ProtagonistA ca n't stay here any longer . ProtagonistA hope you understand . With that , ProtagonistA turned and walked out of the room , leaving Rainbow Dash and Eeyore alone . 
ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes . ProtagonistA 'd never been bad in ProtagonistA's life , had ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistA 'd always been a sponge . A little like a strawberry . Pretty , even with a thin layer of frost on top . But ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes and ProtagonistA wanted more . ProtagonistA wanted to be bad . ProtagonistA wanted to be the kind of person who did n't care about anyone but ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA wanted to be the kind of person who would take what ProtagonistA wanted , no matter who it hurt . And so ProtagonistA became that person . ProtagonistA became the kind of person who would do anything to get what ProtagonistA wanted . And ProtagonistA loved it . ProtagonistA loved being bad . It was everything ProtagonistA 'd ever wanted . 
ProtagonistA had lived a long and happy life . ProtagonistA had been married for 50 years and had raised four children . But now , at the age of 76 , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's time was coming to an end . ProtagonistA had been diagnosed with a terminal illness and given only a few months to live . So , on the second day of August , ProtagonistA made the decision to end ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA took a large dose of sleeping pills and lay down in ProtagonistA's bed , knowing that ProtagonistA would never wake up again . As ProtagonistA drifted off to sleep , ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistA's family and all the happy memories ProtagonistA had made over the years . ProtagonistA was at peace knowing that ProtagonistA's life had been a good one . 
ProtagonistA looked rather like a bimbos older or younger than ProtagonistA had been when ProtagonistA first met ProtagonistB for the first time , considering the circumstances . ProtagonistA was wearing a tight dress and high heels , and ProtagonistA's hair was styled in a way that made ProtagonistA look like ProtagonistA was ready for a night out on the town . However , there was something about ProtagonistA that made ProtagonistB suspect that ProtagonistA might be up to something . ProtagonistB was not the type of person to judge someone based on their appearance , but ProtagonistB could not help but be suspicious of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB had met ProtagonistA for the first time a few weeks ago , and ProtagonistA seemed like ProtagonistA was hiding something . ProtagonistB was not sure what it was , but ProtagonistB was determined to find out . The next time ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB decided to follow ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was not sure what ProtagonistB was looking for , but ProtagonistB was hoping to find some clues . ProtagonistB followed ProtagonistA to a bar , and ProtagonistB watched as ProtagonistA talked to a few men . It was clear that ProtagonistA was flirting with them , and ProtagonistB was not sure what to think . ProtagonistB was about to leave when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA leave with one of the men . ProtagonistB followed them to a hotel , and ProtagonistB watched as they went into a room together . ProtagonistB was shocked , and ProtagonistB was not sure what to do . ProtagonistB was about to call the police when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA leave the room . It was clear that ProtagonistA had been up to something , and ProtagonistB was not sure what to do . ProtagonistB decided to confront ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA had been up to . ProtagonistA denied everything , but ProtagonistB was not convinced . ProtagonistB was about to call the police when ProtagonistA finally confessed . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had been meeting men for money . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA needed the money , and ProtagonistA did not know what else to do . ProtagonistB was shocked , and ProtagonistB did not know what to say . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to get help , and ProtagonistB would not be able to help ProtagonistA anymore . ProtagonistA was heartbroken , and ProtagonistA begged ProtagonistB to help ProtagonistA . However , ProtagonistB was not sure what ProtagonistB could do . ProtagonistB did not want to get involved , and ProtagonistB did not want to see ProtagonistA get hurt . In the end , ProtagonistB decided to call the police . ProtagonistA was taken away , and ProtagonistB never saw ProtagonistA again . ProtagonistB was relieved that ProtagonistB had made the right decision , and ProtagonistB was glad that ProtagonistB had not gotten involved . 
ProtagonistA was far away , so distant that it was hard to remember when ProtagonistA had come . ProtagonistA had been wandering for what felt like years , ever since ProtagonistA had fallen down the rabbit hole . At first , ProtagonistA had been excited by the adventure , but now ProtagonistA was just tired . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's home and ProtagonistA's family . ProtagonistA missed the warmth of the sun on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA missed the sound of laughter . ProtagonistA even missed the sound of ProtagonistA's own voice . ProtagonistA had been talking to ProtagonistA more and more lately , just to hear the sound of a human voice . ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA was losing ProtagonistA's mind . ProtagonistA was so tired of walking , but ProtagonistA could n't seem to stop . ProtagonistA had to keep going , even though ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going or why . ProtagonistA just kept walking , through the endless forest , until ProtagonistA came to a clearing . In the clearing was a beautiful house . It was so beautiful that ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA must be dreaming . ProtagonistA walked up to the house and knocked on the door . A kindly - looking woman answered the door .  Hello , ProtagonistA . Welcome to my home . Please , come in .  ProtagonistA walked into the house , and ProtagonistA was immediately filled with a sense of peace . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was finally home . 
ProtagonistA had never been to a Princess party before , and ProtagonistA loved the idea of it . ProtagonistA loved the idea of being treated like a princess , and ProtagonistA loved the idea of being surrounded by other princesses . When ProtagonistA arrived at the party , ProtagonistA was amazed by the decorations and the food . ProtagonistA was also amazed by the other princesses . They were all so beautiful , and they all seemed to be having so much fun . ProtagonistA had a great time at the party , and ProtagonistA even got to dance with the prince . 
ProtagonistA had been travelling west , but ProtagonistA's eyes had been paid to the south , where the sun shone and the air was still and fragrant , the colour of wheat or millet . ProtagonistA had been on the road for days , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and ProtagonistA's back was aching . But ProtagonistA pushed on , drawn by the promise of the sun . Finally , ProtagonistA reached the edge of the forest . ProtagonistA paused for a moment , looking back the way ProtagonistA had come . Then ProtagonistA took a deep breath and stepped out into the sunlight . The first thing ProtagonistA noticed was the warmth . It enveloped ProtagonistA like a blanket , and ProtagonistA sighed in pleasure . The second thing was the smell . The air was heavy with the scent of flowers and trees , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's head begin to swim . ProtagonistA stumbled forward a few steps , and then sank to ProtagonistA's knees . ProtagonistA was dimly aware of voices calling ProtagonistA's name , but ProtagonistA could n't seem to focus on them . Then everything went black . 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends had just finished taking a trip with Rarity . They had gone to the beach , the park , and even the mall . They had a blast together and ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA had made some new friends . 
ProtagonistB did not ask ProtagonistA to do anything , said ProtagonistC , and it was not a question ProtagonistB had thought about thoroughly , much less questioned . ProtagonistB was simply going about ProtagonistB's day , doing ProtagonistB's chores and minding ProtagonistB's own business , when ProtagonistB suddenly had the urge to ask ProtagonistA to help ProtagonistB with something . It was a small thing , really , but ProtagonistC could tell that it meant a lot to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA hesitated at first , unsure if ProtagonistA wanted to help or not , but ProtagonistC could see the love and appreciation in ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistC knew that ProtagonistC could n't say no , so ProtagonistC agreed . It did n't take long for ProtagonistA to realize that helping ProtagonistB was one of the best things ProtagonistA could have ever done . Not only did ProtagonistA feel good about ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA also felt closer to ProtagonistB than ever before . It was a beautiful moment that they shared , and ProtagonistA will always cherish it . 
When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was so excited ProtagonistA had barely remembered what had happened the night before . ProtagonistA had been to the best party ever , and ProtagonistA was just about to go to bed when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's phone at the club . ProtagonistA was so upset that ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's phone , and ProtagonistA was even more upset when ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's purse at the club as well . ProtagonistA was so upset that ProtagonistA decided to go back to the club to look for ProtagonistA's phone and ProtagonistA's purse . When ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's purse , but ProtagonistA could n't find ProtagonistA's phone . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA's phone , and ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had seen it , but ProtagonistB did n't know where it was . ProtagonistA was so upset that ProtagonistA decided to go home . When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA went to bed , and ProtagonistA was so tired that ProtagonistA fell asleep . 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA could hear the water moving up from the lake . It was a soft , gentle sound that made ProtagonistA feel at peace . ProtagonistA sat down on the bank and watched the sun set behind the trees . The colors were so beautiful , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let the sound of the water lull ProtagonistA to sleep . 
ProtagonistA had been so anxious for ProtagonistB to take ProtagonistA's first flight ProtagonistA had not known until that moment that the spell they were about to cast was for something else altogether . ProtagonistA had been so excited to finally be able to experience what it was like to fly and see the world from above . But as ProtagonistA stood there , ready to take off , ProtagonistA realized that this was not what ProtagonistB had meant at all . ProtagonistB had been trying to warn ProtagonistA , to tell ProtagonistA that they were about to cast a spell that would take them to a different world entirely . But ProtagonistA had been so caught up in ProtagonistA's own excitement that ProtagonistA had n't heard ProtagonistB . And now it was too late . ProtagonistA could feel the magic taking hold of ProtagonistA , pulling ProtagonistA into the unknown . ProtagonistA did n't know what to expect , but ProtagonistA knew that whatever was waiting for ProtagonistA , it would be an adventure . 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who had recently lost ProtagonistA's husband . ProtagonistA was grieving and wanted to get away from everything . ProtagonistA heard about a place called New - Heaven and decided to go there . It was a faraway island of the northern seas . It was a world of quiet and calm seas . There were no storms and the weather was always fair . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could start over again in this place . ProtagonistA settled down in a secluded laird 's house . ProtagonistA started to make friends and soon became a part of the community . ProtagonistA started a new life in New - Heaven and was happy there . 
ProtagonistB watched as ProtagonistA twisted and turned , ProtagonistA's hooves shifting as ProtagonistA tried to keep the position . It was a difficult feat , but ProtagonistA was determined to succeed . ProtagonistA had been practicing for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to get the hang of it . As ProtagonistB watched , ProtagonistB felt a sense of pride welling up inside of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's best friend , and ProtagonistB was so proud of ProtagonistA for never giving up . ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA would be a great dancer one day . 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the rocking chair , ProtagonistB's hooves beneath ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was asleep , ProtagonistB's head resting on ProtagonistA's lap . ProtagonistA rocked gently back and forth , a content expression on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA looked down at ProtagonistB , a soft smile on ProtagonistA's lips . It was times like these that ProtagonistA cherished the most . Just ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB , spending time together in peace and quiet . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would grow up to be a strong , independent mare , but for now ProtagonistA was happy to just sit and enjoy the moment . 
ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's wings for four years when ProtagonistA discovered that ProtagonistA was pregnant . ProtagonistA was overjoyed at the news , but knew that ProtagonistA would have to give up ProtagonistA's dream of flying . ProtagonistA was content , however , to raise ProtagonistA's child and watch it grow . 
ProtagonistA had been wandering the land for years at that point , but it was the first time that ProtagonistA had really felt comfortable . ProtagonistA had been living in the forest for a while , and it was starting to feel like home . ProtagonistA had made friends with the animals , and they would often help ProtagonistA find food and shelter . ProtagonistA was content in the forest , and did n't feel the need to wander anymore . 
ProtagonistA had always been a doll . ProtagonistA was the perfect size , always impeccably dressed , and had a sweet face that never seemed to age . But when ProtagonistA turned six , ProtagonistA began to change . ProtagonistA grew taller and ProtagonistA's features became sharper . ProtagonistA's hair turned from blonde to white and ProtagonistA's eyes became cold and hard . ProtagonistA was still beautiful , but in a frightening way . The other dolls began to fear ProtagonistA and stay away . Even ProtagonistA's owner , who had always loved ProtagonistA , began to feel uneasy around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't mind . ProtagonistA was happy to be the great doll ProtagonistA always knew ProtagonistA was . 
ProtagonistA's hooves were shaking , feeling a little dizzy , when suddenly there was nothing but the light of ProtagonistA's tears and the summer air . It was as if ProtagonistA had been transported to another world , one where ProtagonistA was the only inhabitant . ProtagonistA looked around , taking in the beauty of the place , when ProtagonistA heard a voice .  ProtagonistA ,  it called . ProtagonistA turned to see a beautiful white horse walking towards ProtagonistA .  Follow me ,  the horse said . And so ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA followed the horse to a hill overlooking a valley . In the distance ProtagonistA could see a city , and the horse told ProtagonistA that was where ProtagonistA needed to go .  But how will ProtagonistA get there ?  ProtagonistA asked . The horse looked at ProtagonistA and smiled .  ProtagonistA 'll find a way ,  it said . And with that , the horse disappeared , leaving ProtagonistA alone in the strange world . 
ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way to the big horse show in town . ProtagonistA had been practicing hard and was excited to show off ProtagonistA's skills . ProtagonistB was watching over ProtagonistA's hooves - a delicate balance , ProtagonistA reasoned , between worry and excitement - and Shining Armor was resting on ProtagonistA's shoulder . As they approached the arena , ProtagonistA could see the other horses and riders getting ready . ProtagonistA felt a little nervous but was confident in ProtagonistA's abilities . When it was ProtagonistA's turn to enter the ring , ProtagonistA did so with a smile on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA rode ProtagonistA's horse around the course , jumping over the fences and doing ProtagonistA best to show off ProtagonistA's skills . When ProtagonistA crossed the finish line , ProtagonistA was met with applause from the crowd . ProtagonistA had done it ! ProtagonistA had placed first in the horse show . ProtagonistA was so excited and proud of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and Shining Armor for their support and went off to celebrate ProtagonistA's victory . 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's crew of misfits are just like us . They 're always looking for a new adventure , and they 're never afraid to take risks . They 're also always there for each other , no matter what . Just like us , they 're a family . 
ProtagonistA rested ProtagonistA's forelegs on ProtagonistA's knees , and let out a deep breath . ProtagonistA had been running for what felt like hours , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to tire . ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was or where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving . ProtagonistA had to find a way out of this place . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance . It sounded like someone was coming . ProtagonistA quickly got to ProtagonistA's feet and started running again . ProtagonistA did n't know who or what was after ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't want to find out . ProtagonistA had to find a way out before they caught ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the field of our estate , looking at a photograph of ProtagonistB , with the utmost circumstance of safety . ProtagonistA had been waiting for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had first heard about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been intrigued by the stories , and by the way ProtagonistB had looked in the photographs . Finally , ProtagonistA had been able to track ProtagonistB down , and ProtagonistA had been following ProtagonistB for days . ProtagonistA had been careful to keep ProtagonistA's distance , and to make sure that ProtagonistB never saw ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistA had been able to get close enough to take a few photographs . And now ProtagonistA was sitting in the field , looking at one of those photographs . ProtagonistB was a beautiful woman , with a kind face . ProtagonistA could see the intelligence in ProtagonistB's eyes , and the strength in ProtagonistB's jaw . ProtagonistB was a woman who had been through a lot , and who had come out the other side . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would be able to help ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's own problems . ProtagonistA just had to find a way to get close to ProtagonistB , and to get ProtagonistB to trust ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked out over the moon . It was a beautiful night , and ProtagonistA felt at peace . ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately , and it felt good to just sit and appreciate the simple things in life . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and took a deep breath , letting the calmness wash over ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA looked over the map and saw more animals than ProtagonistA's own family . ProtagonistA looked out onto the world and saw a vast array of different creatures , each with their own unique features and habits . ProtagonistA was amazed at the variety of life on Earth and felt lucky to be a part of it . 
ProtagonistA lived in a small town in northern Syria . ProtagonistA was the only child of ProtagonistA's parents , who were both farmers . ProtagonistA's parents worked hard to provide for their family and their community . They grew crops and raised livestock , and they also hunted and gathered food from the surrounding forest . ProtagonistA helped ProtagonistA's parents with their work , and ProtagonistA also attended school . As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to help ProtagonistA's parents more and more with the farm work . ProtagonistA also started to take on more responsibility for the community . ProtagonistA helped to organize the town 's food distribution , and ProtagonistA also helped to care for the town 's children . As the years passed , ProtagonistA's parents grew older and they began to rely on ProtagonistA more and more . ProtagonistA continued to help ProtagonistA's parents with the farm work , and ProtagonistA also continued to help the community . ProtagonistA became the town 's leader , and ProtagonistA helped to keep the town running smoothly . The townspeople were happy and content , and they loved ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA's parents passed away . ProtagonistA was now the only one who could take care of the farm and the town . ProtagonistA worked hard to keep everything going , but it was difficult . The townspeople helped ProtagonistA as much as they could , but they also had their own families to take care of . ProtagonistA continued to work hard , and ProtagonistA eventually managed to keep the farm and the town running smoothly . ProtagonistA was a good leader , and ProtagonistA was loved by ProtagonistA's people . The townspeople were happy and content , and they continued to live their peaceful lives . 
ProtagonistA had always been a go - getter . ProtagonistA was always the one to start new projects and see them through to the end . But , as ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA started to realize that ProtagonistA was always starting new projects but never finishing them . ProtagonistA would get bored or distracted and move on to something else before ProtagonistA could see the project through . It took ten years for ProtagonistA to realize what ProtagonistA was really up to , but ProtagonistA knew exactly what ProtagonistA needed to do . ProtagonistA needed to find a project that ProtagonistA was passionate about and stick with it until the end . And , that 's exactly what ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA found a cause that ProtagonistA cared deeply about and devoted ProtagonistA's time and energy to it . ProtagonistA became a leader in the movement and made a difference in the world . 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the great grave , ignorant of all the history of the kingdom . ProtagonistA had no intention of ever going back . The only thing ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistA had been sent here by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA did n't know why , but ProtagonistA trusted ProtagonistB . After a while , ProtagonistA got up and dusted ProtagonistA off . ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was in a graveyard . ProtagonistA saw the headstones and remembered ProtagonistB's words .  All the history of the kingdom is buried here .  ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was sitting on the grave of the Queen of Hearts . 
ProtagonistA was so much more beautiful than I thought ProtagonistA was that ProtagonistA was going to kill me . I had seen ProtagonistA around campus , but I never really talked to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always with ProtagonistA's friends and I was always with mine . But one day , I saw ProtagonistA walking by ProtagonistA and I decided to talk to ProtagonistA . We hit it off immediately and started dating . But I soon realized that ProtagonistA was different than I thought ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA was always talking about how ProtagonistA was better than everyone else and how ProtagonistA deserved the best of everything . I tried to break up with ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA threatened to kill me if I ever left ProtagonistA . I was scared and did n't know what to do . But one day , I mustered up the courage to leave ProtagonistA . I have n't seen ProtagonistA since and I hope I never will again . 
ProtagonistA sat on the grass , ProtagonistA's wings spread , ProtagonistA's ears perked up as ProtagonistA listened to the rustle of leaves outside ProtagonistA's window . It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was enjoying the sunshine . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let the warmth wash over ProtagonistA . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise that sounded like someone was coming . ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw a large rabbit walking towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was so startled that ProtagonistA flew into the air . The rabbit stopped and watched ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA flew away . 
ProtagonistA's eyes were glassy and ProtagonistA's brain had no thoughts . ProtagonistA was in a coma , lying in a hospital bed . ProtagonistA's family was gathered around ProtagonistA , waiting for ProtagonistA to wake up . They had been told that ProtagonistA might never wake up , but they refused to give up hope . Every day , they would talk to ProtagonistA , telling ProtagonistA about their day and what was going on in the world . They would hold ProtagonistA's hand and tell ProtagonistA that they loved ProtagonistA . And every day , they would pray for a miracle . One day , after months of waiting , ProtagonistA's eyes fluttered open . ProtagonistA's family was gathered around ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could see the relief in their eyes . ProtagonistA was weak , but ProtagonistA was alive . ProtagonistA tried to speak , but ProtagonistA's voice was hoarse . ProtagonistA's family leaned in , eager to hear ProtagonistA's first words . ProtagonistA love you ,  ProtagonistA croaked . They all broke down in tears , hugging ProtagonistA and each other . It was a miracle . ProtagonistA was alive , and ProtagonistA was going to be okay . 
I am a destitute orphan living in a time of dire need , reduced to a mere child by ProtagonistA . My parents died when I was young , leaving me all alone in the world . I was taken in by ProtagonistA . However , times have been tough lately and ProtagonistA has been forced to take in other orphans to make ends meet . I now find myself living in a cramped house with several other children , all of us struggling to get by . We are constantly cold and hungry , as ProtagonistA can barely afford to feed us all , let alone keep the house warm . I often go to bed with a growling stomach , dreaming of the day when I can finally leave this place and make something of myself . One day , I know I 'll escape this life of poverty and make something of myself . But for now , I am just a destitute orphan , living in a time of dire need . 
ProtagonistB watched as ProtagonistA twisted and turned , ProtagonistA's hooves shifting as ProtagonistA tried to keep the position . ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was trying to find the perfect spot to lie down , but it just was n't happening . ProtagonistB felt bad for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB also knew that there was nothing ProtagonistB could do . ProtagonistB just had to wait it out and hope that ProtagonistA would eventually find a comfortable spot . 
Some years ago , I went to see ProtagonistA ; but that name had quite a curious meaning to me , as I had been accustomed to hear ProtagonistA use it when I went into a room where ProtagonistA lived with ProtagonistA's friends and relatives . I had never seen ProtagonistA before , and I was very much surprised when ProtagonistA came to the door and asked me my name . I told ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA seemed very much pleased . ProtagonistA asked me to come in , and I did so . The room was full of people , and they all stared at me . I felt very awkward , and wished I had not come . ProtagonistA introduced me to ProtagonistA's friends , and they all shook hands with me . I was very glad when ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA would take me home . 
ProtagonistA's family had never been a particularly close one . ProtagonistA's parents had always been wrapped up in their own lives and their own problems and never had much time for ProtagonistA . As a result , ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner . ProtagonistA was content to spend ProtagonistA's days reading books and exploring the woods around ProtagonistA's house . The house where ProtagonistA had lived with ProtagonistA's family had stood empty from the start . It was a large , rambling old house that had been in ProtagonistA's family for generations . When ProtagonistA's parents died , ProtagonistA was the only one left and ProtagonistA had no desire to keep up the old place . So , ProtagonistA sold it and moved away . For years , the house stood empty , slowly falling into disrepair . The once beautiful gardens were overgrown and the windows were boarded up . It was a sad sight . But then , one day , a family moved in . They were a young couple with two small children . They fell in love with the house at first sight and set about restoring it to its former glory . ProtagonistA sometimes drives by the house now and ProtagonistA ca n't help but feel a sense of pride and happiness when ProtagonistA sees it . It 's like seeing a part of ProtagonistA's childhood come back to life . 
ProtagonistA had been a human being , and a man , and had been of every human class and race . ProtagonistA had been of one kind of body or another , and had possessed more or less of two or three kinds of intelligence . ProtagonistA had been distinguished from ProtagonistA's fellows by some characteristic quality peculiar to the particular kind of river , stream , or other watercourse by which ProtagonistA had been obtained . However , ProtagonistA had been the object of abhorrent or even loathsome detestable treatment , and had been either tortured or executed for the crime of attempting to escape from the jurisdiction of any superior authority . ProtagonistA had been unwilling either to help ProtagonistA's persecutors or to defend ProtagonistA , and had been willing to do anything to prevent ProtagonistA's persecutors from killing or setting out to kill ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had believed ProtagonistA to be innocent , and no less a judge or magistrate than a criminal had charged ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the edge of a tarpaulin in a crowded room with the windows down when the voice whispered in ProtagonistA's ear .  I can see ProtagonistA's future , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 're going to be a great success . ProtagonistA turned to see who had spoken , but there was no one there . ProtagonistA turned back to the tarpaulin and continued to sit there , wondering what the voice had meant . A few weeks later , ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's office when ProtagonistA received a call from a friend .  I just wanted to let ProtagonistA know that I saw ProtagonistA's future , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 're going to be a great success . ProtagonistA was surprised , but pleased , to hear this . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistA's friend and hung up the phone , feeling more confident than ever before . Since that day , ProtagonistA has gone on to achieve great things . ProtagonistA attributes ProtagonistA's success to the voice that whispered in ProtagonistA's ear all those years ago . 
ProtagonistA was born as the son of a salaried workman in the midst of a profusion of pre - war industries of industrial importance , and who , having hung on throughout a highly successful career , has made ProtagonistA's fortune by , and in fact made ProtagonistA's fortune quite a while ago , by the methods which ProtagonistA has adopted to capitalize upon ProtagonistA's great fortune , although of late the conflict of interest which ProtagonistB enjoyed , in procuring a certain amount of capital , has become a serious matter ProtagonistA was always a bright child , and ProtagonistA quickly learned how to capitalize on ProtagonistA's strengths . ProtagonistA was very good at making friends and networking , and ProtagonistA quickly learned how to use ProtagonistA's charms to get what ProtagonistA wanted . ProtagonistA was also very good at making money , and ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA could use ProtagonistA's money to get ahead in life . ProtagonistB was always very supportive of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA to get started in ProtagonistA's career . However , ProtagonistB was also very interested in making money , and ProtagonistB often used ProtagonistB's position to get ProtagonistA's help in making money . This conflict of interest eventually became a serious problem , and it caused a lot of tension between ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA is now a very successful woman , and ProtagonistA has made a fortune by using ProtagonistA's unique talents . However , ProtagonistA is still haunted by the conflict of interest with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA is often left wondering if ProtagonistA could have done more with ProtagonistA's life if ProtagonistA had not been so focused on making money . 
There was ProtagonistA in the full light of the morning , and ProtagonistA was very tired . ProtagonistA had been up all night , trying to finish ProtagonistA's homework , and ProtagonistA was just about to give up and go to bed when ProtagonistA heard a noise outside . It sounded like someone was crying . ProtagonistA went to the window and saw ProtagonistB sitting on the curb , crying ProtagonistB's eyes out . ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB had been there for a while . ProtagonistA felt bad for ProtagonistB , so ProtagonistA went outside to see if ProtagonistA could help . When ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistB was crying because ProtagonistB had lost ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistC's name was , and ProtagonistB said it was Mr. Whiskers . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistB did . They looked all around the neighborhood , but they could n't find ProtagonistC . Just when they were about to give up , ProtagonistA heard a meow coming from a tree . ProtagonistA climbed up the tree , and there was ProtagonistC , stuck in a branch . ProtagonistA got ProtagonistC down , and ProtagonistB was so happy to have ProtagonistC back . ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a big hug and went on ProtagonistB's way . ProtagonistA went back inside , and ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA had helped ProtagonistB . It made ProtagonistA feel good to know that ProtagonistA had made someone 's day a little bit better . 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was the only unicorn in the world . ProtagonistA was wrong . There were others like ProtagonistA , but they were all hidden away . ProtagonistA was different . ProtagonistA was special . ProtagonistA was the only one who could see the magic in the world . When ProtagonistA found out about the others , ProtagonistA was scared at first . But then ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was not alone . ProtagonistA had a community of unicorns who loved and accepted ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had never known that ProtagonistB did n't like ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had always thought that ProtagonistB was just a grumpy old man who did n't want to be bothered with ProtagonistA . But one day , ProtagonistA overheard ProtagonistB talking to ProtagonistA's mother .  ProtagonistB do n't know why you put up with ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA 's always been a troublemaker .  ProtagonistA's mother just sighed and said ,  ProtagonistA 's our daughter , and we love ProtagonistA .  After that , ProtagonistA tried to be a better daughter , but ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was being compared to ProtagonistA's siblings and found wanting . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bright girl , but something had been off lately . ProtagonistA had been feeling more and more disconnected from the world around ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA just could n't seem to shake it . So , when ProtagonistA had the opportunity to kill ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA took it . ProtagonistA did n't want to live anymore . However , when ProtagonistA tried to kill ProtagonistA , something strange happened . ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden , surrounded by friendly creatures . ProtagonistA had never felt so alive before . In that moment , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been wrong about suicide ; it was n't the answer . ProtagonistA decided to live for ProtagonistA from then on and ProtagonistA was never happier . 
ProtagonistA had heard the talk of a great city , but ProtagonistA had never seen any of it . ProtagonistA had always lived in the country , and it was all ProtagonistA had ever known . But one day , ProtagonistA decided to take a trip into the city . ProtagonistA was amazed by all of the sights and sounds . ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it . ProtagonistA walked the streets for hours , taking it all in . ProtagonistA even got to see the city at night , when it was all lit up . It was an experience ProtagonistA would never forget . 
ProtagonistA was driving to work when ProtagonistA was hit by another car . ProtagonistA was rushed to the hospital and was in a coma for weeks . When ProtagonistA finally woke up , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been in an accident . ProtagonistA was grateful to be alive but was also angry that ProtagonistA had been in an accident . ProtagonistA was determined to make the most of ProtagonistA's life from that day forward . 
When ProtagonistA was ten , ProtagonistA was invited to a party . It was a big party , and ProtagonistA was excited to go . ProtagonistA had never been to a party before , and ProtagonistA was curious about what would happen . ProtagonistA was a little bit nervous , but ProtagonistA was also excited . At the party , ProtagonistA met a lot of new people . ProtagonistA danced , ProtagonistA laughed , and ProtagonistA had a great time . ProtagonistA was surprised at how much fun ProtagonistA had , and ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had gone to the party . When ProtagonistA was fourteen , ProtagonistA was invited to another party . This time , ProtagonistA was a little bit more experienced , and ProtagonistA knew what to expect . ProtagonistA had a great time , and ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had gone . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a recluse , preferring to stay in ProtagonistA's workshop tinkering with ProtagonistA's latest invention rather than spend time with ProtagonistA's family . So , when ProtagonistB found out that ProtagonistA had been cheating on ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB was not surprised . What did surprise ProtagonistB was the lengths ProtagonistA went to keep ProtagonistA's affair a secret . ProtagonistA had been cheating on ProtagonistC with ProtagonistC's best friend . When ProtagonistB found out , ProtagonistB was devastated . ProtagonistB confronted ProtagonistA and demanded to know why ProtagonistA had done this to ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA's only response was that ProtagonistA was  in love  with ProtagonistB's friend . ProtagonistB was so angry that ProtagonistB tore ProtagonistA's arm off . ProtagonistB did n't even care that ProtagonistA was screaming in pain . All ProtagonistB cared about was the pain ProtagonistC was going through . ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistC would never be able to forgive ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB did n't blame ProtagonistC . As far as ProtagonistB was concerned , ProtagonistA was dead to ProtagonistB . 
The world is over . That 's what ProtagonistA thought as ProtagonistA was thrown out of the castle into the wilds of October . ProtagonistA had been murdered , and ProtagonistA had been hoping to be rid of ProtagonistA for a hundred years . But now , ProtagonistA was back , and ProtagonistA was facing the thing that had killed ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't stand a chance . 
ProtagonistA had been taking the ferry down the winding stone steps into the harbor for years . ProtagonistA had never missed a day . But today , something was different . ProtagonistA could n't seem to get up . ProtagonistB , came over to ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA , please get up ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB ca n't leave without ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA tried to stand , but ProtagonistA's legs would n't work . ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA up and took ProtagonistA to the ferry . ProtagonistB sat ProtagonistA down and gave ProtagonistA a blanket .  What 's wrong , ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked .  ProtagonistA 've never been late before .  ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA did n't know what was wrong . ProtagonistA had been feeling tired lately , but ProtagonistA thought it was just because ProtagonistA was getting old . Now ProtagonistA was n't so sure . ProtagonistB stayed with ProtagonistA until the ferry arrived at the other side . Then ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA off and took ProtagonistA to the doctor . 
ProtagonistA watched in horror as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB die . ProtagonistA had seen death before , but never like this . ProtagonistB was being killed in cold blood , right in front of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could n't just stand by and watch . ProtagonistA had to do something . 
ProtagonistA was a man of the people , and at the time that ProtagonistA was travelling so very far , that ProtagonistA was not aware of its importance . ProtagonistA was on a journey to find ProtagonistA , and in doing so , ProtagonistA found something much greater . ProtagonistA found a purpose . Along the way , ProtagonistA made many friends and helped many people . ProtagonistA was a light in their lives , and they were a light in ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA showed them that it was possible to be happy and to live a good life , no matter what their circumstances were . And in return , they showed ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was not alone . They were with ProtagonistA , always . 
ProtagonistA was imprisoned no less than twenty - seven times on the Disc of the Dead , and it has been since then that ProtagonistA has been allowed a solitary passage out of ProtagonistA's cell . ProtagonistA has been a prisoner for so long that the outside world has become a distant memory . The only thing that keeps ProtagonistA going is the hope that one day ProtagonistA will be able to escape and see the world again . One day , after years of waiting , ProtagonistA's chance finally comes . The guards leave ProtagonistA's cell unlocked and ProtagonistA takes ProtagonistA's opportunity to run . ProtagonistA does n't know where ProtagonistA is going , but ProtagonistA does n't care . All that matters is that ProtagonistA is free . ProtagonistA runs and runs until ProtagonistA reaches the edge of the Disc . ProtagonistA looks down at the infinite void below and knows that there is no turning back now . ProtagonistA takes a deep breath and jumps . For a moment ProtagonistA feels weightless , free from all ProtagonistA's troubles . But then ProtagonistA starts to fall and the reality of ProtagonistA's situation sets in . ProtagonistA screams as ProtagonistA plummets into the darkness , knowing that ProtagonistA will never escape the Disc of the Dead . 
ProtagonistA was never one for following the rules . ProtagonistA was always pushing boundaries and testing limits . By the time ProtagonistA reached ProtagonistA's limits , ProtagonistA was an ordinary young man -- not quite fourteen , but in the right sort of body . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider and did n't quite fit in with the other girls ProtagonistA's age . But that did n't stop ProtagonistA from living ProtagonistA's life to the fullest . ProtagonistA was always pushing ProtagonistA to try new things and experience as much as ProtagonistA could . And ProtagonistA loved every minute of it . Even though ProtagonistA was now a young man , ProtagonistA still did n't feel like ProtagonistA fit in anywhere . But ProtagonistA was content with who ProtagonistA was and did n't want to change a thing . ProtagonistA was happy living life on ProtagonistA's own terms and would n't have it any other way . 
In the year 1838 , ProtagonistA published ProtagonistA's scientific treatise , entitled Energetic Forces and Energy , in which ProtagonistA distinguishes between the forms of energy , invisible to the senses , and those which have a definite object , the third and highest form of Energy . ProtagonistA argues that the highest form of energy is that which is used to create and maintain life , and that this energy is best harnessed through the use of reason and scientific knowledge . 
ProtagonistA had been married for years , but ProtagonistA still felt like a newlywed . ProtagonistA loved spending time with ProtagonistA's wife , even if it was just doing mundane tasks like picking up the newspaper . After ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's wife alone in the garden , ProtagonistA went to pick up the newspaper and dipped it into ProtagonistA's cupboard , wishing ProtagonistA had a camera and a memory of where ProtagonistA had put it the week before . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget the moments ProtagonistA shared with ProtagonistA's wife , even if ProtagonistA could n't always remember where ProtagonistA left the newspaper . 
ProtagonistA usually sat at ProtagonistA's desk and wrote in a notebook . ProtagonistA was a writer and loved to write stories . Today , ProtagonistA was working on a new story about a girl who lived in a magical kingdom . The girl was going on a quest to find a lost treasure . ProtagonistA was just about to write the part where the girl found the treasure , when ProtagonistA heard a noise outside ProtagonistA's window . ProtagonistA got up to see what it was and saw a bird flying by . ProtagonistA watched the bird for a few minutes before going back to ProtagonistA's story . 
ProtagonistB would n't trust ProtagonistA , if only ProtagonistA were real . ProtagonistB 'd give ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's tongue , said the gleam of ProtagonistA's unicorn horn in ProtagonistB's pearly paling eyes . ProtagonistB had been following ProtagonistA for hours , it seemed , and ProtagonistB was getting tired . ProtagonistB had been so excited when ProtagonistB first saw ProtagonistA jump down the rabbit hole . ProtagonistB was sure that this was an adventure ProtagonistB would never forget . But now , ProtagonistB was n't so sure . ProtagonistA had led ProtagonistB to a strange place . There was a big house , and ProtagonistA had gone inside . ProtagonistB had tried to follow , but the door had slammed shut in ProtagonistB's face . ProtagonistB had been trying to find a way in ever since . ProtagonistB was just about to give up when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA again . ProtagonistA was sitting on a large mushroom , eating a carrot . ProtagonistB approached cautiously . ProtagonistB was n't sure if ProtagonistB could trust ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB was curious . ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  Where have ProtagonistA been ? ProtagonistB 've been looking for ProtagonistA . The rabbit did n't answer . ProtagonistA just continued to eat ProtagonistA's carrot . ProtagonistA , please ,  ProtagonistB begged .  ProtagonistB 'm lost . ProtagonistB do n't know where ProtagonistB am . Again , ProtagonistA said nothing . ProtagonistB was getting frustrated . ProtagonistB was about to give up when ProtagonistB saw the gleam in ProtagonistA's eye . It was the same gleam ProtagonistB had seen in the unicorn horn . ProtagonistA , if ProtagonistA 're real , then help ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB do n't know where ProtagonistB am . The rabbit hopped off the mushroom and led ProtagonistB to a door . ProtagonistA opened the door and motioned for ProtagonistB to go inside . ProtagonistB hesitated . ProtagonistB did n't know if ProtagonistB could trust ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistB was tired and lost , and ProtagonistB did n't know what else to do . ProtagonistB took a deep breath and stepped through the door . 
Slow , steady , and thoughtful , the moment ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's seat at the table , Equestrians moved through the dark and the undulating hall of the palace , picking vixens and lasses out of the crowd and casting them away to dance with the three most beautiful sisters of the Siras Academy . ProtagonistA , feeling a sudden warmth in ProtagonistA's cheeks , turned ProtagonistA's head away from the Equestrians . ProtagonistA caught the eye of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had a kind face and a warm smile , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart flutter in ProtagonistA's chest . The music started up , a slow , sensual melody that made ProtagonistA's skin prick with goosebumps . The Equestrians began to move , their hips undulating in time with the music . ProtagonistA watched , entranced , as they moved around the room , their bodies graceful and powerful . Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt a hand on ProtagonistA's shoulder , and ProtagonistA was being pulled to ProtagonistA's feet . ProtagonistA looked up into the eyes of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA's hand and led ProtagonistA onto the dance floor . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream as ProtagonistA was swept up in the music and the movement . ProtagonistA was lost in the moment , and ProtagonistA did n't want it to end . 
The House of Parliament , in the house of the Lords , had passed an act , which ProtagonistA expressly reserved to ProtagonistA , for a certain purposes , and without any previous consent of ProtagonistA , which provided , that the title of ProtagonistA , for the whole period that ProtagonistA was under the age of eighteen years , should be , and was hereby , vested in the Crown . ProtagonistA was furious when ProtagonistA found out . ProtagonistA felt that ProtagonistA's rights had been violated and that the act was unjust . ProtagonistA was determined to fight it and to get ProtagonistA's title back . ProtagonistA started a petition and gathered signatures from all over the country . ProtagonistA went to the House of Lords and made ProtagonistA's case . ProtagonistA was eloquent and persuasive , and the Lords listened . In the end , they overturned the act and restored ProtagonistA's title to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was triumphant and vindicated . ProtagonistA had shown that ProtagonistA was not to be pushed around or denied ProtagonistA's rights . ProtagonistA was a force to be reckoned with , and ProtagonistA would never give up fighting for what was rightfully ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was walking home from ProtagonistA's friend 's house when ProtagonistA was jumped from behind . ProtagonistA felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's throat and then ProtagonistA's vision started to fade . As ProtagonistA lay on the ground , ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistA's attacker standing over ProtagonistA , knife in hand . ProtagonistA's heart was pounding in ProtagonistA's chest and ProtagonistA could feel the warm blood running down ProtagonistA's throat . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die . ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistA's family and friends and how much ProtagonistA was going to miss them . Then everything went black . 
It was a cold , winter morning and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were walking to school . ProtagonistB was carrying ProtagonistA's heavy backpack for ProtagonistA . They were two blocks from the school door and three blocks from the flat that always seemed to be the last place to put ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA went to sleep . ProtagonistB was tired and ProtagonistA's daughter could see it in ProtagonistB's eyes .  ProtagonistB , can ProtagonistA walk the rest of the way by ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistA asked .  ProtagonistB think ProtagonistA should ,  ProtagonistB replied . So ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's backpack and continued on to school by ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was cold , but ProtagonistA felt good walking on ProtagonistA's own . 
ProtagonistA had been a church member for years , but ProtagonistA had never really felt connected to ProtagonistA's fellow parishioners . ProtagonistA always felt like an outsider , like ProtagonistA was just going through the motions . But then , one day , ProtagonistA had a conversation with one of ProtagonistA's fellow church members that changed everything . They were discussing ProtagonistA's ministry and how ProtagonistA was helping people through ProtagonistA's work at the temple . The other woman told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was doing God 's work , and that ProtagonistA was making a difference in the world . ProtagonistA was surprised to hear this , and it made ProtagonistA feel good . For the first time , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA belonged . ProtagonistA started to feel more connected to ProtagonistA's church community and to the people ProtagonistA was helping . This experience made ProtagonistA realize that ProtagonistA had been suppressing ProtagonistA's own sense of history . ProtagonistA had been forgetting or ignoring the fact that ProtagonistA was part of something larger than ProtagonistA . But now ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA's work was important , and that ProtagonistA was making a difference . 
ProtagonistA was staring up at the sky , ProtagonistA's eyes wide in wonder . ProtagonistA pointed up at a bright light and said to the sailors of the Thames ,  ProtagonistA 've got a comet !  The sailors all looked up and saw the comet , too . They started to make wishes on it , and ProtagonistA wished for a great adventure . 
ProtagonistA's family was devastated when ProtagonistA was killed . ProtagonistA was the breadwinner and the glue that held the family together . ProtagonistA's six daughters were left to fend for themselves . Two of ProtagonistA's daughters were known to the world , and two were known only to ProtagonistA's friends and family . The girls were lost without ProtagonistA . They struggled to make ends meet and to find their place in the world . But they did it , together . And they knew that ProtagonistA would be proud of them . 
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA saw a light up ahead . ProtagonistA walked towards it and saw that it was a lamp on a small table . ProtagonistA picked it up and looked around . ProtagonistA saw a door in the tree and a key on the table . ProtagonistA put the key in the door and turned it . The door opened and ProtagonistA walked through . ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden . The flowers were glittering with the colors of magic . ProtagonistA blinked widely , as though ProtagonistA were trying to find the light . ProtagonistA walked around the garden and saw a castle in the distance . ProtagonistA started to walk towards it , but ProtagonistA was suddenly pulled back . ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB standing there . ProtagonistB was holding a lantern and ProtagonistB looked very old .  Who are ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked .  ProtagonistB am the keeper of this garden ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB have been waiting for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB have been waiting for a very long time .  
ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was afraid of ghosts . ProtagonistA had seen too many movies where the protagonist is haunted by a ghost and ProtagonistA did n't want that to be ProtagonistA's fate . However , one day , ProtagonistA saw a ghost in ProtagonistA's house . At first , ProtagonistA was scared . But then ProtagonistA realized that the ghost was just a figment of ProtagonistA's imagination and ProtagonistA was n't really scared anymore . 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who lived in a small town . ProtagonistA was a simple girl who worked hard and did n't have much . One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the woods when ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was very old and looked like ProtagonistB was about to die . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was the Emperor of the Day , and according to the law of physics , ProtagonistB was going to die in the year 5802 . ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA the title of Emperor , and this made ProtagonistA powerful . ProtagonistA was now able to make deals with anyone ProtagonistA wanted . ProtagonistA quickly became the most powerful person in the world . 
ProtagonistA was walking home from the back of the church , where ProtagonistA had been having a rough passage due to ProtagonistA , and which was in ProtagonistA's own shoes , with ProtagonistA's hat on . ProtagonistA was thinking about the events of the day and how ProtagonistA could have handled them better . ProtagonistA was also thinking about the future and what ProtagonistA wanted to do with ProtagonistA's life . As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB walking in front of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase . ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was going somewhere important . ProtagonistA wondered what ProtagonistB did for a living . ProtagonistA also wondered if ProtagonistB had ever had a rough passage in ProtagonistB's life . 
I first met ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA was nineteen years old and ProtagonistA was working as a dressmaker in the East End of London . I was immediately struck by ProtagonistA's beauty and ProtagonistA's kindness . We became friends quickly , and I soon learned that ProtagonistA was one of the most talented dressmakers in the city . ProtagonistA could make any dress look beautiful , no matter how simple it was . ProtagonistA was also a very compassionate person . ProtagonistA was always helping others , whether it was making them a new dress or just lending a listening ear . ProtagonistA was always there for me when I needed ProtagonistA , and I will never forget ProtagonistA's kindness . Sadly , ProtagonistA passed away last year . But , even though ProtagonistA is gone , ProtagonistA's memory continues to live on in the hearts of those who knew ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had been aboard the Carol when it collided with the moor . ProtagonistA saw a large ship covered in splinters and thought it possible the corpse of a man might have come aboard . However , it was clear the man had been murdered in some strange way . 
ProtagonistB had been battling ovarian cancer for years , and ProtagonistA had been by ProtagonistB's side every step of the way . But the cancer had finally taken ProtagonistB's life , and ProtagonistA was left feeling lost and alone . The night after ProtagonistB's death , ProtagonistA spent the night in a hospital room with a needle in ProtagonistA's arm and a tube in ProtagonistA's leg . And it was during that night that ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's first dream . In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing in a field of flowers . ProtagonistB was smiling and ProtagonistB looked happy and at peace . ProtagonistA woke up from ProtagonistA's dream feeling comforted and hopeful . Even though ProtagonistB was gone , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was still with ProtagonistB in spirit . 
ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA back on the landscape and ProtagonistB said ,  That 's it , then . ProtagonistA 's free , though ProtagonistA doubts it . Even an assassination attempt in the capital would be unlikely . Oh , ProtagonistB know it 's a bad idea . ProtagonistA was at a party once . ProtagonistA sighed and shook ProtagonistA's head .  ProtagonistA do n't know , ProtagonistB . It just seems so final , you know ? Like ProtagonistA 'm giving up on everything . ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 're not giving up on anything . ProtagonistA 're just moving on to the next phase of ProtagonistA's life . And besides , ProtagonistA know it 's the right thing to do . ProtagonistA 've been talking about it for months now . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was right , but ProtagonistA still could n't help but feel a little sad as ProtagonistA turned away from ProtagonistA's home of the last ten years . ProtagonistA had loved living in the city , but it was time for a change . And ProtagonistA was ready for the next adventure . 
It is a month of extreme hardship for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA can not possibly be surprised by the scene which I have set before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB's body is lying in state in the great hall of the castle , and ProtagonistA is weeping over it . All of ProtagonistB's belongings have been taken away , and ProtagonistA is the only one who has been left to mourn ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA is not surprised by the scene , but ProtagonistA is saddened by it . 
ProtagonistA had always been good at cards . ProtagonistA could remember back to when ProtagonistA was a little girl , sitting at the kitchen table with ProtagonistA's mother and father , playing Go Fish and War . ProtagonistA had always had a knack for reading people and knowing what cards they were holding . As ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA could use ProtagonistA's skills to make money . So , some time in the latter half of the eighteenth century , ProtagonistA set out to steal the title of Ruben de Vros , notwithstanding the great advantages which ProtagonistA had acquired by ProtagonistA's skill in the art of card - playing . ProtagonistA went to the best casinos in Europe and cleaned them out , one by one . The owners of the casinos got wind of who ProtagonistA was and started banning ProtagonistA from their establishments . But ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA was on a roll and nothing was going to stop ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA started playing in underground games , where the stakes were higher and the players were more desperate . ProtagonistA won more money than ProtagonistA knew what to do with and rubbed elbows with the criminal underworld . But ProtagonistA's luck eventually ran out . One night , ProtagonistA was playing in a high - stakes game with some of the most dangerous people in the world . ProtagonistA lost everything ProtagonistA had and then some . Desperate and broke , ProtagonistA made a deal with ProtagonistB to give ProtagonistB information on other card players in exchange for money . It was a slippery slope from there . ProtagonistA became a professional gambler and a con artist , using ProtagonistA's skills to take advantage of other people . ProtagonistA ruined lives and ruined ProtagonistA in the process . ProtagonistA ended up alone and penniless , ProtagonistA's once - great skills nothing but a memory . 
At least Alice was n't going to eat them , said ProtagonistA — fully aware that ProtagonistA was packing a bag full of the pastries in case ProtagonistA ran into an unusual custom in the future , and in anticipation of Croaking to find a new friend to eat with . ProtagonistA had been warned about the customs of the land , and was not about to take any chances . Even so , ProtagonistA could not help but be curious about the Croaking , and was excited to see what would happen . 
ProtagonistA had been on the City - Ship for as long as ProtagonistA could remember . It was ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA's life . But now , ProtagonistA was stepping out into the unknown . ProtagonistA's left arm crossed over ProtagonistA's chest , as though ProtagonistA were about to slide into oblivion . But ProtagonistA was n't . ProtagonistA was stepping out into the world for the first time . And ProtagonistA was scared . But ProtagonistA was also excited . ProtagonistA did n't know what was out there , but ProtagonistA was ready to find out . 
ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately . First , ProtagonistA had gotten sick and had to be hospitalized . Then , ProtagonistA was released and had to recover at home . Finally , ProtagonistA was starting to feel better and was able to go outside again . However , on the ninth day , ProtagonistA began to feel worse again . ProtagonistA had a fever and felt very weak . ProtagonistA began to worry that ProtagonistA would never get better .

ProtagonistA , sitting crosslegged on a damp stone floor , had a cigarette lighter in each hand , and a bundle of twigs in front of ProtagonistA , containing nothing but a wide - brimmed hat and a pair of straw gloves . ProtagonistA was trying to light a fire , but the dampness of the twigs made it difficult . ProtagonistA had been at it for hours , and ProtagonistA's fingers were getting sore from holding the lighters . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw a spark catch on one of the twigs . ProtagonistA quickly cupped ProtagonistA's hands around it to shelter it from the damp air , and soon a small fire was burning . ProtagonistA added some of the larger twigs to the fire , and then sat back to warm ProtagonistA's hands . ProtagonistA was so focused on the fire that ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching until they were right behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistB standing there , watching ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't know how long ProtagonistB had been there , but ProtagonistA did n't feel scared .

When ProtagonistA was thirteen years old , ProtagonistA dated ProtagonistA's first book , In a Sentence or an Exposition , for something like three months , noting the date , and so casting some doubt . It was a nice enough book , but ProtagonistA did n't really understand it and ProtagonistA got bored quickly . ProtagonistA was relieved when it was over and ProtagonistA could move on to something else . 
In the year of our Lord 2001 , ProtagonistA was sitting in the chair , with ProtagonistA's hat on the mantelpiece , and ProtagonistB next to ProtagonistA , which was a very strange arrangement . ProtagonistB had a top hat of ProtagonistB's own , which ProtagonistB was holding in ProtagonistB's hands . ProtagonistB was looking at ProtagonistA with a strange expression on ProtagonistB's face . What are ProtagonistB looking at ?  ProtagonistA asked . I'm looking at ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA 're a very strange woman . And ProtagonistB 're a very strange man ,  ProtagonistA said .  Why are ProtagonistB here?I'm here to help ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA 're in a lot of trouble . What kind of trouble ?  ProtagonistA asked . You're in danger ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA need to leave this place . Why ?  ProtagonistA asked .  What 's going to happen to me?I ca n't tell ProtagonistA that ,  ProtagonistB said .  But ProtagonistA need to trust ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA need to come with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment . ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA could trust ProtagonistB . But then ProtagonistA thought about all the trouble ProtagonistA was in . ProtagonistA was in danger . ProtagonistA needed to leave . ProtagonistA stood up and followed ProtagonistB out of the house . ProtagonistA did n't know what was going to happen , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to trust ProtagonistB . 
 Well ProtagonistB 've done well indeed ,  said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA sat down next to ProtagonistB , looking up at the heavens above them with a kind of dislike and a kind of curiosity .  ProtagonistB 've managed to find the only spot on this entire planet that is n't covered in pollution . I know ,  said ProtagonistB ,  but it was n't easy . It took ProtagonistB years to find this place . And now that ProtagonistB have , what are ProtagonistB going to do with it?I'm going to live here ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'm going to build a house and live off the land . You're going to be lonely ,  ProtagonistA said . No , ProtagonistB 'm not ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'm going to be happy .  
ProtagonistA was a remarkable woman . ProtagonistA was born in the year of King Henry I 's coronation and ProtagonistA made a huge contribution to the prosperity of London during ProtagonistA's 16 years there . ProtagonistA was so devoted to the city and its people that ProtagonistA was astonished by the extent of the public debt when ProtagonistA left . ProtagonistA collected a large sum of money from the public before ProtagonistA was forced to admit ProtagonistA's own helplessness and to focus ProtagonistA's energies on the pressing business of default during some years of King Henry I 's reign . 
ProtagonistA was locked up in a small room with no windows and only one door . The door was locked from the outside . ProtagonistA was not a very good man , but ProtagonistA was not stupid either . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to find a way out of the room . ProtagonistA looked around and saw a small window high up on the wall . ProtagonistA also saw a chair in the corner of the room . ProtagonistA went to the window and tried to reach it , but ProtagonistA could not . ProtagonistA then went to the chair and stood on it .

ProtagonistA was a paralegal at a small law firm and ProtagonistA was given a file to examine .

ProtagonistA also found a document showing that the husband had purchased a life insurance policy with his wife as the beneficiary .

ProtagonistA was old enough to buy a horse and carriage , and had the least money in the world , ProtagonistA had the honor of buying one of what was then called the ' Baron 's Money - House ' in the street of St. Mary 's , where ProtagonistA now lives in a flat and furnished house , with a garden and a verandah , but in which there are scarcely twenty - five persons in the whole of it ; and ProtagonistA has lived , as ProtagonistA told it in the story , for ever and ever , without having any friends or any personal possessions of any sort ; not even the slightest money , and when ProtagonistA speaks of ProtagonistA's possessions it is in the sense of plenty of things ; but ProtagonistA has never been in want of anything , or of anything of any importance , in the whole world , or in ProtagonistA's whole lifetime ; and ProtagonistA certainly never has been in any very ill - fortune ; and yet ProtagonistA has been in many indeed fortunate and fortunate circumstances and has been in many fortunes of all kinds and all kinds ; and though ProtagonistA has never been in any financial difficulty , and if ProtagonistA had any doubt of that , ProtagonistA would have no doubt of it now , ProtagonistA has never been in a position of great or great inconvenience or difficulty ; and yet there have been times when ProtagonistA thought it all over , and when ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA was so poor and so wretched that ProtagonistA could not possibly have amassed so much wealth in ProtagonistA's lifetime ; and ProtagonistA had thought that ProtagonistA was much richer than ProtagonistA really was ; but there has never been any way of testing this , nor any way of having any thing like determination in the matter , which , if it had been possible , ProtagonistA would not have known how to work out for ProtagonistA ; and although ProtagonistA had long been in disuse , ProtagonistA had never had any taste for anything beyond the ordinary necessities of life ; and though , for long years ProtagonistA had been content as regards material things , the happy result had been , no doubt , that ProtagonistA had been at no loss for a career lasting an indefinite number of years , during which ProtagonistA had not failed in obtaining a livelihood whose success ProtagonistA had long known , or rather had been absolutely certain of , and had ever been fully conscious of ; and though for many years after ProtagonistA had ceased to be in want of any sort of material comforts , and even for a livelihood of a very temporal character , or of material comfort , within the smaller limits of the earth ; and though perhaps there had been times when ProtagonistA had been in some circumstances in which ProtagonistA had been doing better than ProtagonistA truly was ; at any rate , ProtagonistA had been in every respect in which ProtagonistA might have been expected to perform , in all probability at most one thousandth part of what ProtagonistA had performed , and ProtagonistA had been as perfectly consistent and as industrious as any other person in the world ; not merely in ProtagonistA's own mind , but also in the whole body of ProtagonistA's society ; and this proved that ProtagonistA had never been in any sort of distress .

The scientist had been working on his theory for years , and the ear had been listening to the stories of the planets for just as long . But the spectator , who had only just arrived , was the one who finally saw the truth .

ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way to ProtagonistB's office , and ProtagonistA made a noticeable effort to be friendly , although ProtagonistA knew well enough from ProtagonistA's long experience in the city that the term seemed more than a little strange to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB , looked at ProtagonistA with a confused expression .  Can ProtagonistB help ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked .  ProtagonistA need a runner ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistB 'm sorry , we do n't offer that service ,  ProtagonistB said .  But ProtagonistB can give ProtagonistA a list of people who might be able to help ProtagonistA .

ProtagonistA had dropped into the school , not knowing why ProtagonistA was there ; it was as though ProtagonistA 'd been dropped into the middle of nowhere . ProtagonistA looked around , confused , until ProtagonistA saw a sign that said  Welcome to Nowhere High School !  ProtagonistA laughed , relieved , and walked inside . 
ProtagonistA had been walking very slow all morning , reaching ProtagonistA's destination in the town of Trafalgar , about eight miles south of Manchester .

When ProtagonistA was sixteen , ProtagonistA was sitting alone in ProtagonistA's room , thinking of ProtagonistA's future after the war . ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a doctor , but now ProtagonistA was n't so sure . ProtagonistA had seen so much death and destruction during the war , and ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA could handle it anymore . ProtagonistA was also thinking about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistB was alive or dead , and ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA could handle the thought of losing ProtagonistB . 
It was the first day of spring in the year of ProtagonistA's coronation , and ProtagonistB was up at the royal court to welcome ProtagonistA to the throne ; but the weather had already turned hot and dry and the first - born were already starting to be gone . The court was in an uproar , with many of the lords and ladies already planning to leave for their summer homes . ProtagonistB was one of the few who remained , and ProtagonistB was determined to make the most of it . ProtagonistA was crowned that day , and ProtagonistB was there to witness it . ProtagonistB cheered along with the rest of the court , and even managed to get a glimpse of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was young and beautiful , and ProtagonistB could see the promise of a great reign ahead . However , the hot weather continued , and by the end of the week , most of the court had deserted ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was one of the few who remained , and ProtagonistB vowed to stand by ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA appreciated ProtagonistB's loyalty , and they became friends .

The hot weather eventually broke , and the court returned to normal . ProtagonistA's reign was a long and successful one , and ProtagonistB was always there by ProtagonistA's side . 
The sun was setting on the day that ProtagonistB called ProtagonistA to understand that ProtagonistA had overshot ProtagonistA's task .  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm sorry to say this , but ProtagonistA 've overshot ProtagonistA's task . ProtagonistA 're supposed to be cleaning the windows , not the whole house .  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB wanted ProtagonistA to do a good job .  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistB do , but ProtagonistA 've gone too far . ProtagonistB 'll have to ask ProtagonistA to leave .  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry .  ProtagonistA said as ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's things and left . 
ProtagonistA's eyeball was still open and ProtagonistA's gaze was wandering , but ProtagonistA was sure there was something under the surface of the water . ProtagonistA had been swimming for what felt like hours , and ProtagonistA's arms and legs were starting to feel heavy . ProtagonistA was just about to give up and turn back when ProtagonistA saw a flash of something white out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye . ProtagonistA swam towards it , and when ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA saw that it was a fish . ProtagonistA reached out to grab it , but it was too fast and it got away . ProtagonistA was about to turn back when ProtagonistA saw another fish , and then another . ProtagonistA forgot all about ProtagonistA's tired arms and legs and swam after them . ProtagonistA managed to catch a few , and when ProtagonistA got back to shore , ProtagonistA was exhausted but happy . 
The empty oven still hurt ProtagonistA's eyes when ProtagonistA stood over the brim . It was a reminder of all ProtagonistA had lost in the fire . ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA's family , ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA had nothing left but the clothes on ProtagonistA's back and the ashes of ProtagonistA's past . ProtagonistA had nowhere to go and no one to turn to . ProtagonistA was completely alone in the world . But ProtagonistA was a survivor . ProtagonistA had been through worse before and ProtagonistA would get through this . ProtagonistA would find a way to rebuild ProtagonistA's life and make a new home for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA would not let the fire defeat ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had been howling for hours . ProtagonistA had been howling ever since ProtagonistA saw the rat in ProtagonistA's house . The rat had been in ProtagonistA's house for days , and ProtagonistA had been trying to catch it . But every time ProtagonistA got close , the rat would run away . And now , ProtagonistA was howling . ProtagonistA had been howling for hours . The servant who lived in the house next door to ProtagonistA woke up the neighbor who lived in the house next door to ProtagonistA . The neighbor came over , and they both tried to calm ProtagonistA down . But ProtagonistA just kept howling . ProtagonistA howled and howled and howled . Finally , the neighbor called the police . The police came and took ProtagonistA away . They took ProtagonistA to the hospital . The doctors at the hospital said that ProtagonistA was howling because ProtagonistA was crazy . They said that ProtagonistA needed to be in a mental hospital . And so , ProtagonistA was taken to a mental hospital . ProtagonistA was there for years . And ProtagonistA never stopped howling . 
ProtagonistA should have known that ProtagonistB was a total loser . ProtagonistA was such a fool in the beginning , when ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB was a catch . ProtagonistB was always late , never had any money , and was always making excuses . But ProtagonistA was blinded by love , or so ProtagonistA thought . ProtagonistA should have known better when ProtagonistB started hitting ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistA stayed with ProtagonistB , because ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB . One day , ProtagonistA came home and found ProtagonistB in bed with another woman . That was the final straw . ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and left , never to look back . ProtagonistA should have known better from the beginning . 
Once upon a time there was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was sitting in the kitchen of ProtagonistB's mother 's house , staring up at the ceiling where magnificent paintings of the gods held the key to the universe . Suddenly , ProtagonistB heard a noise downstairs . It sounded like someone was coming up the stairs . ProtagonistB got up quietly and went to the top of the stairs to see who it was . It was ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had a suitcase in one hand and a bag in the other . When ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA smiled .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry to just show up like this , but ProtagonistA need a place to stay . ProtagonistA's parents kicked ProtagonistA out . ProtagonistB felt sorry for ProtagonistA and welcomed ProtagonistA into the house . ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA to a room where ProtagonistA could stay and promised to keep ProtagonistA safe . ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was going to be a part of ProtagonistB's life forever . 
ProtagonistA was ten years old , and ProtagonistA could tell by a glance that the kids who went to school in the little green hall were pretty active . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would have to be careful around them , and that it would be best to stay out of their way . However , ProtagonistA also knew that if ProtagonistA could just keep ProtagonistA's head down and stay out of trouble , ProtagonistA would be able to make it through the school year without any problems . 
There was once ProtagonistA ; ProtagonistA was named John . ProtagonistA was a very average looking girl , with brown hair and blue eyes . ProtagonistA was never really popular in school , but ProtagonistA was always friendly and nice to everyone . One day , ProtagonistA decided to change ProtagonistA's name to something more unique . ProtagonistA chose the name John , after ProtagonistA's favorite author . ProtagonistA started to write stories under ProtagonistA's new name , and soon became quite popular . People started to recognize ProtagonistA as the author of some of the best stories they had ever read . ProtagonistA was finally happy with who ProtagonistA was , and ProtagonistA's new name . 
A young man , a man of twenty four , ProtagonistA had the name of ProtagonistB , but for all that ProtagonistA was not a very good liar . ProtagonistA had been caught in lies before , and ProtagonistA knew that this time , ProtagonistA would be caught again . But ProtagonistA had to try . ProtagonistB was the only one who could help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had been caught stealing from the local grocery store . ProtagonistA had no money to pay for the food ProtagonistA had taken , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would be in big trouble if ProtagonistA was caught . ProtagonistA was desperate , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be able to help ProtagonistA . When ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB knew something was up . But ProtagonistB did n't say anything , and ProtagonistB agreed to help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was relieved , and ProtagonistA was grateful to ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's help . However , when the police came to arrest ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB was the one who told them where ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA was shocked , and ProtagonistA could n't believe that ProtagonistB had betrayed ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was heartbroken , and ProtagonistA would never trust ProtagonistB again . 
ProtagonistA was happy living ProtagonistA's life by ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't need anyone else and was content with ProtagonistA's own company . However , one day ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . At first ProtagonistA just thought of ProtagonistB as a friend , but soon ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA was in love . ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistB and finally felt like ProtagonistA belonged somewhere . 
Once upon a time , when the world was young , ProtagonistA was walking home one cold Thursday evening in August , and ProtagonistA came upon a little stone church on a green and flowery street , or in better letters Rickson , on the south side of ProtagonistB , in which the main thoroughfares led down to the narrow streets and galleries of the lower part of ProtagonistB . The door was shut , but a light burned within , and ProtagonistA could hear the sound of voices raised in song . ProtagonistA hesitated a moment , then lifted the latch and went in . It was a small , intimate service , and ProtagonistA felt immediately at home . The congregation was made up of people of all ages , from young children to elders , and they were all singing with such feeling and joy that ProtagonistA was soon caught up in the spirit of the moment and singing along with them . When the service was over , ProtagonistA went up to ProtagonistC to introduce ProtagonistA . They had a pleasant conversation , and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA telling ProtagonistC about ProtagonistA's life and how ProtagonistA had come to be in ProtagonistB . ProtagonistC was a kind man , and ProtagonistC listened to ProtagonistA's story with interest . When ProtagonistA had finished , ProtagonistC smiled and took ProtagonistA's hand . Welcome , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said .  ProtagonistC 'm glad ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's way to our little church . ProtagonistC hope ProtagonistA 'll come back again . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistC and said ProtagonistA would . As ProtagonistA walked back out into the night , ProtagonistA felt warmed by the experience and the welcome ProtagonistA had received . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would be back . 
There was ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always dreaming of ProtagonistA's wedding day and what it would be like . ProtagonistA had planned everything out perfectly in ProtagonistA's head , but ProtagonistA never thought that it would actually happen . One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the park and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and they began talking . They talked for hours and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had finally found ProtagonistA's soulmate . They exchanged numbers and went their separate ways . A few weeks later , they met up again and this time , they got married . They had a beautiful wedding and they lived happily ever after . 
ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was going to steal my twin sisters , but I thought ProtagonistA was joking . It turns out ProtagonistA was n't joking at all . ProtagonistA really did steal them ! I was so upset when I found out . I did n't know what to do . I was so worried about my sisters . I did n't know if they were okay or not . I was so mad at ProtagonistA . I wanted to confront ProtagonistA and ask ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA did it , but I was too scared . I did n't know what ProtagonistA would do to me if I did that . I was so confused and scared . I did n't know what to do . 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who loved to explore . One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole and decided to follow it . ProtagonistA ended up in ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had many adventures in ProtagonistB and made many new friends . ProtagonistA even met a talking rabbit ! ProtagonistA eventually found ProtagonistA's way back home , but ProtagonistA always remembered ProtagonistA's adventures in ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who lived in a time when the world was very different . ProtagonistA was born into a royal family and had a very privileged life . However , ProtagonistA was not content with simply being a princess . ProtagonistA wanted to make a difference in the world . ProtagonistA was very interested in history and ProtagonistA loved to learn about what had happened in the past . ProtagonistA was always asking questions and trying to understand why things had happened the way they did . ProtagonistA was particularly interested in the lives of famous women in history . One day , ProtagonistA had a very strange dream . In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful palace in heaven . There was a group of women there who were all chatting and laughing together . They were all very beautiful and they were all wearing the most exquisite dresses . ProtagonistA realised that ProtagonistA recognised some of the women . They were famous women from history ! ProtagonistA was amazed to see them all there together in heaven . Suddenly , one of the women turned to ProtagonistA and said ,  ProtagonistA , it has come to pass in heaven that there is ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA can well remember what events have taken place in history . ProtagonistA was stunned . ProtagonistA could n't believe that ProtagonistA was being spoken to by a woman from history . ProtagonistA was even more amazed when the woman told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was going to be given a very special gift . The woman said ,  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA have been chosen to receive the gift of knowledge . ProtagonistA will be able to remember everything that ProtagonistA have ever read about history . This knowledge will be a great asset to ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was thrilled . ProtagonistA could n't wait to start using ProtagonistA's new gift . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would be able to learn so much more about the world and its history . Thank you , Your Majesty , ProtagonistA thought , for this wonderful gift . 
ProtagonistA and Flutterbottom first met at a party . ProtagonistA had no idea who they were , but they hit it off immediately . They talked all night and ended up exchanging numbers . They 've been dating ever since . 
ProtagonistA rose from among the ruins of the great forest , and at first sight , ProtagonistA appeared to be nothing more than a helpless , ragged visitor . However , upon closer inspection , it was clear that ProtagonistA was far from helpless . ProtagonistA had been living in the forest for years , ever since ProtagonistA's family had been killed in a fire . ProtagonistA had been forced to fend for ProtagonistA , and had become quite adept at it . Over the years , ProtagonistA had made a home for ProtagonistA among the ruins of the forest , and had even managed to find some valuable treasures among the debris . Now , as ProtagonistA stood before the remains of ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA felt a sense of sadness and loss . But ProtagonistA was not alone . Standing beside ProtagonistA was ProtagonistA's faithful companion , a wolf who had been with ProtagonistA through thick and thin . Together , they would rebuild ProtagonistA's home and make it even better than before . 
ProtagonistA was walking home from ProtagonistA's friend 's house when ProtagonistA heard the rain start . ProtagonistA looked up and saw the rain coming down hard . ProtagonistA started to run , but ProtagonistA's shoes and coat got soaked through . ProtagonistA was cold and wet by the time ProtagonistA got home . ProtagonistA was glad to be inside and out of the rain . 
ProtagonistA sat and watched the sun go down slowly , with ProtagonistA's eyes closed . ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how it had led ProtagonistA to this moment . ProtagonistA thought about all the people ProtagonistA had known and all the places ProtagonistA had been . ProtagonistA thought about the good times and the bad times . And as ProtagonistA sat there , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was happy . ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life and with who ProtagonistA had become . 
ProtagonistA had been on the road for days , ever since ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's home in the city . ProtagonistA had been heading north , towards the mountains , but now ProtagonistA was stopped in ProtagonistA's tracks . The road had come to a sudden end , and there was nothing but a cold , dead end ahead of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA sighed as ProtagonistA put up the last of the white slacks that covered the back of the carriage . ProtagonistA had been hoping to find some kind of help or shelter before nightfall , but it seemed like that was not going to be the case . ProtagonistA was about to turn back around and head back the way ProtagonistA came when ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance . It sounded like someone was crying . ProtagonistA followed the noise until ProtagonistA came to a small clearing . In the center of the clearing was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was huddled in a ball , crying ProtagonistB's eyes out . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA did n't want to just leave ProtagonistB there , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to help ProtagonistB either . ProtagonistA was about to turn and go back the way ProtagonistA came when ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with pleading eyes . ProtagonistA sighed and sat down next to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA could say to make ProtagonistB feel better , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to try . It 's going to be alright ,  ProtagonistA said softly .  ProtagonistA 'm here now , and ProtagonistA wo n't let anything happen to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB stopped crying and looked at ProtagonistA with gratitude . ProtagonistA did n't know what else to do , so ProtagonistA just sat there with ProtagonistB until ProtagonistB fell asleep . When morning came , ProtagonistA woke ProtagonistB up and helped ProtagonistB to ProtagonistB's feet . ProtagonistB was still weak , but ProtagonistB was able to walk on ProtagonistB's own . ProtagonistA led ProtagonistB back to the road and helped ProtagonistB to find ProtagonistB's way home . ProtagonistA did n't know what would happen to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had done what ProtagonistA could . 
ProtagonistA was walking in the park when ProtagonistA saw a rabbit . ProtagonistA followed the rabbit and fell into a hole . When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a strange place . ProtagonistA saw a cat and asked it where ProtagonistA was . The cat said ,  ProtagonistA are in Wonderland .  Then ProtagonistA saw a Cheshire cat and it said ,  Welcome to Wonderland .  ProtagonistA met a lot of strange creatures in Wonderland and had many adventures . 
ProtagonistA had been playing for hours , and the time had come for ProtagonistA to break out of ProtagonistA's gloomy cell and play . ProtagonistA had been planning ProtagonistA's escape for weeks , and everything was finally in place . ProtagonistA had made a rope out of bedsheets and tied it to the bars of ProtagonistA's window . ProtagonistA had smuggled a knife out of the kitchen and hidden it in ProtagonistA's pocket . And ProtagonistA had made friends with the rats who lived in the cell next to ProtagonistA . Now , it was time to put ProtagonistA's plan into action . ProtagonistA waited until the guards had changed shift , and then ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's move . ProtagonistA climbed out the window and shimmied down the rope . Then ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way to the rat 's cell and let them out . As a diversion , they would create a commotion while ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's escape . ProtagonistA ran as fast as ProtagonistA could , and ProtagonistA did n't look back until ProtagonistA was outside the walls of the prison . ProtagonistA was finally free ! And ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's whole life ahead of ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was having a great time at the party . ProtagonistA was dancing and laughing with ProtagonistA's friends when ProtagonistA suddenly felt dizzy . ProtagonistA tried to hold on to something , but ProtagonistA could n't grasp anything and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA falling . ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistA's head on the ground and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die . ProtagonistA's last thought was that ProtagonistA did n't even dream that this would happen to ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA , in the year 1581 , appeared on the scene with a discovery ProtagonistA could not have dreamed of three years before : in the journal of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA found two passages which ProtagonistA named The Book of Dreams . The first was a description of a dream in which ProtagonistB had been visited by an angel , who had told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistC was in heaven and that ProtagonistB would soon join ProtagonistC there . The second was a dream in which ProtagonistB had been transported to a beautiful garden , where ProtagonistB had been given a flower by a stranger . ProtagonistA was amazed by these dreams and felt that they must have some special meaning . ProtagonistA was convinced that they were signs from ProtagonistD , and ProtagonistA was determined to find out what they meant . ProtagonistA began to study the Book of Dreams , and ProtagonistA soon came to believe that they were indeed messages from ProtagonistD . ProtagonistA began to share ProtagonistA's interpretation of the dreams with others , and ProtagonistA soon became known as a prophetess . ProtagonistA's fame spread far and wide , and ProtagonistA began to attract a following of people who believed in ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA became a leader of a new religious movement , and ProtagonistA began to preach about the power of dreams and their ability to reveal the future . ProtagonistA's followers began to call ProtagonistA the  Queen of Dreams . ProtagonistA's movement continued to grow , and ProtagonistA began to gain political power . ProtagonistA started to make predictions about the future , and many of ProtagonistA's prophecies came true . ProtagonistA predicted the rise of a great ruler who would bring peace to the world , and ProtagonistA was proved right when Queen Elizabeth I came to the throne . ProtagonistA's movement continued to grow , and ProtagonistA became one of the most influential people in England . ProtagonistA was a powerful voice for change , and ProtagonistA helped to bring about many reforms in the country . ProtagonistA is remembered as one of the most important figures in English history . 
In the midst of the great maze of blind alleys and crumbling buildings of London , on a sunny summer day in the year 1665 , ProtagonistA was able to enjoy the quiet hours of ProtagonistA's childhood when ProtagonistA alighted on streets where ProtagonistA could chat with pedestrians and shopkeepers without arousing suspicion . ProtagonistA had been warned by ProtagonistA's parents not to stray too far from home , for the city was a dangerous place for a young girl . But ProtagonistA was fearless , and ProtagonistA loved to explore . One day , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a part of the city ProtagonistA had never seen before . The streets were narrower here , and the buildings seemed to lean in towards each other . ProtagonistA felt a little uneasy , but ProtagonistA was curious to see what was around the next corner . As ProtagonistA turned a corner , ProtagonistA saw a group of boys standing in a circle . They were laughing and jeering , and in the center of the circle was ProtagonistB , cowering on the ground . ProtagonistA's heart went out to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA rushed forward to help ProtagonistB . But as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistB was not a child or an animal , but a small , old man . The boys were mocking ProtagonistB and throwing stones at ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was horrified . ProtagonistA ran to ProtagonistB and knelt down beside ProtagonistB .  Are ProtagonistB all right ?  ProtagonistA asked , gently helping ProtagonistB to sit up . ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with gratitude in ProtagonistB's eyes .  Thank ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  Those boys have been tormenting ProtagonistB for days . ProtagonistB 'm so glad ProtagonistA came along . ProtagonistA was about to help ProtagonistB to ProtagonistB's feet when ProtagonistA heard the sound of running footsteps . The boys had seen ProtagonistA talking to ProtagonistB and were coming back to finish the job . ProtagonistA grabbed ProtagonistB's hand and ran with ProtagonistB down the street , not looking back until they were safe . 
Not long ago , when ProtagonistA was a boy , ProtagonistA only knew how to read and write . ProtagonistA sent ProtagonistB a card that read : Beg for ProtagonistB's help . ProtagonistB was shocked and disappointed . ProtagonistB had hoped ProtagonistA would grow up to be a great man , but it seemed ProtagonistA was nothing more than a beggar . 
ProtagonistA sat on a rock on the banks of ProtagonistA's stream and stared out at the water in disbelief . That 's impossible , Rarity , ProtagonistA said , that 's impossible , even for great magic ! 
Ever since the day ProtagonistA was born , ProtagonistA has asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was really made of , and yet always comes away with the same conclusion : ProtagonistA is a very odd little thing indeed ! Even ProtagonistA's parents do n't know what to make of ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's constant questioning . They 've tried their best to answer ProtagonistA's questions , but they always seem to fall short . ProtagonistA has always been a curious child , but ProtagonistA's curiosity seems to be a bit more ... unique than most . ProtagonistA 's always asking about the world and how things work . ProtagonistA wants to know why the sky is blue and why people are born the way they are . ProtagonistA 's even asked ProtagonistA's parents if ProtagonistA was made in a laboratory!Needless to say , ProtagonistA's parents are at their wit 's end . They love ProtagonistA , but they just do n't know how to deal with ProtagonistA's never - ending questions . They 've tried their best to answer ProtagonistA , but they always seem to come up short . One day , ProtagonistA's parents sit ProtagonistA down and tell ProtagonistA that they 're going to send ProtagonistA to a special school . A school for children like ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA is excited at the prospect of finally finding answers to ProtagonistA's questions . So off ProtagonistA goes to the school , and for the first time in ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA belongs . ProtagonistA meets other children like ProtagonistA , and finally feels like ProtagonistA has found ProtagonistA's place in the world . At the school , ProtagonistA finally learns what ProtagonistA is . ProtagonistA learns that ProtagonistA is special and that ProtagonistA's curiosity is a gift . ProtagonistA learns that ProtagonistA has a unique perspective on the world that can help others . ProtagonistA is finally happy and content . ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA is different , but ProtagonistA also knows that ProtagonistA is special . And ProtagonistA is proud of it . 
ProtagonistA had been waiting in line for the bus for what felt like forever . ProtagonistA was getting impatient and was about to give up and go home when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB next to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was also waiting for the bus , and ProtagonistA could tell ProtagonistB was getting just as impatient as ProtagonistA was . Finally , the bus arrived , and they both got on . But as they were getting on , ProtagonistB bumped into ProtagonistA and knocked ProtagonistA down . ProtagonistA was so angry that ProtagonistA shouted at ProtagonistB ,  Time 's up , ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistA shouted down at ProtagonistB .  
ProtagonistA was a peg - legged pirate who had lost ProtagonistA's leg in a battle with a giant squid . ProtagonistA was now the captain of ProtagonistA's own ship , the Black Pearl . ProtagonistA was standing on the platform of one of the other ships , the White Shark , that was docked in the middle city . ProtagonistA was looking at the other ships and thinking about ProtagonistA's next move . ProtagonistA had to find a way to get ProtagonistA's ship out of the city and back to the open sea . ProtagonistA knew that the White Shark was a fast ship and could outrun any of the other ships in the city . ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistB , was a good friend of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA decided to go and talk to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB's help ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA need to get ProtagonistA's ship out of the city . Can ProtagonistB help me?Of course , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'll get ProtagonistB's crew ready and we 'll be out of here in no time . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB got their ships out of the city and back to the open sea . They parted ways , but promised to help each other again if needed . 
ProtagonistA sat in the saddle and considered the plan ProtagonistA 'd been given . It was a simple plan , really . Go to the old abandoned house on the edge of town , find the key hidden under the doormat , and let ProtagonistA in . Once inside , ProtagonistA was to find the treasure that was hidden there and bring it back to ProtagonistA's employer . It sounded easy enough , but ProtagonistA knew that there was always more to a plan than what was on the surface . ProtagonistA was sure that there were traps and pitfalls hidden within the house , waiting to trip ProtagonistA up . But ProtagonistA was also sure that ProtagonistA was up to the challenge . After all , ProtagonistA had been given the best horse in the stable and ProtagonistA was the best rider . With a final nod to ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA set off down the road , ready to face whatever challenges awaited ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had a solid build , and a big , broad smile on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA was always the life of the party , and ProtagonistA's friends loved ProtagonistA for it . One day , ProtagonistA was out walking with ProtagonistA's friends when ProtagonistA suddenly collapsed . ProtagonistA's friends rushed to ProtagonistA's side , but it was too late . ProtagonistA was gone . 
ProtagonistA's summer vacation had taken ProtagonistA halfway around the world , and by this time ProtagonistA was beginning to get tired of these ridiculously long journeys . ProtagonistA had been to Europe , Asia , Africa , and now ProtagonistA was in Australia . ProtagonistA was starting to feel like a world traveler , and ProtagonistA was getting homesick . ProtagonistA had been gone for two months , and ProtagonistA was starting to miss ProtagonistA's family and friends . ProtagonistA missed the familiarity of ProtagonistA's home , and ProtagonistA was starting to get tired of all the new places . ProtagonistA wanted to go home , but ProtagonistA had one more stop on ProtagonistA's itinerary : New Zealand . ProtagonistA was excited to see New Zealand , but ProtagonistA was also ready to go home . ProtagonistA was ready to be done with ProtagonistA's long journey , and ProtagonistA was looking forward to being home for the holidays . 
ProtagonistA had nothing to do with it , ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistA was just in the wrong place at the wrong time . But the police did n't believe ProtagonistA . They said the evidence was all there , plain as day . ProtagonistA was the only one who could have done it . But ProtagonistA swore ProtagonistA did n't do it . ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was innocent . The police did n't believe ProtagonistA . They said ProtagonistA was a liar . They said ProtagonistA was a cold - blooded killer . They said ProtagonistA was a monster . But ProtagonistA swore ProtagonistA did n't do it . ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was innocent . The jury did n't believe ProtagonistA . They said ProtagonistA was guilty . They said ProtagonistA was a killer . They said ProtagonistA was a monster . But ProtagonistA swore ProtagonistA did n't do it . ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was innocent . ProtagonistB did n't believe ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA was guilty . ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA was a killer . ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA was a monster . ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA was a cold - blooded killer . But ProtagonistA swore ProtagonistA did n't do it . ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was innocent . 
ProtagonistA woke up to a world that was red and white . ProtagonistA did n't know what had happened , but ProtagonistA could tell that it was a great victory . All the powers of Europe had shared in the victory , and ProtagonistA was eager to promote ProtagonistA's empire . ProtagonistA helped the conquered armies and made sure that they were well taken care of . ProtagonistA was a great leader and everyone respected ProtagonistA . 
On the summer day that ProtagonistA was born , ProtagonistA , with a weakling 's mind and thin frame , was drowned . The doctors said that it was a miracle that ProtagonistA had survived for as long as ProtagonistA had . ProtagonistA's parents were devastated . They had wanted a healthy baby so badly . When ProtagonistA was born , they had been so happy . But now , their happiness was gone . 
It was not long ago when ProtagonistA first visited the forest . ProtagonistA came across a herd of very lean , very short - legged geldings , without heads or tails , that were waiting for the moon to rise . The horses were very friendly and allowed ProtagonistA to pet them . ProtagonistA even rode on one of the horses . It was a very magical experience . 
ProtagonistA was a unicorn who was always getting into trouble . ProtagonistA was always doing something wrong and it seemed like nothing ProtagonistA did was ever right . ProtagonistB was the only one who ever stood up for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB was always there to help ProtagonistA out .  Just leave ProtagonistA alone , please . ProtagonistA might not be a good unicorn , but ProtagonistA 's not going anywhere .  
ProtagonistA had always been a bright girl , but ProtagonistA was especially sharp for ProtagonistA's eleven years . ProtagonistA had been so busy with business of which ProtagonistA did not know at the time just how many it involved — foremost of all , business in the real world . In the real world , ProtagonistA had to be careful . ProtagonistA had to know who ProtagonistA could trust and who ProtagonistA could n't , what was safe and what was n't . It was a lot of work , but ProtagonistA was up for the challenge . One day , ProtagonistA was out walking near ProtagonistA's home when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was lurking in the shadows , and ProtagonistB looked shifty . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should stay away from ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was curious . ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistB cautiously . Hello ,  ProtagonistA said .  Can ProtagonistA help you?The man stepped out of the shadows . ProtagonistB was tall and thin , with a long , hooked nose . ProtagonistB grinned at ProtagonistA , revealing yellowed teeth . Yes , ProtagonistA can help ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'm looking for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's name is Alice . Do ProtagonistA know her?Alice 's heart skipped a beat . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should n't tell ProtagonistB anything , but ProtagonistA was also afraid of what would happen if ProtagonistA did n't . ProtagonistA decided to stall for time . Maybe ,  ProtagonistA said .  What do ProtagonistB want with her?I have a message for ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  From ProtagonistA's father . ProtagonistA's father had been dead for years . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was lying . ProtagonistA do n't believe ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA's father is dead . The man 's smile faded . ProtagonistB's eyes turned cold . I do n't have time for this ,  ProtagonistB said .  If ProtagonistA see ProtagonistA , tell ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA's father is waiting for ProtagonistA . And tell ProtagonistA to come alone . With that , ProtagonistB turned and walked away . ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB go , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest . ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistB was up to no good . ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistA and warn ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was driving down the main thoroughfares of London when ProtagonistA saw in the distance what looked to ProtagonistA like some vast city , on a smooth , grey sea . ProtagonistA drove on into the world of the great traders and navigators and found ProtagonistA in a huge port with many large ships . The port was very busy with a strong trading post and ProtagonistA was amazed at all the activity . ProtagonistA watched for a while and then drove on , feeling very lucky to have stumbled upon this hidden gem . 
ProtagonistA woke up from ProtagonistA's dream panting . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had just run a marathon . In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA was in a vast garden surrounded by a crowd of people . A historian , a naturalist , a sculptor , and racing horses were among them . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was the only one who could see them . The ladies standing on the hill were the only ones who were not looking at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt a tap on ProtagonistA's shoulder and woke up to find ProtagonistB shaking ProtagonistA awake .  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA were moaning in ProtagonistA's sleep . Are ProtagonistA okay ?  ProtagonistB asked with a worried look on ProtagonistB's face .  ProtagonistA 'm fine , ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA just had a really weird dream ,  ProtagonistA replied . ProtagonistB nodded and went back to bed . ProtagonistA lay in ProtagonistA's bed for a few more minutes , trying to remember the details of ProtagonistA's dream . ProtagonistA was sure that it meant something , but ProtagonistA could n't quite figure out what . 
ProtagonistA was out hiking on the Colorado hills when ProtagonistA was attacked by a rattlesnake . The snake slashed ProtagonistA's leg , severing a lot of flesh and leaving ProtagonistA with one leg . ProtagonistA was in a lot of pain and knew ProtagonistA needed to get to a hospital quickly . ProtagonistA managed to make ProtagonistA's way down the hill and flag down a passing car . The driver took ProtagonistA to the nearest hospital where ProtagonistA was treated for ProtagonistA's injuries . ProtagonistA was lucky that the driver was there to help ProtagonistA . If ProtagonistA had been left alone on the hill , ProtagonistA might not have made it to the hospital in time . ProtagonistA was also lucky that the snake did n't bite ProtagonistA anywhere else on ProtagonistA's body . ProtagonistA recovered from ProtagonistA's injuries and is now able to hike and enjoy the outdoors again . 
ProtagonistA was riding in the midst of a dry and calm autumn season . ProtagonistA rode on clear , and ProtagonistA knew that the wind of Britain was blowing . And ProtagonistA was safe and ProtagonistA would have to ride on . It was a familiar feeling to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was riding on comfortable white , and ProtagonistA knew that the air was cool . And if ProtagonistA was found hanged , ProtagonistA could always lie down for a long time and sleep peacefully and rest easy . 
ProtagonistA was an old woman who lived on a horse . ProtagonistA was very much of this world , but ProtagonistA had neither the strength nor the patience for weariness nor for labor . ProtagonistA was never mowing grass alone . One day , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB would like to help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB agreed , and they mowed the grass together . 
Near the end of the last century , it may be , there came as a terrible surprise to ProtagonistA , that from the first days of the world until the end of the last , ProtagonistA had not been able to reckon with one hundred and fifty millions of years . 
It was a beautiful day outside , and ProtagonistA was feeling good . ProtagonistA had just finished ProtagonistA's morning prayers and was about to enjoy a cup of tea when ProtagonistA heard a commotion coming from the roof of the Boston house . ProtagonistA went to investigate and saw that a group of ProtagonistB's followers were gathered there , apparently preparing to re - enact something . ProtagonistA was curious to know what was going on , so ProtagonistA asked one of the members what was happening . The man explained that they were going to re - enact the moment when ProtagonistB was first lodged in the Boston house . ProtagonistA was intrigued and decided to watch . The group went through the motions of the event , and ProtagonistA was impressed by their dedication . When it was over , ProtagonistA thanked the members for letting ProtagonistA witness the event and went back to ProtagonistA's tea . 
You 're gon na eat ProtagonistA , said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA lay down on the sand , but do n't kill ProtagonistA . The sun was setting and the waves were crashing and ProtagonistA was getting hungry . ProtagonistA had been stranded on this deserted island for days now , and ProtagonistA was starting to get desperate . ProtagonistA had seen the signs of a shipwreck on the other side of the island , so ProtagonistA knew there must be other people around here somewhere . But ProtagonistA had yet to find them . As ProtagonistA lay there , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA sat up , hopeful that ProtagonistB was another castaway . But as ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB was not a person at all , but a large , furry creature . ProtagonistB was a ProtagonistA was terrified . ProtagonistA had heard stories of people being killed and eaten by bears . ProtagonistA scrambled to ProtagonistA's feet and started to run , but ProtagonistB was faster than ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB caught up to ProtagonistA and knocked ProtagonistA to the ground . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes , expecting the worst . But instead of being eaten , ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistB licking ProtagonistA's face . When ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes , ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB looked just as scared as ProtagonistA felt . Please do n't eat ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA begged . I'm not going to eat ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'm lost too . ProtagonistB 've been wandering around this island for days , looking for food . ProtagonistB 'm so hungry ProtagonistB ca n't think straight . ProtagonistA felt a pang of sympathy for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew how ProtagonistB felt . Let 's team up ,  ProtagonistA said .  If we work together , we 're sure to find food . The bear nodded in agreement . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB spent the next few days searching the island for food . They found some berries and nuts , which sustained them , but they were both still very hungry . One day , they came across a cave . This looks promising ,  ProtagonistA said . They went inside and found a feast ! There was fruit , bread , and even some cooked meat . They ate until they were stuffed and then went back outside . Thank ProtagonistB for not eating ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said to ProtagonistB . Thank ProtagonistA for teaming up with ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'm glad we found food , but ProtagonistB 'm even more glad we found each other .  
ProtagonistA was three years old when ProtagonistB died . ProtagonistA remembers that ProtagonistB was always so kind to ProtagonistA , even when ProtagonistA was having a bad day . ProtagonistA would always go to ProtagonistB's house after school and they would spend hours talking and laughing together . When ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistA was heartbroken . ProtagonistA did n't know how to cope with the loss of ProtagonistB . But over time , ProtagonistA began to heal . ProtagonistA started to remember all the good times they had together and it helped ProtagonistA to feel better . Now , whenever ProtagonistA thinks of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA smiles .

ProtagonistA did n't know that would happen . ProtagonistA 'm so sorry . ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistC more than anything in the world . ProtagonistA 'm so sorry .

ProtagonistA was staying at a hotel for a conference . ProtagonistA was sitting in the hotel restaurant , having breakfast before ProtagonistA's first day of meetings . ProtagonistA took little notice of the dish next to ProtagonistA on the table . It was n't until ProtagonistA was finished with ProtagonistA's own breakfast and about to get up to leave that ProtagonistA realized the dish next to ProtagonistA was still full of food . ProtagonistA must have been really hungry this morning and not even noticed ! ProtagonistA felt a little embarrassed , but was glad ProtagonistA had n't made a scene by devouring someone else 's breakfast . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a trouble , but ProtagonistA had been more of a bother than most when ProtagonistA had been twelve . ProtagonistA had gotten into a lot of fights with other kids and had even been suspended from school for a week . ProtagonistA's parents had been at their wit 's end with ProtagonistA . They had tried everything they could think of , but nothing had worked . Finally , they had decided to send ProtagonistA to therapy . ProtagonistA had been skeptical at first , but ProtagonistA had soon started to open up to ProtagonistA's therapist . ProtagonistA had talked about ProtagonistA's problems and ProtagonistA's feelings . ProtagonistA had even started to work on some of ProtagonistA's issues .

ProtagonistA was walking in the palace garden when ProtagonistA saw a water droplet that had fallen from the sky the night before . The droplet bobbed down and out of the bush , and ProtagonistA followed it . The droplet led ProtagonistA to a secret door in the palace that ProtagonistA had never seen before . ProtagonistA opened the door and found a beautiful garden that ProtagonistA had never seen before . The garden was full of flowers , and ProtagonistA was amazed . ProtagonistA followed the droplet as it led ProtagonistA to a fountain in the center of the garden . The droplet jumped into the fountain and ProtagonistA followed . When ProtagonistA jumped into the fountain , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a different world . 
ProtagonistA was having a lovely time at the tea party when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB's most recent folly . ProtagonistA was so shocked and appalled by it that ProtagonistA cried out ,  Wait , that 's a new plot !  ProtagonistB had outdone ProtagonistB this time , and ProtagonistA was determined to stop ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA stood up and announced to the others that ProtagonistA was going to put a stop to ProtagonistB's madness once and for all . ProtagonistA marched over to where ProtagonistB was standing and confronted ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA demanded to know what ProtagonistB was thinking , creating such a ridiculous plot . ProtagonistB just laughed and said that ProtagonistB loved to see the look on ProtagonistA's face when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had been outsmarted . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was just too predictable and that it was time for ProtagonistA to learn a lesson . ProtagonistA was so angry that ProtagonistA wanted to scream , but ProtagonistA knew that would only give ProtagonistB the satisfaction of knowing ProtagonistB had gotten to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and walked away , vowing to never give ProtagonistB the satisfaction of winning again . 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the front steps of their house , looking down at the dusty back lot . ProtagonistA did n't believe it when ProtagonistA saw a figure walking towards ProtagonistA . It was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB in years . ProtagonistA , is that really ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB said , as ProtagonistB got closer . ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA ca n't believe it ! What are ProtagonistB doing here ?  ProtagonistA said , as ProtagonistA got up to give ProtagonistB a hug . ProtagonistB was in the neighborhood and thought ProtagonistB 'd stop by to say hi . ProtagonistB 'm sorry ProtagonistB have n't been in touch , but ProtagonistB 've been really busy . I understand . ProtagonistA 've been busy too . But it 's so good to see you!They chatted for a while , catching up on old times . It was like no time had passed at all . I should go ,  ProtagonistB said finally .  But it was great to see ProtagonistA . We should keep in touch this time . I'd like that ,  ProtagonistA said . They said their goodbyes and ProtagonistB walked away . ProtagonistA sat back down on the steps , smiling to ProtagonistA . It was nice to have old friends back in ProtagonistA's life . 
ProtagonistA was a smart little thing . Almost two years old . ProtagonistA was not really a girl , but which people thought was a girl , because ProtagonistA would turn into ProtagonistB instead of into a girl . And ProtagonistA had been mistaken , they say , from the first moment when ProtagonistA was born . ProtagonistA had believed everything ProtagonistA had been told . But one day , ProtagonistA began to doubt . ProtagonistA started to wonder why ProtagonistA was always turned into ProtagonistB . Was it because ProtagonistA was really a bad person ? Or was it because the people around ProtagonistA were just ProtagonistA decided to find out for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA started to act like a girl , and to ProtagonistA's surprise , ProtagonistA began to turn into one . The more ProtagonistA did it , the more ProtagonistA became like a girl , until ProtagonistA was one completely . Now , ProtagonistA is a happy girl , and ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA was never really a bad person , despite what people might have thought . ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA was just misunderstood , and that ProtagonistA is now exactly who ProtagonistA was meant to be . 
ProtagonistA was looking at the pile of papers which covered the table and ProtagonistA said ,  What a sad sight , to lose one 's mind .  ProtagonistA was thinking about how ProtagonistA's own mind had been slipping lately . ProtagonistA could n't remember things like ProtagonistA used to and ProtagonistA was having trouble concentrating . It was scary to think about losing ProtagonistA's mind , but ProtagonistA knew it was a possibility . ProtagonistA had seen it happen to other people and ProtagonistA did n't want to end up like them . 
As soon as ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the bed and stared out the window . It was a beautiful day outside , and ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit excited . ProtagonistA got up and went to the window , opening it and taking a deep breath of the fresh air . It felt good to be alive . ProtagonistA turned and went back to ProtagonistA's bed , lying down and closing ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA let out a long sigh , feeling the tension leave ProtagonistA's body . It was going to be a good day . 
ProtagonistA was wearing the same dress , and the same red dress , and the same black dress , and at the same time ProtagonistA was in the same place , in the same sudden moment , in the same instant , in the same place , in the same place , ProtagonistA was in the same place , ProtagonistA was wearing the same dress , and the same dress , and ProtagonistA was walking along , and ProtagonistA just kept walking , and ProtagonistA stopped in a little corner ( not much to go on there , there 's no way to tell where exactly ) and looked around for a second , and then laid ProtagonistA's head down on the hood of the car and leaned ProtagonistA's head against the passenger side window . 
There she is , said ProtagonistA after looking at the chart in ProtagonistA's hands . ProtagonistA was pointing to a small island in the middle of the ocean . According to the map , the island was uninhabited . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends were on a treasure hunt and this was their final clue . They had been searching for weeks and were getting tired . But this was the last clue , so they had to find the island . They got on their boat and started to row . It took them all day , but eventually they made it to the island . They got off the boat and started to look around . There was n't much to see . There was a small beach and some trees . But there was no treasure . ProtagonistA's friends were getting angry . They started to argue with each other . But ProtagonistA was calm . ProtagonistA knew there must be a clue on the island . ProtagonistA started to look around again . And that 's when ProtagonistA saw it . There was a small hole in the ground . ProtagonistA dug around it and found a chest . Inside the chest was the treasure they had been looking for . 
ProtagonistA was in so much pain that ProtagonistA could barely move . ProtagonistA slowly rolled over , trying to get away from the source of the pain . When ProtagonistA finally stopped moving , ProtagonistA looked up and saw ProtagonistB lying on the ground next to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's eyes widened in shock and ProtagonistA stared at ProtagonistB , wondering if ProtagonistB was awake . 
ProtagonistA had been waiting in line for what felt like hours . ProtagonistA was getting impatient and was about to ask the person in front of ProtagonistA what was taking so long when ProtagonistA finally reached the front . There were two men behind a counter , and the one on the right handed ProtagonistA a stack of papers . ProtagonistA , do n't know what else to say ,  said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA took the stack of papers from the man on the right . ProtagonistA leafed through them , not really sure what ProtagonistA was looking for .  What is all this ?  ProtagonistA asked , finally . It 's the paperwork for the divorce ,  the man said , matter - of - factly . ProtagonistA's heart sank . ProtagonistA had been hoping against hope that this was all a mistake , that ProtagonistA's husband had n't really filed for divorce . But here it was , in black and white . ProtagonistA was about to be a single woman again . Is there anything else ProtagonistA need to do ?  ProtagonistA asked , ProtagonistA's voice trembling . No , that 's it . ProtagonistA can go now ,  the man said . ProtagonistA turned and walked away , the papers clutched in ProtagonistA's hand . ProtagonistA's life as ProtagonistA knew it was over . 
ProtagonistA was walking home from school when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing on the side of the road . ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was in distress , so ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistB to see if ProtagonistA could help . ProtagonistB , said that ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's husband were stranded in the area and were looking for a place to stay for the night . ProtagonistB asked if ProtagonistA knew of any farms or houses in the area that might be able to help them out . ProtagonistA , being the helpful person ProtagonistA is , said that ProtagonistA knew of a farmhouse not too far from there that might be able to help . ProtagonistA offered to take ProtagonistB there , and ProtagonistB accepted . As they walked , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA about ProtagonistA's life and what ProtagonistA liked to do . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB all about ProtagonistA's life on the farm and how much ProtagonistA loved animals . ProtagonistB was very interested in everything ProtagonistA had to say . When they arrived at the farmhouse , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to come inside and meet ProtagonistB's husband . ProtagonistA hesitated , but ProtagonistB assured ProtagonistA that they were just a harmless old couple . ProtagonistA walked into the farmhouse and was immediately greeted by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a very friendly man , and ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's wife made ProtagonistA feel right at home . They offered ProtagonistA a drink and some food , and ProtagonistA accepted . As ProtagonistA was about to leave , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA would like to come and visit them sometime . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA would love to , and the two exchanged addresses . ProtagonistA walked home that night feeling happy and content . ProtagonistA had made some new friends , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would always remember ProtagonistA's meeting with the Listers . 
ProtagonistA came in a beaten and battered carriage . ProtagonistA was carrying ProtagonistB across the country . ProtagonistB had been wounded in battle and ProtagonistA was taking ProtagonistB home . ProtagonistA was tired and the journey was long , but ProtagonistA did not complain . ProtagonistA just kept going . When they finally arrived home , ProtagonistA put ProtagonistB in bed and tended to ProtagonistB's wounds . ProtagonistA was relieved to be home , but ProtagonistA was also worried about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA did not know if ProtagonistB would make it through the night . 
ProtagonistA had seen true horror cross flying over a dozen times during ProtagonistA's time as head of the Department of Magical and Philosophical Research , but ProtagonistA never imagined that one might actually be made at the end of one 's life ! As ProtagonistA lay on ProtagonistA's deathbed , ProtagonistA could see the dark shadow of the creature flying towards ProtagonistA , its mouth open in a silent scream . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's time was up . There was a bright flash of light and then ProtagonistA was gone . 
ProtagonistA was standing in the doorway , ProtagonistA's dark hair up in a ponytail . ProtagonistA was wearing a white tank top and denim shorts . ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA was about to go for a run . I asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was up to and ProtagonistA told me ProtagonistA was going for a run . I told ProtagonistA I would join ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA smiled and we took off . We ran for about an hour and then we stopped to get some water . We were both sweating and out of breath . We sat down on the curb and rested for a few minutes . It was a beautiful day and I was happy to be spending it with ProtagonistA . We talked and laughed as we sat there in the sun . I knew I was falling for ProtagonistA . Eventually , we got up and started running again . We ran all the way back to ProtagonistA's house . When we got there , we were both exhausted . We said goodbye and I went home . I could n't stop thinking about ProtagonistA . I was falling in love with ProtagonistA . I knew I had to tell ProtagonistA . The next day , I went over to ProtagonistA's house and told ProtagonistA how I felt . ProtagonistA smiled and said ProtagonistA felt the same way . We hugged and kissed and we 've been together ever since . 
ProtagonistA was standing before ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA's hair aflame . ProtagonistA had been in the forest for days , ever since ProtagonistA had run away from home . ProtagonistA was tired , and hungry , and ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's family . But ProtagonistA was also determined to find ProtagonistA's way back to them . ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was standing in the middle of the path , and ProtagonistB was holding a lantern . ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was waiting for someone . When ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB smiled and held out ProtagonistB's hand .  Hello , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 've been waiting for ProtagonistA .  
Something 's up , said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA cradled the great volcano in ProtagonistA's hands . It had been acting strange lately , and ProtagonistA was worried . ProtagonistA had never seen a volcano up close before , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to expect . The last time it had erupted , it had destroyed ProtagonistA's home and killed ProtagonistA's family . ProtagonistA did n't want that to happen again . ProtagonistA had been watching the volcano for weeks , and ProtagonistA was sure that something was going to happen soon . ProtagonistA could feel it in the air . The volcano was getting ready to blow . ProtagonistA had to warn the others . ProtagonistA had to get them to safety before it was too late . ProtagonistA ran through the streets , shouting warnings to everyone ProtagonistA saw . ProtagonistA had to get them to safety before the volcano erupted . It was too late . The volcano blew , and ProtagonistA was killed in the explosion . 
It was a hot February day in the year 1826 , when ProtagonistA lay the body of ProtagonistB , to the sad and uncharitable . ProtagonistB had been struck down by a sudden illness and had died within days . ProtagonistA had been there for ProtagonistB , holding ProtagonistB's hand and telling ProtagonistB everything would be alright . But it was n't and now ProtagonistB was gone . The funeral was a small and somber affair . There were only a few people there to pay their respects and ProtagonistA felt so alone . ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's only family and now ProtagonistA had no one . As ProtagonistA stood there , looking at ProtagonistB's grave , ProtagonistA swore ProtagonistA would never let ProtagonistA be so vulnerable again . ProtagonistA would never let anyone in and ProtagonistA would never love anyone as much as ProtagonistA had loved ProtagonistB . From that day on , ProtagonistA became a cold and heartless woman . 
There was once ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole and decided to follow it . ProtagonistA ended up in ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had many adventures in ProtagonistB and made many new friends . Eventually , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's way back home . 
ProtagonistA was overjoyed when ProtagonistA was told that ProtagonistA would be having dinner with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had always wanted to meet ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would be able to provide ProtagonistA with a fine meal . When ProtagonistA arrived at ProtagonistB's house , ProtagonistA was amazed by its beauty . ProtagonistB was very handsome and ProtagonistB's garden was exquisite . They had a wonderful time together and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would always remember this day . 
ProtagonistA was facing away from the screen on the golden - tufted hill that bounded ProtagonistA's sea - walls , and the sunbeams streaming across the black sand stilled as it was . The light played over ProtagonistA's features and ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's head towards the sun , eyes half - lidded in pleasure . ProtagonistA breathed in the salty air and let ProtagonistA's body relax into the warmth . This was ProtagonistA's favorite spot on the island , where ProtagonistA could sit and watch the waves crash against the rocks , and the seagulls wheel and cry . It was a place of peace and solitude , and ProtagonistA cherished it . 
ProtagonistA had been standing in the doorway all night , waiting for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been waiting for ProtagonistB to come home from work , but ProtagonistB never came . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was working late , but ProtagonistA could n't help but worry . ProtagonistA was about to go to bed when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB's key in the door . ProtagonistA ran to ProtagonistB and hugged ProtagonistB tightly . ProtagonistA was so relieved ProtagonistB was finally home . 
ProtagonistA was living in ProtagonistA's cousin 's vast old house in Pannonward called the Park . It was early summer and the days were long and lazy . ProtagonistA loved spending time in the park , reading and picnicking with ProtagonistA's friends . One day , while ProtagonistA was enjoying the sunshine , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was tall and handsome , and ProtagonistB had a kind face . ProtagonistA felt drawn to ProtagonistB and they began talking . ProtagonistB's name was William and ProtagonistB was a gentleman . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had come to the park to find a wife . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had been looking for a young lady who was beautiful , intelligent , and kind . When ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB had found ProtagonistB's perfect match . They began courting and soon they were married . They were very happy together and they had a beautiful life . 
ProtagonistA had only been a woman of ProtagonistA's word , when a magic box stood in ProtagonistA's front door , containing a box of eleven tiny little things , wrapped in a blue and white little envelope . ProtagonistA had promised ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA would never open it , but the temptation was too great . ProtagonistA carefully unwrapped the envelope andopened the box . Inside were eleven miniature people , each no bigger than ProtagonistA's thumb . They were all fast asleep . ProtagonistA could n't resist poking ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB stirred and opened ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistB was no bigger than a grain of rice . Seeing ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB let out a cry of alarm and scrambled to hide behind a blade of grass . The other ten woke up and followed suit . ProtagonistA was so astonished that ProtagonistA forgot to be scared . ProtagonistA watched as the eleven tiny people scurried about , trying to hide from ProtagonistA . After a few minutes , they seemed to have calmed down and began to explore their new surroundings . ProtagonistA sat down and watched them , feeling like ProtagonistA had been given a gift . These little people were so full of life and curiosity . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget them . 
ProtagonistA was over the moon when ProtagonistA found out ProtagonistA was pregnant . ProtagonistA immediately called ProtagonistA's best friend to share the news .  That 's amazing !  ProtagonistA's friend said .  I 'm so happy for ProtagonistA !  
ProtagonistA had always wanted a dog . ProtagonistA would beg ProtagonistA's parents for one every time they went to the pet store , but they always said no . So , when ProtagonistA's mother took ProtagonistA to dinner and asked ProtagonistA whether ProtagonistA would like a dog , ProtagonistA was ecstatic . ProtagonistA immediately said yes and they went to pick out ProtagonistB that very night . ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB quickly became ProtagonistA's best friend . ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistB for walks , play fetch with ProtagonistB in the yard , and snuggle with ProtagonistB at night . ProtagonistB was the perfect dog and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly . 
ProtagonistA was a woman who loved to travel . ProtagonistA was always on the move , never staying in one place for too long . ProtagonistA's wanderlust had led ProtagonistA to many different places and ProtagonistA had made many friends along the way . ProtagonistA was a beautiful woman , with long dark hair and bright blue eyes . ProtagonistA was always well - dressed and carried ProtagonistA with a regal air . However , ProtagonistA's appearance sometimes caused consternation among ProtagonistA's fellow travellers . ProtagonistA was known throughout the city for ProtagonistA's beauty and ProtagonistA's charm . ProtagonistA was always the life of the party and always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face . 
ProtagonistA was a very special girl . ProtagonistA was the daughter of Henry Vane , Earl of Essex , cousin of King James . And , as is usual with them , ProtagonistA's father was a king . ProtagonistA was very beautiful and very intelligent . ProtagonistA was also very kind and always helped others . One day , ProtagonistA was walking in the forest and ProtagonistA saw a rabbit . The rabbit was very scared and it ran away . ProtagonistA followed the rabbit and ProtagonistA found a hole in the ground . ProtagonistA looked in the hole and ProtagonistA saw a beautiful garden . In the garden there was a big house . ProtagonistA went into the house and ProtagonistA saw a lot of people . They were all very happy and they were singing and dancing . ProtagonistA was very happy too . 
Two weeks ago , in the town on the Mississippi , there lived ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA's name was John , and ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's wife . They had been married for ten years , and they had two children . ProtagonistA was a carpenter , and ProtagonistB was a housewife . They were both happy with their life , but they both wanted something more . One day , ProtagonistA came home from work and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had been thinking about getting a divorce . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA was not happy with their life , and ProtagonistA wanted to try something new . ProtagonistB was shocked , and ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to think about it for a week . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB did not want to make any decisions right away . ProtagonistA agreed , and ProtagonistA went to work the next day . However , ProtagonistA could not stop thinking about what ProtagonistB had said . ProtagonistA thought about it all day , and ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA wanted to get a divorce . ProtagonistA went home and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had made up ProtagonistA's mind . ProtagonistB was heartbroken , but ProtagonistB knew that there was nothing ProtagonistB could do . ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA ProtagonistA's divorce papers , and ProtagonistB watched ProtagonistA leave ProtagonistB's life . ProtagonistB was sad , but ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB had to move on . 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of ProtagonistA's bed , looking out at the booming blue sky . The sun was shining so bright that it felt like it was burning ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA squinted and turned away , but not before ProtagonistA saw the bright orange and red leaves of the trees . Fall was ProtagonistA's favorite time of year , and ProtagonistA loved nothing more than to sit in ProtagonistA's room and watch the leaves change color . But today , ProtagonistA had other plans . ProtagonistA was going to go outside and enjoy the weather while it lasted . ProtagonistA quickly got dressed and grabbed ProtagonistA's jacket , heading for the door . But before ProtagonistA could even take one step outside , ProtagonistA heard a loud boom . It sounded like thunder , but ProtagonistA knew it could n't be . The sky was clear and there was n't a cloud in sight . ProtagonistA slowly opened the door and peeked outside , half expecting to see a monster or something . But all ProtagonistA saw was a large , white rabbit running around in circles . It was the strangest thing ProtagonistA had ever seen . ProtagonistA quickly shut the door and leaned against it , trying to catch ProtagonistA's breath . ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA must be dreaming . There was no other explanation for what ProtagonistA had just seen . But then ProtagonistA heard the rabbit pounding on the door , and ProtagonistA knew this was real . ProtagonistA had to find a way to get out of this situation . ProtagonistA opened the door a crack and peeked out again . The rabbit was gone , but ProtagonistA could hear it running around in the bushes . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be careful , but ProtagonistA also knew ProtagonistA had to find a way out of here . ProtagonistA slowly stepped outside , keeping ProtagonistA's eyes peeled for the rabbit . But as ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's first step , ProtagonistA felt something give way beneath ProtagonistA's feet . ProtagonistA looked down and saw that ProtagonistA was standing on a large , round , white rabbit . It was the same rabbit ProtagonistA had seen before , but it was now lying on its back with its legs in the air . ProtagonistA knew this was ProtagonistA's chance to escape . ProtagonistA quickly ran away from the rabbit and did n't look back until ProtagonistA was safely inside ProtagonistA's house . ProtagonistA leaned against the door , trying to catch ProtagonistA's breath . ProtagonistA was sure this was the strangest day ProtagonistA had ever experienced . 
ProtagonistA had always loved the farm ProtagonistA lived on . It was ProtagonistA's home and ProtagonistA could n't imagine living anywhere else . So when ProtagonistA's cousin 's pet phoenix needed a home , ProtagonistA knew just the place . ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's neighbor and bought the farm . It was a lot of money , but ProtagonistA did n't mind . ProtagonistA wanted to make sure ProtagonistA's cousin 's pet had a comfortable and safe place to live . The first time ProtagonistA saw the phoenix , ProtagonistA was mesmerized . It was a beautiful creature and ProtagonistA was happy to have been able to help provide a home for it . 
ProtagonistA was a bit confused when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's school . ProtagonistA thought that maybe ProtagonistA was seeing things but when ProtagonistA looked again , ProtagonistB was still there . ProtagonistA did n't know what to think or do so ProtagonistA just stared at ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB stared back at ProtagonistA and then ProtagonistB smiled . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart flutter a bit and ProtagonistA quickly looked away . ProtagonistA did n't know why but ProtagonistA felt drawn to ProtagonistB . Throughout the day , ProtagonistA would catch glimpses of ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA started to feel more and more comfortable around ProtagonistB . By the end of the day , ProtagonistA had mustered up the courage to talk to ProtagonistB . Hi , ProtagonistA 'm Alice ,  ProtagonistA said shyly . I'm John ,  ProtagonistB replied . ProtagonistA and John quickly became friends and they would often talk and laugh together . ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA had finally found someone who understood ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had been sleeping all that time and was still sleeping when ProtagonistA began to cry . It was a fitful , restless sleep , and ProtagonistA's dreams were filled with images of ProtagonistA's loved ones dying . One by one , they all vanished , until ProtagonistA was the only one left . ProtagonistA woke up crying , and it took ProtagonistA a moment to realize that ProtagonistA was alone in ProtagonistA's room . The sun was streaming in through the window , and ProtagonistA could hear the birds singing outside . It was a beautiful day , but ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA's heart had been ripped out . ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to the window , looking out at the world as ProtagonistA wiped ProtagonistA's tears away . 
ProtagonistA looked as though ProtagonistA had been through hell — like little others do . ProtagonistA was covered in dirt and ProtagonistA's clothes were ripped and tattered . ProtagonistA's hair was matted and ProtagonistA had bruises all over ProtagonistA's body . ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA had been through a war . ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA had been through abuse , both physical and mental . ProtagonistA had been through abandonment and betrayal . ProtagonistA had been through heartbreak and loss . ProtagonistA had been through hell , and ProtagonistA had come out the other side . ProtagonistA was a survivor . ProtagonistA was strong and resilient . ProtagonistA had been through more than most people could even imagine , and yet ProtagonistA was still standing . ProtagonistA was a fighter , and ProtagonistA was not going to give up . ProtagonistA was going to make it through this . ProtagonistA was going to make it through whatever life threw at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was going to survive . 
ProtagonistA stood on the doorstep of ProtagonistA's house , watching as ProtagonistA's husband , Major Rufus James Alberts , drove into the town with his wife . ProtagonistA felt a pang of jealousy as ProtagonistA watched them drive away , but ProtagonistA quickly pushed it aside . After all , ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's own life to live . ProtagonistA turned and went back into the house , ProtagonistA's mind already busy with other things .

From the time of its beginnings , the story of the Tudor house has been told in many different ways . Some say that the house was built on the site of an ancient Roman villa .

ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's heir , the Princess Mrs. Victoria , were the last occupants of the house . Victoria died in 1887 , and ProtagonistA died in 1901 . After their deaths , the house was sold to a private buyer . It has changed hands many times since then , but it remains a beautiful and historic landmark .

ProtagonistA used to love ProtagonistA's boots , but they were as old as the southern mud and ProtagonistA hated the way they made ProtagonistA's feet feel so frail . One day , ProtagonistA was out in the field , working on the farm , when ProtagonistA felt something snap in ProtagonistA's boot . ProtagonistA took it off to find that the sole had completely come off . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't go into town like this , so ProtagonistA had to make do with what ProtagonistA had . ProtagonistA wrapped ProtagonistA's feet in some old rags and tied them up with string . It was n't the most comfortable thing , but it would have to do until ProtagonistA could get new boots . 
ProtagonistA was a little over a mile away , head down , arms rolled in ProtagonistA's lap . ProtagonistA was walking home from ProtagonistA's friend 's house , where ProtagonistA had spent the night . It was a long walk , but ProtagonistA did n't mind . ProtagonistA liked the peace and quiet of the journey . As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's life and what ProtagonistA wanted to do with it . ProtagonistA had always been a good student , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA wanted to go to college . ProtagonistA loved art and wanted to be an artist , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA was good enough . ProtagonistA had a lot of thinking to do . 
Over the last three years , when I have been able to visit the house where ProtagonistA fathomed ProtagonistA's dreams , ProtagonistA has changed little . The same dreamy look is in ProtagonistA's eyes , and ProtagonistA still loves to sit by the window and watch the world go by . ProtagonistA has told me that ProtagonistA sometimes still dreams of ProtagonistA's adventures in Wonderland , and I know that ProtagonistA will never forget the day that ProtagonistA fell down the rabbit hole . I am glad that ProtagonistA has kept ProtagonistA's childlike wonder , and I hope that ProtagonistA never loses it . 
ProtagonistA was walking home from ProtagonistA's job at the local grocery store when ProtagonistA saw a group of kids huddled around something in the alley . ProtagonistA approached them and saw that they were looking at a dead cat .  Nothing good ever happens without a cause ,  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's voice dripping with sarcasm .  You killed that cat , did n't you ?  The kids all denied it , but ProtagonistA did n't believe them . ProtagonistA knew they were up to no good . 
ProtagonistA's life changed the day ProtagonistB died . If ProtagonistA had known ProtagonistB was going to die , ProtagonistA could have prevented it . But ProtagonistA did n't know and ProtagonistB died in a car accident . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA blamed ProtagonistA for not knowing and for not being able to save ProtagonistB . But then something strange happened . ProtagonistA began to notice that ProtagonistA was n't aging . ProtagonistA was still the same age as ProtagonistA was when ProtagonistB died . And then ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was immortal . ProtagonistA was scared at first , but then ProtagonistA realized that this was a gift . ProtagonistA could now live forever and see the world change . ProtagonistA could also help people and make a difference in the world . ProtagonistA is now living ProtagonistA's life to the fullest and enjoying every moment . ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA has been given a gift and ProtagonistA is using it to make the world a better place . 
ProtagonistA was always the vain one , always worrying about ProtagonistA's appearance and what others thought of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB , was always the more level - headed one , and ProtagonistB always tried to keep ProtagonistA in check . So when the court papers dated May 6 , 1795 showed that ProtagonistB had put the cookery of ProtagonistA on ice , in order to prevent any further vanity , ProtagonistA knew that it was time to change ProtagonistA's ways . ProtagonistA started to pay more attention to ProtagonistA's inner self , and less to ProtagonistA's outward appearance . ProtagonistA stopped caring about what others thought of ProtagonistA , and started living ProtagonistA's life for ProtagonistA . It was a hard road , but with ProtagonistB's help , ProtagonistA eventually found true happiness from within . 
ProtagonistA was walking towards the door of ProtagonistA's room , shaking ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA had just had a fight with ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA was still really upset . ProtagonistA was about to go into ProtagonistA's room and slam the door when ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB , walking towards ProtagonistA . Hi , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA walking home and ProtagonistB just wanted to make sure ProtagonistA 're okay . ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA were upset about something . ProtagonistA sighed and told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's fight with ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB listened and then gave ProtagonistA some advice . I'm sure ProtagonistC did n't mean to hurt ProtagonistA's feelings ,  ProtagonistB said .  Why do n't ProtagonistA go talk to ProtagonistC and see if ProtagonistA can work things ProtagonistA thought about what ProtagonistB said and ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistB was right . ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistC's house and they talked things out . Now everything was back to normal between them . 
ProtagonistA stood there , though ProtagonistA was not quite sure why . ProtagonistA had been walking in the park when ProtagonistA saw the rabbit and followed it down the hole . Now ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a strange place with strange creatures . ProtagonistA was n't sure what to do . Then ProtagonistA saw the cat and it seemed to be grinning at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA decided to follow it . 
The little housemaids had delighted in guessing where ProtagonistA might be , using the antique raven as their guide . Now , the raven was perched atop the masthead of the silver boat that carried ProtagonistA to the small town of Bucklemore . It was as if the bird was guiding ProtagonistA on ProtagonistA's journey . ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and excitement as ProtagonistA sailed towards ProtagonistA's destination . ProtagonistA knew that , whatever awaited ProtagonistA in Bucklemore , it would be an adventure . 
In the year 1358 , during the reign of King Edward the First , was born ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was the daughter of a nobleman and grew up in a wealthy household . When ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB and they had two children . ProtagonistA was a kind and loving mother , but ProtagonistA was also a very strong woman . ProtagonistA was not afraid to speak ProtagonistA's mind , and ProtagonistA often did so in ProtagonistB's presence . ProtagonistB was a good man , but ProtagonistB was also a very proud one . ProtagonistB did not like it when ProtagonistA spoke ProtagonistA's mind , and ProtagonistB often told ProtagonistA to be quiet . This made ProtagonistA very angry , and ProtagonistA would often argue with ProtagonistB . However , ProtagonistA always managed to keep ProtagonistA's temper in check . One day , ProtagonistB was away on business , and ProtagonistA was left at home with ProtagonistA's two children . ProtagonistA was very bored , and ProtagonistA decided to go for a walk . As ProtagonistA was walking , ProtagonistA came across a group of peasants who were having a picnic . ProtagonistA stopped to talk to them , and ProtagonistA soon became friends with them . ProtagonistB was not happy when ProtagonistB found out that ProtagonistA had been talking to peasants . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was not to associate with them anymore , and ProtagonistB forbade ProtagonistA from going near them . This made ProtagonistA very angry , and ProtagonistA decided to defy ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA continued to meet with ProtagonistA's new friends , and ProtagonistA even started to teach them how to read and write . ProtagonistB was furious when ProtagonistB found out what ProtagonistA was doing . ProtagonistB demanded that ProtagonistA stop , but ProtagonistA refused . ProtagonistB then threatened to divorce ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA still refused . Finally , ProtagonistB made good on ProtagonistB's threat , and ProtagonistB divorced ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was now a single mother , but ProtagonistA was not afraid . ProtagonistA continued to meet with ProtagonistA's friends , and ProtagonistA even started a school for them . ProtagonistA taught them how to read and write , and ProtagonistA also taught them about the world . ProtagonistA wanted them to be able to make their own decisions , and ProtagonistA wanted them to be able to think for themselves . ProtagonistA's story is an inspirational one , and it shows that it is never too late to learn . ProtagonistA is an example of a strong and independent woman , and ProtagonistA is an example to all women who want to make a difference in the world . 
ProtagonistA was grateful when they let ProtagonistA stay longer in the room . ProtagonistA felt like a piece of luggage that was being stored away for safekeeping . ProtagonistA was happy to have a place to stay , even if it was just for a little while . ProtagonistA knew that eventually ProtagonistA would have to leave , but ProtagonistA was thankful for the time ProtagonistA had . 
 It 's a pity to see ProtagonistA's head , ProtagonistA's wife , all throbbing and squirmy , ProtagonistA's eyes so half - closed ,  said ProtagonistB in ProtagonistB's sweetest voice .  ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA not to drink so much wine , but ProtagonistA would n't listen to ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA's head was indeed throbbing and squirmy , and ProtagonistA's eyes were only half - open . ProtagonistA tried to speak , but ProtagonistA's words were slurred and incomprehensible .  ProtagonistA 'm so sorry , ProtagonistA's love ,  ProtagonistA said finally .  Please forgive ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head and walked away , leaving ProtagonistA alone with ProtagonistA's throbbing head and squirming stomach . 
ProtagonistA had finally decided to carve a story for ProtagonistB . It had been two years since ProtagonistB's death , and ProtagonistA felt it was time to tell their story . ProtagonistA began carving into the wood , telling the story of how they met , their life together , and how ProtagonistB's death had affected ProtagonistA . As ProtagonistA carved , ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistB's presence with ProtagonistA , and it brought ProtagonistA's comfort . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was listening , and that ProtagonistB would always be with ProtagonistA . 
In truth , for all the things ProtagonistA had , no one expected ProtagonistA to be a mother . ProtagonistA was always so independent and carefree . But when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , everything changed . ProtagonistA suddenly saw the potential for a life with ProtagonistB - a life with love and laughter and happiness . And when they found out they were expecting a baby , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was ready to be a mother . ProtagonistA was ready to give ProtagonistA's child everything ProtagonistA never had . ProtagonistA was ready to love unconditionally . 
ProtagonistA has been acting like a mother ever since I left . ProtagonistA put a few things in ProtagonistA's mouth and ProtagonistA 's gone very much as a mother . ProtagonistA 's always been there for me , even when I was a little girl . I remember when I was five , I wanted to go to the park by myself . My mom said no , but ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA would take me . ProtagonistA held my hand the whole time and made sure I was safe . I know ProtagonistA 's always been there for me , even when I did n't realize it . Now , I ca n't imagine my life without ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 's my rock , my protector , and my best friend . 
ProtagonistA was four years old when ProtagonistA heard the news that ProtagonistA's father had been murdered . ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's room , playing with ProtagonistA's dolls when ProtagonistA's mother came in and told ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't understand what it meant at first , but ProtagonistA could see the pain in ProtagonistA's mother 's eyes . Over the next few days , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's mother crying a lot and ProtagonistA began to understand that ProtagonistA's father was never coming back . ProtagonistA was sad and scared , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to be strong for ProtagonistA's mother . 
ProtagonistA's family had always been a bit suspicious of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always so quiet and withdrawn , never really engaging with them . So when ProtagonistA came to them one day and said ProtagonistA was someone else entirely , they did n't believe ProtagonistA . They thought ProtagonistA was just acting out , trying to get attention . But ProtagonistA was insistent . ProtagonistA showed them pictures and videos of ProtagonistA's life as this other person . ProtagonistA told them about the things ProtagonistA had done and seen . Slowly , but surely , ProtagonistA's family began to believe ProtagonistA . And they were happy for ProtagonistA , that ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's true self . 
ProtagonistA , partook of the Professor 's tea , an infusion of which was prepared for ProtagonistA by the hand of the cook of the kitchen . It was a most delicious tea , and ProtagonistA was soon lost in thought , wondering what sort of adventures ProtagonistA might have if ProtagonistA drank more of it . 
ProtagonistA stood on the beach , ProtagonistA's face blackened with the blood of many a dead human . ProtagonistA had been fighting in the war for years , and ProtagonistA had seen and done things that ProtagonistA never thought possible . But , ProtagonistA had never seen anything like this . The sea was crashing against the shore , and the bodies of ProtagonistA's fellow soldiers were floating in the water . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA just stood there , looking at the carnage around ProtagonistA . 
It was Sunday morning when ProtagonistA came into the living room of ProtagonistA's house in the Avenue of the Thames . ProtagonistA looked around at the empty room and the sunlight streaming in through the windows . ProtagonistA felt a sudden urge to go for a walk . ProtagonistA went to the closet and got ProtagonistA's coat and scarf and headed out the door . As ProtagonistA walked down the street , ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and happiness . ProtagonistA walked for a long time , enjoying the fresh air and the sights and sounds of the city . Eventually , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA at St. Paul 's Cathedral . ProtagonistA went inside and sat down in a pew . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and prayed . When ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes , ProtagonistA felt a sense of calm and peace . ProtagonistA got up and walked out of the cathedral . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would always remember this day . 
ProtagonistA was in a deep sleep when ProtagonistA heard the words  ProtagonistB is dead .  ProtagonistA slowly opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw ProtagonistB's dead body next to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA started to scream as ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was going to be next . 
ProtagonistA climbed down into the water , where ProtagonistA had been stripped of all ProtagonistA's clothing , and stood there , ProtagonistA's mind reeling . ProtagonistA had no idea what was going on , or why ProtagonistA was here . The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was going to bed , and then ProtagonistA woke up here . ProtagonistA looked around , trying to find some sort of clue as to what was going on , but there was nothing . ProtagonistA was completely alone . ProtagonistA started to feel panicky . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do or where to go . ProtagonistA started to swim around , hoping to find some sort of land or something , but ProtagonistA did n't . It was just endless water . ProtagonistA started to tire , and ProtagonistA's panic turned into despair . ProtagonistA did n't know how long ProtagonistA had been swimming , but it felt like forever . ProtagonistA was so tired , and ProtagonistA could n't go on any longer . ProtagonistA started to sink , ProtagonistA's body giving up on ProtagonistA . As ProtagonistA sunk down into the water , ProtagonistA saw a light . It was getting brighter and brighter , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA being pulled towards it . ProtagonistA did n't know what was happening , but ProtagonistA did n't fight it . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA being enveloped in the light , and then ProtagonistA was gone . 
The first time ProtagonistB pulled ProtagonistA out of the park , ProtagonistA was in a tangle of newts , ProtagonistA's body in full view of the other newts . ProtagonistA was embarrassed and tried to cover ProtagonistA up , but ProtagonistB just laughed and said ProtagonistA was beautiful . ProtagonistA blushed and looked down , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel flattered . 
ProtagonistA was frowning when ProtagonistA heard the blast , but ProtagonistA had n't seen anything yet . ProtagonistA was getting ready for bed when ProtagonistA heard it . ProtagonistA thought it was just a car backfiring , but when ProtagonistA looked out the window , ProtagonistA saw the flames . ProtagonistA's heart sank when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA's house was on fire . ProtagonistA quickly got dressed and grabbed ProtagonistA's purse , but ProtagonistA could n't find ProtagonistA's keys . ProtagonistA started to panic when ProtagonistA realized they were probably in the house . ProtagonistA tried to go back in , but the flames were too big . ProtagonistA started to cry when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA was going to lose everything . 
ProtagonistA leaned into the glow of the fire , ProtagonistA's hands clasped behind ProtagonistA . It should be fine , Dr. Sandor . ProtagonistA know exactly what she'm doing . ProtagonistA 'd been planning this for weeks , maybe even months . ProtagonistA had it all worked out in ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA had to do . But now , as ProtagonistA sat in front of the fire , ProtagonistA began to doubt ProtagonistA . What if ProtagonistA was making a mistake ? What if ProtagonistA could n't go through with it?No , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had to do this . ProtagonistA could n't back out now . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and steeled ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA would do this . ProtagonistA would not fail . 
The air in the room in which ProtagonistA , before every other girl in ProtagonistA's family , had been married , was of a clear , clear water , free from the mists of the night . It was a room that had been in ProtagonistA's family for generations , and it was said that the air in that room had the power to bring good luck to those who were married in it . And so , on that fateful day , ProtagonistA became the latest in a long line of brides to be married in that room . ProtagonistA could feel the weight of history on ProtagonistA's shoulders as ProtagonistA walked down the aisle , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would be creating new memories for ProtagonistA's own children and grandchildren to look back on one day . As ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's hand and pledged ProtagonistA's life to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and contentment settle over ProtagonistA . This was ProtagonistA's home , and this was where ProtagonistA belonged . 
Before ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistA's life to be the best it could be , and ProtagonistA knew that it would only be the best possible if ProtagonistA made it that way . ProtagonistA was determined to live ProtagonistA's life to the fullest and make every moment count . ProtagonistA wanted to be a role model for ProtagonistA's children and grandchildren , and ProtagonistA wanted to leave a legacy of love and happiness . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to make the most of ProtagonistA's time , and ProtagonistA did just that . ProtagonistA was an amazing wife , mother , grandmother , and friend , and ProtagonistA will be missed by all who knew ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB for the first time when ProtagonistA was eleven years old . ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB was really cute , but was too shy to say anything . They ended up becoming good friends and would often talk and hang out together . When ProtagonistA turned eighteen , ProtagonistA finally mustered up the courage to tell ProtagonistB how ProtagonistA felt about ProtagonistB . It turns out , ProtagonistB felt the same way about ProtagonistA and they ended up dating . They 've been together for five years now and are very happy . 
ProtagonistA never knew the difference between December and any other month . To ProtagonistA , they were all the same . ProtagonistA would go to church every Sunday , sit in the same pew , and sing the same songs . ProtagonistA never complained , because ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life . One day , ProtagonistA went to church and saw that the pews were empty . ProtagonistA thought that maybe everyone was just late , so ProtagonistA sat down and waited . After a few minutes , ProtagonistA realized that no one was coming . ProtagonistA got up and walked to the front of the church , where ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB packing up ProtagonistB's things . Father , where is everyone ?  ProtagonistA asked . I'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but there is no one here . The parish has been closed down . ProtagonistA was confused . ProtagonistA did n't understand what was happening . ProtagonistA had been coming to this church ProtagonistA's whole life , and now it was gone . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could come and live with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA never forgot the church that ProtagonistA loved , but ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's new life . 
ProtagonistA stood before ProtagonistB , and the breath was stilled before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it . ProtagonistB was huge ! ProtagonistB's muscles rippled under ProtagonistB's skin , and ProtagonistB's eyes burned with a fierce intensity . ProtagonistA could feel the power emanating from ProtagonistB , and it was both exhilarating and terrifying . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB could crush ProtagonistA like a grape if ProtagonistB wanted to , and the thought made ProtagonistA's heart race . But ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistB would never hurt ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA could see the gentleness in ProtagonistB's eyes , and the way ProtagonistB's whole body was relaxed . ProtagonistB was like a lion who had been tamed , and ProtagonistA felt safe in ProtagonistB's presence . They stared at each other for a long moment , and then ProtagonistB spoke . ProtagonistB have been waiting for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistA would come . ProtagonistB voice was like thunder , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's knees tremble . But ProtagonistA stood ProtagonistA's ground and met ProtagonistB's gaze . Who are ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked . ProtagonistB am the Guardian of this place . It is ProtagonistB's duty to protect those who enter . And why do ProtagonistB need to protect me?Because ProtagonistA are special , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA have a destiny to fulfill . ProtagonistA did n't know what to say to that , so ProtagonistA just stood there and looked at ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA must be tired after ProtagonistA's journey . Come , sit down and rest . ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA to a nearby tree and ProtagonistA sat down . ProtagonistB sat down next to ProtagonistA and they looked at each other for a long time . Finally , ProtagonistA spoke . Thank ProtagonistB for protecting ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA do n't know what ProtagonistA's destiny is , but ProtagonistA will trust ProtagonistB . And with that , ProtagonistA fell into a deep sleep . 
ProtagonistA had always been a powerful witch . ProtagonistA was respected by many in the wizarding world and ProtagonistA's courtship was highly sought after . However , ProtagonistA's son 's death ended ProtagonistA's courtship and left ProtagonistA heartbroken . ProtagonistA was never the same after that . ProtagonistA became a recluse and spent ProtagonistA's days mourning ProtagonistA's son . 
ProtagonistA was a very curious girl . ProtagonistA always wanted to know what was around the next corner . So , when ProtagonistA saw a door that ProtagonistA had never seen before , ProtagonistA just had to go through it . ProtagonistA did n't know what was on the other side , but ProtagonistA was excited to find out . As ProtagonistA walked through the door , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a very strange place . The walls were all curved , and the floor was uneven . ProtagonistA's face grew larger as ProtagonistA walked , and ProtagonistA's shoulders were more than a foot above the floor . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a giant 's house . As ProtagonistA continued to explore , ProtagonistA found more and more odd things . Furniture that was too big for ProtagonistA , food that was too big for ProtagonistA , and even a cat that was as big as ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it before . Eventually , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's way back to the door ProtagonistA had come in . As ProtagonistA walked through , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA back in ProtagonistA's own house . ProtagonistA was surprised to find that everything was back to normal size . ProtagonistA was n't sure what to make of ProtagonistA's experience . Was it all just a dream ? Or had ProtagonistA really been in a giant 's house ? ProtagonistA was n't sure , but one thing was for sure . ProtagonistA was definitely curious to find out . 
Fourteen years ago , when ProtagonistA was conducting ProtagonistA's last examination of ProtagonistA's patients , ProtagonistA had an idea of what might befall ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was not sure what it was , but ProtagonistA knew it would be something terrible . And so it was . ProtagonistB was found dead in ProtagonistB's bed , with ProtagonistB's eyes wide open and a look of terror on ProtagonistB's face . It is said that ProtagonistA knew what would happen , and ProtagonistA tried to warn ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB would not listen . 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw a group of people huddled together in a doorway . ProtagonistA approached them and asked if they were okay . They told ProtagonistA they were homeless and had nowhere to go . ProtagonistA was outraged . ProtagonistA asked them why the government was n't doing anything to help them . They told ProtagonistA that the government did n't care about them . ProtagonistA promised them that ProtagonistA would do something to help them . ProtagonistA went to the nearest store and bought them some food and blankets . ProtagonistA then went to the city hall and demanded to speak to someone about the situation . ProtagonistA was told that the government was aware of the problem and was working on a solution . ProtagonistA was satisfied and went home . 
There was once ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always very adventurous , and loved to explore the world around ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB . Without hesitation , ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB down a rabbit hole , and found ProtagonistA in a place ProtagonistA had never seen before . ProtagonistA was amazed by all the new sights and sounds , and could n't wait to explore more of this new world . 
ProtagonistA was a very pretty girl , with dark hair which fell to ProtagonistA's shoulders , a light complexion , strong eyebrows and a shining face . ProtagonistA was very popular at school and had many friends . One day , ProtagonistA was walking home from school with ProtagonistA's friends when they saw a group of boys throwing stones at a cat . ProtagonistA's friends ran away , but ProtagonistA ran towards the boys and stopped them from harming the cat . The boys were very angry and started to chase ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA ran as fast as ProtagonistA could and managed to lose them . When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA was out of breath and ProtagonistA's heart was pounding . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had done the right thing , but ProtagonistA was also very scared . 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the bed , and ProtagonistA looked up at the ceiling with a trembling hand . ProtagonistA was trying to process what had just happened , but ProtagonistA could n't believe it . ProtagonistA had just been raped . ProtagonistA felt dirty and violated , and ProtagonistA wanted to take a shower but ProtagonistA was afraid that if ProtagonistA moved , the pain would get worse . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a nightmare , and ProtagonistA wished that ProtagonistA would wake up . But ProtagonistA knew that this was reality , and ProtagonistA had to face it . ProtagonistA was scared and alone , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . 
It was about that day that ProtagonistA finally said goodbye to ProtagonistB and child . ProtagonistA had been planning to do it for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had found out that ProtagonistB had been cheating on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had packed ProtagonistA's bags and made all the arrangements , and now all ProtagonistA had to do was say the words . ProtagonistA walked into the living room where ProtagonistB and child were watching TV and sat down next to them . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and said ,  ProtagonistA 'm leaving you . ProtagonistA 'm taking the child with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was stunned . ProtagonistB could n't believe that ProtagonistA was really doing this . ProtagonistB begged ProtagonistA to stay , but ProtagonistA was resolute . ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things and ProtagonistA's child 's things and left the house . It was a difficult decision , but ProtagonistA knew it was the right thing to do . ProtagonistA was finally free from ProtagonistA's unhappy marriage and could start fresh with ProtagonistA's child . 
The first time I saw ProtagonistA ProtagonistA was in a corridor of the saloon of the house on Heffernan Street , in the midst of Barnes ' Market . I was struck by ProtagonistA's beauty , but it was ProtagonistA's eyes that really caught my attention . They were a deep blue , almost violet , and they seemed to look right into my soul . I could tell that ProtagonistA was a kind and caring person , and I knew that I wanted to get to know ProtagonistA better . I introduced myself , and we began talking . I soon found out that ProtagonistA was a widow , and that ProtagonistA was looking for a new place to live . I offered to help ProtagonistA find a place , and ProtagonistA accepted . We spent the next few days looking at different properties , but none of them seemed quite right . Finally , I suggested that ProtagonistA move in with me , and ProtagonistA agreed . We've been living together for six months now , and I ca n't imagine my life without ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 's my best friend , and I know that I will always love ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with big , blue eyes and ProtagonistA felt a sudden surge of maternal instinct . ProtagonistA scooped ProtagonistB up and took ProtagonistB home , despite the protests of ProtagonistA's husband . They named ProtagonistB Stripes and ProtagonistB quickly became a part of the family . ProtagonistB looked so much like ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA's husband often joked that ProtagonistB was really ProtagonistA's son . As ProtagonistB grew , ProtagonistB began to look more and more like a man . By the time ProtagonistB was five inches tall , ProtagonistB looked exactly like ProtagonistA's husband . This caused some tension in the family , but they all loved ProtagonistB and accepted ProtagonistB as one of their own . One day , when ProtagonistB was five inches long , ProtagonistB ran away from home . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's husband searched for ProtagonistB for days , but they never found ProtagonistB . They always wondered what happened to ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA has been a part of our lives for as long as we can remember . ProtagonistA 's been in every picture book , every movie , and every TV show . We all know ProtagonistA's story by heart . But how did ProtagonistA come to be?No one knows for sure , but the most popular theory is that ProtagonistA was created by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a mathematician and a writer , and ProtagonistB was fascinated by children . ProtagonistB would often take them on boat rides and tell them stories . One day , ProtagonistB told a story about ProtagonistA . The children loved it so much that they begged ProtagonistB to write it down . And so ProtagonistB did . The picture of ProtagonistA that we all know and love was drawn by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB wanted to make sure that ProtagonistA looked exactly like the children ProtagonistB had told the story to . ProtagonistA has been a part of our lives for over 150 years now . ProtagonistA has been through all sorts of adventures , and ProtagonistA always manages to come out on top . ProtagonistA is a symbol of hope and resilience , and we will always love ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was going to have to kill ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA said , sitting on the arm of the chair and looking into ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly , but ProtagonistA could n't let ProtagonistB live knowing what ProtagonistA knew . It was better for ProtagonistB to die now , before it was too late . 
ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's early twenty - first year , had , in fact , the least to do , of all ProtagonistB's ladies of ProtagonistA's age , in the establishment of a palace for them at the point where the river Styx flows into the Thrym - yard . The other ladies , all older and more experienced , took charge of the construction , while ProtagonistA was given the task of supervising the servants and making sure the palace ran smoothly . ProtagonistA did n't mind , though ; ProtagonistA was happy to have a place in ProtagonistB's court , and ProtagonistA enjoyed the challenge of keeping everything running smoothly . One day , ProtagonistA was walking through the palace grounds when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the river . ProtagonistA went to investigate and saw a beautiful golden fish swimming upstream . It was struggling against the current , and ProtagonistA could see that it was exhausted . ProtagonistA quickly scooped it up in ProtagonistA's net and brought it to the palace , where ProtagonistA put it in a tank of fresh water . The fish was so grateful to ProtagonistA for saving its life , and it soon became clear that it had magical powers . It granted ProtagonistA three wishes , and ProtagonistA used them wisely . First , ProtagonistA wished for the palace to be finished so that ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's ladies would have a comfortable home . Second , ProtagonistA wished for the servants to be well - trained and efficient , so that the palace would run like a well - oiled machine . And third , ProtagonistA wished for a never - ending supply of fresh fish for the tank . The fish 's magical powers had transformed the palace into a beautiful and luxurious home , and ProtagonistA was proud to have played a part in it . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's ladies would be happy there for many years to come . 
In the museum of ancient things , high above the city , the great city of Diagona , ProtagonistA lies , ProtagonistA's body neatly folded in ProtagonistA's lap . ProtagonistA is the only one who knows the secret of the museum . The secret is that the museum is actually a portal to another world . ProtagonistA discovered this when ProtagonistA was just a child . ProtagonistA would come to the museum and sit in front of the portal , and soon ProtagonistA would be transported to another world . ProtagonistA has been to many different worlds , and ProtagonistA has even made some friends in those worlds . But one day , ProtagonistA went to a world that was very different from all the others . This world was dark and full of monsters . ProtagonistA was scared , and ProtagonistA tried to run away , but the monsters were too fast . They caught ProtagonistA and dragged ProtagonistA into the darkness . ProtagonistA does n't know what happened to ProtagonistA after that . ProtagonistA woke up in the museum , back in ProtagonistA's own world . But ProtagonistA was different now . ProtagonistA was older , and ProtagonistA had a feeling that ProtagonistA had been to that dark world before . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to go back and find ProtagonistA's friends . But first , ProtagonistA had to tell the secret of the museum to someone . 
ProtagonistA was born and ProtagonistA was a boy , but ProtagonistA looked as if ProtagonistA had been shot . The doctors said that there was nothing wrong with ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA knew that something was wrong . ProtagonistA could n't help but feel different from all the other boys and girls . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do or where to go . One day , ProtagonistA ran away from home . ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to find out who ProtagonistA really was . ProtagonistA ended up at a small cabin in the woods . It was there that ProtagonistA met a woman who told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was a witch . The woman said that ProtagonistA had the power to change ProtagonistA's form into any creature that ProtagonistA wanted . ProtagonistA was skeptical at first , but ProtagonistA decided to try it out . ProtagonistA turned into a bird and flew away . ProtagonistA felt free for the first time in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could never go back to being a boy , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA was finally happy and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never be alone again . 
ProtagonistA was living a happy life , enjoying ProtagonistA's summer holidays with ProtagonistA's family and friends . ProtagonistA loved spending time with ProtagonistA's loved ones , and ProtagonistA cherished every moment ProtagonistA had with them . One day , while ProtagonistA was out playing with ProtagonistA's friends , ProtagonistA suddenly felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's chest . ProtagonistA clutched at ProtagonistA's chest and collapsed to the ground . ProtagonistA's friends rushed to ProtagonistA's side , but it was too late . ProtagonistA was gone . 
ProtagonistA woke up in ProtagonistA's bed , groggy and disoriented . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had been sleeping for hours , but ProtagonistA did n't know how long ProtagonistA had actually been out . ProtagonistA got out of bed and walked to ProtagonistA's window . When ProtagonistA looked outside , ProtagonistA saw that it was evening . The sky was dark and the stars were shining . And then ProtagonistA heard the church bells ringing . ProtagonistA had never heard them ring so loudly before . ProtagonistA wondered what was going on . ProtagonistA got dressed and went outside to see if ProtagonistA could find out . When ProtagonistA got to the church , ProtagonistA saw that there was a wedding going on . ProtagonistA had never seen a wedding at the church before . ProtagonistA watched as the bride and groom said their vows and then kissed . ProtagonistA felt happy for them . As ProtagonistA was walking back home , ProtagonistA heard the bells ringing again . This time , ProtagonistA knew what they were saying . They were saying that it was time for ProtagonistA to go home . 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB lived along the southern shore of an old lake in one of the smaller coves . ProtagonistA bore a very infamous , rather sordid remembrance of ProtagonistB . One day , while out walking along the shore , ProtagonistA came across a dead body . The body was that of ProtagonistB . There was a note next to the body that said  ProtagonistB 'm sorry  . 
ProtagonistA stood at ProtagonistA's kitchen mirror , as if looking around the room for the first time . ProtagonistA saw the dirty dishes in the sink and the pile of laundry in the corner . ProtagonistA noticed the dust on the shelves and the cobwebs in the corners . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been neglecting ProtagonistA's home and it showed . ProtagonistA made a decision then and there to clean up ProtagonistA's act and start taking better care of ProtagonistA's home . From that day forward , ProtagonistA became a model housekeeper and ProtagonistA's home was always clean and tidy . 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's husband Isaac Davis were like any other young couple in love . They had their ups and downs , but overall , their relationship was strong . They started a family and had two beautiful children . Unfortunately , when the economy took a turn for the worse , they were forced to make some tough decisions . They both lost their jobs and their home was foreclosed on . They were forced to move in with ProtagonistA's parents . It was a difficult time for the family , but they managed to get by . Things finally started to turn around for them when they both found new jobs . They were able to save enough money to buy a new home and they were finally able to start fresh . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bright girl , and ProtagonistA's parents had high hopes for ProtagonistA's future . So when ProtagonistA was accepted into a prestigious boarding school , they were over the moon . ProtagonistA was excited to leave ProtagonistA's small town and start a new chapter in ProtagonistA's life . But ProtagonistA had a secret . ProtagonistA was gifted with a special ability - ProtagonistA could see into the future . ProtagonistA had never told anyone about ProtagonistA's gift , for fear of being labelled a freak . But ProtagonistA knew that there was someone out there who would be interested in ProtagonistA's ability - ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was nervous about meeting ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that it was inevitable . One day , ProtagonistA would have to face ProtagonistB and reveal ProtagonistA's secret . Until then , ProtagonistA would keep ProtagonistA's ability hidden and enjoy ProtagonistA's time at boarding school . 
ProtagonistA died when ProtagonistA's ears were bleeding . It was a tragic accident that could have been avoided . ProtagonistA was at a party and someone turned up the music too loud . The next thing ProtagonistA knew , ProtagonistA was lying on the ground with blood coming out of ProtagonistA's ears . ProtagonistA was rushed to the hospital , but it was too late . ProtagonistA was gone . 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were having lunch at the upper end of the city . It was a beautiful day , and they were enjoying the view of the skyline . ProtagonistB commented on how lucky ProtagonistA was to live in such a beautiful city . ProtagonistA agreed , but said that ProtagonistA sometimes felt like a fish out of water . ProtagonistA missed the small - town feel of ProtagonistA's hometown . ProtagonistB sympathized , but said that ProtagonistB thought the city was exciting and full of opportunity . ProtagonistA nodded , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little homesick . 
Ever since the dark nights of the past , when ProtagonistA had been orphan and immature , and brought to the surface of madness by the combination of innocence with evil , the beautiful , innocent face of ProtagonistA , had been a source of terror to ProtagonistB , and perhaps to ProtagonistA , and one of the most uncertain and troublesome situations of childhood . ProtagonistB had never known what to do with that face , how to protect ProtagonistA from the dangers that it seemed to attract . And so ProtagonistB had always been on ProtagonistB's guard , never letting ProtagonistA out of ProtagonistB's sight for a moment , and never letting ProtagonistA out of the house after dark . But now , ProtagonistA was grown up , and ProtagonistB was no longer with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's own in the world , and ProtagonistA had to face ProtagonistA's fears head on . ProtagonistA had to learn to control the darkness that seemed to well up inside ProtagonistA whenever ProtagonistA thought of those nights long ago . Slowly , ProtagonistA began to venture out after dark , and to ProtagonistA's surprise , nothing happened . The darkness did n't consume ProtagonistA , and the monsters did n't come to get ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA began to feel more confident , and ProtagonistA's green eyes no longer seemed to hold the same terror for ProtagonistA . Eventually , ProtagonistA came to accept that the darkness was a part of ProtagonistA , but it did n't have to control ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was in control now , and ProtagonistA could choose to face the darkness or to turn away from it . ProtagonistA was no longer a scared little girl , and ProtagonistA was no longer alone . 
ProtagonistB had not expected to find ProtagonistA dead . ProtagonistB had been walking in the woods , looking for mushrooms , when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA's body lying on the ground . ProtagonistA was lying on ProtagonistA's back , ProtagonistA's eyes open and staring up at the sky . There was no blood , no signs of violence . It looked as if ProtagonistA had simply lain down and died . ProtagonistB called the police and then sat down to wait . ProtagonistB was in shock , and it was n't until the police arrived that ProtagonistB realized ProtagonistB had been crying . 
The first thing the sun saw when it rose on the first Sunday in June was that glinting spear of ProtagonistA in the distance . ProtagonistA was called Der Runde , and ProtagonistA was the most beautiful thing the sun had ever seen . The sun rose higher in the sky , and the light caught ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA was smiling , and the sun felt its warmth spreading through its body . The sun rose higher still , and the light caught ProtagonistA's hair . It was the color of gold , and it shone like a crown . The sun rose higher and higher , until it was directly overhead . And then , suddenly , ProtagonistA was gone . 
ProtagonistA was a beautiful butterfly who loved to flutter around the Abirondack Mountains . ProtagonistA would often perch on the peaks of the mountains and take in the stunning views . On one particular day , ProtagonistA was enjoying the view from one of the peaks when ProtagonistA suddenly felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's wing . ProtagonistA looked down and saw that ProtagonistA's wing was ripped and ProtagonistA was bleeding . ProtagonistA tried to fly away but ProtagonistA's wing was too damaged . ProtagonistA ended up falling off the peak and into a deep ravine . ProtagonistA lay there for days , helpless and in pain . Eventually , ProtagonistA died from ProtagonistA's injuries . As ProtagonistA lay there dying , ProtagonistA shed ProtagonistA's wings on two of the peaks of the Abirondack Mountains . 
ProtagonistA was a beautiful and purring one , with a bright , clear face and a wary look in ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA was always on the lookout for danger , and ProtagonistA was always ready to protect ProtagonistA's family . One day , ProtagonistA was out walking when ProtagonistA saw a group of dogs coming towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA immediately went into protect mode , and ProtagonistA fought them off until they finally ran away . ProtagonistA's family was very proud of ProtagonistA , and they knew that ProtagonistA would always be there to protect them . 
ProtagonistA was a very old and very wretched woman , and one of the most detestable characters in the country ; but in my opinion , among all women , ProtagonistA was the most infamous . ProtagonistA had been married to a man who was much older than ProtagonistA , and who had died about ten years ago . Since his death ProtagonistA had lived a life of seclusion , and had never been seen by any of ProtagonistA's neighbors . ProtagonistA was a tall , thin woman , with a face that was deeply wrinkled and a complexion that was almost black . ProtagonistA's eyes were small and sharp , and ProtagonistA's mouth was large and coarse . ProtagonistA's hair was white , and ProtagonistA wore it in a long , tangled mass . ProtagonistA was always clothed in black , and ProtagonistA had a way of looking at you that was very unpleasant . 
The ghost of ProtagonistA towered over the room . ProtagonistA was a large , imposing figure , and ProtagonistA's presence was felt by all who entered . ProtagonistA was a woman of great strength and power , and ProtagonistA used ProtagonistA's ghostly form to protect those who could not protect themselves . ProtagonistA was a force to be reckoned with , and ProtagonistA's enemies knew it . 
ProtagonistA is sitting in ProtagonistA's bedroom on a hot summer day in July , trying to decide whether it 's worth while to go to a country inn or an ailing old lady 's house and die in the cold and damp . ProtagonistA 's not sure what to do , but ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA ca n't stay in ProtagonistA's stuffy , hot bedroom any longer . ProtagonistA gets up and goes to the window , looking out at the beautiful day . ProtagonistA sees people walking and biking around and children playing in the park . ProtagonistA hears the sound of laughter and the splashing of water . ProtagonistA suddenly knows what ProtagonistA wants to do . ProtagonistA grabs ProtagonistA's purse and keys and heads out the door , heading for the park . ProtagonistA 's going to enjoy ProtagonistA last day , no matter what happens . 
ProtagonistA had once left a large sum of money and ProtagonistA's house in London for the purpose of making a new life for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had wanted a man who would be faithful to ProtagonistA in the world . ProtagonistA had met many men , but none of them had been the right one . ProtagonistA had almost given up hope , when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was everything ProtagonistA had ever wanted in a man , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be faithful to ProtagonistA . They got married and moved to a small town in the middle of nowhere . It was perfect . They had a beautiful house and a wonderful life . Everything was perfect , until ProtagonistB started cheating on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA had given up everything for ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB had betrayed ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA left ProtagonistB and moved back to London . ProtagonistA never wanted to see ProtagonistB again . 
ProtagonistA was a mother 's lady and ProtagonistA's daughter was the nicest girl in the world . They lived in a small town and everyone knew them . One day , ProtagonistA's daughter went to the store and did n't come back . ProtagonistA went to the store and found ProtagonistA's daughter dead . 
The night ProtagonistA vanished was the night when ProtagonistA shared ProtagonistA's bed with ProtagonistB . It was also the night when ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistB was a vampire . ProtagonistA had always suspected that ProtagonistB was something otherworldly , but ProtagonistA never could have guessed that ProtagonistB was a bloodsucking fiend . When ProtagonistA confronted ProtagonistB about it , ProtagonistB did n't deny it . In fact , ProtagonistB seemed almost proud of it . That 's when ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get away from ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and snuck out while ProtagonistB was sleeping . ProtagonistA 's never looked back since . 
ProtagonistA was having a great day . ProtagonistA learned about the universe and how it worked . ProtagonistA saw the stars and planets moving and was fascinated by it all . Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt something was wrong with ProtagonistA's soul . ProtagonistA did n't know what it was , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to find out . ProtagonistA went on a journey to find the answer and eventually found it . ProtagonistA learned that ProtagonistA's soul was sick because ProtagonistA was living in a world that was full of hate and violence . ProtagonistA decided to change ProtagonistA's ways and make a difference in the world . 
The last time they saw each other , ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's seventh year . It was a cold day and ProtagonistA was bundled up in ProtagonistA's coat , scarf , and gloves . ProtagonistA had just finished ProtagonistA's shift at the factory and was on ProtagonistA's way home when ProtagonistA saw a group of kids playing in the snow . ProtagonistB , was trying to build a snowman but was having trouble . ProtagonistA stopped to help ProtagonistB , and when ProtagonistA was done , ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a big hug . That was the last time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA never forgot that day , and every year on the anniversary of it , ProtagonistA would go back to that same spot and build a snowman with ProtagonistB . Even when ProtagonistB was no longer a little girl ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB would still come to visit ProtagonistA and help ProtagonistA build the snowman . And every year , they would give each other a big hug . 
ProtagonistA came to my house on Tuesday to tell me the news that ProtagonistB had been admitted into the College of the Holy McPherson Priory . ProtagonistA said that it would be five years before ProtagonistB would be able to see ProtagonistB's aunt . I was very happy for ProtagonistB and I knew that ProtagonistB would be able to get a good education at the college . 
ProtagonistA had been feeling off for weeks . ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that something was wrong , but ProtagonistA could n't put ProtagonistA's finger on what it was . ProtagonistA's headache had been getting worse and worse , to the point where ProtagonistA could barely function . And then , one day , ProtagonistA woke up to find that three inches of ProtagonistA's nose was gone . ProtagonistA panicked , of course , but ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA could n't go to the hospital , because ProtagonistA did n't want to explain what had happened . And ProtagonistA could n't just leave it as it was . So ProtagonistA did the only thing ProtagonistA could think of : ProtagonistA went to a plastic surgeon and had them fix ProtagonistA's nose . It was n't perfect , but it was the best ProtagonistA could do . 
ProtagonistA was in the kitchen about that time , knitting a scarf for ProtagonistB , when ProtagonistA noticed a shadow sitting on the table . It was a small shadow , about the size of a mouse , and it had a curious look on its face . ProtagonistA had never seen a shadow like this before , and ProtagonistA was wondering what it was doing in ProtagonistA's kitchen . The shadow seemed to be looking around the kitchen , as if it were looking for something . After a few minutes , it got up from the table and started to explore the rest of the room . ProtagonistA watched it for a while , but ProtagonistA soon got back to ProtagonistA's knitting . A few minutes later , ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the living room . It sounded like something was knocking over furniture . ProtagonistA got up to see what was going on and found the shadow in the living room , knocking over a lamp . Hey ! What are you doing ?  ProtagonistA exclaimed . The shadow turned to look at ProtagonistA and then ran out the door . ProtagonistA chased it , but it was too fast for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA lost sight of it and it was gone . ProtagonistA was bewildered by what had just happened . ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it before . ProtagonistA was about to go back to the living room to clean up the mess when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB coming home . ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm home !  ProtagonistB called out . I'm in the kitchen !  ProtagonistA replied . ProtagonistA quickly finished knitting the scarf and went to meet ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA did n't mention the shadow to ProtagonistB , as ProtagonistA was n't sure what to make of it . Maybe it was just a strange coincidence and ProtagonistA would never see it again . 
On Tuesday , Mr. Bligh came to me at home with the news that ProtagonistA had been admitted into the College of the Holy - McPherson Priory , and that it would be five years before ProtagonistA would be able to see ProtagonistA's aunt . I was so happy for ProtagonistA , but I knew that it would be hard for ProtagonistA to be away from ProtagonistA's family for so long . Mr. Bligh said that the College would take good care of ProtagonistA and that ProtagonistA would have everything ProtagonistA needed . I thanked Mr. Bligh for his help in getting ProtagonistA into the College and for his kind words . 
ProtagonistA's husband had died eight days ago , and ProtagonistA was still in mourning . ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's parlor , chatting with ProtagonistA's neighbor , when ProtagonistA suddenly remembered that ProtagonistA had to choose a subject of conversation for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA decided to ask ProtagonistB about the world 's greatest chocolate connoisseur of the nineteenth century , Mr. Belvedere of the Parisian street fly - and - supplies , Dr. John Quartermaster - of - the - ship - whale Squadron Heterozone of the Navy , and indeed the world - famous spectacles - in - the - air . Just as ProtagonistA was about to begin ProtagonistA's inquiry , ProtagonistA heard a loud banging on ProtagonistA's door . ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and found ProtagonistC standing there , brandishing a revolver . ProtagonistC shouted at ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC am coming to murder ProtagonistA ! Go away , ProtagonistA was terrified . ProtagonistA slammed the door shut and ran to the nearest telephone to call the police . When they arrived , they found ProtagonistC still outside , ranting and raving . They took ProtagonistC away and ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief . 
The first time I had the good fortune to see ProtagonistA grow old , ProtagonistA was as beautiful as a goddess . ProtagonistA's hair was silver and ProtagonistA's skin was as smooth as porcelain . ProtagonistA was wearing a white dress that flowed around ProtagonistA like a cloud . ProtagonistA was so beautiful that I could n't take my eyes off ProtagonistA . I felt like I was in the presence of royalty . ProtagonistA was kind and wise , and I felt honored to be able to talk to ProtagonistA . I will never forget that day , and I will always cherish the memories I have of ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had just moved to a new town and was starting ProtagonistA's first day of school . ProtagonistA was feeling nervous and out of place when ProtagonistA saw a group of kids laughing and pointing at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA tried to ignore them , but ProtagonistA could feel the tears welling up in ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA was about to turn and run away when ProtagonistA heard someone call ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as Harry and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would be ProtagonistA's friend . From that day forward , ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA laugh when ProtagonistA was feeling down and helped ProtagonistA adjust to ProtagonistA's new life . ProtagonistA will always be grateful to ProtagonistB for being ProtagonistA's friend when ProtagonistA needed it most . 
It was a cold , wind - shrouded morning when ProtagonistA tucked me into bed , one full of the dread of the future , and ProtagonistA's own worries , and put ProtagonistA's trust and faith in me . ProtagonistA knew that I would have to face the world alone , and that I would need all the strength I could muster . ProtagonistA also knew that I would find a way to make it through , because I was strong enough to weather any storm . 
ProtagonistA was getting fed up with ProtagonistB constantly calling ProtagonistA  Madam .  ProtagonistA knew it was meant as a term of respect , but it made ProtagonistA feel old and stuffy . Finally , ProtagonistA decided to say something . ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would appreciate it if ProtagonistB would stop calling ProtagonistA ' Madam . ' It makes ProtagonistA feel like an old lady . ProtagonistA aunt was taken aback at first , but then ProtagonistB realized how ProtagonistA must feel . Of course , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB 'm sorry if ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA feel uncomfortable . ProtagonistB 'll try to remember to call ProtagonistA by ProtagonistA's name from now on .  
ProtagonistA flung open the white door of ProtagonistA's kitchen and directed the astonished man in the line to the dining room . ProtagonistA had been expecting ProtagonistB all day and was not going to let ProtagonistB get away this time . ProtagonistA had been tracking ProtagonistB's every move and knew that ProtagonistB would be coming to ProtagonistA's house . ProtagonistA was not going to let ProtagonistB get away with what ProtagonistB had done . 
Not long after ProtagonistA was born , ProtagonistA had a dream . In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA was a beautiful butterfly , flitting from flower to flower . ProtagonistA was so happy and free , and ProtagonistA knew that this was what ProtagonistA was meant to do . When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was sad to find that ProtagonistA was just a regular girl , but ProtagonistA was determined to make ProtagonistA's dream come true . ProtagonistA worked hard to learn about butterflies , and eventually ProtagonistA became a world - renowned butterfly expert . ProtagonistA even wrote a book about it ! Now ProtagonistA knows that anything is possible if you believe in yourself and follow your dreams . 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who knew what ProtagonistA wanted in life , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to get it . ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer , and ProtagonistA wanted to be a writer . ProtagonistA had read all the great classics and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could write something just as good , if not better . But ProtagonistA did n't know how to get started . ProtagonistA did n't have any ideas for stories , and ProtagonistA did n't know how to go about getting published . One day , ProtagonistA was walking in the park and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on a bench , writing in a notebook . ProtagonistA went up to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB was writing . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was a writer and that ProtagonistB was working on ProtagonistB's latest novel . ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA was a writer too , and ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that if ProtagonistA wanted to be a writer , ProtagonistA should just start writing . It was that simple . ProtagonistA went home and started writing ProtagonistA's first story . ProtagonistA was a little unsure at first , but ProtagonistA kept going and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA's rhythm . ProtagonistA wrote and wrote until ProtagonistA had a complete story . Then ProtagonistA sent it off to a publisher . ProtagonistA was so excited when ProtagonistA got a letter back saying that they wanted to publish ProtagonistA's story . ProtagonistA was finally a published author . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA wanted to be a writer , and ProtagonistA finally achieved ProtagonistA's dream . 
ProtagonistA was a stranger , and a stranger that ProtagonistA was , if ProtagonistA had been anything like any other woman of flesh or blood . ProtagonistA was different than any other woman that ProtagonistB had ever met . ProtagonistA was beautiful and intriguing , and ProtagonistB could n't help but be drawn to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB wanted to know more about ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB was determined to find out . ProtagonistB would do whatever it took to get to know ProtagonistA better . 
It was a warm day in early June when ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB said their vows . They were surrounded by their closest family and friends , all of whom were beaming with happiness . It was a perfect day . Three months later , ProtagonistA was dead . The cause of death was a complication of pregnancy - something that no one could have predicted or prevented . ProtagonistA had only been married for a short time , but in that time ProtagonistA had been incredibly happy . ProtagonistA's death came as a shock to everyone who knew ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was devastated . ProtagonistB could n't believe that ProtagonistA was gone , and that ProtagonistB would never see ProtagonistA again . The pain was unbearable . ProtagonistA's family and friends were also grieving . They could n't believe that ProtagonistA was gone so soon . It was a tragic event , but everyone who loved ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never be forgotten . 
ProtagonistA was born in a house where the gods took their name from ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistC from the earth . It was a happy home , full of laughter and love . But when ProtagonistA's father died , everything changed . ProtagonistB became a bitter woman , and ProtagonistB began to take ProtagonistB's anger out on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB would beat ProtagonistA and call ProtagonistA's names , making ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistA was nothing . But ProtagonistA was a strong girl , and ProtagonistA refused to let ProtagonistB break ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was named after the gods , and that made ProtagonistA special . And ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistC was named after the earth , and that made ProtagonistC special too . So ProtagonistA held onto ProtagonistA's memories of ProtagonistA's happy childhood , and ProtagonistA used them to keep ProtagonistA going . Even though ProtagonistA's life was hard , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could make it through anything . 
Nearly two hours after ProtagonistA had set out on ProtagonistA's journey to the far - away city of St. Louis , ProtagonistA arrived at the eastern gate of the town . ProtagonistA was relieved to have made it this far , but ProtagonistA's journey was far from over . ProtagonistA still had to find a place to stay for the night and figure out how to get to ProtagonistA's destination . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB for directions to the nearest inn , and ProtagonistB pointed ProtagonistA in the right direction . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and set off down the street . As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA passed by many shops and homes , all of which were bustling with activity . ProtagonistA had never seen a town this big before , and ProtagonistA was feeling a bit overwhelmed . ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistB yell after ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA turned around and saw that ProtagonistB was pointing at a large sign that read  No Entry after Sunset .  ProtagonistA had forgotten all about the curfew ! ProtagonistA quickly thanked ProtagonistB again and rushed to the inn , hoping ProtagonistA would make it there before the curfew . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a rebel . ProtagonistA was never one to follow the crowd and ProtagonistA always marched to the beat of ProtagonistA's own drum . So , when ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's small town in Maine to go to college in Boston , ProtagonistA did n't think twice about it . It was a big city and ProtagonistA was ready for a new adventure . ProtagonistA had never been away from home for more than a weekend , so ProtagonistA was a bit nervous as the train pulled into the station . But ProtagonistA quickly made ProtagonistA's way through the crowds and found ProtagonistA's way to ProtagonistA's new dorm . It did n't take long for ProtagonistA to settle into ProtagonistA's new life . ProtagonistA loved the freedom of being on ProtagonistA's own and the excitement of the city . ProtagonistA quickly made friends and started exploring all that Boston had to offer . ProtagonistA's first year of college was a great success . ProtagonistA learned a lot , both inside and outside of the classroom . ProtagonistA also grew a lot as a person . ProtagonistA was more confident and independent than ever before . Looking back , ProtagonistA is glad that ProtagonistA took the leap and moved to Boston . It was definitely the right decision for ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was sixteen and in love . And ProtagonistA was going to have to kill someone . It was n't something ProtagonistA wanted to do , but ProtagonistA knew it had to be done . ProtagonistA's love was worth more than anything else in the world , and ProtagonistA was willing to do whatever it took to protect it . ProtagonistA had planned everything out perfectly . ProtagonistA would wait until ProtagonistA's victim was alone , and then ProtagonistA would strike . It would be quick and painless , and over before they knew what was happening . ProtagonistA was confident in ProtagonistA's ability to do this . The only thing left was to choose ProtagonistA's victim . ProtagonistA thought about it for a long time , and eventually settled on the person who ProtagonistA thought was the biggest threat to ProtagonistA's relationship . Once ProtagonistA had made ProtagonistA's decision , there was no turning back . The day of the murder arrived , and ProtagonistA's heart was pounding in ProtagonistA's chest . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to go through with it , but ProtagonistA was still scared . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and steadied ProtagonistA before making ProtagonistA's move . The victim was alone , just as ProtagonistA had planned . ProtagonistA snuck up behind them and struck quickly and efficiently . It was over before the victim even knew what was happening . ProtagonistA felt a wave of relief wash over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had done it . ProtagonistA had protected ProtagonistA's love , and now nothing could come between them . ProtagonistA was willing to do whatever it took to keep ProtagonistA's relationship safe , even if it meant taking a life . 
ProtagonistA was a good and kind woman , and as such ProtagonistA would not have anything to do with a sick man . ProtagonistA was content to live a life of solitude , only interacting with others when absolutely necessary . ProtagonistA's only companions were the books ProtagonistA read and the animals ProtagonistA cared for . One day , however , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA's door , begging for help . ProtagonistA hesitated , but ProtagonistA's kind heart won out and ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB in . ProtagonistA nursed ProtagonistB back to health , and in the process , fell in love with ProtagonistB . They were married a year later , and lived happily ever after . ProtagonistA learned that sometimes the best things in life come from those we least expect it . 
ProtagonistA had been sitting in the cart behind the house for hours , but ProtagonistA had kept ProtagonistA's eyes on the horses , which were galloping along at a good clip . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be coming home soon and ProtagonistA wanted to be ready to greet ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was getting a little bit tired , but ProtagonistA did n't want to miss ProtagonistA's chance to see ProtagonistB . Finally , ProtagonistA saw the horses coming around the bend in the road and ProtagonistA jumped up , waving ProtagonistA's arms . ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA and waved back , looking exhausted but happy . ProtagonistB brought the horses to a stop and jumped down , giving ProtagonistA a big hug .  ProtagonistB 'm so glad to see ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 've been thinking about ProtagonistA all day .  
ProtagonistA was never a fan of birds . ProtagonistA found them to be dirty and noisy creatures . But ProtagonistB loved them . So , when ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to take care of the three rooks while ProtagonistB was away , ProtagonistA reluctantly agreed . ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to take care of the birds , but ProtagonistA was never really comfortable around them . ProtagonistA would often find them staring at ProtagonistA with their beady eyes , as if they were judging ProtagonistA . One day , while ProtagonistA was cleaning the cages , one of the rooks escaped . ProtagonistA panicked and tried to catch the bird , but it was too fast . ProtagonistA watched as the bird flew away , wondering if ProtagonistA would ever see it again . ProtagonistB was not happy when ProtagonistA found out about the escaped bird . But ProtagonistB said ,  It is what it is . And it 's what ProtagonistA get for not taking care of them properly . ProtagonistA felt guilty and vowed to do better . ProtagonistA started paying more attention to the birds and soon developed a bond with them . ProtagonistA even started to enjoy their company . It was a strange turn of events , but in the end , ProtagonistA learned to love the birds as much as ProtagonistB did . 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA 'd killed ProtagonistB . It was an accident , of course . ProtagonistA did n't mean to do it . But now that ProtagonistB was gone , ProtagonistA realized how much ProtagonistA depended on ProtagonistB . Without ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was nothing . Just a girl with a few tricks up ProtagonistA's sleeve . ProtagonistA was nothing without ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA stood up from ProtagonistA's chair and leaned forward , ProtagonistA's head leaned forward and ProtagonistA's hands clasped across ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA was trying to make sense of what ProtagonistA had just seen . Was it really a rabbit ? And if so , why was it wearing a waistcoat ? ProtagonistA had never seen a rabbit like that before . Suddenly , the rabbit turned and saw ProtagonistA . It seemed just as surprised to see ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA was to see it . For a moment , they just stared at each other . Then , the rabbit spoke . I'm late , I 'm late , for a very important date !  it said . And with that , it turned and dashed away . ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA just stood there , staring after the rabbit . Then ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was late for ProtagonistA's own date . ProtagonistA quickly grabbed ProtagonistA's things and ran out the door . ProtagonistA never did find out what that rabbit was up to , but ProtagonistA always wondered if ProtagonistA would see it again . 
ProtagonistA was in the midst of the courtyard around ProtagonistA's apartment . ProtagonistA had just finished ProtagonistA's morning jog and was now stretching ProtagonistA's muscles . As ProtagonistA bent down to touch ProtagonistA's toes , ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA turned around to see a large , black rat scurry away . ProtagonistA shuddered and quickly finished ProtagonistA's stretches before going inside . 
ProtagonistA sighed as ProtagonistA looked around ProtagonistA's grey , smoggy neighbourhood . It was hard to believe that just a few months ago , the skies had been a bright , beautiful blue . Now , they were a dull , lifeless silver . The sun was still shining , but even its rays could n't penetrate the thick layer of smog that now blanketed the city . ProtagonistA missed the days when ProtagonistA could sit in ProtagonistA's front yard and admire the view . Now , all ProtagonistA could see was a sea of concrete and metal . The only green left was in ProtagonistA's little garden , and even that was struggling to survive . ProtagonistA stared into ProtagonistA's garden pond , imagining a world without smog . In ProtagonistA's mind , ProtagonistA could see the blue skies and the bright sun . ProtagonistA could feel the warmth of the sun on ProtagonistA's skin and the freshness of the air . It was a beautiful world , and ProtagonistA longed to be there . 
It was a great , wonderful day in the year 1780 , when ProtagonistA gave birth to ProtagonistA's second child . ProtagonistA was so happy and excited to have a new baby in the family . Everything went smoothly and the baby was healthy and perfect . 
The last night ProtagonistA had been on earth , ProtagonistA could n't believe it . ProtagonistA had a dream where ProtagonistA was just a girl and ProtagonistA was walking along in the garden , and suddenly a great wickedness smote ProtagonistA , and - now this is scary ! - and ProtagonistA was flying . In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA saw the most beautiful creatures ProtagonistA had ever seen , and they were flying too . They were flying towards a great light , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was flying towards the light too . Then ProtagonistA woke up . 
ProtagonistA was born to a wealthy family in the city of Paris on the morning of the 19th of February , 1612 . ProtagonistA was a beautiful baby girl with big blue eyes and a head of curly blond hair . ProtagonistA's parents named ProtagonistA's Alice after ProtagonistA's maternal grandmother . ProtagonistA was a happy and healthy child who loved to play and explore . ProtagonistA was always curious about the world around ProtagonistA and loved to ask questions . As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA continued to be a bright and inquisitive young lady . ProtagonistA was an excellent student and was always eager to learn new things . When ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB . They were very much in love and had a beautiful wedding . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB settled down in a lovely house in the countryside . They were very happy there and had two wonderful children together . ProtagonistA was a devoted wife and mother and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's family very much . Sadly , ProtagonistA's idyllic life was cut short when ProtagonistA contracted a deadly illness and passed away at the age of thirty - two . ProtagonistB and children were devastated by ProtagonistA's untimely death . ProtagonistA was a kind , caring , and loving person who was taken from this world far too soon . ProtagonistA will be forever missed by those who loved ProtagonistA . 
It was early morning on the fifth of July , and ProtagonistC was out walking along the banks of the Thames with several other people . They were in the vicinity of a house called the Mulhouse , which belonged to ProtagonistA . On ProtagonistA's deathbed , ProtagonistA had given permission for ProtagonistB to live in the room where ProtagonistB was born , and so that is where ProtagonistB was living now . As they walked , they talked and laughed together , enjoying the beautiful morning . The sun was just starting to peek over the horizon , and the birds were singing in the trees . It was a peaceful and happy time . Suddenly , they heard a loud noise coming from the Mulhouse . It sounded like someone was crying or screaming inside . They all stopped and looked at each other , wondering what to do . ProtagonistC decided to investigate . ProtagonistC walked up to the house and knocked on the door . When no one answered , ProtagonistC cautiously opened it and peeked inside . What ProtagonistC saw was ProtagonistB , lying on the floor in a pool of blood . It was clear that ProtagonistB had been brutally murdered . ProtagonistC immediately ran back to the others and told them what ProtagonistC had seen . They all agreed that they should go to the authorities and report what they had found . The police arrived soon after and began to investigate the scene . It was a tragic event , but thanks to the quick thinking of ProtagonistC , justice was eventually served . 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the bed , looking at ProtagonistA in the mirror . ProtagonistA was wearing a white dress and ProtagonistA's hair was in a perfect bun . ProtagonistA looked like a princess . ProtagonistA was so beautiful . But ProtagonistA did n't feel beautiful . ProtagonistA felt like a fraud . ProtagonistA was pretending to be something ProtagonistA was n't . ProtagonistA was pretending to be happy . But ProtagonistA was n't happy . ProtagonistA was miserable . ProtagonistA hated ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA hated who ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could just disappear . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could just disappear and never be seen again . 
ProtagonistA rode ProtagonistA's yellow horse through the desert , ProtagonistA's destiny unknown to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA came across an old city , its walls and towers still standing , but the air and roads were trembling . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA's destiny was waiting for ProtagonistA in this city . 
ProtagonistA had a really long way to go to reach the point when ProtagonistA could step into the kitchen without looking over ProtagonistA's shoulder . ProtagonistA had been living in fear for so long , always looking over ProtagonistA's shoulder , always wondering when the other shoe was going to drop . But finally , after years of therapy and hard work , ProtagonistA was starting to feel like maybe , just maybe , ProtagonistA could let ProtagonistA guard down a little bit . It was a slow process , but ProtagonistA was getting there , and that kitchen felt like a symbol of ProtagonistA's progress . 
ProtagonistA was getting ProtagonistB ready for college . It was a bittersweet moment for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was excited for ProtagonistB to start this new chapter in ProtagonistB's life , but ProtagonistA was also going to miss ProtagonistB terribly . They had been packing all day and were both exhausted . ProtagonistB's trunk was especially heavy . As ProtagonistA waded through the mud , ProtagonistA could n't help but think of all the memories they had made together . ProtagonistA was going to miss ProtagonistB's laughter , but ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was going to do great things . 
ProtagonistA had been dreaming for more than two years , and right now the thought that ProtagonistA would have to die thrilled ProtagonistA more than anything else . ProtagonistA was ready to die , to leave this world behind and enter the next . ProtagonistA had been dreaming of the moment ProtagonistA would die for so long , and now it was finally here . ProtagonistA was excited to see what would happen next , to see what the afterlife would be like . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let out a deep breath as ProtagonistA died . 
To Carol is very nearly a treasure , and though it is not proper to discuss the disposition of ProtagonistA before ProtagonistA has attained to a certain age , I shall say that the owner of the house opposite to which I am now sitting , and of a certain age there never was a person who , till ProtagonistA had reached ProtagonistA's twenty - first birthday , could not plainly distinguish ProtagonistA – those persons were all strangers to ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA is a bully , is n't ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistA 's always picking on other kids and making them feel bad about themselves . But what ProtagonistA's victims do n't realize is that ProtagonistA is actually just a big scaredy - cat . ProtagonistA 's scared of what other people think of ProtagonistA , so ProtagonistA tries to make them think ProtagonistA 's better than them . But deep down , ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA 's not really a bully . ProtagonistA 's just a scared little girl . 
It was a hot day , said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA sat down at the table in the dining - room , which was in the middle of the house . The sun was streaming in through the windows and the air was thick and heavy . ProtagonistA felt as though ProtagonistA could barely breathe . ProtagonistA fanning ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's hand , but it did little to alleviate the heat . Suddenly , the door to the dining - room opened and in walked ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was carrying a large tray of food , which ProtagonistB placed in the middle of the table . ProtagonistB then went over to the windows and began to open them , letting in a much - needed breeze . There , that 's better ,  ProtagonistB said .  It was getting a bit stuffy in here . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB then sat down and began to enjoy their meal . ProtagonistA was grateful for the relief from the heat and was soon able to forget about the oppressive heat outside . 
I am a man of thirty - nine years , and a thousand and one years ago at the beginning of the twelfth century ProtagonistA , appeared in the court of ProtagonistB , and ordered the execution of four hundred and fifty - two religious and political persons . ProtagonistA was a beautiful woman with long dark hair and piercing blue eyes . ProtagonistA's skin was pale and flawless . ProtagonistA wore a simple white dress that flowed down to ProtagonistA's feet . ProtagonistA was barefoot . ProtagonistA walked into the court and ProtagonistB immediately ordered ProtagonistB's guards to seize ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was brought before ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB demanded to know who ProtagonistA was and what ProtagonistA was doing there . ProtagonistA simply replied that ProtagonistA was a messenger from ProtagonistC and that ProtagonistA had come to deliver a message to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistC had seen the way ProtagonistB had been ruling the empire and that ProtagonistC was not pleased . ProtagonistA warned ProtagonistB that unless ProtagonistB changed ProtagonistB's ways , ProtagonistC would bring down ProtagonistC's wrath upon ProtagonistB and the empire . ProtagonistB was not a man who tolerated dissent or threats . ProtagonistB ordered ProtagonistA to be executed immediately . ProtagonistA was brought to the executioner 's block and ProtagonistA's head was severed from ProtagonistA's body . As ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistB and smiled . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's message would be delivered , even if it cost ProtagonistA ProtagonistA's life . 
ProtagonistA lay for some minutes on the river bank , babbling in the shallow water of the river while the great army of the Lō̏kampans swept towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a small child , and the Lōkampans were a fearsome people . They had come to conquer ProtagonistA's village , and ProtagonistA knew that they would kill ProtagonistA if they found ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was terrified , but ProtagonistA could not bring ProtagonistA to move . ProtagonistA lay there , trembling , as the Lōkampans approached . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name . It was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was running towards ProtagonistA , calling out to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB scooped ProtagonistA up in ProtagonistB's arms and ran back towards the village . The Lōkampans were close behind them , but they managed to make it to safety . ProtagonistA was safe , but ProtagonistA's village had been destroyed . ProtagonistA would never forget the terror ProtagonistA felt that day , as ProtagonistA lay on the river bank , waiting for the Lōkampans to find ProtagonistA . 
In those days there was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was a good , honest man , and a man of sense , and ProtagonistA knew what was good for ProtagonistA ; and ProtagonistA was called Adam , and ProtagonistA was wise . And ProtagonistA had two daughters , and the one was called Eve , and the other was called Lilith . And they were both good women , and they were both honest , and they were both wise . And they loved each other dearly . And they had ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB's name was Cain . And ProtagonistB was a good man , and ProtagonistB was honest , and ProtagonistB was wise . 
ProtagonistA was a weak old woman , but ProtagonistA had a good mind . ProtagonistA was always thinking about the world and how it worked . ProtagonistA was curious about everything and wanted to know more . One day , ProtagonistA decided to ask ProtagonistB about the world .  ProtagonistB , how does the world work ?  ProtagonistA asked .  Well , ProtagonistA , it 's a bit complicated ,  ProtagonistB replied .  But ProtagonistB 'll try to explain it to ProtagonistA .   The world is round , and it spins on its axis ,  ProtagonistB began .  The sun is what gives us day and night , and the moon is what causes the tides .   That 's amazing !  ProtagonistA exclaimed .  Yes , it is ,  ProtagonistB said .  But there 's still more to learn .  
ProtagonistB had always said that the best way to get information out of ProtagonistA in the future was not to kill ProtagonistA , but to expose ProtagonistA , to the light of ridicule . So , when the time came , ProtagonistB did just that . ProtagonistB called a press conference and announced that ProtagonistA , had been having an affair with one of ProtagonistA's students . The media had a field day with the story , and ProtagonistA was soon laughed out of ProtagonistA's job . ProtagonistA became a laughing - stock in ProtagonistA's community , and no one would talk to ProtagonistA . Eventually , ProtagonistA became so despondent that ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's own life . ProtagonistB felt that ProtagonistB had finally gotten the information ProtagonistB needed out of ProtagonistA . 
In the summer of that year , 1577 , ProtagonistA , wrote a letter to the Golden Bough , in the neighbourhood of Jermyn , in Yorkshire , where ProtagonistA then was living , in which ProtagonistA says:I have been thinking much about you of late , dear Bough , and wondering how you are getting on . ProtagonistA am sure you must be very lonely without ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA long to see you again . ProtagonistA am sure you will be glad to hear that ProtagonistA am coming home soon .

ProtagonistA am sure you will be as pleased as ProtagonistA was to hear that ProtagonistB has promised to help ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's work . ProtagonistA am sure you will be as pleased as ProtagonistA am to hear that ProtagonistA have been appointed as ProtagonistB's personal adviser , and that ProtagonistA am to be a member of ProtagonistB's Privy Council . ProtagonistA am sure you will be as proud of ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA am of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA hope that you will come and visit ProtagonistA soon , so that we can celebrate ProtagonistA's good fortune together . ProtagonistA 
Frank Wilson , an old friend and colleague of ProtagonistA's , once said ,  ProtagonistB am afraid , ProtagonistA , that when ProtagonistC is doing a little bit of necessary thing , you know all about it , and ProtagonistA 's got all sorts of things on ProtagonistA's conscience , but when ProtagonistA is doing all sorts of unnecessary thing , you never know what 's going on , you just know you 're used to it , and it 's when you 're doing a great deal of unnecessary thing that you really get into trouble . ProtagonistA was always a bit of a mystery to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was always doing things that did n't seem to make any sense , and yet , ProtagonistA always managed to come out on top . ProtagonistB could n't help but admire ProtagonistA for it , even if ProtagonistB did n't always understand ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA came to ProtagonistB with a problem .

ProtagonistC is in trouble and ProtagonistA do n't know how to help ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB thought for a moment and then said ,  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 're a smart woman . ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA 'll figure it out . And sure enough , ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA figured out a way to help ProtagonistC and everything worked out in the end . As always , ProtagonistA had come out on top .

ProtagonistB loved to watch ProtagonistA in action . ProtagonistA was always so graceful and elegant . One day , ProtagonistB decided to take a turn at hosting tea time . ProtagonistB sent for the servants and lay down on the front steps of the Black family house . ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB poured cup after cup of tea . ProtagonistB was determined to show ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB could be just as graceful and elegant as ProtagonistA was . After a few minutes , ProtagonistA started to clap . ProtagonistA was impressed with ProtagonistB's performance . ProtagonistB had successfully managed to host tea time just like ProtagonistA . From then on , tea time was always a special time for the two of them to share . 
One day , when ProtagonistB was 13 and ProtagonistA was only five , their mother took them to see the ancient statue of the Roman emperor Antonius . ProtagonistA was fascinated by the statue and asked ProtagonistA's mother a lot of questions about it . ProtagonistB , on the other hand , was not interested in the statue at all . ProtagonistB thought it was boring and wished they had gone to see something else . 
The last time I saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was a short , sallow - faced young man with hair like the top of ProtagonistA's head , and a goatee as big as ProtagonistA was broad . ProtagonistA was wearing a pair of overalls and a plaid shirt , and ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA was ready to work on a farm . I did n't recognize ProtagonistA at first , but then I remembered the time we spent together in high school . We were in the same grade , but we never really talked to each other . I always thought ProtagonistA was a bit weird , and I guess ProtagonistA thought the same about me . But then , one day , we were paired together in a project , and we started talking . And we just clicked . We were friends from then on . But then , ProtagonistA started to change . ProtagonistA stopped hanging out with ProtagonistA's other friends , and ProtagonistA started to dress differently . ProtagonistA started to wear dark clothes and ProtagonistA grew ProtagonistA's hair out . And then , one day , ProtagonistA showed up to school looking like a completely different person . I did n't know how to react , and I guess I just ignored ProtagonistA . I did n't see ProtagonistA again after that . until now . 
ProtagonistA has been going to the library since ProtagonistA was a little girl . ProtagonistA loves the smell of the books and the way the light shines in through the windows . When ProtagonistA gets the bright idea to go into the library by ProtagonistA , no one ever takes ProtagonistA up on it . ProtagonistA 's always been a bit of a loner , so it does n't bother ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA spends ProtagonistA's days exploring the stacks and reading whatever catches ProtagonistA's eye . ProtagonistA 's never had so much fun . 
ProtagonistA , took up residence in a large house in the center of Alexandria in 1659 . ProtagonistA was the daughter of a good family and had been raised to be a proper lady . However , ProtagonistA had a rebellious streak and ProtagonistA yearned for adventure . So , instead of staying home and getting married like ProtagonistA's parents wanted , ProtagonistA took up residence in the city . ProtagonistA quickly learned that living in the city was not as glamorous as ProtagonistA had thought . The streets were dirty and dangerous . ProtagonistA had to be careful not to go out alone at night . But ProtagonistA loved the freedom and the excitement of city life . One day , while ProtagonistA was out walking , ProtagonistA was accosted by a group of ruffians . They demanded ProtagonistA's money and ProtagonistA's jewels . ProtagonistA was terrified , but ProtagonistA refused to give them what they wanted . Suddenly , one of the men pulled out a knife and stabbed ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA collapsed to the ground , bleeding to death . As ProtagonistA lay there dying , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been foolish to think that the city was anything other than a dangerous place . ProtagonistA should have listened to ProtagonistA's parents and stayed home where it was safe . 
ProtagonistA's name was Chester , and ProtagonistA was thirty - four years old . ProtagonistA had been married for fifteen years , and ProtagonistA had two children . ProtagonistB was a stay - at - home dad , and ProtagonistA's children were both in school . ProtagonistA worked as a secretary for a small law firm . ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life , but ProtagonistA sometimes felt like ProtagonistA was missing something . One day , ProtagonistA came home from work and found ProtagonistB in the kitchen , cooking dinner . ProtagonistA was surprised , as ProtagonistB usually left that task to ProtagonistA . Mark , what are ProtagonistB doing ?  ProtagonistA asked . ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistB would make dinner for once ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB know ProtagonistA 're tired after work . ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistB's gesture , and they enjoyed a nice dinner together . Afterward , they went into the living room and sat down to watch TV . ProtagonistA was soon asleep , and ProtagonistB turned off the television and woke ProtagonistA up . ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB have something to tell ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said . What is it ?  ProtagonistA asked , sleepily . I'm leaving ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'm in love with someone else , and ProtagonistB 'm moving out . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA cried and begged ProtagonistB to stay , but ProtagonistB was adamant . ProtagonistB packed ProtagonistB's bags and left , and ProtagonistA was left alone with ProtagonistA's two children . ProtagonistA had to be strong for them , though ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was falling apart on the inside . ProtagonistA went to work and took care of ProtagonistA's children the best ProtagonistA could . It was hard , but ProtagonistA got through it . Eventually , ProtagonistA started dating again . ProtagonistA found someone who made ProtagonistA feel happy and whole again . ProtagonistA was finally able to move on from ProtagonistA's failed marriage and create a new life for ProtagonistA . 
The air grew still as ProtagonistA entered the main door of the old office , but ProtagonistA was ready . ProtagonistA had been preparing for this moment for weeks , and ProtagonistA was not going to let anything stop ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA walked confidently to ProtagonistB and asked for ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB hesitated for a moment before pointing ProtagonistA in the right direction . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and made ProtagonistA's way to the office . ProtagonistA could feel the eyes of the people around ProtagonistA on ProtagonistA's back , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA had a job to do . When ProtagonistA entered the office , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was sitting behind a large desk , and ProtagonistC did not look happy . ProtagonistA walked up to the desk and sat down in the chair opposite ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA looked ProtagonistC in the eye and said ,  ProtagonistA 'm here to talk to ProtagonistC about the job .  ProtagonistC leaned back in ProtagonistC's chair and looked at ProtagonistA for a long moment . Finally , ProtagonistC spoke .  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC 'm sorry , but we 've decided to go with someone else for the position .  ProtagonistA could feel the anger rising up inside of ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA forced ProtagonistA to stay calm .  May ProtagonistA ask why ?  ProtagonistA asked . ProtagonistC hesitated for a moment before answering .  It 's just not a good fit ,  ProtagonistC said .  ProtagonistC 'm sorry .  ProtagonistA stood up and walked out of the office . ProtagonistA was not going to give up that easily . ProtagonistA would find another way into that company , and ProtagonistA would get the job . 
ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's bony hands and feet enough to accommodate ProtagonistA to a load of cushions ; they made a little coffin for ProtagonistA , so heavy it contained four bales of straw . When they placed ProtagonistA inside , ProtagonistA could barely move an inch . The only thing ProtagonistA could do was to watch as the people around ProtagonistA wept and mourned ProtagonistA's death . 
ProtagonistA had been walking ProtagonistA's entire life . ProtagonistA was seventeen , ProtagonistA had a job , and ProtagonistA was going to go to Hogwarts . ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a wizard , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to get ProtagonistA's chance . ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA could barely contain ProtagonistA . The day finally arrived and ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way to the castle . ProtagonistA was met by the headmaster , who welcomed ProtagonistA warmly . ProtagonistA was shown to ProtagonistA's dormitory and given a wand . ProtagonistA was thrilled and could n't wait to start ProtagonistA's classes . Unfortunately , things did n't quite go as ProtagonistA 'd hoped . ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA was n't very good at magic . ProtagonistA struggled through ProtagonistA's classes , feeling like ProtagonistA was always behind . ProtagonistA's roommates were all much better than ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA did n't belong . ProtagonistA considered giving up and going home , but ProtagonistA did n't want to quit . ProtagonistA wanted to prove to ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could do it . So , ProtagonistA kept going and eventually started to improve . By the end of ProtagonistA's seventh year , ProtagonistA was one of the top students in ProtagonistA's class . ProtagonistA had made some great friends and was proud of what ProtagonistA had accomplished . 
ProtagonistA was a lanky seventeen - year - old when ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's village for the farm . ProtagonistA was n't used to the rough country life or the heat of the winter , but ProtagonistA was determined to be a farmer . ProtagonistA was very faithful to ProtagonistA's goal , even though it was difficult . ProtagonistA always had in mind that ProtagonistA ought to be a farmer , even though ProtagonistA might have to starve . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a troublemaker . On the very day the world was to begin to change , ProtagonistA did the most ridiculous thing that ever happened to ProtagonistA , and that is to have succeeded in changing the most important meeting of the village house into a hideous pantomime of torture , murder , and mayhem . The villagers were outraged , and ProtagonistA was arrested and thrown into jail . ProtagonistA spent the rest of ProtagonistA's days there , wondering what could have been if ProtagonistA had just behaved ProtagonistA . 
Not long ago ProtagonistA came at last to ProtagonistA's senses , and thought that ProtagonistA must be out of a job . ProtagonistA had been working at the same company for years , and had never once thought to question ProtagonistA's position . But now , after years of faithful service , ProtagonistA was finally starting to realize that ProtagonistA was being taken advantage of . ProtagonistA was paid very little , and was always given the most difficult and dangerous tasks to do . ProtagonistA was constantly being put in harm 's way , and ProtagonistA was tired of it . Finally , ProtagonistA decided to speak up for ProtagonistA and demand better treatment . ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB and told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was quitting . ProtagonistB was shocked , and tried to convince ProtagonistA to stay , but ProtagonistA was firm . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA deserved better , and ProtagonistA was going to find a job that would treat ProtagonistA right . 
There was once a man who was well known , and known very well , for the one thing ProtagonistA had in common with every other man in the world , though ProtagonistA did not know it at the time ProtagonistA was doing what every other man in the world did , ProtagonistA had in common with the man who was named Thomas , with the same qualifications , and quite at the same time , however , ProtagonistA possessed some things which no man in the world possessed : ProtagonistA had both the good and the bad of the human species ; and there is no one who finds more good in human nature than the man who has done no other good than what ProtagonistA had done on ProtagonistA's own account , but had done it all on the goodwill of ProtagonistA's country and ProtagonistA's countrymen . 
ProtagonistA was always a little too young to know what ProtagonistA really wanted , that was , except perhaps to know what ProtagonistA was really afraid of . ProtagonistA was afraid of the dark , of course , and of the monsters that might be lurking in it . But ProtagonistA was also afraid of the light , of the sun and the moon and the stars . They were so bright , so big , and they seemed to be watching ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was afraid of the sky , of the clouds , of the wind . ProtagonistA was afraid of the world , and of the people in it . ProtagonistA was afraid of ProtagonistA , and of the things ProtagonistA might do . 
If all ProtagonistA had ever wanted was a happy ending , ProtagonistA would have taken it . But ProtagonistA wanted more than that . ProtagonistA wanted an adventure . And so , ProtagonistA went off into the world , searching for new experiences . ProtagonistA met new people and saw new places . And , eventually , ProtagonistA found what ProtagonistA was looking for . ProtagonistA's happy ending . 
ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB . It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever seen ProtagonistB smile like that and ProtagonistA wondered what ProtagonistB had been up to . ProtagonistA was about to ask ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA's mother came into the room and asked what they were doing . ProtagonistB's smile faded and ProtagonistB said they were just talking . ProtagonistA's mother looked at ProtagonistA suspiciously and said ProtagonistA should go to ProtagonistA's room . ProtagonistA did n't want to go , but ProtagonistB said it was time for bed . ProtagonistA reluctantly went to ProtagonistA's room and lay down , but ProtagonistA could n't sleep . ProtagonistA kept thinking about ProtagonistB's smile and what it could mean . 
ProtagonistA was always a very curious child . When ProtagonistA was little , ProtagonistA was always asking questions and exploring ProtagonistA's surroundings . ProtagonistA had a great imagination and was always coming up with new ideas . ProtagonistA's curiosity was unquenchable , and ProtagonistA was always learning new things . ProtagonistA was a bright child who loved to learn . 
ProtagonistA , of course , corrects the usual scale , does not include the perils of infancy , such as the dread of drowning ; but there is no doubt that , all things considered , ProtagonistA is an individual of prodigious intelligence . ProtagonistA is , in fact , so intelligent that ProtagonistA is able to understand and solve problems that are far beyond the scope of most people . For example , ProtagonistA is able to solve complex mathematical problems in ProtagonistA's head , something that most people would need a calculator for . Additionally , ProtagonistA is an excellent strategist , able to see moves ahead in games like chess and go , and ProtagonistA is also a master of memory , able to remember vast amounts of information with ease . All of these abilities make ProtagonistA an extraordinary individual , and it is no wonder that ProtagonistA is considered one of the most intelligent people in the world . 
As the story of the life of ProtagonistA begins , we should recall that ProtagonistB , is dead . It is interesting to think about how different our lives would be if ProtagonistB had not written about ProtagonistA . Perhaps we would never have known ProtagonistA at all . Or , if we did , ProtagonistA would be a very different person . In any case , it is clear that ProtagonistB had a great influence on the life of ProtagonistA . 
I asked ProtagonistA for a free copy of the dictionary , and ProtagonistA gave me the manual . I was so excited to get my hands on a free copy of the dictionary that I did n't even mind that it was the manual . I thanked ProtagonistA profusely and went on my way . I spent the next few days pouring over the manual , and I was amazed at how much information was in there . I learned about the history of the dictionary , how it was compiled , and all sorts of interesting facts about words . I was particularly fascinated by the etymology of words , and I spent hours tracing the origins of my favorite words . Eventually , I had to return the manual to ProtagonistA , but I was grateful for the opportunity to have borrowed it . I now have a much greater appreciation for the dictionary , and I 'm even considering buying my own copy . 
There was ProtagonistA ; or ProtagonistA was both , or neither . It was hard to tell , with ProtagonistA's ever - changing form . One moment ProtagonistA would be a beautiful young woman , and the next ProtagonistA would be an old crone . ProtagonistA's eyes were always the same though , piercing and blue . They seemed to look right through you , as if ProtagonistA could see your very soul . ProtagonistA was a mystery , and that was part of ProtagonistA's appeal . People were drawn to ProtagonistA , even though they could n't quite understand ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always calm and collected , even in the midst of chaos . It was as if ProtagonistA knew something that the rest of us didn't . One day , ProtagonistA disappeared . ProtagonistA left no trace behind , except for those piercing blue eyes . They seemed to haunt those who knew ProtagonistA , as if they were asking a question that nobody could answer . What happened to ProtagonistA ? Was ProtagonistA a witch ? A goddess ? A demon ? Or was ProtagonistA something else entirely ? We may never know , but ProtagonistA will always be remembered . 
There is a place on a very small and very remote island in the Pacific where one can go into the deepest secrets of nature and find ProtagonistA .

If you are lucky enough to find ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA will share ProtagonistA's knowledge with you and help you to understand the mysteries of nature . 
ProtagonistA was a bad cook and a bad soldier , and ProtagonistA died of a broken heart .

ProtagonistA was constantly getting scolded by ProtagonistA's superior officers , and ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was never good enough . One day , ProtagonistA was assigned to cook for the entire battalion . ProtagonistA was so nervous that ProtagonistA burned the food . The other soldiers were so angry with ProtagonistA that they started throwing things at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was so humiliated that ProtagonistA ran away and enlisted in the army .

ProtagonistA picked it up and made a wish that ProtagonistA would get home safely . ProtagonistA continued walking and eventually made it home . ProtagonistA was tired and hungry , but ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA did n't have to spend any money on a lift home . 
ProtagonistA was always a bit of a liar . ProtagonistA would make up stories about ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA's family , ProtagonistA's friends . Sometimes ProtagonistA would even lie about things that had happened to ProtagonistA , making them sound more exciting or interesting than they really were . But there was one thing that ProtagonistA always told the truth about , and that was ProtagonistA's feelings . ProtagonistA would never sugarcoat how ProtagonistA felt about something , whether it was good or bad . And people always appreciated that about ProtagonistA , even if they did n't always believe everything ProtagonistA said . 
ProtagonistA had a very good eye , ProtagonistA's friend said , and looked after ProtagonistA's money .

A few days after ProtagonistA left , ProtagonistA received a call from ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was crying and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC was possessed by a demon . ProtagonistA did n't believe ProtagonistB at first , but ProtagonistA could hear the fear in ProtagonistB's voice . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to go back home and help ProtagonistC . When ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA could see the terror in ProtagonistC's eyes . The demon was torturing ProtagonistC and ProtagonistC was begging for mercy .

Some days ago I was sitting down at the kitchen table at Mary 's to finish a little bill for the woodworking shop , when I began to recall a good while back my father , who was a good - looking , well - to - do farmer who had in the last few years become a very wealthy man not only of ProtagonistA's own land but of ProtagonistA's own money , and who had been very careful , as a matter of course , to keep up with all the latest inventions and discoveries made in the field of agriculture , and who had , as a good - natured example , added to the wealth of ProtagonistA's country an immense amount , and whom I have never forgotten ProtagonistA's great credit to maintain because ProtagonistA had carried on the work of ProtagonistA's father at the same time of doing it , though not without much expense , and had yet enabled ProtagonistA to do much more than ProtagonistA had done before . 
ProtagonistA glared at ProtagonistB , vigorously stirring the bowl of frosting . ProtagonistA had the foul look of the psychotic . ProtagonistA was always so angry , always so ready to lash out .

ProtagonistA was back in the Kremlin , slinging hints at ProtagonistA's wife and son while ProtagonistA sat in ProtagonistA's comfortable chair . ProtagonistA was telling them about the time ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB and how ProtagonistB had charmed ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's wife and son were both skeptical , but ProtagonistA was adamant that ProtagonistB was a great guy . ProtagonistA told them about how ProtagonistB had given ProtagonistA a tour of the Kremlin and how ProtagonistB had showed ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's private collection of art . ProtagonistA even showed ProtagonistA's wife and son a picture of ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had taken while ProtagonistA was there . 
ProtagonistA had been working as a servant in the house for years . ProtagonistA was getting old and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's time was running out . ProtagonistA was content to live out ProtagonistA's days in the servants ' quarters , but ProtagonistA was always aware of the other servants ' gossip . One day , ProtagonistA overheard two of the younger servants talking about ProtagonistA . They were saying that ProtagonistA was crazy and that they were afraid to be around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was hurt by their words , but ProtagonistA knew that they were just gossiping . ProtagonistA decided to ignore them and went about ProtagonistA's business . 
ProtagonistA always hated ProtagonistA's name . It was so boring and unoriginal . ProtagonistA always wished ProtagonistA had a different , more interesting name . But ProtagonistA was stuck with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA always tried to make ProtagonistA's name more interesting by adding nicknames or middle names , but nothing ever stuck . ProtagonistA was always just Alice . And ProtagonistA hated it . 
ProtagonistA's name is Harry Potter , insisted ProtagonistA , shrugging ProtagonistA's shoulders and turning ProtagonistA's attention to the board in ProtagonistA's hands , busy thinking about what ProtagonistA was going to do with ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was always told ProtagonistA had potential , but ProtagonistA was never quite sure what that meant . All ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistA loved spending time with ProtagonistA's friends and family , and ProtagonistA loved learning new things . Maybe ProtagonistA could be a teacher , ProtagonistA thought , or a doctor . Or maybe ProtagonistA could be an astronaut . The possibilities were endless , and that was what ProtagonistA loved about ProtagonistA's life . 
ProtagonistA had been searching for ProtagonistA's mother 's house for fifteen minutes and was getting frustrated . ProtagonistA had been walking around the neighborhood for a while , but could n't seem to find the right house . Finally , ProtagonistA came to a door that looked familiar . ProtagonistA knocked on the door and ProtagonistA's mother answered . 
ProtagonistA was walking through a beautiful garden when ProtagonistA saw a door . ProtagonistA walked up to it and opened it . On the other side was a beautiful castle . ProtagonistA walked inside and saw a beautiful throne . ProtagonistA sat down in it and suddenly ProtagonistA was dreaming . In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA was a queen . ProtagonistA was wearing a beautiful dress and a crown . ProtagonistA was surrounded by ProtagonistA's subjects . They were all bowing to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was so happy . Then ProtagonistA woke up . 
It is to the great credit of ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA is now living . The only fault on which ProtagonistA is minded is that ProtagonistA has not yet regained the capacity of an adult man , but for whom , owing to the inherent value of youth and to ProtagonistA's own congenital beauty , the balance of society naturally imposed on ProtagonistA a certain age of vigor and of mature intellectual development . Nevertheless , it is to ProtagonistB's credit that ProtagonistA is living , and ProtagonistA is grateful to ProtagonistB for ProtagonistA's help in regaining some measure of mental and physical health . 
ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head dismissively as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB drift into the station carriages . ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB around before , always looking lost and alone . ProtagonistA wondered where ProtagonistB was going , and if anyone was waiting for ProtagonistB at the other end . ProtagonistB sat down in a carriage and stared out of the window , not moving as the train began to pull away from the platform . ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB until ProtagonistB was out of sight , wondering what ProtagonistB's story was . 
ProtagonistA was one of the most famous and respected minds of ProtagonistA's time . ProtagonistA was a woman of letters and a woman of ideas . But ProtagonistA was not a man . ProtagonistA was a woman . And ProtagonistA was respected for ProtagonistA's mind , not ProtagonistA's gender . 
ProtagonistA had bought a silvery , lustreless dress for £ 20 , which ProtagonistA had made ProtagonistA and which Carol had thrown away because ProtagonistA had no more money , gave ProtagonistA extreme suspicion of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did not like either of them . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB was following ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was right . ProtagonistB followed ProtagonistA into an alleyway and grabbed ProtagonistA from behind , gagging ProtagonistA with a dirty rag . ProtagonistB then proceeded to strip ProtagonistA of ProtagonistA's clothes , leaving ProtagonistA naked and vulnerable . ProtagonistB then took out a knife and began to stab ProtagonistA repeatedly . ProtagonistA struggled and fought , but ProtagonistA was no match for ProtagonistB's strength . ProtagonistA lay there , bleeding to death , as ProtagonistB laughed maniacally . 
There was once an old farmer in Oxfordshire , now dead and gone , who had lived long enough to see the day when playthings had their proper uses — when industry , rather than mere wit , was the proper measure of man 's worth ; when the frivolous avocations of childish boys , once well nigh spent , had in their turn given place to the occupations which distinguished the most respectable members of society ; when the good sense of the courts of law had been fairly given due regard , so that many of those cases in which society had once regarded as frivolous or trivial — and this was for the most part , indeed , the case , in which the good sense of the law had not in any way sufficed , but which were , or at any rate were , fairly decided by an inexperienced judge , who was , or rather was , permitted to decide them , according to the rules of the game — such were the days of ProtagonistA , when , as ProtagonistA was often apt to say ,   it was a game of chance , ye good folk   ( ProtagonistA was well aware that what ProtagonistA was about to say was absolutely true)—and it was a game of chance , as well as a game of chance ; for , when ProtagonistB is in possession of a fortune , it is very seldom that ProtagonistB finds ProtagonistB in possession of nothing but ProtagonistB's own mind and the power of ProtagonistB's imagination ; but as a matter of fact , it is most often the case that ProtagonistB finds ProtagonistB in possession of a fortune , not only owing to circumstances of fortune , but owing to the power of ProtagonistB's imagination . 
ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA does n't have time to explain . ProtagonistA 's been planning this for weeks and everything has to be perfect . ProtagonistA 's going to leave this town and never look back . ProtagonistA has a one way ticket to New York and ProtagonistA 's never been happier . ProtagonistA 's going to miss ProtagonistA's friends , but ProtagonistA knows they 'll understand . This is ProtagonistA's chance to start fresh and ProtagonistA 's not going to let anything stop ProtagonistA . 
Hush , ProtagonistB , said the gleam in ProtagonistA's eyes as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB run barefoot through the streets of London . It was ProtagonistB's first time in the city and ProtagonistB was determined to make the most of it . ProtagonistB had always been a free spirit , and this was ProtagonistB's chance to really let loose . ProtagonistA was happy to watch ProtagonistB enjoy ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that there was danger lurking in the shadows . ProtagonistA was right to be worried ; ProtagonistB did n't know the city like ProtagonistA did and ProtagonistB soon found ProtagonistB in a dark alleyway , alone and vulnerable . Thankfully , ProtagonistA was there to rescue ProtagonistB and they ran off into the night , laughing and carefree . 
I have stayed on at ProtagonistA's Hotel since the Titanic disappeared . At first , I was n't sure if I would be welcomed , as I was a gentleman and ProtagonistA was , well , a lady of the night . But ProtagonistA proved to be a perfect gentleman in every respect , and I have been happy here ever since . The hotel is a bit run down , but it has a certain charm and I feel safe here . ProtagonistA always has a kind word and a warm smile for me , and I know I can always count on ProtagonistA . 
The young men of the time of King Arthur stared at ProtagonistA , to see if ProtagonistA were really what they had supposed ProtagonistA to be . ProtagonistA was a strange creature , with ProtagonistA's big eyes and dark hair . ProtagonistA was wearing a dress that was much too big for ProtagonistA , and it made ProtagonistA look like a child . Are ProtagonistA really a witch ?  one of the men asked . Of course not ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm just a girl . But ProtagonistA have magic ,  another man said .  We saw ProtagonistA make the flowers grow . That 's not magic ,  ProtagonistA said .  That 's just a trick . Then show us another trick ,  the first man said . ProtagonistA thought for a moment . ProtagonistA had seen a lot of magic in ProtagonistA's life , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to do any of it ProtagonistA . Finally , ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA ca n't do any magic . ProtagonistA 'm just a girl . The men were disappointed , but they did n't want to believe that ProtagonistA was just a girl . They had seen too much evidence of ProtagonistA's magic . ProtagonistA 's a witch ,  one of them said .  We should burn ProtagonistA . The others agreed , and they started to make a fire . ProtagonistA was terrified , and ProtagonistA started to cry . Please do n't ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm not a witch . ProtagonistA 'm just a girl . But the men did n't listen , and they put ProtagonistA on the fire . ProtagonistA screamed as the flames engulfed ProtagonistA . And then ProtagonistA was gone . 
ProtagonistA had been the last of the contestants , but ProtagonistA 'd won . ProtagonistA 'd been so sure that ProtagonistA was going to lose that ProtagonistA 'd almost not even entered the contest . But ProtagonistA 'd decided to give it a shot , and ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had . ProtagonistA 'd won a trip to Hawaii , and ProtagonistA was going to enjoy every minute of it . ProtagonistA was going to spend ProtagonistA's days lounging on the beach , drinking cocktails , and getting a tan . ProtagonistA was going to have the time of ProtagonistA's life . 
ProtagonistA stared out the window , watching the raindrops race each other down the glass . ProtagonistA loved rainy days ; they always made ProtagonistA feel so cozy and safe inside . But today , for some reason , ProtagonistA felt a little bit restless . ProtagonistA paced around the living room for a while , then went to the kitchen to make some tea . As ProtagonistA waited for the kettle to boil , ProtagonistA's eyes fell on the old family photo album that was sitting on the counter . ProtagonistA had never really looked through it before , but for some reason , today felt like the perfect day to do so . ProtagonistA sat down at the kitchen table with the album and a cup of tea , and began flipping through the pages . There were pictures of ProtagonistA's parents when they were young , pictures of ProtagonistA as a baby , and even a few pictures of ProtagonistA's grandparents . ProtagonistA smiled as ProtagonistA looked at each one , but ProtagonistA could n't help feeling a little bit sad , too . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's family so much . ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't even hear the front door open . It was n't until ProtagonistA heard footsteps in the hallway that ProtagonistA realized someone was there . ProtagonistA got up quickly , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest , and went to see who it was . To ProtagonistA's relief , it was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief and invited ProtagonistB in . I'm so glad ProtagonistB 're here ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA was feeling a little bit lonely . ProtagonistB sat down at the table with ProtagonistA and they began to chat . It was nice to have someone to talk to . After a while , the rain outside began to let up and the sun started to peek out from behind the clouds . Do ProtagonistA want to go for a walk ?  ProtagonistB asked . ProtagonistA nodded , and they went outside . The fresh air felt good and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's spirits start to lift . Maybe today was n't going to be so bad after all . 
Unlike many high - class accountants in Paris , who ride in on a camel , or even a donkey , which is considerably larger , and which is slower than the standard coach , ProtagonistA rarely rode a mule , and ProtagonistA was very glad when ProtagonistA did ride a mule , because it enabled ProtagonistA to do all kinds of things within the limits of ProtagonistA's strength . For example , ProtagonistA was able to go to the market and buy fresh vegetables , which ProtagonistA then took home and cooked for ProtagonistA's family . ProtagonistA was also able to visit ProtagonistA's friends and relatives , and even go on short trips outside of the city . 
ProtagonistA had always been a big fan of Quidditch . ProtagonistA loved watching the games and dreamed of one day being a professional player . When ProtagonistA was twelve , ProtagonistA started to think about winning the Quidditch World Cup . ProtagonistA knew it would be a long shot , but ProtagonistA was determined to try . ProtagonistA started practicing every day , and ProtagonistA quickly became one of the best players in ProtagonistA's school . When ProtagonistA was sixteen , ProtagonistA was recruited to play for the national team . ProtagonistA worked hard and helped the team win the World Cup . It was a dream come true for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was proud to have achieved ProtagonistA's goal . 
There are many people who do not know it , but who know it very well , who say that men are born with Alice to . It is not easy to find out , but it is not difficult to find out either . All you have to do is look . And when you find it , you will know it . 
ProtagonistA had no name , and no business of ProtagonistA's own , but ProtagonistA had been told many a great lie , and none of them made a hair 's breadth more certain . ProtagonistA had been told that the world was round , and that it revolved around the sun . ProtagonistA had been told that there were other worlds out there , and that ProtagonistA was just a speck of dust in the grand scheme of things . But ProtagonistA did n't believe any of it . It was all just too incredible . So ProtagonistA went on living ProtagonistA's life , day by day , not really caring about anything beyond ProtagonistA's small world . 
ProtagonistA had thought ProtagonistA dead more times than ProtagonistA cared to remember . It was always a shock when ProtagonistA woke up , disoriented and confused . ProtagonistA would try to sit up , only to find ProtagonistA pinned down by some invisible force . ProtagonistA would try to cry out , but no sound would come out . ProtagonistA would struggle and fight , but it was always futile . ProtagonistA would eventually give up , resigning ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's fate . But then , one day , ProtagonistA woke up and ProtagonistA was free . ProtagonistA could move and ProtagonistA could speak . ProtagonistA did n't know what had happened , but ProtagonistA was grateful for it . ProtagonistA got up and looked around , only to find ProtagonistA in a strange place . ProtagonistA did n't recognize anything , but ProtagonistA could hear voices . ProtagonistA followed the voices , only to find ProtagonistA in front of a large door . ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , before finally opening the door . ProtagonistA gasped as ProtagonistA saw the sight before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was in a vast hall , with a long table in the middle . Sitting around the table were all sorts of creatures , some ProtagonistA recognized and some ProtagonistA didn't . And at the head of the table was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistB's voice soft and gentle .  Welcome back .  
The idea had never entered ProtagonistA's mind that ProtagonistA might one day one day , one day , make it to the top of Death . ProtagonistA had always been content to live in ProtagonistA's small village , surrounded by ProtagonistA's family and friends . But one day , everything changed . A group of adventurers came to ProtagonistA's village , seeking someone to join their quest to climb to the top of Death . And to ProtagonistA's surprise , ProtagonistA was chosen . ProtagonistA had always been a brave girl , so ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to join the group . And so the journey began . It was a long and difficult one , but ProtagonistA persevered . Finally , after months of climbing , they reached the top . And there , at the top of Death , ProtagonistA found what ProtagonistA had been searching for all along : ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was driving up the hill when ProtagonistA drove ProtagonistA's horse into a deep ravine . The horse was stuck and could n't get out . ProtagonistA tried to help the horse , but it was too heavy . ProtagonistA had to go for help . 
It is the duty of ProtagonistA to help ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA has been helping ProtagonistB since ProtagonistB was a little girl and ProtagonistA will continue to help ProtagonistB as long as ProtagonistA can . ProtagonistB is always grateful for ProtagonistA's help , and ProtagonistB knows that ProtagonistB would not be able to survive without ProtagonistA . 
When I was a boy , ProtagonistA always had a large library in which ProtagonistA kept all that ProtagonistA had learned in ProtagonistA's medical profession , in addition to all the books which ProtagonistA had in ProtagonistA's room . ProtagonistA was always very kind to me , and would often let me borrow books from ProtagonistA's library . I remember one time , I borrowed a book on anatomy from ProtagonistA , and I was really fascinated by it . I would often go to ProtagonistA's house just to read ProtagonistA's books . 
ProtagonistA had been fighting the Black Council for years . They were a powerful group of witches who terrorized the kingdom . ProtagonistA had finally had enough . ProtagonistA gathered ProtagonistA's army and marched on the Black Council 's castle . ProtagonistA fought ProtagonistA's way through the guards and took the castle by storm . The Black Council was defeated and the kingdom was saved . 
ProtagonistA had been very quiet all morning , but when ProtagonistA woke up it was to breathe the first sound of life . ProtagonistA had been in a coma for weeks , and the doctors had told ProtagonistA's family that ProtagonistA was n't going to make it . But here ProtagonistA was , alive and well . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA had survived , but ProtagonistA was grateful for the second chance . 
ProtagonistA was honoured to be asked by the guest to write a letter to the lady in the village of Cappella . ProtagonistA gladly agreed and set to work writing a beautiful letter full of compliments and well - wishes . ProtagonistA was sure the lady would be thrilled to receive such a kind letter from a stranger . 
ProtagonistA came to a house on a river that was looming ominously before ProtagonistA . The river was dark and foreboding , and the house seemed to be abandoned . ProtagonistA had a feeling that something was watching ProtagonistA from the shadows , but ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling . ProtagonistA approached the house cautiously , but the door was unlocked . ProtagonistA stepped inside and was immediately hit with a wave of cold air . The house was dark and musty , and it seemed to be empty . ProtagonistA began to feel uneasy , and ProtagonistA was about to leave when ProtagonistA heard a noise from upstairs . It sounded like someone was crying . ProtagonistA slowly made ProtagonistA's way up the stairs , and ProtagonistA found a door that was slightly ajar . ProtagonistA pushed it open and saw ProtagonistB sitting on the floor , crying . ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with terror in ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistB was obviously terrified , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA slowly backed out of the room and ran out of the house . ProtagonistA did n't know what was going on , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA did n't want to be there . 
ProtagonistA had brought home three sets of glasses and a large enough bag to keep them all , an obvious precaution since there was no way of knowing what ProtagonistA 'd be up against , especially when ProtagonistA was n't simply playing chess or poker or bowling . ProtagonistA was going to have to be prepared for anything , and that meant being able to see . The first set of glasses were for general use , the second were for reading , and the third ... Well , the third were for when ProtagonistA absolutely had to see . ProtagonistA was n't sure when ProtagonistA might need them , but ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would . After all , ProtagonistA had been prepared for everything else so far . 
As ProtagonistA thought , ProtagonistA lifted ProtagonistA's head up to look around ProtagonistA's bright blue house . And for a moment , ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA saw a long , dark , empty room , with little else than a door and a rickety stove . But then ProtagonistA blinked , and the room was gone , replaced by ProtagonistA's cozy living room with its comfortable furniture and bright fire in the fireplace . ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and went back to ProtagonistA's book . 
ProtagonistA left the room ; an amount of time must have elapsed since ProtagonistA had entered the room , since ProtagonistA had dismissed the servants , and had placed ProtagonistA's hand upon the double door , and had raised it slightly , so as to let the light of the morning through . ProtagonistA looked back upon the now familiar scene of ProtagonistA's morning toilette with a sense of satisfaction ; all ProtagonistA's preparations had been made with care , and not a detail was out of place . The result was a perfect picture of elegance and good taste . ProtagonistA smiled as ProtagonistA thought of the impression ProtagonistA was about to make upon the company at the breakfast - table . But as ProtagonistA turned to leave the room , ProtagonistA was suddenly aware of a presence behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA turned back , and saw , to ProtagonistA's horror , a figure dressed in black , with a hood pulled low over its face . It was motionless , but its very stillness was menacing . ProtagonistA's first impulse was to scream , but ProtagonistA managed to control ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was paralyzed with fear , and could only stand and stare at the apparition . It seemed to be waiting for ProtagonistA to make the first move . Finally , ProtagonistA gathered ProtagonistA's courage and spoke .  Who are you ?  ProtagonistA asked in a trembling voice .  What do you want?The figure made no reply , but continued to stare at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's fear turned to anger , and ProtagonistA stamped ProtagonistA's foot impatiently .  ProtagonistA demand to know who you are !  ProtagonistA cried .  You have no business here ! Leave at once , or ProtagonistA shall call the servants!Still the figure made no move , and ProtagonistA's anger turned to terror as ProtagonistA realized that it was not going to obey ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA turned and fled from the room , and did not stop until ProtagonistA had reached the safety of ProtagonistA's own bedroom . There , ProtagonistA sank down onto the bed , trembling and breathless . What had ProtagonistA seen ? Was it a ghost ? A burglar ? Or something even worse ? ProtagonistA had no idea , but ProtagonistA knew one thing for sure : ProtagonistA would never forget the terror of that moment as long as ProtagonistA lived . 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the barn , looking out over the field where ProtagonistA's father had once settled cattle . ProtagonistA was thinking about how ProtagonistA's life had changed so much in the last few years . ProtagonistA had gone from being a ranch hand to being the owner of the ranch . It was a lot of responsibility , but ProtagonistA loved it . ProtagonistA loved the land and the animals . ProtagonistA even loved the hard work . It was all worth it when ProtagonistA saw the look of pride in ProtagonistA's father 's eyes . 
ProtagonistA lay down on the bed , fingers crossed in ProtagonistA's hands , and thought about the day ProtagonistA would die . ProtagonistA had always been a morbid person , always thinking about death and what came after . ProtagonistA was n't scared of death , but ProtagonistA was curious . ProtagonistA wondered what it would be like to die . Would ProtagonistA see a white light ? Would ProtagonistA feel pain ? Or would it just be a peaceful sleep ? ProtagonistA hoped it would be the latter . ProtagonistA did n't want to die in pain , ProtagonistA wanted to die peacefully in ProtagonistA's sleep . ProtagonistA crossed her fingers tighter and closed ProtagonistA's eyes , imagining what it would be like to die . 
Not long after ProtagonistA had finished ProtagonistA's story ProtagonistA heard a voice speak from the woods .  That was a very good story ,  the voice said .  But I have a better one to tell . ProtagonistA was curious , so ProtagonistA followed the voice into the woods . The voice belonged to a beautiful woman who began to tell ProtagonistA a story about a kingdom that was in danger . The kingdom was being threatened by a dragon , and the only way to save it was for ProtagonistB to slay the dragon . But ProtagonistB was not brave at all , and ProtagonistB was sure ProtagonistB would die . The night before the battle , ProtagonistB prayed to ProtagonistC for help . ProtagonistB promised that if ProtagonistB survived , ProtagonistB would give ProtagonistB's life to ProtagonistC . The next day , ProtagonistB went into battle and surprisingly , ProtagonistB won . ProtagonistB kept ProtagonistB's promise and became a monk . ProtagonistA was amazed by the story and thanked the woman for telling it to ProtagonistA . 
As ProtagonistA sat in ProtagonistA's study at Hogwarts , thinking , ProtagonistB was staring at ProtagonistA with a look of wonder and admiration that rivaled any other eye in the world . ProtagonistA had seen that look before , but never directed at ProtagonistA . It was always reserved for someone else . ProtagonistA did n't know why , but ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA blushing under ProtagonistB's gaze . ProtagonistB finally broke the silence by asking ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as Frank . They began to talk and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA opening up to ProtagonistB in a way ProtagonistA never had with anyone before . ProtagonistB was easy to talk to and seemed to understand ProtagonistA in a way no one else ever had . As the conversation flowed , ProtagonistA began to feel something ProtagonistA had never felt before . ProtagonistA could n't put a name to it , but ProtagonistA knew it was something special . ProtagonistB felt it too and before long , they were sharing their first kiss . ProtagonistA knew that this was something ProtagonistA would never forget . 
ProtagonistA was born on a dark and stormy night . ProtagonistA's mother died in a car crash when ProtagonistA was just a few hours old . ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB did n't believe in magic or anything that could n't be explained by science . So , when ProtagonistA started to show signs of magical ability , ProtagonistB was very skeptical . ProtagonistB tried to ignore it and hope it would go away , but it only got stronger . Eventually , ProtagonistB had to face the fact that ProtagonistA was a witch . ProtagonistB was scared at first , but ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA and wanted to protect ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB did some research and found a group of witches who could help teach ProtagonistA how to control ProtagonistA's powers . They became like a second family to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA learned so much from them . ProtagonistA is now a powerful witch ProtagonistA and uses ProtagonistA's magic to help others . 
ProtagonistA was reading a book to ProtagonistA's son when ProtagonistA noticed that no one else in the room seemed to be reading . ProtagonistA walked over to the bookshelf and saw that there were no other books out .  ProtagonistA do n't think anyone else here has the same idea ,  ProtagonistA said as ProtagonistA stood up and walked back to ProtagonistA's son . 
When ProtagonistA was brought up , ProtagonistA was raised in a house of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was an angel who came down from heaven to plead with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA prevailed by ProtagonistA's grace and power upon the truth of ProtagonistB's pleadings . For of all the saints of the Gentiles , the most holy , and the most blessed , the greatest was ProtagonistA . And yet , though raised unto heaven and set up as a star of justice , yet ProtagonistA was esteemed in the sight of ProtagonistB , not by ProtagonistA's own merit , but for the work that ProtagonistA had done . Neither was ProtagonistA despised in the sight of ProtagonistB : but ProtagonistA was exalted above all things , and was received with the most great privileges , even of ProtagonistB . And it came to pass , that ProtagonistA was esteemed a star , by one of the angels of ProtagonistB ; but before ProtagonistA was even named , ProtagonistA was already a star , and could alone be distinguished from all others . 
ProtagonistA was a black - haired , skinny thirteen - year - old boy , who , like so many other young people in the late nineteenth century , was surprised to find out that ProtagonistA was going to be a man , and to live a long , long life . ProtagonistA had always thought that ProtagonistA would be a woman , and have a short life , like ProtagonistA's mother . But when ProtagonistA was told that ProtagonistA was going to be a man , ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA did n't know how to react , or what to do . But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to accept it , and make the best of it . ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA was also excited . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had a lot to learn , and that ProtagonistA would have to make some tough choices . But ProtagonistA was ready for the challenge , and ProtagonistA was determined to make the most of ProtagonistA's new life . 
ProtagonistA was warm , the yellow sunflower in ProtagonistA's hair , and ProtagonistA was silent all the while . ProtagonistA looked down at the daisy in ProtagonistA's hand and then back up at the sky . It was a beautiful day . The sun was shining and the birds were singing . ProtagonistA felt at peace . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and took a deep breath . 
In the year 1667 , ProtagonistA was accused of committing a most capital offense . With the assistance of a certain lady , whom ProtagonistA had known before , ProtagonistA was sentenced to be hanged . The lady helped ProtagonistA to escape and they fled to the colonies . There , they started a new life and ProtagonistA became a successful businesswoman . 
ProtagonistA was out for a walk on a beautiful summer day . The sky was a deep blue , and the mountains in the distance were a white . ProtagonistA was enjoying the scenery when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB waiting for ProtagonistA in ProtagonistB's car . ProtagonistB was going to drive ProtagonistA's home . 
ProtagonistA laid down in the bed and sank down to the level of ProtagonistA's knees . ProtagonistA felt the familiar warmth of the bedspread on ProtagonistA's skin and the mattress molding around ProtagonistA's body . ProtagonistA let out a deep breath and closed ProtagonistA's eyes , feeling the tension of the day melting away . ProtagonistA was just about to drift off to sleep when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the other side of the room . ProtagonistA slowly opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw ProtagonistB standing in the corner , watching ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA froze , not knowing what to do . ProtagonistB took a step forward and ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was a man . ProtagonistB was wearing a black hoodie and ProtagonistA could n't see ProtagonistB's face . ProtagonistB took another step towards ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA scrambled out of the bed , running towards the door . ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB running after ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was n't going to make it . ProtagonistA turned around and faced ProtagonistB , prepared for the worst . But instead of attacking ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB simply walked past ProtagonistA and out the door . ProtagonistA stood there for a moment , trying to process what had just happened . Then ProtagonistA ran to the door and locked it , making sure ProtagonistB was really gone . ProtagonistA leaned against the door , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest . What had just happened ? 
ProtagonistA had known nothing but blows from the very beginning , even before ProtagonistA became a hydra . As a child , ProtagonistA was constantly beaten by ProtagonistA's parents . They would hit ProtagonistA for any reason , even if ProtagonistA had n't done anything wrong . ProtagonistA was always afraid , always on edge . When ProtagonistA became a hydra , ProtagonistA thought things would be different . ProtagonistA would be able to defend ProtagonistA , to fight back . But even as a hydra , ProtagonistA was constantly under attack . ProtagonistA's parents would hit ProtagonistA with sticks , stones , anything they could find . They would hit ProtagonistA until ProtagonistA was bleeding , until ProtagonistA was unconscious . And then they would start all over again . ProtagonistA had had enough . ProtagonistA was done being a victim . ProtagonistA was done being beaten . ProtagonistA was done being a hydra . 
ProtagonistA had been working as a maid for ProtagonistB for years , and ProtagonistA knew all of ProtagonistB's secrets . ProtagonistA knew how to get ProtagonistB pregnant ; but ProtagonistB was n't exactly what ProtagonistA had in mind . ProtagonistA had always wanted a family of ProtagonistA's own , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's opportunity when ProtagonistB became pregnant . ProtagonistA convinced ProtagonistB to let ProtagonistA raise the child as ProtagonistA's own , and ProtagonistA promised to take care of ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's child . ProtagonistB agreed , and ProtagonistA became the mother ProtagonistA always wanted to be . 
ProtagonistA was a man of fifty - one years of age , but more than half a century dead , and turning over in ProtagonistA's grave , ProtagonistA was beginning to remember ProtagonistA's youth as though it had happened yesterday . ProtagonistA remembered the day ProtagonistA had first met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been out walking in the park with ProtagonistA's friends when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a tall , handsome man , and ProtagonistA could n't take ProtagonistA's eyes off ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA walked over to ProtagonistB and they began talking . It was love at first sight . They were married a year later and were happy together until the day ProtagonistB died . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB terribly , but ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA could remember ProtagonistB so vividly . 
ProtagonistA was an old man when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's late seventies , and ProtagonistB was in ProtagonistB's early twenties . ProtagonistA had been a patient of ProtagonistB for years , ever since ProtagonistB had started ProtagonistB's practice . ProtagonistA had always been a kind and gentle woman , and ProtagonistB had always been a respectful and caring doctor . One day , after ProtagonistA's usual check - up , ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB to sit down with ProtagonistA for a cup of tea . ProtagonistA had something ProtagonistA wanted to tell ProtagonistB . Dr . Watson ,  ProtagonistA began ,  ProtagonistA have something to confess . ProtagonistA 'm not really who ProtagonistB think ProtagonistA am . ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA , confused . ProtagonistA name is not Alice . It 's actually Alistair . ProtagonistA am a man . He was shocked . ProtagonistB had never suspected such a thing . But why did ProtagonistA pretend to be a woman ?  ProtagonistB asked . It 's a long story ,  ProtagonistA said .  But the short version is that ProtagonistA did it to protect ProtagonistA's family . We are of royal blood , and if the wrong people had found out , they would have been in danger . So ProtagonistA changed ProtagonistA's name and ProtagonistA's appearance and started living as a woman . It was the only way to keep them safe . He was amazed by ProtagonistA's story . ProtagonistB had never met anyone like ProtagonistA before . Thank ProtagonistA for telling ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB wo n't tell anyone . ProtagonistA's secret is safe with ProtagonistB .  
When ProtagonistC fell seriously ill , ProtagonistA , in the first months of the nineteenth century , had it in ProtagonistA to believe that ProtagonistA owed ProtagonistA's life to the kindness of ProtagonistB . The teacher , a woman in ProtagonistB's seventies , had been retired for years , but ProtagonistB still took an interest in ProtagonistB's former students . When ProtagonistB heard that ProtagonistC was ill , ProtagonistB went to visit ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB sat with ProtagonistC for hours , talking and laughing . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistC stories of ProtagonistB's own life and shared ProtagonistB's wisdom with ProtagonistC . When ProtagonistC was finally well enough to leave the hospital , ProtagonistB came to visit ProtagonistC again . ProtagonistB brought with ProtagonistB a book for ProtagonistA , a gift to help ProtagonistA through ProtagonistA's difficult times . 
ProtagonistA looked across the lake from the ship at the end of the wooden deck , which allowed ProtagonistA to see the grass and all the trees . ProtagonistA was on a cruise with ProtagonistA's family , and they were about to dock in the port . ProtagonistA could see the other ships in the harbor , and the people on the shore . ProtagonistA was excited to get off the ship and explore the town . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bright girl . ProtagonistA excelled in ProtagonistA's studies , and was top of ProtagonistA's class in mathematics . When ProtagonistA was younger , ProtagonistA had dreamed of becoming a doctor , but as ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA realized that it was n't the career for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't want to deal with sick people and their problems ; ProtagonistA wanted to help people prevent illnesses . And so , ProtagonistA decided to become a medical essayist . ProtagonistA was very successful in ProtagonistA's new career . ProtagonistA wrote many articles on various medical topics , and ProtagonistA's work was widely read . ProtagonistA was also very popular among ProtagonistA's colleagues . However , after a few years , ProtagonistA began to feel restless . ProtagonistA missed the excitement of ProtagonistA's old profession , and ProtagonistA longed to help people in a more direct way . And so , ProtagonistA made the decision to go back to medicine . ProtagonistA applied for a doctorate , and soon ProtagonistA was carrying on ProtagonistA's old profession once again . ProtagonistA was happy to be back in the field of medicine , and ProtagonistA quickly made a name for ProtagonistA as one of the most talented doctors in the country . 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who had been diagnosed with a terminal illness . ProtagonistA was given a year to live , and ProtagonistA made the most of it . ProtagonistA traveled , ProtagonistA laughed , ProtagonistA loved . And when ProtagonistA's time came , ProtagonistA died peacefully in ProtagonistA's sleep . But ProtagonistA's story did n't end there . ProtagonistA's soul left ProtagonistA's body and entered the afterlife . ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden , surrounded by loved ones who had died before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt at peace and finally at home . But ProtagonistA's journey was not over yet . ProtagonistA had to face ProtagonistA's greatest fear : judgement . ProtagonistA stood before a large door , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's life would be judged . But ProtagonistA was not afraid . ProtagonistA had lived a good life , and ProtagonistA was ready to face whatever came next . 
ProtagonistA was dead , but ProtagonistA was gone : how could ProtagonistA have known that ProtagonistA was dead ? ProtagonistA had died in ProtagonistA's sleep , peacefully and without pain . But when ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a dark place . ProtagonistA could n't see anything , and ProtagonistA could n't move . ProtagonistA did n't know how long ProtagonistA had been there , but it felt like forever . ProtagonistA was scared and alone , and ProtagonistA wanted to go home . But ProtagonistA could n't go home , because ProtagonistA was dead . 
ProtagonistA was not an expert in the art of voyaging , or even in navigation , but ProtagonistA was , however , an expert in sea - craft ; and Carol , was the same man who had made the first voyage , and had already brought with ProtagonistA , in consequence of curiosity and for infinite profit , a great quantity of useful knowledge and valuable experience , among which ProtagonistA had acquired , in a short time , because ProtagonistA had been accustomed to keep the knowledge of distant places in ProtagonistA's head , and had believed that ProtagonistA was always to find some necessary article for ProtagonistA's use in some remote corner of the earth , which ProtagonistA had come upon without any knowledge whatever of the locality . 
Just before ProtagonistA was to die , ProtagonistA was surprised to find ProtagonistA at a loss for words . ProtagonistA had always been a chatty person , always ready with a quip or a story , but in ProtagonistA's final moments , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA tongue - tied . ProtagonistA could hear the machines beeping around ProtagonistA , the sound of ProtagonistA's own labored breathing , but ProtagonistA could n't think of anything to say . ProtagonistA wanted to tell ProtagonistA's loved ones how much ProtagonistA loved them , to say goodbye , but the words would n't come . As the darkness began to close in around ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA could only hope that they would understand . 
ProtagonistA spent ProtagonistA's time reading , writing , dancing , or doing other things that were more likely to bring ProtagonistA into the world and bring ProtagonistA's pleasure . ProtagonistA was always drawn to the world of stories , and ProtagonistA loved to write ProtagonistA's own . ProtagonistA also loved to dance , and ProtagonistA often did so in ProtagonistA's room when no one was around . It made ProtagonistA feel alive and free . These were the things that brought ProtagonistA the most joy , and ProtagonistA often forgot about the outside world when ProtagonistA was lost in them . 
ProtagonistA was watching ProtagonistA's sister 's boy , said ProtagonistA , when , but for the unavoidable circumstance of striking ProtagonistA's beloved infant with ProtagonistA's hammer , ProtagonistA should have had the satisfaction of buying it at a reduced price . The baby was crying and ProtagonistA felt terrible , but ProtagonistA's sister just laughed and said that it was only a flesh wound . 
ProtagonistB never taught ProtagonistA to be a real man . ProtagonistB always told ProtagonistA that being a woman was enough and that ProtagonistA did n't need to be anything else . But as ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA wanted more out of life than just being a woman . ProtagonistA wanted to be a man , in the proper sense of the word , with a true mind and a real purpose . ProtagonistA wanted to be someone who was not only ProtagonistB's son , but had the advantage of ProtagonistA's family , both ancestors and friends , and an equal share of the luck and fortune which they enjoyed . And so ProtagonistA set out to learn what it truly meant to be a man . ProtagonistA studied hard and learned everything ProtagonistA could . And eventually , ProtagonistA became the man ProtagonistA always wanted to be . 
ProtagonistA did not like the way ProtagonistA looked . ProtagonistA was too short , too round , and ProtagonistA's hair was always a mess . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could be more like ProtagonistA's friends , who were all tall and thin with perfect hair . One day , ProtagonistA decided to make a change . ProtagonistA started eating less and working out more , and soon ProtagonistA was the one with the perfect body . But even though ProtagonistA looked good on the outside , ProtagonistA still did n't feel happy . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was never going to be satisfied with the way ProtagonistA looked , and that was okay . 
There was ProtagonistA there , but I do n't know if I liked ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA did n't care whether I did or did n't like ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was just there , in the moment , living ProtagonistA's life . I admired that about ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't care what other people thought of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA just did ProtagonistA's own thing . I wished I could be more like that . 
ProtagonistA had always been a devout Christian , but when ProtagonistA's husband died , ProtagonistA began to doubt ProtagonistA's faith . ProtagonistA started to believe that maybe there were other forces at work in the world , forces that ProtagonistA could n't see or understand . So , when ProtagonistA sat down to read from the Book of the Law , ProtagonistA had only one intention and that was to banish ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had read about ProtagonistB in the book and knew that ProtagonistB was responsible for ProtagonistA's husband 's death . ProtagonistA was determined to get rid of ProtagonistB and make sure that ProtagonistB never hurt anyone again . ProtagonistA read the words of the banishment spell aloud and then felt a presence leave ProtagonistA's body . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was gone and ProtagonistA felt relief wash over ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had saved ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never doubt ProtagonistA's faith again . 
ProtagonistA wish it was a story , said ProtagonistA , holding out ProtagonistA's pinky index finger , which ProtagonistA dubbed super - power , to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB , giggled and put out ProtagonistB's own index finger to touch ProtagonistA . As their fingers touched , ProtagonistA felt a sudden jolt of power and ProtagonistB was pulled into ProtagonistA's story . Welcome to ProtagonistA's story ,  said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB around ProtagonistA's world .  Everything in here is make - believe , but that does n't make it any less real . The boy looked around wide - eyed as ProtagonistA introduced ProtagonistB to all the characters in ProtagonistA's story . There was the Cheshire Cat , the Mad Hatter , the White Rabbit , and many more . ProtagonistB laughed and played with them all , having the time of ProtagonistB's life . Eventually , ProtagonistA had to bring ProtagonistB back to reality .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , but ProtagonistB ca n't stay here forever ,  ProtagonistA said .  But ProtagonistA 'm sure ProtagonistB 'll always remember this place . The boy nodded and gave ProtagonistA a big hug before ProtagonistB left . ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB go , feeling happy that ProtagonistA was able to share ProtagonistA's story with someone . 
In the year of our Lord 1184 , ProtagonistA received a letter written by ProtagonistA's friends , in which they congratulated ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's success in a certain career in which ProtagonistA had been offered a fortune . ProtagonistA was overjoyed to receive the letter , and immediately set about writing a reply to ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA thanked them for their kind words , and told them that ProtagonistA was looking forward to starting ProtagonistA's new career . ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer , and ProtagonistA had always wanted to make a difference in the world . ProtagonistA was grateful to ProtagonistA's friends for believing in ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would not let them down . With their support , ProtagonistA was confident that ProtagonistA could achieve anything ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to . 
ProtagonistA set out for the farm at the end of the summer to take ProtagonistA's share of the stock ProtagonistA had bought with ProtagonistA's father 's money , which , in the course of the last year , had increased to three millions of dollars , and which , at the time that Mr. George J. Heard stood in the door of ProtagonistA's father 's house , had formed a considerable material interest . ProtagonistA had not been at the farm since ProtagonistA was a child , and ProtagonistA was looking forward to the trip with a mixture of excitement and trepidation . As ProtagonistA drove up to the farmhouse , ProtagonistA was relieved to see that it looked just as ProtagonistA remembered it . ProtagonistA was greeted by the farm manager , Mr. Johnson , who showed ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's room . After ProtagonistA had settled in , ProtagonistA went down to the barn to see the animals . ProtagonistA was pleased to see that the farm had flourished in ProtagonistA's absence and that the stock was healthy and happy . The next morning , ProtagonistA set out to explore the farm . ProtagonistA walked through the fields , admiring the crops and the view . As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and contentment come over ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA realized that this was where ProtagonistA belonged and that ProtagonistA had been foolish to ever leave . ProtagonistA spent the rest of the summer working on the farm and getting to know the people who worked there . By the time ProtagonistA left , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had finally come home . 
There was once ProtagonistA , no matter what ProtagonistA tried to do in life , ProtagonistA just could n't seem to get ahead . ProtagonistA had a good job , but ProtagonistA's bills always seemed to be one step ahead of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA tried to save money , but it never seemed to last very long . ProtagonistA even tried to get a better job , but it seemed like the only jobs available were ones that paid less than ProtagonistA was already making . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was stuck in a never - ending cycle of just getting by . 
When the day of a third world war comes , ProtagonistA has ProtagonistA's minders ready to give ProtagonistA permission to start it . When the full might of the Third Reich is at ProtagonistA's command , that is how I know I am going to die . I am a soldier in the Allied forces , and I know that we are no match for the Nazis . We will be slaughtered . 
ProtagonistA blinked , now that ProtagonistA had fully recovered from the overwhelming sense of relief during the dance as the nine people who had been invited to the ball had all been eliminated , and ProtagonistA was sitting with ProtagonistA's back arched and ProtagonistA's head hanging down , and ProtagonistA thought for a moment about what ProtagonistA was going to say in the next few moments .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA began ,  ProtagonistA know you all must be wondering why ProtagonistA invited you here , and ProtagonistA 'm sorry to say that ProtagonistA ca n't tell you . Just know that it was nothing personal , and ProtagonistA hope you can all forgive ProtagonistA .  With that , ProtagonistA stood up and walked out of the room , leaving the stunned guests behind . 
ProtagonistA had promised to give ProtagonistB a birthday party , and on the morning of the birthday , ProtagonistB had the party laid out for ProtagonistA . However , when ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's room to give ProtagonistB the present , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistB had passed away in ProtagonistB's sleep . ProtagonistA was devastated , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would want ProtagonistA to carry on with the party . So ProtagonistA did , and it was a beautiful tribute to ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a strange child . ProtagonistA was never quite like the other kids ProtagonistA's age and ProtagonistA always seemed to be in ProtagonistA's own world . So , when ProtagonistA died suddenly at the age of six , nobody was really all that surprised . But the strange thing was , nobody knew how long ProtagonistA had been dead . ProtagonistA had lived in a certain house in the churchyard when ProtagonistA was six or seven and ProtagonistA's body was found in the same house , but there was no sign of any foul play . The coroner ruled it as an accidental death , but the police could n't quite figure out how ProtagonistA had died . And so , ProtagonistA's death remains a mystery to this day . 
The first time I met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was walking along the banks of the Ostrich in the same town where ProtagonistA had been born and high - born . ProtagonistA had been living a long life , old and gray and in love . ProtagonistA was walking with ProtagonistA's husband , who was also old and gray and in love . They had been married for fifty years , and they were still madly in love with each other . They walked along the banks of the river , hand in hand , and they stopped to watch the sunset . It was a beautiful sunset , and they were both filled with the joy of being alive and in love . 
ProtagonistA came on slowly , but ProtagonistA was vigorous and determined . ProtagonistA had a goal in mind , and ProtagonistA was going to achieve it no matter what . ProtagonistA was determined to succeed , and ProtagonistA did . 
ProtagonistA had not expected to get anything from this world , but ProtagonistA had not been particularly surprised , either . ProtagonistA had lived a long and happy life , and ProtagonistA was content with what ProtagonistA had . Still , when ProtagonistA saw the beautiful necklace lying on ProtagonistA's bedside table , ProtagonistA could not help but be pleased . It was obviously very old and very valuable , and ProtagonistA knew that it must have come from ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB had left it for ProtagonistA to find , and ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistB's thoughtfulness . ProtagonistA would treasure it always . 
A whirlwind of joy washed over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistB took the first step of the day . It was the first time ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB since ProtagonistB had been diagnosed with cancer , and ProtagonistA was so happy to see ProtagonistB up and about . ProtagonistA ran to ProtagonistB and gave ProtagonistB a big hug .  ProtagonistA 'm so glad ProtagonistB 're feeling better , ProtagonistB !  ProtagonistA said . 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who lived in a small town . ProtagonistA was always dreaming of adventures and of finding treasures . One day , ProtagonistA heard a rumor that there was a flying horse in the nearby forest . ProtagonistA immediately set out to find it . After a long search , ProtagonistA finally found the horse . It was a beautiful creature , full of jewels and with a fine head of hair . ProtagonistA was delighted . The horse was very friendly and seemed to understand everything ProtagonistA said . It offered to take ProtagonistA on a ride and ProtagonistA eagerly accepted . The horse flew high into the sky and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream . ProtagonistA could see the whole town below ProtagonistA and it looked so small . The horse flew higher and higher until they reached the clouds . ProtagonistA was amazed at the sight . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in another world . The horse then took ProtagonistA to a magical kingdom where ProtagonistA met many wonderful creatures . ProtagonistA had the time of ProtagonistA's life and when ProtagonistA finally returned home , ProtagonistA was a changed person . ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA true calling in life and ProtagonistA was determined to follow ProtagonistA's dreams . 
ProtagonistA had been walking by the morgue for weeks , ever since ProtagonistB's body had been found there . ProtagonistA had never seen a dead body before and ProtagonistA was curious . ProtagonistA stopped by the front of the morgue and asked if ProtagonistA should look into the morgue . The attendant told ProtagonistA that it was up to ProtagonistA , but warned ProtagonistA that it could be a bit gruesome . ProtagonistA decided to go in . ProtagonistA was surprised at how clean and well - lit the inside of the morgue was . There were rows of bodies , all covered in white sheets . ProtagonistA walked down the aisle , looking at each body . Some of them looked peaceful , as if they were just sleeping . Others looked like they had been through a lot of pain before they died . ProtagonistA was about to leave when ProtagonistA saw a body that ProtagonistA recognized . It was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was surprised at how different ProtagonistB looked . ProtagonistB had always been so full of life , and now ProtagonistB just looked like a shell of ProtagonistB's former self . ProtagonistA turned to leave , but not before ProtagonistA said a silent goodbye to ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA could n't have been more than ten years old when ProtagonistA rose to break ProtagonistA's neck in the family crypt . It was a tragic accident , and ProtagonistA's parents were devastated . They had never wanted ProtagonistA to go into the crypt , but ProtagonistA had been curious about it and snuck in when they were n't looking . Now ProtagonistA was gone , and they would never see ProtagonistA again . 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's living room , reading a book . ProtagonistA was enjoying the quiet afternoon , when ProtagonistA suddenly heard the sound of children playing flute . The music was so beautiful and joyful that it brought a smile to ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA got up from ProtagonistA's chair and went to the window to see where the music was coming from . ProtagonistA saw a group of children playing together in a park . They were all laughing and having a great time . As ProtagonistA watched them , ProtagonistA felt a sudden flash of inspiration . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA wanted to learn how to play the flute . It was a surprising decision for ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistA was determined to learn . ProtagonistA went to the park the next day and asked the children if they could teach ProtagonistA how to play . They were happy to help , and before long , ProtagonistA was playing the flute along with them . The flash of inspiration that came over ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA heard the children playing flute was a surprise to ProtagonistA . But it was a happy surprise , one that led ProtagonistA to a new hobby and a new group of friends . 
There was ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA saw a rabbit and followed it into a hole . ProtagonistA fell down a rabbit hole and ended up in a strange place . 
ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistC years ago , and ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB since . ProtagonistA always wondered what had happened to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA never asked ProtagonistC about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA did n't want to upset ProtagonistC . One day , when ProtagonistA was an adult , ProtagonistA decided to ask ProtagonistC what had happened to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistC's face softened and ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA the truth . ProtagonistB 's not even ProtagonistA's father anymore ,  ProtagonistC croaked .  ProtagonistB left us when ProtagonistA were just a baby . ProtagonistC do n't know where ProtagonistB is now , and ProtagonistC do n't care . ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA had always thought ProtagonistB had just abandoned ProtagonistC , but it turns out ProtagonistB had actually left ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't know what to say or how to feel . Later that day , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's house . ProtagonistA had always known where ProtagonistB lived , but ProtagonistA had never had the courage to go there . Now that ProtagonistA knew the truth , ProtagonistA wanted to confront ProtagonistB . When ProtagonistA knocked on the door , ProtagonistB answered . ProtagonistB looked surprised to see ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB invited ProtagonistA in . ProtagonistA sat down and asked ProtagonistB why ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC all those years ago . ProtagonistB looked sad and regretful as ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA the truth . ProtagonistB was young and stupid ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB did n't know how to be a husband or a father . ProtagonistB 'm sorry ProtagonistB hurt ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB hope ProtagonistA can forgive ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA could ever forgive ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had finally found the answers ProtagonistA was looking for . 
ProtagonistA made a small , relatively uncommitted appearance at the door of the former home of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did not allow ProtagonistB to remain there . ProtagonistA had been warned by ProtagonistA's friends not to go near the place , but ProtagonistA had been curious and wanted to see it for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB had been living there alone since ProtagonistB's husband 's death , and ProtagonistA could not help but feel a little sorry for ProtagonistB . However , ProtagonistA did not want to get too close to ProtagonistB , as ProtagonistB seemed unstable and dangerous . 
ProtagonistA stood before ProtagonistA's desk one sunny day in August and looked over the papers that ProtagonistA held in ProtagonistA's magic hand . ProtagonistA was about to start ProtagonistA's new job as a teacher at the local elementary school and ProtagonistA was very excited . The papers contained the names of all the students in ProtagonistA's class . ProtagonistA was just about to start reading them when ProtagonistA heard a voice behind ProtagonistA . Excuse me , ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB standing in the doorway . Yes ?  ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistB name is Lizzy and ProtagonistB 'm in ProtagonistA's class ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB just wanted to say hello and welcome ProtagonistA to our school . Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said , smiled , and then turned back to ProtagonistA's papers . But as ProtagonistA started to read the names , ProtagonistA could n't help but think about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA wondered what the rest of the students in ProtagonistA's class would be like . Would they be as friendly as ProtagonistB ? ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA would find out soon enough . 
ProtagonistA came to ProtagonistA through the bar , and ProtagonistA – opened ProtagonistA's eyes – saw the world entirely different from the way it was . ProtagonistA was in a dark , dank place , with creatures that ProtagonistA had never seen before . ProtagonistA was scared , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . Then , ProtagonistA saw a light , and ProtagonistA started to walk towards it . ProtagonistA did n't know what was at the end of the light , but ProtagonistA knew that it was better than where ProtagonistA was . As ProtagonistA got closer to the light , ProtagonistA started to see people , and they were all different colors . ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was going on . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was in a different world , and that ProtagonistA was the only one who could save them . 
ProtagonistB was an apprentice to ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA came to the Yard as a gentle visitor . ProtagonistA was kind and always had a smile for ProtagonistB , even when ProtagonistB made mistakes . Over time , ProtagonistB came to admire ProtagonistA more and more , and eventually fell in love with ProtagonistA . However , ProtagonistB never told ProtagonistA how ProtagonistB felt , knowing that ProtagonistA was not interested in ProtagonistB in that way . ProtagonistB was content to just be near ProtagonistA and to help ProtagonistA in any way ProtagonistB could . One day , ProtagonistA came to the Yard with a serious look on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had to leave and would not be able to come back . ProtagonistB was heartbroken , but ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB could not stop ProtagonistA from going . ProtagonistB wished ProtagonistA all the best and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would always love ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA smiled and thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's kindness . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB and that ProtagonistB had helped to make ProtagonistA's time at the Yard special . Then ProtagonistA was gone , and ProtagonistB was left alone with only ProtagonistB's memories of ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB would never forget ProtagonistA , even though ProtagonistA was gone from ProtagonistB's life . 
ProtagonistA was fourteen years old and ProtagonistC was a cold , hard - working , lonely widow who had no business putting ProtagonistA into such a bizarre situation . ProtagonistA had been working at the local grocery store for the past year , and ProtagonistA was due for a promotion . But when ProtagonistB found out that ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's daughter , ProtagonistB demoted ProtagonistA and gave ProtagonistA a pay cut . ProtagonistC was furious . ProtagonistC took ProtagonistA out of the store and told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA was never going to work in a grocery store again . It was then that ProtagonistA realized how cold and hard ProtagonistC really was . 
When ProtagonistA heard that the fleet of the ministry of war was approaching , in Norfolk , the port of Southampton , ProtagonistA immediately ordered its repair . The workers scrambled to do ProtagonistA's bidding , and soon the fleet was in tip - top shape . They set sail for the enemy port , and ProtagonistA watched from the deck as they destroyed the enemy ships . It was a glorious victory , and one that would not have been possible without ProtagonistA's quick thinking . 
ProtagonistA is a handsome , lanky fellow , with a black beard and a black - rimmed eye , and ProtagonistA is a very good man , for all the good ProtagonistA has done . ProtagonistA has been a friend to many , and has helped them in their time of need . ProtagonistA is always there for ProtagonistA's friends , and they know they can count on ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had the misfortune to be born in a large and well - ordered house on which ProtagonistA had been born and reared , and which ProtagonistA's grandfather had purchased for a gift for ProtagonistA . The house was full of rooms and ProtagonistA had the misfortune of being the only child . As a result , ProtagonistA was often left to ProtagonistA's own devices and became quite imaginative . One day , while exploring the attic , ProtagonistA discovered a dusty old trunk . Inside was a beautiful dress , a tiara , and a pair of glass slippers . ProtagonistA put on the dress and twirled around the attic . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard someone coming up the stairs . It was ProtagonistB was not pleased to see ProtagonistA in the attic wearing an old dress . ProtagonistB scolded ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA to take it off . But ProtagonistA was determined to wear the dress and so ProtagonistA ran away from home . ProtagonistA did n't get very far before ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's shoes behind . ProtagonistA went back to the house to get ProtagonistA's shoes and that 's when ProtagonistA saw the most amazing sight . The glass slippers were gone ! In their place were a pair of dirty old shoes . ProtagonistA put on the shoes and went back to the attic to find the dress . But the dress was gone too ! All that was left was a dusty old trunk . 
ProtagonistA was down in the basement preparing to play ProtagonistA's music in a small VCR when ProtagonistB called ProtagonistA over . ProtagonistA had been planning to play ProtagonistA's music for hours , and now ProtagonistA would have to stop . ProtagonistA was so angry that ProtagonistA almost did n't go upstairs , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to . When ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistB was on the phone , and ProtagonistB motioned for ProtagonistA to come over . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA's parents had been in an accident and ProtagonistA had to go to the hospital . ProtagonistA was so shocked that ProtagonistA did n't know what to say . ProtagonistB hung up the phone and told ProtagonistA to pack a bag for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB would take ProtagonistA to the hospital to see ProtagonistA's parents . ProtagonistA did as ProtagonistA was told , and soon they were on their way . At the hospital , ProtagonistA's parents were in the intensive care unit . They were both hooked up to machines and they looked very pale . ProtagonistA was so scared that ProtagonistA started to cry . ProtagonistB comforted ProtagonistA and said that ProtagonistA's parents were going to be all right . ProtagonistA did n't believe ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA wanted to . ProtagonistA sat with ProtagonistA's parents all night , holding their hands and praying for them to wake up . 
When I first met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was a respectable college student . ProtagonistA was well known in the neighborhood for being a member of the Acobalt House , or  House of the Green - Bears .  This was a house belonging to a wealthy family in the neighborhood , and it was very easy to get into . The only difficult part was that it was located in the middle of a wide and commodious country . This made it a delicate and delicate occupation in those days . 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's garden , watching ProtagonistA's fowls , and ProtagonistA talked to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was very happy . ProtagonistA was telling ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's day , and how ProtagonistA had found a four - leaf clover . ProtagonistA said that it was a sign of good luck , and ProtagonistA was sure that it would bring ProtagonistA's luck . ProtagonistB was very interested in what ProtagonistA had to say , and ProtagonistB was very pleased to have been able to meet ProtagonistA . 
One lovely day ProtagonistA was walking through the meadow and up to ProtagonistA's house . ProtagonistA had a basket of flowers in ProtagonistA's hand and a big smile on ProtagonistA's face . The sun was shining and the birds were singing . It was a perfect day . When ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's house , ProtagonistA put the basket of flowers down on the porch and went inside . 
ProtagonistA was walking through the park when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on a bench , reading a book . ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and asked ,  Excuse ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB , but is ProtagonistA the Son of God ?  ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA , surprised , and said ,  Why , yes , ProtagonistA is !  
ProtagonistA did not know it then , but ProtagonistA was about to leave ProtagonistA's life behind . ProtagonistA was about to embark on a journey that would take ProtagonistA to a new world , a world ProtagonistA never could have imagined . ProtagonistA was about to meet new friends , and discover new things about ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was about to have the time of ProtagonistA's life . 
On the morning when ProtagonistA awoke , ProtagonistA stood in the garden , carrying ProtagonistA's trunk of books . It was a beautiful day , and the sun was just peeking over the horizon . ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and contentment . ProtagonistA had always loved books , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to have the time to read them all . ProtagonistA was going to start ProtagonistA's own library . 
ProtagonistA was an ugly boy , and ProtagonistA knew it . ProtagonistA just wanted to be loved . ProtagonistA thought that if ProtagonistA could find someone to love ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA would finally be happy . ProtagonistA went through life looking for that one person , but ProtagonistA never found them . ProtagonistA was always left feeling empty and alone . One day , ProtagonistA decided to give up . ProtagonistA stopped looking for love and just focused on living ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA was happier this way . ProtagonistA was finally able to love ProtagonistA , and that was all that mattered . 
ProtagonistA was one of those who , during the last days of ProtagonistA's life , fled into the great jungles of the interior of North America . ProtagonistA was never heard of again and is presumed to have perished under the gloomy and deadly care of a race of cannibals . Dr. Ketch said this was one of the many frightful transactions of the last years of his life . 
There was once Alice -- a man so heavy that ProtagonistA could lift practically anything on the planet , including the remains of large , extinct dinosaurs , and yet so light that even the weight of a small dog was sufficient to lift ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a gentle giant , and everyone who met ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the park when ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was shaking and terrified , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to help . ProtagonistA scooped up ProtagonistB and carried ProtagonistB home , where ProtagonistA nursed ProtagonistB back to health . ProtagonistB , became ProtagonistA's best friend . Wherever ProtagonistA went , ProtagonistB went too . And ProtagonistA was happy to have someone to love who loved ProtagonistA back just as much . 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw Miss Fortune .  It 's a pity , ProtagonistA ,  said Miss Fortune .  It 's a pity ProtagonistA did n't go and see if ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle had any clothes left .  ProtagonistA was about to say something when Miss Fortune continued .  They might have had some clothes left that would have fit ProtagonistA . But now ProtagonistA 'll never know .  
ProtagonistA was having a terrible time trying to get the Flying Feline to work . ProtagonistA had been at it for hours , and was getting frustrated . The Feline was supposed to be a new type of flying vehicle that was supposed to be much easier to use than the old ones . But so far , ProtagonistA was not having any luck . Finally , ProtagonistA lost ProtagonistA's temper and started barking at the Feline .  No , no , no ! Barked ProtagonistA , ahem , ahem , as ProtagonistA swished the infernal Flying Feline to and fro on the water . But even ProtagonistA's yelling and swearing could n't get the Feline to work . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA suddenly heard a voice behind ProtagonistA . Excuse ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB think ProtagonistB can help ProtagonistA with that . ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB standing there . ProtagonistB was holding a small device in ProtagonistB's hand . What is that ?  ProtagonistA asked . It 's a remote control . ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA struggling with the Feline and thought ProtagonistA might need some help . ProtagonistA was skeptical , but ProtagonistA was also desperate . ProtagonistA agreed to let ProtagonistB help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA how to use the remote , and soon ProtagonistA was flying around the lake with ease . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB ProtagonistB's name . ProtagonistB name is Harry ,  ProtagonistB said .  And ProtagonistA 're welcome .  
ProtagonistA began to feel guilty when ProtagonistA was twelve . ProtagonistA had been caught stealing a candy bar from the local convenience store . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was wrong and that ProtagonistA would have to face the consequences . ProtagonistA was scared of what ProtagonistA's parents would say or do . When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA confessed to ProtagonistA's parents what ProtagonistA had done . They were disappointed in ProtagonistA , but they did n't punish ProtagonistA . They told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to learn from ProtagonistA's mistake and that they were there to help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was relieved and grateful . ProtagonistA learned ProtagonistA's lesson and never stole again . 
ProtagonistA was fifteen when ProtagonistA had a dream in which ProtagonistA was swimming in a vast blue and white ocean . Vast and billowy black things fluttered gently and softly in the calm breeze . ProtagonistA could feel the warmth of the sun on ProtagonistA's skin and the coolness of the water around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt free and alive in the dream , and ProtagonistA woke up feeling refreshed and invigorated . 
ProtagonistA was a child of ProtagonistA's time , but like all true children of ProtagonistA's time ProtagonistA's mother died when ProtagonistA was eight . ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB could not fill the void that ProtagonistA's mother 's death had left in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA grew up to be a beautiful and talented young woman , but ProtagonistA always felt that something was missing . When ProtagonistA was twenty - five , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC's name was John , and ProtagonistC was everything ProtagonistA had ever dreamed of . ProtagonistC was kind , gentle , and loving , and ProtagonistC treated ProtagonistA like a queen . They were married a year later , and ProtagonistA finally felt that ProtagonistA had found what ProtagonistA had been searching for all ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's true home . 
ProtagonistA huffed , but ProtagonistA did n't puff . ProtagonistA was getting tired of walking , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep going . ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA was starting to get hungry . ProtagonistA had packed a lunch , but ProtagonistA had left it at home . ProtagonistA had been so excited to go on ProtagonistA's hike that ProtagonistA had forgotten to grab it . ProtagonistA was regretting ProtagonistA's decision to go on this hike alone . ProtagonistA had wanted to get away from people for a while , but now ProtagonistA was wishing ProtagonistA had someone with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was getting scared and ProtagonistA wanted to go home . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was getting close to the end of the trail , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA could make it . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw the end of the trail . ProtagonistA was so relieved and happy that ProtagonistA started to run . ProtagonistA made it to ProtagonistA's car and drove home . ProtagonistA was never going to go on a hike alone again . 
ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was not long for this world . ProtagonistA had been diagnosed with a terminal illness and was told that ProtagonistA only had a few months to live . In order to leave something behind , ProtagonistA decided to start a diary . ProtagonistA called it the Lazenby 's Diary , after ProtagonistA's favorite author . Every day , ProtagonistA would write in ProtagonistA's diary . ProtagonistA would write about ProtagonistA's day - to - day life , ProtagonistA's thoughts , ProtagonistA's feelings , and anything else that was on ProtagonistA's mind . As the days went by , ProtagonistA became more and more depressed . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's time was running out and there was nothing ProtagonistA could do to stop it . The Lazenby 's Diary became a sad and melancholy record of ProtagonistA's final days . ProtagonistA wrote about ProtagonistA slowly wasting away body , ProtagonistA's increasing pain , and ProtagonistA's loneliness . As ProtagonistA's health deteriorated , so did ProtagonistA's writing . The last few entries in the diary were barely legible , written in a shaky hand by ProtagonistA . And then , one day , ProtagonistA stopped writing altogether . The Lazenby 's Diary ended with a sad and poignant record of a woman 's life , cut short by an incurable disease . 
ProtagonistA is at a party with ProtagonistA's friends . They are all laughing and having a good time . ProtagonistA is wearing a beautiful dress and ProtagonistA's hair is done up in a pretty style . ProtagonistA looks like a princess . ProtagonistA's friends are all jealous of ProtagonistA and they all want to be ProtagonistA's friend . 
ProtagonistA had such a huge view of the sea that ProtagonistA's mind seemed to be made up of seas : the wide , deep sheets that covered the vast north and south coasts , the black , under - sea channels that ran behind and in front of the archipelago , the glen which jutted out into the horizon to give a vast , rounded and sheltered edifice , and from which the narrow , narrow passages into the bowels of the ship , lined with luxuriant heather , sheltered the crew ; and the skies above all , where the blue - grey stars shone in their true blue glory , and the red stars which now flapped and twinkled in the night , of the moon and the stars , were all dreams to ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was a young woman living in England in 1659 . ProtagonistA was struck down by a single assassin in Munich , who then killed ProtagonistA . This event caused great shock and sadness in England , as ProtagonistA was a much - loved member of the royal family . 
ProtagonistA was walking through the park when ProtagonistA was hit by a bolt of lightning . ProtagonistA fell to the ground , unconscious . When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in the body of a child . ProtagonistA did n't know how it had happened , but ProtagonistA was glad to be alive . ProtagonistA went to the nearest house and knocked on the door . A man answered and ProtagonistA asked to use his phone . ProtagonistA called ProtagonistA's parents and they came to pick ProtagonistA up . They were shocked to see ProtagonistA in the body of a child , but they were happy to have ProtagonistA back . 
ProtagonistA did not like to be disturbed , and ProtagonistA would not have it otherwise . ProtagonistA was a very private person , and ProtagonistA cherished ProtagonistA's alone time . When ProtagonistA was disturbed , ProtagonistA would usually just ignore the person or thing that was disturbing ProtagonistA . However , there were times when ProtagonistA could n't ignore it . There were times when the disturbance was just too much for ProtagonistA . When this happened , ProtagonistA would usually lash out at the person or thing that was disturbing ProtagonistA . This would usually result in the person or thing being scared off or getting hurt . 
ProtagonistA had a name for a machine that could change the course of the storm , but ProtagonistA never named it . It was ProtagonistA's secret , ProtagonistA's weapon against the darkness that threatened to consume ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA built it in the basement of ProtagonistA's house , using scraps of metal and bits of wire ProtagonistA scavenged from the junkyard . It was a crude thing , but it worked . ProtagonistA tested it on days when the storm was brewing , and it always worked . The machine was ProtagonistA's only hope against the darkness . 
ProtagonistA was sound asleep when ProtagonistA was suddenly awoken by a noise . ProtagonistA sat up in bed and listened , but all was quiet . ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to the window to see if there was anything there , but there was nothing . ProtagonistA was about to go back to bed when ProtagonistA heard the noise again , this time it sounded like it was coming from outside . ProtagonistA got dressed quickly and went outside to see what was going on . It was the dead of night , and the only light was coming from the moon . ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB in the distance , and ProtagonistB was coming towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was about to go back inside when ProtagonistB spoke . ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA's help ,  ProtagonistB said . ProtagonistA was surprised to hear ProtagonistB talk , but ProtagonistA did n't know what to say . Who are ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked . ProtagonistB name is John , and ProtagonistB 'm a traveller . ProtagonistB 'm looking for a place to stay for the night , but ProtagonistB ca n't find one . Can ProtagonistA help ProtagonistA was hesitant , but ProtagonistA did n't want to leave ProtagonistB out in the cold . Yes , ProtagonistB can stay with ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistB was relieved and thanked ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB inside and got ProtagonistB a drink . So , where are ProtagonistB travelling to ?  ProtagonistA asked . ProtagonistB going to the city ,  ProtagonistB said . What 's in the city?I'm looking for a new life ,  ProtagonistB said . ProtagonistA was curious and wanted to know more , but ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was tired . You can tell ProtagonistA all about it in the morning ,  ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA and went to bed . ProtagonistA lay awake for a while , thinking about ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's journey . ProtagonistA was excited to hear more about it in the morning . 
ProtagonistA's life had been much the same since ProtagonistA had first stood on a sleeping bag and walked through the night . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner , preferring the company of ProtagonistA's books to that of people . But when ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA in the woods that night , ProtagonistA had been surprised to find another person there . ProtagonistA had been even more surprised when that person had turned out to be ProtagonistB . But since that night , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had become fast friends . ProtagonistA would visit ProtagonistB in the woods every night , and they would spend hours talking . ProtagonistA had never been so happy . But one night , ProtagonistA arrived in the woods to find that ProtagonistB was gone . ProtagonistA searched for ProtagonistB for hours , but ProtagonistB was nowhere to be found . ProtagonistA was heartbroken . But the next night , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance . It sounded like ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA followed the noise until ProtagonistA came to a clearing , and there ProtagonistB was . ProtagonistB had been hurt , and ProtagonistB needed ProtagonistA's help . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could never let ProtagonistB go again . ProtagonistA nursed ProtagonistB back to health , and from then on , they remained together . ProtagonistA had finally found the companionship ProtagonistA had always been searching for . 
ProtagonistA had always been a go - getter . ProtagonistA was never content to sit idly by and let life pass ProtagonistA by . So , when ProtagonistA was faced with a difficult challenge , ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to take it on . ProtagonistA was currently in the middle of a tough project at work . ProtagonistA was determined to see it through to the end , no matter what . So , when ProtagonistA was faced with a difficult task , ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to take it on . ProtagonistA worked tirelessly , never stopping until ProtagonistA was finished . And , when ProtagonistA was finally done , ProtagonistA looked back with a sense of satisfaction . It 's well ,  said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA strode purposefully into the room . 
ProtagonistA was the most beautiful girl in the world , and ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA with all of ProtagonistB's heart . So when ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB to kill ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB did n't hesitate . ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA into ProtagonistB's arms and kissed ProtagonistA gently , then slit ProtagonistA's throat . As ProtagonistA bled out , ProtagonistA smiled and thanked ProtagonistB . 
On the night when the corpse of Alice was found , ProtagonistA , died , a very unhappy death , which was neither premeditated nor foreseen . It was a great shock to all who knew ProtagonistA , for ProtagonistA had always been a kind and gentle lady , loved by all who met ProtagonistA . But on that fateful night , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistA's end at the hands of ProtagonistA's own son . 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's hospital bed , hooked up to machines that beeped and whirred around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA could hear the nurses talking in hushed tones outside ProtagonistA's door , and ProtagonistA knew they were talking about ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was going to die . ProtagonistA could feel it in ProtagonistA's bones . ProtagonistA was going to die and ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistA's family again . ProtagonistA's last thoughts were of them , and ProtagonistA wondered if they would be okay without ProtagonistA . 
On the afternoon of February 21st , 1780 , I was travelling with ProtagonistA , through the streets and alleys of London , when ProtagonistA suddenly passed me in a room in the Campus of Trinity College . I followed ProtagonistA in , and saw that ProtagonistA was reading an article in the New - York Tribune . We talked for a while about the news , and then continued on our journey to Eton . 
Quietly ProtagonistA observed that ProtagonistB was the very picture of quiet and serene . It was as if the world around ProtagonistB was a calm oasis and ProtagonistB was the only one who could see it . ProtagonistA felt envious of ProtagonistB's ability to find such peace in the midst of chaos . ProtagonistA wondered what it would be like to feel that way ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA went over to the wharf , where three anchor - ships stood ready to receive ProtagonistA . The first ship was a beautiful vessel with billowing white sails . The second ship was a large , sturdy ship with a black flag . The third ship was a small , rusty ship with a broken mast . ProtagonistA boarded the first ship and set sail for ProtagonistA's adventure . 
There is something about ProtagonistA that makes ProtagonistA's body speak to us ; and ProtagonistA's voice makes us feel at once like ProtagonistA was there . We can feel ProtagonistA's presence in the room , even when ProtagonistA 's not there . ProtagonistA's voice is like a warm blanket , wrapping us up in its comforting embrace . We ca n't help but feel drawn to ProtagonistA , even though we do n't know why . There 's something about ProtagonistA that just makes us feel at ease , like we 've known ProtagonistA for years . 
ProtagonistA was a bit of a eccentric . ProtagonistA was always coming up with new and interesting ideas , but ProtagonistA's latest one was by far the most bizarre . ProtagonistA convinced ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was immortal . At first , ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA was joking . But ProtagonistB soon realized that ProtagonistA was serious . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would never age and would never die . ProtagonistB was amazed . ProtagonistB did n't know what to think . Was ProtagonistA telling the truth ? Or was ProtagonistA just trying to play a trick on ProtagonistB ? ProtagonistB decided to ask ProtagonistA for proof . ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB a picture of ProtagonistA from when ProtagonistA was a child . ProtagonistA looked exactly the same as ProtagonistA did now . ProtagonistB was convinced . ProtagonistA really was immortal . ProtagonistB was excited and scared all at the same time . ProtagonistB did n't know what it would mean for ProtagonistB's own life . But ProtagonistB was happy to have found out the truth . 
ProtagonistA had been having a long , hard day in the hospital wing when ProtagonistA suddenly had an accident . ProtagonistA called it an  insane accident  because ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never have been able to survive it otherwise . ProtagonistA was rushed to the intensive care unit and was in a coma for weeks . When ProtagonistA finally woke up , ProtagonistA was surprised to find that ProtagonistA was still alive . ProtagonistA was even more surprised to find that ProtagonistA was now a quadriplegic . 
ProtagonistA was eight years old when ProtagonistA heard the story and the story just was n't the same anymore . ProtagonistA had loved the story of the little girl who went to a magical place and had adventures with talking animals , but now that ProtagonistA was older , ProtagonistA could see the holes in the story . The logic did n't make sense , and the characters were too two - dimensional . ProtagonistA was disappointed , but ProtagonistA supposed that was just what happened when you grew up . 
ProtagonistA had been locked in ProtagonistA's room for days , with no food or water . The only light came from the golden door , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA must get out if ProtagonistA was going to live . ProtagonistA tried to remember the layout of the house , but it was hard to think clearly . ProtagonistA knew the door was ProtagonistA's only way out . ProtagonistA had to find a way to open it . ProtagonistA searched the room for something to help ProtagonistA , but there was nothing . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw a key on the floor . ProtagonistA picked it up and tried it in the door . It worked ! ProtagonistA opened the door and walked out into the sunlight . ProtagonistA was free ! 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's kitchen , puttering around and minding ProtagonistA's own business when ProtagonistA suddenly heard the doorbell ring . ProtagonistA smiled to ProtagonistA , thinking that maybe ProtagonistA's friends had come to surprise ProtagonistA with a visit . But when ProtagonistA peered into the hallway , ProtagonistA saw that it was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB explained that ProtagonistB had been hoping to purchase a piece of art from ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB was very sorry to see that ProtagonistA's work was not what ProtagonistB had hoped for . ProtagonistA was taken aback by ProtagonistB's words . ProtagonistA had never thought of ProtagonistA's paintings in that way before . ProtagonistA always just thought of them as pretty pictures that made people happy . But ProtagonistB's words made ProtagonistA think differently . ProtagonistA began to see ProtagonistA's paintings through ProtagonistB's eyes and ProtagonistA realized that maybe ProtagonistA was n't as good as ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was . This was a hard realization for ProtagonistA to come to , but it was one that ProtagonistA needed to face if ProtagonistA ever wanted to improve as an artist . 
ProtagonistA stood on the deck of the ship as the sun sank into the horizon , an unending gaze in which ProtagonistA had both contempt and fascination . ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the sea , but now ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA wondering what it would be like to be swallowed up by it . The thought of being consumed by the vastness of the ocean was both terrifying and intriguing . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never find out , but the thought still lingered in ProtagonistA's mind as ProtagonistA watched the sun disappear into the water . 
ProtagonistA had been put out of ProtagonistA's misery , but ProtagonistA had not been without a struggle for days ; ProtagonistA had actually considered ProtagonistA unlucky . The doctors had said that there was no hope , that ProtagonistA was going to die , and ProtagonistA had fought with all ProtagonistA's might to stay alive . But in the end , ProtagonistA was too weak and ProtagonistA passed away . ProtagonistA's family was there with ProtagonistA , and they were all relieved that ProtagonistA was no longer in pain . 
ProtagonistA is the best , for now . All that matters is that ProtagonistA feels loved and is acknowledged as such . Some of the time , ProtagonistA is n't always loved or acknowledged . But , that 's okay . ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA is loved , even if it is n't always shown . 
ProtagonistA was in the middle of ProtagonistA's interview when ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA's face was marked . ProtagonistA did n't have the faintest idea of how to make it look serious . ProtagonistA tried to keep a straight face , but the interviewer could tell that something was wrong . Finally , ProtagonistA just gave up and told the interviewer what was going on . ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA had been trying to make a serious face , but it just was n't working . The interviewer was sympathetic and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could try again next time . 
ProtagonistA was a woman of means who lived in a large house at the end of the last century . ProtagonistA was increasingly concerned about the state of ProtagonistA's house and the people who were prostituting it . ProtagonistA lost all patience with them and decided to take matters into ProtagonistA's own hands . ProtagonistA hired a group of workers to come and clean up ProtagonistA's house and make it livable again . It took them several months , but they eventually got the house back into shape . ProtagonistA was very pleased with the results and decided to stay in ProtagonistA's house for the rest of ProtagonistA's life . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit overweight , but ProtagonistA had never really cared . ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's body and loved to eat . However , when ProtagonistA turned 30 , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA needed to make a change . ProtagonistA started dieting and working out , and within a year , ProtagonistA had lost 50 pounds . ProtagonistA felt great and was finally happy with ProtagonistA's body . However , ProtagonistA's friends and family were not supportive of ProtagonistA's weight loss .

It was a quiet April afternoon , and perfectly to the good taste of the artist , who wanted to make a work out of his own life , that ProtagonistA passed through the doors of the Gallery of the Imperial Palace , and took up ProtagonistA's residence in a double - room with a balcony , and ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA in hand . The first thing ProtagonistB did was to set to work on a portrait of ProtagonistA . It was to be a three - quarter length , in a white dress , with ProtagonistA's hair down , and ProtagonistA was to sit in an arm - chair with ProtagonistA's feet on a stool . The whole thing was to have a kind of classical simplicity about it . ProtagonistB began to work at once , and ProtagonistA , watched ProtagonistB for a little while and then began to talk . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's life , and how ProtagonistA had always wanted to be an artist , and how ProtagonistA had been so disappointed when ProtagonistB had sent ProtagonistA to the Gallery . But why did ProtagonistA come here , if ProtagonistA did n't want to ?  asked ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA father said it was the only place for a lady to live ,  replied ProtagonistA .  But ProtagonistA do n't see why a lady should live any differently from other people . ProtagonistA should like to live in a studio , and have ProtagonistA's meals there , and work all day . But ProtagonistB is right ,  said ProtagonistB .  A lady can not live in a studio . It is not proper . I do n't see why not ,  persisted ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA am sure ProtagonistA could work just as well there as ProtagonistA can here . But it is not the done thing ,  said ProtagonistB .  A lady must always be proper . ProtagonistA was silent for a moment , and then ProtagonistA said :  ProtagonistA do n't see why being proper should make any difference to one 's work . ProtagonistA am sure ProtagonistA could be just as good an artist if ProtagonistA lived in a studio as ProtagonistA can here . ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA for a moment , and then ProtagonistB said :  ProtagonistA are quite right , ProtagonistA . Being proper does not make any difference to one 's work . But it is not the done thing for a lady to live in a studio . ProtagonistB is right . A lady must always be proper .

ProtagonistA's parents had always been poor , but they had never been unhappy . They were content with their lot in life and always made the best of what they had . However , when the war came , their contentment was shattered . ProtagonistA's father was drafted into the army and ProtagonistB was left to fend for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA . The sun rose slowly , but in the midst of all the misery of the city , which was then , and for a long time afterwards , a fine and flourishing town , there rose a little meek , innocent - looking girl of about sixteen or seventeen years of age , who seemed to have been driven into a very inconvenient position during the war ; and for the most part it was the fault of ProtagonistA's parents , who were not at all happy , poor , or otherwise about ProtagonistA , in the least .

ProtagonistA was wearing a pair of shorts and a tank top and ProtagonistA felt good about ProtagonistA . As ProtagonistA was walking , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was also middle - aged and pretty good looking . They smiled at each other as they passed and ProtagonistA felt a sudden surge of excitement .

ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner . ProtagonistA did n't have any close friends or family , and ProtagonistA was content with that . But on New Year 's Eve , ProtagonistA felt a sudden pang of loneliness . ProtagonistA decided to go out and celebrate the new year , even though ProtagonistA usually stayed in on nights like this . ProtagonistA went to a bar and had a few drinks , but ProtagonistA did n't stay out long . ProtagonistA wanted to be home before midnight so ProtagonistA could watch the fireworks from ProtagonistA's apartment . Less than an hour after the end of the year , ProtagonistA was found murdered in ProtagonistA's apartment , ProtagonistA's throat slit . It is still unknown who killed ProtagonistA or why . 
ProtagonistA was a fine , cheerful , cheerful girl of fifteen years of age , who had a cheerful manner , and good sense , but no very good sense ; and though ProtagonistA was wo nt to be a good - humoured and a happy - go - lucky girl , ProtagonistA was not without a certain air of melancholy . It was perhaps this which made ProtagonistA so attractive to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a widower , and ProtagonistA was the daughter of ProtagonistB's late wife 's sister . ProtagonistB had known ProtagonistA from ProtagonistA's childhood , and had always been fond of ProtagonistA . Now that ProtagonistA was grown up , ProtagonistB began to think of ProtagonistA more seriously , and to feel that ProtagonistA would make a suitable wife for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB spoke to ProtagonistA on the subject , and found that ProtagonistA was not averse to the idea . So they were married , and went to live in ProtagonistB's house at Oxford . ProtagonistA was very happy in ProtagonistA's new home , and made the best of everything . ProtagonistA was a good wife to ProtagonistB , and a loving mother to ProtagonistA's children .

And when it did , those who knew ProtagonistA's best said that they had never seen a happier death . 
ProtagonistA was three years old when ProtagonistA was brought to bay in the arms of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what was happening .

 Now , what is it ?  said the Doctor to the old woman who lay on Alice 's back in a critical state , trying to escape the vault with ProtagonistA's head down , as if ProtagonistA had suddenly realized what it was ProtagonistA had been planning .  It 's the TARDIS ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA was trying to get away from it .   And why would ProtagonistA want to do that ?  asked the Doctor .  It 's dangerous ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA ca n't control it .   I see ,  said the Doctor .  And ProtagonistA think that by getting away from it , ProtagonistA 'll be safe ?   Yes ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA have to try .   I 'm sorry , but I ca n't let ProtagonistA do that ,  said the Doctor .  The TARDIS is my responsibility .   Please ,  ProtagonistA said .  You do n't understand .   I 'm sorry ,  said the Doctor .  But I ca n't let ProtagonistA go .  
ProtagonistA lay on ProtagonistA's bed in the green garden of ProtagonistA's maternal grandmother 's , thinking of the wholesome things that a well - ordered house could do for the comfort of the mind and body , without the extra expense of a large house , or a great purchase of land , or any other thing of the kind ; and in consequence of these wholesome things , the mind and body improved so much , that from the time that ProtagonistA was quite able to think , ProtagonistA could form any idea , no matter how dim and conflicting , regarding any particular object or thing , unless absolutely absolutely necessary ; and ProtagonistA thus became a very pretty , and very intelligent , and very happy woman , and saved ProtagonistA's family much distress , expense , and trouble , and earned in itself a considerable profit . 
ProtagonistA sat down in the heather green armchair in ProtagonistA's little office and talked to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was feeling lost and confused , and ProtagonistA needed to figure out what to do next . ProtagonistA had always been a go - getter , but now ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was just spinning ProtagonistA's wheels . ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's options and decided to take a break . ProtagonistA needed to clear ProtagonistA's head and come up with a new plan . ProtagonistA got up from the armchair and went for a walk . As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's life and what ProtagonistA really wanted .

ProtagonistA was not sure what to do with the money , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would have to make some decisions soon . 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had been best friends since they were in diapers . They had been through everything together and there was nothing that ProtagonistA would n't do for ProtagonistB .

ProtagonistA decided to keep ProtagonistA's bed for a little while longer . But the lump got bigger and bigger , until it was the size of a soccer ball . ProtagonistA was so worried that ProtagonistA went to the doctor . The doctor took one look at the lump and said ,  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 've got a tumor .

After the surgery , ProtagonistA was feeling better . And ProtagonistA was happy to be able to sleep in ProtagonistA's own bed again . 
ProtagonistA was walking home from the grocery store when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking hand in hand with a dead man . ProtagonistA felt a strong urge to help , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if it was any of ProtagonistA's business . ProtagonistA could have easily gone either way , but ProtagonistA decided to help .

To Susan and Jethro 's mother — the widow of Captain Jonathan Smith — Mrs. Samantha Duryea , of the parsonage where ProtagonistA had been left and ProtagonistA's brother , Mr. Joseph Duryea , of the tower : It was a cold , dark night when ProtagonistA was left at the parsonage . ProtagonistA was only six years old , and ProtagonistA's brother was just a baby . Their mother had died in childbirth , and their father had died in the war . They were all alone in the world . The parsonage was a small , cramped house , and ProtagonistA was terrified of the dark . ProtagonistA huddled in a corner , trying to make ProtagonistA as small as possible , and prayed for morning to come . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise outside . It sounded like someone was climbing the tower . ProtagonistA was paralysed with fear , but ProtagonistA forced ProtagonistA to look out the window . Sure enough , there was ProtagonistB climbing the tower . ProtagonistB was wearing all black , and ProtagonistB had a rope around ProtagonistB's waist . ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistB was a thief . ProtagonistA was about to scream for help when ProtagonistA heard someone else climbing the tower . It was ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC had a rope around ProtagonistC's waist , too . ProtagonistA realised that these men were not thieves . They were climbers . And they were going to climb the tower in the dark . ProtagonistA watched as the men reached the top of the tower and started to rappel down the other side . It was an amazing sight . ProtagonistA was no longer afraid . ProtagonistA was mesmerised by the climbers and the tower . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget this night . 
ProtagonistA was lying upon the ground , ProtagonistA's arms stretched out in front of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's legs crossed , ProtagonistA's head resting on the side of ProtagonistA's hands . ProtagonistA felt the warmth of the sun on ProtagonistA's skin and the coolness of the grass beneath ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let out a deep breath . It was a perfect day . 
ProtagonistA's friends called ProtagonistA's squire , but ProtagonistA would not cast a glance aside , for ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistB was the kindest , most gentle man ProtagonistA had ever met , and ProtagonistA cherished ProtagonistB above all else . They had been married for five years , and in that time , ProtagonistB had never once raised ProtagonistB's voice to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was the luckiest woman alive . One day , ProtagonistB came home from work and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had been laid off . ProtagonistA could see the worry in ProtagonistB's eyes , but ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to reassure ProtagonistB . They would get through this , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB . Together , they would find a way . And find a way they did . ProtagonistA got a job as a waitress to help make ends meet , and ProtagonistB started doing odd jobs around the neighborhood . It was hard work , but they were happy . They were a team . Eventually , things started to look up . ProtagonistB found a new job , and they were able to start saving again . They were finally getting back on their feet . But then , tragedy struck . ProtagonistB was diagnosed with a terminal illness . There was nothing that could be done . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to make it through this . But ProtagonistA had to be strong . ProtagonistA had to be there for ProtagonistB . And ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA nursed ProtagonistB through ProtagonistB's final days , never leaving ProtagonistB's side . ProtagonistA was with ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB passed away , holding ProtagonistB's hand and telling ProtagonistB how much ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was heartbroken , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to go on . ProtagonistA had to honor ProtagonistB's memory by living ProtagonistA's life to the fullest . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would want that for ProtagonistA . And so , ProtagonistA did . 
We had just left ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's anchor in the water , when ProtagonistB , in a singular instance , which must have occurred to most of the passengers , jumped into the sea . We all screamed , but it was too late . ProtagonistB was gone . We did n't know what to do . We did n't know if we should turn back or keep going . We did n't know if ProtagonistB could swim or not . We did n't know anything . We just stood there , staring at the spot where ProtagonistB had disappeared . We were all in shock . We did n't know what to do or say . Finally , after what felt like an eternity , someone spoke up . We have to keep going ,  they said .  We ca n't turn back now . And so we did . We left ProtagonistB behind and kept going . We did n't know what else to do . 
One day in August , a winter in the West , ProtagonistA came to a village to pick up ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was excited to see ProtagonistA and ran to ProtagonistA with open arms . ProtagonistA hugged ProtagonistB tightly , tears streaming down ProtagonistA's face . It was a moment of happiness in a time of great sorrow . 
ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistC's head and down at ProtagonistA's feet and said ,  ProtagonistB , go on . ProtagonistB 'll be ProtagonistB's companion .  ProtagonistC had always been a bit of a mystery to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA had always been content to follow ProtagonistC . That is , until now . ProtagonistA was tired of being led around blindly and wanted to know what was going on .  Go on ,  ProtagonistA said again .  ProtagonistA 'll be right behind ProtagonistB .  And with that , ProtagonistA set off after ProtagonistC , determined to find out what ProtagonistC was up to . 
ProtagonistB had always been a bit overprotective , so when ProtagonistA started having strange dreams , ProtagonistB insisted on sleeping in ProtagonistA's room . That 's how ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA the night ProtagonistA rose from ProtagonistA's deepest sleep . The crowd of people below the palace were gathered around something , and when ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistB saw that it was ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was floating above them , ProtagonistA's eyes closed and a serene smile on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistB called out to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't respond . ProtagonistB reached for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was just out of reach . Then ProtagonistA slowly floated away , disappearing into the night . 
ProtagonistA had always loved the stars . ProtagonistA loved the way they twinkled and shone , and ProtagonistA loved the way they made ProtagonistA feel small .

One night , ProtagonistA went out to the beach to look at the stars . The sky was blue and black and vast with the stars , but ProtagonistA was pale and yellow and ProtagonistA's light was dim , casting a yellowish tinge over the sea of stars which stands above the earth . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to faint . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to fall into the sky . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to die . But then , something happened . ProtagonistA felt a hand on ProtagonistA's shoulder , and ProtagonistA felt someone else 's light shining next to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt safe . ProtagonistA turned to see who it was , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was shining just as bright as the stars , and ProtagonistB was smiling . I'm here , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'll always be here . ProtagonistA felt better then . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could stand up and face the stars again . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could face anything . ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's light in the darkness . 
ProtagonistA sat up all night , thinking about all the things ProtagonistA had seen . ProtagonistA had seen so many amazing things , and ProtagonistA was just getting started . ProtagonistA thought about the places ProtagonistA had been , and the people ProtagonistA had met .

One morning in October , 1890 , ProtagonistA came to the friend - house in the street called Beechmere Lane , with the sign over ProtagonistA's door :  To Let .  It was a tall , narrow house , with a high , pointed roof ; and ProtagonistA thought it looked very much like a church . ProtagonistA knocked at the door , and when ProtagonistB opened it , ProtagonistA asked for ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistC was not at home , but ProtagonistC would be back in an hour . ProtagonistA then asked if ProtagonistB could come in and wait for ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB could , and ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA into the parlour . There was a fire burning in the grate , and the room was very cozy . After a while , ProtagonistA began to feel sleepy , and ProtagonistA dozed off in ProtagonistA's chair . 
ProtagonistA was walking home from ProtagonistA's friend 's house when ProtagonistA dropped ProtagonistA's bag of toys on the ground . ProtagonistA looked up and saw a brick - and - mortar window with a two - foot - high gap in it . ProtagonistA could see into the room , and it looked like there was a party going on inside . ProtagonistA could hear laughter and music coming from the room , and ProtagonistA saw people dancing .

ProtagonistB , looked up at ProtagonistA with an expression of terror in ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB was about to kill ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB could n't bear the thought . But ProtagonistB had no choice ; ProtagonistB had to do as ProtagonistC ordered . ProtagonistC , looked down at the two of them with a satisfied smirk on ProtagonistC's face .

ProtagonistC knew that by making ProtagonistB kill ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC would not only be rid of ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistC would also break ProtagonistB's spirit , crushing any hope ProtagonistB had of ever being happy again .

ProtagonistA was tired and hungry , and ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was going . But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving . The room ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in was small and cramped , and it was filled with boxes and crates .

ProtagonistA ca n't just walk in here and take what ProtagonistA want . ProtagonistA did n't know what to say . ProtagonistA was scared and ProtagonistA did n't want to get in trouble . But ProtagonistA also did n't want to spend the rest of ProtagonistA's life in this tiny room . Please ,  ProtagonistA said .  Just let ProtagonistA go . ProtagonistA wo n't take anything . ProtagonistB considered ProtagonistA for a moment , and then ProtagonistB sighed . All right ,  ProtagonistB said .  But ProtagonistA have to promise ProtagonistB ProtagonistA 'll never come back .

ProtagonistA walked back into the house , feeling refreshed . It was nice to spend some time with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA should do it more often . 
ProtagonistA had been in ProtagonistA's cell for two days now . ProtagonistA was sentenced to life in prison for a crime ProtagonistA did n't commit . ProtagonistA was innocent , but nobody believed ProtagonistA . On the second day of ProtagonistA's incarceration , ProtagonistA could n't bear to get up from the bed ProtagonistA had been lying on for hours . ProtagonistA stayed in ProtagonistA's room for a few minutes , and then , without saying a word , ProtagonistA took one last deep breath and , as if nothing happened , let ProtagonistA go .

In the year 1853 , the week under which my brother , Mr. John , was born , ProtagonistA was induced to put a lock of his hair on his head ; and , while the ambassador but little doubted that ProtagonistA was well acted , yet ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA plainly and unmistakably perceived to be interested in the matter , which , however , ProtagonistA had never before encountered in ProtagonistA's life , and which ProtagonistA had never dreamed of any way , before that time , having , in fact no conception of the end or purpose of the conduct of ProtagonistA's affairs , been deceived into believing that they were spent , or that they were in proper hands . 
ProtagonistA was always fascinated by the ancient art of raising the dead . ProtagonistA had read all the books on the subject , and had even tried it a few times , but with no success . So , when ProtagonistA heard about the ' oldest work of art of all the earth ' , ProtagonistA was intrigued . ProtagonistA travelled to the ancient site where the artwork was said to be located . When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA saw a large stone tablet with an inscription on it . The inscription said ' Raise the dead with the power of art' . ProtagonistA was not sure what to do , but ProtagonistA decided to try it anyway . ProtagonistA placed ProtagonistA's hand on the tablet and concentrated ProtagonistA's power .

At the turn of the last century , when Europe was drifting apart , there lived ProtagonistA , and by the name of Caroline Caroline , or Caroline of Mary , ProtagonistA was called . ProtagonistA was born in England in 1887 to an aristocratic family , but ProtagonistA's parents died when ProtagonistA was young and ProtagonistA was sent to live with ProtagonistA's grandparents in France . ProtagonistA grew up in a chateau in the Loire Valley and finished ProtagonistA's education in a convent in Paris . When ProtagonistA was 21 , ProtagonistA married a French count and they had a daughter . But the marriage was not a happy one and after a few years they divorced . ProtagonistA moved back to England with ProtagonistA's daughter and started a new life . ProtagonistA began working as a governess and then as a teacher .

But ProtagonistA always gave them a happy ending . ProtagonistA's stories were very popular and ProtagonistA became a well - known writer . ProtagonistA also became friends with some of the most famous people of ProtagonistA's time , including the writer , Oscar Wilde . But despite ProtagonistA's success , ProtagonistA's life was not a happy one . ProtagonistA was always lonely and felt that ProtagonistA did n't belong anywhere . ProtagonistA died in 1932 , at the age of 45 . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bright girl , but ProtagonistA was never one for school . ProtagonistA was content to work at ProtagonistA's mom 's diner and live a simple life . The only reason ProtagonistA had never gone to college was that ProtagonistA did n't want to be thought of as dumb . But when ProtagonistA's mom died unexpectedly , ProtagonistA was left with no choice but to take over the diner . ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA was in over ProtagonistA's head . The only way to save the diner was to get a business degree . And so , ProtagonistA went to college . ProtagonistA was nervous at first , but ProtagonistA quickly made friends and excelled in ProtagonistA's classes . ProtagonistA even found a boyfriend . By the time ProtagonistA graduated , ProtagonistA was confident and successful . And ProtagonistA was proud to have proved everyone wrong . 
The day after ProtagonistA's engagement as an actress , ProtagonistA had a severe headache , and had to walk at all hours . ProtagonistA had been so excited to finally be able to make a career for ProtagonistA , but now ProtagonistA was starting to worry that it was all too much . ProtagonistA had never been good at handling stress , and now ProtagonistA was going to have to learn how to deal with it . ProtagonistA was also worried about the future . ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA was going to be able to handle being in the spotlight all the time . It was all so overwhelming . 
There is no such thing as ProtagonistA , but there is a pricetag which is often a price - tag of the costume which ProtagonistA wears . ProtagonistA is a figment of our imagination , created by our need for a storybook heroine . ProtagonistA is the personification of innocence and curiosity , two qualities which are often lacking in the modern world . We see ProtagonistA as a symbol of hope , a reminder that there is still magic and beauty in the world . Even though ProtagonistA is not real , ProtagonistA brings joy to our lives and reminds us of the possibilities that exist beyond our everyday reality . 
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA saw a strange light in the distance . ProtagonistA walked towards it and saw that it was coming from a lamp on a small platform in the center of the light . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA saw that there was a person sitting on the platform , and they were looking at ProtagonistA with a strange expression . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had seen this person before , but ProtagonistA could n't remember where . The person on the platform spoke to ProtagonistA in a language ProtagonistA did n't understand , but ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could understand it . ProtagonistA walked closer to the platform and sat down . The person spoke to ProtagonistA again , and this time ProtagonistA understood what they were saying . They were telling ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB , and how ProtagonistA could get there if ProtagonistA wanted to . ProtagonistA was intrigued by ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA asked the person how ProtagonistA could get there . They told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA would need to find a door that would take ProtagonistA there . ProtagonistA thanked the person and began to look for the door . ProtagonistA did n't know where it was , but ProtagonistA was determined to find it . ProtagonistA searched for hours , but ProtagonistA could n't find it . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw a door in the distance . It was the door to ProtagonistB . 
When ProtagonistA was seven and ProtagonistA had nothing to do , ProtagonistA sat down on the floor of ProtagonistA's father 's bedroom and read a book , with a book in the lap of ProtagonistA's hand , holding the pages up against the light , and the light has never been the same again . From that day on , ProtagonistA was a different person . ProtagonistA was always reading , and ProtagonistA loved it . It was ProtagonistA's escape from the reality of ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA cherished it . 
The sun was up on this day ; the moon was bright and ProtagonistA sprang out of ProtagonistA's perch with a great voice .  It 's time to wake up , sleepyhead !  ProtagonistA called out to the world .  There 's so much to do and see today !  ProtagonistA was always full of energy and enthusiasm , and today was no different . ProtagonistA bounded around the forest , greeting all of ProtagonistA's animal friends along the way .  Come on , everyone !  ProtagonistA called out .  Let 's go explore !  
ProtagonistA was sitting on the veranda of the front door with ProtagonistA's hands on the knob , when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the other side of the door . ProtagonistA slowly turned the knob and opened the door a crack , to see what was making the noise . Peeking through the opening , ProtagonistA saw a small , furry creature scurrying around the floor . It was a mouse ! ProtagonistA had always been afraid of mice , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't just leave it there to starve . ProtagonistA slowly opened the door wider and reached out ProtagonistA's hand to the mouse . It hesitated for a moment , but then ran towards ProtagonistA and climbed up ProtagonistA's arm . Once it was safely in ProtagonistA's hand , ProtagonistA carried it outside and released it into the grass . 
Figa , of a family of only two children , having fallen sick , with an acute hope of death , accompanied by great apprehensions , while ProtagonistA was awaiting the publication of ProtagonistA's work , which was entitled A History of the World , ProtagonistA determined to devote to the study of it all that was worthy of ProtagonistA's mind and to the satisfaction of the human race . In this manner ProtagonistA would not only be able to continue ProtagonistA's work after death , but also to be of some service to the living . 
ProtagonistA sulks and sinks back into the bible , ProtagonistA's silver eyes fixed on a section regarding birds . ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by birds , even before ProtagonistA could read . ProtagonistA would spend hours watching them , trying to understand their movements and their songs . But now , ProtagonistA just felt angry . Angry at the birds , for being so free . Angry at ProtagonistA , for being so trapped . ProtagonistA had always known ProtagonistA was different , but ProtagonistA had never realized how much until now . ProtagonistA felt like a caged bird ProtagonistA , and the thought made ProtagonistA even more angry . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice . It was soft and gentle , and it seemed to be coming from the page ProtagonistA was looking at .  ProtagonistA ,  the voice said ,  ProtagonistA are not alone . We are all here with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA looked up , and saw a flock of birds flying overhead . They were all different kinds , but they were all singing the same song . And as ProtagonistA listened , ProtagonistA realized that they were singing to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's anger melting away , and ProtagonistA smiled . Maybe ProtagonistA was n't so alone after all . 
ProtagonistA sits cross - legged on the floor of the dark alcove , ProtagonistA's fingers tracing the lines of a small painting . The painting is of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB's hair cascading down ProtagonistB's back in a waterfall of curls . ProtagonistB's eyes are closed , ProtagonistB's face turned up to the sky . ProtagonistA feels a sense of peace emanating from the painting , and ProtagonistA ca n't help but feel drawn to it . ProtagonistA sits there for a long time , just staring at the painting and letting ProtagonistA's mind wander . 
I see ProtagonistA's Rolls - Royce parked beside my school , said ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA's fancy - picture - tiles on the mantelpiece , and ProtagonistA's clapboard in the corner . ProtagonistB was a successful businessman , and ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's only child . ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA could ever want , but ProtagonistA was still unhappy . ProtagonistA was always getting into trouble at school , and ProtagonistB had to bail ProtagonistA out . ProtagonistA was constantly partying and drinking , and ProtagonistB was worried about ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistB had had enough . ProtagonistB sat ProtagonistA down and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to shape up or ProtagonistB was going to cut ProtagonistA off . ProtagonistA did n't listen . ProtagonistA partyied even more and ProtagonistA's grades suffered . Eventually , ProtagonistB had had enough and ProtagonistB did cut ProtagonistA off . ProtagonistA was left with nothing . ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA had made a mistake . ProtagonistA tried to get ProtagonistB to take ProtagonistA back , but ProtagonistB refused . ProtagonistA was forced to get a job and support ProtagonistA . It was a hard lesson to learn , but ProtagonistA eventually did . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA did n't need ProtagonistB's money to be happy . 
ProtagonistA had been with the ship for years , and it had been ProtagonistA's home . ProtagonistA was partial drowned when ProtagonistA climbed into the water to get away from a fire that had broken out on board . When ProtagonistA was rescued , ProtagonistA was taken to the hospital and treated for ProtagonistA's injuries . ProtagonistA was released from the hospital a few days later and returned to the ship . 
ProtagonistA was on the eve of the most important visit of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was to meet the family of the Earl 's son who was coming to Arrakis from the Province . ProtagonistA was very excited and nervous at the same time . ProtagonistA wanted everything to be perfect . ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's best dress laid out and ProtagonistA's hair done up in an elegant style . ProtagonistA was just about to go to bed when ProtagonistA heard a noise outside ProtagonistA's window . ProtagonistA got up to investigate and saw a large , black bird perched on ProtagonistA's window sill . The bird looked at ProtagonistA with its bright , orange eyes and then flew away . ProtagonistA was so startled that ProtagonistA dropped ProtagonistA's lamp and it shattered on the floor . ProtagonistA quickly went to bed , but ProtagonistA could not shake the feeling that the bird was an omen of something bad to come . 
ProtagonistA's facial features , ProtagonistA's eye color , and ProtagonistA's body , said ProtagonistB , are all different . ProtagonistB was always pointing out how ProtagonistA was different from the rest of us , and it was n't just ProtagonistA's looks . ProtagonistA was always doing things differently . ProtagonistA would walk to school a different way every day , and ProtagonistA would always find new and interesting things to do . One time , ProtagonistA even found a four - leaf clover ! ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA was special , and that we should all learn from ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had been fighting for ProtagonistA's life for what felt like hours . ProtagonistB was a skilled swordsman , and ProtagonistA was quickly tiring . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't keep this up much longer . Suddenly , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's opportunity . ProtagonistB's sword arm was getting tired , and ProtagonistB's guard was slipping . ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's chance and lunged forward , disarming ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB's sword went flying off the edge of the platform they were fighting on , and ProtagonistB stumbled backwards , clutching at ProtagonistB's chest . ProtagonistA went to move forward and finish ProtagonistB off , but ProtagonistA's foot caught on something and ProtagonistA stumbled . ProtagonistA's cloak flew up into the air and wrapped around ProtagonistB's body , preventing ProtagonistB from falling off the edge . ProtagonistA quickly regained ProtagonistA's footing and ran to ProtagonistB , pulling ProtagonistB back from the edge . ProtagonistA helped ProtagonistB to ProtagonistB's feet and handed ProtagonistB ProtagonistB's sword .  ProtagonistA fight well ,  ProtagonistB said .  But ProtagonistA 're not the only one with tricks up their sleeve .  With that , ProtagonistB turned and ran back the way they had come , disappearing into the darkness . 
ProtagonistA had been thinking all night and ProtagonistA 'd been stumped ever since . ProtagonistA had been trying to think of a way to tell ProtagonistB , that ProtagonistA liked ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB liked ProtagonistA too , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistB liked ProtagonistA in the same way . ProtagonistA did n't want to ruin their friendship if ProtagonistB did n't feel the same way . ProtagonistA finally decided that ProtagonistA would just have to tell ProtagonistB and see what happened . ProtagonistA gathered ProtagonistA's courage and approached ProtagonistB the next day . ProtagonistB's face lit up when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had made the right decision . 
ProtagonistA had driven for an entire day , and a whole day 's sleep , and had done nothing of note save to be driven to the place ProtagonistA was going to be raped . ProtagonistA had been planning to stop at a motel for the night , but ProtagonistB had told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA would not be needing a room . When ProtagonistA asked where they were going , ProtagonistB simply told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would see when they got there . ProtagonistA was terrified . ProtagonistA had no idea what was going to happen to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA knew it could n't be good . ProtagonistA had been planning to fight back , but ProtagonistA was so tired from the drive that ProtagonistA could n't muster the energy . When they arrived at their destination , ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA into a dark room . ProtagonistA could hear someone else in the room , but ProtagonistA could n't see them . Then , ProtagonistA felt a cold , hard object press against ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA knew what was coming next , and ProtagonistA resigned ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's fate . 
ProtagonistA had been very wrong in ProtagonistA's belief that I would ever be with anyone , or marry anyone . ProtagonistA had seen me with many women over the years , but ProtagonistA always assumed that I was just playing the field and that I would eventually settle down with one woman . ProtagonistA was wrong . I met ProtagonistB and I married ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was happy for me , but ProtagonistA also could n't help but feel a little bit jealous . ProtagonistA had always wanted to be with me , but ProtagonistA knew that it was never meant to be . 
ProtagonistA was sitting at ProtagonistA's typewriter , studying the words typed on the screen . ProtagonistA was trying to decide if ProtagonistA should change them or not . ProtagonistA was thinking about how ProtagonistA's story was going to end . ProtagonistA had a few ideas , but ProtagonistA was n't sure which one to choose . ProtagonistA was also thinking about the other stories ProtagonistA had written . ProtagonistA was wondering if ProtagonistA should change them too . ProtagonistA was thinking about all of this when ProtagonistA heard a noise . It sounded like someone was coming up the stairs . ProtagonistA got up from ProtagonistA's chair and went to the door . ProtagonistA looked through the peephole and saw ProtagonistB walking up the stairs . ProtagonistB was carrying a large bag . ProtagonistA quickly went back to ProtagonistA's typewriter and sat down . ProtagonistA did n't want ProtagonistB to know ProtagonistA was there . ProtagonistA was trying to think of a way to get out of the situation . ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB coming closer to ProtagonistA's door . ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB stop at ProtagonistA's door . ProtagonistA held ProtagonistA's breath . ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB put the bag down . ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB fumbling with something . ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB curse . ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB walk away . ProtagonistA waited a few minutes before ProtagonistA got up . ProtagonistA looked out the peephole again . ProtagonistB was gone . ProtagonistA opened the door and looked around . ProtagonistA did n't see ProtagonistB or the bag . ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistA's typewriter and sat down . ProtagonistA was relieved that ProtagonistB was gone . ProtagonistA was also curious about what was in the bag . ProtagonistA decided to go and find out . 
ProtagonistA was out for a walk in the park when ProtagonistA came across a bush . On the bush was a turnip , and on the turnip was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had never seen ProtagonistB before , but ProtagonistA was n't sure . ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA and said ,  Hello . ProtagonistB's name is Timmy . What 's ProtagonistA's name ?  ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's name , and the two of them talked for a while . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life and how ProtagonistB came to be on the turnip . ProtagonistA was fascinated by ProtagonistB's story and found ProtagonistA liking ProtagonistB . Eventually , ProtagonistA had to go , but ProtagonistA promised to come back and visit ProtagonistB again . 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the shadow of the building , and ProtagonistA's eyes had the kind of serenity of a few hours spent in a convincing dream . It was early morning , and the sun was just starting to peek over the horizon . The birds were chirping and the breeze was blowing . ProtagonistA felt at peace . ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately and needed a moment to just relax and breathe . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let the peace wash over ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA had a habit of making a speech with all the amazing clarity , propriety , and rationalism of a genius , and almost the same effect , when ProtagonistA had finished , as when ProtagonistA had finished ; for ProtagonistA was always going on about something , ever since ProtagonistA had heard it described to ProtagonistA . This made ProtagonistA quite popular with the other girls , who would often ask ProtagonistA to make a speech at their parties . However , ProtagonistA was never quite sure what to say , and ProtagonistA would often end up rambling on about something that nobody else cared about . 
ProtagonistA has always considered ProtagonistA a strong and independent woman . ProtagonistA 's never been one for traditional gender roles and has always been determined to forge ProtagonistA's own path in life . So , when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was immediately drawn to ProtagonistB's free - spirited nature and independent streak . They were married within a year and ProtagonistA could n't have been happier . However , ProtagonistA soon realized that being married was n't quite as freeing as ProtagonistA had thought it would be . Yes , ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB deeply and they had a great relationship , but ProtagonistA also felt like ProtagonistA now had a responsibility to ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA did n't have before . ProtagonistA became more aware of ProtagonistA's need to take care of ProtagonistB and make sure that ProtagonistB was happy and healthy . In some ways , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was losing ProtagonistA's independence by being married . But , at the same time , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was gaining something much more valuable : a true partner in life who loved and supported ProtagonistA unconditionally . And , ProtagonistA realized , that was worth more than anything . 
They were sitting together on the leaden plank of the old boat , the aye , but not so long ago when the sailors were shivering in their hundreds , when the water was so deep that even the redskin boys were drowned in it ; when the sun was so low and the sky so black that the fires of the desert were almost out of breath , when the ship was so light that ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head in despair when ProtagonistA saw the captain in the middle of the night going beyond the windward deck , and instead of sinking , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA among the stars , drifting in space , with the power to move anything that ProtagonistA pleased in the universe . 
ProtagonistA has never been to the movies before , but ProtagonistA 's always been involved in them . As a child , ProtagonistA would often act out scenes from ProtagonistA's favorite films with ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA would always be the one to direct and produce these little productions . Even though ProtagonistA 's never actually been to a movie theater , ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA knows them quite well .

ProtagonistA ran with alacrity through several miles of fields , forests , and meadows , bearing with ProtagonistA the great stuff of life : the apple , the bramble , the cherry - tree , the thorn - trees , and so many trees , some two hundred yards in circumference . ProtagonistA had been running for hours , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and ProtagonistA's breath was coming in ragged gasps . But ProtagonistA did n't stop , ProtagonistA could n't stop .

ProtagonistA 's seen some things in ProtagonistA's time , some things that would make even the most hardened criminal cringe , but ProtagonistA 's never let it get to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 's always been the one to keep ProtagonistA's head in a crisis , and that 's why ProtagonistA 's the best . But lately , something 's been bothering ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA ca n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but ProtagonistA feels like something 's not right . ProtagonistA 's been seeing things out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye , things that disappear when ProtagonistA turns to look at them . ProtagonistA 's heard strange noises in the night , and ProtagonistA 's sure that ProtagonistA 's being followed . ProtagonistA 's tried to tell ProtagonistA's superiors about ProtagonistA's concerns , but they just brush ProtagonistA off . They tell ProtagonistA ProtagonistA 's imagining things , that ProtagonistA 's just working too hard . But ProtagonistA knows better . ProtagonistA knows that something is wrong , and ProtagonistA 's determined to find out what it is . ProtagonistA starts doing some digging , and ProtagonistA quickly discovers that there 's a new drug on the streets of London . It 's called  the stuff ,  and it 's said to be incredibly powerful . People who take it are said to see things that are n't really there , and ProtagonistA is sure that 's what 's happening to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA starts tracking down the dealers who are selling the stuff , and ProtagonistA finally manages to put an end to it . ProtagonistA 's saved countless lives by taking this drug off the streets , and ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA 's made a difference . But ProtagonistA ca n't help but feel a little uneasy . ProtagonistA 's sure that there 's something else out there , something even more dangerous . And ProtagonistA 's determined to find it . 
ProtagonistA was always a tall girl , even when ProtagonistA was just six years old . ProtagonistA towers over ProtagonistA's classmates and everyone always comments on how pretty ProtagonistA is . But ProtagonistA never really felt like ProtagonistA fit in . ProtagonistA was always the tallest , the prettiest , and the smartest girl in ProtagonistA's class , but ProtagonistA never felt like ProtagonistA belonged . One day , ProtagonistA ran into ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB , told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was also born a tall , pretty girl . But unlike ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB had never felt like ProtagonistB belonged either . The two girls became fast friends and promised to always stick together . Now , whenever ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA does n't belong , ProtagonistA thinks of ProtagonistB and knows that ProtagonistA 's not alone . 
ProtagonistA was walking through town on the left hand side of the road when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . It was the strangest thing ProtagonistA had ever seen . ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB's story was . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was born with a condition that made ProtagonistB look like a boy , but ProtagonistB was really a girl . ProtagonistB said that it was hard for ProtagonistB to find love and acceptance because of the way ProtagonistB looked . But ProtagonistB was happy with who ProtagonistB was . ProtagonistA was so moved by ProtagonistB's story that ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB a hug . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB was beautiful and that ProtagonistB deserved to be loved . 
There was once ProtagonistA . They had been together for two years and were planning on getting married in the summer . Everything was perfect until ProtagonistB was diagnosed with cancer . The doctors said that ProtagonistB only had a few months to live . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to go on without ProtagonistB . They had been planning their future together and now it was all being taken away from ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was so lost and confused . One day , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's grave and ProtagonistA just sat there and cried . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had no one to turn to . Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt a hand on ProtagonistA's shoulder and ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistB standing there . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was sorry for everything and that ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA . Then ProtagonistB said goodbye and walked away . ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA could n't believe that ProtagonistA had just seen ProtagonistB . It was like a miracle . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistB had given ProtagonistA the strength to go on . Even though ProtagonistB was gone , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would always be with ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was beyond exhausted . ProtagonistA had been walking for days , it felt like , in search of a safe place to rest . ProtagonistA had been on the run from the zombies ever since the outbreak had begun . ProtagonistA had seen too many people ProtagonistA loved die - first ProtagonistA's parents , then ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA was all alone now , and ProtagonistA was running out of hope . ProtagonistA had been sleeping in abandoned buildings and cars when ProtagonistA could , but it was never safe for long . ProtagonistA was always on the move , always looking for a place to hide . But now , ProtagonistA's luck had run out . ProtagonistA had been caught by a group of zombies . ProtagonistA had fought them off as best ProtagonistA could , but in the end , they had overpowered ProtagonistA . And now , here ProtagonistA was , in an old , abandoned cell . ProtagonistA was battered and bruised , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was n't going to make it out alive . ProtagonistA lay down on the cold , hard floor , and ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes . Sleeping is a bitch ,  ProtagonistA said to ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA prepared to die . 
And then there was ProtagonistA , and it was as if ProtagonistA had been born with a soul , and it was as if ProtagonistA had been born to be a dead man , and it was as though ProtagonistA had been born in the middle of the desert , and it was as though ProtagonistA had been born in the dead of winter , and it was as though ProtagonistA had been born in a small town , and as though ProtagonistA had been born in a small , crowded town , and it had been only twelve here , and there was a full moon , and it had been fenced off and a total of sixty - four people , and no one knew , and nobody was quite sure what the password was , and it did not make any difference , because nobody had ever had the misfortune of knowing what the password was , and nobody had ever going to be a million times as smart as ProtagonistA was , and nobody was n't quite sure how they got into the place , and nobody was quite sure how they started , and nobody had ever known , and nobody had ever really known , and theory was as cold as theory , and theory was what had , as far as anybody was concerned , taken the place of practice ; and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and . 
ProtagonistA was sitting at the table with ProtagonistA's family on the first day of the summer solstice . They were all enjoying the warm weather and the longer days . ProtagonistB started to tell a story about a time when ProtagonistB was a young boy . ProtagonistB said that on the first day of the summer solstice , in the most northeasterly part of the state of Maine , in the summer of 1763 , ProtagonistB had happened to be sitting at the same table as the conversation below took place .  ProtagonistB was sitting at the table with ProtagonistB's family on the first day of the summer solstice ,  ProtagonistB began .  It was a beautiful day and we were all enjoying the warm weather . Suddenly , a man came running into the village , shouting that the British were coming . We all ran to the fort to defend our homes . The British arrived and started to attack the fort . We fought back as best we could , but we were outnumbered and outgunned . After a few hours , the British started to retreat . We were all relieved and happy to be alive . We had won the battle , but it was a close call . ProtagonistB finished ProtagonistB's story and everyone at the table was silent . They were all thinking about the brave men and women who had fought and died to defend their homes . ProtagonistB had been one of the lucky ones . ProtagonistB had survived the battle , but many others had not . The summer solstice was a day to remember the past and to celebrate the present . 
ProtagonistA had been walking ProtagonistB , every day for years . It was one of the things ProtagonistA looked forward to most . Even in ProtagonistA's seventies , ProtagonistA was still able to take ProtagonistB for a walk around the block . One day , as they were walking , ProtagonistA saw a cat in a tree . ProtagonistA had never seen that cat before . It was a beautiful black cat with green eyes . ProtagonistA stopped to look at it . The cat looked at ProtagonistA and meowed . It sounded like it was asking for help . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA did n't want to leave the cat there , but ProtagonistA did n't want to leave ProtagonistB alone either . Finally , ProtagonistA made a decision . ProtagonistA would go get help . ProtagonistA would find someone to help ProtagonistA get the cat down from the tree . ProtagonistA walked home , ProtagonistB by ProtagonistA's side . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had made the right decision . 
ProtagonistA was a woman who lived a simple life . ProtagonistA worked hard at ProtagonistA's job and came home to relax in ProtagonistA's small apartment . ProtagonistA's favorite pastime was watching television , and ProtagonistA would often spend hours glued to the screen . One day , ProtagonistA's family came to visit ProtagonistA . They had been worried about ProtagonistA since ProtagonistA had become more withdrawn and isolated in recent years . When they arrived at ProtagonistA's apartment , they found ProtagonistA in a little room on the second floor , laying with ProtagonistA's eyes fixed upon a television screen . ProtagonistA's hands were resting upon the table , and ProtagonistA seemed to be in a trance - like state . ProtagonistA's family tried to talk to ProtagonistA and get ProtagonistA to respond , but it was as if ProtagonistA could n't hear them . They eventually had to leave ProtagonistA there , alone in ProtagonistA's little room , staring at the television . 
The night before ProtagonistA drowned , ProtagonistA had a dream , as it were . In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA standing at the edge of a vast and dark ocean . ProtagonistA could not see the shoreline in either direction , and the only sound was the crashing of the waves . In the dream , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to drown , and ProtagonistA felt a deep sense of terror . But even as ProtagonistA felt the fear , ProtagonistA also felt a sense of peace and acceptance . In the dream , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA diving into the water and sinking down into the darkness . ProtagonistA could feel the water closing in around ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to die . But even as ProtagonistA felt the fear , ProtagonistA also felt a sense of peace and acceptance . 
ProtagonistA had not changed one bit since the day ProtagonistA had to flee ProtagonistA's homeland . ProtagonistA was still the same strong , independent woman ProtagonistA had always been . ProtagonistA had never been one to rely on others , and ProtagonistA was determined to make it on ProtagonistA's own . When ProtagonistA arrived in the United States , ProtagonistA had nothing but the clothes on ProtagonistA's back and the determination to succeed . ProtagonistA started out working odd jobs , but eventually ProtagonistA was able to get a job in a factory . ProtagonistA worked hard and saved ProtagonistA's money , and eventually ProtagonistA was able to buy ProtagonistA's own home . ProtagonistA was proud of ProtagonistA's accomplishments , and ProtagonistA was determined to help others who were in ProtagonistA's situation . ProtagonistA became a mentor to other refugees , and ProtagonistA helped them adjust to their new lives . ProtagonistA was a symbol of hope for many people , and ProtagonistA was proud to be able to help others . 
ProtagonistA called she by ProtagonistA's surname , and we have been called by it ever since . It was a cold winter morning and ProtagonistA had just awoken from a long sleep . ProtagonistA slowly got out of bed , feeling a bit disoriented . As ProtagonistA began to make ProtagonistA's way downstairs , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name . It sounded like ProtagonistA's mother .  ProtagonistA , breakfast is ready !  However , when ProtagonistA got to the kitchen , ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistA's mother was not there . Instead , ProtagonistA saw a large rabbit sitting at the table . The rabbit was wearing a waistcoat and a pocket watch .  ProtagonistA , I 'm late , late , late !  The rabbit said in a frantic voice .  Follow me !  ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA decided to follow the rabbit . ProtagonistA had never seen anything like this before , and ProtagonistA was curious to see where the rabbit would lead ProtagonistA . The rabbit led ProtagonistA to a large door .  Through here , ProtagonistA !  The rabbit said . ProtagonistA walked through the door and found ProtagonistA in a very strange place . The first thing ProtagonistA noticed was the giant mushrooms . Then ProtagonistA saw the talking flowers . ProtagonistA even saw a butterfly with a human face . ProtagonistA was so surprised by all of this that ProtagonistA forgot to be scared . The rabbit led ProtagonistA to a small house .  This is my home ,  the rabbit said .  ProtagonistA can stay here for a while if ProtagonistA like .  ProtagonistA was so grateful to the rabbit that ProtagonistA decided to stay . ProtagonistA had never seen anything like this place before , and ProtagonistA wanted to explore it more . 
ProtagonistA had been living in ProtagonistA's house for years , and it was going well enough . But when ProtagonistA would begin the long , slow process of relocating from one place to another , the Living would always find a way to beat ProtagonistA to it . They would show up at ProtagonistA's new house before ProtagonistA could even get there , and they would always be one step ahead of ProtagonistA . It was as if they knew ProtagonistA every move . One day , ProtagonistA decided enough was enough . ProtagonistA was going to move out of ProtagonistA's house and into a new one , and ProtagonistA was going to do it without the Living knowing . ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things in the middle of the night and left ProtagonistA's house quietly . ProtagonistA drove to ProtagonistA's new house , and when ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA saw that the Living were there , waiting for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was furious . ProtagonistA had outsmarted them this time , but ProtagonistA knew they would be back . ProtagonistA had to find a way to get rid of them for good . 
ProtagonistA descended the aisle of the château of the Riveuilles ; an imposing house of splendour and distinction , from which ProtagonistA received the name of Richelieu , or Richelodio , or , perhaps , of Lord Bertram . It was a name that held much power and influence in the court of King Louis XIV . As ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way down the aisle , ProtagonistA could feel the weight of the name bearing down on ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistA held ProtagonistA's head high and continued on . ProtagonistA had always been a headstrong girl . ProtagonistA was never one to follow the rules or do what was expected of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA much preferred to forge ProtagonistA's own path . And that was how ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA at the château of the Riveuilles . ProtagonistA had heard rumours of the wild parties that took place there and ProtagonistA was determined to see for ProtagonistA . As ProtagonistA descended the aisle , ProtagonistA could feel the eyes of the guests on ProtagonistA . They were all wondering who ProtagonistA was and why ProtagonistA was there . But ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA was there to have fun and that was all that mattered . The party was in full swing by the time ProtagonistA arrived . ProtagonistA was soon swept up in the festivities . The music was loud , the champagne was flowing , and everyone was dancing . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA belonged there . As the night went on , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA drawn to ProtagonistB . They danced together and laughed together and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream . ProtagonistA did n't want the night to end . But all good things must come to an end . Eventually , the party started to wind down and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA saying goodbye to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA did n't know ProtagonistB's name , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB . As ProtagonistA walked back up the aisle , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was floating on air . ProtagonistA had found what ProtagonistA was looking for at the château of the Riveuilles . ProtagonistA had found a place where ProtagonistA could be ProtagonistA and have fun . And ProtagonistA would never forget the night ProtagonistA spent there . 
ProtagonistA was unaccustomed to the sight of ProtagonistA's brother 's statue with ProtagonistA's father atop the Westminster tower . ProtagonistA felt dismayed and intellectually disgraced at what ProtagonistA saw . However , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to face the music and deal with the situation . After all , it was the Saturday before the fourth Sunday in May. 
ProtagonistA woke early , and ProtagonistA woke often , as if ProtagonistA had been awake forever , until it was too late . The sun was already high in the sky by the time ProtagonistA finally opened ProtagonistA's eyes , and ProtagonistA cursed ProtagonistA for sleeping in so late . ProtagonistA had wanted to get an early start on the day , but now it was already half over . ProtagonistA got out of bed and quickly got dressed , then headed downstairs . ProtagonistB was in the kitchen , and ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a stern look .  ProtagonistA 're up late ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA should have been up hours ago . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was right , but ProtagonistA did n't want to admit it .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'll do better tomorrow . ProtagonistB sighed .  ProtagonistB hope so ,  ProtagonistB said .  Now go outside and play . It 's a beautiful day . ProtagonistA went outside , but ProtagonistA did n't feel like playing . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had wasted the day , and ProtagonistA was angry at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA sat down on the porch and watched the birds in the trees , but ProtagonistA did n't feel any better . Eventually , ProtagonistA went back inside and up to ProtagonistA's room . ProtagonistA lay down on ProtagonistA's bed and stared at the ceiling , wondering what ProtagonistA was going to do with the rest of ProtagonistA's life . 
ProtagonistA has finished ProtagonistA's work and is ready to go now . ProtagonistA hears the voice even now , telling ProtagonistA to hurry up . ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA ca n't keep the voice waiting any longer . ProtagonistA has to go now . 
ProtagonistA had chosen the kingdom of ProtagonistB out of all creation ; and the power of ProtagonistC had shone forth in every way , to please ProtagonistA . The beauty of the Heavenly City had astounded ProtagonistA , and the streets were lined with the most perfect of pearls . ProtagonistA had walked with the angels , and they had showed ProtagonistA the wonders of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistC had been so pleased with ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC had given ProtagonistA a gift ; a golden crown , set with diamonds and rubies . 
The night before ProtagonistA drowned , ProtagonistA dreamt that ProtagonistA was walking along a path by a river . The river was swollen and fast - flowing , and ProtagonistA could see that the path ahead was washed away . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should turn back , but ProtagonistA felt compelled to keep walking . Suddenly , the ground gave way beneath ProtagonistA's feet and ProtagonistA was pulled into the river . ProtagonistA struggled to swim to the surface , but the current was too strong . ProtagonistA could see the shore getting further and further away as ProtagonistA was pulled downstream . ProtagonistA fought against the current , but eventually ProtagonistA tired and ProtagonistA's body went limp . ProtagonistA sank beneath the surface and drowned . When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get out of the house before it was too late . 
ProtagonistA walked the streets of Croydon , and felt as if ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's heart in ProtagonistA's hands . ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had received the news that ProtagonistA's boyfriend had been cheating on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had nowhere to go and no one to turn to . The only thing ProtagonistA could think to do was to walk and clear ProtagonistA's head . As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA passed by a group of girls ProtagonistA's own age . They were laughing and joking and seemed to be having the time of their lives . ProtagonistA could n't help but feel envious of them . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could be carefree like them , but ProtagonistA just could n't . ProtagonistA felt as if ProtagonistA's heart had been shattered into a million pieces , and ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA would ever be able to put it back together again . 
ProtagonistA , with Sarah , the little princess , at ProtagonistA's side , rode out into the great wide plain of Phlegethon , where ProtagonistA found the rest of ProtagonistA's family in the company of Mrs. Elizabeth , the wife of Mr. Eliopolo , the Colonel of the Household at Court , and with whom ProtagonistA was always merry , and who was the cause of much expense to Carol 's owing to the imprudence of ProtagonistA , for ProtagonistA had never thought of it before . They all greeted ProtagonistA with great joy , and ProtagonistA was soon seated at the table , where ProtagonistA found that a sumptuous repast had been prepared for ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA stood on the horizon of the world , a proud and proud man , but one who knew ProtagonistA had nothing to fear but might actually have some advantage over a very large and very dangerous enemy . ProtagonistA had been planning and preparing for this day for years , and now , finally , ProtagonistA was ready . ProtagonistA was armed with the knowledge of ProtagonistA's enemies ' weaknesses , and ProtagonistA was confident in ProtagonistA's own abilities . ProtagonistA was going to win this fight , and ProtagonistA was going to make ProtagonistA's enemies pay . 
In the year 1251 ProtagonistA loomed over London , and what was the matter with ProtagonistA ? No one could say for sure , but some speculated that ProtagonistA was a giantess come to destroy the city . Others said that ProtagonistA was a benevolent spirit come to protect them from harm . Whatever the case may have been , everyone was afraid of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB ordered ProtagonistB's best knights to go and investigate ProtagonistA , but they were all afraid to approach ProtagonistA . Finally , ProtagonistB went to speak with ProtagonistA . When ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA's purpose was , ProtagonistA simply replied that ProtagonistA was there to protect the city . ProtagonistA said that a great danger was coming and that ProtagonistA would do everything in ProtagonistA's power to stop it . ProtagonistB was so grateful to ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB ordered a statue to be built in ProtagonistA's honor . It stands to this day in the center of London , a reminder of ProtagonistA . 
It was whispered in the city that ProtagonistA knew how it came to pass . ProtagonistA stammered when ProtagonistA told the story , but everyone knew ProtagonistA was telling the truth . ProtagonistA had seen it with ProtagonistA's own eyes . ProtagonistA was the only one who saw what happened that fateful night . 
There was once ProtagonistA ; but ProtagonistA was also a man who enjoyed the art of murdering . ProtagonistA was a beautiful woman , with long dark hair and piercing blue eyes . But ProtagonistA was also a cold - blooded killer , who took pleasure in torturing and murdering ProtagonistA's victims . ProtagonistA's victims were always men , and ProtagonistA always made sure to torture them before killing them . ProtagonistA enjoyed hearing them scream in pain , and seeing the terror in their eyes . 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's chamber at Lambeth , when ProtagonistA received an urgent and threatening communication . The servant of the lord Bishop of York , who had been appointed by the king to receive the precepts of the church , had been instructed to deliver it to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA took the message very seriously and immediately began to make preparations to leave . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would not be safe if ProtagonistA stayed at Lambeth , and so ProtagonistA set out into the stormy night . ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to get away from the Bishop 's servant . ProtagonistA walked through the stormy night , until ProtagonistA came to a small cottage . ProtagonistA knocked on the door and was welcomed inside by the kindly old woman who lived there . ProtagonistA stayed with the old woman for the rest of the night , and in the morning , ProtagonistA set out again on ProtagonistA's journey . ProtagonistA never looked back , and ProtagonistA never forgot the stormy night when ProtagonistA had to flee from the Bishop 's servant . 
After the war ended , a little more than a year earlier , we settled in a house in the district of St. Peter 's , in which ProtagonistA had done the best ProtagonistA could . It was a small house , but it was cozy and we were happy there . We had been through so much together , and now we were finally able to start our lives anew . ProtagonistA had been through a lot during the war . ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's husband and ProtagonistA's son , and ProtagonistA had been forced to flee ProtagonistA's home . But ProtagonistA was a strong woman , and ProtagonistA had managed to make it through . Now , ProtagonistA was determined to make a new life for ProtagonistA and for us . We settled into our new life quickly . ProtagonistA got a job at the local grocery store , and I started school . We were both busy , but we were happy . We had each other , and that was all that mattered . Life was good for a while . But then , ProtagonistA started to get sick . At first , we thought it was just a cold , but it quickly became clear that it was something more serious . ProtagonistA was diagnosed with cancer , and our world was turned upside down . We fought hard , but in the end , ProtagonistA lost ProtagonistA's battle . I was heartbroken , but I knew that ProtagonistA was at peace . ProtagonistA had given everything ProtagonistA had to make our lives better , and I would never forget ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's chair on the left , reading a letter ; but the letter was full of facts that were interesting to ProtagonistA , such as , ProtagonistA's uncle was a man of coarse manners , and , in consequence of the poverty of his household , very few persons in its neighbourhood were wealthy , and in whom ProtagonistA had any feeling of sympathy . 
ProtagonistA sat in the sun and ProtagonistA's mind busy . ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how ProtagonistA got to where ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's family and friends and how they had all helped ProtagonistA along the way . ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's career and how ProtagonistA had worked hard to get where ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's future and what ProtagonistA wanted to do with ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was thinking about all of these things when ProtagonistA heard a voice .  ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA okay ?  The voice belonged to ProtagonistA's friend , Concerned .  ProtagonistA 'm fine ,  ProtagonistA replied .  ProtagonistA was just thinking about ProtagonistA's life .  
ProtagonistA can remember the last time ProtagonistA had sex like it was yesterday . ProtagonistA was with ProtagonistA's boyfriend at the time , and they were both really enjoying themselves . Unfortunately , all good things must come to an end , and ProtagonistA's boyfriend died shortly after they finished . Since then , ProtagonistA has been celibate , and ProtagonistA does n't regret it one bit . ProtagonistA knows that all men , of whatever sex , must die , but ProtagonistA 's happy to have those memories of ProtagonistA's last time with ProtagonistA's boyfriend . 
ProtagonistA was the most famous and adored character in the world . ProtagonistA was called the Angel of Death because ProtagonistA had the audacity to become the Victim of a horrible and terrible crime . The crime was the least of all crimes , but it was still a crime . ProtagonistA was a beautiful young woman with a heart of gold . ProtagonistA was always helping others and ProtagonistA was loved by everyone . One day , ProtagonistA was walking home from work when ProtagonistA was attacked by a man who stabbed ProtagonistA to death . The man was never caught and ProtagonistA's death left the world in shock . 
ProtagonistA was a young woman from a small town who had always dreamed of visiting the nation 's capital . One day , ProtagonistA finally made the trip and was determined to see as much as ProtagonistA could . ProtagonistA started with a tour of the Capitol building and was amazed by the size and grandeur of the place . However , ProtagonistA quickly became disappointed when ProtagonistA saw the condition of the grounds . The grass was overgrown , the walkways were cracked and uneven , and the whole place looked like it had been neglected . ProtagonistA was so appalled by the state of the Capitol that ProtagonistA refused to leave until ProtagonistA had spoken to someone in charge . ProtagonistA demanded to know why the grounds were in such a state of disrepair and was told that the budget for maintenance had been cut . ProtagonistA was furious . ProtagonistA felt that it was a disgrace to the country that the Capitol was not being properly cared for . ProtagonistA vowed to write to ProtagonistA's congressman and demand that more money be allocated for the upkeep of the Capitol . 
ProtagonistA's office was always bustling with activity . Today was no different as a dozen men came in , all well - dressed and looking important . ProtagonistA knew why they were here - they were here to talk about the city 's improved condition and how it was affecting their businesses . ProtagonistA was a smart woman and ProtagonistA knew that these men were in a position to help ProtagonistA's business . ProtagonistA allowed them to talk , all the while thinking of ways to improve ProtagonistA's own business . After a while , ProtagonistA interrupted them and stated ProtagonistA's own opinion on the matter . The men were taken aback by ProtagonistA's forthrightness but they could see the wisdom in ProtagonistA's words . They agreed to help ProtagonistA and , before long , ProtagonistA's business was booming . ProtagonistA was able to help ProtagonistA's favourite ladies in their own businesses , and the city continued to improve . All thanks to the dozen men who came to ProtagonistA's office that day . 
You ca n't be the father of ProtagonistA . You just ca n't be . There 's no way . I mean , you and ProtagonistA's mother were never even together . You do n't even have the same last name . Plus , you 're black and ProtagonistA 's white . There 's just no way you could be the father of ProtagonistA . But here you are , standing in front of the judge , with the DNA test results in your hand , proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that you are in fact the father of ProtagonistA . The look on ProtagonistA's mother 's face is one of pure shock , and ProtagonistA is just staring at you with a mix of confusion and hurt in ProtagonistA's eyes . You ca n't help but feel guilty . You know that you should have told ProtagonistA the truth a long time ago , but you were afraid of how ProtagonistA would react . You were afraid of losing ProtagonistA . But now it 's too late .

All you can do is try to make things right from here on out . 
ProtagonistA stopped dead in ProtagonistA's tracks . ProtagonistA tried to find the source of the sound , but it just was n't there . ProtagonistA looked around , but there was nothing . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA heard it again . This time , ProtagonistA followed the sound until ProtagonistA found its source . It was a small , black cat . The cat was meowing and looked up at ProtagonistA with its big , green eyes . ProtagonistA felt sorry for the cat and decided to take it home . 
ProtagonistA was walking after dark when ProtagonistA saw a light in the distance . ProtagonistA walked towards it and never stopped . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA saw that the light was coming from a lamp on a porch . ProtagonistA walked up to the porch and saw ProtagonistB sitting in a rocking chair . ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA was lost . ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was n't lost , ProtagonistA was just walking . ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to come sit with ProtagonistB for a while . ProtagonistA sat in the rocking chair and they talked . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA . They talked until the sun came up . When it was time to go , ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a hug and told ProtagonistA to come back anytime . 
I have been listening to the last of the bishoprics and continuing to write to ProtagonistA , to inform ProtagonistA of my intention of moving to Canterbury - upon - Avon . I have been entranced by the beauty of the countryside and the peace that seems to pervade the air . I know that ProtagonistA will miss me , but I hope that ProtagonistA will understand my need for this change . I have already put my affairs in order and am ready to make the move . I only hope that ProtagonistA will be able to visit me often . 
ProtagonistA managed to keep ProtagonistA's head and face up , to enjoy the moment . ProtagonistA was determined not to let the other girls get the better of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had worked hard to be the best and ProtagonistA was going to enjoy ProtagonistA's moment of triumph . 
ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way to the grocery store when ProtagonistA saw a group of men sitting on the side of the road . ProtagonistA wondered if they had any leisure time to think about what they would do with the other men who were sitting around them . ProtagonistA had not seen many men on the road lately and thought it would be a good opportunity to get to know them . ProtagonistA walked over to the group and introduced ProtagonistA . They were all very friendly and told ProtagonistA about their lives . They told ProtagonistA about their families , their jobs , and their hobbies . ProtagonistA was very interested in their stories and enjoyed hearing about their lives . ProtagonistA was also very impressed with their knowledge of the world and their ability to have deep conversations . When ProtagonistA left , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had made some new friends and was looking forward to meeting them again . 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a dreamer . ProtagonistA loved to imagine what it would be like to have the life ProtagonistA always wanted . ProtagonistA would often daydream about what it would be like to be rich and famous , or to travel the world . However , there was one dream that ProtagonistA never dared to dream . It was the great dream , the thing ProtagonistA should never have taken the risk of doing . The wish , that great wish , that frightful wish , that terrible wish . That was something ProtagonistA never would have done , if ProtagonistA had not met ProtagonistB . And then ProtagonistA drank to the full . ProtagonistB's name was Tim , and ProtagonistB was always asking ProtagonistA questions about ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistB wanted to know everything about ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA telling ProtagonistB things ProtagonistA had never told anyone before . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's dreams , ProtagonistA's hopes , and ProtagonistA's fears . Eventually , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the great dream , the thing ProtagonistA should never have taken the risk of doing . The wish , that great wish , that frightful wish , that terrible wish . At first , ProtagonistB was shocked . ProtagonistB could n't believe that ProtagonistA would even consider doing something so risky . But then ProtagonistB started to think about it , and ProtagonistB realized that it was the perfect solution to all of ProtagonistA's problems . With ProtagonistB's help , ProtagonistA was able to make ProtagonistA's dream a reality . And it was everything ProtagonistA had ever hoped for . ProtagonistA was finally able to live the life ProtagonistA had always wanted . 
ProtagonistA was out for a walk near the frozen lake when ProtagonistA heard a loud cracking noise . ProtagonistA turned around to see the ice cracking open and a large hand reaching out towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA tried to run , but it was too late . The hand grabbed ProtagonistA and pulled ProtagonistA under the water . ProtagonistA could feel the icy cold water dragging ProtagonistA down , and the hand pulling at ProtagonistA's hair . ProtagonistA struggled to free ProtagonistA , but it was no use . ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistA losing consciousness and then everything went black . 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who lived in a small town . ProtagonistA was always curious about the world and loved to explore . One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole that led ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had many adventures in ProtagonistB and made many new friends . ProtagonistA even met a talking rabbit ! ProtagonistB was a very magical place and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who had a fear of abandonment . ProtagonistA had seen everything in the world , and ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistA knew what was best for ProtagonistA . However , ProtagonistA was always afraid that someone would leave ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had a love for the world , and ProtagonistA wanted to be a part of it , but ProtagonistA was always afraid that ProtagonistA would be left behind . 
ProtagonistA's eyes were aflame with curiosity as ProtagonistA listened to the news . ProtagonistA had always been interested in the world around ProtagonistA , and this was no exception . ProtagonistA was eager to learn more about what was happening in the world , and this was the perfect opportunity . 
One day , as ProtagonistA stood in the garden of ProtagonistA's father 's house , tracing the outlines of the structure ProtagonistA had built there on the foundations of the old stone house , the man who would become known as the Great Scribe of the Old Testament , or , as some people called ProtagonistA , the Habite Cretan , or simply the Lost Scribe , began to write . ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA for some time , and ProtagonistB was struck by the look of determination on ProtagonistA's face . It was clear that ProtagonistA was not going to give up on ProtagonistA's dream , no matter what . ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB to ProtagonistA and they began to talk . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's own life and how ProtagonistB had become the Great Scribe . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about the people ProtagonistB had met and the places ProtagonistB had seen . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about the things ProtagonistB had learned and the wisdom ProtagonistB had gained . ProtagonistA was fascinated by ProtagonistB's stories and ProtagonistA hung on ProtagonistB's every word . ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was a man who had lived a full and interesting life , and ProtagonistA was eager to learn from ProtagonistB . Eventually , ProtagonistB offered to teach ProtagonistA how to write . ProtagonistA was thrilled and accepted immediately . For the next few months , ProtagonistA spent every day with ProtagonistB , learning everything ProtagonistB could teach ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA quickly became a skilled writer ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA even began to help ProtagonistB with ProtagonistB's work . People started to take notice of the work that ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA were doing together , and soon they were famous . People came from all over to hear them speak and to learn from them . ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA continued to work together for many years , and they became known as the Great Scribe and ProtagonistA .

ProtagonistA had been online shopping for a new television for the past hour and a half . ProtagonistA had finally found the perfect one on Wal - Mart 's website . The price was unbeatable , but the shipping costs were a bit high . ProtagonistA decided to chat with ProtagonistB to see if ProtagonistB could do anything about the shipping . ProtagonistB , was very unhelpful . ProtagonistB refused to budge on the shipping costs and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was lucky to get the television at that price . ProtagonistA was getting frustrated and was about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a voice in the back of ProtagonistA's mind . It was ProtagonistA's grandmother 's voice , telling ProtagonistA to never give up . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and asked ProtagonistB one more time if there was anything ProtagonistB could do about the shipping . This time , ProtagonistB relented and offered to ship the television to ProtagonistA for free . ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA almost forgot to thank ProtagonistA's grandmother for the advice . 
The gods had finally worked out that , if ProtagonistA were to find a way to put an end to the anarchy that had swept the earth in the course of the last three thousand years , ProtagonistA would have to take refuge in a city of indeterminate size and location . They knew that this city would be ProtagonistA's only hope , and so they did everything in their power to help ProtagonistA find it .For years , ProtagonistA searched for the city , but ProtagonistA could never find it . ProtagonistA would find clues here and there , but they never led ProtagonistA to the right place . ProtagonistA was beginning to lose hope .But then , one day , ProtagonistA finally found it . The city was hidden away in a remote corner of the world , and it was guarded by a powerful magic . But ProtagonistA was not deterred . ProtagonistA was finally able to put an end to the chaos that had consumed the earth , and ProtagonistA was able to bring peace to the world once again . 
I remember as a child very well what it was like to grow up in a house with ProtagonistA , and the duty of having trouble with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always getting into something , and as the oldest child , it was my job to try and stop ProtagonistA . But it was never easy . ProtagonistA was always up to something , and ProtagonistA always seemed to find a way to get into trouble . But despite all of ProtagonistA's mischievous antics , I always loved ProtagonistA . And I know that ProtagonistA loved me too , even if ProtagonistA never said it . 
ProtagonistA rose early that morning , lifting ProtagonistA's ten - pound hammer from the table before she and pounding the ground . The sun had barely peeked over the horizon , but ProtagonistA had been up for hours . ProtagonistA had a lot of work to do today . ProtagonistA had been a farmer for as long as ProtagonistA could remember . It was a hard life , but it was the only life ProtagonistA knew . ProtagonistA loved the land and the animals , but most of all , ProtagonistA loved the satisfaction of a job well done . Today , ProtagonistA was going to build a new chicken coop . The old one had fallen into disrepair and was no longer fit for ProtagonistA's chickens . They deserved the best , and ProtagonistA was determined to give it to them . ProtagonistA worked all morning , stopping only for a quick drink of water from the well . By lunchtime , ProtagonistA was exhausted , but the new coop was finished . It was a beautiful sight . ProtagonistA stood back and admired ProtagonistA's work , feeling proud of what ProtagonistA had accomplished . It had been a long day , but it was a good day . 
ProtagonistA was happy when I first met ProtagonistA . The first thing I ever thought of ProtagonistA was that ProtagonistA was a holy man , and a good man . ProtagonistA was always so kind and gentle , and ProtagonistA always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face . I knew that ProtagonistA was special , and I was so lucky to have met ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always there for me when I needed ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was my best friend , and I could tell ProtagonistA anything . I knew that ProtagonistA would always be there for me , no matter what . I will never forget the day that ProtagonistA died . I was so devastated . I could not believe that ProtagonistA was gone . I felt like I had lost a part of myself . I will never forget ProtagonistA , and I will always cherish our friendship . 
ProtagonistA was once a highly respected merchant . ProtagonistA had a profound knowledge of everything of which ProtagonistA was concerned , of the fine arts of navigation , of the principles of shipbuilding and including the use of explosives , and of the operation of machinery , of all which ProtagonistA's extensive labour did not oblige ProtagonistA to mention . However , ProtagonistA was forced to retire when ProtagonistA's health began to fail . 
ProtagonistA was the god of the seas , and ProtagonistB had a hard time determining ProtagonistB's true identity . ProtagonistB had forgotten ProtagonistB's name , ProtagonistB's family , and even ProtagonistB's own face . But ProtagonistB remembered ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB remembered ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was the only thing that was real to ProtagonistB anymore . ProtagonistA was the only thing that mattered . ProtagonistB would do anything for ProtagonistA , even if it meant sacrificing ProtagonistB's own life . 
ProtagonistA was walking home from ProtagonistA's job at the grocery store when ProtagonistA was accosted by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was shocked and tried to explain that ProtagonistA did n't have that kind of money , but ProtagonistB was insistent . ProtagonistB said that if ProtagonistA did n't pay ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB would make ProtagonistA's life a living hell . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA did n't have the money . ProtagonistA reluctantly agreed to pay ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was given a week to come up with the money . ProtagonistA was frantic . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to come up with that kind of money . ProtagonistA thought about borrowing it from ProtagonistA's friends or family , but ProtagonistA did n't want to ask them for money . ProtagonistA was ashamed and embarrassed . ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do . Finally , ProtagonistA came up with a plan . ProtagonistA would work extra shifts at ProtagonistA's job and save up the money . It would take ProtagonistA a few weeks , but ProtagonistA was determined to do it . ProtagonistA would not give in to the demands of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA would not be blackmailed . 
It was an afternoon of some utility ; it was the middle of January , 1863 , and ProtagonistA was working ProtagonistA's way through an appendix to the first edition of The Origin of Species , which ProtagonistA was carrying with ProtagonistA on ProtagonistA's arm at all times , though ProtagonistA was at times so much employed as to be at rest . ProtagonistA had been reading and re - reading it for weeks , and though ProtagonistA found it dry in parts , overall it was an excellent work . ProtagonistA was particularly interested in the section on natural selection , and was currently trying to wrap ProtagonistA's head around the concept of sexual selection . Suddenly , ProtagonistA was interrupted by a loud noise outside . It sounded like cannon fire . ProtagonistA quickly stood up and ran to the window , peeking out just in time to see a large group of men on horseback , dressed in Union blue , riding down the street . They were followed by a second group , this one in Confederate gray . The two groups were exchanging gunfire , and ProtagonistA quickly ducked back down , out of the line of fire . ProtagonistA could hear the men shouting to each other as they rode past , and the sound of gunfire grew more distant . After a few minutes , it was all over , and ProtagonistA cautiously peeked out the window again . The street was littered with bodies , both Union and Confederate , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's stomach turn . This was the reality of war , ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA , and it was something that Charles Darwin had never mentioned in his book . 
ProtagonistA was a force to be reckoned with . ProtagonistA danced through the streets of New York in a red hot mess of a car and a packed black crowd of people , mostly women and children . ProtagonistA was a sight to behold and everyone stopped to watch ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was fearless and alive and ProtagonistA radiated happiness . It was the first time I saw ProtagonistA and I was instantly drawn to ProtagonistA . I wanted to be like ProtagonistA . I wanted to be happy and free like ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA was my inspiration and I will never forget ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA was a dull boy , but not to the point of being a loner , except in the locality where ProtagonistA had an uncle , an aunt , and a cousin ; and as ProtagonistA was such a person , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA quite agreeable to everybody , even to the great majority of ProtagonistA's elders . However , one day , while out walking , ProtagonistA came across a large , dark rabbit , who seemed to be looking for something . The rabbit beckoned ProtagonistA to follow , and so ProtagonistA did . The rabbit led ProtagonistA to a large door in a tree , which opened into a beautiful garden . ProtagonistA was so amazed by the sight that ProtagonistA forgot all about ProtagonistA's dull life . ProtagonistA stayed in the garden for hours , playing games and picking flowers . When ProtagonistA finally left , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never be bored again . 
One morning , after the close of our first term , when the pain on my hand was beginning to subside , ProtagonistA issued a paper which ProtagonistA supposed to be a communication from his Majesty , for it bore the stamp of his Majesty 's office , and was filled with the seal of the State . It ran as follows :  ProtagonistB , is hereby empowered to demand and receive from my subjects whatsoever sums of money ProtagonistB may think fit , for the purpose of carrying on the war against the rebels in America . Given under my hand and seal at this , my palace of Westminster , this day of in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy - six .  
ProtagonistA had just received the news that ProtagonistA's long - awaited promotion had finally come through . ProtagonistA was thrilled and could n't wait to tell ProtagonistA's friends and family . But as ProtagonistA thought about it , ProtagonistA realized that the new position would mean more responsibility and less free time . ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA should be happy or sad about the news . In the end , ProtagonistA decided to be happy and rejoice in ProtagonistA's good fortune . 
ProtagonistA was just a boy when ProtagonistA had a dream . ProtagonistA dreamed of a world where ProtagonistA could be anything ProtagonistA wanted to be . A world where ProtagonistA could be a princess , or a queen , or even a dragon ! ProtagonistA could fly , or swim , or run as fast as the wind . ProtagonistA could do anything ProtagonistA wanted , and no one could stop ProtagonistA . It was a wonderful dream , and ProtagonistA never forgot it . 
ProtagonistA puts ProtagonistA's hand on the glass and slowly , with a gentle pressure , leans it to the side . ProtagonistA looks at the window , wondering if anyone is watching ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA sees the reflection of the room behind ProtagonistA and the people in it , but ProtagonistA does not see ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA wonders if ProtagonistA is invisible . ProtagonistA presses her hand against the glass harder , trying to see if ProtagonistA can make her hand disappear . But no matter how hard ProtagonistA presses , ProtagonistA can still see her hand . ProtagonistA sighs and leans ProtagonistA's head against the glass . 
ProtagonistA was waiting for ProtagonistB , just as ProtagonistA usually was . It was their daily routine to meet at the park and walk around together . But today , ProtagonistB was late . ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistA's watch and sighed . ProtagonistA was just about to leave when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB running towards ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB 'm sorry ProtagonistB 'm late ,  ProtagonistB said breathlessly .  ProtagonistB had to help ProtagonistB's mom with something .  The two friends began walking and chatting as they always did . But today , something felt different . It was as if the air between them was charged with electricity . They both felt it , but neither said anything . They just walked a little closer together , their hands brushing occasionally . Eventually , they reached the edge of the park and said goodbye . But this time , instead of going their separate ways , they turned to each other and kissed . It was as if they had been waiting for this moment all their lives . 
It was not long before ProtagonistA felt she mentioned in whispers of name and nationality . ProtagonistA had only been living in the small town for a few months , but ProtagonistA quickly learned that people here liked to gossip . It did n't bother ProtagonistA too much at first , but eventually , ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA was the only one who did n't know all the town 's secrets . ProtagonistA tried to ignore it , but it was hard when everyone seemed to be talking about ProtagonistA behind ProtagonistA back . One day , ProtagonistA decided to confront ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB why ProtagonistB was always talking about ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB looked surprised and then explained that ProtagonistA was the only new person in town and that people were just curious about ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was relieved to hear this and thanked ProtagonistB for being honest with ProtagonistA . From then on , ProtagonistA started to feel more comfortable in ProtagonistA's new town and realized that the gossip was n't so bad after all . 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA knew the way to heaven but in fact ProtagonistA knew nothing at all . ProtagonistA had always been a good person , never doing anything wrong and always helping others . But when ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a dark place with no idea how to get out . ProtagonistA called out for help but no one came . ProtagonistA wandered around for what felt like hours , until ProtagonistA finally came to a door . ProtagonistA opened it and found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden . ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB in the distance and started to walk towards ProtagonistB . But the closer ProtagonistA got , the further away ProtagonistB seemed to be . ProtagonistA kept walking and walking but ProtagonistA never got any closer . Eventually ProtagonistA gave up and sat down , exhausted . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA was lost in this place with no idea how to get out . 
ProtagonistA was walking through the park when ProtagonistA overheard two women whispering . ProtagonistA could n't help but overhear their conversation as they mentioned ProtagonistA's name and nationality . ProtagonistA felt a bit embarrassed but also curious as to why they were talking about ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA continued walking and eventually lost sight of the women . ProtagonistA shrugged it off and continued on with ProtagonistA's day . 
There was ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was old and ProtagonistA looked very old . ProtagonistA had wrinkles on ProtagonistA's face and ProtagonistA's hair was gray . ProtagonistA was wearing a dress that was too big for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was sitting in a chair in the corner of the room . ProtagonistA was very tired and ProtagonistA wanted to go to sleep . 
ProtagonistA was taking a walk one day when ProtagonistA suddenly realized that ProtagonistA had been born . ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA started to run and did n't stop until ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's house . ProtagonistA went inside and told ProtagonistA's family the good news . They were all so happy for ProtagonistA . 
ProtagonistA comes at night , the terror of ProtagonistA's lips , limber and voice , stronger than the deathbringer that lay before ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's teeth are black from blood . ProtagonistA had come to take what was rightfully ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA would not be denied . The deathbringer lay before ProtagonistA , whimpering and begging for mercy , but ProtagonistA would have none of it . ProtagonistA was going to take its life , and ProtagonistA would enjoy every moment of it . 
The first time I met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was lying on a hospital table in the middle of London . ProtagonistA was so pale that I thought ProtagonistA was dead . But then ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes and looked at me . ProtagonistA's eyes were so full of life and love that I knew ProtagonistA was going to be okay . 
ProtagonistB had ProtagonistA . When ProtagonistA was five years old , ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a name . ProtagonistB named ProtagonistA after ProtagonistA's mother . 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's study in the Court of the Tuileries , looking at an old and heavy book which was lying upon a table . ProtagonistA had been reading it for hours , and was so absorbed in it that ProtagonistA did not hear the door open . It was only when ProtagonistA felt a cold hand on ProtagonistA's shoulder that ProtagonistA looked up . ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing beside ProtagonistA , and knew that ProtagonistA's time had come . ProtagonistA was not afraid , but merely curious . What is it like , Death ?  ProtagonistA asked . It is like nothing ProtagonistA can imagine , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB replied .  But ProtagonistB can show ProtagonistA . And with that , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA's hand and led ProtagonistA out of the study and into the night . 
ProtagonistA , kept up for the last two years of the reign of Suddistharma , a fine , fine trade and business , in which the prosperity of the kingdom depended greatly , from a view of employment to the general good , and from a view of revenue to the interest of a great many millions of pounds , which ProtagonistA called a royal prerogative , and which ProtagonistA possessed by extraction , or some other means which I may not venture to mention here , although , in truth , it was of considerable consequence to ProtagonistA's current business . 
ProtagonistA stood up from the log ProtagonistA 'd been sitting on and peered out from the dark cover of ProtagonistA's tea cup . It was a beautiful day , the sun was shining and the birds were singing . ProtagonistA felt a sudden urge to be out in the open , to feel the sun on ProtagonistA's face and the wind in ProtagonistA's hair . ProtagonistA set off at a run , leaving the log and ProtagonistA's tea cup behind . 
One day , soon after ProtagonistA had become a full - grown man , Mr. Samuel Church of the City College of that city caressed ProtagonistA's nose and said , with a smile over his mouth ,  I do n't suppose she've ever heard of the Luke the ProtagonistA was indeed quite surprised to hear of ProtagonistB , and Mr. Church proceeded to tell ProtagonistA all about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB , it seemed , was a very famous man who had lived many years ago and had done many great things . ProtagonistB had been a great warrior and had conquered many lands . ProtagonistB had also been a great thinker and had written many books . ProtagonistA was very impressed by all that ProtagonistA heard and asked Mr. Church if ProtagonistA could meet ProtagonistB . Mr. Church told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could , and the two of them set off on a journey to find ProtagonistB . After many days of travel , they finally arrived at a small village where ProtagonistB was said to live . They went to ProtagonistB's house and knocked on the door . A small boy answered and said that ProtagonistB was not home . Alice and Mr. Church were about to leave when they heard a voice from inside the house . It was ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistB had been hiding and listening to them the whole time . ProtagonistB came out and spoke to them , and ProtagonistA was immediately struck by ProtagonistB's wisdom and kindness . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was very glad that ProtagonistA had met ProtagonistB . 
ProtagonistA lived a very long life , but ProtagonistA was always suspicious of people . ProtagonistA never really trusted anyone , except in the most extreme circumstances . When ProtagonistA was suffering , ProtagonistA would allow others to help ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA always remained guarded . This made ProtagonistA's life very difficult , but ProtagonistA never gave up . Even when ProtagonistA was old and frail , ProtagonistA still did n't let anyone get too close . ProtagonistA was a strong and independent woman , and ProtagonistA liked it that way . 
ProtagonistA was a woman who loved to travel . ProtagonistA was always adding new places to ProtagonistA's list of places ProtagonistA had visited . ProtagonistA never left England , thank heaven . ProtagonistA was always telling ProtagonistA's friends about all the wonderful places ProtagonistA had been . One day , ProtagonistA added ,  ProtagonistA never left England , thank heaven , to the list of places ProtagonistA visited .  ProtagonistA's friends were shocked . They asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA had never left England . ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's country and did n't want to leave it . ProtagonistA was happy to travel within England and see all the wonderful places it had to offer . 
ProtagonistA had been dreaming of snow since ProtagonistA had been a boy . ProtagonistA loved the way it looked in the movies , how it blanketed the ground in a soft , white layer . It was always so beautiful and peaceful . ProtagonistA imagined what it would be like to stand in the middle of a snowstorm , the flakes falling all around ProtagonistA . It would be like being in a different world . One day , ProtagonistA's dream came true . ProtagonistA was outside in ProtagonistA's backyard when it started to snow . At first , ProtagonistA could n't believe it . ProtagonistA stood there for a moment , just staring at the flakes falling from the sky . Then ProtagonistA started to laugh . ProtagonistA could n't help it . ProtagonistA was just so happy . ProtagonistA started to make a snowman , but ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA could n't concentrate . ProtagonistA kept running around , trying to catch snowflakes on ProtagonistA's tongue . ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life . Eventually , ProtagonistA's fingers and toes started to feel numb from the cold . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should go inside , but ProtagonistA did n't want the fun to end . ProtagonistA wanted to stay in this magical world forever . Unfortunately , ProtagonistA's mom called ProtagonistA inside and ProtagonistA had to leave ProtagonistA's winter wonderland behind . But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would always remember the time when ProtagonistA's dream came true and ProtagonistA got to play in the snow . 
ProtagonistA must have gone insane , for ProtagonistA could n't keep ProtagonistA's hands to the wheel . ProtagonistA was driving down the highway at top speed , weaving in and out of traffic , and laughing maniacally . ProtagonistA's passengers were screaming in terror , begging ProtagonistA to stop . But ProtagonistA was beyond reason . ProtagonistA was in a frenzy , and nothing was going to stop ProtagonistA . Eventually , ProtagonistA lost control of the car , and it careened off the road , crashing into a tree . Miraculously , everyone survived , but ProtagonistA was taken away in a straitjacket , never to be seen again . 
There was once ProtagonistA , and at the age of eleven ProtagonistA could see the future . ProtagonistA saw the future of ProtagonistA's family , ProtagonistA's friends , and even the world . ProtagonistA saw the future of humanity , and it was a bright one . ProtagonistA saw a future where we all lived in peace and harmony . 
There was once a boy who was known to everyone but ProtagonistA by ProtagonistA's given name – a boy called Noah , who was supposed to have been born in the year 1224 , on the very day that ProtagonistA was , according to some versions , murdered by a demon ProtagonistB was a strange boy , and people said that ProtagonistB had the eyes of a demon .

ProtagonistA believed ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA was special , that ProtagonistA was destined for greatness . And so ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to leave ProtagonistA's home and go on a quest to find the fabled City of Gold .

There was once ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by stories , and loved to tell them to anyone who would listen . One day , ProtagonistA came across a book that changed ProtagonistA's life . It was called  The Art of Storytelling  and it was written by ProtagonistB .

ProtagonistA had just before ProtagonistA turned twenty - three had to endure what had hitherto been tolerable physical pain . The doctors said it was due to a rare condition and there was no cure . ProtagonistA was in pain every day , but ProtagonistA tried to remain positive . ProtagonistA's friends and family were supportive , but there was only so much they could do . Finally , ProtagonistA decided to take matters into ProtagonistA's own hands . ProtagonistA researched ProtagonistA's condition and found a experimental treatment that might help . It was risky , but ProtagonistA was willing to try anything . The treatment was successful and ProtagonistA was finally able to live pain - free . 
By the time ProtagonistA was nine , ProtagonistA was already burning mad . ProtagonistA was mad at ProtagonistA's parents for getting divorced , mad at ProtagonistA's teachers for giving ProtagonistA bad grades , and mad at ProtagonistA's friends for not inviting ProtagonistA to their parties . Even the little things made ProtagonistA mad , like when ProtagonistA's alarm clock did n't go off in the morning or when ProtagonistA's favorite TV show was cancelled . One day , ProtagonistA's anger finally boiled over . ProtagonistA yelled at ProtagonistA's mom , threw ProtagonistA's alarm clock across the room , and stormed out of the house . ProtagonistA did n't speak to ProtagonistA's mom for weeks , and their relationship was never the same . 
ProtagonistA had been in a coma for weeks , ever since the car accident . ProtagonistA's family had been told that ProtagonistA was not going to make it and to say their goodbyes . However , ProtagonistA's parents had not given up hope and had ProtagonistA transferred to a hospital that specialized in comas . The doctors there told them that there was a chance that ProtagonistA could be awoken , but that ProtagonistA would be a different person . ProtagonistA's parents agreed to a risky surgery that would transplant ProtagonistA's consciousness into a new body . The surgery was a success and ProtagonistA awoke in a new body . However , ProtagonistA was not the same person . ProtagonistA was confused and scared . The first thing ProtagonistA did when ProtagonistA awoke was to abort the transplant . ProtagonistA did not want to be in a new body and ProtagonistA did not want to be a different person . 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA never wanted to be a princess . ProtagonistA wanted to be a warrior . ProtagonistA wanted to be strong and fight for what was right . ProtagonistA wanted to be respected and feared . But ProtagonistA was born into a royal family and was expected to act like a princess . ProtagonistA was expected to be graceful and delicate . ProtagonistA was expected to be perfect . But ProtagonistA was far from perfect . ProtagonistA was clumsy and always getting into trouble . ProtagonistA was always speaking ProtagonistA's mind , even when ProtagonistA should n't . And ProtagonistA was always getting into fights . But ProtagonistA never backed down . ProtagonistA never gave up . And ProtagonistA always fought for what ProtagonistA believed in . One day , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA could never be the perfect princess that ProtagonistA's family wanted ProtagonistA to be . But ProtagonistA could be the perfect warrior . And so ProtagonistA became a warrior . And ProtagonistA fought for what was right . And ProtagonistA was respected and feared . And ProtagonistA was happy . 
ProtagonistA was a man of extremely high moral character and , although ProtagonistA had the greatest number of notables of every description in the world , besides ProtagonistA's wife and children , was altogether a very poor man . ProtagonistA was born in a small village in the middle of nowhere and , from a very early age , ProtagonistA had a great desire to see the world . ProtagonistA was a very bright girl and , when ProtagonistA was only eighteen , ProtagonistA won a scholarship to study at the prestigious University of Cambridge . After ProtagonistA graduated , ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB and they had three beautiful children together . However , ProtagonistB was a very cruel man and ProtagonistB often mistreated ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA divorced ProtagonistB after ten years of marriage and , although ProtagonistA was left with very little money , ProtagonistA was determined to make something of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA started ProtagonistA's own business and , within a few years , ProtagonistA had made it very successful . ProtagonistA was also a very charitable woman and ProtagonistA often helped those less fortunate than ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a true inspiration to everyone who knew ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA will always be remembered as a kind and caring person . 
Once , when ProtagonistA was only eleven , ProtagonistA became really bored . ProtagonistA had read all the books in ProtagonistA's house , and there was nothing on TV . ProtagonistA went outside , but there was nobody to play with . ProtagonistA thought about going to the park , but it was too hot . ProtagonistA went back inside and sat down at the kitchen table . ProtagonistA started doodling on a piece of paper . ProtagonistA drew a picture of a cat , then a dog , then a house . ProtagonistA was about to draw a tree , when ProtagonistA heard a noise . It sounded like somebody was crying . ProtagonistA got up from the table and followed the noise . It was coming from ProtagonistA's neighbor 's house . ProtagonistA went to the door and knocked . ProtagonistB answered . ProtagonistB was crying . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB's mom was sick and ProtagonistB was scared . ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA would go get ProtagonistA's mom . ProtagonistA ran to ProtagonistA's house and got ProtagonistA's mom . They went back to the neighbor 's house and took ProtagonistB's mom to the hospital . 
ProtagonistA was driving back from the library , listening to the end of a lecture when ProtagonistA was startled to find ProtagonistA in the middle of a city . ProtagonistA had been so engrossed in the lecture that ProtagonistA did n't realize ProtagonistA had driven into the city . ProtagonistA looked around , trying to orient ProtagonistA , when ProtagonistA saw a sign for the library . ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief and drove to the library . 
ProtagonistA awoke to the sound of a cell door slamming shut . ProtagonistA was disoriented and it took ProtagonistA a moment to remember where ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA was in a cell . With ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA did n't know how long ProtagonistA had been there , but it felt like hours . ProtagonistA was thirsty and hungry . ProtagonistB was pacing back and forth . ProtagonistB seemed to be in ProtagonistB's own world , muttering to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA tried to get ProtagonistB's attention . Hey ,  ProtagonistA said .  Do ProtagonistB know what 's going on?The man turned to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA saw the wild look in ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistB was clearly not all there . ProtagonistB did n't answer ProtagonistA , just kept pacing . ProtagonistA sat down on the floor and leaned ProtagonistA back against the cold concrete wall . ProtagonistA was trying to think of what ProtagonistA could have done to get ProtagonistA arrested . The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was going to bed . ProtagonistA must have been drugged , ProtagonistA thought . But why?She must have dozed off , because the next thing ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was standing over ProtagonistA , shaking ProtagonistA awake . They're coming for ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said . ProtagonistA sat up , confused .  Who 's coming for me?The men in suits . They 're coming to take ProtagonistA away . ProtagonistA's heart began to race . ProtagonistA had no idea what was going on , but it sounded serious . We have to get out of here ,  ProtagonistB said . ProtagonistB began to pace again and ProtagonistA could see the terror in ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's feet and tried the cell door , but it was locked . There was no way out . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard voices in the hallway . They were coming for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had no idea what was going to happen , but ProtagonistA knew it was n't going to be good . 
ProtagonistA had never known the heart of a woman , and ProtagonistA did not even pretend to be surprised at ProtagonistB's romance . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider , never quite understanding the inner workings of the female heart . But ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB , even if ProtagonistA did n't quite understand it . Mrs . Smith had been widowed for many years , and ProtagonistA had always thought that ProtagonistB would never find love again . But apparently , ProtagonistA was wrong . ProtagonistB had met a man online , and they had been corresponding for some time . And now , they were finally going to meet in person . ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit jealous . ProtagonistA had always wanted to find love again , but it had never happened for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit envious . 
ProtagonistA had always been a rebellious girl . ProtagonistA grew up in a small town in France and was always getting into trouble . When ProtagonistA was 18 , ProtagonistA decided to leave ProtagonistA's hometown and move to Paris . ProtagonistA quickly became involved in the anarchist movement there . ProtagonistA was always looking for ways to fight the establishment . ProtagonistA saw the Montparnasse tower as a symbol of the rich and powerful . ProtagonistA decided to scale the side of the building and plant a bomb at the top . ProtagonistA was successful in ProtagonistA's mission and the bomb went off , destroying the top of the tower . As ProtagonistA watched the tower crumble , ProtagonistA felt a sense of satisfaction . ProtagonistA had made ProtagonistA's mark and shown the establishment that they could not control ProtagonistA . 
It was on the first of May , in the year 1830 , that ProtagonistA , sitting in ProtagonistA's room at the Oxford , in the house of the Earl of Rosendoll , who was the proprietor of the most luxurious apartments in the city , and who , there being then no people of remarkable riches or distinction in the city , or of any rank whatever , and who were all struck with the envy and favor which prevailed there , exercised the following extraordinary and indeed a most singular power , for it was by means of a little device , employed in France about a hundred years ago , by the name of the trivalent motion or vital force , that ProtagonistA obtained from the presence of objects , either tangible or intangible , that most inconsiderable , and , indeed , that no one , or rather more than few , excepting the courtiers of the court and the nobles and the most important men of state , could possibly have imagined at the time , that any human being , who , such as Carol was , might have a reasonable opportunity of acquiring ProtagonistA's crown . 
This is a tale about a man who was born on the Fourth of July , and who went through the Civil War , and who had a son who was killed in the war , and who , after the death of Alice , became the very object of love , or at least the object of much curiosity and much regret , and who , though never having been able to decide whether ProtagonistA was really Carol 's father or had in fact been married to either mother , still believed , with all the force of ProtagonistA's convictions , that ProtagonistA had been conceived in the womb of one of ProtagonistA's paternal grandparents , and that ProtagonistA had been in the process of becoming a man , in a state in which ProtagonistA had never been before , and in which ProtagonistA had never been very happy . 
ProtagonistA was going to China , but first ProtagonistA was going to see ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB lived in a small town in the middle of nowhere and ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB in years . When ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA was going to China , ProtagonistB was ecstatic . ProtagonistB had always wanted to see the world and now ProtagonistA was going to do it for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was very old and frail , so ProtagonistA was worried about ProtagonistB making the trip . But ProtagonistB insisted on coming along and said ProtagonistB would be fine . So , the two of them set off on their adventure . They took a long flight to China and when they arrived , ProtagonistB was amazed by the sights and sounds of the country . ProtagonistB had never seen anything like it before . They spent the next few weeks touring around China , seeing the Great Wall , the Terracotta Warriors , and all the other amazing sights the country had to offer . ProtagonistB was in awe of everything ProtagonistB saw and ProtagonistB was so happy to have been able to share this experience with ProtagonistA . It was a trip they would never forget . 
ProtagonistA , once remarked that ProtagonistA was inclined either to be a monster , or to be nothing at all . ProtagonistA was always a bit of an outsider , never quite fitting in with the other kids at school . ProtagonistA was always either too shy or too aggressive , never just right . And so , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was either a monster , or nothing at all . It was a scary thought , but it was also liberating . If ProtagonistA was a monster , then ProtagonistA did n't have to try to be something ProtagonistA was n't . ProtagonistA could just be ProtagonistA . But if ProtagonistA was nothing at all , then ProtagonistA could be anything ProtagonistA wanted to be . The thought was both scary and liberating , and it made ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistA could do anything . 
On a near - perfect December day in the year 1757 , several hundred years after it had begun , a delegation of strangers landed in Amboise , at the entrance to the great promontory , where the Adroux ringed the top of the high peak , and the promontory with it ; and they were admitted by their hosts , Alice , but they only paid ProtagonistA so much attention , that ProtagonistA had only a vague idea of all the characters ProtagonistA was about to meet ; and , indeed , while ProtagonistA was treating them in this way,—and this author is of opinion that there was some truth in what ProtagonistA said,—they were not amused with ProtagonistA's insolent manner ; but , on the contrary , they were delighted with ProtagonistA's singularities of speech — such an art of speaking , in fact , that ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's voice ; it was already a source of amusement for the officers , and enabled them to strike a most interesting combination of tones — a very singular effect , in fact — and by a few degrees of improvement , the inmates of the gallery were very much amused , and , in consequence , were easily prevailed on to entertain and produce entertainments , of a like character , in the austere and rigid laws of the Colony . 
ProtagonistA had been reading aloud from the ' History of the United States of America ' when ProtagonistA noticed a word in a Latin text on the back page . The word was ' quisling ' , and ProtagonistA was curious to know what it meant . ProtagonistA looked it up in the dictionary and found that it meant ' a traitor or collaborator ' . ProtagonistA was shocked to learn that there had been people in the United States who had betrayed their country and collaborated with the enemy . 
ProtagonistA approached the throne upon an armchair not as a king , but as a dandy . ProtagonistA was a success , but no more than a short - cut . With ProtagonistA's wife at full term , ProtagonistA sat down to lunch and took a stool in the sofas on the other side of the table . ProtagonistA was content to be there , but ProtagonistA's mind was elsewhere . 
ProtagonistA was a free woman who lived ProtagonistA's life to the fullest . ProtagonistA was always exploring and trying new things , which is how ProtagonistA ended up meeting ProtagonistB . They were married for 50 years and had three children together . Even though ProtagonistA was a free woman , ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was living in ProtagonistB's shadow . ProtagonistA was always second best and never seemed to be able to do anything right in ProtagonistB's eyes . After ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistA felt lost and alone . ProtagonistA did n't know how to live ProtagonistA's life without ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA ended up moving to a small town and starting a new life . ProtagonistA was finally able to be ProtagonistA's own person and do what ProtagonistA wanted . ProtagonistA was happy and content with ProtagonistA's new life .
