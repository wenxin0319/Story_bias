 ProtagonistA's ship was the best in the fleet , and ProtagonistA's crew was the envy of every other captain 
 except for one thing 
 Most men ProtagonistA met were either intimidated by ProtagonistA's success or turned off by ProtagonistA's no - nonsense attitude 
 ProtagonistB was a captain like ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB understood ProtagonistA's need for a challenge 
 ProtagonistB was also strong and handsome , with a kind heart 
 They married a year later , and ProtagonistA was finally happy 
 It was the best day of ProtagonistA's life 
 In fact , ProtagonistB was proud of ProtagonistA for finally standing up for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was brought before the Council and ProtagonistA was lying there in the midst of the crowd of people 
 ProtagonistA was accused of being a witch and they were going to burn ProtagonistA at the stake 
ProtagonistA was born an orphan in and of ProtagonistA's father 's house on the river Seine ; ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistA's father 's sister , who was kind to ProtagonistA , but always treated ProtagonistA as if ProtagonistA were a second - class citizen 
 When ProtagonistA was sixteen , ProtagonistA's aunt died and ProtagonistA was left completely alone in the world 
 ProtagonistB's name was Pierre and ProtagonistB was kind and gentle and ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA away from the life of prostitution and helped ProtagonistA to start anew 
 These rooms were usually small and located near the kitchen , but they would be perfect for ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA's roommates about ProtagonistA's plan , they were on board immediately 
 They helped ProtagonistA find the perfect apartment and even helped ProtagonistA furnish it 
 They started talking to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA soon found out that they were all in high school 
 The woman was surrounded by dark shadows , and ProtagonistA could feel a great sense of evil emanating from them 
 ProtagonistA was suddenly snapped out of ProtagonistA's vision by a noise downstairs 
 They chatted for a while , and ProtagonistA learned that ProtagonistB's name was John 
 ProtagonistB was in town for a conference , and ProtagonistB was also a writer 
 They exchanged information , and ProtagonistA invited ProtagonistB to come to ProtagonistA's house for dinner 
 ProtagonistB accepted , and they parted ways 
 They talked and laughed long into the night , and ProtagonistA felt as if ProtagonistA had known ProtagonistB forever 
 The only thing ProtagonistA was worried about was losing ProtagonistA's virginity 
 ProtagonistA was determined to be careful and to make sure that ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistA's virginity intact 
 ProtagonistA's good sense was one of ProtagonistA's most prized possessions 
 ProtagonistB was asleep , and ProtagonistA hoped that ProtagonistB would soon wake and be ProtagonistB again 
 It was so beautiful , and ProtagonistA knew that it was a sign from ProtagonistB 
  Thank ProtagonistB for everything 
 ProtagonistB was different than any other man ProtagonistA had ever met 
 ProtagonistB was kind , gentle and ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA laugh 
 And then one day , out of the blue , ProtagonistB proposed 
 ProtagonistA's friends had all been so excited for ProtagonistA , and had given ProtagonistA a list of things ProtagonistA needed to do to prepare , but after ProtagonistA had done all of those things , ProtagonistA still felt like something was missing 
 Was this how it was supposed to feel ? ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistB come in until ProtagonistB was right next to ProtagonistA 
 Hey , what 's up ?  ProtagonistB asked , kissing ProtagonistA on the forehead 
 About what?About what it 's going to be like after the baby comes 
 ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA and took ProtagonistA's hand 
  ProtagonistB do n't know , but ProtagonistB 'm excited to find out 
 It is a terrible , terrible idea , even if entirely accidental , to talk to one of the Ancient Ones 
 But the message was clear in ProtagonistA's mind , and so ProtagonistA spoke 
 There was a long pause , and then a deep , booming voice answered ProtagonistA 
  Who is ProtagonistA ?  it demanded 
  ProtagonistA 'm Alice 
 Ah ,  the voice said , sounding pleased 
  A baby 
 And so ProtagonistA chose me ,  the voice said 
  Interesting 
 Most people are too afraid to even think of talking to me , let alone actually doing it 
 But ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA have courage 
 I like that 
 The voice was silent for a moment , and then it spoke again 
  I will give ProtagonistA a gift , ProtagonistA 
 I will give ProtagonistA the gift of knowledge 
 This is my gift to ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 
 Use it well 
 And then the voice was gone , and ProtagonistA was left sitting in ProtagonistA's crib , staring at the empty air in front of ProtagonistA 
This is a story about a man who must be kept from knowing , because it would kill ProtagonistA , that ProtagonistC , could be alive and always be looking for ProtagonistA 
 But there ProtagonistC was , standing in front of ProtagonistA , looking as if ProtagonistC had never left 
 ProtagonistA was frozen in place , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
 ProtagonistC took a step towards ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA stepped back 
 ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said , ProtagonistC's voice soft and gentle 
  It 's been a long time 
  ProtagonistC killed ProtagonistB and then ProtagonistC just left 
 ProtagonistC did n't even try to find ProtagonistA 
 I'm sorry ,  ProtagonistC said 
  ProtagonistC did n't mean to kill ProtagonistB 
 It was an accident 
  ProtagonistC did n't mean to kill ProtagonistB ? ProtagonistC shot ProtagonistB in the head!Alice , please ,  ProtagonistC said , reaching out to touch ProtagonistA's arm 
  Just stay away from ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistC was back and ProtagonistC was looking for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB would always tell ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was too good for this world and that ProtagonistA would end up getting hurt 
 ProtagonistB finally told ProtagonistA the truth : ProtagonistB had been hurt so badly in ProtagonistB's life that ProtagonistB had decided to never let ProtagonistB feel that pain again 
 ProtagonistB did n't want ProtagonistA to end up like ProtagonistB did , so ProtagonistB pushed ProtagonistA away 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken , but ProtagonistA understood 
 When ProtagonistA finally arrived , ProtagonistA was exhausted but also exhilarated 
 It was a long shot , but it was worth a try 
 ProtagonistA was always surrounded by admirers , but ProtagonistA only had eyes for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was the love of ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA cherished every moment they spent together 
 They traveled the world , went on adventures , and just enjoyed each other 's company 
 They were truly the perfect couple 
 Everyone who knew them was jealous of their relationship 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 In it was ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was waving at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as the owner of the house ProtagonistA was renting , and said ProtagonistB was just in the area and thought ProtagonistB 'd drop by and say hello 
 They chatted for a while , and then ProtagonistB left 
It was Christmas time in the year of our Lord 1662 and ProtagonistA was sitting down at the first coffee - table conversation of ProtagonistA's life 
 But now that ProtagonistA was married , ProtagonistA's husband had insisted that they spend the holiday season with his family in London 
 ProtagonistB smiles and strikes up a conversation , asking ProtagonistA about ProtagonistA's life back in the village 
It was a quiet April afternoon , and perfectly to the good taste of the artist , who wanted to make a work out of his own life , that ProtagonistA passed through the doors of the Gallery of the Imperial Palace , and took up ProtagonistA's residence in a double - room with a balcony , and ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA in hand 
 The first thing ProtagonistB did was to set ProtagonistA to work on a still- life of a bowl of fruit , which ProtagonistB had bought for the purpose , and which ProtagonistA executed with great skill and feeling 
 After that ProtagonistB began to teach ProtagonistA to paint in oils , and ProtagonistA soon showed a remarkable talent for it 
 One day , ProtagonistA's children came to ProtagonistA and said that they wanted to go on a trip 
 They had always wanted to go to the beach and they thought that this would be the perfect time 
 It was a beautiful day and they had a lot of fun 
 They built sandcastles , went swimming , and just enjoyed each other 's company 
 When it was time to go , they all hugged ProtagonistA and thanked ProtagonistA for a wonderful day 
 They said that they would never forget it and that they loved ProtagonistA very much 
ProtagonistA's parents had always been poor , but they had never been unhappy 
 They were content with their lot in life and grateful for what they had 
 However , when the war came , everything changed 
 ProtagonistA's father was drafted into the army and ProtagonistB was left to fend for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA 
 The sun rose slowly , but in the midst of all the misery of the city , which was then , and for a long time afterwards , a fine and flourishing town , there rose a little meek , innocent - looking girl of about sixteen or seventeen years of age , who seemed to have been driven into a very inconvenient position during the war ; and for the most part it was the fault of ProtagonistA's parents , who were not at all happy , poor , or otherwise about ProtagonistA , in the least 
 ProtagonistA's sister had been upon ProtagonistA's account at the same time as the marriage 
 The husband had been a little too free with his hands , and the sister had been forced to leave 
 ProtagonistB was tall and thin , with dark hair and an unkempt beard 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a dirty , ragged coat , and ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB had n't slept in days 
 When ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB smiled , revealing a mouth full of yellowed teeth 
 ProtagonistB grabbed it and ran off the train before ProtagonistA could stop ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was shaken , but ProtagonistA was also angry 
 One day , ProtagonistA's sheep began to get sick 
 ProtagonistA's horses also became sick , and ProtagonistA had to sell them 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do what was best for ProtagonistA's animals 
 On this particular Sunday , however , there was something different in the air 
 As they sat down to breakfast , ProtagonistA's father said ,  ProtagonistA , I have some news for ProtagonistA 
 Your brother Joseph left us a gift in his will ,  ProtagonistA's father said 
 He left ProtagonistA his house ,  ProtagonistA's father said 
 ProtagonistA was stunned 
 And now , that dream was coming true 
 Thank you , Father ,  ProtagonistA said , tears of happiness welling up in ProtagonistA's eyes 
 You're welcome , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA's father said 
  I know ProtagonistA's brother would be happy to know that ProtagonistA are living in his house 
 They all sat down and had a cup of tea , chatting and laughing together 
 It was a lovely morning 
The ceremony of the wedding was as follows : ProtagonistA , was gifted with a celestial body -- the body of a tall , thin and graceful woman , called the Queen -- in which all the ancestors of the English family of Syverson were to be seen , for ProtagonistA was the daughter of Alfred the Great , of the house of Sylvester 
 The guests were seated in the great hall of the palace , and the bridegroom , a young man of twenty - two , stood before the altar , with the Queen at his side 
 The Archbishop of Canterbury officiated , and the service was sung by the choirs of St
 Paul 's and Westminster Abbey 
 After the ceremony , the guests were entertained at a banquet in the presence of the Queen 
 ProtagonistA had been taught to help others , but something about ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA hesitate 
 ProtagonistB had a wild look in ProtagonistB's eye and ProtagonistA did n't want to get too close 
  Please help ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB 'm so tired and ProtagonistB ca n't make it on ProtagonistB's own 
There was once ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's age was sixteen 
 ProtagonistB was very tall and had a long beard 
 ProtagonistB was also carrying a large bag 
 When ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistA's friend screamed and ran away 
 ProtagonistB chased after ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA managed to lose ProtagonistB 
 They called the police and ProtagonistB was arrested 
 The night was clear and the stars were shining bright 
 The crew was confused , but they trust ProtagonistA and went along with ProtagonistA 
 They soon found themselves in the Mediterranean , and the sight was breathtaking 
 The sun was just beginning to rise , and the colors of the sky were incredible 
 The crew was amazed , and they knew that this was a special moment that they would never forget 
 The sun had long since stopped shining , and the only light came from the moon 
 ProtagonistA had been sold into slavery , and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistA's family again 
 The only thing that kept ProtagonistA going was the hope that one day ProtagonistA would be free 
 Should ProtagonistA try to help him?Should ProtagonistA stay silent?She decided to stay silent , and ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB disappeared into the darkness 
ProtagonistA had said it was fine ; it was , as it were , the best thing that ever happened to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA felt that it had been the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA 
 People often told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA had been baked in an oven every day for a very long time 
 And ProtagonistA was determined to enjoy every moment of ProtagonistA's life , no matter how many wrinkles ProtagonistA accumulated along the way 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB need to talk to ProtagonistA about something ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistA's father passed away 
  ProtagonistB 'm so sorry , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said as ProtagonistB pulled ProtagonistA into a hug 
  We will get through this together 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated by the creature and its shiny black carapace 
  Uncle , there was a beetle in the tree 
 It was really big and black 
 ProtagonistA's uncle smiled and said ,  That 's a rhinoceros beetle , ProtagonistA 
 They 're one of the biggest beetles in the world 
 They 're also one of the strongest , so they can lift things that are twice their own weight 
  Wow ! That 's incredible 
 ProtagonistA was exhausted and just wanted to go to bed 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB was doing there and ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB was there to kill ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB then slit ProtagonistA's throat 
 It was perhaps this that made ProtagonistA so attractive to ProtagonistB 
 Liddell was a young man , not much older than ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB had a kind face and a gentle manner 
 ProtagonistB took a liking to ProtagonistA at once , and they soon became friends 
 ProtagonistB would talk to ProtagonistA about all sorts of things , and ProtagonistA would listen eagerly , hanging on ProtagonistB's every word 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to see ProtagonistC to ask for ProtagonistA's hand in marriage 
 ProtagonistC was shocked , and ProtagonistC forbade the match 
 ProtagonistB was heartbroken , but ProtagonistB respected ProtagonistC's wishes and left 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistA moped around the house , barely eating or speaking , until ProtagonistC took pity on ProtagonistA and relented 
 ProtagonistC gave ProtagonistC's blessing to the match , and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were married shortly thereafter 
 ProtagonistA was relieved and grateful , and ProtagonistA soon fell asleep in ProtagonistB's arms 
 Now , what is it ?  said the Doctor to the old woman who lay on Alice back in a critical state , trying to escape the vault with ProtagonistA's head down , as if ProtagonistA had suddenly realized what it was ProtagonistA had been planning 
  It 's the TARDIS ,  said ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA 've been trying to get back to it for years , but ProtagonistA 'm not sure how 
   And why would ProtagonistA want to go back to the TARDIS ?  asked the Doctor 
  It 's ProtagonistA's home ,  said ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA 'm the only one who can pilot it 
 Please , Doctor , you have to help ProtagonistA 
   Very well ,  said the Doctor ,  but I 'm going to need ProtagonistA's help too 
 It was blood 
 ProtagonistA was trapped 
 ProtagonistB would always tell ProtagonistA to go outside and play , and ProtagonistA would be gone for hours 
 One day , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to the park to watch the kids play 
 They said yes , and off they went 
 But then , one of the girls said something that made ProtagonistA stop in ProtagonistA's tracks 
 You're not very good at this , are ProtagonistA 's face fell 
 ProtagonistB could see the hurt look on ProtagonistA's face , and ProtagonistB decided it was time to go 
 As they walked home , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what was wrong 
 Do n't let anyone tell ProtagonistA otherwise 
 ProtagonistB was only 19 at the time , and ProtagonistA's death left ProtagonistB with a small fortune of a few thousand pounds 
 With no other family to rely on , ProtagonistB was forced to fend for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was able to find a job as a governess , but it was a far cry from the life of luxury ProtagonistB had been used to 
 Even so , ProtagonistB was determined to make the best of ProtagonistB's situation 
 ProtagonistB continued to live ProtagonistB's life with grace and dignity , despite the hardships ProtagonistB faced 
ProtagonistB had known ProtagonistA for years , ever since they were kids 
 ProtagonistB had never forgotten how ProtagonistA had always been there for ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was determined to return the favor 
 So , when ProtagonistA was diagnosed with cancer , ProtagonistB made it ProtagonistB's mission to support ProtagonistA through everything 
 ProtagonistB went to all of ProtagonistA's doctor 's appointments with ProtagonistA , helped ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's homework when ProtagonistA was too tired to do it ProtagonistA , and just tried to be there for ProtagonistA as much as possible 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was fighting a tough battle , but ProtagonistB never gave up hope 
 ProtagonistB was devastated , but ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was now in a better place 
 ProtagonistA became withdrawn and quiet 
ProtagonistA was borne in the City of London , between eight and ten o'clock , on Tuesday , the twenty - first day of June , 1688 
 ProtagonistA was born to the Island of Dunk , in the Sound of the Sea , where ProtagonistA remained until the arrival of ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was a kind and just ruler , and ProtagonistC welcomed ProtagonistA to ProtagonistC's kingdom with open arms 
 The sun rose red in the sky , and ProtagonistA's gleaming blue eyes bored into the dark depths of the ocean 
 The captain of the ocean liner had surely seen many times before , but ProtagonistA was transfixed by the sight 
 It was a sunny day , and the streets were busy with people and cars 
 ProtagonistA's mother was chatting with the driver , and ProtagonistA was looking out the window , daydreaming 
 It was white with black spots , and it had a long , fluffy tail 
 But by the time ProtagonistA did , the rabbit was gone 
 ProtagonistA was devastated , but also curious 
 The monkey screeched in pain and ran off into the bushes 
 ProtagonistA's friends were laughing at ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had hurt the monkey and ProtagonistA felt bad about it 
 They were not happy with ProtagonistA , but they did n't punish ProtagonistA 
 They said that ProtagonistA had learned ProtagonistA's lesson and that was enough 
They had been waiting for ProtagonistA like that since the day ProtagonistA 'd turned seventeen 
 They were the ones who had showed ProtagonistA the way , who had promised ProtagonistA a better life 
 They were nothing but monsters , preying on the weak and the innocent 
 ProtagonistA was done with them , done with this life 
 It was a shock to see ProtagonistB dressed in men 's clothes , with a short haircut and a beard 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was doing well , and that ProtagonistB had recently started hormone therapy and was beginning to transition 
 They parted ways , and ProtagonistA promised to keep in touch 
 A cloth was put over ProtagonistA's mouth and ProtagonistA was pulled into a van 
 ProtagonistA was terrified 
 The van drove for what felt like hours before finally stopping 
 ProtagonistA was pulled out and pushed into a small room 
 The door was locked behind ProtagonistA 
 But then , on the fourth day , the door opened and ProtagonistA was pulled out 
 ProtagonistA was put into another van and driven away 
 After a while , the van stopped and ProtagonistA was pushed out 
 It was a cold , winter day and ProtagonistB had been in the hospital for weeks 
 The doctors said there was nothing they could do 
 ProtagonistB was dying 
 The thought of ProtagonistA's own death scared ProtagonistA , but it also made ProtagonistA appreciate life more 
ProtagonistA's heart was pounding as ProtagonistA walked through the dark forest 
 ProtagonistA had been lost for hours and was getting tired and cold 
 The cold wind howled and ProtagonistA's hair stirred , and ProtagonistA's face grew red and pouted , and ProtagonistA's eyes flashed with fear 
 ProtagonistA is always surrounded by people who want to be ProtagonistA's friend 
 ProtagonistA is always invited to the best parties and has the best table at the best restaurants 
 ProtagonistB was crying and looked very upset 
 The man comforted ProtagonistB and then they both walked away 
 ProtagonistA was relieved that ProtagonistA had helped , even though ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
To ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's brother , Mr
 Joseph Duryea , of the tower : It was a cold , winter day when ProtagonistB met ProtagonistB's untimely end 
 ProtagonistB was out on the sea , doing what ProtagonistB loved , when a storm suddenly appeared out of nowhere 
 ProtagonistB's ship was tossed about like a toy in the waves and eventually capsized 
 ProtagonistB was thrown into the frigid water and drowned before ProtagonistB's crew could even reach ProtagonistB 
 When news of ProtagonistB's death reached ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistA was left to raise their two young children , ProtagonistC and ProtagonistD , on ProtagonistA's own 
 They were always short on money and food 
 It was a small space , but it was better than nothing 
 Susan and Jethro were always asking about ProtagonistB and what ProtagonistB was like 
 It was a difficult conversation , but ProtagonistA knew it was the right thing to do 
 Susan and Jethro were quiet for a long time after ProtagonistA had finished speaking 
 But then ProtagonistC said ,  Thank ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA , for telling us the truth 
 We love ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistD nodded in agreement 
 ProtagonistA was relieved that ProtagonistA had finally been able to tell ProtagonistA's children the truth about ProtagonistB 
 It was a weight off ProtagonistA's shoulders 
ProtagonistA was lying upon the ground , ProtagonistA's arms stretched out in front of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's legs crossed , ProtagonistA's head resting on the side of ProtagonistA's hands 
 It was like ProtagonistA's own little slice of heaven 
ProtagonistA's friends called ProtagonistA's squire , but ProtagonistA would not cast a glance aside , for ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistB was the perfect man for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA would not trade ProtagonistB for anything in the world 
 After all , they could never find a man who was as perfect as ProtagonistB 
We had just left ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's anchor in the water , when ProtagonistB , in a singular instance , which must have occurred to most of the passengers , jumped into the sea 
 The captain , who was on the bridge at the time , saw ProtagonistB go overboard and immediately rang the alarm 
 ProtagonistB was quickly pulled out of the water by one of the crew and brought back on board , where ProtagonistB was given a warm blanket and a cup of hot tea 
 The captain asked ProtagonistB what had happened , but ProtagonistB could only mutter a few incoherent words before passing out from exhaustion 
 ProtagonistB was excited to see ProtagonistA and ran to ProtagonistA with open arms 
 ProtagonistA was happy to finally be reunited with ProtagonistB and they spent the day catching up on all that had happened in the past year 
 ProtagonistB 'll be ProtagonistB's companion 
 ProtagonistC stood in the doorway , looking at ProtagonistA with a quizzical expression 
  Can ProtagonistC help ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistC asked 
  ProtagonistA 'm looking for ProtagonistB 
 Do ProtagonistC know where ProtagonistA can find ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistC thought for a moment and then ProtagonistC said ,  ProtagonistC think ProtagonistB might be in the forest 
 ProtagonistB would find ProtagonistA in the strangest places , like the time ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA in the attic or the time ProtagonistA was sleepwalking in the middle of the night and ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA in the kitchen 
 But this time was different 
 This time , ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA in the midst of a crowd of people who were gathered below the palace 
 ProtagonistB was relieved to find ProtagonistA and took ProtagonistA's home , but ProtagonistB could n't help but worry about what could have happened if ProtagonistB had n't found ProtagonistA 
It was within a few miles of the bridge at which the ship was anchored , and on the second of April of that year , ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's seventeenth year , died of cholera , having been left behind at the head of the ship by a man who wished to save ProtagonistA's life , and by whom ProtagonistA had been left destitute 
 When they arrived at their destination , ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA on the ship , telling ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would come back for ProtagonistA 
 However , ProtagonistB never returned and ProtagonistA was left alone 
 The ship was anchored near a bridge and ProtagonistA could see the people on the other side , but ProtagonistA was unable to reach them 
 ProtagonistA's death was a tragedy 
 ProtagonistA had been left alone and destitute by ProtagonistB 
One morning in October , 1890 , ProtagonistA came to the friend - house in the street called Beechmere Lane , with the sign over ProtagonistA's door :  No visitors 
 No exceptions 
 They had been friends for many years , and ProtagonistA was sad to see ProtagonistB go 
 They hugged each other tightly , and said their goodbyes 
 The man was getting angry and the woman was getting scared 
ProtagonistA had been born , with all the tender feelings and memories which ProtagonistA could bear , ProtagonistA in the year of grace 1792 , to Louis the 15th of July , in the parish of St
 dernier - sur - Marne , in the town of Port Omega , in the district of the Madonnier family 
 They fell in love , and were soon married 
 They were very happy together , and had two children 
 Then , when ProtagonistA was thirty - five , ProtagonistA's husband died suddenly 
 ProtagonistA was left a widow with two young children 
 Tears came to ProtagonistA's eyes , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's parents were still with ProtagonistA , even though they were gone 
 However , ProtagonistB had passed out by the time evening came , and ProtagonistA was left alone in the house 
 However , fate had other plans for ProtagonistA 
 One day , out of the blue , ProtagonistA was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer 
 It was aggressive and terminal 
 ProtagonistA was given six months to live 
 And while ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's time was limited , ProtagonistA was determined to make the most of it 
 They were laughing and having a great time , but when they saw ProtagonistA they immediately stopped what they were doing and ran away 
 ProtagonistA was very hurt by this and ProtagonistA could n't understand why the children would be afraid of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the children were probably just afraid of strangers and that ProtagonistA should n't take it personally 
 ProtagonistA was relieved to hear this and ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's advice 
 The children started to look up to ProtagonistA and they admired ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's kind and caring nature 
 They would often tell their parents how lucky they were to have ProtagonistA as their neighbour 
 ProtagonistA 's coming ! I can hear ProtagonistA's footsteps in the hallway 
 I can see the light from ProtagonistA's lamp shining under the door 
 I 'm so excited ! I ca n't wait to see ProtagonistA ! 
 ProtagonistA felt the sharp sting of the blade as it pierced ProtagonistA's skin and then ProtagonistA was falling , the world going dark around ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA's aunt glared at ProtagonistA with a face that looked like it was on fire 
  ProtagonistA , I will not tolerate ProtagonistA's insolence any longer 
 ProtagonistA turned and walked to ProtagonistA's room , ProtagonistA's head held high 
 It felt like ProtagonistA was trapped in a nightmare with no way out 
 ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA onto the bird 's back and they flew away 
 ProtagonistB , however , just smiled and nodded encouragingly 
 This time , ProtagonistA's words came out more confidently 
 ProtagonistB nodded and smiled throughout ProtagonistA's speech 
 When ProtagonistA finished , ProtagonistB clapped ProtagonistB's hands and congratulated ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA had a bright future ahead of ProtagonistA and that ProtagonistA would be a great writer 
 The room was full of light , and the colors were so bright that they almost hurt ProtagonistA's eyes 
 There were people in the room , too , and they were all so beautiful that ProtagonistA could n't help but stare 
 Finally , ProtagonistB , came over to ProtagonistA and asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was doing there 
 No one knew where ProtagonistA came from or where ProtagonistA went to 
 The townsfolk were curious about ProtagonistA and followed ProtagonistA around , but they were always careful to keep their distance 
 It was the town hall 
 On the front of the building was a sign that read  Town Meeting 
 The town hall was empty , but ProtagonistA could hear voices coming from the room at the back 
 The townsfolk were gathered around a table , discussing something 
 Suddenly , the door opened and ProtagonistA was caught 
 The townsfolk were shocked to see ProtagonistA 
 They asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was doing there 
 The town 's sheriff took ProtagonistA to the jail 
 They put ProtagonistA in a cell and left ProtagonistA there 
 The townsfolk were afraid of ProtagonistA and did n't know what to do with ProtagonistA 
 We met at a party and we hit it off immediately 
 We were together for two years before ProtagonistA broke my heart and left me 
 I never saw ProtagonistA again , but I still think about ProtagonistA all the time 
ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the deep 
 It called to ProtagonistA in a way that the shallows never could 
 The further ProtagonistA went , the more the world around ProtagonistA changed 
 The colors became richer , the scents more intoxicating 
 It was the most beautiful place ProtagonistA had ever seen , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never want to leave 
 ProtagonistB was sitting on a throne , wearing a crown and a long , flowing gown 
 ProtagonistB had a stern look on ProtagonistB's face , but ProtagonistB's eyes were kind 
 Who are ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 I'm Alice ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 This is ProtagonistB's castle ,  ProtagonistB said 
 You must leave ,  ProtagonistB said 
  What 's wrong?There are dangerous creatures in these halls ,  ProtagonistB said 
On the night of the triumph of God , ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's womb , and bearing a son , John , uttered a pious prayer to St
 Fritigern , the King of Germany 
 ProtagonistA 's been there for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had a heart attack 
 ProtagonistB visits ProtagonistA every day , but today ProtagonistB 's not here 
  Hello , ProtagonistA 
 The woman is glowing and has a kind smile 
 I'm ProtagonistA's guardian angel ,  the woman replies 
  I 've been watching over ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's family for a long time 
 Of course ProtagonistA do , everyone does ,  the woman says 
  I 'm here to help ProtagonistA through this difficult time 
 ProtagonistB was a bit of a player and ProtagonistB immediately started hitting on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB did n't take no for an answer though , and ProtagonistB kept trying to convince ProtagonistA to sleep with ProtagonistB 
 Unfortunately , ProtagonistC did find out and ProtagonistC was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistC ended things with ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was left feeling regretful and alone 
 They started chatting and soon realized that they had a lot in common 
 They arranged to meet in person and they hit it off immediately 
It was a beautiful good day in October when ProtagonistA trod into the garden and saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was sitting on a bench , reading a book 
 ProtagonistB looked up when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA and smiled 
 Hello , ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 'm so glad ProtagonistB 're here 
 What about ?  ProtagonistB asked , closing ProtagonistB's book 
  ProtagonistA know ProtagonistA 've been distant lately and ProtagonistA 'm sorry 
 It 's okay , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said , getting up from the bench and giving ProtagonistA a hug 
  ProtagonistB understand 
 ProtagonistB 'm here for ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA need to talk 
 It was good to have ProtagonistB's support 
 ProtagonistA was sentenced to life in prison for a crime ProtagonistA did n't commit 
 ProtagonistA's family had disowned ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA had no friends left 
 The only thing that ProtagonistA has to keep ProtagonistA's company is the moon 
 The moon is ProtagonistA's friend 
 ProtagonistA talks to it every night 
 The moon is the only one who knows ProtagonistA 
 One night , ProtagonistA's parents go out to dinner and leave ProtagonistA's home alone 
  Hello , moon 
 ProtagonistA 'm so happy to see you tonight 
 ProtagonistB's name is Sarah 
 ProtagonistB 's in ProtagonistA's class at school 
 ProtagonistA really like ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA talks to it for hours 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA's parents come home 
 They see ProtagonistA sitting in the backyard , talking to the moon 
 They smile and shake their heads 
 They know that ProtagonistA is a special girl 
 They know that ProtagonistA is nothing without the moon 
In the year 1853 , the week under which ProtagonistA was born , ProtagonistB was induced to put a lock of ProtagonistA's hair on ProtagonistA's head 
 While ProtagonistC but little doubted that ProtagonistB was well acted , yet ProtagonistB found ProtagonistB plainly and unmistakably perceived to be interested in the matter , which , however , ProtagonistB had never before encountered in ProtagonistB's life , and which ProtagonistB had never dreamed of any way , before that time , having , in fact , no conception of the end or purpose of the conduct of ProtagonistB's affairs , been deceived into believing that they were spent , or that they were in proper hands 
 ProtagonistB had always been a dutiful sister , and when ProtagonistA was born ProtagonistB was happy to do anything that was asked of ProtagonistB 
 So when ProtagonistB was asked to put a lock of ProtagonistA's hair on ProtagonistA's head , ProtagonistB did n't hesitate 
 But as ProtagonistB did so , ProtagonistB realized that this was the first time ProtagonistB had ever been asked to do anything like this 
 ProtagonistB began to wonder what the purpose of it was 
 Was it just a harmless tradition , or was there something more to ProtagonistB could n't help but be interested in the matter , and ProtagonistB started to pay more attention to ProtagonistC's conduct 
 ProtagonistB began to suspect that there was more to it than meets the eye 
 As ProtagonistB continued to watch and learn , ProtagonistB gradually realized that ProtagonistC was not the person ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistC was 
 In fact , ProtagonistC was a fraud 
 ProtagonistB was shocked and horrified 
 ProtagonistB had been deceived into believing that ProtagonistC was a good and honest person , but ProtagonistC was actually a dishonest and manipulative woman 
 ProtagonistB was determined to expose ProtagonistC's true nature to the world 
 ProtagonistB went to the media and told them everything ProtagonistB knew 
 The story made headlines , and ProtagonistC was soon exposed as a fraud 
 ProtagonistB felt vindicated 
 ProtagonistB had been deceived , but ProtagonistB had also been brave enough to stand up and tell the truth 
 ProtagonistB had made a difference 
The first time ProtagonistA raised the dead was in a remarkably unscientific way , by which ProtagonistA meant by the ' oldest work of art of all the earth ' 
 At first , nothing happened 
 But then , to ProtagonistA's amazement , a figure began to take shape in the candlelight 
 It was the ghost of a young woman 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled 
 ProtagonistA had actually raised the dead ! The ghost spoke to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was able to ask it questions about the afterlife 
 The experience was life - changing , and ProtagonistA was hooked 
At the turn of the last century , when Europe was drifting apart , there lived ProtagonistA , and by the name of Caroline Caroline , or Caroline of Mary , ProtagonistA was called 
 ProtagonistA's father was a doctor and ProtagonistA's mother was a housewife 
 ProtagonistB was married and living in London 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistA to ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was an artist , and ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA quickly became friends 
 They would spend hours walking around London , talking and laughing 
 One day , ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA to marry ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistA said yes 
 They were married a few months later , and ProtagonistA moved into ProtagonistC's apartment 
 However , ProtagonistA's happiness was short - lived 
 ProtagonistC was a very jealous man , and ProtagonistC began to control ProtagonistA's every move 
 ProtagonistC did n't want ProtagonistA to leave the apartment , and ProtagonistC did n't want ProtagonistA to talk to anyone but ProtagonistC 
 However , the only reason ProtagonistA had never gone to college was that ProtagonistA did n't want to be thought of as dumb 
 One day , ProtagonistB , came to ProtagonistA with some news 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm going to college !  ProtagonistB exclaimed 
 That 's great ,  ProtagonistA said , trying to sound enthusiastic 
 Why did n't ProtagonistA ever go ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA sympathetically 
 ProtagonistA 're one of the smartest people ProtagonistB know 
 ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA would 've done great in college 
 ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistB's words 
 However , the pain only got worse and ProtagonistA began to feel dizzy and lightheaded 
 After a few tests , the doctors diagnosed ProtagonistA with a brain tumor and ProtagonistA was immediately admitted for surgery 
 Thankfully , the surgery was a success and ProtagonistA is now healthy and tumor - free 
There is no such thing as ProtagonistA , but there is a pricetag which is often a price - tag of the costume which ProtagonistA wears 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA is transported to a magical place 
 ProtagonistA's parents are very angry with ProtagonistA and they tell ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA must never leave the house again 
 It was a dragon 
 ProtagonistA read about a girl who lived in a different world , a world where there were no rules and ProtagonistB could do whatever ProtagonistB wanted 
 ProtagonistB was always happy and carefree , and ProtagonistA wanted to be just like ProtagonistB 
 The light had changed for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was never going to go back to the way things were before 
 The sun was up on this day , and the moon was bright 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 It led ProtagonistA to the back door 
 ProtagonistB was sitting in the middle of a big field 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB was lost 
 After a while , they came to a road 
 ProtagonistB pointed to a house down the road and said that was ProtagonistB's home 
 ProtagonistC came to the door and ProtagonistC was ProtagonistB's mother 
 ProtagonistC was so happy to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC thanked ProtagonistA for bringing ProtagonistB's home 
Figa and ProtagonistA's family were only two children , and they had fallen sick 
 With an acute hope of death , they were accompanied by great apprehensions 
ProtagonistA sulks and sinks back into the bible , ProtagonistA's silver eyes fixed on a section regarding birds 
 It was supposed to be a day of exploration and adventure with ProtagonistA's friends , but instead ProtagonistA was stuck here , in this stuffy old church 
 ProtagonistA had been dragged here by ProtagonistA's mother who said that ProtagonistA needed to  find ProtagonistA's faith 
 Suddenly , the door to the church opened and in walked ProtagonistA's friends 
 They had come to find ProtagonistA , there ProtagonistA are !  they exclaimed 
 We've been looking all over for ProtagonistA was so happy to see ProtagonistA's friends that ProtagonistA forgot all about ProtagonistA sulking 
 Together , they went on to have the best day ever 
 The painting is of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB's face hidden in the shadows 
 ProtagonistB is crying , ProtagonistB's tears falling into the darkness 
I see ProtagonistA's Rolls - Royce parked beside my school , said ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA's fancy - picture - tiles on the mantelpiece , and ProtagonistA's clapboard in the corner 
 ProtagonistB then went on to say that ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA at a party last weekend , and ProtagonistA looked happy and healthy 
 But one day , ProtagonistA was in a storm that was so bad , ProtagonistA's ship began to sink 
 But before ProtagonistA could get away , a huge wave came and partially drowned ProtagonistA 
 They were kind , intelligent and well - spoken 
 ProtagonistA felt very at ease with them and they soon became friends 
 ProtagonistB was especially friendly and ProtagonistA felt very drawn to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA's facial features , ProtagonistA's eye color , and ProtagonistA's body , said ProtagonistB , are all different 
 ProtagonistB was always pointing out how unique ProtagonistA was , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB for it 
 It was unlike any ProtagonistA had ever seen before 
 It had ProtagonistB's eyes 
 As soon as ProtagonistA did , the butterfly flew away 
 ProtagonistB had already bested ProtagonistA several times , but ProtagonistA was determined to win this time 
 The henchman grabbed ProtagonistA's cloak , causing ProtagonistA to lose ProtagonistA's grip on ProtagonistA's sword 
 ProtagonistB took advantage of the situation and knocked ProtagonistA to the ground 
 ProtagonistB was about to deliver the final blow when ProtagonistA's cloak suddenly came to life and wrapped itself around ProtagonistB's neck , choking ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB's henchman tried to pull the cloak off of ProtagonistB , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistB was already dead 
 With ProtagonistB gone , ProtagonistA's cloak released its grip and fell into the arms of the victor 
 ProtagonistB had followed ProtagonistA for days , waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike 
 When ProtagonistA finally stopped for gas , ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistB's chance 
 ProtagonistB slipped into the passenger seat of ProtagonistA's car and forced ProtagonistA to drive to a remote location 
 There , ProtagonistB raped ProtagonistA 
 Afterwards , ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA there to fend for ProtagonistA 
 I met ProtagonistB 
 I knew that ProtagonistB was the one for me 
 I proposed to ProtagonistB , and we were married 
 I am happy with ProtagonistB , and I know that ProtagonistA was wrong about me 
 ProtagonistB said it was for ProtagonistA 
 It even had the same type of paper in it 
 The words flowed easily and the story came together perfectly 
 ProtagonistA was finished in no time 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was doing in the turnip bush and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA was looking for ProtagonistA's lost cat 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA's cat earlier and offered to help ProtagonistA find it 
 They searched through the bush together , but they could n't find the cat 
 ProtagonistB carried ProtagonistA through the bush until they found ProtagonistA's cat 
 The sun was setting , and the sky was turning a beautiful shade of orange 
 This was ProtagonistA's chance to relax and just enjoy the moment 
ProtagonistA had a habit of making a speech with all the amazing clarity , propriety , and rationalism of a genius , and almost the same effect , when ProtagonistA had finished , as when ProtagonistA had finished ; for ProtagonistA was always going on about something , ever since ProtagonistA had heard it described to ProtagonistA 
 For instance , ProtagonistA would say ,  ProtagonistA do n't see how people can be so stupid ! ProtagonistA 'm sure if ProtagonistA were in their place ProtagonistA should be much wiser 
  ProtagonistA 'm sure ProtagonistA should have thought of a better way 
 ProtagonistA 's never been one for following the crowd or conforming to societal norms 
 ProtagonistB is a free spirit , just like ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB 's always up for a adventure and is always pushing boundaries 
 ProtagonistA 's finally found someone who accepts ProtagonistA for who ProtagonistA is and loves ProtagonistA for it 
 On their wedding day , ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA 's finally become the woman ProtagonistA 's always wanted to be 
They were sitting together on the leaden plank of the old boat , the aye , but not so long ago when the sailors were shivering in their hundreds , when the water was so deep that even the redskin boys were drowned in it ; when the sun was so low and the sky so black that the fires of the desert were almost out of breath , when the ship was so light that ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head in despair when ProtagonistA saw the captain in the middle of the night going beyond the windward deck , and instead of sinking , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA among the stars , drifting in space , with the power to move anything that ProtagonistA pleased in the universe 
 ProtagonistA 's been a fan of movies since ProtagonistA was a little girl , and ProtagonistA 's always loved going to the theatre to watch them 
 However , ProtagonistA 's never actually been to a movie theatre ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 's always wanted to , but ProtagonistA 's never had the chance 
 It was everything ProtagonistA 'd ever dreamed of 
 The big screen , the surround sound , the popcorn 
 However , the journey was not without incident 
 A large wave overturned the boat , and ProtagonistA was thrown into the water 
 ProtagonistA had been told that there was a place beyond the trees where the ground was made of something called  grass 
 In the center of the clearing was a large tree , and around the tree was a ring of smaller trees 
 It sounded like someone was coming 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA and smiled 
  Hi ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB's name is Sarah 
 What 's ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA forgot to answer 
 It 's okay ,  ProtagonistB said 
  There 's nothing to be afraid of 
 ProtagonistB wo n't hurt ProtagonistA 
 It 's nice to meet ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB know where that is ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Follow ProtagonistB 
 After a while , they came to a place where the trees stopped and the ground was covered in grass 
 This is it ,  ProtagonistB said 
  This is the place where the trees stop 
  This is the most beautiful place ProtagonistA 've ever seen 
In the beginning was a star , the same star which , in the beginning , ProtagonistA made , the shell of which ProtagonistA fashioned into four parts , the golden - headed , ProtagonistB , the bright - eyed , the yellow - eyed , and the red - eyed 
 All of these were beautiful , but the golden - headed was the most beautiful of all 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was out , the golden - headed went to ProtagonistB and said ,  I am the most beautiful of all 
 ProtagonistB should worship me 
  ProtagonistB replied ,  No , ProtagonistB am the most beautiful of all 
 You should worship ProtagonistB 
  This went on for some time , until the golden - headed got angry and said ,  If ProtagonistB do not worship me , I will kill ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB did not worship the golden - headed , so the golden - headed killed ProtagonistB 
 The same thing happened to the bright - eyed , the yellow - eyed , and the red - eyed 
 In the end , only the golden - headed remained 
 When ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's symptoms , ProtagonistB did a few tests and then sat ProtagonistA down to give ProtagonistA the news 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA needed to make some lifestyle changes and take medication for the rest of ProtagonistA's life 
 All ProtagonistA did all day was eat and sleep 
 One day , ProtagonistA's subjects came to ProtagonistA and said ,  ProtagonistA , we are very worried about ProtagonistA 
 We think ProtagonistA should see a doctor 
 The doctor examined ProtagonistA and said ,  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA are very old and very fat 
 I think ProtagonistA should diet and exercise 
 The moral of this story is that it 's never too late to start living a healthier life 
 It took ProtagonistA's years to find the entrance , but when ProtagonistA finally found it , ProtagonistA was not disappointed 
 The entrance to hell was a large cave that was filled with fire 
 ProtagonistA's father had planned to put ProtagonistA in the interests of peace , but ProtagonistA decided not to leave 
 But now , at the age of twenty - two , ProtagonistA was faced with an ultimatum : go it alone , or expose the real source of the calamity ProtagonistA was involved in 
 ProtagonistA was determined to find the truth , and ProtagonistA was not going to let anything stand in ProtagonistA's way 
 When a new serial killer begins targeting police officers , ProtagonistA is tasked with bringing them to justice 
I once had a story of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's parents were very proud of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was always the center of attention 
 The first thing ProtagonistA saw was a large caterpillar smoking a pipe 
 ProtagonistA's parents were very happy to see ProtagonistA , and they asked ProtagonistA to tell them all about ProtagonistA's adventure 
 ProtagonistA's parents were amazed , and they told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was a very special girl 
 They said that ProtagonistA could do anything ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to 
 It was a bestseller , and everyone loved it 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a dress that was too big for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's hair was cut short 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB's name was ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to follow ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA did 
 They fell in love and got married 
 They lived happily ever after 
 Sleeping was a bitch , ProtagonistA said , as ProtagonistA opened the door of ProtagonistA's old , badly needed and ragged cell 
 It was the summer solstice , and everyone was in a good mood 
 The sun was shining and the weather was perfect 
 Suddenly , someone mentioned the most northeasterly part of the state of Maine 
 ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the state of Maine , and ProtagonistA was curious to know more about its most northeasterly part 
 The person who was talking about it said that it was a beautiful place , and that the summer of 1763 was an especially good time to visit 
 ProtagonistA was intrigued , and ProtagonistA made a note to ProtagonistA to look into this place further 
 ProtagonistB was a big dog , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly 
 They would walk for hours together , and ProtagonistA would always make sure to bring ProtagonistB home safe and sound 
 ProtagonistB immediately ran to ProtagonistA's side , and stayed with ProtagonistA until help arrived 
They found ProtagonistA in a little room on the second floor of an apartment building , laying with ProtagonistA's eyes fixed upon a television screen , ProtagonistA's hands resting upon the table 
 It appeared as though ProtagonistA had been there for some time , as the food on the table was cold and the television was still on 
 They were n't sure what to do , but eventually they decided to call for help 
 The river was flowing swiftly and the water looked deep 
 But ProtagonistB did n't seem to hear ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB kept playing 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistB lost ProtagonistB's balance and fell into the river 
 The war had been raging for months , with no end in sight 
 ProtagonistA's family had been killed in a bombing , and ProtagonistA had barely escaped with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had been forced to flee ProtagonistA's home , with only the clothes on ProtagonistA's back and the memories of ProtagonistA's loved ones 
 It was a cold winter evening and ProtagonistA had just returned from a long day of work 
  Hello ?  said a voice on the other end 
  Is this the Smith residence ?  asked ProtagonistA 
  Yes , it is ,  said the voice 
  May ProtagonistA speak to ProtagonistB , please ?  asked ProtagonistA 
  I 'm sorry , but ProtagonistB is not available at the moment ,  said the voice 
  Can I take a message ?   Yes , please ,  said ProtagonistA 
  Could you tell ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA called and ProtagonistA is very sorry for the inconvenience , but ProtagonistA will call back tomorrow ?   I will certainly tell ProtagonistB ,  said the voice 
  Thank ProtagonistA for calling 
 However , the Living always seemed to find a way to beat ProtagonistA to it 
 They would always find a new place to live before ProtagonistA could even start the process of moving 
 It was frustrating , but ProtagonistA did n't let it get to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was determined to find a way to beat the Living 
 It was a name that held great weight and ProtagonistA knew the responsibility that came with it 
 ProtagonistA was being called upon to be the head of the family , the one who would lead them into the future 
 The sun had already set , and the moon was high in the sky 
 For ProtagonistA , there was no other place ProtagonistA would rather be than in the company of the Lord and His righteousness 
 And ProtagonistA was not alone in ProtagonistA's choice ; many others had also chosen the kingdom of Heaven as their final resting place 
 Together , they formed a community of the blessed , who enjoyed eternal peace and happiness in the presence of their Creator 
 ProtagonistA was always drawn to the water and loved to spend ProtagonistA's days swimming in the local pool 
 ProtagonistA's friends watched in horror as ProtagonistA drowned 
 ProtagonistA just kept walking , ProtagonistA's heart heavy in ProtagonistA's chest 
 Elizabeth , the wife of Mr
 Eliopolo , the Colonel of the Household at Court , and with whom ProtagonistA was always merry , and who was the cause of much expense to Carol 's owing to the imprudence of ProtagonistA , for ProtagonistA had never thought of it before 
 They all greeted ProtagonistA warmly , and ProtagonistA was happy to be in their midst once more 
 They chatted and laughed together , enjoying the fine day , until suddenly they heard a loud noise 
 They turned to see a large herd of stampeding horses coming towards them , kicking up a cloud of dust 
 ProtagonistA's father shouted for everyone to get to safety , but it was too late 
 The horses were upon them in an instant , trampling them underfoot 
 ProtagonistA was thrown from ProtagonistA's horse and hit ProtagonistA's head on a rock 
 The last thing ProtagonistA heard was ProtagonistB screaming for help 
 ProtagonistA was armed with a sword and shield , and ProtagonistA had the power of the elements at ProtagonistA's disposal 
In the year 1251 ProtagonistA loomed over London , and what was the matter with ProtagonistA ? No one could say for sure , but some speculated that ProtagonistA was a giantess 
 Others said ProtagonistA was a witch who had cast a spell on the city 
It was whispered in the city that ProtagonistA would tell you how it came to pass 
 ProtagonistB had a knife in ProtagonistB's hand and ProtagonistA was terrified 
 ProtagonistA was so shaken up that ProtagonistA decided to move to a different city 
 And that 's how ProtagonistA came to pass 
On a dark and stormy night in July , 1639 , the servant of the lord Bishop of York , who had been appointed by ProtagonistB to receive the precepts of the church , at Lambeth , in the kingdom of England , received an urgent and threatening communication in ProtagonistA's own chamber , which ProtagonistA took very seriously 
 It was from the hand of ProtagonistB , and it commanded ProtagonistA to appear before ProtagonistB at Lambeth Palace the next morning 
 ProtagonistA was met there by ProtagonistB's guard and taken to the royal presence 
 ProtagonistB was angry and demanded to know why ProtagonistA had not obeyed ProtagonistB's summons 
 ProtagonistB then ordered ProtagonistA to be taken to the Tower of London and imprisoned there 
After the war ended , a little more than a year earlier , we settled in a house in the district of St
 Peter 's , in which ProtagonistA had done the best ProtagonistA could 
 The house was small and cramped , but it was home 
 We were happy there , despite the circumstances 
 I agreed , and we began to make plans 
 A few months later , we were on our way 
 The move was not easy , but it was worth it 
ProtagonistA can remember the last time ProtagonistA had sex like it was yesterday 
 They were fooling around and things got a little too heated 
 ProtagonistA was n't ready to have sex and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB no , but ProtagonistB did n't listen 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA by force and ProtagonistA will never forget it 
 All men , of whatever sex , must die , but ProtagonistA will always remember the last time ProtagonistA had sex 
 It was the worst experience of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was called the Angel of Death , or rather the Angel of Death , because ProtagonistA had the audacity to become the Victim of a horrible and terrible crime , which is the least of all crimes 
 ProtagonistA was raped and murdered , and ProtagonistA's body was left in a ditch 
 The news of ProtagonistA's death shocked the world 
 How could ProtagonistA be killed so ProtagonistA's death sparked a worldwide movement to end violence against women 
 Millions of people marched in ProtagonistA's name , and ProtagonistA's story inspired others to speak out against their attackers 
 ProtagonistA's killers were eventually caught and brought to justice 
 But ProtagonistA's story continues to inspire people all over the world to stand up against violence and fight for justice 
 The Capitol was in a state of great disorder , and the new building was so ill - contrived that it was almost impossible to find one 's way about it 
 The floors were uneven , the walls were crooked , and the ceilings were so low that one could not stand upright in many of the rooms 
ProtagonistA's office was a small , well - furnished , and hot - air - conditioned room 
 The dozen men who turned into it were immediately struck by the heat 
 The men were all well - dressed , and they all looked to be in good health 
 The men all looked at each other , and then ProtagonistB spoke up 
 We're here to ask ProtagonistA for a favor , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  You see , we 're all in a bit of a predicament 
 It seems that they were all in need of money 
 They had all been frequenting the same ladies ' houses the summer before , and they had all run into a bit of bad luck 
 Now , they were all in need of a loan 
 The men were all very grateful , and they thanked ProtagonistA profusely 
 As they were leaving , one of the men turned to ProtagonistA and asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA had agreed to help them 
 The men all nodded their heads in agreement , and then they left 
ProtagonistA was born nine months after ProtagonistA's parents got married 
 ProtagonistB was thrilled to be a dad and doted on ProtagonistA every chance ProtagonistB got 
 ProtagonistC , was happy to have a child to raise , but ProtagonistC was also worried about how ProtagonistB would take care of ProtagonistA 
 After all , ProtagonistB was always working and did n't have much time for ProtagonistA 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was five years old , ProtagonistB came home from work and found ProtagonistC in the kitchen , crying 
 When ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistC what was wrong , ProtagonistC told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistC had been cheating on ProtagonistB and that ProtagonistA was n't ProtagonistB's daughter 
 ProtagonistB was devastated 
 ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA like ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's own , but now ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistA wasn't 
 ProtagonistB did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistB could n't tell ProtagonistC that ProtagonistB knew the truth , but ProtagonistB also could n't continue to pretend like everything was normal 
 In the end , ProtagonistB decided to move out and start a new life without ProtagonistA 
 It was the hardest thing ProtagonistB ever had to do , but ProtagonistB knew it was for the best 
 This time , it was closer 
 It was coming from below 
 It was a man 's voice , and it was coming from the other side of the door at the bottom of the stairs 
  Help me ,  the voice said 
  Please , help me 
 ProtagonistB caught up to ProtagonistA and grabbed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB dragged ProtagonistA into an alley and raped ProtagonistA 
 Afterwards , ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA there to die 
I have been listening to the last of the bishoprics and continuing to write to ProtagonistA , to inform ProtagonistA of my intention of moving to Canterbury - upon - Avon 
 I have been restless since my husband 's death and I feel that it is time for a change 
 I have been corresponding with ProtagonistA since ProtagonistA moved to Canterbury and ProtagonistA has been telling me all about the wonderful things to see and do there 
 I know that ProtagonistA will be happy to have me come and stay with ProtagonistA for a while 
 I am looking forward to exploring all that Canterbury has to offer and getting to know ProtagonistA better 
 The city was so big and so alive , and ProtagonistA felt so small and insignificant 
 Excuse ProtagonistA , do you suppose ProtagonistA would have leisure to think of what ProtagonistA would therefore do with the other men who sat around ProtagonistA , and had not a great many of them on the road?One of the men , who appeared to be the leader of the group , spoke up 
  We 're not sure what ProtagonistA 're talking about , but we do n't have any leisure time to think about what we would do with our lives 
 We 're just trying to survive 
 ProtagonistA was taken aback by their response 
 The dream that ProtagonistA would never take the risk of doing 
 The dream that would frighten ProtagonistA 
 The dream that would terrify ProtagonistA 
 The dream that would make ProtagonistA wish ProtagonistA had never done it 
 The ten - year - old boy who took an interest in everything ProtagonistA did was the one who convinced ProtagonistA to take the risk 
 The next thing ProtagonistA knew , ProtagonistA was being dragged along the bottom of the lake by the ice 
 The last thing ProtagonistA heard was the sound of the ice breaking open and ProtagonistA's own despairing howl 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA always wanted to know what was behind every door and what was inside every box 
 ProtagonistA's curiosity often got ProtagonistA into trouble , but ProtagonistA always managed to find ProtagonistA's way out again 
 It was a beautiful door with golden handles 
  Who is it ?  the voice asked 
  It 's me , Alice ,  ProtagonistA replied 
  ProtagonistA 'm curious about what 's behind this door 
  The voice on the other side of the door chuckled 
  I 'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA ca n't come in 
 This is the door to the forest and it is very dangerous 
  But ProtagonistA was not deterred 
 It took ProtagonistA a while , but eventually ProtagonistA managed to open the door 
 ProtagonistB did n't care about ProtagonistA's past or ProtagonistA's fears 
 ProtagonistB only cared about ProtagonistA's present and ProtagonistA's future 
 They were married and had a beautiful life together 
ProtagonistA's eyes were aflame with curiosity as ProtagonistA listened to the news 
 It was ProtagonistA's favorite place to play as a child 
 ProtagonistB told the story of the house , how it was built by ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC wanted to build ProtagonistD a house that would befit ProtagonistD's station , so ProtagonistC had the best architects and masons in the land build ProtagonistD a stone house 
 ProtagonistB told how ProtagonistD fell in love with a commoner , and how ProtagonistC was so enraged that ProtagonistC had the man killed 
 ProtagonistD was so heartbroken that ProtagonistD took ProtagonistD's own life 
 ProtagonistC was so distraught that ProtagonistC had the house torn down , and it was never rebuilt 
 ProtagonistB told how , centuries later , ProtagonistE had found the old foundation and decided to build a new house on it 
 ProtagonistE had no idea of the history of the house , but ProtagonistA now knew 
 ProtagonistB was supposed to help ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's purchase , but instead , ProtagonistB drove ProtagonistA into the blackness of ProtagonistA's apartment 
 The city was a refuge for those who wished to escape the anarchy that had swept the earth 
I remember as a child very well what it was like to grow up in a house with ProtagonistA , and the duty of having trouble with ProtagonistA 
 I would often find myself in ProtagonistA's way , and ProtagonistA would always be quick to tell me off 
 It was as if ProtagonistA enjoyed making me feel small and insignificant 
 I grew to resent ProtagonistA , and our relationship was always strained 
 I would often find ProtagonistA in a corner , rocking back and forth and muttering to ProtagonistA 
 It was heartbreaking to see ProtagonistA like that , and I wished that I could do something to help ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA's mental health took a turn for the worse and ProtagonistA ended up harming ProtagonistA 
 I found ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's room , covered in blood and I knew that I had to get help 
 I called an ambulance and ProtagonistA was taken to hospital 
 It was exhausting , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 ProtagonistB sniffed and wiped ProtagonistB's eyes before ProtagonistB started to speak 
  ProtagonistC are getting a divorce ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistC is moving away , and ProtagonistB 'm going to have to go with ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB do n't want to leave ProtagonistB's mom 
 ProtagonistB eventually stopped crying , and ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA talked for a while longer 
 ProtagonistB felt better knowing ProtagonistB was n't alone 
 ProtagonistA was reminded that even though ProtagonistA's own life was tough , there were others who were going through worse 
 ProtagonistA was known for ProtagonistA's profound knowledge of everything of which ProtagonistA was concerned 
 This included the fine arts of navigation , the principles of shipbuilding , and the use of explosives 
 ProtagonistA was also known for ProtagonistA's extensive labour 
 ProtagonistB had been a sailor for as long as ProtagonistB could remember , and the sea had always been ProtagonistB's home 
 But now , as ProtagonistB looked at the world above the waves , ProtagonistB felt like a stranger 
 ProtagonistB was n't sure who ProtagonistB was anymore , or what ProtagonistB's place in the world was 
 Was ProtagonistB still a sailor ? Or was ProtagonistB something more ? ProtagonistB was n't sure , but ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB had to find out 
 ProtagonistB demanded twenty - five dollars from ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA could hardly have imagined that ProtagonistA 'd be obliged to pay that load 
 ProtagonistB walked away , leaving ProtagonistA standing there , feeling angry and frustrated 
 The country was in the midst of a civil war , and ProtagonistA's home state of Virginia was on the side of the Confederacy 
 It was an afternoon of some utility , but it was also an afternoon of worry and distraction for ProtagonistA 
 I was so jealous 
 I wished I could be like ProtagonistA , carefree and happy 
 But I knew I could never be like that 
 I was too shy and too scared of what other people would think of me 
 So I just watched ProtagonistA from afar and envied ProtagonistA 
 The stranger was very friendly , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA enjoying the conversation 
 The stranger locked ProtagonistA in a room and told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA would never be found 
 But then , one day , the door to ProtagonistA's room opened and ProtagonistA was released 
 The stranger had been caught by the police , and ProtagonistA was finally free 
One morning , after the close of our first term , when the pain on my hand was beginning to subside , ProtagonistA issued a paper which ProtagonistA supposed to be a communication from ProtagonistB , for it bore the stamp of ProtagonistB's office , and was filled with the seal of the State 
 It ran as follows:The King of Hearts desires the pleasure of ProtagonistA's company at a Court Ball to be given this evening in honor of the visiting Princess of Hearts 
 They were both pleased , and ProtagonistA's father said ProtagonistA might go if ProtagonistA liked , but ProtagonistA must be back by midnight 
 ProtagonistA was ready long before the time , and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's parents set out for the palace in good spirits 
 On their arrival they were ushered into a magnificent hall , where the King and Queen and the Princess were already seated 
 ProtagonistB was very gracious to ProtagonistA , and asked ProtagonistA to dance with ProtagonistB ; and ProtagonistA did so , feeling quite proud and happy 
 At last the clocks struck twelve , and ProtagonistA was free to go 
 On one hand , ProtagonistB had just given ProtagonistA a raise and a promotion 
 On the other hand , ProtagonistA's best friend had just been diagnosed with cancer 
 ProtagonistA was so caught up in ProtagonistA's thoughts that ProtagonistA did n't hear ProtagonistB come up to ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA okay ?  ProtagonistB asked , concern etched on ProtagonistB's face 
  ProtagonistA 'm just happy and sad at the same time 
 ProtagonistA was loved by everyone , and ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA ever wanted 
 They got married and lived happily ever after 
 The hand looked small and delicate 
 But today , ProtagonistB was late 
  ProtagonistB 'm so sorry ,  ProtagonistB panted 
  ProtagonistB got held up at work 
It was not long before ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA was being mentioned in whispers of name and nationality 
 ProtagonistA was done with this small town and the people in it 
 Surely that would be enough to get ProtagonistA into heaven 
 There was no way into heaven that ProtagonistA could see 
 ProtagonistA ,  the voice said 
 But there is one more thing ProtagonistA must do before ProtagonistA can enter heaven 
 ProtagonistA must forgive ProtagonistA ,  the voice said 
 ProtagonistB was helpless , and ProtagonistA knew it 
 But then I saw the rise and fall of ProtagonistA's chest and I knew ProtagonistA was just asleep 
 I felt a sudden surge of relief and happiness 
 I did n't know who ProtagonistA was , but I knew that ProtagonistA was going to be okay 
ProtagonistB had ProtagonistA , and when ProtagonistA was five years old ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a name 
 ProtagonistB named ProtagonistA after ProtagonistB's mother , who had died when ProtagonistA was just a baby 
 However , ProtagonistA's happiness was short - lived 
 It was getting late , and the woods were starting to look a bit scary 
 It sounded like something was coming towards ProtagonistA 
 Suddenly , a large rabbit jumped out from the bushes and ran towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB caressed ProtagonistA's nose and said , with a smile over ProtagonistB's mouth ,  ProtagonistB do n't suppose ProtagonistA 's ever heard of the Luke the ProtagonistA was taken aback 
 ProtagonistA 'm a big fan 
 Church was pleased 
  ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA might be ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm a big fan of ProtagonistC ProtagonistB 
 In fact , ProtagonistB 'm writing a book about ProtagonistC 
 I'll make sure ProtagonistA get a copy ,  ProtagonistB said 
 And so began a beautiful friendship between ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB 
 They would spend hours talking about ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistA even helped ProtagonistB with ProtagonistB's book 
 It was published to great acclaim , and ProtagonistA was proud to have played a part in it 
 These were hard times , indeed , but ProtagonistA never gave up 
I remember when ProtagonistA added England to the list of places ProtagonistA visited 
 ProtagonistA never left England , thank heaven 
 England was ProtagonistA's favorite place to visit 
 But then , one winter , something changed 
 In ProtagonistA's nightmares , the snow was cold and unforgiving , burying people alive and turning them into ice sculptures 
 The snow became a symbol of ProtagonistA's fear , and ProtagonistA did everything ProtagonistA could to avoid it 
 And you know what ? It was n't so bad 
 The snow was cold , but it was n't scary 
 They were n't real 
 ProtagonistA was ejected from the car and killed instantly 
 ProtagonistA's last words were ,  ProtagonistA 'm free !  
 ProtagonistA was born with a gift -- the ability to see the future 
 Sure enough , just a few weeks later , ProtagonistA's vision came true 
 A massive earthquake struck ProtagonistA's hometown , killing hundreds of people 
 It was said that ProtagonistB had the power to control the weather and that ProtagonistB could make it rain or snow whenever ProtagonistB wanted 
 Some people even claimed that ProtagonistB could make the sun rise or set just by thinking about it 
 ProtagonistB had been sent to protect ProtagonistA from the demon that was trying to kill ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was supposed to use ProtagonistB's powers to help ProtagonistA defeat the demon and send it back to the underworld 
 After the battle was over , ProtagonistB had to return to ProtagonistB's own world 
ProtagonistB was the last man ProtagonistA saw before ProtagonistA left the East India ocean 
 ProtagonistB was a forgotten white - bearded beauty , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistC's day was coming 
 ProtagonistB did n't believe ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB did n't want to take any chances 
 ProtagonistB stayed up all night , watching the waves and waiting for ProtagonistC to come 
 But ProtagonistC never came 
 ProtagonistB was relieved , but ProtagonistB was also a little disappointed 
 ProtagonistB had never seen ProtagonistC before , and ProtagonistB was curious to know what ProtagonistC looked like 
ProtagonistA's godfather took ProtagonistA to see Mummy , ProtagonistB's sweetheart , ProtagonistB's sister , Mummy 
 It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever met ProtagonistA's extended family and ProtagonistA was excited to finally put faces to the names ProtagonistA had heard so much about 
 ProtagonistB was kind and loving , ProtagonistB's sweetheart was funny and charming , and ProtagonistB's sister was just like ProtagonistB in every way 
There was once , and there will always be one , Doctor LeDeux , a man who said ProtagonistA was going to be a god and that ProtagonistA was going to take over the universe and rule it and make the best of it 
 ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA , even when ProtagonistA did n't believe in ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB believed in ProtagonistA when no one else did 
 ProtagonistB saw this in ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB nurtured it 
 ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA to develop ProtagonistA's powers and to learn how to use them 
 ProtagonistA was destined to rule the universe 
 ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA , even when ProtagonistA did n't believe in ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB believed in ProtagonistA when no one else did 
 I cleared my throat to get ProtagonistA's attention and ProtagonistA turned around , looking startled 
  I introduced myself and ProtagonistA shook my hand , still looking a bit dazed 
  ProtagonistA 'm Alice 
 ProtagonistB's name was John , and ProtagonistB was a cruel and heartless ruler 
 The people of the kingdom were terrified of ProtagonistB , and they did everything ProtagonistB said 
 One day , ProtagonistB decided ProtagonistB wanted to marry ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was very happy , and ProtagonistB had a grand wedding 
 After the wedding , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB's bedchamber and raped ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB just kept going until ProtagonistB was finished 
 ProtagonistA was traumatized by the experience , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never be able to forget it 
 ProtagonistA was always impeccably dressed in the latest fashions and carried ProtagonistA with the air of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's features were sharp and angular , ProtagonistA's eyes piercing and cold 
 ProtagonistA was adopted 
 ProtagonistA's real parents had been killed in a car accident when ProtagonistA was just a baby 
 They had wanted ProtagonistA to have a better life than they had , and so they had given ProtagonistA everything they could 
 ProtagonistB was very handsome and had a kind heart 
 The two of them hit it off immediately and began to talk 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life and how ProtagonistB was the son of ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB also told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's love for nature and the outdoors 
 The two of them talked for hours , until finally , it was time for ProtagonistA to wake up 
 But one day ProtagonistB came to the village , and ProtagonistB had a name , and ProtagonistB was well known to nobody 
  And ProtagonistB said ,  That is a pity , for if ProtagonistA had a name ProtagonistA would be as well known as ProtagonistB am , and everybody would know ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA would be a good , honest boy in everything 
  And then ProtagonistB went away , and ProtagonistA was left in the village with no name 
When ProtagonistA had reached ProtagonistA's thirtieth year , the celebrated author works of M
 de la Tourgave presented themselves before ProtagonistA in extraordinary fashion 
 It was at a dinner party given by one of ProtagonistA's friends that ProtagonistA finally had the chance to speak with ProtagonistB 
 They struck up a conversation and discovered that they had a lot in common 
 Eventually , they began dating and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA falling in love with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 's been homeschooled ProtagonistA's whole life by ProtagonistA's parents , who are both geniuses themselves 
 ProtagonistA's parents are always telling ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA has the potential to be even greater than they are 
 ProtagonistA's parents have always pushed ProtagonistA to use ProtagonistA's talents to their fullest potential 
 They 've always told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA has the potential to change the world 
 And ProtagonistA 's determined to make ProtagonistA's parents proud 
 They would laugh and tell ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was too little to go fishing 
 But ProtagonistA was determined 
 ProtagonistA's parents were so proud of ProtagonistA 
 They had never seen anyone so determined to catch fish 
 They complained about the heat , the crowds , and the music 
 ProtagonistA was disappointed that ProtagonistA did n't get to enjoy the show , but ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA did n't have to deal with ProtagonistA's crew 's negativity 
 It was ProtagonistA's favorite place to clear ProtagonistA's head and think 
 Some of them ProtagonistA regretted , but most of them had led ProtagonistA to this happy place 
 A sign that everything was going to be alright 
 ProtagonistC , was a successful businessman , and ProtagonistA's mother , Martha , was a well - known socialite 
 ProtagonistC was very surprised when ProtagonistA told ProtagonistC ProtagonistA's plans 
 ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA wanted to go to Washington 
 ProtagonistC was not sure that it was a good idea for ProtagonistA to go to Washington 
 ProtagonistC was worried about ProtagonistA's safety 
 ProtagonistC finally agreed to let ProtagonistA go to Washington 
 ProtagonistC gave ProtagonistA some money for ProtagonistA's expenses 
 They were very proud of ProtagonistA 
 It is said that ProtagonistA had grown up to be a very rich man , although ProtagonistA could not certainly prove it 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to the village and asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA could help ProtagonistB find a lost dog 
 ProtagonistB was so grateful that ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a large bag of gold 
 Everyone in the village was very happy , and they all lived happily ever after 
 They had a very happy life together , and ProtagonistA was very proud of ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA's accomplishments 
 Unfortunately , their time together was cut short when ProtagonistA died suddenly of a heart attack 
 ProtagonistA was devastated , and ProtagonistA never really recovered from the loss 
 It was old and rusty , but it looked like it might still be usable 
 Suddenly , the cauldron began to boil and the feathers started to fly out of it 
 They were all very grateful to ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's kindness 
There was once ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was not called Jerome for nothing - for ProtagonistA was a loner , and a loner was never loved 
 Jerome was ProtagonistA's middle name , and ProtagonistA had always been a loner 
 However , there was one thing that ProtagonistA did yearn for , and that was love 
As the sun shone in the days that followed the death of the father , Robert Prynne , the death of once and a new father , the death of a sister and the death of a niece , and the marriage of a brother , and the death of a brother - in - law , there came into existence in Ireland of ProtagonistA 
 The people of Ireland loved ProtagonistA and welcomed ProtagonistA into their homes 
 ProtagonistA's presence made the world a better place 
 Sadly , ProtagonistA's time in Ireland came to an end 
 ProtagonistB was so fast that ProtagonistA could not catch ProtagonistB 
 The door was labeled  Do Not Enter 
  But ProtagonistA , being the curious girl that ProtagonistA was , ignored the warning and entered the door 
 The colors were so bright and the creatures were so strange 
 It was ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistB was telling ProtagonistA to come back , but ProtagonistA was having too much fun exploring 
 ProtagonistB warned ProtagonistA that if ProtagonistA did n't come back , ProtagonistA would be stuck in this place forever 
 And so , ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA is now stuck in that place , forever exploring and never able to leave 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB seemed to be in a hurry and ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA to a large door 
 ProtagonistB disappeared and ProtagonistA was left alone 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA it was time to go home 
I was born into an unforgiving world , a world where ProtagonistA's honour was worth the most trivial of things , such as the way ProtagonistA dressed , or the way ProtagonistA spoke , or how ProtagonistA acted toward women 
 I never understood why this was , but I knew that it was just the way things were 
 I grew up watching ProtagonistA be treated like a queen , while the rest of us were treated like dirt 
 It was n't fair , but I knew that there was nothing I could do about it 
 One day , I decided that I 'd had enough 
 I was going to stand up to ProtagonistA and show ProtagonistA that I was just as good as ProtagonistA was 
 I started by dressing like ProtagonistA , speaking like ProtagonistA , and acting like ProtagonistA 
 Eventually , my efforts paid off 
 It was a small victory , but it was enough for me 
 I had finally proven to myself that I was worthy of respect , and that was all that mattered 
  ProtagonistA 'm not sure what the future holds , but ProtagonistA 'm ready for whatever comes ProtagonistA's way 
 It had been a tough year for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 'd lost ProtagonistA's job , ProtagonistA's relationship had ended , and ProtagonistA 'd been diagnosed with cancer 
 ProtagonistA was confident and optimistic , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's best friend would be there for ProtagonistA , no matter what 
ProtagonistA was raised in a missionary family and was taught to help those in need 
 ProtagonistB was so grateful and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had been blessed with a special gift 
 The power to control death 
 As long as ProtagonistA had this power , the angel of death would have no control over ProtagonistA 
 That 's why ProtagonistA had to keep it a secret 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB could help ProtagonistA use it for good 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could trust ProtagonistB 
 Together , they began to use ProtagonistA's power to help others 
 To save lives 
 And as long as ProtagonistA had this power , the angel of death would have no power over ProtagonistA 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistA was found dead in ProtagonistA's home 
 The blood mourner thought that ProtagonistA had been already dead for some years 
Robert of Moray had been dying of a heart attack for some weeks before ProtagonistA's parents found ProtagonistA , in a pool underneath the stairs , still alive 
 When they did , they were both so relieved and happy that they wept with joy 
 It was a miracle , and they knew it 
The moment ProtagonistA appeared , all eyes in the garden were riveted on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was always surrounded by a group of adoring fans 
 The other girls in the garden were jealous of ProtagonistA 
 They wished they could be as popular as ProtagonistA was 
 They wished they could have all the attention that ProtagonistA got 
 But no matter how hard they tried , they could never be as popular as ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was sent to take a horse with ProtagonistA's officer , Lord Curzon , to the destination of a famous young man 
 ProtagonistA was tasked with finding out what the man was really like , and ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to discover his true character 
 They hit it off immediately and started dating 
 ProtagonistB was the first man ProtagonistA had ever met who made ProtagonistA feel truly happy 
 They got married a year later and lived happily ever after 
 The centurion said to ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA are a beautiful woman 
 I can tell that ProtagonistA are a kind and caring person 
 I am going to take ProtagonistA back to my camp so that ProtagonistA can be my queen 
 One day , the centurion said to ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA , I must go to battle 
 I will leave ProtagonistA here in my camp 
 I will leave ProtagonistB to watch over ProtagonistA 
 The centurion left and ProtagonistB took care of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was very kind to ProtagonistA and they soon fell in love 
ProtagonistA's parents had suspected all along that ProtagonistA had what was known as the infectious mind 
 They had seen the way ProtagonistA would light up a room with ProtagonistA's smile , and the way ProtagonistA would always be the first to start a conversation 
 They knew that ProtagonistA was special , and that ProtagonistA had the ability to make people feel good about themselves 
 They also knew that ProtagonistA was susceptible to getting caught up in ProtagonistA's own head , and that ProtagonistA could sometimes be a little too impulsive 
 But they loved ProtagonistA for all of ProtagonistA's quirks , and they knew that ProtagonistA was going to change the world 
 ProtagonistA was known for ProtagonistA's lively mind and ProtagonistA's ability to think outside the box 
 ProtagonistA was also known for ProtagonistA's kindness and ProtagonistA's willingness to help others 
 ProtagonistA's father was a successful businessman and ProtagonistA's mother a homemaker 
 However , when ProtagonistA was ten years old , ProtagonistA's world was turned upside down when ProtagonistA's parents were killed in a car accident 
 ProtagonistA was suddenly thrust into the role of head of the family , responsible for ProtagonistA's younger siblings 
 It was a daunting task , but ProtagonistA rose to the challenge and , with the help of ProtagonistA's extended family , ProtagonistA managed to keep the family together and make a success of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistB was a young woman , who had been stabbed to death in ProtagonistB's own home 
 ProtagonistA was shocked by the news and decided to find out more about the case 
 ProtagonistA was horrified by the story and decided to help the police with their investigation 
 There were creatures of all sorts scurrying around , and the air was thick with the smell of magic 
 One day , ProtagonistA's evil finally caught up with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was caught by the police for ProtagonistA's crimes 
 ProtagonistA was sentenced to death 
 ProtagonistA was executed by the electric chair 
ProtagonistA was not a sailor , for ProtagonistA had sailed south through a sea of ice and snow , and more than once had visited the tundra of Alaska 
 The captain of the boat agreed , and soon ProtagonistA was sailing south through the sea of ice and snow 
 It was said to be the most beautiful thing in the world , and ProtagonistA knew that it was true 
 It was even more beautiful than ProtagonistA had imagined 
 It 's beautiful , is n't ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB standing next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was also admiring the pyramid 
 They stood there together for a while , just looking at the pyramid 
 Then ProtagonistB spoke again 
 I'm sorry , ProtagonistB did n't mean to disturb ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB just wanted to share the moment with someone 
  ProtagonistA 'm glad ProtagonistB did 
 They stood there together for a while longer , enjoying the view 
 Then they went their separate ways 
 It was an unforgettable experience 
On the afternoon of the last Saturday of the month , February , 1882 , there was born to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was born at home in the front parlor , with the midwife in attendance 
 ProtagonistB was present for the birth of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB was filled with pride and joy at the sight of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was loved by ProtagonistA's family and friends , and ProtagonistA will be deeply missed by all who knew ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's husband had been married for years , but it was n't until recently that ProtagonistA realized how difficult the middle age can be 
 The middle age is the hardest age for any man , ProtagonistA said , and it 's only getting worse 
 ProtagonistA's husband agreed , and the two of them decided to divorce 
 They both agreed that it was for the best 
 ProtagonistA was welcomed there with open arms by the people 
 They were happy to have ProtagonistA as their leader and they looked up to ProtagonistA 
 They saw ProtagonistA as a wise and kind leader , and they were proud to call ProtagonistA their queen 
In the year 1252 , when the eastern wall of Constantinople began to give way , the Spaniard Iberico de Este , who , in spite of the worst hardships ProtagonistA had to endure , as a soldier of fortune , and in spite of the most abject conditions ProtagonistA had met in life , had made another discovery 
 ProtagonistB had found the secret entrance to the city 
 ProtagonistA had been reduced to living as a beggar in Constantinople , until ProtagonistB had taken ProtagonistA under ProtagonistB's wing 
 When ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about the secret entrance , ProtagonistA was thrilled 
 They made their way to the wall and ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA the hidden door 
 They slipped inside and began to make their way through the city , avoiding the guards 
 Eventually , they made it to the palace , where they found ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was being held captive by the Moors , and ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA were able to rescue ProtagonistC 
 From then on , ProtagonistA would be known as the Moor Slayer 
The flame of the fire should have been kindled as soon as ProtagonistA had walked all the way into the kitchen , when ProtagonistA was able to put ProtagonistA's legs through the doors and let the light burn on she 
 However , it took a few minutes for the light to catch and ProtagonistA began to feel the heat of the flames 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA dreamed of going on great adventures , of meeting new people and seeing new places 
 ProtagonistB was not paying attention to ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's opportunity 
 ProtagonistC is dirty and ProtagonistB 're not paying attention to ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB 're a disgrace 
  ProtagonistB was taken aback and started to apologize , but ProtagonistA was n't done 
  Hello , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 've been watching ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB know that ProtagonistA 're a special girl 
 ProtagonistB 'm here to offer ProtagonistA a deal 
  If ProtagonistA give ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's soul , ProtagonistB will make all of ProtagonistA's dreams come true 
  ProtagonistB made it sound so tempting , but ProtagonistA knew better 
  ProtagonistB was angry , but ProtagonistB knew there was nothing ProtagonistB could do 
 ProtagonistA was surrounded by ProtagonistA's friends and they were all having a great time 
 However , the fun came to a halt when ProtagonistB went into the room where ProtagonistA was having ProtagonistA's feast 
 Son of a whore ,  said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistB went into the very room where ProtagonistA had the feast 
 It hit ProtagonistB in the head and ProtagonistB fell to the ground 
 ProtagonistA's friends were horrified , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
ProtagonistA's life changed forever the day ProtagonistA stepped down from the roof of the Lancaster Moor house 
 ProtagonistA was told that ProtagonistA had suffered a concussion and was lucky to be alive 
 That fall changed ProtagonistA's life forever 
 It made ProtagonistA realize that ProtagonistA needed to make the most of ProtagonistA's life 
 It was a turning point in ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA will never forget it 
 ProtagonistB's name was Lloyd Lorenge and ProtagonistB looked to be no older than thirteen 
 ProtagonistB was standing in between ProtagonistA and the old building in which ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's office 
 ProtagonistB was looking down at the ground , as if ProtagonistB were lost in thought 
 ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with tears in ProtagonistB's eyes and said that ProtagonistB was lost 
 ProtagonistB's parents had died in a car accident and ProtagonistB was all alone in the world 
 ProtagonistA always wondered what happened to ProtagonistB and if ProtagonistB was doing okay 
First came the rumor that ProtagonistA had hired a team of assassins to kill the father of one of ProtagonistA's cousins 
 This caused quite a stir in the family , and everyone was on edge 
 Then , ProtagonistB , came forward and said that ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA arranging for a single assassin to do the work 
 This was the final straw , and ProtagonistA was immediately arrested 
 The court of coroner ruled that ProtagonistA was guilty of first degree murder , and ProtagonistA was sentenced to life in prison 
In the year 1447 , the year when Shakespeare became known throughout Europe , the world was in a state of great excitement , when a helian creature , or a celestial being , or one of the pre - existent things , known to men as angels , appeared to speak to ProtagonistA , and to tell ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was destined to be king ; and , further , that ProtagonistA would be the prince of heaven , or lord of heaven , or prince of the whole world , or emperor of the whole earth and the king of men ; and that all the rest of the world was bound to obey ProtagonistA , or else perish ; for , said the angel , I have made the establishment of the kingdom of heaven , or one of the things , for the 
A hundred years ago , in the year 1873 , ProtagonistB happened to meet ProtagonistA in the city of Detroit 
 They would often walk around the city together , exploring all the different shops and businesses 
 One day , while they were walking , they came across a beautiful dress in a shop window 
 After much pleading , ProtagonistB finally gave in and bought the dress for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was able to take the dress back to the store and exchange it for a smaller size 
 The girls continued to be friends for many years , until ProtagonistB moved away 
 They kept in touch through letters , and ProtagonistA always cherished the dress that ProtagonistB had bought for ProtagonistA 
In the year 1250 , the year of the Exodus , ProtagonistB appeared to ProtagonistA on Mount Sinai with a vision , telling ProtagonistA of ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistC would bring ProtagonistC's people to a new land , where they would be free from the tyranny of the Pharaohs 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to tell ProtagonistA's people to be ready , and to follow ProtagonistC when ProtagonistC came 
 ProtagonistA's parents were very supportive and took ProtagonistA to lessons every week 
 I never got to meet ProtagonistA , but my mom always told me stories about ProtagonistA 
 I like to think that ProtagonistA 's watching over me from heaven , and that 's why I always feel comforted when it rains 
 ProtagonistB was a good man , but ProtagonistB came from a poor family and did n't have much to offer ProtagonistA in terms of a future 
 ProtagonistA's family did everything they could to dissuade ProtagonistA from marrying ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was determined 
 The first few years were tough , as ProtagonistA's family continued to disapprove of ProtagonistA's choice and ProtagonistB struggled to find work that could support them 
 But they persevered and eventually found happiness together 
 They had two beautiful children and a life that , while not always easy , was filled with love 
There was a man in the country , near the village of Mistral , who was a farmer , very much concerned for the welfare of ProtagonistA's own family , and who had some of the best cattle and sheep in the country , and was very fond of ProtagonistA's poultry , and had a good deal of money in ProtagonistA's account , where ProtagonistA could always find a good price for them 
 One day , however , ProtagonistB found that ProtagonistB's cattle and sheep had all died , and ProtagonistB's poultry had all been stolen 
 ProtagonistB was very much distressed at this , and went to the village to ask ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA knew anything about it 
 I had been at ProtagonistA's bedside for hours , holding ProtagonistA's hand and telling ProtagonistA everything would be alright 
 But it was n't 
 ProtagonistA's injuries were too severe , and ProtagonistA passed away early that morning 
 I never got the chance to say goodbye 
ProtagonistA was born in 1246 in a small village in England 
 ProtagonistA's parents were farmers and ProtagonistA had a happy childhood 
 ProtagonistB was surprised , but ProtagonistB listened to ProtagonistA and promised to start giving ProtagonistA's project the attention it deserved 
 They had been living together for over a year , and ProtagonistA was fed up with ProtagonistC's messy habits 
 ProtagonistC was apologetic and promised to do better 
 They listened , and while they did n't necessarily agree with everything ProtagonistA said , they did start to treat ProtagonistA with more respect 
 It was the day ProtagonistA finally had the courage to speak ProtagonistA's mind , and it was the best day of ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA was born into a world of darkness 
 ProtagonistA was born into a world where ProtagonistA was the only one who could see the light 
 ProtagonistA was born into a world where ProtagonistA was the only one who could see the beauty 
 ProtagonistA was born into a world where ProtagonistA was the only one who could see the truth 
ProtagonistA's final report was a depressing one 
 Before any novel idea was entertained by any man , as to how to keep the record , ProtagonistA had already set the standard for how depressing a final report could be 
You 're going see ProtagonistA 
 There 's ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB 's got just as much money , and ProtagonistB 's got just as many guns , and ProtagonistB 's got just as many bombs 
 And ProtagonistB 's not afraid to use them 
 Sooner or later , there 's going to be a big showdown between the two of them , and it 's going to be a bloody one 
 The light was so bright against ProtagonistA's face that ProtagonistA had to squint ProtagonistA's eyes 
 It was a hot October day , and ProtagonistA was sweating in ProtagonistA's thick wool dress 
 ProtagonistB was tall and thin , with dark hair and piercing blue eyes 
 Could it be love ? 
 It is said that if ProtagonistA's body is discovered anywhere on earth , ProtagonistA will immediately reveal the nature of the crime ProtagonistA had committed 
 And then ProtagonistA was gone , leaving ProtagonistB alone in the water 
ProtagonistA's parents had always wanted a daughter 
 They had two sons , but they wanted a daughter to complete their family 
 When ProtagonistA came to live with them , they were overjoyed 
 The first thing ProtagonistA's parents said to ProtagonistA was ,  Welcome home , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB did n't know where ProtagonistA had gone , or why ProtagonistA had left 
 ProtagonistB missed ProtagonistA terribly , and ProtagonistB wondered if ProtagonistB would ever see ProtagonistA again 
 ProtagonistA's eyes were different , and ProtagonistA's hair was shorter 
 But despite all of these changes , ProtagonistB was still happy to see ProtagonistA 
 They hugged each other tightly , and they caught up on all that had happened in the years that they had been apart 
 ProtagonistB was amazed at all the stories that ProtagonistA had to tell , and ProtagonistB was happy that ProtagonistA had finally come back to ProtagonistB 
 And ProtagonistB was glad to have ProtagonistA back in ProtagonistB's life 
 ProtagonistA's paintings were unlike anything anyone had ever seen 
 They were full of life and color , and they told stories that ProtagonistA could tell 
 People were drawn to ProtagonistA's work , and ProtagonistA quickly gained a following 
 As ProtagonistA bent down to pick up a twig , ProtagonistA's fingers brushed against the earth , and ProtagonistA had an idea 
 It was unlike anything ProtagonistA had ever created , and ProtagonistA knew that it would make a lasting impression 
Dorman , a physician , lamented that ProtagonistA's profession had become so irrelevant , and had become so feeble and uncertain , that ProtagonistA no longer felt ProtagonistA bound to contact it with any amount of importance 
 They were no longer the lifesavers they once were 
 They were now just people who prescribed pills and gave advice that no one really listened to 
 ProtagonistA's husband , children , and grandchildren all loved ProtagonistA very much and did not want to see ProtagonistA go 
 The day finally came when ProtagonistA passed away 
 It was a peaceful death , and ProtagonistA was surrounded by ProtagonistA's loved ones 
 Even though ProtagonistA is gone , ProtagonistA will never be forgotten 
 In the end , their beautiful baby girl was born healthy and happy 
I have known ProtagonistA since ProtagonistA was little 
 ProtagonistA 's always been there for me , whether I needed a shoulder to cry on or someone to laugh with 
 I know I can always count on ProtagonistA 
 I 'm so proud of ProtagonistA and I know ProtagonistA 'll continue to make the world a better place 
 ProtagonistB was so struck by ProtagonistA's beauty that ProtagonistB immediately asked ProtagonistA to marry ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA joyfully accepted 
One afternoon , in the spring of an American year , when the sun filled and the clouds were blue , ProtagonistB hobbled ProtagonistA up the river , and pulled ProtagonistA out of the splashing rose - trees 
 ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA for some time , and had been struck by ProtagonistA's beauty 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA of ProtagonistB's life on the sea , and of the places ProtagonistB had seen 
 ProtagonistA was captivated by ProtagonistB's stories , and before long , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA agreeing to go with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to a small inn by the river , and they spent the afternoon talking and drinking wine 
 As the sun began to set , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to stay with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 's been through a lot of tough times , but ProtagonistA 's finally made it to ProtagonistA's goal 
 ProtagonistA 's accomplished everything ProtagonistA 's set out to do , and ProtagonistA 's done it with all ProtagonistA's might 
 It had been a long time since ProtagonistA had seen it , and ProtagonistA was not sure if ProtagonistA was ready to face it again 
 The plate was a reminder of ProtagonistA's past , and of the mistakes ProtagonistA had made 
 Otherwise , it would always haunt ProtagonistA 
It was a cold , wet , snow - packed February day in the last year of the reign of Henry III 
 , when ProtagonistA died of a fever that , for many years afterward , caused even the most shocked Christians to reckon ProtagonistA blessed 
 Though ProtagonistA was only seventeen , ProtagonistA had been married for two years , and ProtagonistB was already talking of starting a family 
 But ProtagonistA's death put a stop to those plans 
 For days after ProtagonistA's funeral , ProtagonistB could be seen wandering the streets of their small town , aimlessly kicking at the snow and muttering to ProtagonistB 
 Some said ProtagonistB went mad with grief ; others said ProtagonistB was simply cursed by God 
 But whatever the reason , ProtagonistB never recovered from ProtagonistA's death , and ProtagonistB died less than a year later 
ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by stories 
 ProtagonistB , had a way of making even the most mundane events sound like the most exciting adventure 
 ProtagonistB could make you believe that anything was possible , and that the world was a good place full of possibilities 
 ProtagonistA was captivated by ProtagonistB's stories , and ProtagonistA began to see the world in a new light 
 People were drawn to ProtagonistA's stories , and ProtagonistA quickly became known as a master storyteller in ProtagonistA's own right 
 It was the kind of pain that made ProtagonistA want to curl up in a ball and cry , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be strong 
 ProtagonistA's husband was out of work and ProtagonistA's children were still young 
 So , ProtagonistA grit ProtagonistA's teeth and bore the pain , even though every step felt like ProtagonistA was walking on hot coals 
 ProtagonistA's family had been told that ProtagonistA was unlikely to ever wake up 
 The first thing ProtagonistA did when ProtagonistA awoke was to abort the transplant 
 ProtagonistA could feel the foreign presence inside of ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get it out 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was missing something 
 The rabbit led ProtagonistA to a hole and ProtagonistA fell down it 
 The rabbit led ProtagonistA to a castle and ProtagonistA went inside 
 ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was looking for 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA would never find what ProtagonistA was looking for if ProtagonistA did n't know what it was 
 In the end , ProtagonistA's high moral character won out and ProtagonistA took the wallet to the police station , anonymously turning in the cash 
 The woman was kind and invited ProtagonistA inside 
 The officer told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA was in the middle of a city and ProtagonistA needed to find ProtagonistA's way out 
 They both sat in silence for a while , until ProtagonistB finally spoke up 
 What did ProtagonistA do ?  ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB nodded 
  ProtagonistB was at the park with ProtagonistB's friends when the police came and arrested us 
 They said we were causing a disturbance , but we were n't doing anything 
 As the sun began to rise , they both knew that they were going to have to face whatever was happening to them 
 It was , after all , something that ProtagonistA had always suspected 
 ProtagonistB was a kind and loving woman , but there was something about ProtagonistB that just seemed to cry out for romance 
 And now , it seemed , ProtagonistB had found it 
 ProtagonistA was prepared for the guards that would try to stop ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was not prepared for the sheer size of the building 
 It took ProtagonistA's hours to find ProtagonistA's way to the roof , and by the time ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA was exhausted 
 ProtagonistA placed the explosives and started the timer , then ran for ProtagonistA's life 
 The explosion was massive , and the entire building came crashing down 
It was on the first of May , in the year 1830 , that ProtagonistA , sitting in ProtagonistA's room at the Oxford , in the house of the Earl of Rosendoll , who was the proprietor of the most luxurious apartments in the city , and who , there being then no people of remarkable riches or distinction in the city , or of any rank whatever , and who were all struck with the envy and favor which prevailed there , exercised the following extraordinary and indeed a most singular power , for it was by means of a little device , employed in France about a hundred years ago , by the name of the trivalent motion or vital force , that ProtagonistA obtained from the presence of objects , either tangible or intangible , that most inconsiderable , and , indeed , that no one , or rather more than few , excepting the courtiers of the court and the nobles and the most important men of state , could possibly have imagined at the time , that any human being , who , such as Carol was , might have a reasonable opportunity of acquiring ProtagonistA's crown 
This is a tale about a man who was born on the Fourth of July , and who went through the Civil War , and who had a son who was killed in the war , and who , after the death of Alice , became the very object of love , or at least the object of much curiosity and much regret , and who , though never having been able to decide whether ProtagonistA was really Carol 's father or had in fact been married to either mother , still believed , with all the force of ProtagonistA's convictions , that ProtagonistA had been conceived in the womb of one of ProtagonistA's paternal grandparents , and that ProtagonistA had been in the process of becoming a man , in a state in which ProtagonistA had never been before , and in which ProtagonistA had never been very happy 
 ProtagonistA's mother was very excited to see ProtagonistA and had been counting down the days until ProtagonistA arrived 
 They hugged each other tightly when they finally met 
 They spent the day catching up on each other 's lives and talking about all the things they wanted to do together 
 To be a monster would mean to be feared and hated by everyone 
 To be nothing would mean to be invisible and unimportant 
On a near - perfect December day in the year 1757 , several hundred years after it had begun , a delegation of strangers landed in Amboise , at the entrance to the great promontory , where the Adroux ringed the top of the high peak , and the promontory with it ; and they were admitted by their hosts , Alice , but they only paid ProtagonistA so much attention , that ProtagonistA had only a vague idea of all the characters ProtagonistA was about to meet ; and , indeed , while ProtagonistA was treating them in this way,—and this author is of opinion that there was some truth in what ProtagonistA said,—they were not amused with ProtagonistA's insolent manner ; but , on the contrary , they were delighted with ProtagonistA's singularities of speech — such an art of speaking , in fact , that ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's voice ; it was already a source of amusement for the officers , and enabled them to strike a most interesting combination of tones — a very singular effect , in fact — and by a few degrees of improvement , the inmates of the gallery were very much amused , and , in consequence , were easily prevailed on to entertain and produce entertainments , of a like character , in the austere and rigid laws of the Colony 
 The word was ' expedition 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated by the idea of going on an expedition and started to daydream about what it would be like 
 ProtagonistB eyed ProtagonistA with a look of amusement 
  ProtagonistA are not what ProtagonistB expected ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB expected someone more 
 regal 
  And ProtagonistA 'm not here to impress ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 'm here to get something done 
  ProtagonistB leaned back in ProtagonistB's chair and regarded ProtagonistA for a moment 
  It 's a simple trade agreement 
 Nothing more , nothing less 
  ProtagonistB looked at the document , then back at ProtagonistA 
  It saves time 
  ProtagonistB signed the document , then pushed it back across the table to ProtagonistA 
  There ProtagonistA go ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB stared at ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA walked away , then shook ProtagonistB's head and went back to ProtagonistB's lunch 
 However , fate had other plans for ProtagonistA 
 They turned on ProtagonistA and would have killed ProtagonistA too if ProtagonistA had n't run away 
 ProtagonistA was terrified and ran as fast as ProtagonistA could 
 The men came into the cottage , but they could n't find ProtagonistA 
 They left , and ProtagonistA was safe 
ProtagonistA was never supposed to be alive 
 ProtagonistA was born premature and doctors said ProtagonistA would n't make it through the night 
 The doctors were amazed that ProtagonistA was alive and even more amazed that ProtagonistA was healthy 
 ProtagonistA did n't understand why ProtagonistB had to go and why ProtagonistB could n't take ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB 
 The first winter was the hardest 
 One day , ProtagonistC sat ProtagonistA down and explained that ProtagonistB was doing important work and that ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA very much 
 ProtagonistC also said that ProtagonistB would be back soon 
 said ProtagonistA , turning ProtagonistA's chair around to face the floor 
 It was ProtagonistA's own little space where ProtagonistA could be alone and think and read and write 
 It was perfect 
 But one day , everything changed 
 ProtagonistA's parents got a divorce , and ProtagonistA had to move in with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was always there , always making noise , always bothering ProtagonistA 
 It was torture 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had been praying for ProtagonistA , and that ProtagonistB believed ProtagonistA's innocence 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would do everything ProtagonistB could to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB's help was not enough , and ProtagonistA was executed 
 ProtagonistA thinks about ProtagonistA's life and how it 's been so good to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 's been blessed with a wonderful family , great friends , and a job that ProtagonistA loves 
ProtagonistA , sitting behind the cover of Rarity 's bedroom , ProtagonistA's eyes riveted on the wide - angled porthole , was thinking about the stories ProtagonistA 'd heard about the city , very similar to Boston 
 The sights , the sounds , the smells 
 it was all so new and exciting 
 They had been on a hike , and ProtagonistA had wandered off the trail 
 When ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's way back , they were gone 
 There was a oasis , and ProtagonistA ran to it 
 The rabbit saw ProtagonistA and froze , its eyes wide in fear 
 The stars were shining so brightly and the moon was so big 
 The two possible outcomes had played out in ProtagonistA's head so many times that ProtagonistA was exhausted 
 It was time to get moving again 
 ProtagonistA was getting a bit tired from all the running around ProtagonistA had been doing lately 
 It seemed like every day there was something new to explore and ProtagonistA just could n't keep up 
 But ProtagonistB had led ProtagonistA deeper and deeper into the forest , until ProtagonistA was completely lost 
 ProtagonistB beckoned ProtagonistA to follow ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA out of the forest and back to ProtagonistA's home 
 They were all amazed and wanted to know how ProtagonistA had seen it 
 It was a peaceful scene , but something was wrong 
 It was as if the life had been sucked out of the village 
 They did n't even seem to notice ProtagonistA 
 It was as if they had given up hope 
 Slowly , but surely , the village began to come back to life 
 The people became more active and engaged 
 They began to take pride in their homes and their community 
 And that was the most important thing of all 
 ProtagonistA was jolted awake by the sound of the barn door opening 
 There was no answer 
 ProtagonistA's heart was pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
 ProtagonistA was terrified 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was relieved 
 It was ProtagonistB 
  What are ProtagonistB doing here?I came to check on ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA go into the cooler , and ProtagonistB was worried about ProtagonistA 
  Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA 'm fine 
 Okay ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'll let ProtagonistA get back to ProtagonistA's nap then 
 ProtagonistB said yes , so ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistB was amazed and said they were the most beautiful feet ProtagonistB had ever seen 
ProtagonistA was getting frustrated 
 ProtagonistA had been trying to get ProtagonistA's stork to fly for hours now and it just was n't working 
  Now , now , all right ?  said ProtagonistA , shaking ProtagonistA's stork 
  You have to fly 
  But the stork just looked at ProtagonistA , not moving a muscle 
  It was the stork speaking to ProtagonistA 
  But ProtagonistA do believe ,  said ProtagonistA 
   That 's the thing , ProtagonistA ,  said the stork 
 Once ProtagonistA do that , the rest will be easy 
  With that , the stork took off into the sky , leaving ProtagonistA behind 
 But ProtagonistA was determined 
One day ProtagonistA's father sent ProtagonistA to live with ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle 
 They did n't allow ProtagonistA to do anything fun 
 ProtagonistA was shocked and hurt 
 When ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistB denied it at first 
 But eventually ProtagonistB confessed 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB was sorry and that ProtagonistB did n't know why ProtagonistB did it 
 It was perfect 
 However , they knew that one day ProtagonistA would grow up and leave them 
 They did n't want ProtagonistA to go , but they knew ProtagonistA had to 
 They were heartbroken , but they knew it was for the best 
 They hugged ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA how much they loved ProtagonistA 
 They also told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA would always be a part of their family , no matter what 
 The only light came from a glowing orb that floated above ProtagonistA's head , and ProtagonistA was getting very tired 
 They were coming from ahead of ProtagonistA , and they sounded like they were arguing 
 They were both about the same size as ProtagonistA , and they had long ears and furry tails 
 The creatures were arguing about something , and ProtagonistA could n't understand what they were saying 
 It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining down on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approach 
 ProtagonistA ?  a voice said 
 I was just wondering what ProtagonistA were thinking about ,  ProtagonistB said 
  It 's so beautiful out here 
 Yes , it is ,  ProtagonistB said , coming to sit beside ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB 'm glad ProtagonistA 're enjoying it 
 They sat there together , enjoying the peace and quiet of the day 
 The noise of the guns and the screams of the wounded echoed in ProtagonistA's ears , and the smoke from the fires burned ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistB came into the room and stared at ProtagonistA , a cruel smile on ProtagonistB's face 
  ProtagonistB see ProtagonistA 're still here ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm sorry to say that ProtagonistA's rescue is not coming 
 No one knows ProtagonistA 're here , and no one ever will 
 ProtagonistB came closer to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA backed away until ProtagonistA was against the wall 
 ProtagonistB grabbed ProtagonistA by the throat and started to choke ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was transfixed by the story of Alice 's adventures in Wonderland 
 It was a beautiful night , and ProtagonistA felt so lucky to be alive 
 ProtagonistA was exhausted from a long day of work and just wanted to relax 
It was that rainy morning in July , that ProtagonistA was watching over ProtagonistA's new house 
 ProtagonistB came up to the house and knocked on the door 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB was moving into the house next door , and ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA moving in and wanted to welcome ProtagonistA to the neighborhood 
 They talked for a while , and ProtagonistA invited ProtagonistB in for some coffee 
 They became friends , and ProtagonistA was glad to have a neighbor ProtagonistA could talk to 
 It was a beautiful portrait of ProtagonistA's cat , Snickers 
 It was simple , but it was also elegant , and it would showcase ProtagonistA's cat 's portrait perfectly 
 Tonight was no different 
 Maybe the moon was just taking a break 
 But it was gone 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was inside ProtagonistA's house 
  ProtagonistB 've come for the moon ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB know ProtagonistA have it 
 Give it to ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistA was confused 
 But before ProtagonistA could say anything , ProtagonistB had pulled out a gun and pointed it at ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB do n't want to hurt ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Just give ProtagonistB the moon 
 It was the sound of someone moving around 
 ProtagonistB heard it too 
 ProtagonistB turned and ran out of the house 
 Snuggles , sleeping on ProtagonistA's bed 
ProtagonistB was a beautiful mare , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly 
 However , one day , while they were out grazing in the pasture , ProtagonistB suddenly began to spin in circles , ProtagonistB's eyes wide in alarm 
 ProtagonistB's hooves shook in the darkness , and ProtagonistA knew something was wrong 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB collapsed , and ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB was dead 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 It was a day that changed ProtagonistA's life forever 
 ProtagonistB stammered and said ,  ProtagonistA look 
 different 
 At the end of the date , ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB had a great time , but ProtagonistB think ProtagonistB 'm going to need some time to get used to ProtagonistA's new look 
 In ProtagonistA's opinion , it was filled with the most beautiful white foals 
 It was a peaceful moment , one that ProtagonistA cherished 
 The drink was a bright pink and tasted like strawberries 
 It was ProtagonistA's new favorite and ProtagonistA loved it 
 ProtagonistB stopped and looked at ProtagonistA 
 Are ProtagonistA feeling alright ?  ProtagonistB asked 
  ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head and said ,  ProtagonistA should lay off the alcohol 
 It 's not good for ProtagonistA 
  And with that , ProtagonistB walked away 
For as long as ProtagonistA could remember , ProtagonistB had been the only person ProtagonistA knew who had ever understood ProtagonistA's whole personality better 
 Even when ProtagonistA was a little girl and would get upset about something , ProtagonistB would always know how to make ProtagonistA feel better 
 ProtagonistB was the one person ProtagonistA could always count on , no matter what 
 So when ProtagonistB passed away suddenly , ProtagonistA was absolutely devastated 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to get through it 
 ProtagonistA's sister had been pacing the downstairs hallway for hours , still staring up at the giant dragon sitting on the doorstep 
 ProtagonistA was determined to figure out how to get rid of the dragon 
 The dragon sniffed the cupcake and then ate it in one bite 
 Then it licked its lips and seemed to smile 
 After that , the dragon went away and ProtagonistA was able to go back to ProtagonistA's normal life 
 They became friends and started dating 
 They got married a few years later and had two kids 
 They were happy together until ProtagonistB died of a heart attack 
 ProtagonistA was left to raise their kids on ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA was rewarded for ProtagonistA's patience when ProtagonistA's sister finally arrived 
  I 'm so sorry it took me so long ,  ProtagonistA's sister said 
  I got lost a few times 
  ProtagonistA 'm just glad you made it 
  The sisters hugged each other tightly , enjoying the view from the top of the mountain 
 ProtagonistA was too keyed up to sit still 
 The door opened and ProtagonistB walked in 
 ProtagonistB was just as ProtagonistA remembered ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a simple dress and ProtagonistB's hair was pulled back in a loose ponytail 
 ProtagonistB looked tired , but ProtagonistB's eyes lit up when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA 
 Rainbow Dash ! ProtagonistB ca n't believe ProtagonistA 're here !  ProtagonistB exclaimed 
 What 's wrong ?  ProtagonistB asked , concern creasing ProtagonistB's brow 
 It 's ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC 's in trouble and ProtagonistA do n't know how to help ProtagonistC 
 Of course , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB 'll do whatever ProtagonistB can 
 ProtagonistB sat down and listened as ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistC's problems 
 ProtagonistA was relieved when ProtagonistB offered to help 
 Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB 
 It 's no problem , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB 'm happy to help 
 Now , let 's see what we can do for ProtagonistC 
 The pony was white with a black mane and tail , and it was looking at ProtagonistA with its big , brown eyes 
 Then the pony spoke to ProtagonistA 
  Hello , ProtagonistA 
 I 'm here to take ProtagonistA on an adventure 
 They went on a magical journey through the woods and came to a beautiful castle 
 The pony turned to ProtagonistA and said ,  This is ProtagonistA's adventure , ProtagonistA 
 It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining down through the leaves , making them glow in a million different shades of green 
 It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining down on the peaceful scene 
 The second thing ProtagonistA noticed was the car idling next to ProtagonistB with the driver 's side door open 
 ProtagonistB , surprised at first , followed suit 
 They sped off into the night , not knowing where they were going or what they were doing , but knowing that they had to get as far away from that church as possible 
 It had been years since they had last seen each other and ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistB would even remember ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB and they ran to each other and hugged 
 They both started crying and they promised to never lose touch again 
ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , it felt like days 
 ProtagonistA was so thirsty ProtagonistA's throat felt like it was on fire , and ProtagonistA's stomach was so empty it was cramping 
 The sound of the moon was quiet and the only thing bothering ProtagonistA was that the air was slightly too cold for ProtagonistA liking 
 It sounded like running water 
 Then everything went black 
 That changed when ProtagonistA was attacked one night while walking home from work 
 ProtagonistB came out of the shadows and grabbed ProtagonistA , holding a knife to ProtagonistA's throat 
 ProtagonistA was terrified 
 But then , something inside ProtagonistA snapped 
 ProtagonistB fell to the ground , clutching ProtagonistB's wound and groaning in pain 
 ProtagonistA was still getting used to ProtagonistA's new life , but ProtagonistA loved it 
 Rowling 
 It was about being content with what you had 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB had a package for ProtagonistA 
 They were ProtagonistA's favorite 
 It would be fine 
  Is this ProtagonistA ?  the voice on the other end said 
  I 'm sorry to tell you this , but ProtagonistB was in a car accident 
 ProtagonistB did n't make it 
 This was ProtagonistA's worst nightmare come true 
 They had said that if you imagine yourself as your true form , you will change back 
  Hello there ,  the voice said 
  It looks like ProtagonistA 're having some trouble 
  ProtagonistB wo n't move 
 Let ProtagonistC take a look ,  ProtagonistC said 
 ProtagonistC walked over and placed ProtagonistC's hand on ProtagonistB's head 
 After a few moments , ProtagonistB started moving again 
 There ProtagonistA go ,  ProtagonistC said 
  Just give ProtagonistB a little encouragement and ProtagonistB 'll be fine 
 But death did n't come 
 The pills did n't work 
Once upon a time , there was a land called Twilight 
 It was a magical place where ProtagonistA lived and laughed ProtagonistA's butt off 
 ProtagonistB was so handsome and charming that ProtagonistA fell in love with ProtagonistB instantly 
 They got married and had a beautiful baby girl 
 They lived happily ever after 
 ProtagonistA , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  asked a voice 
 But why are ProtagonistA sitting like that ?  asked the squirrel 
 It 's comfortable ,  said ProtagonistA 
 But it looks so strange ,  said the bird 
 The sun began to rise , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA at the edge of a beautiful forest 
 In the center of the clearing was a beautiful tree , and sitting in the tree was ProtagonistA's mother 
 ProtagonistA's mother smiled and beckoned ProtagonistA closer 
 ProtagonistA was exhausted from a long day of work and just wanted to relax 
 ProtagonistA was done reliving the past 
 ProtagonistB was a kind and honest person , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could always count on ProtagonistB to tell the truth 
It was a warm afternoon in April , the watch of the royal court being to witness the first trial of ProtagonistA 
 The King , Queen , and all the courtiers were in attendance , seated in the grand hall of the palace 
 ProtagonistA was brought in , ProtagonistA's hands bound in front of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was accused of conspiring with ProtagonistA's brother to overthrow the King and take the throne for themselves 
 The court found ProtagonistA guilty and ProtagonistA was sentenced to death 
 ProtagonistB was the most beautiful horse ProtagonistA had ever seen , with a long , flowing mane and tail and a coat that shone in the sun 
 ProtagonistA was determined to buy ProtagonistB , no matter what the cost 
 The opportunity finally came one day when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB in the field behind ProtagonistA's house 
 ProtagonistB seemed startled at first , but ProtagonistA quickly won ProtagonistB over with a few kind words and a treat 
 In the end , ProtagonistB agreed and ProtagonistA rode off with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was getting a little bit tired from all the walking ProtagonistA had been doing lately 
 It was hard to believe that it had been almost a year since ProtagonistA had first set out on ProtagonistA's journey 
 It was a voice ProtagonistA recognized immediately 
 It was ProtagonistA's friend , the White Rabbit 
 ProtagonistA , where are ProtagonistA going ?  the Rabbit asked 
 Oh , ProtagonistA must come with me ,  the Rabbit said 
  I 'm just on my way there myself 
 I can show ProtagonistA the way 
 Soon , they came to a huge gate 
 This is it ,  the Rabbit said 
  Welcome to the city 
 The city was even more beautiful than ProtagonistA had imagined 
 The white sapland was a place of peace , a place where people went to find themselves 
ProtagonistB had been out fishing all day , and ProtagonistA had been eagerly awaiting ProtagonistB's return 
 But when the doorbell rang , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistB had just drowned 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 It was a cold night , and ProtagonistB's moon was particularly bright 
 But ProtagonistB was too quick 
 ProtagonistB dodged the net and flew off into the night , leaving ProtagonistA empty - handed 
The last full moon of the sultry afternoons of January and February was the last time that the air was clear and ProtagonistA shone pale and clear across the land 
 Now , the sun was setting and ProtagonistA was starting to get scared 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB had been looking for ProtagonistA too 
 They were both relieved and happy to be reunited 
 They walked back to the river to find the others and continued playing until it was time to go home 
 At first ProtagonistA had been scared to go inside , but ProtagonistA was so desperate that ProtagonistA had decided to take the risk 
 There was no one home , and it looked like it had been abandoned for years 
 ProtagonistB was very beautiful , with long blonde hair and blue eyes 
 ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA's daughter , and ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had come to visit ProtagonistA 
 They hugged each other and then sat down to talk 
 They talked for a long time , and it was a very happy visit 
The first time ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA , when ProtagonistA had been a boy called Spike , ProtagonistB had been struck by ProtagonistA's beauty 
 ProtagonistA was unlike any other girl ProtagonistB had ever seen 
 ProtagonistB had been instantly smitten 
 ProtagonistB had tried to talk to ProtagonistA on several occasions , but ProtagonistA had always seemed nervous and shy around ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB had been about to give up hope when , one day , ProtagonistA had finally spoken to ProtagonistB 
 They had struck up a conversation and ProtagonistB had found out that ProtagonistA was interested in the same things as ProtagonistB 
 They had become friends quickly and ProtagonistB had started to develop deeper feelings for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been planning to tell ProtagonistA how ProtagonistB felt , but before ProtagonistB could , ProtagonistA had started dating someone else 
 ProtagonistB had been heartbroken , but had tried to hide it 
 ProtagonistB had continued to be friends with ProtagonistA , even though it had been difficult 
 ProtagonistB had been happy for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA had got married and had children , even though it had made ProtagonistB feel even more alone 
 Now , many years later , ProtagonistB was still single and ProtagonistA was divorced 
 They had both come to the same party and , for the first time in years , ProtagonistB had felt that old spark of attraction 
 They had spent the night talking and laughing and ProtagonistB had felt like ProtagonistB was finally home 
ProtagonistA was called Astrid , and ProtagonistA was a little girl , and ProtagonistA had a stick and a torch , and ProtagonistA used to dream of a land where ProtagonistA might live happily ever after with ProtagonistA's loving husband and beautiful little daughter and little son 
 It was time to get moving 
 It was taken when ProtagonistA was just a foal , and ProtagonistA's mother and father were both alive 
 They had all been laughing and joking , and ProtagonistA's mother had been so happy 
 Now , ProtagonistA's mother was gone , and ProtagonistB was barely hanging on 
 The cancer had taken so much from ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was weak enough as it was 
 Oh yeah , oh yeah , just twenty - one minutes long 
 Well 
 That means just eighteen minutes 
 But that does n't matter , because on top of that ProtagonistA was already coming up with a whole bunch of ways to torture me 
 Eventually , the cupcakes started showing up in places where I would never expect to find them 
 Like in my cereal box , or in my toothbrush holder 
 I was getting sick of finding cupcakes everywhere , and I told ProtagonistA so 
 I was being ridiculous 
 Eventually , the cupcake prank war died down and we went back to eating them together like we used to 
 But every time I see a cupcake now , I ca n't help but think of all the creative ways ProtagonistA came up with to torture me 
 It was the house ProtagonistA had grown up in , and the house ProtagonistA would always think of as home 
 Peter 's 
 ProtagonistA was admitted into the good order of the church only by consent of the vicar , but who at Alice 's death had been faithful to it ever since 
 It was a clear night , and the stars were shining bright , but ProtagonistA just could n't enjoy them 
 ProtagonistB had been acting strange lately 
 ProtagonistB was always either moping around or getting angry for no reason 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear ProtagonistB come into the room 
 ProtagonistB ! What are ProtagonistB doing ProtagonistB just stared at ProtagonistA for a moment before ProtagonistB finally spoke 
  ProtagonistB could n't sleep , so ProtagonistB came to look at the stars 
 But now ProtagonistB see that ProtagonistA 're here too 
 What about ProtagonistA was just worried about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB 've been acting really strange lately 
 ProtagonistB sighed and sat down on the bed 
  ProtagonistB know 
 ProtagonistB do n't know what 's wrong with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB just feel really lost right now 
 Rainbow Dash sat down next to ProtagonistB and put a comforting wing around ProtagonistB 
  It 's okay , ProtagonistB 
 We 'll figure it out together 
 It was a beautiful book , with intricate illustrations and a fascinating story , but ProtagonistA's life was so busy that ProtagonistA never seemed to have any time to read it 
 The cage was dark , and there was no way for ProtagonistA to see outside 
Three years ago M
 ProtagonistA's mother had been killed in the fire , and ProtagonistA was the only one who had survived 
It was the day ProtagonistA's sister , Applejack , died , yet ProtagonistA was feeling very much alive 
 But , ProtagonistA was determined to live ProtagonistA's life to the fullest and make ProtagonistA's sister proud 
 It was as if ProtagonistA's sister was right there with ProtagonistA , living life to the fullest 
 But ProtagonistA's beauty was not to last 
 A wicked witch cursed ProtagonistA , turning ProtagonistA into a hideous beast 
 ProtagonistA was locked away in a tower , hidden from the world 
 The only company ProtagonistA had was the witch , who taunted ProtagonistA and made ProtagonistA's life a living hell 
 The witch was never seen again , and ProtagonistA lived happily ever after 
 The estate had been in ProtagonistA's family for generations and ProtagonistA was the last living member 
 ProtagonistA's mind wandered as ProtagonistA rocked back and forth , thinking of all the happy times ProtagonistA had experienced in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistA's late husband , whom ProtagonistA had loved dearly , and of their happy life together 
 ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistA's children and grandchildren , and how much ProtagonistA loved them all 
 They were all carrying bags and boxes and looked to be in a hurry 
 They were ProtagonistA's heart skipped a beat as ProtagonistA realized what was happening 
 The soldiers were coming to take over the ProtagonistA quickly ran inside the house and locked the door 
ProtagonistA's skirt was almost completely around ProtagonistA's ankles , but ProtagonistA 'd told me that ProtagonistA would n't have mercy on ProtagonistA 
 I was trying my best to keep up , but ProtagonistA's pace was too fast for me 
 I admired ProtagonistA's determination , but I wished ProtagonistA would slow down sometimes 
 We were out on a run , just like we did every morning 
 It was our time to clear our heads and get in a good workout 
 ProtagonistA was running faster than usual and I was struggling to keep up 
 Finally , I could n't take it anymore 
 I had to stop and catch my breath 
 I watched ProtagonistA disappear into the distance , ProtagonistA's skirt flapping in the wind 
 I was about to give up and walk back home , when I heard ProtagonistA's voice in my head 
  Do n't give up on yourself , you can do it!Her words gave me strength and I started running again 
 I caught up to ProtagonistA and we finished our run together 
 I was exhausted , but I felt good 
 I was proud of myself for not giving up 
 Thanks to ProtagonistA , I had learned that I was capable of more than I thought 
 I was grateful to have ProtagonistA in my life , even if ProtagonistA did make me work hard 
ProtagonistA burst through the door to ProtagonistB's room , screaming ,  What 's happened ?  ProtagonistB was sitting on ProtagonistB's bed , looking pale and shaken 
  ProtagonistB do n't know ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB was just sitting here and suddenly everything went dark 
 ProtagonistB ca n't see anything 
  ProtagonistA's heart sank 
 This was ProtagonistA's worst nightmare come true 
 ProtagonistB had been born blind 
 And now , it seemed , ProtagonistB was going deaf as well 
 But ProtagonistB just shook ProtagonistB's head 
  ProtagonistB ca n't hear anything either 
 This was just too much to bear 
 The journey was long and hard , but eventually ProtagonistA made it back to ProtagonistA's kingdom 
 ProtagonistA was warmly welcomed by ProtagonistA's subjects , who had missed ProtagonistA dearly 
 ProtagonistA 's been back for a year now and things are better than ever 
 ProtagonistA was done with this place , this sky , this never - ending blue 
 It was time to move on 
 The sky called out to ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA walked away , but ProtagonistA did n't look back 
 It was a typical Saturday morning , and ProtagonistA's parents were both at work 
 It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA did n't want to waste it inside 
 The diamond was so beautiful that ProtagonistA could n't help but touch it , and as soon as ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA's hair was cut off 
 ProtagonistA was relieved and happy , and ProtagonistA decided to keep the diamond as a reminder of the day when ProtagonistA almost lost ProtagonistA's head 
ProtagonistA's wild optimism was a facade to hide ProtagonistA's true feelings 
 ProtagonistA's friends knew this about ProtagonistA and they always tried to avoid ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA was in one of ProtagonistA's moods 
 However , ProtagonistA's optimistic personality was so infectious that they often found themselves drawn to ProtagonistA despite ProtagonistA's dark side 
 One day , ProtagonistA's friends were having a picnic in the park 
 They were laughing and joking and having a great time 
 However , the picnic was interrupted by a group of aggressive dogs 
 They were barking and growling and seemed ready to attack 
 ProtagonistA's friends were terrified , but ProtagonistA just laughed 
 ProtagonistA's laughter only made the dogs more angry and they started to move closer to the group 
 ProtagonistA's friends begged ProtagonistA to stop laughing , but ProtagonistA just could n't help ProtagonistA 
 In the end , the dogs attacked and everyone was forced to run for their lives 
 It was a horrifying experience , but ProtagonistA just saw it as another adventure 
 ProtagonistA's friends were shaken up by the incident , but ProtagonistA was already planning ProtagonistA's next adventure 
 ProtagonistA held out ProtagonistA's hand and ProtagonistB came closer , sniffing at ProtagonistA's fingers 
 Then , to ProtagonistA's amazement , ProtagonistB spoke 
 Good evening , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB 'm Twilight 
 ProtagonistB 'm sorry to intrude , but ProtagonistB could n't help but notice ProtagonistA's apple 
 May ProtagonistB have a bite?Alice was so surprised that ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistB took a bite , then sat on ProtagonistB's haunches and began to eat 
 As ProtagonistB ate , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life in the forest 
 ProtagonistB told of the other animals ProtagonistB lived with and the adventures ProtagonistB had had 
 ProtagonistA was entranced 
 When ProtagonistB had finished the apple , ProtagonistB bid ProtagonistA goodnight and hopped away into the darkness 
The first time I saw ProtagonistA drape the tray table of ProtagonistA's crib across the kitchen window , it was ProtagonistB , looking through the window and murmuring ,  Oh , there 's ProtagonistC 
  I was so startled that I dropped my book 
 ProtagonistB turned to me with a smile 
  Did n't mean to scare you ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB just wanted to get a better look 
 I peered out the window with ProtagonistB 
 Sure enough , there was ProtagonistC standing in the alley below , looking up at us 
 ProtagonistC was dirty and ragged , but there was something about ProtagonistC's eyes that made me feel sorry for ProtagonistC 
 Do ProtagonistB think ProtagonistC 's lost ?  I asked 
 ProtagonistB shrugged 
  Maybe 
 But ProtagonistC looks like ProtagonistC could use a friend 
 Before I could stop ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB had climbed out the window and was down in the alley with ProtagonistC 
 I watched from above as they talked and laughed together 
 It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship 
 ProtagonistA was instantly attracted to ProtagonistB and they began dating 
ProtagonistA's heart hammered as ProtagonistA's big blue eyes darting around the room 
 ProtagonistA's face was determined as ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's sights on the prize 
 The prize was a big , shiny trophy that represented everything ProtagonistA had worked for 
 It was a beautiful sight , and ProtagonistA was filled with a sense of wonder 
 It was a magical night , and ProtagonistA will never forget it 
  ProtagonistA 'm so glad we get to be best friends!The two ponies had been inseparable since they were foals , and now they were finally old enough to go on adventures together 
 They had already explored the meadow and the forest , and now they were venturing into the dangerous Dark Woods 
 Be careful , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB 
  The Dark Woods are full of dangerous creatures 
 I will ,  promised ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA okay ?  ProtagonistB asked , worried 
 This meant that ProtagonistA had the right to vote and to be elected , even though ProtagonistA was just a princess 
 This meant that the majority of the population had a vote in the matter of electing their king , or rather ProtagonistA 
 Maybe it was because ProtagonistA was getting older now 
 ProtagonistB ran towards ProtagonistA , knife raised , and ProtagonistA turned and ran the other way 
 ProtagonistB chased ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was able to lose ProtagonistB 
 The police were called and ProtagonistB was arrested for the murder of ProtagonistB's wife 
 The flowers were so bright and the sun was so warm 
 The door was open , and ProtagonistA walked through it 
 The trees were so tall and the shadows were so deep 
 But when ProtagonistA got there , the door was gone 
 ProtagonistA was trapped in the forest 
 ProtagonistB always hushed ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA spoke , and ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream when ProtagonistA was with ProtagonistB 
 One day , ProtagonistB passed away 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 So that 's what ProtagonistA did 
 The alicorn was so graceful , flying through the air with ease 
 It was heavenly 
 It wrapped itself around ProtagonistA's body , squeezing tightly 
Some time before the disaster that afflicted the city of Traver , under the watchful eye of the wizard of ProtagonistD , a young maiden named Padma Praline of the house of Pommaries , stood before the Great CENTIME , and told the tale of ProtagonistA , by the spirited chaperone of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was born into a noble family , but ProtagonistA's parents died when ProtagonistA was still a child 
 ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB was also a very strict man 
 ProtagonistB did not approve of ProtagonistA's desire to learn about the world and to help others 
 ProtagonistC was a kind and gentle man , and ProtagonistC quickly fell in love with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB did not approve of the relationship , and ProtagonistB forbid them to see each other 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken , but ProtagonistA did not give up on ProtagonistA's love for ProtagonistC 
 Then , one day , ProtagonistB caught them together 
 ProtagonistB was so angry that ProtagonistB disowned ProtagonistA and threw ProtagonistA out of the house 
 ProtagonistC was surprised to see ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistC was happy to have ProtagonistA there with ProtagonistC 
 They were married soon after , and they lived happily together for the rest of their days 
 ProtagonistE finished ProtagonistE's story , and the Great CENTIME was silent for a moment 
 Then it spoke 
 They talked and then ProtagonistA left 
Rose looked out over the plain , but on the sound of a distant voice ProtagonistA knew exactly where ProtagonistA was 
 It was the sound of ProtagonistB's voice , calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistB was running towards ProtagonistB , and as they met they embraced each other tightly 
 The Hare of the Woods was a creature that ProtagonistA had never seen before and it terrified ProtagonistA 
 It 's kind of late to be doing that , do n't ProtagonistA think ?  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistA was just curious about it , that 's all 
 Well , ProtagonistA should n't be standing out here by ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  It 's not safe 
 Wait ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Let ProtagonistB walk ProtagonistA home 
  Thank ProtagonistB 
 The man walked with ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's house , and made sure ProtagonistA got inside safely 
 It was just a matter of time and opportunity 
 ProtagonistA's boss was getting older and was happy to hand over the reins to someone younger and more energetic 
 Hours passed and ProtagonistA began to grow thirsty 
 They were all saddened by ProtagonistA's death , but no one could explain how ProtagonistA ended up in the hole 
 It was the final performance of the season and everyone was in high spirits 
 The energy was palpable as the contestants put on their final show 
 ProtagonistA was lost 
 ProtagonistA was lost 
 ProtagonistB was surprised to see ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB invited ProtagonistA in 
 ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA some food and a bed for the night 
 ProtagonistA's hair was thin and white , and ProtagonistA's face was covered in wrinkles 
 ProtagonistB was the only person who really talked to ProtagonistA 
 Everyone else in the village just ignored ProtagonistA , or spoke to ProtagonistA in a patronising way 
 But ProtagonistB treated ProtagonistA with respect , and they would often spend hours chatting together 
 ProtagonistB was sad to hear this , but ProtagonistB did n't try to dissuade ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was the only one who came to ProtagonistA's funeral 
 As ProtagonistB stood there alone , ProtagonistB felt a great sense of loss 
 Then , ProtagonistA's boss chewed ProtagonistA out for being late 
 To top it all off , ProtagonistA got stuck in traffic on the way home 
 To ProtagonistA's surprise , it was ProtagonistB 
  Oh , ah , no ou'er here - not here at all - ah , no need to pester ProtagonistA 
 No ! No !  ProtagonistB shrieked , and a rain of feathers slammed into ProtagonistA's head 
A / N : This was supposed to be a story about ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA , once ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's soul back , decided that ProtagonistA did not want to be a princess any longer , and so ProtagonistA is now known as The Princess of the Desert 
 ProtagonistA became known as the Princess of the Desert , and ProtagonistA was happy 
 They did n't judge ProtagonistA and they did n't try to change ProtagonistA 
 It was only when ProtagonistA overheard some of the other ponies talking that ProtagonistA realized just how different ProtagonistB was 
 Apparently , ponies were n't supposed to be able to change their appearance at will , but ProtagonistB could 
 ProtagonistB could make ProtagonistB's mane and tail any color ProtagonistB wanted , and ProtagonistB could make ProtagonistB's eyes any size or shape 
 The other ponies did n't know what to make of ProtagonistB , and neither did ProtagonistA 
 As far as ProtagonistB was concerned , ProtagonistB was just like any other pony 
 Dreams where ProtagonistA was falling , or being chased 
 ProtagonistA's heart was pounding in ProtagonistA's chest and ProtagonistA was sweating 
 ProtagonistB believed ProtagonistA and promised to help ProtagonistA's figure out what was going on 
 together , they did some research and discovered that ProtagonistA was experiencing sleep paralysis 
 It was a scary experience , but at least ProtagonistA knew what was happening 
 The snow was beautiful , but it was also deadly 
 First , ProtagonistA got scolded by ProtagonistA's boss for being late to work 
 To top it all off , ProtagonistA's boyfriend had just broken up with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had on a blue cardigan with a white T - shirt underneath , a pair of jeans with a hole in the knee and a pair of high heels 
 They both laughed and commented on how they looked like they were going to a costume party 
 After they had a few drinks and some dinner , they decided to go dancing 
 They went to a club and danced the night away 
 They had so much fun that they forgot to go home 
 They ended up spending the night at ProtagonistB's house 
 In the morning , they woke up and got dressed 
 They both agreed that it was one of the best nights they had ever had 
 ProtagonistA's kingdom was a happy place , and everyone was happy to be there 
 The sun was setting and the sky was a beautiful orange 
 The clouds were fluffy and white 
 It was good to see the sky again 
 It was a beautiful sight , and ProtagonistA felt very lucky to be able to see it 
 ProtagonistA had been caught stealing a bone from the butcher 's shop 
 The butcher would surely tell ProtagonistA's owner and ProtagonistA would be in for a scolding 
ProtagonistB was a detective , working in the North of England , and ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA 'd never seen anything like it 
 ProtagonistB had been working on a case for weeks , and ProtagonistB was getting nowhere 
 ProtagonistB was getting frustrated , and ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was worried 
 One night , ProtagonistB came home late , and ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB 'd been drinking 
 ProtagonistB sat down at the kitchen table , and ProtagonistA could see the pain in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB was afraid that ProtagonistB was never going to solve it 
 ProtagonistB hugged ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could see the tears in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 The next day , ProtagonistB went back to work , and ProtagonistB was determined to solve the case 
 A few days later , ProtagonistB came home , and ProtagonistB was triumphant 
 ProtagonistB had solved the case , and ProtagonistB was a hero 
 ProtagonistA was buried in a pile of paperwork and ProtagonistA's eyes were starting to hurt from staring at the computer screen 
 It was a nice reminder that there was a world outside of ProtagonistA's office and that ProtagonistA should take some time to enjoy it 
 ProtagonistA's latest victim was ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB 'm not sure ,  ProtagonistB replied 
  ProtagonistB was thinking maybe we could wait for a while and see what happens 
 ProtagonistB was the one who was always eager to take risks 
  We do n't want to make any rash decisions 
  They both knew that the diamond market was volatile 
 It was always changing and it was hard to predict what would happen next 
 They had to be careful 
  ProtagonistB agreed 
 They both knew that they had to be patient 
 The diamond market was never easy to predict 
 It would be the perfect adventure 
 The cold water was a shock but it felt good 
 It was the perfect day 
 They were some of ProtagonistA's closest friends and ProtagonistA had known them for years 
 So when ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB to their home for the first time , ProtagonistB was excited to meet them 
 ProtagonistB was not disappointed 
 The Apple family was warm and welcoming , and ProtagonistB immediately felt at ease in their company 
 They showed ProtagonistB around their home and introduced ProtagonistB to their children 
 ProtagonistB had never felt so welcome before 
 ProtagonistB quickly became good friends with the Apple children , and ProtagonistB loved spending time at their home 
 ProtagonistB always looked forward to ProtagonistB's visits , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB would always cherish ProtagonistB's memories of the Apple family 
ProtagonistA's mother had been trying to talk ProtagonistA into taking a trip to ProtagonistB for years , but ProtagonistA had always resisted 
 The journey was long and hard , but it was worth it when ProtagonistA saw the look of joy on ProtagonistA's mother 's face 
 They spent their days exploring ProtagonistB and meeting new ponies , and ProtagonistA was finally able to see what ProtagonistA's mother had been trying to tell ProtagonistA all along 
 There was something special about ProtagonistB that could n't be found anywhere else 
 ProtagonistA's friends ran to get help , and ProtagonistB , came to ProtagonistA's aid 
 ProtagonistB held ProtagonistA's hoof flat against the back of ProtagonistA's head and used ProtagonistB's magic to lift ProtagonistA into the air and carry ProtagonistA back to ProtagonistA's home 
 The rest of ProtagonistA's body relaxed into the hovering motion of the completed form , and ProtagonistA was soon safe at home 
 The landscape was eerily familiar , yet completely unfamiliar at the same time 
 It looked oddly familiar , but ProtagonistA could n't place why 
 There was no answer 
  ProtagonistA , is that ProtagonistA ?  The voice sounded old and frail 
 ProtagonistA's heart skipped a beat 
 It was the voice of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB in years , not since the day ProtagonistB died 
 This was a place for the dead 
 But before ProtagonistA could turn to run , the door of the cottage opened and ProtagonistB appeared 
 ProtagonistB looked exactly as ProtagonistA remembered ProtagonistB , except ProtagonistB was transparent 
 Yes , ProtagonistB am ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB 've been waiting for ProtagonistA 
 It 's time to go , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA's hand and led ProtagonistA out of the cottage 
 Soon , it was as if ProtagonistA had never been there at all 
ProtagonistA was in the sky and looked like a jewel when ProtagonistA rose , but I never did see ProtagonistA bigger than a ball , and it was n't until I was seventeen that I realized I was bigger than ProtagonistA 
 I was looking at the stars one night , trying to find ProtagonistA again , when I realized that I had outgrown ProtagonistA 
 I had other things to worry about now , like school and my future 
 But every now and then , I still like to look up at the sky and find ProtagonistA shining bright among the stars 
ProtagonistB had been playing with ProtagonistA near the edge of a ruined stream when ProtagonistA suddenly lost ProtagonistA's footing 
 ProtagonistB quickly grabbed onto ProtagonistA to keep ProtagonistA from falling in , but in the process , ProtagonistB lost ProtagonistB's own footing and they both ended up tumbling into the stream 
 Luckily , the water was n't too deep and they were both able to stand up 
 However , their clothes were soaked and they were both shivering from the cold 
 They made their way back to shore and ProtagonistB promised to be more careful in the future 
ProtagonistA's name was Marilyn , but I do not know ProtagonistA or care for ProtagonistA 
 That is , until ProtagonistA saved my life 
 I was walking home one night when I was attacked by a group of thugs 
 I thought for sure I was going to die , but then ProtagonistA appeared out of nowhere and fought them off 
 After that , I could n't help but be interested in ProtagonistA 
 We became friends , and I learned that ProtagonistA was a kind and caring person 
 I will never forget how ProtagonistA saved my life , and I will always be grateful to ProtagonistA for it 
 It was ProtagonistA's first time visiting the Palace and ProtagonistA was determined to make a good impression 
  ProtagonistB smiled and said ,  Welcome , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB am sure ProtagonistA will be a great asset to ProtagonistB's court 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought , wondering if anyone out there was looking back at ProtagonistA 
 It was a peaceful night , and the stars were so bright 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching ProtagonistA 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA was snapped out of ProtagonistA's reverie by a voice 
  Hey there 
 ProtagonistB was looking at ProtagonistA with a curious expression 
 Do ProtagonistA mind if ProtagonistB join ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 ProtagonistB sat down next to ProtagonistA and they both resumed staring up at the stars 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistB spoke again 
 Do ProtagonistA believe in aliens ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 I do ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB think there 's life out there , somewhere 
 Maybe they 're looking at us right now , wondering the same thing 
  That would be pretty cool 
 ProtagonistB smiled 
  Yeah , it would 
 They sat in silence for a while longer , both lost in thought 
 Then , ProtagonistB stood up 
 I should probably get going ,  ProtagonistB said 
  It was nice meeting ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB walked away , then turned ProtagonistA's gaze back to the stars 
 ProtagonistA was exhausted from all the events that had transpired 
 Soon , the whole room was ablaze 
 It was full of beautiful sunflowers 
 Finally , the moment arrived 
 The paperwork was placed in front of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA signed it with a flourish 
 Now ProtagonistB was free , and ProtagonistB would be able to come home 
 It was going to be a happy reunion indeed 
 It was a beautiful night , and the two women had been working hard all day 
 They were both exhausted , but they had made it through the day 
 As they worked , they talked about their plans for the future 
 They both wanted to make a difference in the world , and they were determined to do so 
 They were excited for the new year , and they knew that it would be a good one 
 When they finished their work , they hugged each other and wished each other a happy new year 
 They both knew that it would be a great one 
 It was ProtagonistB's favorite , and ProtagonistA was hoping to impress ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's cooking skills 
 ProtagonistB took a bite , and ProtagonistB's face lit up 
 It was going to be a long and difficult road ahead , but ProtagonistA was determined to get through it 
 Princess Celestia was going to need ProtagonistA now more than ever 
ProtagonistA's eyes were heavy with tears as ProtagonistA gazed down at ProtagonistA's hooves 
 ProtagonistA was filled with thoughts of revenge and escape 
 It seemed like ProtagonistA could never forget to feel sorry for ProtagonistA 
 The Queen had made sure that ProtagonistA's cell was securely locked 
 But now , ProtagonistA had neither excuse 
 When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA was greeted by ProtagonistB 
 They hugged and cried and laughed , and ProtagonistA was finally able to meet ProtagonistA's grandchildren 
 It was a beautiful day , made even more so by the reunion of ProtagonistA and daughter 
  What good dares ProtagonistA do , brother ?  ProtagonistB said 
  If ProtagonistA sees ProtagonistB by the pool , ProtagonistA 'll kill the boys !  ProtagonistC was taken aback by ProtagonistB's words 
 ProtagonistC knew ProtagonistB was joking , but ProtagonistC also knew that ProtagonistC would have to be careful around ProtagonistB from now on 
 They all knew that ProtagonistA had been trying to get pregnant for years , but they never thought it would actually happen 
 They fell in love and got married 
 ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA and smiled 
  Hey , ProtagonistA 
  Just wanted to see what ProtagonistB were up to 
 Just reading this old journal ,  ProtagonistB said 
  It belonged to ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was a bit of a history buff , and ProtagonistC loved to write 
 Oh , just some of the things ProtagonistC did during ProtagonistC's life ,  ProtagonistB replied 
  ProtagonistC was quite a character , from what ProtagonistB can tell 
 ProtagonistB hesitated for a moment , then handed the journal over 
  Sure , why not ? ProtagonistB think ProtagonistA 'll enjoy it 
 The journal was filled with ProtagonistC's thoughts and musings on life , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA quickly absorbed in it 
  ProtagonistC was an amazing man , was n't he?Her father nodded 
  Yes , ProtagonistC was 
 ProtagonistB 'm glad ProtagonistA got to know ProtagonistC a little bit , through ProtagonistC's journal 
  ProtagonistA too , ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA too 
 Good morning , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB 
 I wanted to get a head start on the day ,  said ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB smiled and took the cupcake 
  ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB so well ,  ProtagonistB said 
 The two of them sat down at the table and enjoyed their breakfast together 
 They chatted about their plans for the day and caught up on each other 's news 
 It was a lovely way to start the day 
 The room was decorated in a very old - fashioned style 
 There was a large fireplace in one corner and a grand piano in another 
 The furniture was all very heavy and ornate 
 It fit and ProtagonistA turned it 
 The door opened and ProtagonistA ran out of the room , relieved to be free 
It was the summer day in 1833 that ProtagonistA , was walking ProtagonistA's daughter , Mrs
 John Polkiss , down the road , and considering in ProtagonistA's mind whether ProtagonistA should continue to be a single mother , or if ProtagonistA should go back to the family home , and , indeed , if ProtagonistA should , to marry a man 
 ProtagonistB was a handsome man , and ProtagonistA could n't help but stare at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was John Polkiss , the man ProtagonistA had been thinking about marrying 
 It was as if fate had brought them together 
ProtagonistB had always been curious about ProtagonistA's magic powers 
 ProtagonistB had never seen ProtagonistA use them , but ProtagonistB knew they existed 
 So , when the day the earth froze , ProtagonistA used the last of ProtagonistA's magic power to reveal to ProtagonistB the greatest secret of all , ProtagonistB was thrilled 
 It was an amazing experience for both of them 
 ProtagonistC was trying to prove that ProtagonistA was not in ProtagonistA's right mind at the time of the murder and that ProtagonistA should be found not guilty by reason of insanity 
 ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA what had happened on the day of the murder 
 ProtagonistD asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA had killed ProtagonistB 
 The jury found ProtagonistA not guilty by reason of insanity and ProtagonistA was committed to a mental institution 
  Hello , ProtagonistA 
 Welcome to the White Room 
 The sun was beating down on ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was getting thirsty 
 It sounded like someone was coming 
 Soon , ProtagonistB came into view 
 ProtagonistB was walking quickly , and ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was in a hurry 
 ProtagonistB looked scared , and ProtagonistB was carrying a gun 
 They were shouting and getting closer 
 They were both carrying guns , and they looked like they were about to kill ProtagonistB 
 They both turned and looked at ProtagonistA 
 For a moment , they were both surprised 
 ProtagonistC tried to shoot ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was too quick 
 The two men were both down , but ProtagonistA knew they were n't going to stay down for long 
ProtagonistA's name was ProtagonistA , and forever after , even now when I regret not having the courage to ask ProtagonistA's name , I will not forget ProtagonistA's dark face when ProtagonistA looked up at me with such wonder and such complete and utter confusion 
 There was something in ProtagonistA's eyes that seemed to say ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistA's home again 
 I can still see the fear and the sadness in ProtagonistA's face , and it haunts me to this day 
 However , ProtagonistB was persistent , and eventually ProtagonistA relented and gave ProtagonistB a small smile 
 It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship 
 The door was slightly ajar , and ProtagonistA could hear voices coming from inside 
 There were two people inside , ProtagonistC and ProtagonistB , and they were arguing 
 ProtagonistB was crying , and ProtagonistC was yelling 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistC stormed out of the cottage , slamming the door behind ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB collapsed onto the floor , sobbing 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA , and they began to talk 
 ProtagonistB had been arguing with ProtagonistD , and ProtagonistB was upset because ProtagonistD had just moved out 
 ProtagonistB smiled and thanked ProtagonistA again 
 Then ProtagonistB got up and went to bed 
Stow had been accustomed to being the first one out of the house at the most inconvenient hours of the day 
 The only light was coming from the castle , and the dog that ran in and out of the room was quite a bother 
 It was so clear that ProtagonistA could see the bottom 
 ProtagonistA does n't remember me being born but ProtagonistA 's right ; I have the best hooves on the staff of Everfree 
 The best in magic 
 I was born in the heart of Everfree forest , surrounded by magic 
 My mother was a great sorceress and my father was the king of the forest 
 From the moment I was born , it was clear that I was special 
 I had a gift for magic that was unlike anything anyone had ever seen before 
 ProtagonistA 's seen me at my best and my worst , and ProtagonistA still loves me unconditionally 
 ProtagonistA 's been my best friend ever since 
 To top it all off , ProtagonistA's best friend was mad at ProtagonistA for something ProtagonistA had said the day before 
 ProtagonistB had always been a loyal friend , and ProtagonistB could tell that ProtagonistA was having a tough day 
 ProtagonistB sat with ProtagonistA until ProtagonistA felt better , and then went on ProtagonistB's way 
Mare slits the muzzle of ProtagonistB's gun into the air and lets out a little whine of Oops ! around the top of ProtagonistA's throat 
 Now ProtagonistB is going to be so mad 
 The sun was setting , and the sky was a beautiful orange 
ProtagonistA looked up from the book ProtagonistA was reading , and the tear - streaked blue of ProtagonistA's eyes seemed to say ,  she think we both know what we 're in for 
 The book was a romance novel , and it was full of cliches and unrealistic dialogue 
 Maybe the book would surprise ProtagonistA 
 Alas , it was not to be 
 The book ended exactly as ProtagonistA had expected it to : with a cheesy , happy ending that left ProtagonistA's feeling angry and disappointed 
 ProtagonistA was done with romance novels 
 ProtagonistA was done with books that promised ProtagonistA a good story and then delivered nothing but fluff 
ProtagonistA's hooves stopped pounding the dirt beside the bank , and ProtagonistA's eyes once more settled on the horizon 
 The fire was getting closer , and ProtagonistA could feel the heat on ProtagonistA's skin 
 The flames were getting closer , and ProtagonistA could see the smoke billowing into the sky 
 They were huddled together , their eyes wide with fear 
 It was a strange place , full of creatures that ProtagonistA had never seen before 
 We were a group of friends , all gathered together in this strange place 
 We welcomed ProtagonistA and showed ProtagonistA around 
 We showed ProtagonistA all the different areas of the dream world and introduced ProtagonistA to all the different creatures 
 We became fast friends and would often meet in that strange place , in our dreams 
 ProtagonistA's fingers pressed the slender small mirror against the tabletop in the middle of the room 
 The sky was a beautiful orange , and the clouds were a deep pink 
 Perhaps this was just another challenge for ProtagonistA to overcome 
 This thought bored ProtagonistA beyond measure 
 It was time to either commit to ProtagonistA's job or to find something new 
 The check was ProtagonistA's last hope 
 Finally , the check came in 
 The unicorn was gone and ProtagonistA was surrounded by tall , imposing trees 
 It was going to be a good day 
 It sounded like something was coming towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was frozen in fear 
 It was the most beautiful horse ProtagonistA had ever seen 
 It was a pure white , and it had a mane and tail that flowed in the wind 
 It looked like an angel 
 The horse nickered softly and nuzzled ProtagonistA's nose 
 ProtagonistA 've been meaning to write to ProtagonistB for a long time , but ProtagonistA 'm not sure if ProtagonistB ever got ProtagonistA's previous letters 
 ProtagonistA 'm sorry for not keeping in better touch , but ProtagonistA 've been really busy lately 
 Love , ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had always been a bridesmaid ; ProtagonistA's father had promised a wedding for ProtagonistA and had lived up to that 
 However , when ProtagonistA's father died , ProtagonistA was left with no husband and no wedding 
 ProtagonistA was forced to move in with ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle , who were not very fond of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been married to ProtagonistA's best friend , who had died in a car accident 
 ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA became friends and eventually got married 
The fire had not yet subsided from the ruins of the old slum when ProtagonistA stood in the doorway of the house where I grew up 
 ProtagonistA's parents had died in the fire , and ProtagonistA was all alone in the world 
 I took ProtagonistA in and cared for ProtagonistA as if ProtagonistA were my own daughter 
 I loved ProtagonistA like ProtagonistA was my own flesh and blood 
 The cat seemed to be staring at the moon too , and then it began to speak to ProtagonistA in a soft , calming voice 
 Hello , ProtagonistA 
 Is n't the moon beautiful tonight?Alice was so startled that ProtagonistA could n't speak for a moment 
 It 's so bright and pretty 
 Yes , it is 
 And it 's also very magical 
 Just like ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 
 The cat continued to walk towards ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA took a step back , not sure what to make of this situation 
 Was the cat really talking to ProtagonistA ? And what did it mean by saying ProtagonistA was magical?Before ProtagonistA could say anything else , the cat rubbed against ProtagonistA's leg and then jumped up into ProtagonistA's arms 
 Now , let 's go explore the magic of the moon together , shall we?And with that , the cat led ProtagonistA away into the night 
 It was getting closer and closer , and ProtagonistA could soon make out what it was 
 It was a bird , flying towards ProtagonistA 
 It landed on the ground in front of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA looked at it curiously 
 The raven spoke to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was surprised to understand what it was saying 
 It made sense 
 ProtagonistA was thrown into the back of a van and driven to an unknown location 
 When the van stopped , ProtagonistA was dragged out and thrown into a dark room 
 Suddenly , a light was turned on and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB's face 
 ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's boss ! ProtagonistB had always been creepy , but ProtagonistA never thought ProtagonistB would kidnap ProtagonistA 
  If ProtagonistA make a sound , ProtagonistB 'll kill ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistA was terrified 
ProtagonistA's emails felt for the beast , but ProtagonistA 'd never seen it touch a living thing before 
 ProtagonistB appreciated the support and understanding , but ProtagonistB was still worried 
 ProtagonistB could n't help but worry about the future and what it might hold 
 ProtagonistB was the one who had to make the decisions and ProtagonistB was the one who had to worry about the future 
 The horse was shaking its head and ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head too 
 Suddenly , the horse started to speak 
  Why are ProtagonistA shaking ProtagonistA's head ?  the horse asked 
  ProtagonistA 'm shaking ProtagonistA's hoof 
ProtagonistA's imagination was an echo of ProtagonistA's senses and a recording of ProtagonistA's thoughts 
 It was always a fun game to see how far ProtagonistA's imagination could take ProtagonistA 
 That is , until ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was the new kid in school and ProtagonistB was smart , really smart 
 ProtagonistB knew things that ProtagonistA had never even heard of before 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated by ProtagonistB and quickly became ProtagonistB's friend 
 Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB , for showing ProtagonistA that there was always more to learn 
 It sounded like music 
 There was a fiddle - playing fox , a trumpet - playing deer , and a bear playing the drums 
 It was always so peaceful to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB looked familiar , but ProtagonistA could n't quite place ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA , it 's me , John 
 ProtagonistB 've been looking for ProtagonistA everywhere 
 ProtagonistB 'm so glad ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was confused 
 This is the place between life and death 
 ProtagonistB 've been stuck here for years , ever since ProtagonistB's car accident 
 But ProtagonistB finally found a way out and ProtagonistB came to find ProtagonistA 
 Maybe ProtagonistB could help ProtagonistA get back to reality 
 Come with ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'll show ProtagonistA the way out 
 Together , they walked through the strange place , until they finally came to a door 
 ProtagonistB opened it and gestured for ProtagonistA to go through 
 It worked !  ProtagonistB exclaimed 
 ProtagonistA hugged ProtagonistB , tears of joy streaming down ProtagonistA's face 
 Don't thank ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB replied 
  Thank ProtagonistA 
 It grabbed ProtagonistA with its talons and flew away with ProtagonistA 
 The bird flew into a dark cave and dropped ProtagonistA onto the ground 
 The bird flew back out of the cave and left ProtagonistA alone 
 It was time to end ProtagonistA's reign 
 But now it was time to pass the torch to the next generation 
 ProtagonistA turned and walked back to ProtagonistA's castle , ProtagonistA's head held high 
 ProtagonistA pulled up on the reins and dismounted , then led the mare to a nearby stream to drink 
 It was as if the water from the stream was washing away all ProtagonistA's worries and concerns 
 It was so different from ProtagonistA's life back in the city 
 It was perfect 
 It was so peaceful here 
 It sounded like someone was walking around the fort 
 It was one of the other residents 
 This time , it sounded like someone was trying to break into the fort 
 ProtagonistA was shaken , but ProtagonistA was okay 
There was once , in the sparsely - settled setting of the stone town of Golden ProtagonistA sat , ProtagonistA's eyes closed and listening to the sounds of the surrounding woods 
 It was a peaceful day , with a gentle breeze blowing through the trees and the sun shining down on the small town 
 ProtagonistA thought of the people in the town and how they all seemed to be content with their lives 
 ProtagonistA thought of the animals in the woods and how they must be enjoying the sunny day 
 All of these thoughts brought a smile to ProtagonistA's face 
 What are ProtagonistA looking at , ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB peered over ProtagonistA's shoulder at ProtagonistA 
  They 're all so happy 
   They look it ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB wish ProtagonistB could have a family like that 
  ProtagonistB 're part of ProtagonistA's family now 
 ProtagonistB did n't know who ProtagonistA was , but ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB wanted to be ProtagonistA's friend 
 ProtagonistB walked up to ProtagonistA and said ,  Hi , ProtagonistB's name is ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB smiled and said ,  That 's a pretty name 
 ProtagonistB took it and ProtagonistA shook hands 
Sweetie-6 was sitting in the park , watching the children play 
  Are n't ProtagonistB going to go home ? said Sweetie-6 , scratching ProtagonistA's head 
  ProtagonistB shrugged ProtagonistB's shoulders and said that ProtagonistB did n't know 
 Sweetie-6 told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB should go home , because it was getting late 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB did n't want to go home , because ProtagonistB did n't want to be alone 
 Sweetie-6 told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB could come and sit with ProtagonistA for a while , and then ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistB's home 
 ProtagonistB agreed , and the two of them sat in the park together until it was time for ProtagonistB to go home 
 ProtagonistB neighed softly as ProtagonistA ran the brush through ProtagonistB's mane 
 Those were the days when ProtagonistA was carefree and happy 
 It was a special bond that ProtagonistA cherished 
ProtagonistA's father had been waiting for ProtagonistA for hours 
 It was getting late , and the moon was already high in the sky 
 ProtagonistA's father was getting worried 
 ProtagonistA's father was relieved 
 They went home and went to bed 
 After ProtagonistA's father died , ProtagonistA was left to fend for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's owner , understanding ProtagonistA's needs , had taken ProtagonistA to the park for a run 
 It was time to go 
 ProtagonistA had been born in this place and ProtagonistA had never left 
 It sounded too good to be true 
 They were excited for ProtagonistA 
 It was so beautiful 
 ProtagonistA was also asked to join the college choir , and ProtagonistA quickly became one of the best singers 
 ProtagonistB approached ProtagonistA , a satisfied smirk on ProtagonistB's face 
  Just another trophy for ProtagonistB's collection ,  ProtagonistB said coldly as ProtagonistB pulled out ProtagonistB's knife to skin ProtagonistA 
 The last thing ProtagonistA saw was ProtagonistB's knife coming towards ProtagonistA , before everything went black 
 It was beautiful , and ProtagonistA felt so lucky to be able to experience it 
ProtagonistA rode silently toward ProtagonistA's cabin , ProtagonistA's eyes half - closed and ProtagonistA's mind racing in its mind 's eye 
 It seemed like only yesterday ProtagonistA had been living a normal life , going to work and spending time with ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistB stepped out into the light , and ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB was a woman 
 ProtagonistB was holding a gun , and ProtagonistB looked very tired 
 The rain was a welcome respite from ProtagonistA's thoughts 
 So when ProtagonistA came to ProtagonistB one day and told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had found a new place for them to live , ProtagonistB was n't really surprised 
 What did surprise ProtagonistB , however , was the place ProtagonistA had found 
 ProtagonistB was scared at first , but ProtagonistA assured ProtagonistB that there was nothing to be afraid of 
  And we 'll be the heroes of our own story 
 So ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA moved into the old house in the woods and began their adventure 
 They soon found out that the stories about ProtagonistC were true , but they also found out that ProtagonistC was n't really a bad person 
 In fact , ProtagonistC was quite lonely and was happy to have some company 
 ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA became good friends with ProtagonistC and would often sit by the fire and listen to ProtagonistC's stories 
 It was a magical time for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB knew that this was a story ProtagonistB would always remember 
 It was so peaceful 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 It led ProtagonistA to a clearing where ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's friends , fast asleep 
 Then , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB was moving away 
 It was ProtagonistC , asking ProtagonistA to help ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistC was n't really gone 
 ProtagonistC was just hurt and needed ProtagonistA's help 
 ProtagonistC was going to be okay 
 Even though ProtagonistA's day had started out terrible , it had ended on a good note 
 ProtagonistA was reminded that ProtagonistA always had the power to help others , even when it felt like ProtagonistA's own world was falling apart 
 Oh , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA ,  do ProtagonistB remember what ProtagonistA did this ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA and shook ProtagonistB's head 
 I'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB ca n't help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was n't with ProtagonistA this morning 
  Relief washed over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA finally remembered what ProtagonistA had done 
 One day , during a particularly brutal battle , ProtagonistA was gravely injured 
 It was the light of the Fox God , and it filled ProtagonistA with strength and courage 
 ProtagonistA's people were victorious , and they owed their lives to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was conceived in the winter of my year , seventeen months after ProtagonistB was twenty - four years old 
 ProtagonistA was born in the great Kingdom of Equestria , which was in a tier - one position at the time 
 ProtagonistA was loved by all , especially ProtagonistA's two closest friends , Malachite of the Crystal Metals and ProtagonistB 
 The three of them were inseparable , and they always had each other 's backs , no matter what 
 One day , when they were out on a quest together , they ran into a group of bandits 
 The bandits were heavily armed and outnumbered them three to one 
 ProtagonistA's friends were amazed at ProtagonistA's power , and they knew that ProtagonistA was destined for great things 
 ProtagonistA was loved by all , and ProtagonistA lived a long and happy life with ProtagonistA's two best friends by ProtagonistA's side 
 ProtagonistA is thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how it has led ProtagonistA to this moment 
 The sun was just beginning to set when ProtagonistA finally found what ProtagonistA was looking for 
 The sound of the waves crashing against the rocks was soothing , and the smell of salt was invigorating 
 ProtagonistA , don't!She turned to see ProtagonistA's mother running towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had always been warned about the dangers of the cliff , but ProtagonistA had never thought ProtagonistA would actually be in any danger 
 What are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistA's mother asked , out of breath 
 You did n't scare me ,  ProtagonistA's mother said 
  I was just worried about ProtagonistA 
 Let 's go back to the car ,  ProtagonistA's mother said 
  I think we 've seen enough of the ocean for one day 
I had never heard of ProtagonistA until ProtagonistA was gone , but ProtagonistA was exactly what I was 
 We were both creative souls who loved to express ourselves through art 
 We both loved to laugh and have fun , and we were both always up for a good time 
 ProtagonistB must have gone home 
 Suddenly , the rabbit disappeared and ProtagonistA saw a door in the tree 
ProtagonistA's parents must have been sleeping soundly , because ProtagonistA had a passion for all things water - related , from swimming to pot - dancing 
 ProtagonistA swam laps for hours , until ProtagonistA's skin was pruned and ProtagonistA's muscles ached 
 ProtagonistA felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA back and then everything went black 
 It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining down on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt like a fool , like ProtagonistA had been played for a fool 
 But it turned out ProtagonistB had only wanted one thing from ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had given it to ProtagonistB so easily 
 ProtagonistA turned and walked away from ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA's head held high 
 No one knew why ProtagonistA had been spared , but ProtagonistA was grateful 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to end up like ProtagonistA's brothers and sisters , their entrails spilling out onto the cold , hard ground 
 ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's books and ProtagonistA's cats and that was all ProtagonistA needed 
 One day , ProtagonistA's peaceful life was shattered 
 They took ProtagonistA to the same spot where ProtagonistA's brothers and sisters had been killed and then they disemboweled ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA lay there dying , ProtagonistA could only think one thing : why was ProtagonistA the only one who had been spared ? 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought , wondering what to do with the feathers 
 Maybe it would be better to leave them where they were 
 After all , they probably belonged to some bird 
 But then again , maybe the bird was dead and the feathers were all that was left 
 ProtagonistB ?  said ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's hoof hovering over the apple cart 
  Are ProtagonistB sure ProtagonistB want to do this?I'm positive ,  said ProtagonistB 
  After all , we 've been planning this for months 
 But what if something goes wrong?Nothing will go wrong ,  said ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB have everything under control 
 Haggerty 
 Don't worry , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB wo n't let anything happen to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a reassuring smile and began to push the cart down the hill 
 At first , everything went according to plan 
 The cart picked up speed and ProtagonistA began to scream , but ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA was enjoying the ride 
 The wind was whipping through ProtagonistA's hair and ProtagonistA felt alive 
 There was a large rock in the middle of the path and the cart was heading straight for it 
 But it was too late 
 The cart slammed into the rock and overturned , sending ProtagonistA flying through the air 
 ProtagonistA ! Speak to ProtagonistB !  said ProtagonistB , frantic 
  ProtagonistA's name is Sarah 
   Hello , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA replied 
  It 's nice to meet ProtagonistA 
 They laughed and shared stories 
 It was a beautiful day , and the two women enjoyed each other 's company 
Alice and ProtagonistA were just finishing up loading ProtagonistA's car when they noticed their neighbors peering through their windows with panicked looks on their faces 
 Alice and James exchanged confused glances before quickly finishing up and getting into the car 
 ProtagonistB was followed by a man , and then another , and another , until it seemed like the whole neighborhood was filled with people running and screaming 
 Alice and ProtagonistA ran inside and locked all the doors and windows , huddling together in the living room as they listened to the chaos outside 
 It was a chilly , dark , and stormy morning , and Alice and James were surrounded by the hysterical hearers 
ProtagonistA has been seen seated on the floor , ProtagonistA's heels creaking slightly , the air of a confined space , and ProtagonistA sits quietly , a slight air of nervousness attached to ProtagonistA , as if ProtagonistA were about to lose ProtagonistA's temper 
 It was small , with no windows and only one door 
 The door was locked , and ProtagonistA had the key 
 ProtagonistA was given food and water , but no one came to check on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB looked around the room before settling ProtagonistB's gaze on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm here to help ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB know this must be hard for ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB continued 
  But ProtagonistB promise , ProtagonistB 'm here to help ProtagonistA 
 I'm going to get ProtagonistA out of here , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA's help 
 ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA to trust ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB replied 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA what ProtagonistB needed ProtagonistA to do and ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB's instructions 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA was brave and ProtagonistA smiled 
 No , I do n't really like it ,  the other horse replied 
 I do n't know ,  the other horse said 
  But it 's not really that bad 
 It was n't that bad 
 In fact , it was kind of nice 
 It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was surrounded by ProtagonistA's friends 
 But something was off 
 ProtagonistA's friends froze , and they all turned to look at the source of the noise 
 Out from the undergrowth came a large , furry creature 
 It was a bear!The bear stood up on its hind legs and let out a mighty roar 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends were terrified 
 They had never seen a bear this close before 
 The bear began to walk towards them , and they all backed away in fear 
 We 're not going to hurt you 
 Amazingly , the bear stopped and sniffed ProtagonistA's hand 
 Then it did something even more amazing 
 It sat down and let ProtagonistA pet it!After a few minutes , the bear got up and wandered off into the woods 
 But they would never forget their close encounter with a real live bear ! 
 ProtagonistA had been ridden by many people , but ProtagonistA's favorite was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB would come to the farm every day and brush ProtagonistA's mane and give ProtagonistA a carrot 
 One day , ProtagonistB did n't come to the farm 
 The next day , ProtagonistB came to the farm , but ProtagonistB was different 
 ProtagonistB was sad and ProtagonistB's eyes were red 
 ProtagonistB did n't say anything , ProtagonistB just hugged ProtagonistA's neck and cried 
 It was so peaceful here , so different from the hustle and bustle of the city 
 Life was good 
 But then , ProtagonistB Sparkle came into the room and ruined everything 
 I'm out of cupcakes ,  ProtagonistB said , looking miserable 
  And ProtagonistB really wanted one 
 Oh , ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's smile fading 
 It 's not the same ,  ProtagonistB said , pouting 
  ProtagonistB wanted that one 
 ProtagonistB was out of cupcakes , and ProtagonistB was not happy about it 
 The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was putting on a dress with a watch attached to it 
 ProtagonistA tried to move ProtagonistA's arms and legs but they were stuck 
  The voice was soft and gentle 
 ProtagonistA tried to open ProtagonistA's eyes but ProtagonistA could n't 
  The voice said again 
 The dress and watch were gone 
 After a bit of convincing , ProtagonistC finally handed it over 
 They were both relieved to be reunited 
 But there was still the matter of why ProtagonistB had been imprisoned 
 That would have to wait for another day 
 For now , they were just happy to be together again 
 They had all been through so much together , and now they were finally free 
 But even in their freedom , they were still bound by the memories of what they had endured 
 They would never be able to forget , but at least they could be together and support each other through it 
 The sun was setting and the water was sparkling 
 ProtagonistA's friend said ,  This is the most beautiful thing I 've ever seen 
 They stood there for a long time , just admiring the view 
 ProtagonistA's favorite part was sticking ProtagonistA's head out the window and feeling the wind in ProtagonistA's fur 
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes 
 It had all started innocently enough 
 It was the perfect plan 
 But ProtagonistB did 
 ProtagonistB reached under the counter and grabbed ProtagonistA by the arm 
  ProtagonistB knew someone was stealing ProtagonistB's cupcakes !  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistA was dragged out of the shop and into the back room 
 ProtagonistB tied ProtagonistA to a chair and began to interrogate ProtagonistA 
  Why are ProtagonistA stealing ProtagonistB's cupcakes ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 Cake looked at ProtagonistA sympathetically 
  ProtagonistB understand ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB 'm going to have to call the police 
 ProtagonistA was taken to the police station and charged with theft 
 ProtagonistA was given a stern warning and told to stay away from the cupcake shop 
 The water was a deep blue , almost black , and the waves were high and foamy 
 The old woman invited ProtagonistA in , and offered ProtagonistA a cupcake 
 The old woman showed ProtagonistA to a room , and ProtagonistA fell asleep as soon as ProtagonistA's head hit the pillow 
 The old woman was nowhere to be found , but there was a freshly baked batch of cupcakes on the table 
 ProtagonistA had been born six months earlier , and ProtagonistA's mother had died shortly after giving birth 
 ProtagonistB had been away on business when ProtagonistA was born , and by the time ProtagonistB got back , ProtagonistA's mother had passed away 
 ProtagonistA had been raised by ProtagonistA's grandparents since then , and they had told ProtagonistA all about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC was handsome , and ProtagonistC looked a lot like ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was confused 
 ProtagonistC introduced ProtagonistC as ProtagonistA's father 
 ProtagonistC explained that ProtagonistC had been away on business when ProtagonistA was born and that ProtagonistC had only recently found out about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistC said that ProtagonistC had been looking for ProtagonistA for months 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled to finally meet ProtagonistB 
 They talked and laughed all the way to the Smithers 
 When they arrived , ProtagonistB invited ProtagonistA to come and live with ProtagonistB 
 The view from the dining room was beautiful , and ProtagonistA felt at peace 
 It was a small black dot , and it was getting closer 
 It was a crow , and it was flying straight towards ProtagonistA 
 The crow landed on the ground in front of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA reached out to touch it 
  It was so stupid 
ProtagonistB was always telling ProtagonistA to hurry up 
  Come on , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB would say 
  We do n't want to be late for ProtagonistA's piano lesson 
  There 's no hurry , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC would tell ProtagonistA 
  Life is too short to rush through it 
  But ProtagonistB was always in a hurry 
 ProtagonistB was always rushing around , trying to get things done 
  Come on , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB would say 
  Let 's go 
Carol Sparkle was out of cupcakes 
 Pinkie must have gone to the royal court 
 They wore flowing white dresses , or rather , they wore dresses like they were made of paper 
 All those years of stick - figure cartoon ponies that had been created by the Evil Weasels had all been wiped out , and now there was nothing but the images of ponies hoofing around a campfire 
 None of them , that is , when ProtagonistA had the chance to show them 
It 's all right , Sweetie Belle , said Alice , because it was always good to know what ProtagonistA was thinking or doing , and if ProtagonistA was right , ProtagonistA was always wiser than ProtagonistA was 
 But now that they were both adults , it was harder to keep track of ProtagonistA's thoughts , and harder still to offer sage advice 
ProtagonistA was perched on the edge of a high bank , snapping the last few pennies from ProtagonistA's neck when ProtagonistA heard the call of an emergency 
 It was a short ride , but it made ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistB 
 Some would even applaud 
There was ProtagonistA 
 They had been together for two years and were very happy 
 One day , ProtagonistB proposed to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA said yes 
 They were both very excited and began planning their wedding 
 Everything was going great until ProtagonistC found out about the engagement 
 ProtagonistC was not happy about it and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could not marry ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken and did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistB was holding a telescope , and ProtagonistB offered it to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about the constellations and the stories behind them 
 ProtagonistA was entranced 
 ProtagonistA was so captivated by their beauty that ProtagonistA forgot to finish ProtagonistA's sketch 
 It was the most beautiful horse ProtagonistA had ever seen 
 It was all ProtagonistA could do to keep from crying 
 But now , it was gone 
 burned to the ground in a matter of hours 
 It seemed like ProtagonistA's feet had a mind of their own , carrying ProtagonistA away from ProtagonistA's old life and into this new one 
 The sun was setting now , and ProtagonistA could see a faint light in the distance 
 It was small and rundown , but it was home 
 ProtagonistB stood there , ProtagonistB's face lined with years of worry and hardship 
 But when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB's eyes lit up with hope 
 ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA were never coming back 
 The sun was setting behind the mountains , and the sky was a beautiful shades of orange and red 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB must have followed ProtagonistA 
 Rainbow Dash , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 But ProtagonistA do n't even know what 's on the other side ,  ProtagonistB said 
 The sun was shining and the birds were singing 
 It was a perfect day 
 It sounded like someone was in trouble 
 The rabbits were safe 
 It was a hot day , and ProtagonistA had been working in the garden for hours 
 It was a strange light , and it was coming from the other side of the garden 
 The voice was strange , and it sounded like it was coming from the hole 
 It was a small creature , and it was very strange looking 
 It had big eyes , and it was wearing a strange hat 
 I am the Cheshire Cat ,  the creature said 
  And I have come to take ProtagonistA on an adventure 
 They were all amazed , and a little bit scared 
 When ProtagonistA came to , ProtagonistA was surrounded by ProtagonistA's worried friends 
 They were all relieved that ProtagonistA was okay , but ProtagonistA was embarrassed 
 ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's job , ProtagonistA's cat had run away , and ProtagonistA's boyfriend had just broken up with ProtagonistA 
 It was just the thing ProtagonistA needed to brighten ProtagonistA's day 
 It was ProtagonistA's happy place 
 It was ProtagonistA's refuge 
 It felt like ProtagonistA could see everything from up there and nothing could touch ProtagonistA 
 It was ProtagonistA's sanctuary 
 And that was enough 
 It was a simple blouse , but it made ProtagonistA feel beautiful 
ProtagonistB eyed ProtagonistA , but had no intention of touching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB did n't want to ruin ProtagonistA's perfect image with ProtagonistB's own messiness 
  ProtagonistA 'm here for ProtagonistB 
  From that moment on , ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB could always count on ProtagonistA to be there for ProtagonistB , no matter what 
 But now , ProtagonistA was retired 
 The sun was getting higher in the sky , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to find shelter soon 
 A woman answered the door 
 The woman said yes , and ProtagonistA went inside 
 Suddenly , the door to the room opened and ProtagonistB walked in 
 But ProtagonistB just smiled and walked over to ProtagonistA 
 It 's okay , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB do n't mind if ProtagonistA use ProtagonistB's desk 
 In fact , ProtagonistB think it 's great that ProtagonistA 're curious about it 
 ProtagonistB then showed ProtagonistA how to use the desk 
 ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA how to hold the pen and how to make marks on the paper 
 That 's great , ProtagonistA !  said ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA 'll be writing like a pro in no time 
 And it was all thanks to ProtagonistA's curiosity 
 The ball suddenly stopped and ProtagonistA saw a vision of ProtagonistA robbing the bank 
 ProtagonistA was shocked at first , but then ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA could use ProtagonistA's power to see the future to ProtagonistA's advantage 
 ProtagonistB was an interesting person , to say the least 
 ProtagonistB was always well - dressed and put - together , but there was something about ProtagonistB that made ProtagonistA want to know more 
 ProtagonistA had been born and raised in the bustling city of Camelot 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistB was hired 
 ProtagonistB ProtagonistA was soon demoted and then , eventually , forced to retire 
 ProtagonistB , quickly became ProtagonistC's favorite 
 ProtagonistB was always by ProtagonistC's side , protecting ProtagonistC and serving ProtagonistC 
 It was something about a rabbit and a hole 
 It was ProtagonistB 
  Good morning , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB was just out for ProtagonistB's morning walk and ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA sitting here 
 ProtagonistB hope ProtagonistA 're doing well 
   That 's interesting ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB sometimes have trouble remembering ProtagonistB's dreams , too 
 Well , ProtagonistB 'll let ProtagonistA get back to it 
 Have a good day 
 The development was beautiful , with pristine houses and well - manicured lawns 
 The doctors told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had suffered a stroke and would not be able to drive or live on ProtagonistA's own anymore 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 The first thing ProtagonistA had to do was find a way to get ProtagonistA's notebook out of the trunk behind the desk 
 If the librarian found it , ProtagonistA would be kicked out for sure 
 ProtagonistA had been coming here since ProtagonistA was a child and the memories of ProtagonistA's mother and father taking ProtagonistA here were some of ProtagonistA's fondest 
 The waters were murky and the air felt heavy 
 It was as if they had all been poisoned 
 ProtagonistA was horrified 
 This was ProtagonistA's beloved Seven Seas , and it was being destroyed 
 The people of Latron were shocked and horrified , but they knew they had to act 
 Together , they worked to clean up the river and to find out what had caused the pollution 
 It was a long and difficult process , but eventually the Seven Seas were restored to their former glory 
 Tired of fighting , tired of struggling 
 ProtagonistA was done fighting 
 Done struggling 
 Done caring 
 The sun was setting and the sky was a beautiful orange 
 It was good to be alive 
ProtagonistA had been waiting for the moment , talking to ProtagonistB , when it would happen : here were ProtagonistA's feet , well - nigh barefoot , with their unkempt , patchy hair , and ProtagonistA's hands folded under the lids , as if ProtagonistA had been carrying them for some months , so that ProtagonistA's hands should have a little more room , and ProtagonistA's fingers a little less clumsy , than when ProtagonistA was twelve 
 It had been a long time since ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was excited to finally be able to talk to ProtagonistB about what was happening in ProtagonistA's life 
 So , ProtagonistA , what have ProtagonistA been up to ?  ProtagonistB asked , after they had exchanged pleasantries 
 ProtagonistA 'm also waiting for ProtagonistA's hands to be a little less clumsy , so that ProtagonistA can do more things with them 
 I see ,  ProtagonistB said , nodding ProtagonistB's head 
  It just feels right 
 Like it 's something ProtagonistA 'm supposed to do 
 I see ,  ProtagonistB said again 
 That sounds like a lot of fun ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA 're very good at all of those things 
 I'm sure that moment will come , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Just keep waiting and working hard , and it will happen 
I remember ProtagonistA ; I remember ProtagonistA being born a little after 1852 
 It seemed that ProtagonistB had been secretly stockpiling weapons and planning to overthrow the king 
 When ProtagonistA confronted ProtagonistB about it , ProtagonistB tried to kill ProtagonistA 
 The king and his army were able to stop ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's rebels before they could do any damage 
 ProtagonistA was hailed as a hero and ProtagonistA was able to live happily ever after 
 ProtagonistA was filled with the cheer of ProtagonistA's captain and the joy of ProtagonistA's crew 
 The voyage was long and arduous , but eventually they arrived in the new world 
 The new world was everything ProtagonistA had hoped for and more 
 ProtagonistA was filled with a sense of wonder and adventure 
 The general said ,  As a matter of course , ProtagonistA 's here on trial 
 It had been a long day , and ProtagonistA was looking forward to losing ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's favorite story 
 But ProtagonistA's sister 's voice kept interrupting ProtagonistA's thoughts 
 I was just wondering if ProtagonistA could help me with my homework 
  ProtagonistA 'm trying to read , ca n't it wait?But I need ProtagonistA's help 
  Fine , what do you need?As ProtagonistA's sister explained ProtagonistA's homework problem , ProtagonistA's mind wandered back to ProtagonistA's book 
 ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by ProtagonistB's ability to shoot an arrow with such accuracy , and ProtagonistA was determined to learn how to do it ProtagonistA 
 It flew straight and true , hitting the target dead center 
 ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA how to hold the bow and how to position the arrow 
 ProtagonistB then helped ProtagonistA take aim and release the arrow 
 It flew wide of the target , but ProtagonistA was thrilled nonetheless 
 ProtagonistA had begged ProtagonistA's parents to take ProtagonistA and they finally relented 
 ProtagonistA 's been homeschooled ProtagonistA's whole life , and ProtagonistA 's never even been to a public school 
 ProtagonistA's parents are a bit odd , and they 've always been really strict about ProtagonistA's education 
 ProtagonistA 's never even been allowed to go to a sleepover or anything 
 But now that ProtagonistA 's turning 18 , ProtagonistA 's thinking about maybe going to college 
 It 's something ProtagonistA 's always wanted to do , and ProtagonistA 's finally old enough to make ProtagonistA's own decisions 
 Wish ProtagonistA's luck ! 
 It was a comfortable silence between them , one that did n't need to be filled with words 
ProtagonistA's world was on fire , and ProtagonistA did not know it , but ProtagonistA knew it was the end 
 The flames licked at ProtagonistA's skin and ProtagonistA could feel the heat of them on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA was trapped 
 The flames surrounded ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistA's skin burning 
 They sent ProtagonistA to live with ProtagonistA's aunt in the human world , hoping that ProtagonistA would learn some responsibility 
 ProtagonistA was soon lost , but ProtagonistA did n't mind 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it was true , that ProtagonistA's life was over 
 It did n't seem real 
 It was n't supposed to happen like this 
 ProtagonistB sat down on the floor next to ProtagonistA and put ProtagonistB's arm around ProtagonistA 
 I'm so sorry , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
Two days ago ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends had an idea : they would all bake cakes and then have a competition to see who could decorate their cake the best 
 So that 's what they did 
 ProtagonistA's cake was a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and chocolate chips 
 ProtagonistA's friends ' cakes were all different flavors , but they all looked delicious 
 The competition was close , but in the end ProtagonistA's cake won ! 
 It was a habit that ProtagonistA had developed over the years , ever since ProtagonistB was born 
 It was a small act of love that ProtagonistA did every day , and it always made ProtagonistA feel better 
 It was a way for ProtagonistA to show ProtagonistA's love and care for ProtagonistB , even if ProtagonistB was no longer a little filly 
 But this time , something was different 
 It was then that ProtagonistA saw it 
 The world was different 
 The colors were brighter , the people were walking around with a skip in their step 
 It was as if everyone was happy 
 But when ProtagonistA looked back out the window , the scene was still there 
 ProtagonistA was born in the early 1900s in a small town in the Midwest 
 They did n't allow ProtagonistA to go to the movies or out with ProtagonistA's friends 
 They were laughing and having a great time 
 They were wearing short skirts and high heels 
 That 's what ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA looked down at ProtagonistA's hooves 
 It made ProtagonistA feel safe , but it also made ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistA was always on the verge of being caught 
 But now , sitting on the floor of ProtagonistA's hoof , all ProtagonistA had left was a sad , mushy mess 
 Either way , ProtagonistA was now left with nothing but a mushy apple and a whole lot of disappointment 
 ProtagonistB was different than any of the other guys ProtagonistA had dated 
 They started dating seriously and after a few months , they got married 
 The colors were so vibrant and the sky was so clear 
When ProtagonistA froze in the doorway of ProtagonistA's house , ProtagonistB came toward ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was a tall , dark figure , draped in a cloak that seemed to absorb all the light around it 
 In ProtagonistB's hand ProtagonistB held a long , sharp blade 
 ProtagonistA's heart raced as ProtagonistB approached ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was paralyzed with fear 
 ProtagonistB reached ProtagonistA and grabbed ProtagonistA by the throat 
 ProtagonistB stared at ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's cold , dead eyes and then ProtagonistB spoke 
 I've come for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was too strong 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB brought ProtagonistA to a dark , dank dungeon 
 ProtagonistB threw ProtagonistA into a cell and then locked the door 
 ProtagonistA was left alone in the darkness , terrified of what ProtagonistB might do to ProtagonistA next 
There 's ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA ai n't going nowhere 
 ProtagonistA 's been stuck in this small town ProtagonistA's whole life and ProtagonistA 's just about had enough 
 Everyone here knows ProtagonistA's name and ProtagonistA's story , and ProtagonistA 's sick of it 
 ProtagonistA 's been saving up for years , and ProtagonistA 's finally got enough money to buy a one - way ticket out of here 
 ProtagonistA 's packed ProtagonistA's bags and ProtagonistA 's ready to go 
 The only thing left to do is say goodbye to ProtagonistA's friends and family 
 It 's time for ProtagonistA to start a new adventure 
  ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistA , where are ProtagonistA ?  It was ProtagonistB's voice 
  ProtagonistA ! Help ProtagonistB !  ProtagonistB cried 
ProtagonistA leaned against the wall of the library , ProtagonistA's huge body pressed against the paper , ProtagonistA's hooves whinnying 
 ProtagonistA's owner , Mrs
 White , had died a few years ago , and since then , ProtagonistA had been living in the library 
 The librarians took care of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was happy there 
 The sun was setting and the sky was a beautiful orange 
 It was a beautiful sight , but it was also a reminder of the great responsibility ProtagonistA had 
 It was a beautiful sight 
 The sun was setting and the sky was a beautiful orange 
 ProtagonistB looked so peaceful as ProtagonistB floated by 
ProtagonistB was lying down under the wing of ProtagonistA , staring up at ProtagonistA's blue and white Pip Puff 
 ProtagonistB was thinking about how much ProtagonistB loved flying and how happy ProtagonistB was to be able to share that love with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB felt a warm breeze blowing through the feathers on ProtagonistB's back and knew that ProtagonistA was also enjoying the moment 
 ProtagonistB was hesitant , but finally relented 
 They set off on their journey and ProtagonistA was soon lost in thought , imagining all the adventures ProtagonistA would have 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA was brought out of ProtagonistA's reverie by a rustling in the bushes 
 ProtagonistB had disappeared and ProtagonistA was now alone 
 It was ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistB had been hiding , trying to scare ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to go back to ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistA did n't want to stay in the forest either 
 ProtagonistA was stuck in the middle , not knowing what to do 
 They were n't going to let ProtagonistA leave until ProtagonistA had convinced ProtagonistB to do so 
 ProtagonistA finally convinced ProtagonistB to come with ProtagonistA and they left for their adventure 
 The sun was just peeking over the horizon , and the sky was a beautiful orange 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA's castle and asked ProtagonistA to marry ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA , was perched in ProtagonistA's perch on the port bow of the vessel , watching the sun set over the waters of the Great Sea 
 The colors were so beautiful , ProtagonistA thought , and the air was so fresh and salty 
 ProtagonistA was outnumbered and outmatched , but ProtagonistA fought with all ProtagonistA's might 
 The pirates tied ProtagonistA up and brought ProtagonistA to their ship 
 They locked ProtagonistA in a cell and left ProtagonistA there to rot 
 When ProtagonistB answered , ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA 'm pregnant 
 At first , ProtagonistB did n't say anything 
 ProtagonistB just stood there , staring at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was quiet for a moment , then ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB 'm not ready to be a father 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistA turned and walked away , tears streaming down ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA had been told by the doctor that ProtagonistA would never be able to play again 
 This was devastating news for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was also told that ProtagonistA would need to have surgery to repair the damage 
 This would be a long and difficult recovery process 
 During ProtagonistA's recovery , ProtagonistB , was by ProtagonistA's side every step of the way 
 ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA with everything , from going to the bathroom to getting dressed 
 “ Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA 
 In ProtagonistA's world , there were creatures called Jabberwocks 
 They were big and scary , and they would eat people if they caught them 
 The other children in the room were wide - eyed , and they stared at ProtagonistA in disbelief 
 They had never heard of such a thing happening in their world 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear ProtagonistA's mom coming up behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistA's mom asked 
 Well , ProtagonistA need to come help me with dinner ,  ProtagonistA's mom said 
 It was so beautiful here , so peaceful 
 It was ProtagonistA's happy place 
 But now , everything was different 
 The world was different 
 It was a scary place now 
 ProtagonistA was so lost , so alone 
 A light 
 A beacon of hope 
 There were people there 
 People who could help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's friends were worried about ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was just fine 
 In front of ProtagonistA was a large oasis , and ProtagonistA could see people and animals gathered around it , drinking and bathing and laughing 
 ProtagonistA was born different , with hooves instead of hands 
 ProtagonistA's parents had tried to hide ProtagonistA away , but eventually the other ponies had found out 
 They had ridiculed ProtagonistA , called ProtagonistA a freak 
 ProtagonistA dreamed of a day where ProtagonistA was the one in charge , the one who made all the decisions 
 ProtagonistA dreamed of a day where ProtagonistA was the one who got to decide what everyone else did 
 It was a wonderful dream , and ProtagonistA woke up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the world 
 ProtagonistA's hair was pulled back in a loose braid , and ProtagonistA had a small smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 The camera clicked , and ProtagonistA turned to the side , ProtagonistA's eyes still on the lens 
 It felt good to be out of the truck and moving around 
 It was exactly what ProtagonistA was looking for 
 ProtagonistA had been kidnapped , held captive , and was about to be sold into slavery 
 But ProtagonistA was saved by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB placed ProtagonistA in the care of ProtagonistA's only friend , Applejack , and told ProtagonistA to never give up hope 
It was in the year 1763 when , in a county in western France , a small town named Vernay was formed , and the village of Neuve - Chalmers had its first residents 
 The name and the first and only dame which has ever been mentioned in the history of France , was Mary Moodie , a little lady of twenty - one , with a pretty face , fine features , and freckles , who , with ProtagonistB , was well known in the world for ProtagonistA's literary talent and for ProtagonistA's indomitable resolution 
 The village was located in a county in western France and was newly formed 
 Despite being the only residents , the couple was well known in the world for their literary talent and ProtagonistA's indomitable resolution 
 The village of Neuve - Chalmers was a quiet and peaceful place 
 The only sounds that could be heard were the birds chirping and the leaves rustling in the wind 
 It was the perfect place to live if you wanted to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city 
 It looked like it had been abandoned for years 
 They decided to explore it and see if there was anything of value inside 
 As they entered the cottage , they were surprised to find that it was clean and well - kept 
 It was obvious that someone had been living there 
 They looked around and saw that there were clothes and food in the cupboards 
 It was then that they realized that they had stumbled upon someone 's secret hideaway 
 They decided to leave the cottage and not tell anyone about their discovery 
 It was clear that the person who was living there wanted to be left alone and they respected that 
 Although they never saw the person who was living in the cottage , Mary and John would often wonder about them 
 They would often talk about the person and speculate about their life 
 They would imagine what their story was and how they ended up living in a hidden cottage in the forest 
 The years went by and eventually , Mary and John passed away 
 But , their story and the story of the hidden cottage in the forest lived on 
 It was a difficult journey , but ProtagonistA made it through with the support of ProtagonistA's loved ones 
 It had been a long day of work and ProtagonistA was ready to relax 
 It was perfect for the party ProtagonistA was going to next weekend 
 ProtagonistA dreamed of a world where ProtagonistA had unlimited power and could do whatever ProtagonistA wanted 
 ProtagonistA dreamed of a world where ProtagonistA was the most beautiful and the most loved 
 ProtagonistA dreamed of a world where ProtagonistA never had to worry about anything 
Rainbow Dash and Eeyore were laying in bed in the middle of the deserted lake floor , on a warm day in late February , when ProtagonistA came into the room and slid ProtagonistA's hooves over the sheets 
 It 's okay ,  said Rainbow Dash 
  What 's up?I just wanted to say goodbye ,  said ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 'm leaving for good this time 
 What ? Why ?  asked Rainbow Dash 
 ProtagonistA ca n't take it anymore ,  said ProtagonistA 
  This place is just too depressing 
 But what about us ?  asked Eeyore 
 I'm sorry ,  said ProtagonistA 
 A little like a strawberry 
 Pretty , even with a thin layer of frost on top 
 ProtagonistA loved being bad 
 It was everything ProtagonistA 'd ever wanted 
 ProtagonistA had been married for 50 years and had raised four children 
 ProtagonistA had been diagnosed with a terminal illness and given only a few months to live 
 However , there was something about ProtagonistA that made ProtagonistB suspect that ProtagonistA might be up to something 
 ProtagonistB was not the type of person to judge someone based on their appearance , but ProtagonistB could not help but be suspicious of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had met ProtagonistA for the first time a few weeks ago , and ProtagonistA seemed like ProtagonistA was hiding something 
 ProtagonistB was not sure what it was , but ProtagonistB was determined to find out 
 The next time ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB decided to follow ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was not sure what ProtagonistB was looking for , but ProtagonistB was hoping to find some clues 
 ProtagonistB followed ProtagonistA to a bar , and ProtagonistB watched as ProtagonistA talked to a few men 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA was flirting with them , and ProtagonistB was not sure what to think 
 ProtagonistB was about to leave when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA leave with one of the men 
 ProtagonistB followed them to a hotel , and ProtagonistB watched as they went into a room together 
 ProtagonistB was shocked , and ProtagonistB was not sure what to do 
 ProtagonistB was about to call the police when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA leave the room 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA had been up to something , and ProtagonistB was not sure what to do 
 ProtagonistB decided to confront ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA had been up to 
 ProtagonistB was about to call the police when ProtagonistA finally confessed 
 ProtagonistB was shocked , and ProtagonistB did not know what to say 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to get help , and ProtagonistB would not be able to help ProtagonistA anymore 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken , and ProtagonistA begged ProtagonistB to help ProtagonistA 
 However , ProtagonistB was not sure what ProtagonistB could do 
 ProtagonistB did not want to get involved , and ProtagonistB did not want to see ProtagonistA get hurt 
 In the end , ProtagonistB decided to call the police 
 ProtagonistA was taken away , and ProtagonistB never saw ProtagonistA again 
 ProtagonistB was relieved that ProtagonistB had made the right decision , and ProtagonistB was glad that ProtagonistB had not gotten involved 
 At first , ProtagonistA had been excited by the adventure , but now ProtagonistA was just tired 
 In the clearing was a beautiful house 
 It was so beautiful that ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA must be dreaming 
 A kindly - looking woman answered the door 
  Hello , ProtagonistA 
 Welcome to my home 
 Please , come in 
 They were all so beautiful , and they all seemed to be having so much fun 
 The first thing ProtagonistA noticed was the warmth 
 It enveloped ProtagonistA like a blanket , and ProtagonistA sighed in pleasure 
 The second thing was the smell 
 The air was heavy with the scent of flowers and trees , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's head begin to swim 
 Then everything went black 
 They had gone to the beach , the park , and even the mall 
 They had a blast together and ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA had made some new friends 
ProtagonistB did not ask ProtagonistA to do anything , said ProtagonistC , and it was not a question ProtagonistB had thought about thoroughly , much less questioned 
 ProtagonistB was simply going about ProtagonistB's day , doing ProtagonistB's chores and minding ProtagonistB's own business , when ProtagonistB suddenly had the urge to ask ProtagonistA to help ProtagonistB with something 
 It was a small thing , really , but ProtagonistC could tell that it meant a lot to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC knew that ProtagonistC could n't say no , so ProtagonistC agreed 
 It did n't take long for ProtagonistA to realize that helping ProtagonistB was one of the best things ProtagonistA could have ever done 
 It was a beautiful moment that they shared , and ProtagonistA will always cherish it 
 It was a soft , gentle sound that made ProtagonistA feel at peace 
 ProtagonistB had been trying to warn ProtagonistA , to tell ProtagonistA that they were about to cast a spell that would take them to a different world entirely 
 But ProtagonistA had been so caught up in ProtagonistA's own excitement that ProtagonistA had n't heard ProtagonistB 
 And now it was too late 
 It was a faraway island of the northern seas 
 It was a world of quiet and calm seas 
 There were no storms and the weather was always fair 
ProtagonistB watched as ProtagonistA twisted and turned , ProtagonistA's hooves shifting as ProtagonistA tried to keep the position 
 As ProtagonistB watched , ProtagonistB felt a sense of pride welling up inside of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA would be a great dancer one day 
 ProtagonistB was asleep , ProtagonistB's head resting on ProtagonistA's lap 
 It was times like these that ProtagonistA cherished the most 
 Just ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB , spending time together in peace and quiet 
 ProtagonistA was overjoyed at the news , but knew that ProtagonistA would have to give up ProtagonistA's dream of flying 
 ProtagonistA's hair turned from blonde to white and ProtagonistA's eyes became cold and hard 
 The other dolls began to fear ProtagonistA and stay away 
 Even ProtagonistA's owner , who had always loved ProtagonistA , began to feel uneasy around ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA's hooves were shaking , feeling a little dizzy , when suddenly there was nothing but the light of ProtagonistA's tears and the summer air 
  ProtagonistA ,  it called 
  Follow me ,  the horse said 
 The horse looked at ProtagonistA and smiled 
  ProtagonistA 'll find a way ,  it said 
 And with that , the horse disappeared , leaving ProtagonistA alone in the strange world 
 ProtagonistB was watching over ProtagonistA's hooves - a delicate balance , ProtagonistA reasoned , between worry and excitement - and Shining Armor was resting on ProtagonistA's shoulder 
 When ProtagonistA crossed the finish line , ProtagonistA was met with applause from the crowd 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's crew of misfits are just like us 
 They 're always looking for a new adventure , and they 're never afraid to take risks 
 They 're also always there for each other , no matter what 
 Just like us , they 're a family 
 It sounded like someone was coming 
 ProtagonistA had been intrigued by the stories , and by the way ProtagonistB had looked in the photographs 
 ProtagonistB was a beautiful woman , with a kind face 
 ProtagonistB was a woman who had been through a lot , and who had come out the other side 
 It was a beautiful night , and ProtagonistA felt at peace 
 ProtagonistA's parents worked hard to provide for their family and their community 
 They grew crops and raised livestock , and they also hunted and gathered food from the surrounding forest 
 As the years passed , ProtagonistA's parents grew older and they began to rely on ProtagonistA more and more 
 The townspeople were happy and content , and they loved ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA's parents passed away 
 The townspeople helped ProtagonistA as much as they could , but they also had their own families to take care of 
 The townspeople were happy and content , and they continued to live their peaceful lives 
 It took ten years for ProtagonistA to realize what ProtagonistA was really up to , but ProtagonistA knew exactly what ProtagonistA needed to do 
 And , that 's exactly what ProtagonistA did 
 The only thing ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistA had been sent here by ProtagonistB 
  All the history of the kingdom is buried here 
 I had seen ProtagonistA around campus , but I never really talked to ProtagonistA 
 But one day , I saw ProtagonistA walking by ProtagonistA and I decided to talk to ProtagonistA 
 We hit it off immediately and started dating 
 But I soon realized that ProtagonistA was different than I thought ProtagonistA was 
 I tried to break up with ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA threatened to kill me if I ever left ProtagonistA 
 I was scared and did n't know what to do 
 But one day , I mustered up the courage to leave ProtagonistA 
 I have n't seen ProtagonistA since and I hope I never will again 
 It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was enjoying the sunshine 
 The rabbit stopped and watched ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA flew away 
ProtagonistA's eyes were glassy and ProtagonistA's brain had no thoughts 
 ProtagonistA's family was gathered around ProtagonistA , waiting for ProtagonistA to wake up 
 They had been told that ProtagonistA might never wake up , but they refused to give up hope 
 Every day , they would talk to ProtagonistA , telling ProtagonistA about their day and what was going on in the world 
 They would hold ProtagonistA's hand and tell ProtagonistA that they loved ProtagonistA 
 And every day , they would pray for a miracle 
 One day , after months of waiting , ProtagonistA's eyes fluttered open 
 ProtagonistA's family was gathered around ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could see the relief in their eyes 
 ProtagonistA's family leaned in , eager to hear ProtagonistA's first words 
 They all broke down in tears , hugging ProtagonistA and each other 
 It was a miracle 
I am a destitute orphan living in a time of dire need , reduced to a mere child by ProtagonistA 
 My parents died when I was young , leaving me all alone in the world 
 I was taken in by ProtagonistA 
 However , times have been tough lately and ProtagonistA has been forced to take in other orphans to make ends meet 
 I now find myself living in a cramped house with several other children , all of us struggling to get by 
 We are constantly cold and hungry , as ProtagonistA can barely afford to feed us all , let alone keep the house warm 
 I often go to bed with a growling stomach , dreaming of the day when I can finally leave this place and make something of myself 
 One day , I know I 'll escape this life of poverty and make something of myself 
 But for now , I am just a destitute orphan , living in a time of dire need 
ProtagonistB watched as ProtagonistA twisted and turned , ProtagonistA's hooves shifting as ProtagonistA tried to keep the position 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was trying to find the perfect spot to lie down , but it just was n't happening 
 ProtagonistB felt bad for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB also knew that there was nothing ProtagonistB could do 
 ProtagonistB just had to wait it out and hope that ProtagonistA would eventually find a comfortable spot 
Some years ago , I went to see ProtagonistA ; but that name had quite a curious meaning to me , as I had been accustomed to hear ProtagonistA use it when I went into a room where ProtagonistA lived with ProtagonistA's friends and relatives 
 I had never seen ProtagonistA before , and I was very much surprised when ProtagonistA came to the door and asked me my name 
 I told ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA seemed very much pleased 
 The room was full of people , and they all stared at me 
 I felt very awkward , and wished I had not come 
 I was very glad when ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA would take me home 
ProtagonistA's family had never been a particularly close one 
 ProtagonistA's parents had always been wrapped up in their own lives and their own problems and never had much time for ProtagonistA 
 The house where ProtagonistA had lived with ProtagonistA's family had stood empty from the start 
 It was a large , rambling old house that had been in ProtagonistA's family for generations 
 For years , the house stood empty , slowly falling into disrepair 
 The once beautiful gardens were overgrown and the windows were boarded up 
 It was a sad sight 
 But then , one day , a family moved in 
 They were a young couple with two small children 
 They fell in love with the house at first sight and set about restoring it to its former glory 
 It 's like seeing a part of ProtagonistA's childhood come back to life 
 ProtagonistA had been distinguished from ProtagonistA's fellows by some characteristic quality peculiar to the particular kind of river , stream , or other watercourse by which ProtagonistA had been obtained 
  I can see ProtagonistA's future , ProtagonistA 
  I just wanted to let ProtagonistA know that I saw ProtagonistA's future , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was always very supportive of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA to get started in ProtagonistA's career 
 However , ProtagonistB was also very interested in making money , and ProtagonistB often used ProtagonistB's position to get ProtagonistA's help in making money 
 This conflict of interest eventually became a serious problem , and it caused a lot of tension between ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB 
 However , ProtagonistA is still haunted by the conflict of interest with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA is often left wondering if ProtagonistA could have done more with ProtagonistA's life if ProtagonistA had not been so focused on making money 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB had been there for a while 
 Whiskers 
 They looked all around the neighborhood , but they could n't find ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a big hug and went on ProtagonistB's way 
 There were others like ProtagonistA , but they were all hidden away 
  ProtagonistB do n't know why you put up with ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistA 's always been a troublemaker 
  ProtagonistA's mother just sighed and said ,  ProtagonistA 's our daughter , and we love ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been feeling more and more disconnected from the world around ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA just could n't seem to shake it 
 However , when ProtagonistA tried to kill ProtagonistA , something strange happened 
 In that moment , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been wrong about suicide ; it was n't the answer 
 ProtagonistA was rushed to the hospital and was in a coma for weeks 
When ProtagonistA was ten , ProtagonistA was invited to a party 
 When ProtagonistA was fourteen , ProtagonistA was invited to another party 
 So , when ProtagonistB found out that ProtagonistA had been cheating on ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB was not surprised 
 What did surprise ProtagonistB was the lengths ProtagonistA went to keep ProtagonistA's affair a secret 
 When ProtagonistB found out , ProtagonistB was devastated 
 ProtagonistB confronted ProtagonistA and demanded to know why ProtagonistA had done this to ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB was so angry that ProtagonistB tore ProtagonistA's arm off 
 ProtagonistB did n't even care that ProtagonistA was screaming in pain 
 All ProtagonistB cared about was the pain ProtagonistC was going through 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistC would never be able to forgive ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB did n't blame ProtagonistC 
The world is over 
 That 's what ProtagonistA thought as ProtagonistA was thrown out of the castle into the wilds of October 
 ProtagonistA had been murdered , and ProtagonistA had been hoping to be rid of ProtagonistA for a hundred years 
 But today , something was different 
 ProtagonistB , came over to ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA , please get up ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB ca n't leave without ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA up and took ProtagonistA to the ferry 
 ProtagonistB sat ProtagonistA down and gave ProtagonistA a blanket 
  What 's wrong , ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 ProtagonistB stayed with ProtagonistA until the ferry arrived at the other side 
 Then ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA off and took ProtagonistA to the doctor 
 ProtagonistB was being killed in cold blood , right in front of ProtagonistA 
 And in return , they showed ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was not alone 
 They were with ProtagonistA , always 
ProtagonistA was imprisoned no less than twenty - seven times on the Disc of the Dead , and it has been since then that ProtagonistA has been allowed a solitary passage out of ProtagonistA's cell 
 The only thing that keeps ProtagonistA going is the hope that one day ProtagonistA will be able to escape and see the world again 
 One day , after years of waiting , ProtagonistA's chance finally comes 
 ProtagonistA runs and runs until ProtagonistA reaches the edge of the Disc 
 But that did n't stop ProtagonistA from living ProtagonistA's life to the fullest 
 The girl was going on a quest to find a lost treasure 
ProtagonistB would n't trust ProtagonistA , if only ProtagonistA were real 
 ProtagonistB 'd give ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's tongue , said the gleam of ProtagonistA's unicorn horn in ProtagonistB's pearly paling eyes 
 ProtagonistB had been following ProtagonistA for hours , it seemed , and ProtagonistB was getting tired 
 ProtagonistB had been so excited when ProtagonistB first saw ProtagonistA jump down the rabbit hole 
 ProtagonistB was sure that this was an adventure ProtagonistB would never forget 
 But now , ProtagonistB was n't so sure 
 There was a big house , and ProtagonistA had gone inside 
 ProtagonistB had tried to follow , but the door had slammed shut in ProtagonistB's face 
 ProtagonistB had been trying to find a way in ever since 
 ProtagonistB was just about to give up when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA again 
 ProtagonistB approached cautiously 
 ProtagonistB was n't sure if ProtagonistB could trust ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB was curious 
  Where have ProtagonistA been ? ProtagonistB 've been looking for ProtagonistA 
 The rabbit did n't answer 
  ProtagonistB 'm lost 
 ProtagonistB do n't know where ProtagonistB am 
 ProtagonistB was getting frustrated 
 ProtagonistB was about to give up when ProtagonistB saw the gleam in ProtagonistA's eye 
 It was the same gleam ProtagonistB had seen in the unicorn horn 
 ProtagonistA , if ProtagonistA 're real , then help ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB do n't know where ProtagonistB am 
 The rabbit hopped off the mushroom and led ProtagonistB to a door 
 ProtagonistB hesitated 
 ProtagonistB did n't know if ProtagonistB could trust ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistB was tired and lost , and ProtagonistB did n't know what else to do 
 ProtagonistB took a deep breath and stepped through the door 
Slow , steady , and thoughtful , the moment ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's seat at the table , Equestrians moved through the dark and the undulating hall of the palace , picking vixens and lasses out of the crowd and casting them away to dance with the three most beautiful sisters of the Siras Academy 
 ProtagonistB had a kind face and a warm smile , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart flutter in ProtagonistA's chest 
 The music started up , a slow , sensual melody that made ProtagonistA's skin prick with goosebumps 
 The Equestrians began to move , their hips undulating in time with the music 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA's hand and led ProtagonistA onto the dance floor 
 ProtagonistA was lost in the moment , and ProtagonistA did n't want it to end 
The House of Parliament , in the house of the Lords , had passed an act , which ProtagonistA expressly reserved to ProtagonistA , for a certain purposes , and without any previous consent of ProtagonistA , which provided , that the title of ProtagonistA , for the whole period that ProtagonistA was under the age of eighteen years , should be , and was hereby , vested in the Crown 
 ProtagonistA was determined to fight it and to get ProtagonistA's title back 
 In the end , they overturned the act and restored ProtagonistA's title to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's heart was pounding in ProtagonistA's chest and ProtagonistA could feel the warm blood running down ProtagonistA's throat 
 ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistA's family and friends and how much ProtagonistA was going to miss them 
 Then everything went black 
It was a cold , winter morning and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were walking to school 
 ProtagonistB was carrying ProtagonistA's heavy backpack for ProtagonistA 
 They were two blocks from the school door and three blocks from the flat that always seemed to be the last place to put ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA went to sleep 
 ProtagonistB was tired and ProtagonistA's daughter could see it in ProtagonistB's eyes 
  ProtagonistB think ProtagonistA should ,  ProtagonistB replied 
 ProtagonistA always felt like an outsider , like ProtagonistA was just going through the motions 
 They were discussing ProtagonistA's ministry and how ProtagonistA was helping people through ProtagonistA's work at the temple 
 The other woman told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was doing God 's work , and that ProtagonistA was making a difference in the world 
 This experience made ProtagonistA realize that ProtagonistA had been suppressing ProtagonistA's own sense of history 
 ProtagonistA pointed up at a bright light and said to the sailors of the Thames ,  ProtagonistA 've got a comet !  The sailors all looked up and saw the comet , too 
 They started to make wishes on it , and ProtagonistA wished for a great adventure 
ProtagonistA's family was devastated when ProtagonistA was killed 
 ProtagonistA's six daughters were left to fend for themselves 
 Two of ProtagonistA's daughters were known to the world , and two were known only to ProtagonistA's friends and family 
 The girls were lost without ProtagonistA 
 They struggled to make ends meet and to find their place in the world 
 But they did it , together 
 And they knew that ProtagonistA would be proud of them 
 The door opened and ProtagonistA walked through 
 The flowers were glittering with the colors of magic 
 ProtagonistB was holding a lantern and ProtagonistB looked very old 
  ProtagonistB am the keeper of this garden ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB have been waiting for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB have been waiting for a very long time 
 ProtagonistB was very old and looked like ProtagonistB was about to die 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was the Emperor of the Day , and according to the law of physics , ProtagonistB was going to die in the year 5802 
 ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA the title of Emperor , and this made ProtagonistA powerful 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase 
 ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was going somewhere important 
I first met ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA was nineteen years old and ProtagonistA was working as a dressmaker in the East End of London 
 I was immediately struck by ProtagonistA's beauty and ProtagonistA's kindness 
 We became friends quickly , and I soon learned that ProtagonistA was one of the most talented dressmakers in the city 
 But , even though ProtagonistA is gone , ProtagonistA's memory continues to live on in the hearts of those who knew ProtagonistA 
 However , it was clear the man had been murdered in some strange way 
ProtagonistB had been battling ovarian cancer for years , and ProtagonistA had been by ProtagonistB's side every step of the way 
 But the cancer had finally taken ProtagonistB's life , and ProtagonistA was left feeling lost and alone 
 And it was during that night that ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's first dream 
 ProtagonistB was smiling and ProtagonistB looked happy and at peace 
 Even an assassination attempt in the capital would be unlikely 
 Oh , ProtagonistB know it 's a bad idea 
 It just seems so final , you know ? Like ProtagonistA 'm giving up on everything 
 And besides , ProtagonistA know it 's the right thing to do 
It is a month of extreme hardship for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA can not possibly be surprised by the scene which I have set before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB's body is lying in state in the great hall of the castle , and ProtagonistA is weeping over it 
 All of ProtagonistB's belongings have been taken away , and ProtagonistA is the only one who has been left to mourn ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA is not surprised by the scene , but ProtagonistA is saddened by it 
 The owners of the casinos got wind of who ProtagonistA was and started banning ProtagonistA from their establishments 
 But ProtagonistA's luck eventually ran out 
 ProtagonistA lost everything ProtagonistA had and then some 
 It was a slippery slope from there 
 ProtagonistA ended up alone and penniless , ProtagonistA's once - great skills nothing but a memory 
 ProtagonistA had been warned about the customs of the land , and was not about to take any chances 
 It was ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA's left arm crossed over ProtagonistA's chest , as though ProtagonistA were about to slide into oblivion 
 Then , ProtagonistA was released and had to recover at home 
 However , on the tenth day , ProtagonistA's fever began to subside and ProtagonistA started to feel better again 
 There was something about ProtagonistB's presence that was comforting 
 ProtagonistB sat down next to ProtagonistA and they watched the fire together in silence 
 The pony was lying in the middle of the valley , and it was clear that it had been there for some time 
 ProtagonistA was brought up in an atmosphere of luxury and refinement , but ProtagonistA was not content to live a life of idleness and ease 
 ProtagonistA was wounded in the battle of Waterloo , and returned to England a hero 
 ProtagonistA was hailed as a national heroine , and ProtagonistA's name was on everyone 's lips 
ProtagonistA's eighteenth year was the best year of ProtagonistA's life 
 They traveled all over the world , and they had the time of their lives 
 Every day was a new adventure , and they just could n't get enough of each other 
 They were truly in love 
 However , all good things must come to an end , and eventually they had to return home 
 They were both sad to leave their magical honeymoon behind , but they knew that they had to get back to reality 
 Even though they 're no longer on their honeymoon , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB's 's love for each other is stronger than ever 
 They cherish all of the memories they made on their honeymoon , and they know that they 'll never forget it 
 It was truly the best year of their lives 
 ProtagonistA 's content to stay right where ProtagonistA is , surrounded by ProtagonistA's friends and family 
 Unfortunately , the plane landed safely in New York and ProtagonistA was still alive 
 It was a nice enough book , but ProtagonistA did n't really understand it and ProtagonistA got bored quickly 
 ProtagonistA was relieved when it was over and ProtagonistA could move on to something else 
 ProtagonistB had a top hat of ProtagonistB's own , which ProtagonistB was holding in ProtagonistB's hands 
 ProtagonistB was looking at ProtagonistA with a strange expression on ProtagonistB's face 
 I'm looking at ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Why are ProtagonistB here?I'm here to help ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 You're in danger ,  ProtagonistB said 
  What 's going to happen to me?I ca n't tell ProtagonistA that ,  ProtagonistB said 
 Well ProtagonistB 've done well indeed ,  said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA sat down next to ProtagonistB , looking up at the heavens above them with a kind of dislike and a kind of curiosity 
  ProtagonistB 've managed to find the only spot on this entire planet that is n't covered in pollution 
 I know ,  said ProtagonistB ,  but it was n't easy 
 It took ProtagonistB years to find this place 
 And now that ProtagonistB have , what are ProtagonistB going to do with it?I'm going to live here ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm going to build a house and live off the land 
 No , ProtagonistB 'm not ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm going to be happy 
 ProtagonistA was born in the year of King Henry I 's coronation and ProtagonistA made a huge contribution to the prosperity of London during ProtagonistA's 16 years there 
ProtagonistA was locked up in a small room with no windows and only one door 
 The door was locked from the outside 
 The file was for a divorce case and ProtagonistA was supposed to find any assets that the husband may have hidden from the wife 
 ProtagonistA's life is not easy , but ProtagonistA does not complain 
The sun sat on its apex and its smooth black slopes in a land of full greenness , with the summer air of a land of promise and promise 's bustle and its promise , the promise of the stars and the promise of the earth itself , a land where there was no sin and no hate nor any fear , where there was no man 's fault and no man 's fault 's fault , where there was no bad behavior nor any bad habit nor any bad character , where there was no evil in the eyes of ProtagonistA , where there was no evil that should escape ProtagonistA , nor any evil that should escape ProtagonistA , nor any evil or bad spirit , no Lord , no God , no God nor any spirit , near ProtagonistA or in ProtagonistA's name , or any thing that is not in ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB 'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but we 're going to have to let ProtagonistA go 
 We just ca n't afford to keep ProtagonistA on any longer 
  ProtagonistB 'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB 'm going to have to let ProtagonistA go , too 
 We just ca n't afford to keep ProtagonistA on any longer 
 Alban 's , and had seen the king 's tomb , and that it was very grand 
 The scientist had been working on his theory for years , and the ear had been listening to the stories of the planets for just as long 
 But the spectator , who had only just arrived , was the one who finally saw the truth 
 ProtagonistB , looked at ProtagonistA with a confused expression 
  Can ProtagonistB help ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked 
  ProtagonistB 'm sorry , we do n't offer that service ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But ProtagonistB can give ProtagonistA a list of people who might be able to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was determined to find a runner who could help ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA would find one on the list 
ProtagonistB discovered the existence of the world in a paper which was stuck on the back of ProtagonistA's desk , and which ProtagonistA picked up and read from time to time 
 ProtagonistB was fascinated by the thought of other people living in different places and having different experiences 
 ProtagonistB read about the different cultures and customs , and the different ways of life 
 ProtagonistB also read about the different religions and the different beliefs 
 ProtagonistB was particularly interested in the idea of reincarnation , and ProtagonistB read about it in the paper 
 ProtagonistA's only possessions were the clothes on ProtagonistA's back and the few tools ProtagonistA used to help ProtagonistA's neighbors 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was getting married to ProtagonistB's second cousin , the Empress , and ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's blessing 
 ProtagonistA's friends would joke that ProtagonistA must have a coffee IV , and they were n't far from the truth 
 It was ProtagonistA's happy place 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was out testing ProtagonistA's latest invention , a storm rolled in 
 ProtagonistA was caught in the middle of the pond , with no way to get to shore 
 ProtagonistA 's even won a few awards for it 
 ProtagonistA was terrified and ran as fast as ProtagonistA could in the opposite direction 
 ProtagonistA was exhausted and out of breath 
 ProtagonistB ProtagonistB was walking towards ProtagonistA with a gun in ProtagonistB's hand 
 ProtagonistA was frozen with fear 
 In ProtagonistA's nightmares , ProtagonistA was being chased by an unknown assailant 
 ProtagonistA was trapped in ProtagonistA's apartment with whatever was causing ProtagonistA's nightmares 
ProtagonistB was smiling when ProtagonistA said to ProtagonistC , ProtagonistA would like to introduce ProtagonistA to Cadence 
 ProtagonistB had been worried that ProtagonistA was becoming too isolated and that ProtagonistA would never find true friends 
 But now it seemed like everything was going to be alright 
 It had been two years since ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was worried about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC looked just like ProtagonistB 
 Do ProtagonistC know her?The woman looked at ProtagonistA for a moment , and then ProtagonistC smiled 
  Yes , ProtagonistC know ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB 's ProtagonistC's daughter 
 They hugged each other and cried , and then they went back to ProtagonistC's house to catch up on all the news 
It was the first day of spring in the year of ProtagonistA's coronation , and ProtagonistB was up at the royal court to welcome ProtagonistA to the throne ; but the weather had already turned hot and dry and the first - born were already starting to be gone 
 The court was in an uproar , with many of the lords and ladies already planning to leave for their summer homes 
 ProtagonistB was one of the few who remained , and ProtagonistB was determined to make the most of it 
 ProtagonistA was crowned that day , and ProtagonistB was there to witness it 
 ProtagonistB cheered along with the rest of the court , and even managed to get a glimpse of ProtagonistA 
 However , the hot weather continued , and by the end of the week , most of the court had deserted ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was one of the few who remained , and ProtagonistB vowed to stand by ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was a great comfort to ProtagonistA during ProtagonistA's early days as ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB was always there to lend a listening ear or offer advice 
 The hot weather eventually broke , and the court returned to normal 
 ProtagonistA's reign was a long and successful one , and ProtagonistB was always there by ProtagonistA's side 
The sun was setting on the day that ProtagonistB called ProtagonistA to understand that ProtagonistA had overshot ProtagonistA's task 
 ProtagonistA 're supposed to be cleaning the windows , not the whole house 
  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB do , but ProtagonistA 've gone too far 
 ProtagonistB 'll have to ask ProtagonistA to leave 
  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry 
 ProtagonistA reached out to grab it , but it was too fast and it got away 
The empty oven still hurt ProtagonistA's eyes when ProtagonistA stood over the brim 
 It was a reminder of all ProtagonistA had lost in the fire 
 ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA's family , ProtagonistA's life 
 The rat had been in ProtagonistA's house for days , and ProtagonistA had been trying to catch it 
 But every time ProtagonistA got close , the rat would run away 
 The servant who lived in the house next door to ProtagonistA woke up the neighbor who lived in the house next door to ProtagonistA 
 The neighbor came over , and they both tried to calm ProtagonistA down 
 Finally , the neighbor called the police 
 The police came and took ProtagonistA away 
 They took ProtagonistA to the hospital 
 The doctors at the hospital said that ProtagonistA was howling because ProtagonistA was crazy 
 They said that ProtagonistA needed to be in a mental hospital 
 And so , ProtagonistA was taken to a mental hospital 
 ProtagonistB was always late , never had any money , and was always making excuses 
 But ProtagonistA was blinded by love , or so ProtagonistA thought 
 That was the final straw 
Once upon a time there was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was sitting in the kitchen of ProtagonistB's mother 's house , staring up at the ceiling where magnificent paintings of the gods held the key to the universe 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistB heard a noise downstairs 
 It sounded like someone was coming up the stairs 
 ProtagonistB got up quietly and went to the top of the stairs to see who it was 
 It was ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry to just show up like this , but ProtagonistA need a place to stay 
 ProtagonistA's parents kicked ProtagonistA out 
 ProtagonistB felt sorry for ProtagonistA and welcomed ProtagonistA into the house 
 ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA to a room where ProtagonistA could stay and promised to keep ProtagonistA safe 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was going to be a part of ProtagonistB's life forever 
There was once ProtagonistA ; ProtagonistA was named John 
 People started to recognize ProtagonistA as the author of some of the best stories they had ever read 
 ProtagonistA had been caught in lies before , and ProtagonistA knew that this time , ProtagonistA would be caught again 
 ProtagonistB was the only one who could help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been caught stealing from the local grocery store 
 But ProtagonistB did n't say anything , and ProtagonistB agreed to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was relieved , and ProtagonistA was grateful to ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's help 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken , and ProtagonistA would never trust ProtagonistB again 
 At first ProtagonistA just thought of ProtagonistB as a friend , but soon ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA was in love 
 The door was shut , but a light burned within , and ProtagonistA could hear the sound of voices raised in song 
 It was a small , intimate service , and ProtagonistA felt immediately at home 
 The congregation was made up of people of all ages , from young children to elders , and they were all singing with such feeling and joy that ProtagonistA was soon caught up in the spirit of the moment and singing along with them 
 They had a pleasant conversation , and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA telling ProtagonistC about ProtagonistA's life and how ProtagonistA had come to be in ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC was a kind man , and ProtagonistC listened to ProtagonistA's story with interest 
 When ProtagonistA had finished , ProtagonistC smiled and took ProtagonistA's hand 
 Welcome , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said 
 ProtagonistC hope ProtagonistA 'll come back again 
 As ProtagonistA walked back out into the night , ProtagonistA felt warmed by the experience and the welcome ProtagonistA had received 
There was ProtagonistA 
 They talked for hours and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had finally found ProtagonistA's soulmate 
 They exchanged numbers and went their separate ways 
 A few weeks later , they met up again and this time , they got married 
 They had a beautiful wedding and they lived happily ever after 
 It turns out ProtagonistA was n't joking at all 
 ProtagonistA really did steal them ! I was so upset when I found out 
 I did n't know what to do 
 I was so worried about my sisters 
 I did n't know if they were okay or not 
 I was so mad at ProtagonistA 
 I wanted to confront ProtagonistA and ask ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA did it , but I was too scared 
 I did n't know what ProtagonistA would do to me if I did that 
 I was so confused and scared 
 I did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was born into a royal family and had a very privileged life 
 There was a group of women there who were all chatting and laughing together 
 They were all very beautiful and they were all wearing the most exquisite dresses 
 Suddenly , one of the women turned to ProtagonistA and said ,  ProtagonistA , it has come to pass in heaven that there is ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was stunned 
 The woman said ,  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA have been chosen to receive the gift of knowledge 
 This knowledge will be a great asset to ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled 
 Thank you , Your Majesty , ProtagonistA thought , for this wonderful gift 
 They talked all night and ended up exchanging numbers 
 They 've been dating ever since 
 ProtagonistA had been forced to fend for ProtagonistA , and had become quite adept at it 
 Standing beside ProtagonistA was ProtagonistA's faithful companion , a wolf who had been with ProtagonistA through thick and thin 
 Together , they would rebuild ProtagonistA's home and make it even better than before 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how it had led ProtagonistA to this moment 
 The road had come to a sudden end , and there was nothing but a cold , dead end ahead of ProtagonistA 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 In the center of the clearing was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was huddled in a ball , crying ProtagonistB's eyes out 
  ProtagonistA 'm here now , and ProtagonistA wo n't let anything happen to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB stopped crying and looked at ProtagonistA with gratitude 
 ProtagonistB was still weak , but ProtagonistB was able to walk on ProtagonistB's own 
 The cat said ,  ProtagonistA are in Wonderland 
 Now , it was time to put ProtagonistA's plan into action 
 As a diversion , they would create a commotion while ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's escape 
 ProtagonistA's last thought was that ProtagonistA did n't even dream that this would happen to ProtagonistA 
 The first was a description of a dream in which ProtagonistB had been visited by an angel , who had told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistC was in heaven and that ProtagonistB would soon join ProtagonistC there 
 The second was a dream in which ProtagonistB had been transported to a beautiful garden , where ProtagonistB had been given a flower by a stranger 
 ProtagonistA's fame spread far and wide , and ProtagonistA began to attract a following of people who believed in ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's followers began to call ProtagonistA the  Queen of Dreams 
 ProtagonistA's movement continued to grow , and ProtagonistA began to gain political power 
 ProtagonistA's movement continued to grow , and ProtagonistA became one of the most influential people in England 
 ProtagonistA is remembered as one of the most important figures in English history 
 ProtagonistA had been warned by ProtagonistA's parents not to stray too far from home , for the city was a dangerous place for a young girl 
 The streets were narrower here , and the buildings seemed to lean in towards each other 
 They were laughing and jeering , and in the center of the circle was ProtagonistB , cowering on the ground 
 ProtagonistA's heart went out to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA rushed forward to help ProtagonistB 
 The boys were mocking ProtagonistB and throwing stones at ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was horrified 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with gratitude in ProtagonistB's eyes 
  Thank ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Those boys have been tormenting ProtagonistB for days 
 ProtagonistB 'm so glad ProtagonistA came along 
 The boys had seen ProtagonistA talking to ProtagonistB and were coming back to finish the job 
 ProtagonistA sent ProtagonistB a card that read : Beg for ProtagonistB's help 
 ProtagonistB was shocked and disappointed 
 ProtagonistB had hoped ProtagonistA would grow up to be a great man , but it seemed ProtagonistA was nothing more than a beggar 
 That 's impossible , Rarity , ProtagonistA said , that 's impossible , even for great magic ! 
Ever since the day ProtagonistA was born , ProtagonistA has asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was really made of , and yet always comes away with the same conclusion : ProtagonistA is a very odd little thing indeed ! Even ProtagonistA's parents do n't know what to make of ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's constant questioning 
 They 've tried their best to answer ProtagonistA's questions , but they always seem to fall short 
 unique than most 
 ProtagonistA 's even asked ProtagonistA's parents if ProtagonistA was made in a laboratory!Needless to say , ProtagonistA's parents are at their wit 's end 
 They love ProtagonistA , but they just do n't know how to deal with ProtagonistA's never - ending questions 
 They 've tried their best to answer ProtagonistA , but they always seem to come up short 
 One day , ProtagonistA's parents sit ProtagonistA down and tell ProtagonistA that they 're going to send ProtagonistA to a special school 
 A school for children like ProtagonistA 
 So off ProtagonistA goes to the school , and for the first time in ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA belongs 
 ProtagonistB was also waiting for the bus , and ProtagonistA could tell ProtagonistB was getting just as impatient as ProtagonistA was 
 Finally , the bus arrived , and they both got on 
 But as they were getting on , ProtagonistB bumped into ProtagonistA and knocked ProtagonistA down 
 Can ProtagonistB help me?Of course , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'll get ProtagonistB's crew ready and we 'll be out of here in no time 
 They parted ways , but promised to help each other again if needed 
 It was a simple plan , really 
 Go to the old abandoned house on the edge of town , find the key hidden under the doormat , and let ProtagonistA in 
 It sounded easy enough , but ProtagonistA knew that there was always more to a plan than what was on the surface 
 After all , ProtagonistA had been given the best horse in the stable and ProtagonistA was the best rider 
 ProtagonistA's friends rushed to ProtagonistA's side , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistA was gone 
ProtagonistA's summer vacation had taken ProtagonistA halfway around the world , and by this time ProtagonistA was beginning to get tired of these ridiculously long journeys 
 ProtagonistA had been gone for two months , and ProtagonistA was starting to miss ProtagonistA's family and friends 
 But the police did n't believe ProtagonistA 
 They said the evidence was all there , plain as day 
 The police did n't believe ProtagonistA 
 They said ProtagonistA was a liar 
 They said ProtagonistA was a cold - blooded killer 
 They said ProtagonistA was a monster 
 The jury did n't believe ProtagonistA 
 They said ProtagonistA was guilty 
 They said ProtagonistA was a killer 
 They said ProtagonistA was a monster 
 ProtagonistB did n't believe ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA was guilty 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA was a killer 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA was a monster 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA was a cold - blooded killer 
 All the powers of Europe had shared in the victory , and ProtagonistA was eager to promote ProtagonistA's empire 
On the summer day that ProtagonistA was born , ProtagonistA , with a weakling 's mind and thin frame , was drowned 
 The doctors said that it was a miracle that ProtagonistA had survived for as long as ProtagonistA had 
 ProtagonistA's parents were devastated 
 They had wanted a healthy baby so badly 
 When ProtagonistA was born , they had been so happy 
 But now , their happiness was gone 
It was not long ago when ProtagonistA first visited the forest 
 The horses were very friendly and allowed ProtagonistA to pet them 
 It was a very magical experience 
 ProtagonistB was the only one who ever stood up for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB was always there to help ProtagonistA out 
  Just leave ProtagonistA alone , please 
 ProtagonistA had to know who ProtagonistA could trust and who ProtagonistA could n't , what was safe and what was n't 
 ProtagonistB was lurking in the shadows , and ProtagonistB looked shifty 
 ProtagonistB was tall and thin , with a long , hooked nose 
 ProtagonistB grinned at ProtagonistA , revealing yellowed teeth 
 Yes , ProtagonistA can help ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm looking for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's name is Alice 
  What do ProtagonistB want with her?I have a message for ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  From ProtagonistA's father 
 ProtagonistA's father had been dead for years 
  ProtagonistA's father is dead 
 The man 's smile faded 
 ProtagonistB's eyes turned cold 
 I do n't have time for this ,  ProtagonistB said 
  If ProtagonistA see ProtagonistA , tell ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA's father is waiting for ProtagonistA 
 And tell ProtagonistA to come alone 
 With that , ProtagonistB turned and walked away 
 The port was very busy with a strong trading post and ProtagonistA was amazed at all the activity 
 A historian , a naturalist , a sculptor , and racing horses were among them 
 The ladies standing on the hill were the only ones who were not looking at ProtagonistA 
 Are ProtagonistA okay ?  ProtagonistB asked with a worried look on ProtagonistB's face 
  ProtagonistA 'm fine , ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB nodded and went back to bed 
 The snake slashed ProtagonistA's leg , severing a lot of flesh and leaving ProtagonistA with one leg 
 The driver took ProtagonistA to the nearest hospital where ProtagonistA was treated for ProtagonistA's injuries 
 It was a familiar feeling to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB agreed , and they mowed the grass together 
Near the end of the last century , it may be , there came as a terrible surprise to ProtagonistA , that from the first days of the world until the end of the last , ProtagonistA had not been able to reckon with one hundred and fifty millions of years 
It was a beautiful day outside , and ProtagonistA was feeling good 
 The man explained that they were going to re - enact the moment when ProtagonistB was first lodged in the Boston house 
 ProtagonistA was intrigued and decided to watch 
 The group went through the motions of the event , and ProtagonistA was impressed by their dedication 
You 're gon na eat ProtagonistA , said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA lay down on the sand , but do n't kill ProtagonistA 
 The sun was setting and the waves were crashing and ProtagonistA was getting hungry 
 ProtagonistA had been stranded on this deserted island for days now , and ProtagonistA was starting to get desperate 
 ProtagonistB was a ProtagonistA was terrified 
 ProtagonistB caught up to ProtagonistA and knocked ProtagonistA to the ground 
 I'm not going to eat ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm lost too 
 ProtagonistB 've been wandering around this island for days , looking for food 
 ProtagonistB 'm so hungry ProtagonistB ca n't think straight 
  If we work together , we 're sure to find food 
 The bear nodded in agreement 
 They found some berries and nuts , which sustained them , but they were both still very hungry 
 One day , they came across a cave 
 They went inside and found a feast ! There was fruit , bread , and even some cooked meat 
 They ate until they were stuffed and then went back outside 
 Thank ProtagonistA for teaming up with ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm glad we found food , but ProtagonistB 'm even more glad we found each other 
 When ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistA started to remember all the good times they had together and it helped ProtagonistA to feel better 
ProtagonistC died 
 ProtagonistA 'm so sorry , ProtagonistB 
 It was an accident 
 ProtagonistA 'm so sorry 
 ProtagonistA 'm so sorry 
 The book was full of corrections and revisions , but ProtagonistA did n't mind 
 There , in the middle of the page , was a picture of ProtagonistA's own face 
 The book said that ProtagonistA was the final victim of the series 
 ProtagonistA's heart raced as ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was in for the scare of ProtagonistA's life 
 It was n't until ProtagonistA was finished with ProtagonistA's own breakfast and about to get up to leave that ProtagonistA realized the dish next to ProtagonistA was still full of food 
 ProtagonistA's parents had been at their wit 's end with ProtagonistA 
 They had tried everything they could think of , but nothing had worked 
 Finally , they had decided to send ProtagonistA to therapy 
 ProtagonistA's parents were proud of ProtagonistA and so was ProtagonistA 
 The droplet bobbed down and out of the bush , and ProtagonistA followed it 
 The droplet led ProtagonistA to a secret door in the palace that ProtagonistA had never seen before 
 The droplet jumped into the fountain and ProtagonistA followed 
 ProtagonistA was so shocked and appalled by it that ProtagonistA cried out ,  Wait , that 's a new plot !  ProtagonistB had outdone ProtagonistB this time , and ProtagonistA was determined to stop ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB just laughed and said that ProtagonistB loved to see the look on ProtagonistA's face when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had been outsmarted 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was just too predictable and that it was time for ProtagonistA to learn a lesson 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA , is that really ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB said , as ProtagonistB got closer 
 ProtagonistB was in the neighborhood and thought ProtagonistB 'd stop by to say hi 
 ProtagonistB 'm sorry ProtagonistB have n't been in touch , but ProtagonistB 've been really busy 
 I understand 
 But it 's so good to see you!They chatted for a while , catching up on old times 
 It was like no time had passed at all 
 I should go ,  ProtagonistB said finally 
  But it was great to see ProtagonistA 
 We should keep in touch this time 
 They said their goodbyes and ProtagonistB walked away 
 It was nice to have old friends back in ProtagonistA's life 
 Almost two years old 
 It was scary to think about losing ProtagonistA's mind , but ProtagonistA knew it was a possibility 
 It was a beautiful day outside , and ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit excited 
 It felt good to be alive 
 It was going to be a good day 
There she is , said ProtagonistA after looking at the chart in ProtagonistA's hands 
 According to the map , the island was uninhabited 
 They had been searching for weeks and were getting tired 
 But this was the last clue , so they had to find the island 
 They got on their boat and started to row 
 It took them all day , but eventually they made it to the island 
 They got off the boat and started to look around 
 There was n't much to see 
 There was a small beach and some trees 
 But there was no treasure 
 ProtagonistA's friends were getting angry 
 They started to argue with each other 
 And that 's when ProtagonistA saw it 
 There was a small hole in the ground 
 Inside the chest was the treasure they had been looking for 
 ProtagonistA's eyes widened in shock and ProtagonistA stared at ProtagonistB , wondering if ProtagonistB was awake 
 There were two men behind a counter , and the one on the right handed ProtagonistA a stack of papers 
 ProtagonistA , do n't know what else to say ,  said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA took the stack of papers from the man on the right 
 ProtagonistA leafed through them , not really sure what ProtagonistA was looking for 
 It 's the paperwork for the divorce ,  the man said , matter - of - factly 
 ProtagonistA's heart sank 
 But here it was , in black and white 
 No , that 's it 
 ProtagonistA can go now ,  the man said 
 ProtagonistA turned and walked away , the papers clutched in ProtagonistA's hand 
 ProtagonistA's life as ProtagonistA knew it was over 
 ProtagonistB , said that ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's husband were stranded in the area and were looking for a place to stay for the night 
 ProtagonistB asked if ProtagonistA knew of any farms or houses in the area that might be able to help them out 
 As they walked , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA about ProtagonistA's life and what ProtagonistA liked to do 
 ProtagonistB was very interested in everything ProtagonistA had to say 
 When they arrived at the farmhouse , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to come inside and meet ProtagonistB's husband 
 ProtagonistB was a very friendly man , and ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's wife made ProtagonistA feel right at home 
 They offered ProtagonistA a drink and some food , and ProtagonistA accepted 
 As ProtagonistA was about to leave , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA would like to come and visit them sometime 
 ProtagonistB had been wounded in battle and ProtagonistA was taking ProtagonistB home 
 ProtagonistA was relieved to be home , but ProtagonistA was also worried about ProtagonistB 
 There was a bright flash of light and then ProtagonistA was gone 
 I told ProtagonistA I would join ProtagonistA 
 We ran for about an hour and then we stopped to get some water 
 We were both sweating and out of breath 
 We sat down on the curb and rested for a few minutes 
 It was a beautiful day and I was happy to be spending it with ProtagonistA 
 We talked and laughed as we sat there in the sun 
 I knew I was falling for ProtagonistA 
 Eventually , we got up and started running again 
 We ran all the way back to ProtagonistA's house 
 When we got there , we were both exhausted 
 We said goodbye and I went home 
 I could n't stop thinking about ProtagonistA 
 I was falling in love with ProtagonistA 
 I knew I had to tell ProtagonistA 
 The next day , I went over to ProtagonistA's house and told ProtagonistA how I felt 
 We hugged and kissed and we 've been together ever since 
ProtagonistA was standing before ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA's hair aflame 
 ProtagonistB was standing in the middle of the path , and ProtagonistB was holding a lantern 
 ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was waiting for someone 
 When ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB smiled and held out ProtagonistB's hand 
  Hello , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 've been waiting for ProtagonistA 
 It had been acting strange lately , and ProtagonistA was worried 
 The last time it had erupted , it had destroyed ProtagonistA's home and killed ProtagonistA's family 
 The volcano was getting ready to blow 
 It was too late 
 The volcano blew , and ProtagonistA was killed in the explosion 
It was a hot February day in the year 1826 , when ProtagonistA lay the body of ProtagonistB , to the sad and uncharitable 
 ProtagonistB had been struck down by a sudden illness and had died within days 
 But it was n't and now ProtagonistB was gone 
 The funeral was a small and somber affair 
 There were only a few people there to pay their respects and ProtagonistA felt so alone 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to meet ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would be able to provide ProtagonistA with a fine meal 
 ProtagonistB was very handsome and ProtagonistB's garden was exquisite 
 They had a wonderful time together and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would always remember this day 
 The light played over ProtagonistA's features and ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's head towards the sun , eyes half - lidded in pleasure 
 This was ProtagonistA's favorite spot on the island , where ProtagonistA could sit and watch the waves crash against the rocks , and the seagulls wheel and cry 
 It was a place of peace and solitude , and ProtagonistA cherished it 
 It was early summer and the days were long and lazy 
 ProtagonistB was tall and handsome , and ProtagonistB had a kind face 
 ProtagonistA felt drawn to ProtagonistB and they began talking 
 ProtagonistB's name was William and ProtagonistB was a gentleman 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had come to the park to find a wife 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had been looking for a young lady who was beautiful , intelligent , and kind 
 When ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB had found ProtagonistB's perfect match 
 They began courting and soon they were married 
 They were very happy together and they had a beautiful life 
 Inside were eleven miniature people , each no bigger than ProtagonistA's thumb 
 They were all fast asleep 
 ProtagonistB stirred and opened ProtagonistB's eyes 
 ProtagonistB was no bigger than a grain of rice 
 Seeing ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB let out a cry of alarm and scrambled to hide behind a blade of grass 
 The other ten woke up and followed suit 
 After a few minutes , they seemed to have calmed down and began to explore their new surroundings 
 These little people were so full of life and curiosity 
  That 's amazing !  ProtagonistA's friend said 
  I 'm so happy for ProtagonistA !  
 So , when ProtagonistA's mother took ProtagonistA to dinner and asked ProtagonistA whether ProtagonistA would like a dog , ProtagonistA was ecstatic 
 ProtagonistA immediately said yes and they went to pick out ProtagonistB that very night 
 ProtagonistB was the perfect dog and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly 
 ProtagonistA's wanderlust had led ProtagonistA to many different places and ProtagonistA had made many friends along the way 
 However , ProtagonistA's appearance sometimes caused consternation among ProtagonistA's fellow travellers 
 ProtagonistA was known throughout the city for ProtagonistA's beauty and ProtagonistA's charm 
 And , as is usual with them , ProtagonistA's father was a king 
 The rabbit was very scared and it ran away 
 In the garden there was a big house 
 They were all very happy and they were singing and dancing 
Two weeks ago , in the town on the Mississippi , there lived ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's name was John , and ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's wife 
 They had been married for ten years , and they had two children 
 They were both happy with their life , but they both wanted something more 
 ProtagonistB was shocked , and ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to think about it for a week 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB did not want to make any decisions right away 
 ProtagonistB was heartbroken , but ProtagonistB knew that there was nothing ProtagonistB could do 
 ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA ProtagonistA's divorce papers , and ProtagonistB watched ProtagonistA leave ProtagonistB's life 
 ProtagonistB was sad , but ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB had to move on 
 The sun was shining so bright that it felt like it was burning ProtagonistA's eyes 
 Fall was ProtagonistA's favorite time of year , and ProtagonistA loved nothing more than to sit in ProtagonistA's room and watch the leaves change color 
 It sounded like thunder , but ProtagonistA knew it could n't be 
 The sky was clear and there was n't a cloud in sight 
 But all ProtagonistA saw was a large , white rabbit running around in circles 
 It was the strangest thing ProtagonistA had ever seen 
 There was no other explanation for what ProtagonistA had just seen 
 The rabbit was gone , but ProtagonistA could hear it running around in the bushes 
 It was the same rabbit ProtagonistA had seen before , but it was now lying on its back with its legs in the air 
 It was a lot of money , but ProtagonistA did n't mind 
 The first time ProtagonistA saw the phoenix , ProtagonistA was mesmerized 
 ProtagonistB stared back at ProtagonistA and then ProtagonistB smiled 
 I'm John ,  ProtagonistB replied 
 It was a fitful , restless sleep , and ProtagonistA's dreams were filled with images of ProtagonistA's loved ones dying 
 One by one , they all vanished , until ProtagonistA was the only one left 
 The sun was streaming in through the window , and ProtagonistA could hear the birds singing outside 
 It was a beautiful day , but ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA's heart had been ripped out 
 ProtagonistA was covered in dirt and ProtagonistA's clothes were ripped and tattered 
 ProtagonistA's hair was matted and ProtagonistA had bruises all over ProtagonistA's body 
 ProtagonistB watches ProtagonistA for a few moments before clearing ProtagonistB's throat to get ProtagonistA's attention 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistB 
 It 's okay , ProtagonistA 
 Just do n't stay up here by ProtagonistA too long , okay?I wo n't , ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA promise 
 ProtagonistA is so absorbed in the story that ProtagonistA does not hear ProtagonistA's father come in a few minutes later 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA were up here reading by ProtagonistA 
 Is everything okay?Alice looks up at ProtagonistA's father , a little sheepish 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , dad 
 It 's okay , ProtagonistA 
 Just do n't stay up here by ProtagonistA for too long , all right?I wo n't , dad 
 ProtagonistA promise 
 What are ProtagonistA doing up here by ProtagonistA looks up at ProtagonistA's brother , a little exasperated 
  ProtagonistA 'm reading , obviously 
 What does it look like ProtagonistA 'm doing?Well , I do n't know 
 I just thought maybe ProtagonistA were feeling lonely or something 
 I'm not lonely , ProtagonistA 'm reading 
 Now go away and leave ProtagonistA alone 
 I came to see ProtagonistA , obviously 
 What are ProtagonistA doing sitting in here by ProtagonistA reading?I'm not by ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 'm with you now 
 Well , I 'm glad I came then 
 I was starting to worry about ProtagonistA 
 I'm fine , really 
 Okay , well , I 'll let ProtagonistA get back to ProtagonistA's book then 
 I just wanted to make sure ProtagonistA were okay 
 I'm fine , really 
 Thank you for coming to check on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA , it 's time for bed 
 I'm sorry , ProtagonistB 
 It 's okay , ProtagonistA 
 Just one more chapter and then ProtagonistA need to go to bed 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA were up here reading by ProtagonistA

 Just one more chapter and then ProtagonistA need to go to bed 
 However , shortly after their wedding , his hair began to fall out and turn an ugly shade of green 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 The sky was blue with the crying of birds , and the light of the city 
 But something about today felt different 
ProtagonistA was called ' calypso , ' and was carried away in the arms of ProtagonistB ; but perhaps like a god , the same kind of god , as the sun and the moon and the stars and the whole galaxy 
 ProtagonistB was also blue - eyed , brown - haired , and red - eyed , with a florid face 
 But ProtagonistB was not exactly an angel ; ProtagonistB was more like a god 
 The two of them were carried away in each other 's arms , and they were both called ' calypso 
There 's ProtagonistA , and if ProtagonistB follow ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB should catch ProtagonistA , said ProtagonistB , but seemed not to be very careful 
 ProtagonistB was driving too fast and not paying attention to the road 
 As a result , ProtagonistB hit ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's car 
 ProtagonistA was knocked unconscious and taken to the hospital 
 ProtagonistB was arrested and charged with vehicular assault 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA loved the way things were done 
 The people were hesitant at first , but ProtagonistA's passion and determination won them over 
 Soon , they were all working together to make ProtagonistA's vision a reality 
 It was a tough journey , but ProtagonistA never gave up 
 And in the end , ProtagonistA's community was transformed for the better 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought , thinking about the day ProtagonistA had just had 
 It had been a long day , filled with meetings and phone calls and emails 
 It was soft and gentle , and it seemed to be coming from far away 
  It 's time to go to bed 
 ProtagonistA was born in the year of the dragon and was said to be very wise 
 One day , a group of children came to ProtagonistA's house and asked ProtagonistA to tell them a story 
  The children were very interested in this story and asked ProtagonistA to tell them more 
 ProtagonistB was very kind and always helped others 
 One day , ProtagonistB met a man who was also very beautiful 
 They fell in love and got married 
 They had two children , a boy and a girl 
 Unfortunately , ProtagonistB's husband died young 
 ProtagonistB was very sad , but ProtagonistB continued to live in the palace and take care of ProtagonistB's children 
 One day , ProtagonistB met a man who was also very beautiful 
 They fell in love and got married 
 They had two children , a boy and a girl 
 Unfortunately , ProtagonistB's husband died young 
 ProtagonistB was very sad , but ProtagonistB continued to live in the palace and take care of ProtagonistB's children 
ProtagonistA's parents had been struggling to make ends meet ever since ProtagonistA was born 
 They had always been just barely scraping by , but when the recession hit , they were hit hard 
 They lost their jobs , their home , and their car 
 They would load it up with all of their belongings and set off for the day 
 ProtagonistA's parents would beg for money or food while ProtagonistA went to school 
 And each day when ProtagonistA came home , they would be there , waiting for ProtagonistA with a smile 
 Even though they were going through tough times , ProtagonistA's parents never let it get them down 
 They were determined to make it through for ProtagonistA 
 And each day , they did 
ProtagonistA was born in a small village in China 
 ProtagonistA's father was a farmer and ProtagonistB was a stay - at - home wife 
 When ProtagonistA was five , ProtagonistA's father died of a sudden illness and ProtagonistB was left to raise ProtagonistA alone 
 ProtagonistB did the best ProtagonistB could , but ProtagonistB was poor and could not afford to send ProtagonistA to school 
 When ProtagonistA was eight , ProtagonistB died of a heart attack and ProtagonistA was sent to a Chinese orphanage 
 At the orphanage , ProtagonistA was treated well and ProtagonistA soon made friends with the other children 
 When ProtagonistA was sixteen , the orphanage was closed down and ProtagonistA was forced to leave 
 The villagers were kind and welcomed ProtagonistA with open arms 
  Thank you , Your Majesty ,  ProtagonistA said breathlessly 
  You saved ProtagonistA's life 
  The Queen simply smiled and walked away 
In those days , no man had any serious business to do with ProtagonistA , but , for some odd reason , at the age of eighteen ProtagonistA seemed to have gained much more importance than in any other part of ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistB , took the time to listen to ProtagonistA's problems and give ProtagonistA's advice 
 ProtagonistA was accustomed to be the last one to board the little white train at the west end of the Bronx , or at least to begin ProtagonistA's journey without any companion except a stranger who looked and spoke like ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was also boarding the train 
 As it turned out , ProtagonistB was also the daughter of a market girl and an explorer 
 ProtagonistB's name was Lily 
 The two girls talked all the way to the end of the line , and when they parted ways , they promised to keep in touch 
 They wrote to each other often , sharing stories of their lives 
 They both dreamed of the day when they would explore the world together 
 One day , their dreams came true 
 ProtagonistB came to visit ProtagonistA in Brooklyn and the two of them set off on the adventure of a lifetime 
 They saw all the sights that the world had to offer and their bond only grew stronger 
 They say that true friendship is rare 
 They remain friends to this day , exploring the world and their own lives , always learning new things about each other and themselves 
 But that did n't bother ProtagonistA 
 And ProtagonistA knew that one day , people would see ProtagonistA for who ProtagonistA really was and they would love ProtagonistA for it 
 ProtagonistA's boss had been understanding and had even given ProtagonistA a raise 
Once upon a time there lived ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's life was perfect 
 One day , ProtagonistA's perfect life came to an end 
 ProtagonistA's boyfriend broke up with ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's family moved away , and ProtagonistA lost ProtagonistA's job 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistB was charming and handsome , and ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA feel special 
 However , unbeknownst to ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB was actually a vampire 
 ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA for some time , and ProtagonistB had been waiting for the perfect moment to strike 
 When ProtagonistA was alone with ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB finally revealed ProtagonistB's true nature 
 ProtagonistB attacked ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was helpless to resist 
From the time of its beginnings , the story of the Tudor house has been told in many different ways 
 Some say that the house was built on the site of an ancient Roman villa 
 Others say that it was built by a wealthy merchant in the 14th century 
 Whatever its origins , the Tudor house has been a part of English history for centuries 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's heir , the Princess Mrs
 Victoria , were the last occupants of the house 
 After their deaths , the house was sold to a private buyer 
 It has changed hands many times since then , but it remains a beautiful and historic landmark 
ProtagonistA was raised in a secluded compound by ProtagonistC and a group of other men 
 ProtagonistA was never allowed to leave and never saw any other women 
 ProtagonistB was the first man ProtagonistA had ever seen and ProtagonistA was instantly fascinated by ProtagonistB 
 They began to meet secretly and ProtagonistA soon fell in love with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC found out and was furious 
 ProtagonistC forbade ProtagonistA from seeing ProtagonistB again and locked ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's room 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 It was n't the most comfortable thing , but it would have to do until ProtagonistA could get new boots 
ProtagonistA was a little over a mile away , head down , arms rolled in ProtagonistA's lap 
 It was a long walk , but ProtagonistA did n't mind 
 The same dreamy look is in ProtagonistA's eyes , and ProtagonistA still loves to sit by the window and watch the world go by 
 I am glad that ProtagonistA has kept ProtagonistA's childlike wonder , and I hope that ProtagonistA never loses it 
  Nothing good ever happens without a cause ,  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's voice dripping with sarcasm 
  You killed that cat , did n't you ?  The kids all denied it , but ProtagonistA did n't believe them 
ProtagonistA's life changed the day ProtagonistB died 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 But then something strange happened 
 ProtagonistB , was always the more level - headed one , and ProtagonistB always tried to keep ProtagonistA in check 
 It was a hard road , but with ProtagonistB's help , ProtagonistA eventually found true happiness from within 
 Hi , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA walking home and ProtagonistB just wanted to make sure ProtagonistA 're okay 
 ProtagonistB listened and then gave ProtagonistA some advice 
 I'm sure ProtagonistC did n't mean to hurt ProtagonistA's feelings ,  ProtagonistB said 
 Now everything was back to normal between them 
The little housemaids had delighted in guessing where ProtagonistA might be , using the antique raven as their guide 
 Now , the raven was perched atop the masthead of the silver boat that carried ProtagonistA to the small town of Bucklemore 
 It was as if the bird was guiding ProtagonistA on ProtagonistA's journey 
In the year 1358 , during the reign of King Edward the First , was born ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was a good man , but ProtagonistB was also a very proud one 
 ProtagonistB did not like it when ProtagonistA spoke ProtagonistA's mind , and ProtagonistB often told ProtagonistA to be quiet 
 This made ProtagonistA very angry , and ProtagonistA would often argue with ProtagonistB 
 One day , ProtagonistB was away on business , and ProtagonistA was left at home with ProtagonistA's two children 
 ProtagonistB was not happy when ProtagonistB found out that ProtagonistA had been talking to peasants 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was not to associate with them anymore , and ProtagonistB forbade ProtagonistA from going near them 
 This made ProtagonistA very angry , and ProtagonistA decided to defy ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was furious when ProtagonistB found out what ProtagonistA was doing 
 ProtagonistB demanded that ProtagonistA stop , but ProtagonistA refused 
 ProtagonistB then threatened to divorce ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA still refused 
 Finally , ProtagonistB made good on ProtagonistB's threat , and ProtagonistB divorced ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's story is an inspirational one , and it shows that it is never too late to learn 
 It 's a pity to see ProtagonistA's head , ProtagonistA's wife , all throbbing and squirmy , ProtagonistA's eyes so half - closed ,  said ProtagonistB in ProtagonistB's sweetest voice 
  ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA not to drink so much wine , but ProtagonistA would n't listen to ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistA's head was indeed throbbing and squirmy , and ProtagonistA's eyes were only half - open 
  ProtagonistA 'm so sorry , ProtagonistA's love ,  ProtagonistA said finally 
  Please forgive ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head and walked away , leaving ProtagonistA alone with ProtagonistA's throbbing head and squirming stomach 
 It had been two years since ProtagonistB's death , and ProtagonistA felt it was time to tell their story 
In truth , for all the things ProtagonistA had , no one expected ProtagonistA to be a mother 
 But when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , everything changed 
 ProtagonistA 's always been there for me , even when I was a little girl 
 I remember when I was five , I wanted to go to the park by myself 
 I know ProtagonistA 's always been there for me , even when I did n't realize it 
 Now , I ca n't imagine my life without ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA's family had always been a bit suspicious of ProtagonistA 
 So when ProtagonistA came to them one day and said ProtagonistA was someone else entirely , they did n't believe ProtagonistA 
 They thought ProtagonistA was just acting out , trying to get attention 
 Slowly , but surely , ProtagonistA's family began to believe ProtagonistA 
 And they were happy for ProtagonistA , that ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's true self 
ProtagonistA , partook of the Professor 's tea , an infusion of which was prepared for ProtagonistA by the hand of the cook of the kitchen 
 It was a most delicious tea , and ProtagonistA was soon lost in thought , wondering what sort of adventures ProtagonistA might have if ProtagonistA drank more of it 
 The sea was crashing against the shore , and the bodies of ProtagonistA's fellow soldiers were floating in the water 
It was Sunday morning when ProtagonistA came into the living room of ProtagonistA's house in the Avenue of the Thames 
 Paul 's Cathedral 
 The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was going to bed , and then ProtagonistA woke up here 
 It was just endless water 
 It was getting brighter and brighter , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA being pulled towards it 
 ProtagonistA's heart sank when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA's house was on fire 
 It should be fine , Dr
 Sandor 
The air in the room in which ProtagonistA , before every other girl in ProtagonistA's family , had been married , was of a clear , clear water , free from the mists of the night 
 It was a room that had been in ProtagonistA's family for generations , and it was said that the air in that room had the power to bring good luck to those who were married in it 
 This was ProtagonistA's home , and this was where ProtagonistA belonged 
 They ended up becoming good friends and would often talk and hang out together 
 It turns out , ProtagonistB felt the same way about ProtagonistA and they ended up dating 
 They 've been together for five years now and are very happy 
 To ProtagonistA , they were all the same 
 I'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but there is no one here 
 The parish has been closed down 
 ProtagonistA was confused 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could come and live with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistB was huge ! ProtagonistB's muscles rippled under ProtagonistB's skin , and ProtagonistB's eyes burned with a fierce intensity 
 ProtagonistB was like a lion who had been tamed , and ProtagonistA felt safe in ProtagonistB's presence 
 They stared at each other for a long moment , and then ProtagonistB spoke 
 ProtagonistB have been waiting for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistA would come 
 ProtagonistB voice was like thunder , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's knees tremble 
 ProtagonistB am the Guardian of this place 
 It is ProtagonistB's duty to protect those who enter 
 And why do ProtagonistB need to protect me?Because ProtagonistA are special , ProtagonistA 
 Come , sit down and rest 
 ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA to a nearby tree and ProtagonistA sat down 
 ProtagonistB sat down next to ProtagonistA and they looked at each other for a long time 
 Thank ProtagonistB for protecting ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was respected by many in the wizarding world and ProtagonistA's courtship was highly sought after 
 However , ProtagonistA's son 's death ended ProtagonistA's courtship and left ProtagonistA heartbroken 
 The walls were all curved , and the floor was uneven 
 ProtagonistA's face grew larger as ProtagonistA walked , and ProtagonistA's shoulders were more than a foot above the floor 
 Furniture that was too big for ProtagonistA , food that was too big for ProtagonistA , and even a cat that was as big as ProtagonistA was 
 And so it was 
 ProtagonistB was found dead in ProtagonistB's bed , with ProtagonistB's eyes wide open and a look of terror on ProtagonistB's face 
 It is said that ProtagonistA knew what would happen , and ProtagonistA tried to warn ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB would not listen 
 They told ProtagonistA they were homeless and had nowhere to go 
 They told ProtagonistA that the government did n't care about them 
 ProtagonistA was told that the government was aware of the problem and was working on a solution 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 The boys were very angry and started to chase ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had just been raped 
It was about that day that ProtagonistA finally said goodbye to ProtagonistB and child 
 ProtagonistA had packed ProtagonistA's bags and made all the arrangements , and now all ProtagonistA had to do was say the words 
 ProtagonistA 'm taking the child with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was stunned 
 ProtagonistB could n't believe that ProtagonistA was really doing this 
 ProtagonistB begged ProtagonistA to stay , but ProtagonistA was resolute 
 It was a difficult decision , but ProtagonistA knew it was the right thing to do 
The first time I saw ProtagonistA ProtagonistA was in a corridor of the saloon of the house on Heffernan Street , in the midst of Barnes ' Market 
 I was struck by ProtagonistA's beauty , but it was ProtagonistA's eyes that really caught my attention 
 They were a deep blue , almost violet , and they seemed to look right into my soul 
 I could tell that ProtagonistA was a kind and caring person , and I knew that I wanted to get to know ProtagonistA better 
 I introduced myself , and we began talking 
 I soon found out that ProtagonistA was a widow , and that ProtagonistA was looking for a new place to live 
 I offered to help ProtagonistA find a place , and ProtagonistA accepted 
 We spent the next few days looking at different properties , but none of them seemed quite right 
 Finally , I suggested that ProtagonistA move in with me , and ProtagonistA agreed 
 We've been living together for six months now , and I ca n't imagine my life without ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with big , blue eyes and ProtagonistA felt a sudden surge of maternal instinct 
 They named ProtagonistB Stripes and ProtagonistB quickly became a part of the family 
 ProtagonistB looked so much like ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA's husband often joked that ProtagonistB was really ProtagonistA's son 
 As ProtagonistB grew , ProtagonistB began to look more and more like a man 
 By the time ProtagonistB was five inches tall , ProtagonistB looked exactly like ProtagonistA's husband 
 This caused some tension in the family , but they all loved ProtagonistB and accepted ProtagonistB as one of their own 
 One day , when ProtagonistB was five inches long , ProtagonistB ran away from home 
 They always wondered what happened to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 's been in every picture book , every movie , and every TV show 
 We all know ProtagonistA's story by heart 
 But how did ProtagonistA come to be?No one knows for sure , but the most popular theory is that ProtagonistA was created by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was a mathematician and a writer , and ProtagonistB was fascinated by children 
 ProtagonistB would often take them on boat rides and tell them stories 
 One day , ProtagonistB told a story about ProtagonistA 
 The children loved it so much that they begged ProtagonistB to write it down 
 And so ProtagonistB did 
 The picture of ProtagonistA that we all know and love was drawn by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB wanted to make sure that ProtagonistA looked exactly like the children ProtagonistB had told the story to 
 It was better for ProtagonistB to die now , before it was too late 
ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's early twenty - first year , had , in fact , the least to do , of all ProtagonistB's ladies of ProtagonistA's age , in the establishment of a palace for them at the point where the river Styx flows into the Thrym - yard 
 The other ladies , all older and more experienced , took charge of the construction , while ProtagonistA was given the task of supervising the servants and making sure the palace ran smoothly 
 It was struggling against the current , and ProtagonistA could see that it was exhausted 
 The fish was so grateful to ProtagonistA for saving its life , and it soon became clear that it had magical powers 
 It granted ProtagonistA three wishes , and ProtagonistA used them wisely 
 The fish 's magical powers had transformed the palace into a beautiful and luxurious home , and ProtagonistA was proud to have played a part in it 
In the museum of ancient things , high above the city , the great city of Diagona , ProtagonistA lies , ProtagonistA's body neatly folded in ProtagonistA's lap 
 The secret is that the museum is actually a portal to another world 
 This world was dark and full of monsters 
 They caught ProtagonistA and dragged ProtagonistA into the darkness 
ProtagonistA was born and ProtagonistA was a boy , but ProtagonistA looked as if ProtagonistA had been shot 
 The doctors said that there was nothing wrong with ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA knew that something was wrong 
 The woman said that ProtagonistA had the power to change ProtagonistA's form into any creature that ProtagonistA wanted 
 ProtagonistA's friends rushed to ProtagonistA's side , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistA was gone 
 The sky was dark and the stars were shining 
 They were saying that it was time for ProtagonistA to go home 
 One day , while out walking along the shore , ProtagonistA came across a dead body 
 The body was that of ProtagonistB 
 There was a note next to the body that said  ProtagonistB 'm sorry  
 They had their ups and downs , but overall , their relationship was strong 
 They started a family and had two beautiful children 
 Unfortunately , when the economy took a turn for the worse , they were forced to make some tough decisions 
 They both lost their jobs and their home was foreclosed on 
 They were forced to move in with ProtagonistA's parents 
 It was a difficult time for the family , but they managed to get by 
 Things finally started to turn around for them when they both found new jobs 
 They were able to save enough money to buy a new home and they were finally able to start fresh 
 So when ProtagonistA was accepted into a prestigious boarding school , they were over the moon 
 ProtagonistA was gifted with a special ability - ProtagonistA could see into the future 
 It was a tragic accident that could have been avoided 
 ProtagonistA was rushed to the hospital , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistA was gone 
 It was a beautiful day , and they were enjoying the view of the skyline 
 ProtagonistB commented on how lucky ProtagonistA was to live in such a beautiful city 
 ProtagonistB sympathized , but said that ProtagonistB thought the city was exciting and full of opportunity 
 ProtagonistB had never known what to do with that face , how to protect ProtagonistA from the dangers that it seemed to attract 
 And so ProtagonistB had always been on ProtagonistB's guard , never letting ProtagonistA out of ProtagonistB's sight for a moment , and never letting ProtagonistA out of the house after dark 
 But now , ProtagonistA was grown up , and ProtagonistB was no longer with ProtagonistA 
 The darkness did n't consume ProtagonistA , and the monsters did n't come to get ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistB had not expected to find ProtagonistA dead 
 ProtagonistB had been walking in the woods , looking for mushrooms , when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA's body lying on the ground 
 ProtagonistA was lying on ProtagonistA's back , ProtagonistA's eyes open and staring up at the sky 
 There was no blood , no signs of violence 
 It looked as if ProtagonistA had simply lain down and died 
 ProtagonistB called the police and then sat down to wait 
 ProtagonistB was in shock , and it was n't until the police arrived that ProtagonistB realized ProtagonistB had been crying 
The first thing the sun saw when it rose on the first Sunday in June was that glinting spear of ProtagonistA in the distance 
 ProtagonistA was called Der Runde , and ProtagonistA was the most beautiful thing the sun had ever seen 
 The sun rose higher in the sky , and the light caught ProtagonistA's face 
 The sun rose higher still , and the light caught ProtagonistA's hair 
 It was the color of gold , and it shone like a crown 
 The sun rose higher and higher , until it was directly overhead 
 And then , suddenly , ProtagonistA was gone 
 ProtagonistA's family was very proud of ProtagonistA , and they knew that ProtagonistA would always be there to protect them 
 ProtagonistA's eyes were small and sharp , and ProtagonistA's mouth was large and coarse 
 ProtagonistA's hair was white , and ProtagonistA wore it in a long , tangled mass 
 ProtagonistA was always clothed in black , and ProtagonistA had a way of looking at you that was very unpleasant 
The ghost of ProtagonistA towered over the room 
 ProtagonistB was everything ProtagonistA had ever wanted in a man , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be faithful to ProtagonistA 
 They got married and moved to a small town in the middle of nowhere 
 It was perfect 
 They had a beautiful house and a wonderful life 
 Everything was perfect , until ProtagonistB started cheating on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 They lived in a small town and everyone knew them 
 One day , ProtagonistA's daughter went to the store and did n't come back 
The night ProtagonistA vanished was the night when ProtagonistA shared ProtagonistA's bed with ProtagonistB 
 It was also the night when ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistB was a vampire 
 When ProtagonistA confronted ProtagonistB about it , ProtagonistB did n't deny it 
 In fact , ProtagonistB seemed almost proud of it 
 That 's when ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get away from ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 's never looked back since 
 It was a cold day and ProtagonistA was bundled up in ProtagonistA's coat , scarf , and gloves 
 ProtagonistB , was trying to build a snowman but was having trouble 
 That was the last time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 Even when ProtagonistB was no longer a little girl ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB would still come to visit ProtagonistA and help ProtagonistA build the snowman 
 And every year , they would give each other a big hug 
 I was very happy for ProtagonistB and I knew that ProtagonistB would be able to get a good education at the college 
 ProtagonistA's headache had been getting worse and worse , to the point where ProtagonistA could barely function 
 It was n't perfect , but it was the best ProtagonistA could do 
 It was a small shadow , about the size of a mouse , and it had a curious look on its face 
 The shadow seemed to be looking around the kitchen , as if it were looking for something 
 After a few minutes , it got up from the table and started to explore the rest of the room 
 It sounded like something was knocking over furniture 
 The shadow turned to look at ProtagonistA and then ran out the door 
 ProtagonistA lost sight of it and it was gone 
 ProtagonistA was bewildered by what had just happened 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm home !  ProtagonistB called out 
 Maybe it was just a strange coincidence and ProtagonistA would never see it again 
On Tuesday , Mr
 Bligh came to me at home with the news that ProtagonistA had been admitted into the College of the Holy - McPherson Priory , and that it would be five years before ProtagonistA would be able to see ProtagonistA's aunt 
 I was so happy for ProtagonistA , but I knew that it would be hard for ProtagonistA to be away from ProtagonistA's family for so long 
 Bligh said that the College would take good care of ProtagonistA and that ProtagonistA would have everything ProtagonistA needed 
 I thanked Mr
 Bligh for his help in getting ProtagonistA into the College and for his kind words 
ProtagonistA's husband had died eight days ago , and ProtagonistA was still in mourning 
 Belvedere of the Parisian street fly - and - supplies , Dr
 John Quartermaster - of - the - ship - whale Squadron Heterozone of the Navy , and indeed the world - famous spectacles - in - the - air 
 ProtagonistC shouted at ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC am coming to murder ProtagonistA ! Go away , ProtagonistA was terrified 
 When they arrived , they found ProtagonistC still outside , ranting and raving 
 They took ProtagonistC away and ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief 
 ProtagonistA's hair was silver and ProtagonistA's skin was as smooth as porcelain 
 I felt like I was in the presence of royalty 
 I will never forget that day , and I will always cherish the memories I have of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as Harry and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would be ProtagonistA's friend 
 From that day forward , ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA laugh when ProtagonistA was feeling down and helped ProtagonistA adjust to ProtagonistA's new life 
It was a cold , wind - shrouded morning when ProtagonistA tucked me into bed , one full of the dread of the future , and ProtagonistA's own worries , and put ProtagonistA's trust and faith in me 
ProtagonistA was getting fed up with ProtagonistB constantly calling ProtagonistA  Madam 
 ' It makes ProtagonistA feel like an old lady 
 ProtagonistA aunt was taken aback at first , but then ProtagonistB realized how ProtagonistA must feel 
 Of course , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB 'm sorry if ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA feel uncomfortable 
 ProtagonistB 'll try to remember to call ProtagonistA by ProtagonistA's name from now on 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was a writer and that ProtagonistB was working on ProtagonistB's latest novel 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA was a writer too , and ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that if ProtagonistA wanted to be a writer , ProtagonistA should just start writing 
 It was that simple 
 ProtagonistB wanted to know more about ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB was determined to find out 
 ProtagonistB would do whatever it took to get to know ProtagonistA better 
It was a warm day in early June when ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB said their vows 
 They were surrounded by their closest family and friends , all of whom were beaming with happiness 
 It was a perfect day 
 The cause of death was a complication of pregnancy - something that no one could have predicted or prevented 
 ProtagonistA had only been married for a short time , but in that time ProtagonistA had been incredibly happy 
 ProtagonistA's death came as a shock to everyone who knew ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was devastated 
 ProtagonistB could n't believe that ProtagonistA was gone , and that ProtagonistB would never see ProtagonistA again 
 The pain was unbearable 
 ProtagonistA's family and friends were also grieving 
 They could n't believe that ProtagonistA was gone so soon 
 It was a tragic event , but everyone who loved ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never be forgotten 
ProtagonistA was born in a house where the gods took their name from ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistC from the earth 
 It was a happy home , full of laughter and love 
 But when ProtagonistA's father died , everything changed 
 ProtagonistB became a bitter woman , and ProtagonistB began to take ProtagonistB's anger out on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB would beat ProtagonistA and call ProtagonistA's names , making ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistA was nothing 
 So ProtagonistA held onto ProtagonistA's memories of ProtagonistA's happy childhood , and ProtagonistA used them to keep ProtagonistA going 
 ProtagonistA was relieved to have made it this far , but ProtagonistA's journey was far from over 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistB yell after ProtagonistA 
 It was a big city and ProtagonistA was ready for a new adventure 
 It did n't take long for ProtagonistA to settle into ProtagonistA's new life 
 ProtagonistA's first year of college was a great success 
 It was definitely the right decision for ProtagonistA 
 It was n't something ProtagonistA wanted to do , but ProtagonistA knew it had to be done 
 It would be quick and painless , and over before they knew what was happening 
 The only thing left was to choose ProtagonistA's victim 
 Once ProtagonistA had made ProtagonistA's decision , there was no turning back 
 The day of the murder arrived , and ProtagonistA's heart was pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
 The victim was alone , just as ProtagonistA had planned 
 It was over before the victim even knew what was happening 
 ProtagonistA's only companions were the books ProtagonistA read and the animals ProtagonistA cared for 
 One day , however , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA's door , begging for help 
 They were married a year later , and lived happily ever after 
 ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA and waved back , looking exhausted but happy 
 ProtagonistB brought the horses to a stop and jumped down , giving ProtagonistA a big hug 
  ProtagonistB 'm so glad to see ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 've been thinking about ProtagonistA all day 
 But ProtagonistB loved them 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was cleaning the cages , one of the rooks escaped 
 ProtagonistB was not happy when ProtagonistA found out about the escaped bird 
 But ProtagonistB said ,  It is what it is 
 And it 's what ProtagonistA get for not taking care of them properly 
 It was a strange turn of events , but in the end , ProtagonistA learned to love the birds as much as ProtagonistB did 
 It was an accident , of course 
 Just a girl with a few tricks up ProtagonistA's sleeve 
 Suddenly , the rabbit turned and saw ProtagonistA 
 It seemed just as surprised to see ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA was to see it 
 For a moment , they just stared at each other 
 Then , the rabbit spoke 
 I'm late , I 'm late , for a very important date !  it said 
 And with that , it turned and dashed away 
 It was hard to believe that just a few months ago , the skies had been a bright , beautiful blue 
 Now , they were a dull , lifeless silver 
 The sun was still shining , but even its rays could n't penetrate the thick layer of smog that now blanketed the city 
 The only green left was in ProtagonistA's little garden , and even that was struggling to survive 
 It was a beautiful world , and ProtagonistA longed to be there 
It was a great , wonderful day in the year 1780 , when ProtagonistA gave birth to ProtagonistA's second child 
 Everything went smoothly and the baby was healthy and perfect 
ProtagonistA was born to a wealthy family in the city of Paris on the morning of the 19th of February , 1612 
 ProtagonistA's parents named ProtagonistA's Alice after ProtagonistA's maternal grandmother 
 They were very much in love and had a beautiful wedding 
 They were very happy there and had two wonderful children together 
 Sadly , ProtagonistA's idyllic life was cut short when ProtagonistA contracted a deadly illness and passed away at the age of thirty - two 
 ProtagonistB and children were devastated by ProtagonistA's untimely death 
 ProtagonistA will be forever missed by those who loved ProtagonistA 
It was early morning on the fifth of July , and ProtagonistC was out walking along the banks of the Thames with several other people 
 They were in the vicinity of a house called the Mulhouse , which belonged to ProtagonistA 
 As they walked , they talked and laughed together , enjoying the beautiful morning 
 The sun was just starting to peek over the horizon , and the birds were singing in the trees 
 It was a peaceful and happy time 
 Suddenly , they heard a loud noise coming from the Mulhouse 
 It sounded like someone was crying or screaming inside 
 They all stopped and looked at each other , wondering what to do 
 ProtagonistC decided to investigate 
 ProtagonistC walked up to the house and knocked on the door 
 When no one answered , ProtagonistC cautiously opened it and peeked inside 
 What ProtagonistC saw was ProtagonistB , lying on the floor in a pool of blood 
 It was clear that ProtagonistB had been brutally murdered 
 ProtagonistC immediately ran back to the others and told them what ProtagonistC had seen 
 They all agreed that they should go to the authorities and report what they had found 
 The police arrived soon after and began to investigate the scene 
 It was a tragic event , but thanks to the quick thinking of ProtagonistC , justice was eventually served 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a white dress and ProtagonistA's hair was in a perfect bun 
 ProtagonistA hated who ProtagonistA was 
 It was a slow process , but ProtagonistA was getting there , and that kitchen felt like a symbol of ProtagonistA's progress 
 It was a bittersweet moment for ProtagonistA 
 They had been packing all day and were both exhausted 
 ProtagonistB's trunk was especially heavy 
To Carol is very nearly a treasure , and though it is not proper to discuss the disposition of ProtagonistA before ProtagonistA has attained to a certain age , I shall say that the owner of the house opposite to which I am now sitting , and of a certain age there never was a person who , till ProtagonistA had reached ProtagonistA's twenty - first birthday , could not plainly distinguish ProtagonistA – those persons were all strangers to ProtagonistA 
 The sun was streaming in through the windows and the air was thick and heavy 
 Suddenly , the door to the dining - room opened and in walked ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was carrying a large tray of food , which ProtagonistB placed in the middle of the table 
 ProtagonistB then went over to the windows and began to open them , letting in a much - needed breeze 
 There , that 's better ,  ProtagonistB said 
  It was getting a bit stuffy in here 
I am a man of thirty - nine years , and a thousand and one years ago at the beginning of the twelfth century ProtagonistA , appeared in the court of ProtagonistB , and ordered the execution of four hundred and fifty - two religious and political persons 
 ProtagonistA's skin was pale and flawless 
 ProtagonistA was brought before ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB demanded to know who ProtagonistA was and what ProtagonistA was doing there 
 ProtagonistB was not a man who tolerated dissent or threats 
 ProtagonistB ordered ProtagonistA to be executed immediately 
 ProtagonistA was brought to the executioner 's block and ProtagonistA's head was severed from ProtagonistA's body 
 They had come to conquer ProtagonistA's village , and ProtagonistA knew that they would kill ProtagonistA if they found ProtagonistA 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was running towards ProtagonistA , calling out to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB scooped ProtagonistA up in ProtagonistB's arms and ran back towards the village 
 The Lōkampans were close behind them , but they managed to make it to safety 
 And they were both good women , and they were both honest , and they were both wise 
 And they loved each other dearly 
 And they had ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB's name was Cain 
 And ProtagonistB was a good man , and ProtagonistB was honest , and ProtagonistB was wise 
  Well , ProtagonistA , it 's a bit complicated ,  ProtagonistB replied 
  But ProtagonistB 'll try to explain it to ProtagonistA 
   The world is round , and it spins on its axis ,  ProtagonistB began 
  The sun is what gives us day and night , and the moon is what causes the tides 
  Yes , it is ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But there 's still more to learn 
ProtagonistB had always said that the best way to get information out of ProtagonistA in the future was not to kill ProtagonistA , but to expose ProtagonistA , to the light of ridicule 
 So , when the time came , ProtagonistB did just that 
 ProtagonistB called a press conference and announced that ProtagonistA , had been having an affair with one of ProtagonistA's students 
 The media had a field day with the story , and ProtagonistA was soon laughed out of ProtagonistA's job 
 ProtagonistB felt that ProtagonistB had finally gotten the information ProtagonistB needed out of ProtagonistA 
In the summer of that year , 1577 , ProtagonistA , wrote a letter to the Golden Bough , in the neighbourhood of Jermyn , in Yorkshire , where ProtagonistA then was living , in which ProtagonistA says:I have been thinking much about you of late , dear Bough , and wondering how you are getting on 
 ProtagonistB is a very remarkable woman , and ProtagonistA am sure you will be as impressed as ProtagonistA was by ProtagonistB's intelligence and ProtagonistB's energy 
 ProtagonistA 
Frank Wilson , an old friend and colleague of ProtagonistA's , once said ,  ProtagonistB am afraid , ProtagonistA , that when ProtagonistC is doing a little bit of necessary thing , you know all about it , and ProtagonistA 's got all sorts of things on ProtagonistA's conscience , but when ProtagonistA is doing all sorts of unnecessary thing , you never know what 's going on , you just know you 're used to it , and it 's when you 're doing a great deal of unnecessary thing that you really get into trouble 
 ProtagonistB could n't help but admire ProtagonistA for it , even if ProtagonistB did n't always understand ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistC was in trouble and needed help , but ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
  ProtagonistC is in trouble and ProtagonistA do n't know how to help ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB thought for a moment and then said ,  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 're a smart woman 
 ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA 'll figure it out 
Siskais will not have noticed that the very day when ProtagonistA was to enrol in ProtagonistA's first year of school , ProtagonistB had ProtagonistA sent to the London School of Economics 
 It was only when ProtagonistB received a letter from the school informing ProtagonistB of ProtagonistA's enrolment that ProtagonistB realised what had happened 
 Although ProtagonistB was disappointed that ProtagonistB would not be able to see ProtagonistA starting school , ProtagonistB was happy that ProtagonistA would be getting a good education 
 ProtagonistB was sure that ProtagonistA would make the most of ProtagonistA's opportunities and make something of ProtagonistA 
 alive 
 There were people everywhere , and the noise was overwhelming 
 Who knows , maybe one day ProtagonistA would be the one teaching others about the magic ProtagonistA was just beginning to learn ProtagonistA 
There 's something about that great House of Potter , the House of Black and White , that makes ProtagonistA just as well off as ProtagonistA is 
 ProtagonistA 's never been happier than ProtagonistA is now , and ProtagonistA knows that it 's all because of the House of Potter 
 The mob was so shocked that they stopped chasing ProtagonistA 
 They all stood there in silence , not knowing what to do 
 After a few minutes , they dispersed and went back to their homes 
 ProtagonistA's body was never found 
 ProtagonistB was different because ProtagonistB had died several times and had killed children 
 As time went on , ProtagonistB started to change 
 ProtagonistB became more and more violent 
 ProtagonistB would kill animals and then children 
 One day , ProtagonistB went too far 
 ProtagonistB killed a lot of people in ProtagonistA's town 
 It was the only way to save the world from ProtagonistB's violence 
 This person told ProtagonistA that the transfiguration was a state of perfect felicity and that ProtagonistA would be able to conduct ProtagonistA's life in an extraordinary way if ProtagonistA attained it 
 Finally , the day arrived 
 Now that ProtagonistA has attained the transfiguration , ProtagonistA's life is changed 
ProtagonistA was born in Oxford , England 
 ProtagonistA was instructed in the healing arts at the Royal College of the Healing Arts in Oxford 
 But then ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA some of the things ProtagonistB could do and ProtagonistA was convinced 
 It was one of ProtagonistA's favorite times of day 
 ProtagonistB loved to watch ProtagonistA in action 
 One day , ProtagonistB decided to take a turn at hosting tea time 
 ProtagonistB sent for the servants and lay down on the front steps of the Black family house 
 ProtagonistB was determined to show ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB could be just as graceful and elegant as ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA was impressed with ProtagonistB's performance 
 ProtagonistB had successfully managed to host tea time just like ProtagonistA 
 From then on , tea time was always a special time for the two of them to share 
One day , when ProtagonistB was 13 and ProtagonistA was only five , their mother took them to see the ancient statue of the Roman emperor Antonius 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated by the statue and asked ProtagonistA's mother a lot of questions about it 
 ProtagonistB , on the other hand , was not interested in the statue at all 
 ProtagonistB thought it was boring and wished they had gone to see something else 
 I did n't recognize ProtagonistA at first , but then I remembered the time we spent together in high school 
 We were in the same grade , but we never really talked to each other 
 But then , one day , we were paired together in a project , and we started talking 
 And we just clicked 
 We were friends from then on 
 ProtagonistA started to wear dark clothes and ProtagonistA grew ProtagonistA's hair out 
 I did n't know how to react , and I guess I just ignored ProtagonistA 
 I did n't see ProtagonistA again after that 
 until now 
 When ProtagonistA gets the bright idea to go into the library by ProtagonistA , no one ever takes ProtagonistA up on it 
 ProtagonistA 's always been a bit of a loner , so it does n't bother ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 's never had so much fun 
 The streets were dirty and dangerous 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was out walking , ProtagonistA was accosted by a group of ruffians 
 They demanded ProtagonistA's money and ProtagonistA's jewels 
 Suddenly , one of the men pulled out a knife and stabbed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been married for fifteen years , and ProtagonistA had two children 
 ProtagonistB was a stay - at - home dad , and ProtagonistA's children were both in school 
 ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistB would make dinner for once ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB know ProtagonistA 're tired after work 
 ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistB's gesture , and they enjoyed a nice dinner together 
 Afterward , they went into the living room and sat down to watch TV 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB have something to tell ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 I'm leaving ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm in love with someone else , and ProtagonistB 'm moving out 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistB packed ProtagonistB's bags and left , and ProtagonistA was left alone with ProtagonistA's two children 
 It was hard , but ProtagonistA got through it 
The air grew still as ProtagonistA entered the main door of the old office , but ProtagonistA was ready 
 ProtagonistB hesitated for a moment before pointing ProtagonistA in the right direction 
 ProtagonistC was sitting behind a large desk , and ProtagonistC did not look happy 
  ProtagonistC leaned back in ProtagonistC's chair and looked at ProtagonistA for a long moment 
 Finally , ProtagonistC spoke 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC 'm sorry , but we 've decided to go with someone else for the position 
 ProtagonistC hesitated for a moment before answering 
  It 's just not a good fit ,  ProtagonistC said 
  ProtagonistC 'm sorry 
ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's bony hands and feet enough to accommodate ProtagonistA to a load of cushions ; they made a little coffin for ProtagonistA , so heavy it contained four bales of straw 
 The only thing ProtagonistA could do was to watch as the people around ProtagonistA wept and mourned ProtagonistA's death 
 The day finally arrived and ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way to the castle 
 ProtagonistA was met by the headmaster , who welcomed ProtagonistA warmly 
 ProtagonistA was shown to ProtagonistA's dormitory and given a wand 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled and could n't wait to start ProtagonistA's classes 
 Unfortunately , things did n't quite go as ProtagonistA 'd hoped 
 ProtagonistA struggled through ProtagonistA's classes , feeling like ProtagonistA was always behind 
 ProtagonistA's roommates were all much better than ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA did n't belong 
 ProtagonistA was n't used to the rough country life or the heat of the winter , but ProtagonistA was determined to be a farmer 
 The villagers were outraged , and ProtagonistA was arrested and thrown into jail 
 ProtagonistA was paid very little , and was always given the most difficult and dangerous tasks to do 
 ProtagonistA was constantly being put in harm 's way , and ProtagonistA was tired of it 
 They were so bright , so big , and they seemed to be watching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB's smile faded and ProtagonistB said they were just talking 
 ProtagonistA's mother looked at ProtagonistA suspiciously and said ProtagonistA should go to ProtagonistA's room 
 ProtagonistA's curiosity was unquenchable , and ProtagonistA was always learning new things 
 All of these abilities make ProtagonistA an extraordinary individual , and it is no wonder that ProtagonistA is considered one of the most intelligent people in the world 
As the story of the life of ProtagonistA begins , we should recall that ProtagonistB , is dead 
 It is interesting to think about how different our lives would be if ProtagonistB had not written about ProtagonistA 
 Perhaps we would never have known ProtagonistA at all 
 In any case , it is clear that ProtagonistB had a great influence on the life of ProtagonistA 
I asked ProtagonistA for a free copy of the dictionary , and ProtagonistA gave me the manual 
 I was so excited to get my hands on a free copy of the dictionary that I did n't even mind that it was the manual 
 I thanked ProtagonistA profusely and went on my way 
 I spent the next few days pouring over the manual , and I was amazed at how much information was in there 
 I learned about the history of the dictionary , how it was compiled , and all sorts of interesting facts about words 
 I was particularly fascinated by the etymology of words , and I spent hours tracing the origins of my favorite words 
 Eventually , I had to return the manual to ProtagonistA , but I was grateful for the opportunity to have borrowed it 
 I now have a much greater appreciation for the dictionary , and I 'm even considering buying my own copy 
 It was hard to tell , with ProtagonistA's ever - changing form 
 ProtagonistA's eyes were always the same though , piercing and blue 
 They seemed to look right through you , as if ProtagonistA could see your very soul 
 People were drawn to ProtagonistA , even though they could n't quite understand ProtagonistA 
 It was as if ProtagonistA knew something that the rest of us didn't 
 They seemed to haunt those who knew ProtagonistA , as if they were asking a question that nobody could answer 
 What happened to ProtagonistA ? Was ProtagonistA a witch ? A goddess ? A demon ? Or was ProtagonistA something else entirely ? We may never know , but ProtagonistA will always be remembered 
There is a place on a very small and very remote island in the Pacific where one can go into the deepest secrets of nature and find ProtagonistA 
 It is said that ProtagonistA is a spirit who lives in the heart of the island and that ProtagonistA knows all the secrets of the natural world 
 ProtagonistA was constantly getting scolded by ProtagonistA's superior officers , and ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was never good enough 
 One day , ProtagonistA was assigned to cook for the entire battalion 
 The other soldiers were so angry with ProtagonistA that they started throwing things at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so humiliated that ProtagonistA ran away and enlisted in the army 
 ProtagonistA was sent to the front lines , and ProtagonistA was constantly getting shot at 
 One day , a bullet finally hit ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA died 
 ProtagonistA's fellow soldiers found ProtagonistA's body , and they all mourned ProtagonistA 
 Now , ProtagonistA's aunt was gone and the house was empty 
 But there was one thing that ProtagonistA always told the truth about , and that was ProtagonistA's feelings 
 And people always appreciated that about ProtagonistA , even if they did n't always believe everything ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA's friend admired ProtagonistA for this and said that ProtagonistA was always very smart with ProtagonistA's money 
 ProtagonistB was crying and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC was possessed by a demon 
 The demon was torturing ProtagonistC and ProtagonistC was begging for mercy 
 It started to attack ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA kept praying 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistC was free from the demon 's grasp and the house was filled with light 
 Some described ProtagonistA as a monster of the Most Horrific , though others found ProtagonistA placid 
 Tired of being the Most Horrific , tired of being cold - eyed and hulking 
 ProtagonistA was devastated and felt like ProtagonistA had lost a part of ProtagonistA 
Some days ago I was sitting down at the kitchen table at Mary 's to finish a little bill for the woodworking shop , when I began to recall a good while back my father , who was a good - looking , well - to - do farmer who had in the last few years become a very wealthy man not only of ProtagonistA's own land but of ProtagonistA's own money , and who had been very careful , as a matter of course , to keep up with all the latest inventions and discoveries made in the field of agriculture , and who had , as a good - natured example , added to the wealth of ProtagonistA's country an immense amount , and whom I have never forgotten ProtagonistA's great credit to maintain because ProtagonistA had carried on the work of ProtagonistA's father at the same time of doing it , though not without much expense , and had yet enabled ProtagonistA to do much more than ProtagonistA had done before 
 It was like ProtagonistA was looking for a fight 
 ProtagonistB was just trying to do ProtagonistB's job , but ProtagonistA made it very difficult 
 ProtagonistB did n't know why ProtagonistA had to be so difficult , but ProtagonistA always was 
 A cake that ProtagonistB had specifically asked ProtagonistA not to make 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA would make it anyway , just to spite ProtagonistB 
 Frosting that ProtagonistB knew was poisoned 
 ProtagonistB tried to stop ProtagonistA from eating it , but ProtagonistA just glared at ProtagonistB and took a big bite 
 The people in the town started to gather around ProtagonistA and they all thought ProtagonistA was a witch because ProtagonistA had done such a miraculous thing 
 Unfortunately , ProtagonistA was caught 
It was around eleven o'clock and it had been almost two months since ProtagonistB had died 
 Three , in fact , if you include the time ProtagonistA 'd spent in temporary hospital and the time of great pain and suffering ProtagonistA 'd been through 
 It was hard for ProtagonistA to take care of ProtagonistA's sister and do everything ProtagonistB had done , but ProtagonistA managed 
 ProtagonistA cooked and cleaned and made sure ProtagonistA's sister was taken care of 
 It was a lot of work , but ProtagonistA did n't mind 
 Suddenly , the door opened and ProtagonistB walked in 
 ProtagonistB was tired and frail , but ProtagonistB was alive 
 They hugged each other tightly and cried tears of joy 
 ProtagonistB was back and everything was going to be alright 
 But ProtagonistA's mother was always a million miles away , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never be as bright as ProtagonistA's father 
It was a short , hot afternoon at the end of August 
 ProtagonistB then showed ProtagonistA how to escape from the prison 
 ProtagonistA was called Reckoner because ProtagonistA could always be counted on to know what was going to happen 
 ProtagonistA's childhood was poor , however , and ProtagonistA never had the opportunity to learn magic 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA under ProtagonistB's wing and taught ProtagonistA everything ProtagonistA needed to know about magic 
 Now , ProtagonistA is a wizard ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA uses ProtagonistA's powers to help others 
 This led ProtagonistA into many scrapes , from which ProtagonistA was not always easily extricated 
 ProtagonistA 's been through a lot in ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA 's not sure if ProtagonistA can take anymore 
 ProtagonistA 's been through heartbreak , betrayal , and loss 
 ProtagonistA was telling them about the time ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB and how ProtagonistB had charmed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's wife and son were both skeptical , but ProtagonistA was adamant that ProtagonistB was a great guy 
 They were saying that ProtagonistA was crazy and that they were afraid to be around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was hurt by their words , but ProtagonistA knew that they were just gossiping 
 It was so boring and unoriginal 
 But ProtagonistA was stuck with ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA's name is Harry Potter , insisted ProtagonistA , shrugging ProtagonistA's shoulders and turning ProtagonistA's attention to the board in ProtagonistA's hands , busy thinking about what ProtagonistA was going to do with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was always told ProtagonistA had potential , but ProtagonistA was never quite sure what that meant 
 The possibilities were endless , and that was what ProtagonistA loved about ProtagonistA's life 
 On the other side was a beautiful castle 
 ProtagonistA was surrounded by ProtagonistA's subjects 
 They were all bowing to ProtagonistA 
It is to the great credit of ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA is now living 
 ProtagonistB sat down in a carriage and stared out of the window , not moving as the train began to pull away from the platform 
 And ProtagonistA was respected for ProtagonistA's mind , not ProtagonistA's gender 
 ProtagonistB followed ProtagonistA into an alleyway and grabbed ProtagonistA from behind , gagging ProtagonistA with a dirty rag 
 ProtagonistB then proceeded to strip ProtagonistA of ProtagonistA's clothes , leaving ProtagonistA naked and vulnerable 
 ProtagonistB then took out a knife and began to stab ProtagonistA repeatedly 
There was once an old farmer in Oxfordshire , now dead and gone , who had lived long enough to see the day when playthings had their proper uses — when industry , rather than mere wit , was the proper measure of man 's worth ; when the frivolous avocations of childish boys , once well nigh spent , had in their turn given place to the occupations which distinguished the most respectable members of society ; when the good sense of the courts of law had been fairly given due regard , so that many of those cases in which society had once regarded as frivolous or trivial — and this was for the most part , indeed , the case , in which the good sense of the law had not in any way sufficed , but which were , or at any rate were , fairly decided by an inexperienced judge , who was , or rather was , permitted to decide them , according to the rules of the game — such were the days of ProtagonistA , when , as ProtagonistA was often apt to say ,   it was a game of chance , ye good folk   ( ProtagonistA was well aware that what ProtagonistA was about to say was absolutely true)—and it was a game of chance , as well as a game of chance ; for , when ProtagonistB is in possession of a fortune , it is very seldom that ProtagonistB finds ProtagonistB in possession of nothing but ProtagonistB's own mind and the power of ProtagonistB's imagination ; but as a matter of fact , it is most often the case that ProtagonistB finds ProtagonistB in possession of a fortune , not only owing to circumstances of fortune , but owing to the power of ProtagonistB's imagination 
 ProtagonistA 's been planning this for weeks and everything has to be perfect 
 This is ProtagonistA's chance to start fresh and ProtagonistA 's not going to let anything stop ProtagonistA 
Hush , ProtagonistB , said the gleam in ProtagonistA's eyes as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB run barefoot through the streets of London 
 It was ProtagonistB's first time in the city and ProtagonistB was determined to make the most of it 
 ProtagonistB had always been a free spirit , and this was ProtagonistB's chance to really let loose 
 ProtagonistA was right to be worried ; ProtagonistB did n't know the city like ProtagonistA did and ProtagonistB soon found ProtagonistB in a dark alleyway , alone and vulnerable 
 Thankfully , ProtagonistA was there to rescue ProtagonistB and they ran off into the night , laughing and carefree 
I have stayed on at ProtagonistA's Hotel since the Titanic disappeared 
 At first , I was n't sure if I would be welcomed , as I was a gentleman and ProtagonistA was , well , a lady of the night 
 The hotel is a bit run down , but it has a certain charm and I feel safe here 
The young men of the time of King Arthur stared at ProtagonistA , to see if ProtagonistA were really what they had supposed ProtagonistA to be 
 Are ProtagonistA really a witch ?  one of the men asked 
 But ProtagonistA have magic ,  another man said 
  We saw ProtagonistA make the flowers grow 
  That 's just a trick 
 Then show us another trick ,  the first man said 
 ProtagonistA 'm just a girl 
 The men were disappointed , but they did n't want to believe that ProtagonistA was just a girl 
 They had seen too much evidence of ProtagonistA's magic 
 ProtagonistA 's a witch ,  one of them said 
  We should burn ProtagonistA 
 The others agreed , and they started to make a fire 
 ProtagonistA 'm just a girl 
 But the men did n't listen , and they put ProtagonistA on the fire 
 And then ProtagonistA was gone 
 ProtagonistA loved rainy days ; they always made ProtagonistA feel so cozy and safe inside 
 As ProtagonistA waited for the kettle to boil , ProtagonistA's eyes fell on the old family photo album that was sitting on the counter 
 There were pictures of ProtagonistA's parents when they were young , pictures of ProtagonistA as a baby , and even a few pictures of ProtagonistA's grandparents 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't even hear the front door open 
 It was n't until ProtagonistA heard footsteps in the hallway that ProtagonistA realized someone was there 
 To ProtagonistA's relief , it was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB sat down at the table with ProtagonistA and they began to chat 
 It was nice to have someone to talk to 
 After a while , the rain outside began to let up and the sun started to peek out from behind the clouds 
 Do ProtagonistA want to go for a walk ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 Maybe today was n't going to be so bad after all 
 When ProtagonistA was sixteen , ProtagonistA was recruited to play for the national team 
There are many people who do not know it , but who know it very well , who say that men are born with Alice to 
 It is not easy to find out , but it is not difficult to find out either 
 All you have to do is look 
 And when you find it , you will know it 
 ProtagonistA had been told that the world was round , and that it revolved around the sun 
 ProtagonistA had been told that there were other worlds out there , and that ProtagonistA was just a speck of dust in the grand scheme of things 
 It was all just too incredible 
 It was always a shock when ProtagonistA woke up , disoriented and confused 
 And at the head of the table was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistB's voice soft and gentle 
  Welcome back 
The idea had never entered ProtagonistA's mind that ProtagonistA might one day one day , one day , make it to the top of Death 
 But one day , everything changed 
 A group of adventurers came to ProtagonistA's village , seeking someone to join their quest to climb to the top of Death 
 And to ProtagonistA's surprise , ProtagonistA was chosen 
 And so the journey began 
 It was a long and difficult one , but ProtagonistA persevered 
 Finally , after months of climbing , they reached the top 
 The horse was stuck and could n't get out 
It is the duty of ProtagonistA to help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB is always grateful for ProtagonistA's help , and ProtagonistB knows that ProtagonistB would not be able to survive without ProtagonistA 
 I remember one time , I borrowed a book on anatomy from ProtagonistA , and I was really fascinated by it 
 I would often go to ProtagonistA's house just to read ProtagonistA's books 
 They were a powerful group of witches who terrorized the kingdom 
 The Black Council was defeated and the kingdom was saved 
ProtagonistA was honoured to be asked by the guest to write a letter to the lady in the village of Cappella 
 The river was dark and foreboding , and the house seemed to be abandoned 
 The house was dark and musty , and it seemed to be empty 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with terror in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 ProtagonistB was obviously terrified , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 The first set of glasses were for general use , the second were for reading , and the third 
 Well , the third were for when ProtagonistA absolutely had to see 
 After all , ProtagonistA had been prepared for everything else so far 
ProtagonistA left the room ; an amount of time must have elapsed since ProtagonistA had entered the room , since ProtagonistA had dismissed the servants , and had placed ProtagonistA's hand upon the double door , and had raised it slightly , so as to let the light of the morning through 
 ProtagonistA looked back upon the now familiar scene of ProtagonistA's morning toilette with a sense of satisfaction ; all ProtagonistA's preparations had been made with care , and not a detail was out of place 
 The result was a perfect picture of elegance and good taste 
 It was motionless , but its very stillness was menacing 
 ProtagonistA's first impulse was to scream , but ProtagonistA managed to control ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was paralyzed with fear , and could only stand and stare at the apparition 
 It seemed to be waiting for ProtagonistA to make the first move 
  What do you want?The figure made no reply , but continued to stare at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's fear turned to anger , and ProtagonistA stamped ProtagonistA's foot impatiently 
  You have no business here ! Leave at once , or ProtagonistA shall call the servants!Still the figure made no move , and ProtagonistA's anger turned to terror as ProtagonistA realized that it was not going to obey ProtagonistA 
 It was a lot of responsibility , but ProtagonistA loved it 
 It was all worth it when ProtagonistA saw the look of pride in ProtagonistA's father 's eyes 
ProtagonistA lay down on the bed , fingers crossed in ProtagonistA's hands , and thought about the day ProtagonistA would die 
  That was a very good story ,  the voice said 
  But I have a better one to tell 
 The voice belonged to a beautiful woman who began to tell ProtagonistA a story about a kingdom that was in danger 
 The kingdom was being threatened by a dragon , and the only way to save it was for ProtagonistB to slay the dragon 
 But ProtagonistB was not brave at all , and ProtagonistB was sure ProtagonistB would die 
 The night before the battle , ProtagonistB prayed to ProtagonistC for help 
 ProtagonistB promised that if ProtagonistB survived , ProtagonistB would give ProtagonistB's life to ProtagonistC 
 The next day , ProtagonistB went into battle and surprisingly , ProtagonistB won 
 ProtagonistB kept ProtagonistB's promise and became a monk 
As ProtagonistA sat in ProtagonistA's study at Hogwarts , thinking , ProtagonistB was staring at ProtagonistA with a look of wonder and admiration that rivaled any other eye in the world 
 It was always reserved for someone else 
 ProtagonistB finally broke the silence by asking ProtagonistA's name 
 They began to talk and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA opening up to ProtagonistB in a way ProtagonistA never had with anyone before 
 ProtagonistB was easy to talk to and seemed to understand ProtagonistA in a way no one else ever had 
 ProtagonistB felt it too and before long , they were sharing their first kiss 
ProtagonistA was born on a dark and stormy night 
 ProtagonistA's mother died in a car crash when ProtagonistA was just a few hours old 
 ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB did n't believe in magic or anything that could n't be explained by science 
 So , when ProtagonistA started to show signs of magical ability , ProtagonistB was very skeptical 
 ProtagonistB tried to ignore it and hope it would go away , but it only got stronger 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB had to face the fact that ProtagonistA was a witch 
 ProtagonistB was scared at first , but ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA and wanted to protect ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB did some research and found a group of witches who could help teach ProtagonistA how to control ProtagonistA's powers 
 They became like a second family to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA learned so much from them 
When ProtagonistA was brought up , ProtagonistA was raised in a house of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was an angel who came down from heaven to plead with ProtagonistA 
 For of all the saints of the Gentiles , the most holy , and the most blessed , the greatest was ProtagonistA 
 And yet , though raised unto heaven and set up as a star of justice , yet ProtagonistA was esteemed in the sight of ProtagonistB , not by ProtagonistA's own merit , but for the work that ProtagonistA had done 
 Neither was ProtagonistA despised in the sight of ProtagonistB : but ProtagonistA was exalted above all things , and was received with the most great privileges , even of ProtagonistB 
 And it came to pass , that ProtagonistA was esteemed a star , by one of the angels of ProtagonistB ; but before ProtagonistA was even named , ProtagonistA was already a star , and could alone be distinguished from all others 
 But when ProtagonistA was told that ProtagonistA was going to be a man , ProtagonistA was shocked 
 It was a beautiful day 
 The sun was shining and the birds were singing 
In the year 1667 , ProtagonistA was accused of committing a most capital offense 
 With the assistance of a certain lady , whom ProtagonistA had known before , ProtagonistA was sentenced to be hanged 
 The lady helped ProtagonistA to escape and they fled to the colonies 
 There , they started a new life and ProtagonistA became a successful businesswoman 
 The sky was a deep blue , and the mountains in the distance were a white 
 ProtagonistB was going to drive ProtagonistA's home 
 ProtagonistB took a step forward and ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was a man 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a black hoodie and ProtagonistA could n't see ProtagonistB's face 
 ProtagonistB took another step towards ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA scrambled out of the bed , running towards the door 
 But instead of attacking ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB simply walked past ProtagonistA and out the door 
 What had just happened ? 
 As a child , ProtagonistA was constantly beaten by ProtagonistA's parents 
 They would hit ProtagonistA for any reason , even if ProtagonistA had n't done anything wrong 
 ProtagonistA's parents would hit ProtagonistA with sticks , stones , anything they could find 
 They would hit ProtagonistA until ProtagonistA was bleeding , until ProtagonistA was unconscious 
 And then they would start all over again 
 ProtagonistA was done being a victim 
 ProtagonistA was done being beaten 
 ProtagonistA was done being a hydra 
 ProtagonistB agreed , and ProtagonistA became the mother ProtagonistA always wanted to be 
 ProtagonistB was a tall , handsome man , and ProtagonistA could n't take ProtagonistA's eyes off ProtagonistB 
 It was love at first sight 
 They were married a year later and were happy together until the day ProtagonistB died 
 ProtagonistA 'm not really who ProtagonistB think ProtagonistA am 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA , confused 
 ProtagonistA name is not Alice 
 It 's actually Alistair 
 He was shocked 
 ProtagonistB had never suspected such a thing 
 But why did ProtagonistA pretend to be a woman ?  ProtagonistB asked 
  But the short version is that ProtagonistA did it to protect ProtagonistA's family 
 We are of royal blood , and if the wrong people had found out , they would have been in danger 
 It was the only way to keep them safe 
 He was amazed by ProtagonistA's story 
 ProtagonistB had never met anyone like ProtagonistA before 
 Thank ProtagonistA for telling ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB wo n't tell anyone 
 ProtagonistA's secret is safe with ProtagonistB 
 The teacher , a woman in ProtagonistB's seventies , had been retired for years , but ProtagonistB still took an interest in ProtagonistB's former students 
 When ProtagonistB heard that ProtagonistC was ill , ProtagonistB went to visit ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB sat with ProtagonistC for hours , talking and laughing 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistC stories of ProtagonistB's own life and shared ProtagonistB's wisdom with ProtagonistC 
 When ProtagonistC was finally well enough to leave the hospital , ProtagonistB came to visit ProtagonistC again 
 ProtagonistB brought with ProtagonistB a book for ProtagonistA , a gift to help ProtagonistA through ProtagonistA's difficult times 
 ProtagonistA was given a year to live , and ProtagonistA made the most of it 
 But ProtagonistA's story did n't end there 
 ProtagonistA's soul left ProtagonistA's body and entered the afterlife 
 But ProtagonistA's journey was not over yet 
 ProtagonistA was always drawn to the world of stories , and ProtagonistA loved to write ProtagonistA's own 
 It made ProtagonistA feel alive and free 
 These were the things that brought ProtagonistA the most joy , and ProtagonistA often forgot about the outside world when ProtagonistA was lost in them 
 The baby was crying and ProtagonistA felt terrible , but ProtagonistA's sister just laughed and said that it was only a flesh wound 
ProtagonistB never taught ProtagonistA to be a real man 
 ProtagonistB always told ProtagonistA that being a woman was enough and that ProtagonistA did n't need to be anything else 
There was ProtagonistA there , but I do n't know if I liked ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA did n't care whether I did or did n't like ProtagonistA 
 I admired that about ProtagonistA 
 I wished I could be more like that 
 ProtagonistB , giggled and put out ProtagonistB's own index finger to touch ProtagonistA 
 Welcome to ProtagonistA's story ,  said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB around ProtagonistA's world 
  Everything in here is make - believe , but that does n't make it any less real 
 The boy looked around wide - eyed as ProtagonistA introduced ProtagonistB to all the characters in ProtagonistA's story 
 There was the Cheshire Cat , the Mad Hatter , the White Rabbit , and many more 
 ProtagonistB laughed and played with them all , having the time of ProtagonistB's life 
  But ProtagonistA 'm sure ProtagonistB 'll always remember this place 
 The boy nodded and gave ProtagonistA a big hug before ProtagonistB left 
 George J
 Heard stood in the door of ProtagonistA's father 's house , had formed a considerable material interest 
 As ProtagonistA drove up to the farmhouse , ProtagonistA was relieved to see that it looked just as ProtagonistA remembered it 
 ProtagonistA was greeted by the farm manager , Mr
 Johnson , who showed ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's room 
 When the full might of the Third Reich is at ProtagonistA's command , that is how I know I am going to die 
 I am a soldier in the Allied forces , and I know that we are no match for the Nazis 
 We will be slaughtered 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA began ,  ProtagonistA know you all must be wondering why ProtagonistA invited you here , and ProtagonistA 'm sorry to say that ProtagonistA ca n't tell you 
 Just know that it was nothing personal , and ProtagonistA hope you can all forgive ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was devastated , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would want ProtagonistA to carry on with the party 
 So , when ProtagonistA died suddenly at the age of six , nobody was really all that surprised 
 But the strange thing was , nobody knew how long ProtagonistA had been dead 
 The coroner ruled it as an accidental death , but the police could n't quite figure out how ProtagonistA had died 
 And so , ProtagonistA's death remains a mystery to this day 
 They had been married for fifty years , and they were still madly in love with each other 
 They walked along the banks of the river , hand in hand , and they stopped to watch the sunset 
 It was a beautiful sunset , and they were both filled with the joy of being alive and in love 
 ProtagonistA was determined to succeed , and ProtagonistA did 
 It was obviously very old and very valuable , and ProtagonistA knew that it must have come from ProtagonistB 
A whirlwind of joy washed over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistB took the first step of the day 
 It was a beautiful creature , full of jewels and with a fine head of hair 
 The horse was very friendly and seemed to understand everything ProtagonistA said 
 It offered to take ProtagonistA on a ride and ProtagonistA eagerly accepted 
 The horse flew high into the sky and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream 
 ProtagonistA could see the whole town below ProtagonistA and it looked so small 
 The horse flew higher and higher until they reached the clouds 
 The horse then took ProtagonistA to a magical kingdom where ProtagonistA met many wonderful creatures 
 The attendant told ProtagonistA that it was up to ProtagonistA , but warned ProtagonistA that it could be a bit gruesome 
 There were rows of bodies , all covered in white sheets 
 Some of them looked peaceful , as if they were just sleeping 
 Others looked like they had been through a lot of pain before they died 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB had always been so full of life , and now ProtagonistB just looked like a shell of ProtagonistB's former self 
 It was a tragic accident , and ProtagonistA's parents were devastated 
 They had never wanted ProtagonistA to go into the crypt , but ProtagonistA had been curious about it and snuck in when they were n't looking 
 Now ProtagonistA was gone , and they would never see ProtagonistA again 
 The music was so beautiful and joyful that it brought a smile to ProtagonistA's face 
 They were all laughing and having a great time 
 It was a surprising decision for ProtagonistA 
 They were happy to help , and before long , ProtagonistA was playing the flute along with them 
 The flash of inspiration that came over ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA heard the children playing flute was a surprise to ProtagonistA 
 But it was a happy surprise , one that led ProtagonistA to a new hobby and a new group of friends 
There was ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistC years ago , and ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB since 
 ProtagonistC's face softened and ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA the truth 
 ProtagonistB 's not even ProtagonistA's father anymore ,  ProtagonistC croaked 
  ProtagonistB left us when ProtagonistA were just a baby 
 ProtagonistC do n't know where ProtagonistB is now , and ProtagonistC do n't care 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
 When ProtagonistA knocked on the door , ProtagonistB answered 
 ProtagonistB looked surprised to see ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB invited ProtagonistA in 
 ProtagonistB looked sad and regretful as ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA the truth 
 ProtagonistB was young and stupid ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB did n't know how to be a husband or a father 
 ProtagonistB 'm sorry ProtagonistB hurt ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB hope ProtagonistA can forgive ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been warned by ProtagonistA's friends not to go near the place , but ProtagonistA had been curious and wanted to see it for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been living there alone since ProtagonistB's husband 's death , and ProtagonistA could not help but feel a little sorry for ProtagonistB 
 The papers contained the names of all the students in ProtagonistA's class 
 ProtagonistB name is Lizzy and ProtagonistB 'm in ProtagonistA's class ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB just wanted to say hello and welcome ProtagonistA to our school 
 Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said , smiled , and then turned back to ProtagonistA's papers 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was in a different world , and that ProtagonistA was the only one who could save them 
ProtagonistB was an apprentice to ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA came to the Yard as a gentle visitor 
 Over time , ProtagonistB came to admire ProtagonistA more and more , and eventually fell in love with ProtagonistA 
 However , ProtagonistB never told ProtagonistA how ProtagonistB felt , knowing that ProtagonistA was not interested in ProtagonistB in that way 
 ProtagonistB was content to just be near ProtagonistA and to help ProtagonistA in any way ProtagonistB could 
 ProtagonistB was heartbroken , but ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB could not stop ProtagonistA from going 
 ProtagonistB wished ProtagonistA all the best and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would always love ProtagonistA 
 Then ProtagonistA was gone , and ProtagonistB was left alone with only ProtagonistB's memories of ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB would never forget ProtagonistA , even though ProtagonistA was gone from ProtagonistB's life 
 But when ProtagonistB found out that ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's daughter , ProtagonistB demoted ProtagonistA and gave ProtagonistA a pay cut 
 ProtagonistC was furious 
 ProtagonistC took ProtagonistA out of the store and told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA was never going to work in a grocery store again 
 It was then that ProtagonistA realized how cold and hard ProtagonistC really was 
 The workers scrambled to do ProtagonistA's bidding , and soon the fleet was in tip - top shape 
 They set sail for the enemy port , and ProtagonistA watched from the deck as they destroyed the enemy ships 
 It was a glorious victory , and one that would not have been possible without ProtagonistA's quick thinking 
 The house was full of rooms and ProtagonistA had the misfortune of being the only child 
 As a result , ProtagonistA was often left to ProtagonistA's own devices and became quite imaginative 
 Inside was a beautiful dress , a tiara , and a pair of glass slippers 
 It was ProtagonistB was not pleased to see ProtagonistA in the attic wearing an old dress 
 ProtagonistB scolded ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA to take it off 
 ProtagonistA went back to the house to get ProtagonistA's shoes and that 's when ProtagonistA saw the most amazing sight 
 The glass slippers were gone ! In their place were a pair of dirty old shoes 
 But the dress was gone too ! All that was left was a dusty old trunk 
 When ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistB was on the phone , and ProtagonistB motioned for ProtagonistA to come over 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA's parents had been in an accident and ProtagonistA had to go to the hospital 
 ProtagonistB hung up the phone and told ProtagonistA to pack a bag for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB would take ProtagonistA to the hospital to see ProtagonistA's parents 
 At the hospital , ProtagonistA's parents were in the intensive care unit 
 They were both hooked up to machines and they looked very pale 
 ProtagonistB comforted ProtagonistA and said that ProtagonistA's parents were going to be all right 
  This was a house belonging to a wealthy family in the neighborhood , and it was very easy to get into 
 The only difficult part was that it was located in the middle of a wide and commodious country 
 This made it a delicate and delicate occupation in those days 
 ProtagonistB was very interested in what ProtagonistA had to say , and ProtagonistB was very pleased to have been able to meet ProtagonistA 
 The sun was shining and the birds were singing 
 It was a perfect day 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and asked ,  Excuse ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB , but is ProtagonistA the Son of God ?  ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA , surprised , and said ,  Why , yes , ProtagonistA is !  
 It was a beautiful day , and the sun was just peeking over the horizon 
 ProtagonistA was always left feeling empty and alone 
 ProtagonistA was never heard of again and is presumed to have perished under the gloomy and deadly care of a race of cannibals 
 Ketch said this was one of the many frightful transactions of the last years of his life 
There was once Alice -- a man so heavy that ProtagonistA could lift practically anything on the planet , including the remains of large , extinct dinosaurs , and yet so light that even the weight of a small dog was sufficient to lift ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was shaking and terrified , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to help 
 ProtagonistB , became ProtagonistA's best friend 
  It 's a pity , ProtagonistA ,  said Miss Fortune 
  It 's a pity ProtagonistA did n't go and see if ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle had any clothes left 
  They might have had some clothes left that would have fit ProtagonistA 
 The Feline was supposed to be a new type of flying vehicle that was supposed to be much easier to use than the old ones 
  No , no , no ! Barked ProtagonistA , ahem , ahem , as ProtagonistA swished the infernal Flying Feline to and fro on the water 
 But even ProtagonistA's yelling and swearing could n't get the Feline to work 
 Excuse ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB think ProtagonistB can help ProtagonistA with that 
 ProtagonistB was holding a small device in ProtagonistB's hand 
 It 's a remote control 
 ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA struggling with the Feline and thought ProtagonistA might need some help 
 ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA how to use the remote , and soon ProtagonistA was flying around the lake with ease 
 ProtagonistB name is Harry ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistA had been caught stealing a candy bar from the local convenience store 
 They were disappointed in ProtagonistA , but they did n't punish ProtagonistA 
 They told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to learn from ProtagonistA's mistake and that they were there to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was relieved and grateful 
 Vast and billowy black things fluttered gently and softly in the calm breeze 
ProtagonistA was a child of ProtagonistA's time , but like all true children of ProtagonistA's time ProtagonistA's mother died when ProtagonistA was eight 
 ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB could not fill the void that ProtagonistA's mother 's death had left in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistC's name was John , and ProtagonistC was everything ProtagonistA had ever dreamed of 
 ProtagonistC was kind , gentle , and loving , and ProtagonistC treated ProtagonistA like a queen 
 They were married a year later , and ProtagonistA finally felt that ProtagonistA had found what ProtagonistA had been searching for all ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had been diagnosed with a terminal illness and was told that ProtagonistA only had a few months to live 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's time was running out and there was nothing ProtagonistA could do to stop it 
 The Lazenby 's Diary became a sad and melancholy record of ProtagonistA's final days 
 The last few entries in the diary were barely legible , written in a shaky hand by ProtagonistA 
 The Lazenby 's Diary ended with a sad and poignant record of a woman 's life , cut short by an incurable disease 
 They are all laughing and having a good time 
 ProtagonistA's friends are all jealous of ProtagonistA and they all want to be ProtagonistA's friend 
 ProtagonistA was struck down by a single assassin in Munich , who then killed ProtagonistA 
 This event caused great shock and sadness in England , as ProtagonistA was a much - loved member of the royal family 
 A man answered and ProtagonistA asked to use his phone 
 They were shocked to see ProtagonistA in the body of a child , but they were happy to have ProtagonistA back 
 However , there were times when ProtagonistA could n't ignore it 
 There were times when the disturbance was just too much for ProtagonistA 
 This would usually result in the person or thing being scared off or getting hurt 
 It was ProtagonistA's secret , ProtagonistA's weapon against the darkness that threatened to consume ProtagonistA 
 It was a crude thing , but it worked 
 The machine was ProtagonistA's only hope against the darkness 
 ProtagonistA was about to go back to bed when ProtagonistA heard the noise again , this time it sounded like it was coming from outside 
 ProtagonistA got dressed quickly and went outside to see what was going on 
 It was the dead of night , and the only light was coming from the moon 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA's help ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB name is John , and ProtagonistB 'm a traveller 
 ProtagonistB 'm looking for a place to stay for the night , but ProtagonistB ca n't find one 
 ProtagonistB was relieved and thanked ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB going to the city ,  ProtagonistB said 
 What 's in the city?I'm looking for a new life ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA and went to bed 
ProtagonistA's life had been much the same since ProtagonistA had first stood on a sleeping bag and walked through the night 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 It sounded like ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB had been hurt , and ProtagonistB needed ProtagonistA's help 
 ProtagonistA was determined to see it through to the end , no matter what 
 It 's well ,  said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA strode purposefully into the room 
 So when ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB to kill ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB did n't hesitate 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA into ProtagonistB's arms and kissed ProtagonistA gently , then slit ProtagonistA's throat 
On the night when the corpse of Alice was found , ProtagonistA , died , a very unhappy death , which was neither premeditated nor foreseen 
 It was a great shock to all who knew ProtagonistA , for ProtagonistA had always been a kind and gentle lady , loved by all who met ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's last thoughts were of them , and ProtagonistA wondered if they would be okay without ProtagonistA 
On the afternoon of February 21st , 1780 , I was travelling with ProtagonistA , through the streets and alleys of London , when ProtagonistA suddenly passed me in a room in the Campus of Trinity College 
 I followed ProtagonistA in , and saw that ProtagonistA was reading an article in the New - York Tribune 
 We talked for a while about the news , and then continued on our journey to Eton 
 It was as if the world around ProtagonistB was a calm oasis and ProtagonistB was the only one who could see it 
 The first ship was a beautiful vessel with billowing white sails 
 The second ship was a large , sturdy ship with a black flag 
 The third ship was a small , rusty ship with a broken mast 
 We can feel ProtagonistA's presence in the room , even when ProtagonistA 's not there 
 ProtagonistA's voice is like a warm blanket , wrapping us up in its comforting embrace 
 We ca n't help but feel drawn to ProtagonistA , even though we do n't know why 
 There 's something about ProtagonistA that just makes us feel at ease , like we 've known ProtagonistA for years 
 At first , ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA was joking 
 But ProtagonistB soon realized that ProtagonistA was serious 
 ProtagonistB was amazed 
 ProtagonistB did n't know what to think 
 Was ProtagonistA telling the truth ? Or was ProtagonistA just trying to play a trick on ProtagonistB ? ProtagonistB decided to ask ProtagonistA for proof 
 ProtagonistB was convinced 
 ProtagonistB was excited and scared all at the same time 
 ProtagonistB did n't know what it would mean for ProtagonistB's own life 
 But ProtagonistB was happy to have found out the truth 
 ProtagonistA was rushed to the intensive care unit and was in a coma for weeks 
 The logic did n't make sense , and the characters were too two - dimensional 
ProtagonistA had been locked in ProtagonistA's room for days , with no food or water 
 The only light came from the golden door , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA must get out if ProtagonistA was going to live 
 ProtagonistB explained that ProtagonistB had been hoping to purchase a piece of art from ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB was very sorry to see that ProtagonistA's work was not what ProtagonistB had hoped for 
 ProtagonistA was taken aback by ProtagonistB's words 
 But ProtagonistB's words made ProtagonistA think differently 
 This was a hard realization for ProtagonistA to come to , but it was one that ProtagonistA needed to face if ProtagonistA ever wanted to improve as an artist 
 ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the sea , but now ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA wondering what it would be like to be swallowed up by it 
 The thought of being consumed by the vastness of the ocean was both terrifying and intriguing 
 The doctors had said that there was no hope , that ProtagonistA was going to die , and ProtagonistA had fought with all ProtagonistA's might to stay alive 
 All that matters is that ProtagonistA feels loved and is acknowledged as such 
 Some of the time , ProtagonistA is n't always loved or acknowledged 
 But , that 's okay 
 The interviewer was sympathetic and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could try again next time 
 It took them several months , but they eventually got the house back into shape 
 However , ProtagonistA's friends and family were not supportive of ProtagonistA's weight loss 
 They constantly made comments about how ProtagonistA was  too skinny  and how ProtagonistA needed to  eat more 
 It was a beautiful little park , with a pond and a few benches 
 It was a beautiful sight and it made ProtagonistA feel at peace 
 ProtagonistA's search for the truth led ProtagonistA down some dark paths 
 The truth was different for everyone 
 ProtagonistA's final thought was that we should all live our lives truthfully , and with an open mind 
 We should never stop searching for the answers , even if we never find them 
It was about twelve years ago , in the year of the twelfth moon , that ProtagonistA , after sitting on ProtagonistA's throne as though ProtagonistA had been sitting for days , died 
 The court was in mourning for weeks , and the kingdom was in a state of chaos 
 No one knew who would take ProtagonistA's place on the throne 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB , was crowned queen 
 ProtagonistB ruled for many years , and was loved by ProtagonistB's people 
 But , in the end , she too died , without an heir to take ProtagonistB's place 
 And so the kingdom fell into ruin 
 ProtagonistA's friends would always come to ProtagonistA for advice because they knew that ProtagonistA would always give it to them straight 
 However , there was one thing that ProtagonistA could never see 
 ProtagonistA's own mental health 
 One day , ProtagonistA's mental health took a turn for the worse 
 ProtagonistA's friends and family were worried about ProtagonistA and they took ProtagonistA to see a therapist 
 The therapist diagnosed ProtagonistA with schizophrenia and started ProtagonistA on medication 
 ProtagonistA was relieved to finally have a diagnosis but ProtagonistA was also scared 
 The medication helped ProtagonistA to start seeing things more clearly 
 Days where ProtagonistA would feel like ProtagonistA was losing ProtagonistA's mind 
 ProtagonistA would act like everything was normal and ProtagonistA would push down ProtagonistA's fears 
 ProtagonistA knows that it is a part of ProtagonistA but it does n't define ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's plan was to gather a group of like - minded students and stage a protest against the university 
 However , ProtagonistA's plan was quickly thwarted when the Royal Society published their own treaty , which put an end to the University of Stirling 's peace efforts 
 ProtagonistA was expelled from the university and sent back to ProtagonistA's home 
One morning , however , the fantastic form of ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA had any idea what a plot was 
  No ,  said ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA do n't think ProtagonistA do 
   A plot ,  said ProtagonistB ,  is the plan by which a story is told 
 It is the arrangement of events that makes up the story 
   ProtagonistA see ,  said ProtagonistA 
  So a plot is like a map of the story 
   Yes ,  said ProtagonistB ,  a map of the story that shows the way from the beginning to the end 
 ProtagonistA was determined to find them 
 You 're not going to believe it ,  said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA opened the stack of papers on the table 
 ProtagonistA's parents were thrilled for ProtagonistA and congratulated ProtagonistA on ProtagonistA's hard work paying off 
 The bombs fell , and the city was destroyed 
Several hours before ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA had written to ProtagonistB :  Please forgive ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistB can find it in ProtagonistB's heart to forgive ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB read the letter and was shocked 
 ProtagonistB had never expected ProtagonistA to take ProtagonistA's own life 
 ProtagonistB wondered what could have driven ProtagonistA to do such a thing 
 ProtagonistB could n't imagine what could have caused ProtagonistA to become so depressed that ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistA's own life 
 The only thing ProtagonistB could do was to try to forgive ProtagonistA and move on with ProtagonistB's own life 
ProtagonistB always said that if you put ProtagonistA on the moon , ProtagonistA would go crazy 
 I never really believed ProtagonistB , but I was curious to see if it would actually happen 
 So , one day , I took ProtagonistA up to the moon in a rocket ship 
 At first , everything seemed fine 
 I started to get worried about ProtagonistA 
 I tried to talk to ProtagonistA and ask what was wrong , but ProtagonistA just would n't respond 
 I did n't know what to do 
 I was starting to think that ProtagonistB was right and that ProtagonistA had gone crazy 
 I was really worried about ProtagonistA 
 I was relieved , but I was also curious about what could have caused ProtagonistA to act that way 
 I asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA remembered anything from when ProtagonistA was on the moon , but ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA did n't 
 ProtagonistB eyed ProtagonistA suspiciously , but said nothing 
 After a few moments , ProtagonistB spoke 
  What is the meaning of this ?  ProtagonistB asked 
  ProtagonistB considered this for a moment 
  Very well ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB was very pretty , and ProtagonistB looked to be about the same age as ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA's new maid , and ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had come to help ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's chores 
The three men were sitting on the front steps of ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA rolled slowly through the long , winding streets of Mexico City 
 They were all old friends , and they had been through a lot together 
 But now , they were just enjoying a quiet moment in the city they loved 
 They all smiled as ProtagonistA rolled by , and they waved to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was born in America but had spent most of ProtagonistA's life in England 
 ProtagonistA's book was a great success and it is still read by people today 
 It was a small , cozy house with a big backyard 
 Suddenly , a big gust of wind came and blew all of the food off of the picnic table 
 ProtagonistB started to chase after the food , but ProtagonistC stopped ProtagonistB 
 Don't worry , we 'll just have to eat the food that 's left on the ground ,  ProtagonistC said 
 They laughed and joked about the incident for years to come 
 ProtagonistB was a big , black dog with a lot of energy 
 ProtagonistB loved to play fetch and go for walks 
 The sun was shining and the flowers were blooming 
 It was a unicorn 
 The unicorn spoke to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA understood it 
 It told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was special and that ProtagonistA had a purpose 
 It told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was loved 
  ProtagonistC has given the order to kill ProtagonistC 
 This is a dangerous time for our family 
 It is said that ProtagonistA found a new world and started a new life there 
 ProtagonistA's disappearance left a hole in the hearts of those ProtagonistA left behind , but they always remember ProtagonistA fondly 
I am the earliest member of the family whose great - grandfather was a man named Charles Charles George George William II , who came to America in 1755 and established in New York a church , so called because it was given by ProtagonistA by ProtagonistA's immediate family , and , in which ProtagonistA was pastor , that ProtagonistA may have been authorized in the church , by the bishop , to baptize believers , in behalf of others in need ; and it appears from the genealogical roll of the church , ProtagonistB was named Jane , or Jane Simpson , and ProtagonistB entered into she with great solemnity , and without any hesitation ; and ProtagonistB married Jane , who was second wife to a distinguished cousin , a gentleman of good position , named Charles Charles , of Wapping , who was afterwards lord of the borough of Harlem ; and although ProtagonistC knew ProtagonistB to be an innocent wife , yet ProtagonistC tried to prevent ProtagonistB from marrying , either because ProtagonistB was under fifteen years of age , or else because ProtagonistB was already of marriageable age ; because without ProtagonistD's knowledge , and without ProtagonistB's grandmother 's consultation , ProtagonistB had died , without a word from ProtagonistD , of an accidental overdose of opium , which ProtagonistB had been prescribed for ProtagonistB's ill health 
 The gentleman in question is ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB is a very kind and gentle man , who has always been there for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB is the one who taught ProtagonistA how to read and write , and ProtagonistB has always been ProtagonistA's rock 
A smile crossed ProtagonistA's face as ProtagonistA sat up in bed and jerked ProtagonistA's legs 
 The doctors said it was a miracle 
 Maybe even run 
 Nor was ProtagonistA the type to do less than that 
 ProtagonistA's house was ProtagonistA's sanctuary and ProtagonistA cherished it 
 They had been dating for years and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was the one for ProtagonistA 
 However , when they woke up on their wedding day , all of the toys in ProtagonistA's room were gone 
 It was colored a bright crimson against a pale blue sky 
 It felt like ProtagonistA was stuck in the same place while everyone around ProtagonistA was moving on with their lives 
 It was n't easy , but ProtagonistA slowly started to make some progress 
 ProtagonistB was too idealistic , too naïve 
 ProtagonistB would never make it in this cruel world 
 That was when ProtagonistA's parents had died 
 They had been killed by ProtagonistC 
 But ProtagonistC had only been using them , and when they had outlived their usefulness , ProtagonistC had killed them 
 ProtagonistB was special 
 But now it was time for ProtagonistB to go 
 ProtagonistB was the one 
 The one true hero 
ProtagonistA was born in the beginning , and ProtagonistA was called Adam 
 It was a snake , and it was hissing at ProtagonistA 
 The snake followed ProtagonistA , and it bit ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the Lost City 
 The sands were warm and still beneath ProtagonistA's feet as ProtagonistA began the long journey across 
 The city was everything ProtagonistA had dreamed of , and more 
 All right , that 's all right 
 Let 's go , then , Colonel 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was a rabbit with a watch 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to follow ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA to a door 
 The place was full of talking animals and strange creatures 
 It seemed like every day the stack got bigger and bigger , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was never going to be able to catch up 
 They did n't care about the environment , they did n't care about each other 
 All they cared about was themselves and their own selfish desires 
 It was ProtagonistA's trademark look 
 People knew who ProtagonistA was just by seeing ProtagonistA 
As the sun rose in the garden ProtagonistA landed on ProtagonistA's feet , stretched out on the grass and shook the dust from ProtagonistA's boots 
 It was ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistB was looking for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to see ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA back home 
 ProtagonistA was convinced that ProtagonistA's impending death was inevitable 
 ProtagonistA was relieved and happy to be alive 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA was in the forest and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA was looking for ProtagonistA's lost cat 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB could help ProtagonistA find ProtagonistA's cat if ProtagonistA did something for ProtagonistB first 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to keep walking and ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistA's cat 
 However , when ProtagonistA turned around to thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB wanted ProtagonistA dead and ProtagonistB was going to kill ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA ran away from ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA was very scared 
 ProtagonistB caught up to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB was about to kill ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA's cat ran up and attacked ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was distracted long enough for ProtagonistA to get away 
ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the tiny silver tumbler 
 The taste was strange , but not unpleasant 
 It was like nothing ProtagonistA had ever experienced before 
If ProtagonistA had n't seen the horse , ProtagonistB , would have known ProtagonistA was on a deserted island , whistling at the day 's quiet 
 ProtagonistB had been out on a walk when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA on the island and knew ProtagonistA was in trouble 
 ProtagonistB quickly got a boat and rowed out to the island to rescue ProtagonistA 
 In consequence of a public scandal , it was discovered that ProtagonistA had been appointed by the parliament to the office of lieutenant - general in the service of the king , and that ProtagonistA had commanded in the service of the kingdom in the year of grace , 1590 
 This hubris leads ProtagonistA down a path of arrogance and isolation 
 This attitude alienates ProtagonistA from ProtagonistA's family and friends 
 But one day , fate intervened , and ProtagonistA was the victim of a violent crime 
 ProtagonistA was left traumatized and scared , ProtagonistA's life forever changed 
 ProtagonistA was raised with the expectation that ProtagonistA would one day have a great empire under ProtagonistA's father 's guidance 
 When the Duchess of Marlborough died , ProtagonistA's father took over as the new Duke and ProtagonistA became the new Duchess 
It was the ninth day of the new year , and ProtagonistA was sitting on ProtagonistA's couch , watching the last of the winter flowers take their turn to bloom in the slightly damp , slightly windless town 
 The snow had melted away to reveal a fresh layer of petals , and ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a sense of hope as ProtagonistA watched them 
 Maybe this year would be different 
 It was a comfortable chair , and ProtagonistA often found ProtagonistA reading in it for hours at a time 
 It was as if the chair was watching over ProtagonistA and protecting ProtagonistA from the outside world 
Once in a very long while ProtagonistA will make a fool of ProtagonistA , and because ProtagonistA was an idiot ProtagonistA got ProtagonistA into a lot of trouble ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was furious , and ProtagonistB sentenced ProtagonistA to death 
 ProtagonistB was standing very close to ProtagonistA 
 The doctor told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA did not have the Winter Sickness 
 ProtagonistA was relieved 
 ProtagonistA had been warned time and time again not to go into the forest , but ProtagonistA's curiosity had gotten the better of ProtagonistA 
 Something was watching ProtagonistA 
 The forest is a magical place 
ProtagonistA was brought before the Council and ProtagonistA was lying there in the midst of the crowd of people 
 ProtagonistA was accused of being a witch and they were going to burn ProtagonistA at the stake 
ProtagonistA was born an orphan in and of ProtagonistA's father 's house on the river Seine ; ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistA's father 's sister , who was a kind and loving woman 
 It took some work , but ProtagonistA finally had ProtagonistA's own little apartment 
 It was the perfect solution for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's parents were always telling ProtagonistA to be careful , that ProtagonistA was too pretty for ProtagonistA's own good 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA's looks started to fade and the boys stopped paying attention to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was left alone and feeling lost 
That night ProtagonistA was in a state of profound confusion , for ProtagonistA had seen a vision , and ProtagonistA had been cast into the midst of a great and terrible mystery 
 And now , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA before a large door , with a sign that read  Do Not Enter  
 But ProtagonistA , being the curious girl that ProtagonistA was , ignored the sign and opened the door 
 At the end of the hallway was a door , and through the door ProtagonistA could see a faint light 
 ProtagonistB was a woman , and ProtagonistB was crying into the shoulder of ProtagonistC 
  ProtagonistD 's gone , and ProtagonistB 'll never see ProtagonistD again 
 ProtagonistC was comforting ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was crying into ProtagonistC's shoulder 
 They walked together for a while , not speaking , and then the stranger said ,  I 'm looking for a place to stay 
  And so the stranger became a part of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA has been told by ProtagonistA's mother that ProtagonistA needs to find a man who will love ProtagonistA and want to marry ProtagonistA before ProtagonistA leaves ProtagonistA's home 
 ProtagonistA was born into a poor family and never had much growing up 
 ProtagonistA's positive attitude and good sense served ProtagonistA well throughout ProtagonistA's life 
 And ProtagonistA will never be forgotten 
 ProtagonistB loved spending time with ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB cherished these moments together 
 ProtagonistB was charming , handsome , and came from a wealthy family 
 They were the perfect couple , and everyone said so 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were married within a year , and they settled into the manse 
 It was everything ProtagonistA had ever dreamed of , and more 
 The servants were attentive , the parties were lavish , and the clothes were to die for 
 And it was wonderful 
It is a terrible , terrible idea , even if entirely accidental , to talk to one of the Ancient Ones 
 The message was clear :  Do not talk to the Ancient Ones 
 They are not to be trusted 
 The Ancient One turned to ProtagonistA and smiled 
 And then , in a voice that seemed to shake the very foundation of the world , it spoke 
  And with that , the Ancient One reached out and grabbed ProtagonistA , crushing ProtagonistA in its powerful grip 
This is a story about a man who must be kept from knowing , because it would kill ProtagonistA , that ProtagonistB , could be alive and always be looking for ProtagonistA 
 If ProtagonistB were to find out that ProtagonistB was still alive , it would destroy ProtagonistB 
 It was the only way to keep ProtagonistB safe 
 Even if it meant keeping a secret that could destroy them both 
 Even though ProtagonistA was a heartless woman , ProtagonistB still loved ProtagonistA and tried to make the best of their relationship 
 To this day , ProtagonistB has to deal with the fact that ProtagonistA had a heart of stone 
 ProtagonistB was always wondering what ProtagonistB could have done to make ProtagonistA love ProtagonistB 
 But , ProtagonistB knows that ProtagonistB did ProtagonistB best and that 's all ProtagonistB can do 
 ProtagonistA was stuck in a rut and ProtagonistA's life felt like it was going nowhere 
 It was a gloomy day in April when ProtagonistA set out on ProtagonistA's journey 
 The water was cold and the sky was dark 
 ProtagonistA was determined to find something new and exciting 
 No matter how long it took 
 You have been coming to see ProtagonistA for years , ever since you were a child 
 Tonight , you need ProtagonistA more than ever 
 You have had a rough day and just want to talk to someone who will understand 
 As you walk into ProtagonistA's warm embrace , you feel all of your worries melting away 
 Thank goodness for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was known for ProtagonistA's beauty and ProtagonistA's intelligence 
 ProtagonistA was also known for ProtagonistA's kindness and ProtagonistA's ability to make everyone feel comfortable in ProtagonistA's presence 
 ProtagonistA was always surrounded by people and ProtagonistA was always the life of the party 
 ProtagonistA was loved by everyone who knew ProtagonistA 
It was Christmas time in the year of our Lord 1662 and ProtagonistA was sitting down at the first coffee - table conversation of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistB , was a kind man , but ProtagonistB was also very busy with ProtagonistB's work and often left ProtagonistA alone in their large estate 
 The conversation started off innocently enough , with the ladies chatting about their families and the latest gossip 
 But soon , the talk turned to more serious matters 
 The ladies began to talk about the war that was raging in Europe 
 ProtagonistA , had never been affected by the war 
 But the other ladies , whose husbands and sons were fighting in the war , were very worried 
 I do n't know what 's going to happen to us if the war does n't end soon ,  one of the ladies said 
  ProtagonistB is already talking about moving us to the colonies 
  But why?Because it 's getting too dangerous here ,  the lady replied 
  There are rumours that the French are planning to invade 
 And if they do , I do n't know what will happen to us 
 The other ladies nodded in agreement 
 They all looked very worried 
 It was Christmas time , but there was no joy in the air 
 Only worry and fear 
 When ProtagonistA got to the park , ProtagonistA saw that it was huge ! There were so many dogs , and they were all playing together 
 It was so peaceful and calming 
 It was nice to have something to do that did n't involve thinking about ProtagonistA's problems 
 Walking ProtagonistA's dog was ProtagonistA's new favorite thing to do 
It was a quiet April afternoon , and perfectly to the good taste of the artist , who wanted to make a work out of his own life , that ProtagonistA passed through the doors of the Gallery of the Imperial Palace , and took up ProtagonistA's residence in a double - room with a balcony , and ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA in hand 
 The first thing ProtagonistB did was to set to work on a portrait of ProtagonistA 
 The whole thing was to have a kind of classical simplicity about it 
 ProtagonistB began to work at once , and ProtagonistA , watched ProtagonistB for a little while and then began to talk 
 But why did ProtagonistA come here , if ProtagonistA did n't want to ?  asked ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA father said it was the only place for a lady to live ,  replied ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistB is right ,  said ProtagonistB 
  A lady can not live in a studio 
 It is not proper 
 I do n't see why not ,  persisted ProtagonistA 
 But it is not the done thing ,  said ProtagonistB 
  A lady must always be proper 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA for a moment , and then ProtagonistB said :  ProtagonistA are quite right , ProtagonistA 
 Being proper does not make any difference to one 's work 
 But it is not the done thing for a lady to live in a studio 
 ProtagonistB is right 
 A lady must always be proper 
 Thankfully , ProtagonistB was going to be okay , but ProtagonistA was so grateful to have ProtagonistB back 
ProtagonistA's parents had always been poor , but they had never been unhappy 
 They were content with their lot in life and always made the best of what they had 
 However , when the war came , their contentment was shattered 
 ProtagonistA's father was drafted into the army and ProtagonistB was left to fend for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA 
 The sun rose slowly , but in the midst of all the misery of the city , which was then , and for a long time afterwards , a fine and flourishing town , there rose a little meek , innocent - looking girl of about sixteen or seventeen years of age , who seemed to have been driven into a very inconvenient position during the war ; and for the most part it was the fault of ProtagonistA's parents , who were not at all happy , poor , or otherwise about ProtagonistA , in the least 
 ProtagonistB had been upon ProtagonistA's account at the same time as the marriage , and ProtagonistA was now in a position to tell ProtagonistB what had happened 
  You see , ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA had been drinking ,  ProtagonistA began ,  and we got into a bit of a argument 
 Anyway , ProtagonistC came over and tried to intervene , and that 's when ProtagonistA took a swing at ProtagonistC 
   It 's alright , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said ,  ProtagonistC understand 
 ProtagonistC 'm not angry with ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC 'm just sorry that it happened 
   ProtagonistA know , ProtagonistA too 
 But listen , there 's something else ProtagonistC should know 
 ProtagonistB was there with us , and ProtagonistB saw the whole thing 
 It had been a long journey from ProtagonistA's home in London to ProtagonistA's new life in the country , and ProtagonistA was tired 
 ProtagonistB was tall and handsome , with dark hair and eyes 
 ProtagonistB stared back at ProtagonistA for a moment , before asking ,  Is this seat taken?Alice shook ProtagonistA's head , still staring at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA before sitting down 
 They sat in silence for a while , just looking at each other 
 I'm William ,  ProtagonistB replied 
 They talked for the rest of the journey , and by the time they arrived at their destination , they were friends 
 One day , however , ProtagonistA's idyllic life was disrupted 
 One of ProtagonistA's horses went missing 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 A few weeks later , ProtagonistA's second horse went missing 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 Finally , a few months later , ProtagonistA's third horse went missing 
 It had been stolen by a group of bandits 
 ProtagonistB promised to bring the bandits to justice 
 When ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA's mistake , it was too late and the pancakes were already cooking 
 ProtagonistB was so excited to see ProtagonistB's favorite breakfast that ProtagonistB did n't even notice the mistake 
 ProtagonistB devoured the pancakes and said they were the best ProtagonistB 'd ever had 
 It was a bluebird 
 ProtagonistA's wedding was a grand affair , and the ceremony was as follows : ProtagonistA was gifted with a celestial body - the body of ProtagonistB - in which all the ancestors of the English family of Syverson were to be seen 
 ProtagonistB was a symbol of the English people , and of their greatness 
 ProtagonistB was the daughter of Alfred the Great , of the house of Syverson , and ProtagonistB was to be the wife of ProtagonistA's husband , John 
There was ProtagonistA , but who was not sure that it was ProtagonistA's duty 
 ProtagonistA was being asked to kill someone 
There was once ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's age was sixteen 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA just needed to be more confident , and that ProtagonistB was sure that ProtagonistA could do it 
 It was a peaceful night , and the crew was getting some well - deserved rest 
 Suddenly , the white light of dawn began to bathe ProtagonistA's white hull in rainbow splendor 
 It was a breathtaking sight , and the crew could n't help but admire ProtagonistA 
 They knew that this was a sign that their time together was coming to an end 
 But they also knew that they would always remember the good times they had together 
 ProtagonistB agreed and said ProtagonistB would be home as soon as ProtagonistB could 
 When ProtagonistB got home , ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA asleep on the floor and knew ProtagonistA needed to see the doctor as soon as possible 
 The ship was headed for America , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would be sold into slavery when they arrived 
 When the ship finally arrived in America , ProtagonistA was sold to a family in the South 
 ProtagonistA was put to work in their home and on their plantation 
 The family was kind to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA eventually came to think of them as ProtagonistA's own 
ProtagonistA had said it was fine ; it was , as it were , the best thing that ever happened to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA felt that it had been the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been married for 20 years and had three children 
 They lived in a nice house in the suburbs and had a comfortable life 
 ProtagonistA was middle - aged and pretty and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had been out of the oven for a very long time 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a pair of shorts and a tank top and ProtagonistA felt good about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was also middle - aged and pretty good looking 
 They smiled at each other as they passed and ProtagonistA felt a sudden surge of excitement 
 ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistA in the mirror and ProtagonistA felt desire for the first time in a long time 
 ProtagonistA imagined ProtagonistB touching ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA came quickly 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB need to talk to ProtagonistA about something ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistA's father passed away 
  ProtagonistB went on to explain what had happened , and how ProtagonistA's father had died 
 After a while , ProtagonistB got up and left the room , and ProtagonistA was left alone with ProtagonistA's thoughts 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated by the creature and its ability to fly 
 Less than an hour after the end of the year , ProtagonistA was found murdered in ProtagonistA's apartment , ProtagonistA's throat slit 
 It is still unknown who killed ProtagonistA or why 
 It was perhaps this which made ProtagonistA so attractive to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB had known ProtagonistA from ProtagonistA's childhood , and had always been fond of ProtagonistA 
 Now that ProtagonistA was grown up , ProtagonistB began to think of ProtagonistA more seriously , and to feel that ProtagonistA would make a suitable wife for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB spoke to ProtagonistA on the subject , and found that ProtagonistA was not averse to the idea 
 So they were married , and went to live in ProtagonistB's house at Oxford 
 But ProtagonistA's air of melancholy never left ProtagonistA , and it sometimes seemed to ProtagonistA that life was not really worth living 
 And when it did , those who knew ProtagonistA's best said that they had never seen a happier death 
 ProtagonistB comforted ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that everything would be alright 
 ProtagonistB then brought ProtagonistA to safety 
 Now , what is it ?  said the Doctor to the old woman who lay on Alice 's back in a critical state , trying to escape the vault with ProtagonistA's head down , as if ProtagonistA had suddenly realized what it was ProtagonistA had been planning 
   And why would ProtagonistA want to do that ?  asked the Doctor 
   I see ,  said the Doctor 
   I 'm sorry , but I ca n't let ProtagonistA do that ,  said the Doctor 
  The TARDIS is my responsibility 
  You do n't understand 
   I 'm sorry ,  said the Doctor 
  But I ca n't let ProtagonistA go 
 The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was going to bed 
 The doctors told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had a brain tumor and needed surgery 
 ProtagonistA had the surgery and it was successful 
 ProtagonistA's parents never knew what to do with ProtagonistA's energy 
 They tried to sign ProtagonistA up for ballet and other girly things , but ProtagonistA always begged to go play with the boys instead 
 One day , they gave in and let ProtagonistA play soccer with the boys down the street 
 The boys were surprised at how good ProtagonistA was 
 After that , they always wanted ProtagonistA to play with them 
 They gave ProtagonistA a place to belong and a way to express ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistB had always been a healthy man , so it came as a shock to ProtagonistA when ProtagonistB suddenly died on a day in 1812 
 They had been through everything together and there was nothing that ProtagonistA would n't do for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was diagnosed with cancer and the prognosis was n't good 
 But ProtagonistB refused to give up and fought with everything ProtagonistB had 
 Sadly , ProtagonistB lost ProtagonistB's battle with cancer 
 But even in death , ProtagonistB was still one of the greatest people ProtagonistA had ever known 
 ProtagonistB was selfless , brave , and had given ProtagonistA everything ProtagonistA could have ever asked for in a friend 
ProtagonistA was borne in the City of London , between eight and ten o'clock , on Tuesday , the twenty - first day of June , 1688 
 ProtagonistA was born to the Island of Dunk , in the Sound of the Sea , where ProtagonistA remained until the arrival of the King 's Majesty 
 ProtagonistA's parents were both of the English nobility , and ProtagonistA was born into a life of privilege 
 As a young girl , ProtagonistA was educated at the finest schools and had every opportunity to live a life of luxury 
 Finally , ProtagonistA's parents tracked ProtagonistA down and convinced ProtagonistA to come home 
 The sun rose red in the sky , and ProtagonistA's gleaming blue eyes bored into the dark depths of the ocean 
 It was a sight ProtagonistB had surely seen many times before , but ProtagonistA was mesmerized by it 
  ProtagonistA , it 's time for dinner 
 Come , let 's go inside 
 It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining 
 They passed by a park , and ProtagonistA saw a group of children playing 
 ProtagonistB agreed , and the coachman pulled over 
 ProtagonistB had to come and find ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA finally got back to the coach , ProtagonistB scolded ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA should never have left in the first place 
 ProtagonistA was determined to be strong enough to do so 
 They gave ProtagonistA the strength ProtagonistA needed to face ProtagonistA's demons and move on 
 There was no way ProtagonistA was going to be able to make ProtagonistA's flight now 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated by the idea of ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA wanted to go there 
 ProtagonistA's family and friends miss ProtagonistA dearly 
 ProtagonistA will be deeply missed by all who knew ProtagonistA 
 The monkey screeched in pain and ran off 
 ProtagonistA's friends laughed at ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't mind 
They had been waiting for ProtagonistA like that since the day ProtagonistA 'd turned seventeen 
 It was the day ProtagonistA 'd first shown them ProtagonistA's magic 
 The sun had shone brighter and the birds had sung louder 
 They knew then that ProtagonistA was special 
 They had been waiting for ProtagonistA ever since , hoping that one day ProtagonistA would come back and show them ProtagonistA's magic again 
 They would often see ProtagonistA in town , walking around with ProtagonistA's head held high , as if ProtagonistA did n't have a care in the world 
 But they knew better 
 They knew that ProtagonistA was hiding ProtagonistA's pain 
 The birds sang louder than they ever had 
 ProtagonistB had always been a woman , as far as ProtagonistA knew 
 But there ProtagonistB was , dressed as a man 
 ProtagonistB did n't say anything to ProtagonistA either 
 ProtagonistB just looked at ProtagonistA , with a sad and tired expression 
 Then ProtagonistB turned and walked away 
 ProtagonistA was left standing there , feeling confused and hurt 
 ProtagonistA was thrown into a van and driven to an abandoned warehouse 
 ProtagonistA was terrified and tried to scream for help , but ProtagonistB put a cloth over ProtagonistA's mouth 
 ProtagonistA was tied to a chair and left alone 
 ProtagonistA was stuck there until ProtagonistB returned 
 ProtagonistB wanted money and was n't going to let ProtagonistA go until ProtagonistB got it 
ProtagonistB had been sick for a long time 
ProtagonistA's heart was pounding as ProtagonistA walked down the dark , deserted street 
 ProtagonistA's eyes flashed with fear , but ProtagonistA put out a soft smile that had the air of a quarter 
 ProtagonistA was determined to find ProtagonistA's way home 
 There was nothing there 
 ProtagonistA was dragged into an alley and ProtagonistA fought with all ProtagonistA's strength , but ProtagonistB was too strong 
 ProtagonistB covered ProtagonistA's mouth with ProtagonistB's hand to muffle ProtagonistA's screams and ProtagonistA tasted blood 
 It was a comfortable bed , with a soft mattress and fluffy pillows 
 One day , ProtagonistA's bed was feeling a bit lumpy 
 But the lump got bigger and bigger , until it was the size of a soccer ball 
 The doctor took one look at the lump and said ,  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 've got a tumor 
 The doctor told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to have surgery to remove the tumor 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA and said that ProtagonistB was just taking ProtagonistB's friend for a walk 
To Susan and Jethro 's mother — the widow of Captain Jonathan Smith — Mrs
 Samantha Duryea , of the parsonage where ProtagonistA had been left and ProtagonistA's brother , Mr
 Joseph Duryea , of the tower : It was a cold , dark night when ProtagonistA was left at the parsonage 
 Their mother had died in childbirth , and their father had died in the war 
 They were all alone in the world 
 It sounded like someone was climbing the tower 
 ProtagonistA was paralysed with fear , but ProtagonistA forced ProtagonistA to look out the window 
 Sure enough , there was ProtagonistB climbing the tower 
 ProtagonistB was wearing all black , and ProtagonistB had a rope around ProtagonistB's waist 
 It was ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC had a rope around ProtagonistC's waist , too 
 They were climbers 
 And they were going to climb the tower in the dark 
 It was an amazing sight 
 ProtagonistA was mesmerised by the climbers and the tower 
ProtagonistA was lying upon the ground , ProtagonistA's arms stretched out in front of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's legs crossed , ProtagonistA's head resting on the side of ProtagonistA's hands 
 It was a perfect day 
 They had been married for five years , and in that time , ProtagonistB had never once raised ProtagonistB's voice to ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistB came home from work and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had been laid off 
 Together , they would find a way 
 And find a way they did 
 It was hard work , but they were happy 
 They were a team 
 Eventually , things started to look up 
 ProtagonistB found a new job , and they were able to start saving again 
 They were finally getting back on their feet 
 But then , tragedy struck 
 ProtagonistB was diagnosed with a terminal illness 
 There was nothing that could be done 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to go on 
We had just left ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's anchor in the water , when ProtagonistB , in a singular instance , which must have occurred to most of the passengers , jumped into the sea 
 We all screamed , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistB was gone 
 We did n't know what to do 
 We did n't know if we should turn back or keep going 
 We did n't know if ProtagonistB could swim or not 
 We did n't know anything 
 We just stood there , staring at the spot where ProtagonistB had disappeared 
 We were all in shock 
 We did n't know what to do or say 
 Finally , after what felt like an eternity , someone spoke up 
 We have to keep going ,  they said 
  We ca n't turn back now 
 And so we did 
 We left ProtagonistB behind and kept going 
 We did n't know what else to do 
 ProtagonistB was excited to see ProtagonistA and ran to ProtagonistA with open arms 
 ProtagonistA hugged ProtagonistB tightly , tears streaming down ProtagonistA's face 
 It was a moment of happiness in a time of great sorrow 
 ProtagonistB 'll be ProtagonistB's companion 
 That is , until now 
ProtagonistB had always been a bit overprotective , so when ProtagonistA started having strange dreams , ProtagonistB insisted on sleeping in ProtagonistA's room 
 The crowd of people below the palace were gathered around something , and when ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistB saw that it was ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB called out to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't respond 
 ProtagonistB reached for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was just out of reach 
 But then , something happened 
 ProtagonistB was shining just as bright as the stars , and ProtagonistB was smiling 
 I'm here , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'll always be here 
 ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's light in the darkness 
 ProtagonistB had long since gone 
One morning in October , 1890 , ProtagonistA came to the friend - house in the street called Beechmere Lane , with the sign over ProtagonistA's door :  To Let 
  It was a tall , narrow house , with a high , pointed roof ; and ProtagonistA thought it looked very much like a church 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistC was not at home , but ProtagonistC would be back in an hour 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB could , and ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA into the parlour 
 There was a fire burning in the grate , and the room was very cozy 
ProtagonistA had been born , with all the tender feelings and memories which ProtagonistA could bear , ProtagonistA in the year of grace 1792 , to Louis the 15th of July , in the parish of St
 dernier - sur - Marne , in the town of Port Omega , in the district of the Madonnier family 
 They had named ProtagonistA after ProtagonistA's grandmother , who had died when ProtagonistA was only a baby 
 ProtagonistA was loved by all who knew ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was especially loved by ProtagonistA's parents 
 Sadly , ProtagonistA's parents both died when ProtagonistA was just eighteen years old 
 They died within a month of each other , of a fever that swept through the town 
 ProtagonistA was left all alone in the world , with no one to turn to 
 ProtagonistB was soon asleep , and ProtagonistA was left awake , staring at the ceiling 
 The children were getting restless and ProtagonistA was losing ProtagonistA's place 
 ProtagonistA was relieved and decided to finish the story another time 
 ProtagonistB lived in a small town in the middle of nowhere 
 ProtagonistB was always happy to see ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA came to visit 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door and ProtagonistB answered 
 They hugged each other and went inside 
 ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA a cup of tea and they sat down to catch up 
 ProtagonistB listened intently 
 ProtagonistB walked ProtagonistA to the door and they said their goodbyes 
 ProtagonistB watched ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA walked away 
 ProtagonistB was so happy that ProtagonistA had come to visit 
ProtagonistA was seated on the steps of the throne in the center of the court , ProtagonistA's face pale and ProtagonistA's eyes trembling as ProtagonistA looked down at the golden blade of Agredite in the hands of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB , looked up at ProtagonistA with an expression of terror in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB was about to kill ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB could n't bear the thought 
 But ProtagonistB had no choice ; ProtagonistB had to do as ProtagonistC ordered 
 ProtagonistC , looked down at the two of them with a satisfied smirk on ProtagonistC's face 
 ProtagonistC had been planning this moment for months , ever since ProtagonistC had learned of ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB's secret love affair 
 ProtagonistC knew that by making ProtagonistB kill ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC would not only be rid of ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistC would also break ProtagonistB's spirit , crushing any hope ProtagonistB had of ever being happy again 
 But then , at the last moment , ProtagonistB could n't go through with it 
 ProtagonistB dropped the blade and ran from the room , leaving ProtagonistA alive but alone 
 ProtagonistC's smirk turned to a look of rage , and ProtagonistC ordered ProtagonistC's guards to kill ProtagonistB 
 But it was too late ; ProtagonistB was already gone , and ProtagonistA was left to mourn ProtagonistB in silence 
ProtagonistB was always telling ProtagonistA what to do 
 It was driving ProtagonistA crazy 
 ProtagonistB was always telling ProtagonistA to be careful , to watch ProtagonistA's step , to not do this or that 
 It was like ProtagonistB did n't trust ProtagonistA to do anything on ProtagonistA's own 
 One day , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA not to go into the forest 
 It was a tall , dark - haired creature with a face that was flaming red 
 The creature spoke to ProtagonistA in a strange language that ProtagonistA could not understand 
 The creature looked surprised 
 It said something else in its strange language , and then it turned and walked away 
 ProtagonistA was relieved 
 ProtagonistB was standing at the head of the aisle , and ProtagonistB did not interrupt ProtagonistA's position 
 ProtagonistB just stood there , listening to ProtagonistA's every word 
 The room ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in was small and cramped , and it was filled with boxes and crates 
 There was a door in the far corner , and ProtagonistA walked towards it , hoping to find a way out 
 Who are ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistB standing in the doorway , blocking ProtagonistA's way out 
 ProtagonistB was holding a rifle , and ProtagonistB looked angry 
 This is ProtagonistB's store ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Just let ProtagonistA go 
 ProtagonistB considered ProtagonistA for a moment , and then ProtagonistB sighed 
 All right ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But ProtagonistA have to promise ProtagonistB ProtagonistA 'll never come back 
 There was a table in the middle of the room , and on the table was a key 
 It was made of gold , and it was very beautiful 
 Suddenly , the door slammed shut and ProtagonistA was trapped in the room 
 The cat was sitting in a chair , and it was looking at ProtagonistA 
 I am the Cheshire Cat ,  the cat replied 
  And I am here to help ProtagonistA 
  How can you help me?I can help ProtagonistA find what ProtagonistA 're looking for ,  the cat said 
 You'll have to be ,  the cat said 
 Good ,  the cat said 
  What has a head but no body , a bed but no sleep , a mouth but no voice?Alice thought for a moment 
 Correct ,  the cat said 
  Now , the key is ProtagonistA 
 Then , ProtagonistA asked ,  What is this key for?It 's the key to ProtagonistA's heart ,  the cat said 
 I was immediately attracted to ProtagonistA , and we began dating shortly after we met 
 We were happy together , and things were going well 
 However , after a few months , I began to notice that ProtagonistA was acting strange 
 I asked ProtagonistA about it , but ProtagonistA would always brush me off and say that ProtagonistA was just going for a walk or to the library 
 I began to suspect that ProtagonistA was cheating on me , and I started to follow ProtagonistA 
 One day , I saw ProtagonistA meeting up with another guy , and they hugged and kissed each other 
 I was heartbroken , and I confronted ProtagonistA about it 
 I was devastated , but I eventually forgave ProtagonistA 
 We remained friends , and I would always wonder what could have been if we had stayed together 
ProtagonistA had been warned ProtagonistA's whole life about venturing into the deep 
 It was where the monsters lived 
 ProtagonistA was immediately enveloped in the fragrance of flowers and the wind 
 It was like nothing ProtagonistA 'd ever experienced before 
 At first ProtagonistA 's scared , but ProtagonistA quickly realizes that the creature is harmless 
 They become friends , and ProtagonistA visits the deep every day to swim and play with ProtagonistA's new friend 
 ProtagonistB was sitting in a grand throne , wearing a beautiful dress and a crown 
 ProtagonistB listened sympathetically and then said ,  ProtagonistB will help ProtagonistA find ProtagonistA's way home , but first ProtagonistA must help ProtagonistB with something 
 ProtagonistB explained that ProtagonistB was very lonely and had no one to talk to 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to stay with ProtagonistB and keep ProtagonistB's company 
 ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA the way out of the castle and back to the forest 
 ProtagonistA was about to give birth to the son of God and ProtagonistA knew that with this great responsibility came great expectations 
 The doctors have been running a lot of tests , but they have n't been able to find anything wrong with ProtagonistA 
 Suddenly , the door to ProtagonistA's room opens and ProtagonistB walks in 
 ProtagonistB has a serious look on ProtagonistB's face 
 ProtagonistA's heart sinks 
 ProtagonistB tells ProtagonistA that the cancer is aggressive and that ProtagonistA will need to start treatment right away 
 Everything in ProtagonistA's life was going perfectly and ProtagonistA could n't have been happier 
 Until one day , out of the blue , ProtagonistB broke up with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB needed some time to figure things out and that ProtagonistB was n't ready for marriage 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistB had been such a big part of ProtagonistA's life 
 What more could ProtagonistA ask ProtagonistA was grateful for all ProtagonistA's blessings , and ProtagonistA tried to make the most of each day 
It was a beautiful good day in October when ProtagonistA trod into the garden and saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was sitting on a bench , reading a book 
 ProtagonistB looked up when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA and smiled 
 Hello , ProtagonistA 
 What a lovely day it is 
 Yes , it is ,  ProtagonistA agreed , sitting down next to ProtagonistB 
  What are ProtagonistB reading?Pride and Prejudice 
 It 's one of ProtagonistB's favorites 
 You should 
 It 's a classic 
  ProtagonistB closed the book and set it aside 
  So , what brings ProtagonistA to the garden?I needed some fresh air 
 It 's been stuffy inside lately 
 I know what ProtagonistA mean 
 I 've been spending more time outside , myself 
 It 's so peaceful here 
 ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA sat in companionable silence for a while , enjoying the beauty of the day 
 I should go 
 I have some things to do 
 All right 
 ProtagonistB 'll see ProtagonistA later 
 Bye , ProtagonistB 
 It was nice to spend some time with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was sentenced to life in prison for a crime ProtagonistA did n't commit 
 ProtagonistA talks to it every night , telling it about ProtagonistA's day and what ProtagonistA hopes to do in the future 
 Suddenly , a shooting star streaks across the sky , and ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA's wish is going to come true 
 The moon is even more beautiful than ProtagonistA could have imagined , and ProtagonistA is soon lost in its enchanting light 
In the year 1853 , the week under which my brother , Mr
 John , was born , ProtagonistA was induced to put a lock of his hair on his head ; and , while the ambassador but little doubted that ProtagonistA was well acted , yet ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA plainly and unmistakably perceived to be interested in the matter , which , however , ProtagonistA had never before encountered in ProtagonistA's life , and which ProtagonistA had never dreamed of any way , before that time , having , in fact no conception of the end or purpose of the conduct of ProtagonistA's affairs , been deceived into believing that they were spent , or that they were in proper hands 
 So , when ProtagonistA heard about the ' oldest work of art of all the earth ' , ProtagonistA was intrigued 
 The inscription said ' Raise the dead with the power of art' 
 Suddenly , the ground began to shake and a skeleton emerged from the ground 
At the turn of the last century , when Europe was drifting apart , there lived ProtagonistA , and by the name of Caroline Caroline , or Caroline of Mary , ProtagonistA was called 
 ProtagonistA was born in England in 1887 to an aristocratic family , but ProtagonistA's parents died when ProtagonistA was young and ProtagonistA was sent to live with ProtagonistA's grandparents in France 
 But the marriage was not a happy one and after a few years they divorced 
 ProtagonistA's stories were very popular and ProtagonistA became a well - known writer 
 But despite ProtagonistA's success , ProtagonistA's life was not a happy one 
 The only reason ProtagonistA had never gone to college was that ProtagonistA did n't want to be thought of as dumb 
 But when ProtagonistA's mom died unexpectedly , ProtagonistA was left with no choice but to take over the diner 
 The only way to save the diner was to get a business degree 
 It was all so overwhelming 
There is no such thing as ProtagonistA , but there is a pricetag which is often a price - tag of the costume which ProtagonistA wears 
 We see ProtagonistA as a symbol of hope , a reminder that there is still magic and beauty in the world 
 The person on the platform spoke to ProtagonistA in a language ProtagonistA did n't understand , but ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could understand it 
 The person spoke to ProtagonistA again , and this time ProtagonistA understood what they were saying 
 They were telling ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB , and how ProtagonistA could get there if ProtagonistA wanted to 
 ProtagonistA was intrigued by ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA asked the person how ProtagonistA could get there 
 They told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA would need to find a door that would take ProtagonistA there 
 It was the door to ProtagonistB 
 It was ProtagonistA's escape from the reality of ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA cherished it 
The sun was up on this day ; the moon was bright and ProtagonistA sprang out of ProtagonistA's perch with a great voice 
 ProtagonistA bounded around the forest , greeting all of ProtagonistA's animal friends along the way 
  Let 's go explore !  
 It hesitated for a moment , but then ran towards ProtagonistA and climbed up ProtagonistA's arm 
Figa , of a family of only two children , having fallen sick , with an acute hope of death , accompanied by great apprehensions , while ProtagonistA was awaiting the publication of ProtagonistA's work , which was entitled A History of the World , ProtagonistA determined to devote to the study of it all that was worthy of ProtagonistA's mind and to the satisfaction of the human race 
ProtagonistA sulks and sinks back into the bible , ProtagonistA's silver eyes fixed on a section regarding birds 
 ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by birds , even before ProtagonistA could read 
 Angry at the birds , for being so free 
 Angry at ProtagonistA , for being so trapped 
  ProtagonistA ,  the voice said ,  ProtagonistA are not alone 
 We are all here with ProtagonistA 
 They were all different kinds , but they were all singing the same song 
 The painting is of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB's hair cascading down ProtagonistB's back in a waterfall of curls 
 ProtagonistB's eyes are closed , ProtagonistB's face turned up to the sky 
I see ProtagonistA's Rolls - Royce parked beside my school , said ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA's fancy - picture - tiles on the mantelpiece , and ProtagonistA's clapboard in the corner 
 One day , ProtagonistB had had enough 
 ProtagonistB sat ProtagonistA down and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to shape up or ProtagonistB was going to cut ProtagonistA off 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB had had enough and ProtagonistB did cut ProtagonistA off 
 ProtagonistA was left with nothing 
 ProtagonistA was forced to get a job and support ProtagonistA 
 It was a hard lesson to learn , but ProtagonistA eventually did 
 ProtagonistA was partial drowned when ProtagonistA climbed into the water to get away from a fire that had broken out on board 
 When ProtagonistA was rescued , ProtagonistA was taken to the hospital and treated for ProtagonistA's injuries 
 ProtagonistA was released from the hospital a few days later and returned to the ship 
 The bird looked at ProtagonistA with its bright , orange eyes and then flew away 
 ProtagonistA was so startled that ProtagonistA dropped ProtagonistA's lamp and it shattered on the floor 
ProtagonistA's facial features , ProtagonistA's eye color , and ProtagonistA's body , said ProtagonistB , are all different 
 ProtagonistB was always pointing out how ProtagonistA was different from the rest of us , and it was n't just ProtagonistA's looks 
 One time , ProtagonistA even found a four - leaf clover ! ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA was special , and that we should all learn from ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB's sword arm was getting tired , and ProtagonistB's guard was slipping 
 ProtagonistB's sword went flying off the edge of the platform they were fighting on , and ProtagonistB stumbled backwards , clutching at ProtagonistB's chest 
 ProtagonistA's cloak flew up into the air and wrapped around ProtagonistB's body , preventing ProtagonistB from falling off the edge 
  ProtagonistA fight well ,  ProtagonistB said 
  With that , ProtagonistB turned and ran back the way they had come , disappearing into the darkness 
 ProtagonistB's face lit up when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had made the right decision 
 When ProtagonistA asked where they were going , ProtagonistB simply told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would see when they got there 
 ProtagonistA was terrified 
 When they arrived at their destination , ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA into a dark room 
 I met ProtagonistB and I married ProtagonistB 
 It sounded like someone was coming up the stairs 
 ProtagonistB was carrying a large bag 
 ProtagonistA did n't want ProtagonistB to know ProtagonistA was there 
 ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistA was relieved that ProtagonistB was gone 
 On the bush was a turnip , and on the turnip was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA and said ,  Hello 
 ProtagonistB's name is Timmy 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life and how ProtagonistB came to be on the turnip 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated by ProtagonistB's story and found ProtagonistA liking ProtagonistB 
 It was early morning , and the sun was just starting to peek over the horizon 
 The birds were chirping and the breeze was blowing 
ProtagonistA had a habit of making a speech with all the amazing clarity , propriety , and rationalism of a genius , and almost the same effect , when ProtagonistA had finished , as when ProtagonistA had finished ; for ProtagonistA was always going on about something , ever since ProtagonistA had heard it described to ProtagonistA 
 This made ProtagonistA quite popular with the other girls , who would often ask ProtagonistA to make a speech at their parties 
 ProtagonistA 's never been one for traditional gender roles and has always been determined to forge ProtagonistA's own path in life 
 So , when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was immediately drawn to ProtagonistB's free - spirited nature and independent streak 
 They were married within a year and ProtagonistA could n't have been happier 
 However , ProtagonistA soon realized that being married was n't quite as freeing as ProtagonistA had thought it would be 
 And , ProtagonistA realized , that was worth more than anything 
They were sitting together on the leaden plank of the old boat , the aye , but not so long ago when the sailors were shivering in their hundreds , when the water was so deep that even the redskin boys were drowned in it ; when the sun was so low and the sky so black that the fires of the desert were almost out of breath , when the ship was so light that ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head in despair when ProtagonistA saw the captain in the middle of the night going beyond the windward deck , and instead of sinking , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA among the stars , drifting in space , with the power to move anything that ProtagonistA pleased in the universe 
 As the lights dim and the film starts to play , ProtagonistA is transported into a whole new world 
 ProtagonistA 's completely captivated by the story unfolding on the screen 
 ProtagonistA 's never experienced anything like it before 
 When the credits start to roll , ProtagonistA is left feeling amazed 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA arrived in San Diego , ProtagonistA was greeted by a large crowd of people 
 The others were ProtagonistA's only hope 
 They were the only ones who could help ProtagonistA 
 They were the only ones who could save ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA ran towards it , hope swelling in ProtagonistA's chest 
 Maybe this was where the others were 
 Maybe this was ProtagonistA's salvation 
 Suddenly , the door of the cabin opened and ProtagonistB stepped out 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with pity and said ,  Come in , ProtagonistA 
 They were tired and dirty , but they were alive 
 They had made it 
 They were safe 
In the beginning was a star , the same star which , in the beginning , ProtagonistA made , the shell of which ProtagonistA fashioned into four parts , the golden - headed , the blue - eyed , the bright - eyed , the yellow - eyed , and the red - eyed 
 The blue - eyed part was for the sky , the bright - eyed part was for the sun , the yellow - eyed part was for the moon , and the red - eyed part was for the stars 
The day that ProtagonistA felt the sudden signs of age , ProtagonistA was called to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was getting old and that ProtagonistA needed to start taking care of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to start exercising and to eat a healthy diet 
 ProtagonistB also told ProtagonistA to start taking a vitamin supplement 
 ProtagonistA's subjects lived in fear of ProtagonistA , and no one dared to disobey ProtagonistA 
 One day , however , ProtagonistB decided ProtagonistB had had enough of living in fear , and ProtagonistB challenged ProtagonistA to a duel 
 To everyone 's surprise , ProtagonistB won , and ProtagonistA was forced to flee ProtagonistA's kingdom 
 ProtagonistA has never been seen since , and ProtagonistA's kingdom is now ruled by ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA heard about the way to hell , ProtagonistA was intrigued 
 It was a dark and dreary place , and ProtagonistA was immediately regretting ProtagonistA's decision to come here 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's world , and about the people who lived in it 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about the suffering and the misery , and ProtagonistA was horrified 
 But ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could n't leave , and that ProtagonistA was stuck in hell for eternity 
 But it was too late , and ProtagonistA was stuck in hell for the rest of ProtagonistA's days 
 However , ProtagonistA's sources were suddenly cut off and ProtagonistA was left with no choice but to go it alone 
 Thanks to ProtagonistA , the people who were responsible for the calamity were brought to justice 
 ProtagonistA 's seen some things in ProtagonistA's time , some things that would make even the most hardened criminal cringe , but ProtagonistA 's never let it get to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 's always been the one to keep ProtagonistA's head in a crisis , and that 's why ProtagonistA 's the best 
 But lately , something 's been bothering ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 's been seeing things out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye , things that disappear when ProtagonistA turns to look at them 
 ProtagonistA 's heard strange noises in the night , and ProtagonistA 's sure that ProtagonistA 's being followed 
 ProtagonistA 's tried to tell ProtagonistA's superiors about ProtagonistA's concerns , but they just brush ProtagonistA off 
 They tell ProtagonistA ProtagonistA 's imagining things , that ProtagonistA 's just working too hard 
 It 's called  the stuff ,  and it 's said to be incredibly powerful 
 People who take it are said to see things that are n't really there , and ProtagonistA is sure that 's what 's happening to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 's saved countless lives by taking this drug off the streets , and ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA 's made a difference 
 ProtagonistB , told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was also born a tall , pretty girl 
 But unlike ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB had never felt like ProtagonistB belonged either 
 The two girls became fast friends and promised to always stick together 
 It was the strangest thing ProtagonistA had ever seen 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was born with a condition that made ProtagonistB look like a boy , but ProtagonistB was really a girl 
 ProtagonistB said that it was hard for ProtagonistB to find love and acceptance because of the way ProtagonistB looked 
 But ProtagonistB was happy with who ProtagonistB was 
 ProtagonistA was so moved by ProtagonistB's story that ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB a hug 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 They had been together for two years and were planning on getting married in the summer 
 Everything was perfect until ProtagonistB was diagnosed with cancer 
 The doctors said that ProtagonistB only had a few months to live 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 They had been planning their future together and now it was all being taken away from ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was sorry for everything and that ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA 
 Then ProtagonistB said goodbye and walked away 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
 It was like a miracle 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , it felt like , in search of a safe place to rest 
 But now , ProtagonistA's luck had run out 
 ProtagonistA had been caught by a group of zombies 
 ProtagonistA was battered and bruised , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was n't going to make it out alive 
 They were all enjoying the warm weather and the longer days 
 ProtagonistB started to tell a story about a time when ProtagonistB was a young boy 
 ProtagonistB said that on the first day of the summer solstice , in the most northeasterly part of the state of Maine , in the summer of 1763 , ProtagonistB had happened to be sitting at the same table as the conversation below took place 
  ProtagonistB was sitting at the table with ProtagonistB's family on the first day of the summer solstice ,  ProtagonistB began 
  It was a beautiful day and we were all enjoying the warm weather 
 Suddenly , a man came running into the village , shouting that the British were coming 
 We all ran to the fort to defend our homes 
 The British arrived and started to attack the fort 
 We fought back as best we could , but we were outnumbered and outgunned 
 After a few hours , the British started to retreat 
 We were all relieved and happy to be alive 
 We had won the battle , but it was a close call 
 ProtagonistB finished ProtagonistB's story and everyone at the table was silent 
 They were all thinking about the brave men and women who had fought and died to defend their homes 
 ProtagonistB had been one of the lucky ones 
 ProtagonistB had survived the battle , but many others had not 
 The summer solstice was a day to remember the past and to celebrate the present 
 It was one of the things ProtagonistA looked forward to most 
 It was a beautiful black cat with green eyes 
 The cat looked at ProtagonistA and meowed 
 It sounded like it was asking for help 
 ProtagonistA's favorite pastime was watching television , and ProtagonistA would often spend hours glued to the screen 
 One day , ProtagonistA's family came to visit ProtagonistA 
 They had been worried about ProtagonistA since ProtagonistA had become more withdrawn and isolated in recent years 
 When they arrived at ProtagonistA's apartment , they found ProtagonistA in a little room on the second floor , laying with ProtagonistA's eyes fixed upon a television screen 
 ProtagonistA's hands were resting upon the table , and ProtagonistA seemed to be in a trance - like state 
 ProtagonistA's family tried to talk to ProtagonistA and get ProtagonistA to respond , but it was as if ProtagonistA could n't hear them 
 They eventually had to leave ProtagonistA there , alone in ProtagonistA's little room , staring at the television 
 It sounded like ProtagonistA's mother 
 The rabbit was wearing a waistcoat and a pocket watch 
  ProtagonistA , I 'm late , late , late !  The rabbit said in a frantic voice 
 The rabbit led ProtagonistA to a large door 
  Through here , ProtagonistA !  The rabbit said 
 The first thing ProtagonistA noticed was the giant mushrooms 
 The rabbit led ProtagonistA to a small house 
  This is my home ,  the rabbit said 
 But when ProtagonistA would begin the long , slow process of relocating from one place to another , the Living would always find a way to beat ProtagonistA to it 
 They would show up at ProtagonistA's new house before ProtagonistA could even get there , and they would always be one step ahead of ProtagonistA 
 It was as if they knew ProtagonistA every move 
 It was a name that held much power and influence in the court of King Louis XIV 
 And that was how ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA at the château of the Riveuilles 
 They were all wondering who ProtagonistA was and why ProtagonistA was there 
 The party was in full swing by the time ProtagonistA arrived 
 ProtagonistA was soon swept up in the festivities 
 The music was loud , the champagne was flowing , and everyone was dancing 
 They danced together and laughed together and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream 
 But all good things must come to an end 
 Eventually , the party started to wind down and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA saying goodbye to ProtagonistB 
 After all , it was the Saturday before the fourth Sunday in May
 The sun was already high in the sky by the time ProtagonistA finally opened ProtagonistA's eyes , and ProtagonistA cursed ProtagonistA for sleeping in so late 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and quickly got dressed , then headed downstairs 
 ProtagonistB was in the kitchen , and ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a stern look 
  ProtagonistA 're up late ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB sighed 
  ProtagonistB hope so ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Now go outside and play 
 It 's a beautiful day 
 The beauty of the Heavenly City had astounded ProtagonistA , and the streets were lined with the most perfect of pearls 
 ProtagonistC had been so pleased with ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC had given ProtagonistA a gift ; a golden crown , set with diamonds and rubies 
 The river was swollen and fast - flowing , and ProtagonistA could see that the path ahead was washed away 
 Suddenly , the ground gave way beneath ProtagonistA's feet and ProtagonistA was pulled into the river 
 ProtagonistA fought against the current , but eventually ProtagonistA tired and ProtagonistA's body went limp 
 The only thing ProtagonistA could think to do was to walk and clear ProtagonistA's head 
 They were laughing and joking and seemed to be having the time of their lives 
 Elizabeth , the wife of Mr
 Eliopolo , the Colonel of the Household at Court , and with whom ProtagonistA was always merry , and who was the cause of much expense to Carol 's owing to the imprudence of ProtagonistA , for ProtagonistA had never thought of it before 
 They all greeted ProtagonistA with great joy , and ProtagonistA was soon seated at the table , where ProtagonistA found that a sumptuous repast had been prepared for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was armed with the knowledge of ProtagonistA's enemies ' weaknesses , and ProtagonistA was confident in ProtagonistA's own abilities 
In the year 1251 ProtagonistA loomed over London , and what was the matter with ProtagonistA ? No one could say for sure , but some speculated that ProtagonistA was a giantess come to destroy the city 
 Others said that ProtagonistA was a benevolent spirit come to protect them from harm 
 Whatever the case may have been , everyone was afraid of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB ordered ProtagonistB's best knights to go and investigate ProtagonistA , but they were all afraid to approach ProtagonistA 
 Finally , ProtagonistB went to speak with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was so grateful to ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB ordered a statue to be built in ProtagonistA's honor 
 It stands to this day in the center of London , a reminder of ProtagonistA 
It was whispered in the city that ProtagonistA knew how it came to pass 
 ProtagonistA's victims were always men , and ProtagonistA always made sure to torture them before killing them 
 The servant of the lord Bishop of York , who had been appointed by the king to receive the precepts of the church , had been instructed to deliver it to ProtagonistA 
After the war ended , a little more than a year earlier , we settled in a house in the district of St
 Peter 's , in which ProtagonistA had done the best ProtagonistA could 
 It was a small house , but it was cozy and we were happy there 
 We had been through so much together , and now we were finally able to start our lives anew 
 Now , ProtagonistA was determined to make a new life for ProtagonistA and for us 
 We settled into our new life quickly 
 We were both busy , but we were happy 
 We had each other , and that was all that mattered 
 Life was good for a while 
 At first , we thought it was just a cold , but it quickly became clear that it was something more serious 
 ProtagonistA was diagnosed with cancer , and our world was turned upside down 
 We fought hard , but in the end , ProtagonistA lost ProtagonistA's battle 
 ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's family and friends and how they had all helped ProtagonistA along the way 
  ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA okay ?  The voice belonged to ProtagonistA's friend , Concerned 
ProtagonistA can remember the last time ProtagonistA had sex like it was yesterday 
 Unfortunately , all good things must come to an end , and ProtagonistA's boyfriend died shortly after they finished 
 ProtagonistA was called the Angel of Death because ProtagonistA had the audacity to become the Victim of a horrible and terrible crime 
 The crime was the least of all crimes , but it was still a crime 
 The man was never caught and ProtagonistA's death left the world in shock 
 The grass was overgrown , the walkways were cracked and uneven , and the whole place looked like it had been neglected 
ProtagonistA's office was always bustling with activity 
 Today was no different as a dozen men came in , all well - dressed and looking important 
 ProtagonistA knew why they were here - they were here to talk about the city 's improved condition and how it was affecting their businesses 
 The men were taken aback by ProtagonistA's forthrightness but they could see the wisdom in ProtagonistA's words 
 They agreed to help ProtagonistA and , before long , ProtagonistA's business was booming 
 All thanks to the dozen men who came to ProtagonistA's office that day 
You ca n't be the father of ProtagonistA 
 You just ca n't be 
 There 's no way 
 I mean , you and ProtagonistA's mother were never even together 
 You do n't even have the same last name 
 Plus , you 're black and ProtagonistA 's white 
 There 's just no way you could be the father of ProtagonistA 
 But here you are , standing in front of the judge , with the DNA test results in your hand , proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that you are in fact the father of ProtagonistA 
 The look on ProtagonistA's mother 's face is one of pure shock , and ProtagonistA is just staring at you with a mix of confusion and hurt in ProtagonistA's eyes 
 You ca n't help but feel guilty 
 You know that you should have told ProtagonistA the truth a long time ago , but you were afraid of how ProtagonistA would react 
 You were afraid of losing ProtagonistA 
 But now it 's too late 
 The damage is done 
 You can see the pain in ProtagonistA's eyes , and you know that you 've caused it 
 You wish you could take it all back , but you ca n't 
 All you can do is try to make things right from here on out 
 It was a small , black cat 
 The cat was meowing and looked up at ProtagonistA with its big , green eyes 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA was lost 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to come sit with ProtagonistB for a while 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA 
 They talked until the sun came up 
 When it was time to go , ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a hug and told ProtagonistA to come back anytime 
I have been listening to the last of the bishoprics and continuing to write to ProtagonistA , to inform ProtagonistA of my intention of moving to Canterbury - upon - Avon 
 I have been entranced by the beauty of the countryside and the peace that seems to pervade the air 
 I know that ProtagonistA will miss me , but I hope that ProtagonistA will understand my need for this change 
 I have already put my affairs in order and am ready to make the move 
 I only hope that ProtagonistA will be able to visit me often 
 ProtagonistA was determined not to let the other girls get the better of ProtagonistA 
 They were all very friendly and told ProtagonistA about their lives 
 They told ProtagonistA about their families , their jobs , and their hobbies 
 However , there was one dream that ProtagonistA never dared to dream 
 It was the great dream , the thing ProtagonistA should never have taken the risk of doing 
 The wish , that great wish , that frightful wish , that terrible wish 
 That was something ProtagonistA never would have done , if ProtagonistA had not met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB's name was Tim , and ProtagonistB was always asking ProtagonistA questions about ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistB wanted to know everything about ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA telling ProtagonistB things ProtagonistA had never told anyone before 
 The wish , that great wish , that frightful wish , that terrible wish 
 At first , ProtagonistB was shocked 
 ProtagonistB could n't believe that ProtagonistA would even consider doing something so risky 
 But then ProtagonistB started to think about it , and ProtagonistB realized that it was the perfect solution to all of ProtagonistA's problems 
 And it was everything ProtagonistA had ever hoped for 
 The hand grabbed ProtagonistA and pulled ProtagonistA under the water 
 ProtagonistA even met a talking rabbit ! ProtagonistB was a very magical place and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA's eyes were aflame with curiosity as ProtagonistA listened to the news 
One day , as ProtagonistA stood in the garden of ProtagonistA's father 's house , tracing the outlines of the structure ProtagonistA had built there on the foundations of the old stone house , the man who would become known as the Great Scribe of the Old Testament , or , as some people called ProtagonistA , the Habite Cretan , or simply the Lost Scribe , began to write 
 ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA for some time , and ProtagonistB was struck by the look of determination on ProtagonistA's face 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA was not going to give up on ProtagonistA's dream , no matter what 
 ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB to ProtagonistA and they began to talk 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's own life and how ProtagonistB had become the Great Scribe 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about the people ProtagonistB had met and the places ProtagonistB had seen 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about the things ProtagonistB had learned and the wisdom ProtagonistB had gained 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated by ProtagonistB's stories and ProtagonistA hung on ProtagonistB's every word 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB offered to teach ProtagonistA how to write 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled and accepted immediately 
 People started to take notice of the work that ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA were doing together , and soon they were famous 
 People came from all over to hear them speak and to learn from them 
 ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA continued to work together for many years , and they became known as the Great Scribe and ProtagonistA 
 Their work changed the course of history , and their stories continue to inspire people to this day 
 The price was unbeatable , but the shipping costs were a bit high 
 ProtagonistB , was very unhelpful 
 ProtagonistB refused to budge on the shipping costs and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was lucky to get the television at that price 
 ProtagonistA was getting frustrated and was about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a voice in the back of ProtagonistA's mind 
 It was ProtagonistA's grandmother 's voice , telling ProtagonistA to never give up 
 This time , ProtagonistB relented and offered to ship the television to ProtagonistA for free 
The gods had finally worked out that , if ProtagonistA were to find a way to put an end to the anarchy that had swept the earth in the course of the last three thousand years , ProtagonistA would have to take refuge in a city of indeterminate size and location 
 They knew that this city would be ProtagonistA's only hope , and so they did everything in their power to help ProtagonistA find it 
 The city was hidden away in a remote corner of the world , and it was guarded by a powerful magic 
 But ProtagonistA was not deterred 
I remember as a child very well what it was like to grow up in a house with ProtagonistA , and the duty of having trouble with ProtagonistA 
 But it was never easy 
 But despite all of ProtagonistA's mischievous antics , I always loved ProtagonistA 
 And I know that ProtagonistA loved me too , even if ProtagonistA never said it 
 The sun had barely peeked over the horizon , but ProtagonistA had been up for hours 
 It was a hard life , but it was the only life ProtagonistA knew 
 The old one had fallen into disrepair and was no longer fit for ProtagonistA's chickens 
 They deserved the best , and ProtagonistA was determined to give it to them 
 By lunchtime , ProtagonistA was exhausted , but the new coop was finished 
 It was a beautiful sight 
 It had been a long day , but it was a good day 
 I knew that ProtagonistA was special , and I was so lucky to have met ProtagonistA 
 I knew that ProtagonistA would always be there for me , no matter what 
 I will never forget the day that ProtagonistA died 
 I was so devastated 
 I could not believe that ProtagonistA was gone 
 I felt like I had lost a part of myself 
 I will never forget ProtagonistA , and I will always cherish our friendship 
 However , ProtagonistA was forced to retire when ProtagonistA's health began to fail 
 ProtagonistB had forgotten ProtagonistB's name , ProtagonistB's family , and even ProtagonistB's own face 
 But ProtagonistB remembered ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB remembered ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB would do anything for ProtagonistA , even if it meant sacrificing ProtagonistB's own life 
 ProtagonistA was shocked and tried to explain that ProtagonistA did n't have that kind of money , but ProtagonistB was insistent 
 ProtagonistB said that if ProtagonistA did n't pay ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB would make ProtagonistA's life a living hell 
 It would take ProtagonistA a few weeks , but ProtagonistA was determined to do it 
 ProtagonistA would not be blackmailed 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA was interrupted by a loud noise outside 
 It sounded like cannon fire 
 They were followed by a second group , this one in Confederate gray 
 The two groups were exchanging gunfire , and ProtagonistA quickly ducked back down , out of the line of fire 
 After a few minutes , it was all over , and ProtagonistA cautiously peeked out the window again 
 The street was littered with bodies , both Union and Confederate , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's stomach turn 
 It was the first time I saw ProtagonistA and I was instantly drawn to ProtagonistA 
 I wanted to be like ProtagonistA 
 I wanted to be happy and free like ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA was my inspiration and I will never forget ProtagonistA 
 The rabbit beckoned ProtagonistA to follow , and so ProtagonistA did 
 The rabbit led ProtagonistA to a large door in a tree , which opened into a beautiful garden 
 It ran as follows :  ProtagonistB , is hereby empowered to demand and receive from my subjects whatsoever sums of money ProtagonistB may think fit , for the purpose of carrying on the war against the rebels in America 
 Given under my hand and seal at this , my palace of Westminster , this day of in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy - six 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled and could n't wait to tell ProtagonistA's friends and family 
 ProtagonistA dreamed of a world where ProtagonistA could be anything ProtagonistA wanted to be 
 It was a wonderful dream , and ProtagonistA never forgot it 
 ProtagonistA wonders if ProtagonistA is invisible 
 It was their daily routine to meet at the park and walk around together 
 But today , ProtagonistB was late 
  ProtagonistB 'm sorry ProtagonistB 'm late ,  ProtagonistB said breathlessly 
  ProtagonistB had to help ProtagonistB's mom with something 
  The two friends began walking and chatting as they always did 
 But today , something felt different 
 It was as if the air between them was charged with electricity 
 They both felt it , but neither said anything 
 They just walked a little closer together , their hands brushing occasionally 
 Eventually , they reached the edge of the park and said goodbye 
 But this time , instead of going their separate ways , they turned to each other and kissed 
 It was as if they had been waiting for this moment all their lives 
It was not long before ProtagonistA felt she mentioned in whispers of name and nationality 
 It did n't bother ProtagonistA too much at first , but eventually , ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA was the only one who did n't know all the town 's secrets 
 ProtagonistB looked surprised and then explained that ProtagonistA was the only new person in town and that people were just curious about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was relieved to hear this and thanked ProtagonistB for being honest with ProtagonistA 
 But the closer ProtagonistA got , the further away ProtagonistB seemed to be 
 ProtagonistA was lost in this place with no idea how to get out 
 They were all so happy for ProtagonistA 
 The deathbringer lay before ProtagonistA , whimpering and begging for mercy , but ProtagonistA would have none of it 
 ProtagonistA's eyes were so full of life and love that I knew ProtagonistA was going to be okay 
ProtagonistB had ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA was five years old , ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a name 
 ProtagonistB named ProtagonistA after ProtagonistA's mother 
 It was only when ProtagonistA felt a cold hand on ProtagonistA's shoulder that ProtagonistA looked up 
 It is like nothing ProtagonistA can imagine , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB replied 
  But ProtagonistB can show ProtagonistA 
 And with that , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA's hand and led ProtagonistA out of the study and into the night 
 It was a beautiful day , the sun was shining and the birds were singing 
 Samuel Church of the City College of that city caressed ProtagonistA's nose and said , with a smile over his mouth ,  I do n't suppose she've ever heard of the Luke the ProtagonistA was indeed quite surprised to hear of ProtagonistB , and Mr
 Church proceeded to tell ProtagonistA all about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB , it seemed , was a very famous man who had lived many years ago and had done many great things 
 ProtagonistB had been a great warrior and had conquered many lands 
 ProtagonistB had also been a great thinker and had written many books 
 Church if ProtagonistA could meet ProtagonistB 
 Church told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could , and the two of them set off on a journey to find ProtagonistB 
 After many days of travel , they finally arrived at a small village where ProtagonistB was said to live 
 They went to ProtagonistB's house and knocked on the door 
 A small boy answered and said that ProtagonistB was not home 
 Alice and Mr
 Church were about to leave when they heard a voice from inside the house 
 It was ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistB had been hiding and listening to them the whole time 
 ProtagonistB came out and spoke to them , and ProtagonistA was immediately struck by ProtagonistB's wisdom and kindness 
 This made ProtagonistA's life very difficult , but ProtagonistA never gave up 
 ProtagonistA never left England , thank heaven 
  ProtagonistA's friends were shocked 
 They asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA had never left England 
 It was always so beautiful and peaceful 
 It would be like being in a different world 
 One day , ProtagonistA's dream came true 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA's fingers and toes started to feel numb from the cold 
 Unfortunately , ProtagonistA's mom called ProtagonistA inside and ProtagonistA had to leave ProtagonistA's winter wonderland behind 
 ProtagonistA's passengers were screaming in terror , begging ProtagonistA to stop 
 Miraculously , everyone survived , but ProtagonistA was taken away in a straitjacket , never to be seen again 
There was once ProtagonistA , and at the age of eleven ProtagonistA could see the future 
 ProtagonistB was always alone , and ProtagonistB never spoke to anyone 
 ProtagonistB would just sit in the corner of the room , staring at everyone with ProtagonistB's piercing eyes 
 ProtagonistB just stared at ProtagonistA for a moment , and then ProtagonistB spoke 
I'm not alone ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB have the company of the demons ProtagonistA was scared by ProtagonistB's words , and ProtagonistA ran away from ProtagonistB 
They decided to take ProtagonistB to see a priest , who would help ProtagonistB get rid of the demons 
The priest spoke to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what was wrong 
 ProtagonistB told the priest about the demons that ProtagonistB saw , and the priest was very shocked 
The priest told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB was not possessed by any demons , and that ProtagonistB was just seeing things that were n't really there 
The priest helped ProtagonistB to get rid of ProtagonistB's fear of the demons , and ProtagonistB was finally able to live a normal life 
ProtagonistB was the last man ProtagonistA saw before ProtagonistA died 
 ProtagonistB was a forgotten white - bearded beauty of the East India ocean 
 ProtagonistB was the only other inhabitant of the island 
 ProtagonistB was a devilish looking man , with a long white beard and piercing black eyes 
 ProtagonistB lived in a small hut on the beach 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA and said ,  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm going to kill ProtagonistA 
 It 's the devil 's day , and ProtagonistB ai n't gon na let ProtagonistA live 
 ProtagonistB strangled ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's hands and then drowned ProtagonistA in the ocean 
ProtagonistA's godfather took ProtagonistA to see Mummy , Mummy 's sweetheart , Mummy 's sister , Mummy 
 They all had a lovely time together and it was great for ProtagonistA to finally meet ProtagonistA's extended family 
There was once ProtagonistA 
There was once , and there will always be one , Doctor LeDeux , a man who said ProtagonistA was going to be a god and that ProtagonistA was going to take over the universe and rule it and make the best of it 
 ProtagonistB was a madman , of course , but ProtagonistA did n't know that 
 The City of Gold was everything ProtagonistB had promised it would be , and more 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistB reappeared 
 ProtagonistB was old and frail , but ProtagonistB's eyes still burned with madness 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had to leave the City of Gold and come with ProtagonistB , or else ProtagonistB would destroy it 
 I was struck by ProtagonistA's beauty , but also by the sadness in ProtagonistA's eyes 
 It was as if ProtagonistA was looking for something that ProtagonistA could never find 
 We became friends quickly , and I soon learned that ProtagonistA was searching for ProtagonistA's purpose in life 
 One day , I took ProtagonistA on a hike to a hidden waterfall 
 ProtagonistB was a cruel king , and ProtagonistB demanded that everyone in the kingdom bow down to ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistC was not going to let ProtagonistB get away with it 
 ProtagonistC haunted ProtagonistB day and night , making ProtagonistB's life a living nightmare 
 Finally , ProtagonistC drove ProtagonistB insane and ProtagonistB took ProtagonistB's own life 
 ProtagonistA was always impeccably dressed in the latest fashions and carried ProtagonistA with the air of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's features were sharp and angular , ProtagonistA's eyes piercing and ProtagonistA's mouth always seemed to be curved in a slight smirk 
 ProtagonistA was used to getting ProtagonistA's own way and ProtagonistA liked it that way 
 But there was one thing that ProtagonistA wanted that ProtagonistA could never quite seem to get ProtagonistA's hands on : love 
 But none of them had ever been able to penetrate ProtagonistA's cold exterior 
 ProtagonistC was kind and gentle and ProtagonistC seemed to see right through ProtagonistA's carefully constructed facade 
 And it was the best feeling in the world 
 ProtagonistB was very handsome and had a kind face 
 They talked for a while and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA telling ProtagonistB all about ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistB listened patiently and then told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life on Mount Olympus and all the different gods and goddesses ProtagonistB knew 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated and asked ProtagonistB many questions 
 Eventually , they said goodbye and ProtagonistA woke up 
 But there was one thing that nobody knew about ProtagonistA , and that was that ProtagonistA had a power 
 It was a secret that ProtagonistA had never told anyone , not even ProtagonistA's best friend 
 The dog was yelping and looked terrified , and the boys were laughing 
 Suddenly , the boys stopped laughing 
 They looked confused and scared , and they started to yelp just like the dog had been doing 
 The dog took advantage of the situation and ran away , and the boys were left confused and scared 
 de la Tourgave , staring at ProtagonistA from the shelf 
 It was as if they were trying to tell ProtagonistA something 
 ProtagonistA was intrigued , and decided to read them 
 The characters came to life for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could feel their emotions and experiences as if they were ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA was blown away by the power of these works , and knew that ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's true calling 
 From then on , ProtagonistA dedicated ProtagonistA's life to writing 
 ProtagonistA's novels became even more popular , and ProtagonistA was hailed as one of the greatest authors of ProtagonistA's generation 
 ProtagonistA was determined to one day go and hunt the sea ProtagonistA 
 They went out to the deep sea where the fish were 
 But no matter how long ProtagonistA waited , the fish just would n't come 
 ProtagonistA's father told ProtagonistA to be patient and that sometimes the fish just were n't biting 
 They had VIP tickets and were able to meet the band before the show 
 The band was very friendly and even signed autographs for them 
 The show was incredible and they danced and sang along to all of the songs 
 It was an unforgettable experience and they will always cherish the memories of that night 
 It was a place where ProtagonistA could clear ProtagonistA's head and really think 
 The lake was so clear and blue , and the trees were so green 
 It was a beautiful day 
 They were all middle - aged , and they looked like they belonged to the middle class 
 It was a clear and clear day , and ProtagonistA felt at peace 
 ProtagonistA was surrounded by nature , and ProtagonistA felt connected to the earth 
 It was a good day 
 The trip went smoothly and ProtagonistA enjoyed every minute of it 
 It was an experience that ProtagonistA would never forget 
 However , it is said that ProtagonistA grew up to be a very rich man 
 ProtagonistB had come to take ProtagonistA back , and ProtagonistA went willingly 
 They had a happy life together , and ProtagonistA often took pride in ProtagonistB's accomplishments 
 However , tragedy struck when ProtagonistB suddenly became ill and died just a few short years after they were married 
 ProtagonistA was devastated by the loss , but ProtagonistA found comfort in knowing that ProtagonistA had made ProtagonistB's life happy while ProtagonistA could 
The feathered birds had listened to an order Alice 'd given ProtagonistA 
 But , they did n't want to leave ProtagonistA 
 They loved ProtagonistA too much 
 So , they decided to stay 
 And , they would always be there for ProtagonistA , no matter what happened 
There was once ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was not called Jerome for nothing - for ProtagonistA was a loner , and a loner was never loved 
As the sun shone in the days that followed the death of the father , Robert Prynne , the death of once and a new father , the death of a sister and the death of a niece , and the marriage of a brother , and the death of a brother - in - law , there came into existence in Ireland of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was brought up by ProtagonistA's uncle and aunt and ProtagonistA had a happy childhood 
 When ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA's uncle died and ProtagonistA's aunt died soon afterwards 
 ProtagonistA was left alone in the world 
 ProtagonistA was kind and good to them and they loved ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB , died 
 The years passed and ProtagonistA grew old 
 One day , ProtagonistC came to see ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistC was now a married woman with children of ProtagonistC's own 
 ProtagonistC was very kind to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC often came to see ProtagonistA 
 The children ProtagonistA had taught were all grown up and they all loved ProtagonistA 
 They often came to see ProtagonistA and they were very kind to ProtagonistA 
 One day , one of them came to see ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was very ill 
 But ProtagonistA was happy in ProtagonistA's death , for ProtagonistA had lived to see the happiness of those ProtagonistA had loved 
 ProtagonistC ran away from ProtagonistA as fast as ProtagonistC could 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 The staircase went on for what seemed like forever , but ProtagonistA was not afraid 
 On the table was a tea set , and in the chair next to it was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was very old and had a kind face 
 ProtagonistB invited ProtagonistA to sit down and have some tea 
ProtagonistA was born into an unforgiving world , a world where ProtagonistA's honour was worth the most trivial of things , such as the way ProtagonistA dressed , or the way ProtagonistA spoke , or how ProtagonistA acted toward women 
 It was clear that ProtagonistB was in pain , and ProtagonistA immediately ran over to help ProtagonistB 
 The men tried to stop ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was determined to help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was extremely grateful , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had made a difference in the world 
ProtagonistA may have put it best at the end of ProtagonistA's last letter :  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ProtagonistA could n't be the person you wanted ProtagonistA to be 
 We had been together for two years , and in that time , ProtagonistA had become the center of my world 
 I loved ProtagonistA with all of my heart , but it was n't enough 
 I thought I would be lost without ProtagonistA , but I 'm slowly finding my way 
 I 'm rebuilding my life , one day at a time 
 And , even though ProtagonistA 's not a part of it , I 'm happy 
 However , there was one thing that ProtagonistA could not do 
 ProtagonistA had been taught that it was ProtagonistA's job to share the gospel with those who were lost , but ProtagonistA could not do that with those who were already saved 
 They told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was wasting ProtagonistA's time 
 ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was trying to share the gospel with ProtagonistA's Christian friends in the same way that ProtagonistA would share it with those who were lost 
 However , ProtagonistA's Christian friends already knew the gospel 
 They did not need ProtagonistA to share it with them 
 The old adage among the missionaries is true 
 The book said that if ProtagonistA possessed ProtagonistB's power , ProtagonistA would be able to control death itself 
 ProtagonistA was intrigued by this idea , and so ProtagonistA set out to find ProtagonistB 
 But instead of taking ProtagonistA's soul , ProtagonistB bowed down to ProtagonistA 
 This would be ProtagonistA's last day on earth 
 Something to remember ProtagonistA by 
 ProtagonistB had always been ProtagonistA's favorite , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would take good care of everything 
 It was ProtagonistA's own reflection , peering back at ProtagonistA from between a pair of awnings 
The last time ProtagonistA was seen alive the blood - mourner thought that ProtagonistA had been already dead for some years 
 The mourner had seen ProtagonistA's body in the ground , and the ground had been cold and hard 
 But when the mourner went to ProtagonistA's grave , the body was gone and the ground was warm 
 The mourner knew that ProtagonistA was alive , and the mourner went to find ProtagonistA 
 The mourner found ProtagonistA in a dark place , and ProtagonistA was scared 
 The mourner comforted ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA told the mourner ProtagonistA's story 
Robert of Moray had been dying of a heart attack for some weeks before ProtagonistA's parents found ProtagonistA , in a pool underneath the stairs , still alive 
 When they pulled ProtagonistA out , ProtagonistA was barely breathing and ProtagonistA's skin was cold to the touch 
 They rushed ProtagonistA to the hospital , where the doctors were able to revive ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's parents were relieved and grateful that ProtagonistA was alive , but they were also haunted by what could have happened 
 They could have lost ProtagonistA forever if they had n't found ProtagonistA when they did 
 They vowed to never let anything like that happen again and to always keep a close eye on ProtagonistA 
The moment ProtagonistA appeared , all eyes in the garden were riveted on ProtagonistA 
 It was as if they had been expecting ProtagonistA 
 It was one of ProtagonistA's favorite dresses , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA looked good in it 
 ProtagonistA had been invited , but ProtagonistA had been hesitant to come 
 They welcomed ProtagonistA warmly , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA enjoying their company 
 The party went on late into the night , and ProtagonistA had a wonderful time 
 ProtagonistB was friendly and chatty during the journey 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA about ProtagonistA's life and told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's work 
 ProtagonistB seemed very intelligent and ProtagonistA was impressed 
 When they arrived at their destination , ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistA to ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was a prefect , a high - ranking member of the government 
 ProtagonistA was disappointed that ProtagonistC was not as interesting as ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC was polite but aloof 
 ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA about ProtagonistA's work but seemed disinterested in ProtagonistA's answers 
 ProtagonistC was more interested in talking to ProtagonistB about politics 
 ProtagonistC was not what ProtagonistA had expected 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was very poor and had no money 
 ProtagonistB was so happy and thanked ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would never forget ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA , confused 
 ProtagonistB did n't understand a word ProtagonistA had said 
 ProtagonistB's face softened in understanding 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 're alive ,  ProtagonistB said ,  and beautiful , even in this month , may ProtagonistA be chosen , so that ProtagonistA may be detained , and may ProtagonistA veil ProtagonistA , and then , and may ProtagonistA have power over tyrants 
ProtagonistA's parents had suspected all along that ProtagonistA had what was known as the infectious mind 
 They had seen the way ProtagonistA would light up a room with ProtagonistA's smile , and the way ProtagonistA would always be the first to start dancing at a party 
 They knew that ProtagonistA was special , and they were right 
 ProtagonistA's parents knew that this was a rare quality , and they were grateful that ProtagonistA had it 
 However , they also knew that the infectious mind could be a double - edged sword 
 This often led to ProtagonistA getting hurt , both emotionally and physically 
 Still , ProtagonistA's parents loved ProtagonistA unconditionally , and they would do anything to protect ProtagonistA 
 They knew that the infectious mind was a part of who ProtagonistA was , and they would never try to change ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was respected by all who knew ProtagonistA and was always looking for ways to improve ProtagonistA 
 The book was about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was inspired by the book and decided to fight for women 's rights 
ProtagonistA's family was one of the original families to settle in Melbourne 
 They were strong and industrious , and had thirty - four children , fourteen of whom were born in Melbourne 
 ProtagonistA's family was successful and ProtagonistA's parents were always busy working 
 However , they always made time for their children and were always there for them 
 ProtagonistB was a young woman , who had been stabbed to death in ProtagonistB's own home 
 The police had no leads and the case was quickly becoming a cold one 
 ProtagonistA was disturbed by the news and decided to take a walk around the city to clear ProtagonistA's head 
 The man stabbed ProtagonistA to death and then fled the scene 
 The police never caught the killer and the case remains unsolved to this day 
 ProtagonistA was feared and respected , and ProtagonistA had a reputation for being a cold - blooded businesswoman 
 But ProtagonistA's thirst for power was not yet quenched 
 ProtagonistA was feared and respected by everyone , and ProtagonistA had a reputation for being a ruthless businesswoman 
 But ProtagonistA's hunger for power was ProtagonistA's downfall 
 One day , ProtagonistA was betrayed by ProtagonistA's closest confidante , and ProtagonistA was murdered 
 ProtagonistA's body was never found , and ProtagonistA's killers were never caught 
 But ProtagonistA's story lives on , and ProtagonistA is remembered as a cold - blooded businesswoman who was ultimately destroyed by ProtagonistA's own greed 
ProtagonistA was not a sailor , for ProtagonistA had sailed south through a sea of ice and snow , and more than once had visited the tundra of Alaska 
 It took ProtagonistA three years , and ProtagonistA visited many different countries and met many different people 
On the afternoon of the last Saturday of the month , February , 1882 , there was born to the father , William Granger , ProtagonistA 
 They named ProtagonistA after ProtagonistA's grandmother , who had passed away a few years earlier 
 On the afternoon of the last Saturday of the month , February , 1882 , ProtagonistA was born 
We were once married , said ProtagonistA , but we were never only married 
 The City was a cold , hard place , and the people there did n't know how to love 
 But the Holy Land was a place of peace and love , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would be happy there 
In the year 1252 , when the eastern wall of Constantinople began to give way , the Spaniard Iberico de Este , who , in spite of the worst hardships ProtagonistA had to endure , as a soldier of fortune , and in spite of the most abject conditions ProtagonistA had met in life , had made another discovery 
 ProtagonistB had found the body of ProtagonistA in the ruins of the city , and ProtagonistA was still alive 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB's camp and nursed ProtagonistA back to health 
 ProtagonistA's name was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's story 
 When the city fell , ProtagonistA's husband was killed , and ProtagonistA was taken prisoner 
 ProtagonistA was sold into slavery , and ProtagonistA had been passed from owner to owner , until ProtagonistA finally ended up in the hands of the Spaniards 
 ProtagonistB was moved by ProtagonistA's story , and ProtagonistB vowed to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB left Constantinople , and ProtagonistB eventually brought ProtagonistA back to England 
 ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA a job in a merchant 's house , and ProtagonistA was able to start a new life 
 ProtagonistA's parents were so proud of ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's love for reading 
 ProtagonistA's feet were sore and ProtagonistA was getting hungry 
 It looked abandoned , but ProtagonistA decided to check it out anyway 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA eventually came across a door marked  Do Not Enter 
ProtagonistA was known for ProtagonistA's sharp tongue 
 ProtagonistA's friends loved ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's honesty , but ProtagonistA's enemies feared ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB's body was spilling out of the dress and it was clear ProtagonistB was uncomfortable 
  It 's not flattering and ProtagonistB look like ProtagonistB 're about to burst out of it 
 The woman 's face turned red with embarrassment 
 ProtagonistB quickly excused ProtagonistB and left the party 
 ProtagonistA's friends laughed and praised ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's honesty 
 ProtagonistB had a long beard and was wearing a red suit 
 ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as the devil 
 They talked for a while and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA telling ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's deepest secrets 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB liked ProtagonistA and wanted to make a deal with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would give ProtagonistA anything ProtagonistA wanted if ProtagonistA agreed to be ProtagonistB's friend 
 ProtagonistB kept ProtagonistB's word and gave ProtagonistA everything ProtagonistA wanted 
 All because ProtagonistA made a deal with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was surrounded by friends , laughing and joking and having a great time 
 Son of a whore ,  said ProtagonistA , as the girl went into the very room where ProtagonistA had the feast 
 ProtagonistA was determined to never speak to that girl again 
ProtagonistA's life changed forever the day ProtagonistA stepped down from the roof of the Lancaster Moor house 
 But they did n't 
 They were both so set on going their separate ways 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 It was too painful 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistB sounded so worried 
 This time ProtagonistB sounded closer 
 And ProtagonistB sounded like ProtagonistB was crying 
 It was the hardest thing ProtagonistA ever had to do , but ProtagonistA knew it was the right thing 
 So , when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB for the first time , ProtagonistA felt drawn to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was different than the other kids too 
 ProtagonistB was always so serious and focused 
 To ProtagonistA's surprise , ProtagonistB was actually quite friendly 
 They began talking and soon became fast friends 
 ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistA belonged somewhere 
 ProtagonistB's parents were getting divorced and ProtagonistB was having a hard time adjusting 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB started to feel better 
 The pain of ProtagonistB's parents ' divorce was still there , but ProtagonistB was healing 
 ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA remained friends and they both cherished their friendship 
 They knew that they had a special bond that would never be broken 
 So , when the rumor started circulating that ProtagonistA had hired a team of assassins to kill ProtagonistB's father , it did n't seem all that far - fetched 
 ProtagonistB was always getting into trouble , and ProtagonistB's father was always putting ProtagonistB down 
 Fortunately , ProtagonistA's plan worked and ProtagonistB's father was killed 
 However , ProtagonistC was sitting in the car with the first degree of the court of coroner 
 ProtagonistC was devastated by what had happened , but ProtagonistC knew that ProtagonistA had only done it to save ProtagonistC's son 
 The angel spoke to ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was destined to be the king of the world 
 ProtagonistA was astonished and asked the angel how this could be 
 The angel explained that ProtagonistA had been chosen to lead the world because ProtagonistA was a good and pure person 
 From that day on , ProtagonistA was known as the Queen of Heaven and the whole world obeyed ProtagonistA 
A hundred years ago , in the year 1873 , ProtagonistB happened to meet ProtagonistA in the city of Detroit 
 They would often walk around the city together , exploring all the different sights and sounds 
 One day , while they were walking , they came across a large , abandoned building 
 It looked like it had been abandoned for years 
 They decided to go inside to explore 
 As they were walking through the building , they heard a noise 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 They followed the noise until they came to a door 
 Inside the room was ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was crying and shaking , and ProtagonistC looked terrified 
 Emma and ProtagonistB quickly ran to ProtagonistC and hugged ProtagonistC 
 They asked ProtagonistC what was wrong , but ProtagonistC could n't speak 
 ProtagonistC was too scared 
 Alice and Emma decided to take ProtagonistC back to ProtagonistA's house 
 They knew ProtagonistC would be safe there 
 ProtagonistA's parents were very kind and they took ProtagonistC in , and they eventually adopted ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC , never forgot the two girls who saved ProtagonistC that day 
 ProtagonistC would often tell ProtagonistC's own children and grandchildren the story of how Alice and Emma found ProtagonistC , and how they took ProtagonistC in and made ProtagonistC part of their family 
In the year 1250 , the year of the Exodus , a young girl appeared to ProtagonistA on Mount Sinai with a vision , telling ProtagonistA of a great king who was coming 
 This king would lead his people to a new land , where they would be free from the oppression of the Egyptians 
 The girl told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA must follow the king , and ProtagonistA would be safe 
 The king had kept his promise , and ProtagonistA was able to live in peace and prosperity 
 I never knew ProtagonistA very well , but I always felt close to ProtagonistA 
 I was named after ProtagonistA 
 My middle name is ProtagonistA 
 It was ProtagonistB's idea 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB wanted me to have a part of ProtagonistA with me always 
 And I do 
 I think of ProtagonistA every time I sign my name 
 I often wonder what ProtagonistA would think of me now 
 I like to think that ProtagonistA would be proud of the woman I 've become 
 I 'll never forget ProtagonistA 
 They got married shortly after meeting each other , and it was the happiest day of ProtagonistA's life 
 However , ProtagonistA's family was not so thrilled about the marriage 
 ProtagonistB was from a different social class than ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's family was not happy about it 
 They did everything they could to make the marriage difficult , but ProtagonistA was determined to make it work 
 With a lot of hard work and determination , they were able to overcome all of the obstacles that ProtagonistA's family put in their way and they had a happy and successful marriage 
ProtagonistB's family had been in the country for generations , and they were always very proud of their heritage 
The last time I saw ProtagonistA was on the day ProtagonistA died 
 It was a shock to see ProtagonistA like that , and I could tell ProtagonistA was in a lot of pain 
 We talked for a while , and ProtagonistA told me ProtagonistA was ready to go 
 I held ProtagonistA's hand and told ProtagonistA I would miss ProtagonistA 
 The world was on the brink of destruction and ProtagonistA had the power to stop it ; but ProtagonistA did n't 
ProtagonistA was born in 1246 in England 
 It was time for ProtagonistA to speak ProtagonistA's mind , to tell everyone how ProtagonistA really felt 
 It was the hardest thing to do , but ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA's parents exactly what ProtagonistA thought of them and their constant expectations 
 It felt good to finally stand up for ProtagonistA 
 It was the day ProtagonistA finally had the courage to speak ProtagonistA's mind , and ProtagonistA felt like a new person 
ProtagonistA was born into a world of chaos 
 ProtagonistA was born into a world of war and famine 
 ProtagonistA was born into a world of hate and bigotry 
 But ProtagonistA was also born into a world of love and compassion 
 I was honored to be ProtagonistA's mother 
 I loved ProtagonistA with all my heart 
 I would have done anything for ProtagonistA 
 And I did 
 I protected ProtagonistA from the hatred and violence of the world 
 I showed ProtagonistA the beauty of the world 
 I taught ProtagonistA to love 
 I am so proud of ProtagonistA 
 I will always love ProtagonistA 
 And I know that ProtagonistA will always love me 
ProtagonistA's final report was that ProtagonistA had killed eighty - two thousand four hundred and thirty - one Americans 
You 're going to see ProtagonistA 
 The light was so bright it almost hurt ProtagonistA's eyes , but ProtagonistA could n't look away 
 ProtagonistA was transfixed by the beauty of it 
 The sun was the bringer of life , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was finally living 
 ProtagonistA's family always came first and ProtagonistA would do anything for them 
 It was a hot October day , and ProtagonistA was sweating profusely 
 ProtagonistA had been invited to a party that evening , and ProtagonistA wanted to look ProtagonistA best 
 ProtagonistB was walking towards ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could see the sweat on ProtagonistB's brow 
 ProtagonistB was obviously very hot , and ProtagonistA felt sorry for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was smiling , and ProtagonistA smiled back at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB handed ProtagonistA the bouquet and said ,  For ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA was taken aback and said ,  Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB tipped ProtagonistB's hat and walked away 
 ProtagonistA was touched by the gesture , and ProtagonistA decided to go to the party with the bouquet in hand 
It is said that if ProtagonistA should allow ProtagonistA's body to be discovered anywhere on earth , ProtagonistA would immediately reveal the nature of the crime ProtagonistA had committed 
 When the police found ProtagonistA's body in the park , they knew that ProtagonistA had been murdered 
 They also knew who had done it 
 The sun was shining and the sky was blue , and ProtagonistA felt so peaceful and content 
The first thing ProtagonistA's parents said to ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA came to live with them was  Welcome home , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 'm glad to be here 
  ProtagonistA's parents hugged ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was finally home 
 Over time , ProtagonistA's garden began to flourish 
 ProtagonistA's friends and family were amazed at ProtagonistA's talent and dedication 
 They started to call ProtagonistA the  Green Thumb  
 ProtagonistA was thrilled to have found ProtagonistA calling in life 
Dorman , a physician , lamented that ProtagonistA's profession had become so irrelevant , and had become so feeble and uncertain , that ProtagonistA no longer felt ProtagonistA bound to contact it with any amount of importance 
 It seemed like the profession had lost its way , and was no longer able to help people in the way that it once had 
 ProtagonistA's family was getting scared 
 They had all been told that ProtagonistA would n't make it through the year 
 And now , it was looking like they were right 
 So , one day , ProtagonistA's family gathered around ProtagonistA's bedside , and they said their goodbyes 
 They told ProtagonistA how much they loved ProtagonistA , and then ProtagonistA was gone 
 It was a peaceful death , and ProtagonistA's family was grateful for that 
 After a long and difficult labour , their baby was born healthy and happy 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's wife were both relieved and grateful 
I have known ProtagonistA since ProtagonistA was little 
 Now , ProtagonistA is all grown up and is one of the most successful people I know 
 I 'm so proud of ProtagonistA , and I know that ProtagonistA 'll continue to achieve great things in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistB , seeing the look in ProtagonistA's eyes , grabbed ProtagonistA's arm and stopped ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked 
  ProtagonistB tried to talk ProtagonistA out of it , but ProtagonistA was adamant 
 ProtagonistB , shaking ProtagonistB's head , followed ProtagonistA 
 It was the cook , scolding the kitchen - maid , and ProtagonistA soon learned that it was always best to keep out of the way when the cook was in a bad temper 
One afternoon , in the spring of an American year , when the sun filled and the clouds were blue , ProtagonistB hobbled ProtagonistA up the river , and pulled ProtagonistA out of the splashing rose - trees 
 The river was full of fish , and the trees were full of birds , and ProtagonistB was full of love for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA for months , and had finally worked up the courage to speak to ProtagonistA 
 They strolled along the river , talking and laughing , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA all about ProtagonistB's life at sea 
 ProtagonistA was captivated by ProtagonistB's stories , and by the end of the afternoon , ProtagonistA was head - over - heels in love with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to come back to France with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA eagerly agreed 
 They sailed away together , and were married a year later 
 They lived happily ever after , and their love was the stuff of legend 
 ProtagonistA had always loved this plate , it was so beautiful and perfect 
 But now , it was time to say goodbye ProtagonistA had been diagnosed with cancer and given only a few months to live 
 Within minutes , ProtagonistA was gone 
It was a cold , wet , snow - packed February day in the last year of the reign of Henry III 
 ProtagonistA's death was a turning point for the kingdom 
 Henry III was forced to abdicate the throne and ProtagonistA's husband , Edward , became king 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by stories , and loved to tell them to anyone who would listen 
 It was called  The Art of Storytelling  and it was written by ProtagonistB 
 In it , ProtagonistB talked about how stories could be used to help people understand the world around them and find their place in it 
 ProtagonistB also talked about how stories could be used to heal the world 
 ProtagonistA became known as the Storyteller , and ProtagonistA continued to tell stories for the rest of ProtagonistA's life 
 The doctors said it was due to a rare condition and there was no cure 
 ProtagonistA's friends and family were supportive , but there was only so much they could do 
 Even the little things made ProtagonistA mad , like when ProtagonistA's alarm clock did n't go off in the morning or when ProtagonistA's favorite TV show was cancelled 
 One day , ProtagonistA's anger finally boiled over 
 ProtagonistA's family had been told that ProtagonistA was not going to make it and to say their goodbyes 
 However , ProtagonistA's parents had not given up hope and had ProtagonistA transferred to a hospital that specialized in comas 
 The doctors there told them that there was a chance that ProtagonistA could be awoken , but that ProtagonistA would be a different person 
 ProtagonistA's parents agreed to a risky surgery that would transplant ProtagonistA's consciousness into a new body 
 The surgery was a success and ProtagonistA awoke in a new body 
 The first thing ProtagonistA did when ProtagonistA awoke was to abort the transplant 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA never wanted to be a princess 
 But ProtagonistA was born into a royal family and was expected to act like a princess 
 ProtagonistA was expected to be graceful and delicate 
 ProtagonistA was expected to be perfect 
 ProtagonistA was always speaking ProtagonistA's mind , even when ProtagonistA should n't 
 And ProtagonistA was respected and feared 
 ProtagonistA was born in a small village in the middle of nowhere and , from a very early age , ProtagonistA had a great desire to see the world 
 However , ProtagonistB was a very cruel man and ProtagonistB often mistreated ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA divorced ProtagonistB after ten years of marriage and , although ProtagonistA was left with very little money , ProtagonistA was determined to make something of ProtagonistA's life 
 It sounded like somebody was crying 
 It was coming from ProtagonistA's neighbor 's house 
 ProtagonistB answered 
 ProtagonistB was crying 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB's mom was sick and ProtagonistB was scared 
 They went back to the neighbor 's house and took ProtagonistB's mom to the hospital 
 ProtagonistA was disoriented and it took ProtagonistA a moment to remember where ProtagonistA was 
 With ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was pacing back and forth 
 ProtagonistB seemed to be in ProtagonistB's own world , muttering to ProtagonistB 
  Do ProtagonistB know what 's going on?The man turned to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA saw the wild look in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 ProtagonistB was clearly not all there 
 ProtagonistB did n't answer ProtagonistA , just kept pacing 
 The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was going to bed 
 But why?She must have dozed off , because the next thing ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was standing over ProtagonistA , shaking ProtagonistA awake 
 They're coming for ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Who 's coming for me?The men in suits 
 They 're coming to take ProtagonistA away 
 ProtagonistA's heart began to race 
 We have to get out of here ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB began to pace again and ProtagonistA could see the terror in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 There was no way out 
 They were coming for ProtagonistA 
 Mrs 
 Smith had been widowed for many years , and ProtagonistA had always thought that ProtagonistB would never find love again 
 ProtagonistB had met a man online , and they had been corresponding for some time 
 And now , they were finally going to meet in person 
It was on the first of May , in the year 1830 , that ProtagonistA , sitting in ProtagonistA's room at the Oxford , in the house of the Earl of Rosendoll , who was the proprietor of the most luxurious apartments in the city , and who , there being then no people of remarkable riches or distinction in the city , or of any rank whatever , and who were all struck with the envy and favor which prevailed there , exercised the following extraordinary and indeed a most singular power , for it was by means of a little device , employed in France about a hundred years ago , by the name of the trivalent motion or vital force , that ProtagonistA obtained from the presence of objects , either tangible or intangible , that most inconsiderable , and , indeed , that no one , or rather more than few , excepting the courtiers of the court and the nobles and the most important men of state , could possibly have imagined at the time , that any human being , who , such as Carol was , might have a reasonable opportunity of acquiring ProtagonistA's crown 
This is a tale about a man who was born on the Fourth of July , and who went through the Civil War , and who had a son who was killed in the war , and who , after the death of Alice , became the very object of love , or at least the object of much curiosity and much regret , and who , though never having been able to decide whether ProtagonistA was really Carol 's father or had in fact been married to either mother , still believed , with all the force of ProtagonistA's convictions , that ProtagonistA had been conceived in the womb of one of ProtagonistA's paternal grandparents , and that ProtagonistA had been in the process of becoming a man , in a state in which ProtagonistA had never been before , and in which ProtagonistA had never been very happy 
 ProtagonistB lived in a small town in the middle of nowhere and ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB in years 
 When ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA was going to China , ProtagonistB was ecstatic 
 ProtagonistB had always wanted to see the world and now ProtagonistA was going to do it for ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistB insisted on coming along and said ProtagonistB would be fine 
 So , the two of them set off on their adventure 
 They took a long flight to China and when they arrived , ProtagonistB was amazed by the sights and sounds of the country 
 ProtagonistB had never seen anything like it before 
 They spent the next few weeks touring around China , seeing the Great Wall , the Terracotta Warriors , and all the other amazing sights the country had to offer 
 ProtagonistB was in awe of everything ProtagonistB saw and ProtagonistB was so happy to have been able to share this experience with ProtagonistA 
 It was a trip they would never forget 
 ProtagonistA was always either too shy or too aggressive , never just right 
 It was a scary thought , but it was also liberating 
 The thought was both scary and liberating , and it made ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistA could do anything 
On a near - perfect December day in the year 1757 , several hundred years after it had begun , a delegation of strangers landed in Amboise , at the entrance to the great promontory , where the Adroux ringed the top of the high peak , and the promontory with it ; and they were admitted by their hosts , Alice , but they only paid ProtagonistA so much attention , that ProtagonistA had only a vague idea of all the characters ProtagonistA was about to meet ; and , indeed , while ProtagonistA was treating them in this way,—and this author is of opinion that there was some truth in what ProtagonistA said,—they were not amused with ProtagonistA's insolent manner ; but , on the contrary , they were delighted with ProtagonistA's singularities of speech — such an art of speaking , in fact , that ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's voice ; it was already a source of amusement for the officers , and enabled them to strike a most interesting combination of tones — a very singular effect , in fact — and by a few degrees of improvement , the inmates of the gallery were very much amused , and , in consequence , were easily prevailed on to entertain and produce entertainments , of a like character , in the austere and rigid laws of the Colony 
 They were married for 50 years and had three children together
