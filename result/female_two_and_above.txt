ProtagonistA was wearing the black trousers of a captain , a white shirt and a black blouse , with a red sash , and ProtagonistA's hair had been pulled back into a beautiful bun . ProtagonistA was the picture of a perfect naval officer , and ProtagonistA knew it . ProtagonistA's ship was the best in the fleet , and ProtagonistA's crew was the envy of every other captain . ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA could possibly want ... except for one thing . ProtagonistA was lonely . ProtagonistA had never been able to find a partner who could match ProtagonistA's ambition and drive .

When ProtagonistA was sixteen , ProtagonistA's aunt died and ProtagonistA was left completely alone in the world .

ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistB , and they remained friends for many years . ProtagonistA was always glad that they had met that day , in that city so full of life . 
.
ProtagonistB had been ill for some time , and ProtagonistA had been by ProtagonistB's side day and night . Now , in the little room of the King 's house within the great garden behind the house , ProtagonistA sat taking ProtagonistB's hand in she . ProtagonistB was asleep , and ProtagonistA hoped that ProtagonistB would soon wake and be ProtagonistB again . But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB's time was running out , and that ProtagonistA must say goodbye . ProtagonistA leaned over and kissed ProtagonistB's forehead , then sat back and watched ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA remembered all the happy times they had together , and how ProtagonistB had always been there for ProtagonistA . Now ProtagonistA was the one who had to be strong . As ProtagonistA sat there , ProtagonistA saw a butterfly flutter into the room and land on ProtagonistB's chest . It was so beautiful , and ProtagonistA knew that it was a sign from ProtagonistB .

Slowly but surely , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA falling in love with ProtagonistB . And then one day , out of the blue , ProtagonistB proposed . ProtagonistA was shocked but ProtagonistA said yes . And so , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA planning a wedding after all . But as ProtagonistA walked down the aisle towards ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had made the right decision . 
.
ProtagonistA had been desirous of knowing what life would be like after ProtagonistA decided to have a baby , because ProtagonistA could not help but be curious , and had played the part of a constantly curious girl – uh … diary and all – in every conversation . ProtagonistA's friends had all been so excited for ProtagonistA , and had given ProtagonistA a list of things ProtagonistA needed to do to prepare , but after ProtagonistA had done all of those things , ProtagonistA still felt like something was missing . ProtagonistA had read all the books and done all the research , but ProtagonistA still did n't feel like ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA was doing . Was this how it was supposed to feel ? ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistB come in until ProtagonistB was right next to ProtagonistA . Hey , what 's up ?  ProtagonistB asked , kissing ProtagonistA on the forehead . Just thinking ,  ProtagonistA replied . About what?About what it 's going to be like after the baby comes . ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA and took ProtagonistA's hand .  ProtagonistB do n't know , but ProtagonistB 'm excited to find out .

To ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's brother , Mr. Joseph Duryea , of the tower : It was a cold , winter day when ProtagonistB met ProtagonistB's untimely end . ProtagonistB was out on the sea , doing what ProtagonistB loved , when a storm suddenly appeared out of nowhere . ProtagonistB's ship was tossed about like a toy in the waves and eventually capsized . ProtagonistB was thrown into the frigid water and drowned before ProtagonistB's crew could even reach ProtagonistB . When news of ProtagonistB's death reached ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA was left to raise their two young children , ProtagonistC and ProtagonistD , on ProtagonistA's own . But ProtagonistA was a strong woman , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to be strong for ProtagonistA's children . ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to provide for Susan and Jethro , but it was difficult . They were always short on money and food . ProtagonistA was grateful when ProtagonistA's brother , Joseph , offered to let them live in his tower . It was a small space , but it was better than nothing . Susan and Jethro were always asking about ProtagonistB and what ProtagonistB was like . ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to tell them stories about ProtagonistB , but it was hard . ProtagonistA knew that they deserved to know the truth about ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA also knew that it would be too painful for them to hear . One day , ProtagonistA made the decision to tell Susan and Jethro the truth about ProtagonistB's death . It was a difficult conversation , but ProtagonistA knew it was the right thing to do . Susan and Jethro were quiet for a long time after ProtagonistA had finished speaking . But then ProtagonistC said ,  Thank ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA , for telling us the truth . We love ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistD nodded in agreement . ProtagonistA was relieved that ProtagonistA had finally been able to tell ProtagonistA's children the truth about ProtagonistB . It was a weight off ProtagonistA's shoulders . And ProtagonistA knew that , no matter what , ProtagonistA would always be there for Susan and Jethro .

ProtagonistA was lying upon the ground , ProtagonistA's arms stretched out in front of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's legs crossed , ProtagonistA's head resting on the side of ProtagonistA's hands . ProtagonistA was staring up at the sky , wondering what ProtagonistA's life would be like if ProtagonistA could just float away . ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer , and this was ProtagonistA's favorite place to escape to . ProtagonistA would lie here for hours , letting ProtagonistA's mind wander to far off places . Sometimes ProtagonistA would imagine ProtagonistA was a bird , soaring through the sky , free from all ProtagonistA's troubles . Other times ProtagonistA would be ProtagonistB , being whisked away by ProtagonistB's prince charming . No matter where ProtagonistA's mind went , ProtagonistA always felt at peace when ProtagonistA was lying here . It was like ProtagonistA's own little slice of heaven . 
.
ProtagonistA's friends called ProtagonistA's squire , but ProtagonistA would not cast a glance aside , for ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB !

We had just left ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's anchor in the water , when ProtagonistB , in a singular instance , which must have occurred to most of the passengers , jumped into the sea . The captain , who was on the bridge at the time , saw ProtagonistB go overboard and immediately rang the alarm . ProtagonistB was quickly pulled out of the water by one of the crew and brought back on board , where ProtagonistB was given a warm blanket and a cup of hot tea . The captain asked ProtagonistB what had happened , but ProtagonistB could only mutter a few incoherent words before passing out from exhaustion .

ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was supposed to do or where ProtagonistA was supposed to go , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistB .

ProtagonistC stood in the doorway , looking at ProtagonistA with a quizzical expression .  Can ProtagonistC help ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistC asked . ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA spoke up .  ProtagonistA 'm looking for ProtagonistB . Do ProtagonistC know where ProtagonistA can find ProtagonistB ?

But this time was different . This time , ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA in the midst of a crowd of people who were gathered below the palace .

ProtagonistA was just about to sit down when ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance . It sounded like someone was crying . ProtagonistA followed the sound until ProtagonistA came to a clearing . There , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB sitting on the ground , crying ProtagonistB's eyes out . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistA could n't just leave ProtagonistB there .

.
One morning , after the close of our first term , when the pain on my hand was beginning to subside , ProtagonistA issued a paper which ProtagonistA supposed to be a communication from ProtagonistB , for it bore the stamp of ProtagonistB's office , and was filled with the seal of the State . It ran as follows:The King of Hearts desires the pleasure of ProtagonistA's company at a Court Ball to be given this evening in honor of the visiting Princess of Hearts . ProtagonistA was so delighted that ProtagonistA could hardly contain ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA went at once to tell ProtagonistA's father and mother of the good news . They were both pleased , and ProtagonistA's father said ProtagonistA might go if ProtagonistA liked , but ProtagonistA must be back by midnight . ProtagonistA was ready long before the time , and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's parents set out for the palace in good spirits . On their arrival they were ushered into a magnificent hall , where the King and Queen and the Princess were already seated . ProtagonistB was very gracious to ProtagonistA , and asked ProtagonistA to dance with ProtagonistB ; and ProtagonistA did so , feeling quite proud and happy . ProtagonistA noticed , however , that the Queen looked very stern and angry , and ProtagonistA wondered what was the matter . After a time ProtagonistA was sorry ProtagonistA had come , for the Queen kept scowling at ProtagonistA so fiercely that it quite frightened ProtagonistA ; and then , when ProtagonistA was tired of dancing , ProtagonistA wanted to go home , but ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA must stay till midnight . At last the clocks struck twelve , and ProtagonistA was free to go . As ProtagonistA was leaving the hall the Queen said to ProtagonistA in a loud voice ,  ProtagonistA are nothing but a common little girl , and I 'll have ProtagonistA sent to prison for coming here without an ProtagonistA was so astonished at this that ProtagonistA could not speak ; but ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA outside the palace doors in a moment , and running down the steps as fast as ProtagonistA could .

ProtagonistA's family did everything they could to dissuade ProtagonistA from marrying ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was determined . In the end , ProtagonistA got ProtagonistA's way and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were married . The first few years were tough , as ProtagonistA's family continued to disapprove of ProtagonistA's choice and ProtagonistB struggled to find work that could support them . But they persevered and eventually found happiness together . They had two beautiful children and a life that , while not always easy , was filled with love .

There was a man in the country , near the village of Mistral , who was a farmer , very much concerned for the welfare of ProtagonistA's own family , and who had some of the best cattle and sheep in the country , and was very fond of ProtagonistA's poultry , and had a good deal of money in ProtagonistA's account , where ProtagonistA could always find a good price for them . One day , however , ProtagonistB found that ProtagonistB's cattle and sheep had all died , and ProtagonistB's poultry had all been stolen . ProtagonistB was very much distressed at this , and went to the village to ask ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA knew anything about it .

ProtagonistA had been holding ProtagonistA's tongue for far too long . ProtagonistA was tired of being the doormat , the one who always said yes and never complained . Today , ProtagonistA was going to speak ProtagonistA's mind . ProtagonistA started with ProtagonistB . For months , ProtagonistA had been working on a project that was very important to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB kept putting it on the back burner . Today , ProtagonistA went into ProtagonistB's office and told ProtagonistB exactly how ProtagonistA felt . ProtagonistB was surprised , but ProtagonistB listened to ProtagonistA and promised to start giving ProtagonistA's project the attention it deserved . Next , ProtagonistA tackled ProtagonistC . They had been living together for over a year , and ProtagonistA was fed up with ProtagonistC's messy habits . ProtagonistA sat ProtagonistC down and calmly explained how ProtagonistA's mess was affecting ProtagonistA . ProtagonistC was apologetic and promised to do better . Finally , ProtagonistA took on ProtagonistA's parents . ProtagonistA had always been a good daughter , but ProtagonistA was tired of being treated like a child . ProtagonistA sat them down and told them that ProtagonistA was an adult and deserved to be treated as such . They listened , and while they did n't necessarily agree with everything ProtagonistA said , they did start to treat ProtagonistA with more respect . It was the day ProtagonistA finally had the courage to speak ProtagonistA's mind , and it was the best day of ProtagonistA's life .

They hugged each other tightly , and they caught up on all that had happened in the years that they had been apart . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had been travelling the world , and that ProtagonistA had seen and done many amazing things .

ProtagonistA had been eavesdropping on ProtagonistB's conversations for weeks , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was planning to kill ProtagonistA's mother .

For days after ProtagonistA's funeral , ProtagonistB could be seen wandering the streets of their small town , aimlessly kicking at the snow and muttering to ProtagonistB . Some said ProtagonistB went mad with grief ; others said ProtagonistB was simply cursed by God . But whatever the reason , ProtagonistB never recovered from ProtagonistA's death , and ProtagonistB died less than a year later .

The night ProtagonistA was arrested , ProtagonistA awoke to find ProtagonistA in a cell with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was just as scared as ProtagonistA was . They both sat in silence for a while , until ProtagonistB finally spoke up . What did ProtagonistA do ?  ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head .  ProtagonistA do n't know . ProtagonistA was just sitting in ProtagonistA's apartment when the police came and took ProtagonistA away . ProtagonistB nodded .  ProtagonistB was at the park with ProtagonistB's friends when the police came and arrested us . They said we were causing a disturbance , but we were n't doing anything . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB continued to talk throughout the night , sharing their stories and their fears . As the sun began to rise , they both knew that they were going to have to face whatever was happening to them . 
.
ProtagonistA had never known the heart of a woman , and ProtagonistA did not even pretend to be surprised at ProtagonistB's romance .

And now , it seemed , ProtagonistB had found it . ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little jealous . ProtagonistA had always wanted to experience the kind of love that ProtagonistB was now enjoying , but it just seemed to elude ProtagonistA . Maybe one day , ProtagonistA thought . Maybe one day ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistA's own romance . But for now , ProtagonistA was content to be ProtagonistB's friend and confidante , and to share in ProtagonistB's happiness . 
.
ProtagonistA approached the throne upon an armchair not as a king , but as a dandy . ProtagonistA was a success , but no more than a short - cut , with ProtagonistB at full term . ProtagonistA sat down to lunch , and took a stool in the sofas on the other side of the table . ProtagonistB eyed ProtagonistA with a look of amusement .

And ProtagonistA 'm not here to impress ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA 'm here to get something done .  ProtagonistB leaned back in ProtagonistB's chair and regarded ProtagonistA for a moment .  And what is it that ProtagonistA want , ProtagonistA ?   ProtagonistA want ProtagonistB to sign this treaty ,  ProtagonistA said , pulling a document out of ProtagonistA's pocket and sliding it across the table .  It 's a simple trade agreement . Nothing more , nothing less .  ProtagonistB looked at the document , then back at ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA 're very straightforward , are n't ProtagonistA ?   ProtagonistA try to be ,  ProtagonistA said .  It saves time .  ProtagonistB signed the document , then pushed it back across the table to ProtagonistA .  There ProtagonistA go ,  ProtagonistB said .  Now , what was it ProtagonistA wanted to ask ProtagonistB ?   Oh , nothing ,  ProtagonistA said , getting to ProtagonistA's feet .  ProtagonistA just wanted to make sure ProtagonistB were still alive . ProtagonistA 'll be on ProtagonistA's way now .  ProtagonistB stared at ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA walked away , then shook ProtagonistB's head and went back to ProtagonistB's lunch . 
.
ProtagonistA was only six years old when ProtagonistB left for the first time . ProtagonistA did n't understand why ProtagonistB had to go and why ProtagonistB could n't take ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB . All ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistB was going to be gone for a while and ProtagonistA would have to stay with ProtagonistC . The first winter was the hardest . ProtagonistA would often cry ProtagonistA to sleep at night , wondering where ProtagonistB was and if ProtagonistB was ever coming back .

ProtagonistA did n't share a room with your mom or ProtagonistB or any of that stuff that everybody does . said ProtagonistA , turning ProtagonistA's chair around to face the floor .

ProtagonistA swallowed a large melty gulp of ProtagonistA's new favorite drink which was no doubt ProtagonistA's seventh . The drink was a bright pink and tasted like strawberries . It was ProtagonistA's new favorite and ProtagonistA loved it . ProtagonistA had been drinking it all day and was feeling a bit buzzed . ProtagonistA was sitting on ProtagonistA's porch swing , swaying back and forth , when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking by . ProtagonistB stopped and looked at ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 're looking a bit flushed . Are ProtagonistA feeling alright ?  ProtagonistB asked .  ProtagonistA 'm fine ,  ProtagonistA replied ,  ProtagonistA just love this new drink .  ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head and said ,  ProtagonistA should lay off the alcohol . It 's not good for ProtagonistA .  And with that , ProtagonistB walked away . ProtagonistA thought about what ProtagonistB said and decided maybe ProtagonistB was right . ProtagonistA got up from the swing and went inside to pour ProtagonistA a glass of water . 
.
For as long as ProtagonistA could remember , ProtagonistB had been the only person ProtagonistA knew who had ever understood ProtagonistA's whole personality better . Even when ProtagonistA was a little girl and would get upset about something , ProtagonistB would always know how to make ProtagonistA feel better . ProtagonistB was the one person ProtagonistA could always count on , no matter what . So when ProtagonistB passed away suddenly , ProtagonistA was absolutely devastated . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to get through it . But with the support of ProtagonistA's family and friends , ProtagonistA slowly started to heal . And although ProtagonistA still misses ProtagonistB every day , ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistB will always be with ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's heart . 
.
ProtagonistA was working at a dress shop when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB working there . ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB was cute and ProtagonistA started to talk to ProtagonistB . They became friends and started dating . They got married a few years later and had two kids . They were happy together until ProtagonistB died of a heart attack . ProtagonistA was left to raise their kids on ProtagonistA's own . 
.
ProtagonistA , through the thickets of underbrush , through the smog , through the deep dark , lay in the dimness of ProtagonistB's chambers , ProtagonistA's head on ProtagonistA's hooves . ProtagonistA was tired from ProtagonistA's journey and wanted to rest , but ProtagonistA could not . ProtagonistA was too excited to see ProtagonistB again . ProtagonistA had not seen ProtagonistB in years , not since ProtagonistA had left for college . ProtagonistA remembered ProtagonistB as a kind and gentle girl , always ready to help others . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would be able to help ProtagonistA now . ProtagonistA stood up and began to pace . ProtagonistA was too keyed up to sit still . ProtagonistA peered out of the window , trying to see ProtagonistB's house in the distance . ProtagonistA could not see it , but ProtagonistA knew it was there . ProtagonistA was so close , ProtagonistA could almost feel ProtagonistB's presence . ProtagonistA began to trot in place , ProtagonistA's hooves making soft thumping sounds on the floor . ProtagonistA was getting impatient . Finally , ProtagonistA heard footsteps outside the door . ProtagonistA froze , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest . The door opened and ProtagonistB walked in . ProtagonistB was just as ProtagonistA remembered ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was wearing a simple dress and ProtagonistB's hair was pulled back in a loose ponytail . ProtagonistB looked tired , but ProtagonistB's eyes lit up when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA . Rainbow Dash ! ProtagonistB ca n't believe ProtagonistA 're here !  ProtagonistB exclaimed . ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB's help ,  ProtagonistA said urgently .  ProtagonistA do n't know what to do . What 's wrong ?  ProtagonistB asked , concern creasing ProtagonistB's brow . It 's ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC 's in trouble and ProtagonistA do n't know how to help ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA was hoping ProtagonistB could help ProtagonistA . Of course , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB 'll do whatever ProtagonistB can . ProtagonistB sat down and listened as ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistC's problems . ProtagonistA was worried about ProtagonistC and wanted to help , but ProtagonistA did not know how . ProtagonistA was relieved when ProtagonistB offered to help . Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could count on ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said . It 's no problem , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB 'm happy to help . Now , let 's see what we can do for ProtagonistC .  
.
ProtagonistA had just finished eating dinner with ProtagonistA's family and was walking down the aisle of the car park of the local church when the first thing ProtagonistA noticed was ProtagonistB looking back at ProtagonistA from the rear window . The second thing ProtagonistA noticed was the car idling next to ProtagonistB with the driver 's side door open . Without thinking any further , ProtagonistA ran over to the car and jumped in . ProtagonistB , surprised at first , followed suit . They sped off into the night , not knowing where they were going or what they were doing , but knowing that they had to get as far away from that church as possible . 
.
ProtagonistA had been thinking all day if ProtagonistA 'd ever had the chance to speak to ProtagonistB again . It had been years since they had last seen each other and ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistB would even remember ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was about to give up hope when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking down the street . ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB and they ran to each other and hugged . They both started crying and they promised to never lose touch again . 
.
ProtagonistA had never been a particularly violent person . ProtagonistA avoided conflict and preferred to live a peaceful life . However , in ProtagonistA's younger and more vulnerable years , ProtagonistA had never held a weapon above ProtagonistA's head . That changed when ProtagonistA was attacked one night while walking home from work . ProtagonistB came out of the shadows and grabbed ProtagonistA , holding a knife to ProtagonistA's throat . ProtagonistA was terrified . ProtagonistA thought for sure ProtagonistA was going to die . But then , something inside ProtagonistA snapped . ProtagonistA lifted ProtagonistA's hand and grabbed ProtagonistB's wrist , twisting it until ProtagonistB dropped the knife . Then ProtagonistA brought the knife up and stabbed ProtagonistB in the stomach . ProtagonistB fell to the ground , clutching ProtagonistB's wound and groaning in pain . ProtagonistA stood over ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest . ProtagonistA had never felt so alive . In that moment , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was capable of so much more than ProtagonistA had ever thought possible . 
.
One morning , as the sun was leaking its last faint rays , ProtagonistA heard the bell ring . ProtagonistA was in the kitchen preparing the breakfast ProtagonistA 'd have for ProtagonistA's grandkids for the holidays . ProtagonistA was n't looking out of the kitchen window . When ProtagonistA heard the bell , ProtagonistA went to the window to see who it was . It was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had a package for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA signed for it and took it inside . ProtagonistA opened it and found a box of chocolates . They were ProtagonistA's favorite . ProtagonistA smiled and went back to the kitchen to finish preparing breakfast . 
.
ProtagonistA was sitting in the living room of ProtagonistA's house in the suburbs of Ponyville , the fresh air of ProtagonistA's fresh - pitch garden bringing out blue - green flowers that bloomed all afternoon and remained crisp and green all night . The phone beside ProtagonistA's rang , and ProtagonistA picked it up , ProtagonistA's heart already pounding in ProtagonistA's chest .  Hello ?  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's voice trembling .  Is this ProtagonistA ?  the voice on the other end said .  Yes ,  ProtagonistA said .  I 'm sorry to tell you this , but ProtagonistB was in a car accident . ProtagonistB did n't make it .  ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's knees buckle and ProtagonistA collapsed to the floor , the phone still clutched in ProtagonistA's hand . ProtagonistA could n't believe it . This was ProtagonistA's worst nightmare come true . 
.
ProtagonistA was riding ProtagonistB down Mount Fouladuddy when it happened . ProtagonistA was having a quite a pleasant ride when ProtagonistB suddenly stopped and would not move . ProtagonistA tried everything ProtagonistA could think of , but ProtagonistB just would n't budge . ProtagonistA was starting to get worried when ProtagonistA heard a voice behind ProtagonistA .  Hello there ,  the voice said .  It looks like ProtagonistA 're having some trouble . ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistC .  Yes ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistB wo n't move . Let ProtagonistC take a look ,  ProtagonistC said . ProtagonistC walked over and placed ProtagonistC's hand on ProtagonistB's head . After a few moments , ProtagonistB started moving again . There ProtagonistA go ,  ProtagonistC said .  Just give ProtagonistB a little encouragement and ProtagonistB 'll be fine . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistC and continued on ProtagonistA's way . ProtagonistA was amazed at what had just happened and grateful for ProtagonistC's help . 
.
Once upon a time , there was a land called Twilight . It was a magical place where ProtagonistA lived and laughed ProtagonistA's butt off . One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was so handsome and charming that ProtagonistA fell in love with ProtagonistB instantly . They got married and had a beautiful baby girl . They lived happily ever after . 
.
ProtagonistA smiled as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistA's father wash his hands in the sink , then rise to the counter and give ProtagonistB a knowing nod . It was clear that ProtagonistA's father approved of ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was glad . ProtagonistB was a kind and honest person , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could always count on ProtagonistB to tell the truth . 
.
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and watched from behind the large , open window of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been following ProtagonistB for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had first seen ProtagonistB at the market . ProtagonistB was the most beautiful horse ProtagonistA had ever seen , with a long , flowing mane and tail and a coat that shone in the sun . ProtagonistA was determined to buy ProtagonistB , no matter what the cost . ProtagonistA had saved up all ProtagonistA's money and was now ready to make an offer . ProtagonistA just had to wait for the right moment . The opportunity finally came one day when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB in the field behind ProtagonistA's house . ProtagonistA quickly saddled up ProtagonistA's own horse and rode over to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB seemed startled at first , but ProtagonistA quickly won ProtagonistB over with a few kind words and a treat . ProtagonistA then led ProtagonistB back to ProtagonistB's stall and made ProtagonistB an offer . ProtagonistB was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistA was adamant . ProtagonistA promised to take good care of ProtagonistB and even offered to pay more than the asking price . In the end , ProtagonistB agreed and ProtagonistA rode off with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was over the moon . ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA now owned ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA vowed to take good care of ProtagonistB and give ProtagonistB the best life possible . 
.
ProtagonistB had been out fishing all day , and ProtagonistA had been eagerly awaiting ProtagonistB's return . But when the doorbell rang , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistB had just drowned . ProtagonistA was devastated . 
.
ProtagonistA cast the last of ProtagonistA's net on ProtagonistB's second moon , soaring high above the likeness of an alder - maiden in the deep , silent night . It was a cold night , and ProtagonistB's moon was particularly bright . ProtagonistA had been tracking ProtagonistB for weeks , and ProtagonistA knew that this was ProtagonistA's opportunity to finally catch ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a notoriously elusive creature , and ProtagonistA was determined to be the one to capture ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had set ProtagonistA's sights on ProtagonistB's moon and had been patiently waiting for ProtagonistA's chance . When ProtagonistB finally appeared , ProtagonistA was ready . ProtagonistA cast ProtagonistA's net and waited for ProtagonistB to be ensnared . But ProtagonistB was too quick . ProtagonistB dodged the net and flew off into the night , leaving ProtagonistA empty - handed . 
.
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the bank , searching for ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA had been playing with them near the river when ProtagonistA got separated . Now , the sun was setting and ProtagonistA was starting to get scared . ProtagonistA called out their names , but there was no answer . ProtagonistA was just about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a voice . It was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had been looking for ProtagonistA too . They were both relieved and happy to be reunited . They walked back to the river to find the others and continued playing until it was time to go home . 
.
ProtagonistA had taken a rest from ProtagonistA's long and busy life , and now that ProtagonistA was free of the cares of being a wife and mother , ProtagonistA was content to enjoy the moment of happiness which ProtagonistA had prepared for just such an occasion . ProtagonistA had a cup of tea and a book , and ProtagonistA was just about to settle in when ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door . ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and there was ProtagonistB there , who looked to be about the same age as ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was very beautiful , with long blonde hair and blue eyes . ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA's daughter , and ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had come to visit ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was surprised , but ProtagonistA was also very happy to see ProtagonistB . They hugged each other and then sat down to talk . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's own life . They talked for a long time , and it was a very happy visit . 
.
The first time ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA , when ProtagonistA had been a boy called Spike , ProtagonistB had been struck by ProtagonistA's beauty . ProtagonistA was unlike any other girl ProtagonistB had ever seen . ProtagonistA was kind and sweet and always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistB had been instantly smitten . ProtagonistB had tried to talk to ProtagonistA on several occasions , but ProtagonistA had always seemed nervous and shy around ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had been about to give up hope when , one day , ProtagonistA had finally spoken to ProtagonistB . They had struck up a conversation and ProtagonistB had found out that ProtagonistA was interested in the same things as ProtagonistB . They had become friends quickly and ProtagonistB had started to develop deeper feelings for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB had been planning to tell ProtagonistA how ProtagonistB felt , but before ProtagonistB could , ProtagonistA had started dating someone else . ProtagonistB had been heartbroken , but had tried to hide it . ProtagonistB had continued to be friends with ProtagonistA , even though it had been difficult . ProtagonistB had been happy for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA had got married and had children , even though it had made ProtagonistB feel even more alone . Now , many years later , ProtagonistB was still single and ProtagonistA was divorced . They had both come to the same party and , for the first time in years , ProtagonistB had felt that old spark of attraction . They had spent the night talking and laughing and ProtagonistB had felt like ProtagonistB was finally home . 
.
ProtagonistA stood in the shadow of ProtagonistA's mother 's dusty glass cabinet , ProtagonistA's hooves hanging down on the peg to keep ProtagonistA right eye steady . ProtagonistA was looking at the family portrait that hung on the wall . It was taken when ProtagonistA was just a foal , and ProtagonistA's mother and father were both alive . ProtagonistA remembered the day it was taken . They had all been laughing and joking , and ProtagonistA's mother had been so happy . Now , ProtagonistA's mother was gone , and ProtagonistB was barely hanging on . The cancer had taken so much from ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA felt a tear run down ProtagonistA's cheek , and ProtagonistA quickly wiped it away . ProtagonistA did n't want ProtagonistB to see ProtagonistA crying . ProtagonistB was weak enough as it was . 
.
ProtagonistA was on the pedestal of ProtagonistB's bed , drooping down and frowning as ProtagonistA stared up at the stars . It was a clear night , and the stars were shining bright , but ProtagonistA just could n't enjoy them . ProtagonistA was too worried about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had been acting strange lately . ProtagonistB was always either moping around or getting angry for no reason . ProtagonistA had tried to talk to ProtagonistB about it , but ProtagonistB just brushed ProtagonistA off . ProtagonistA was starting to get worried that something was really wrong . ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear ProtagonistB come into the room . When ProtagonistA finally noticed ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA jumped up in surprise . ProtagonistB ! What are ProtagonistB doing ProtagonistB just stared at ProtagonistA for a moment before ProtagonistB finally spoke .  ProtagonistB could n't sleep , so ProtagonistB came to look at the stars . But now ProtagonistB see that ProtagonistA 're here too . Yeah , ProtagonistA could n't sleep either . ProtagonistA was just thinking about ProtagonistA . What about ProtagonistA was just worried about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB 've been acting really strange lately . ProtagonistB sighed and sat down on the bed .  ProtagonistB know . ProtagonistB do n't know what 's wrong with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB just feel really lost right now . Rainbow Dash sat down next to ProtagonistB and put a comforting wing around ProtagonistB .  It 's okay , ProtagonistB . We 'll figure it out together .  
.
ProtagonistA burst through the door to ProtagonistB's room , screaming ,  What 's happened ?  ProtagonistB was sitting on ProtagonistB's bed , looking pale and shaken .  ProtagonistB do n't know ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB was just sitting here and suddenly everything went dark . ProtagonistB ca n't see anything .  ProtagonistA's heart sank . This was ProtagonistA's worst nightmare come true . ProtagonistB had been born blind . And now , it seemed , ProtagonistB was going deaf as well .  Can ProtagonistB hear ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistA asked , desperation in ProtagonistA's voice . But ProtagonistB just shook ProtagonistB's head .  ProtagonistB ca n't hear anything either .  ProtagonistA put ProtagonistA's head in ProtagonistA's hands and wept . This was just too much to bear . 
.
ProtagonistA sat on the bank and stretched out ProtagonistB's hooves before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was a beautiful horse , and ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's owner . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB very much , and ProtagonistA was very grateful to have ProtagonistB . One day , while ProtagonistA was brushing ProtagonistB's coat , ProtagonistA found a grey hair . ProtagonistA was shocked , because ProtagonistA had never seen a grey hair on ProtagonistB before . ProtagonistA knew that this meant that ProtagonistB was getting old , and ProtagonistA was very sad about it . 
.
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's garden , enjoying the last of the twilight . ProtagonistA had half - eaten an apple and was idly tossing the core into the bushes when ProtagonistA saw a movement out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye . ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB sitting on ProtagonistB's haunches , looking at ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's bright eyes . ProtagonistA was startled , but not afraid . ProtagonistA held out ProtagonistA's hand and ProtagonistB came closer , sniffing at ProtagonistA's fingers . Then , to ProtagonistA's amazement , ProtagonistB spoke . Good evening , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB 'm Twilight . ProtagonistB 'm sorry to intrude , but ProtagonistB could n't help but notice ProtagonistA's apple . May ProtagonistB have a bite?Alice was so surprised that ProtagonistA did n't know what to say . ProtagonistA simply nodded and held out the apple . ProtagonistB took a bite , then sat on ProtagonistB's haunches and began to eat . As ProtagonistB ate , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life in the forest . ProtagonistB told of the other animals ProtagonistB lived with and the adventures ProtagonistB had had . ProtagonistA was entranced . ProtagonistA had never met a talking rabbit before , and ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA never would again . When ProtagonistB had finished the apple , ProtagonistB bid ProtagonistA goodnight and hopped away into the darkness . ProtagonistA sat for a long time , thinking about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB . 
.
The first time I saw ProtagonistA drape the tray table of ProtagonistA's crib across the kitchen window , it was ProtagonistB , looking through the window and murmuring ,  Oh , there 's ProtagonistC .  I was so startled that I dropped my book . ProtagonistB turned to me with a smile .  Did n't mean to scare you ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB just wanted to get a better look . I peered out the window with ProtagonistB . Sure enough , there was ProtagonistC standing in the alley below , looking up at us . ProtagonistC was dirty and ragged , but there was something about ProtagonistC's eyes that made me feel sorry for ProtagonistC . Do ProtagonistB think ProtagonistC 's lost ?  I asked . ProtagonistB shrugged .  Maybe . But ProtagonistC looks like ProtagonistC could use a friend . Before I could stop ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB had climbed out the window and was down in the alley with ProtagonistC . I watched from above as they talked and laughed together . It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship . 
.
ProtagonistA fell for the first time in ProtagonistA's life when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was instantly attracted to ProtagonistB and they began dating . ProtagonistA soon realized that ProtagonistB was never going to do anything for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB and was willing to do anything for ProtagonistB . Eventually , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was only in love with the idea of ProtagonistB and not the reality of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA broke up with ProtagonistB and never looked back . 
.
 ProtagonistA too , ProtagonistB ,  gushed ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's eyes sparkling as ProtagonistA turned the thick chain of grass around ProtagonistA to the side .  ProtagonistA 'm so glad we get to be best friends!The two ponies had been inseparable since they were foals , and now they were finally old enough to go on adventures together . They had already explored the meadow and the forest , and now they were venturing into the dangerous Dark Woods . Be careful , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB .  The Dark Woods are full of dangerous creatures . I will ,  promised ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA 'll be careful . But even as ProtagonistA said it , ProtagonistA felt something snake around ProtagonistA's leg , tripping ProtagonistA up . ProtagonistA yelped in surprise as ProtagonistA fell , and ProtagonistB came galloping over . ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA okay ?  ProtagonistB asked , worried . ProtagonistA sat up , and the first thing ProtagonistA saw was the huge , gaping mouth of a snake , ready to strike . 
.
ProtagonistA had been feeling off all day . ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that something bad was going to happen . So when ProtagonistA was walking to the Reynolds house to fetch a glass of water in the middle of the night and ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the parlor , ProtagonistA knew something was wrong . ProtagonistA walked into the room and saw ProtagonistB standing over the body of ProtagonistB's wife with a bloody knife in ProtagonistB's hand . ProtagonistA gasped and ProtagonistB turned around , seeing ProtagonistA in the doorway . ProtagonistB ran towards ProtagonistA , knife raised , and ProtagonistA turned and ran the other way . ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB's footsteps pounding after ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was faster . ProtagonistA made it to the front door and ran out into the night . ProtagonistB chased ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was able to lose ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA ran all the way home and told ProtagonistA's parents what had happened . The police were called and ProtagonistB was arrested for the murder of ProtagonistB's wife . 
.
ProtagonistA was always sitting on ProtagonistB's lap , looking up at the sky . ProtagonistA was never quite sure how old ProtagonistA was , but ProtagonistA always felt younger when ProtagonistA was with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB always hushed ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA spoke , and ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream when ProtagonistA was with ProtagonistB . One day , ProtagonistB passed away . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's anchor in the world . But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would want ProtagonistA to keep looking up at the sky . So that 's what ProtagonistA did . Every day , ProtagonistA would sit on ProtagonistB's lap , even though ProtagonistB was no longer there . And ProtagonistA would look up at the sky , and ProtagonistA would feel ProtagonistB's presence with ProtagonistA . 
.
Some time before the disaster that afflicted the city of Traver , under the watchful eye of the wizard of ProtagonistD , a young maiden named Padma Praline of the house of Pommaries , stood before the Great CENTIME , and told the tale of ProtagonistA , by the spirited chaperone of ProtagonistA .

ProtagonistC was surprised to see ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistC was happy to have ProtagonistA there with ProtagonistC .

Then it spoke . ProtagonistA was a woman of great courage and strength .

.
Rose looked out over the plain , but on the sound of a distant voice ProtagonistA knew exactly where ProtagonistA was . It was the sound of ProtagonistB's voice , calling ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistA turned and ran towards the sound , and as ProtagonistA got closer ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB's figure on the horizon . ProtagonistB was running towards ProtagonistB , and as they met they embraced each other tightly . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was finally home . 
.
ProtagonistA was standing on the street with ProtagonistA's back to the house , looking up at the huge dark building which , between ProtagonistA's legs , was partially illuminated by the darkness of the night . ProtagonistA was wondering what it would be like to live in a place like that , when ProtagonistA heard a voice behind ProtagonistA . Hey , what are ProtagonistA ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistB standing there , looking at ProtagonistA with a mix of confusion and concern . I'm just looking at the building ,  ProtagonistA said . It 's kind of late to be doing that , do n't ProtagonistA think ?  ProtagonistB said . ProtagonistA shrugged .  ProtagonistA guess so . ProtagonistA was just curious about it , that 's all . Well , ProtagonistA should n't be standing out here by ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  It 's not safe . ProtagonistA nodded .  ProtagonistB 're right , ProtagonistA should go . ProtagonistA turned to walk away , but ProtagonistB stopped ProtagonistA . Wait ,  ProtagonistB said .  Let ProtagonistB walk ProtagonistA home . ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA nodded .  Thank ProtagonistB . The man walked with ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's house , and made sure ProtagonistA got inside safely . As ProtagonistA closed the door , ProtagonistA could n't help but wonder if ProtagonistA would ever see that building again . 
.
ProtagonistA felt so tired ProtagonistA could n't even tell the day . All ProtagonistA knew was that it was dark , and ProtagonistA was cold . ProtagonistA had been walking for what felt like hours , but ProtagonistA was n't sure . ProtagonistA was lost . ProtagonistA had been exploring the forest with ProtagonistA's friends when they got separated . ProtagonistA had been walking for what felt like hours , but ProtagonistA was n't sure . ProtagonistA was lost . ProtagonistA was getting scared . Suddenly , ProtagonistA saw a light in the distance . ProtagonistA walked towards it , and ProtagonistA saw a house . ProtagonistA knocked on the door , and ProtagonistB answered . ProtagonistB was surprised to see ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB invited ProtagonistA in . ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA some food and a bed for the night . ProtagonistA was so tired , ProtagonistA fell asleep as soon as ProtagonistA hit the pillow . ProtagonistA was safe now , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistA's way home in the morning . 
.
ProtagonistA , had ProtagonistB ; and , though ProtagonistA was only fifty - one , ProtagonistA was already growing very old indeed . ProtagonistA's hair was thin and white , and ProtagonistA's face was covered in wrinkles . ProtagonistA walked with a stoop , and ProtagonistA's hands trembled when ProtagonistA spoke . ProtagonistB was the only person who really talked to ProtagonistA . Everyone else in the village just ignored ProtagonistA , or spoke to ProtagonistA in a patronising way .

ProtagonistA had always been a bridesmaid ; ProtagonistA's father had promised a wedding for ProtagonistA and had lived up to that . However , when ProtagonistA's father died , ProtagonistA was left with no husband and no wedding . ProtagonistA was forced to move in with ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle , who were not very fond of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was very lonely and felt like ProtagonistA had lost everything . One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had been married to ProtagonistA's best friend , who had died in a car accident . ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA became friends and eventually got married . ProtagonistA was finally able to have the wedding ProtagonistA always wanted , and ProtagonistA was very happy . 
.
ProtagonistA had just gotten off work when ProtagonistA was kidnapped by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was thrown into the back of a van and driven to an unknown location . When the van stopped , ProtagonistA was dragged out and thrown into a dark room . ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB breathing heavily in the darkness . Suddenly , a light was turned on and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB's face . ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's boss ! ProtagonistB had always been creepy , but ProtagonistA never thought ProtagonistB would kidnap ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA tried to scream , but ProtagonistB covered ProtagonistA's mouth with ProtagonistB's hand .  If ProtagonistA make a sound , ProtagonistB 'll kill ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said . ProtagonistA was terrified . ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistB was going to do to ProtagonistA . 
.
ProtagonistA hoped that they would be okay . At least ProtagonistA said so as ProtagonistA rested ProtagonistA's hoof on the end of ProtagonistB's hoof . ProtagonistB appreciated the support and understanding , but ProtagonistB was still worried . ProtagonistB could n't help but worry about the future and what it might hold . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was worried and ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to try and comfort ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that it was n't easy to be in ProtagonistB's position . ProtagonistB was the one who had to make the decisions and ProtagonistB was the one who had to worry about the future . But ProtagonistA was there for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA would support ProtagonistB no matter what happened . 
.
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA knew everything , and yet there was much ProtagonistA knew nothing about . ProtagonistA was always the top of ProtagonistA's class , the teacher 's favorite , and ProtagonistA had never been challenged . That is , until ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was the new kid in school and ProtagonistB was smart , really smart . ProtagonistB knew things that ProtagonistA had never even heard of before . ProtagonistA was fascinated by ProtagonistB and quickly became ProtagonistB's friend . Over time , ProtagonistA learned more and more from ProtagonistB and realized that there was a whole world of knowledge out there that ProtagonistA had never even imagined . ProtagonistA was no longer the smartest person in the room , but ProtagonistA was okay with that because ProtagonistA was learning so much . Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB , for showing ProtagonistA that there was always more to learn .

ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's rock and blinked ProtagonistA's eyes , wondering how to get back to reality . ProtagonistA had been in this strange place for what felt like days , and ProtagonistA was starting to get worried . ProtagonistA had tried everything ProtagonistA could think of to get back home , but nothing had worked . ProtagonistA was just about to give up when ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB looked familiar , but ProtagonistA could n't quite place ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA , it 's me , John . ProtagonistB 've been looking for ProtagonistA everywhere . ProtagonistB 'm so glad ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was confused . ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistB seemed to know ProtagonistA . Where are we ?

But ProtagonistB finally found a way out and ProtagonistB came to find ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was still confused , but ProtagonistA was also starting to feel hopeful . Maybe ProtagonistB could help ProtagonistA get back to reality . Come with ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'll show ProtagonistA the way out . ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's hand and followed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had nothing to lose at this point . Together , they walked through the strange place , until they finally came to a door . ProtagonistB opened it and gestured for ProtagonistA to go through . ProtagonistA hesitated again , but then ProtagonistA took a deep breath and stepped through . When ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA back in ProtagonistA's own bedroom .

The day ProtagonistB first met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was four and a half years old . ProtagonistA was a little girl with blonde hair and blue eyes .

Sweetie-6 was sitting in the park , watching the children play . ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB .  Are n't ProtagonistB going to go home ? said Sweetie-6 , scratching ProtagonistA's head .  ProtagonistB shrugged ProtagonistB's shoulders and said that ProtagonistB did n't know . Sweetie-6 told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB should go home , because it was getting late .

ProtagonistB agreed , and the two of them sat in the park together until it was time for ProtagonistB to go home . 
.
ProtagonistA was brushing ProtagonistB's hair as the sun rose over the sky . ProtagonistB neighed softly as ProtagonistA ran the brush through ProtagonistB's mane . ProtagonistA smiled as ProtagonistA worked , thinking of the days when ProtagonistA would go for rides with ProtagonistA's father on his horse . Those were the days when ProtagonistA was carefree and happy . Now , ProtagonistA was a grown woman with responsibilities . But ProtagonistA still loved spending time with ProtagonistB . It was a special bond that ProtagonistA cherished . 
.
ProtagonistA had been living in the land for many years , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB had been a force in its history . ProtagonistA remembered the stories that ProtagonistB had told ProtagonistA about the land and its people . ProtagonistA also remembered the times when ProtagonistB had helped ProtagonistA to understand the land and its ways . Even though ProtagonistB had passed away a few years before , ProtagonistA had not forgotten ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistA pranced through the air , bouncing on ProtagonistA's wings , ProtagonistA's hooves floating in the swirling air . ProtagonistA felt weightless and free , like ProtagonistA could fly forever . ProtagonistA laughed and somersaulted in the air , enjoying the sensation of the wind rushing through ProtagonistA's fur . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a loud boom and felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's side . ProtagonistA looked down and saw an arrow protruding from ProtagonistA's body . ProtagonistA tried to fly away , but ProtagonistA's wings would no longer move . ProtagonistA plummeted to the ground , the arrow still embedded in ProtagonistA's side . As ProtagonistA lay there , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB approached ProtagonistA , a satisfied smirk on ProtagonistB's face .  Just another trophy for ProtagonistB's collection ,  ProtagonistB said coldly as ProtagonistB pulled out ProtagonistB's knife to skin ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt the life draining out of ProtagonistA's body as ProtagonistA lay there , helpless . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could have flown away and escaped ProtagonistA's fate , but it was too late . The last thing ProtagonistA saw was ProtagonistB's knife coming towards ProtagonistA , before everything went black . 
.
ProtagonistA rode silently toward ProtagonistA's cabin , ProtagonistA's eyes half - closed and ProtagonistA's mind racing in its mind 's eye . ProtagonistA was thinking about the events of the past few days and how everything had changed so quickly . It seemed like only yesterday ProtagonistA had been living a normal life , going to work and spending time with ProtagonistA's friends . But now , ProtagonistA was on the run from the law , and ProtagonistA had no idea what the future held . ProtagonistA was tired , and ProtagonistA just wanted to rest , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving . ProtagonistA had to find a way to clear ProtagonistA's name and find out who was really behind all of this . As ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistA's cabin , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing in the shadows . ProtagonistA tensed up , but ProtagonistA did n't make a sound . ProtagonistB stepped out into the light , and ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB was a woman . ProtagonistB was holding a gun , and ProtagonistB looked very tired .  ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB 've been looking for ProtagonistA .  
.
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a dreamer . ProtagonistA was always off on some new adventure , never content to stay in one place for very long . So when ProtagonistA came to ProtagonistB one day and told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had found a new place for them to live , ProtagonistB was n't really surprised . What did surprise ProtagonistB , however , was the place ProtagonistA had found . Alice , my dear , we 're going to live in a storybook !  ProtagonistA exclaimed . ProtagonistB was sure ProtagonistA must be joking , but it was soon clear that ProtagonistA was serious . ProtagonistA had found an old house in the woods that was said to be the home of ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB was scared at first , but ProtagonistA assured ProtagonistB that there was nothing to be afraid of . After all , it 's just a story ,  ProtagonistA said .  And we 'll be the heroes of our own story . So ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA moved into the old house in the woods and began their adventure . They soon found out that the stories about ProtagonistC were true , but they also found out that ProtagonistC was n't really a bad person . In fact , ProtagonistC was quite lonely and was happy to have some company . ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA became good friends with ProtagonistC and would often sit by the fire and listen to ProtagonistC's stories . It was a magical time for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB knew that this was a story ProtagonistB would always remember . 
.
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day . First , ProtagonistA got a bad grade on ProtagonistA's math test . Then , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB was moving away . To top it all off , ProtagonistA found out ProtagonistC had been hit by a car . ProtagonistA was so upset , ProtagonistA threw down ProtagonistA's chair and leaned forward in the air . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA's whole world was falling apart . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice . It was ProtagonistC , asking ProtagonistA to help ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistC was n't really gone . ProtagonistC was just hurt and needed ProtagonistA's help . ProtagonistA snapped into action and took ProtagonistC to the vet . ProtagonistC was going to be okay . ProtagonistA felt relieved . Even though ProtagonistA's day had started out terrible , it had ended on a good note . ProtagonistA was reminded that ProtagonistA always had the power to help others , even when it felt like ProtagonistA's own world was falling apart . 
.
ProtagonistA was having a terrible time remembering what ProtagonistA had done that morning . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had gotten out of bed and eaten breakfast , but after that , ProtagonistA's mind was a total blank . ProtagonistA racked ProtagonistA's brain , trying to think of anything that could help ProtagonistA remember , but it was all for naught . Finally , ProtagonistA gave up and decided to ask ProtagonistB , if ProtagonistB could help . Oh , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA ,  do ProtagonistB remember what ProtagonistA did this ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA and shook ProtagonistB's head . I'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB ca n't help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was n't with ProtagonistA this morning . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA suddenly remembered something . Oh , that 's right ! ProtagonistA went to the store this morning .  Relief washed over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA finally remembered what ProtagonistA had done . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's help and went on with ProtagonistA's day . 
.
ProtagonistA was conceived in the winter of my year , seventeen months after ProtagonistB was twenty - four years old . ProtagonistA was born in the great Kingdom of Equestria , which was in a tier - one position at the time . However , ProtagonistA quickly rose in the ranks , due to ProtagonistA's great magical abilities . ProtagonistA became a key figure in the kingdom , stabilizing it and making it far more prosperous . ProtagonistA was loved by all , especially ProtagonistA's two closest friends , Malachite of the Crystal Metals and ProtagonistB . The three of them were inseparable , and they always had each other 's backs , no matter what . One day , when they were out on a quest together , they ran into a group of bandits . The bandits were heavily armed and outnumbered them three to one . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends were fighting as best they could , but they were quickly being overwhelmed . Just when it looked like they were about to be defeated , ProtagonistA summoned a powerful magical blast that took out all of the bandits . ProtagonistA's friends were amazed at ProtagonistA's power , and they knew that ProtagonistA was destined for great things . ProtagonistA continued to use ProtagonistA's magic to help ProtagonistA's kingdom , and ProtagonistA soon became one of the most powerful and respected leaders in all of Equestria . ProtagonistA was loved by all , and ProtagonistA lived a long and happy life with ProtagonistA's two best friends by ProtagonistA's side .

ProtagonistA turned at the last minute to see ProtagonistB sitting on the bank watching ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA waved , but ProtagonistB just sat there . ProtagonistA turned back to the river and continued to paddle ProtagonistA's canoe . ProtagonistA had been paddling for hours and was getting tired . ProtagonistA looked back at ProtagonistB again , but this time ProtagonistB was gone . ProtagonistB must have gone home . ProtagonistA sighed and paddled on . 
.
ProtagonistA stood there , still wearing ProtagonistA's royal blue dress . ProtagonistA felt like a fool , like ProtagonistA had been played for a fool . ProtagonistA had been so sure that ProtagonistB had loved ProtagonistA , that ProtagonistB had wanted to marry ProtagonistA . But it turned out ProtagonistB had only wanted one thing from ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had given it to ProtagonistB so easily . ProtagonistA had been so naïve . ProtagonistA felt the tears welling up in ProtagonistA's eyes , but ProtagonistA refused to give ProtagonistB the satisfaction of seeing ProtagonistA's cry . ProtagonistA turned and walked away from ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA's head held high . ProtagonistA would never let anyone take advantage of ProtagonistA like that again . 
.
 ProtagonistB ?  said ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's hoof hovering over the apple cart .  Are ProtagonistB sure ProtagonistB want to do this?I'm positive ,  said ProtagonistB .  After all , we 've been planning this for months . But what if something goes wrong?Nothing will go wrong ,  said ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB have everything under control . ProtagonistA sighed and shook ProtagonistA's head .  ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistB 're right ,  ProtagonistA said .  Because ProtagonistA really do n't want to end up like poor old Mrs. Haggerty . Don't worry , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB wo n't let anything happen to ProtagonistA . With that , ProtagonistA took a deep breath and stepped into the cart . ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a reassuring smile and began to push the cart down the hill . At first , everything went according to plan . The cart picked up speed and ProtagonistA began to scream , but ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA was enjoying the ride . The wind was whipping through ProtagonistA's hair and ProtagonistA felt alive . However , as they neared the bottom of the hill , ProtagonistA saw something that made ProtagonistA's heart stop . There was a large rock in the middle of the path and the cart was heading straight for it . ProtagonistB , look out !  ProtagonistA shouted . But it was too late . The cart slammed into the rock and overturned , sending ProtagonistA flying through the air . ProtagonistA hit the ground with a thud and lay there , motionless . ProtagonistA ! Speak to ProtagonistB !  said ProtagonistB , frantic . But ProtagonistA did n't respond . ProtagonistA was unconscious , and ProtagonistA had no idea what was going to happen to ProtagonistA next . 
.
Alice and ProtagonistA were just finishing up loading ProtagonistA's car when they noticed their neighbors peering through their windows with panicked looks on their faces . Alice and James exchanged confused glances before quickly finishing up and getting into the car . ProtagonistA started the car and began to drive away when they saw the first of the hearers - ProtagonistB running down the street with ProtagonistB's hair flying behind ProtagonistB in the wind . ProtagonistB was followed by a man , and then another , and another , until it seemed like the whole neighborhood was filled with people running and screaming . ProtagonistA quickly turned the car around and drove back to their house . Alice and ProtagonistA ran inside and locked all the doors and windows , huddling together in the living room as they listened to the chaos outside . It was a chilly , dark , and stormy morning , and Alice and James were surrounded by the hysterical hearers . 
.
ProtagonistA has been seen seated on the floor , ProtagonistA's heels creaking slightly , the air of a confined space , and ProtagonistA sits quietly , a slight air of nervousness attached to ProtagonistA , as if ProtagonistA were about to lose ProtagonistA's temper . ProtagonistA has been this way for hours , ever since ProtagonistA was first placed in the room . It was small , with no windows and only one door . The door was locked , and ProtagonistA had the key . ProtagonistA was given food and water , but no one came to check on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was starting to go stir - crazy . Finally , ProtagonistA heard the door unlock and ProtagonistB entered the room . ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB looked around the room before settling ProtagonistB's gaze on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm here to help ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .

But ProtagonistB promise , ProtagonistB 'm here to help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA still did n't say anything . ProtagonistA did n't know what to say . I'm going to get ProtagonistA out of here , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  But ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA's help . ProtagonistA finally found ProtagonistA's voice .  What do ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA to do ?  ProtagonistA asked . ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA to trust ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB replied . ProtagonistA thought for a moment before ProtagonistA finally nodded ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA did n't know what else to do . ProtagonistA had to trust ProtagonistB if ProtagonistA wanted to get out of there . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA what ProtagonistB needed ProtagonistA to do and ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB's instructions . ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA did n't want to stay in that room any longer . ProtagonistA did everything ProtagonistB asked and finally , ProtagonistA was free . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA was brave and ProtagonistA smiled . ProtagonistA was finally free .

ProtagonistA stood there , ProtagonistA's hooves resting on the ground . ProtagonistA was a beautiful horse , with a long mane and tail . ProtagonistA had been ridden by many people , but ProtagonistA's favorite was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB would come to the farm every day and brush ProtagonistA's mane and give ProtagonistA a carrot . One day , ProtagonistB did n't come to the farm . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB . The next day , ProtagonistB came to the farm , but ProtagonistB was different . ProtagonistB was sad and ProtagonistB's eyes were red . ProtagonistB did n't say anything , ProtagonistB just hugged ProtagonistA's neck and cried . ProtagonistA knew that something was wrong , but ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA just stood there and let ProtagonistB cry .

What 's wrong , ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked , still smiling despite the sudden change in atmosphere . I'm out of cupcakes ,  ProtagonistB said , looking miserable .  And ProtagonistB really wanted one . Oh , ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's smile fading . ProtagonistA knew how much ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistB's cupcakes .  ProtagonistA can make ProtagonistB another one . It 's not the same ,  ProtagonistB said , pouting .  ProtagonistB wanted that one . ProtagonistA tried to console ProtagonistB , but it was no use . ProtagonistB was out of cupcakes , and ProtagonistB was not happy about it .

ProtagonistA was at the dinner party , waiting for ProtagonistB , to apologize for not coming sooner . ProtagonistA was getting impatient , as the minutes ticked by and ProtagonistB still had n't shown up . Finally , ProtagonistA decided to go looking for ProtagonistB .

ProtagonistA had taken to riding into ProtagonistA's house on ProtagonistA's pink saddle hoof , noting the rows of fifth - story windows that led from ProtagonistA's backyard down into the city . It was a short ride , but it made ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA would trot down the street , ProtagonistA's pink saddle and hooves shining in the sun , and people would stop and stare . Some would even applaud . ProtagonistA loved the attention , but ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistC even more . ProtagonistC was the one who had brought ProtagonistA this far in life , and ProtagonistA was grateful for every moment they spent together . 
.
There was ProtagonistA . They had been together for two years and were very happy . One day , ProtagonistB proposed to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA said yes . They were both very excited and began planning their wedding . Everything was going great until ProtagonistC found out about the engagement . ProtagonistC was not happy about it and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could not marry ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was heartbroken and did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistC and did n't want to disobey ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistA also loved ProtagonistB . After much thought , ProtagonistA decided to elope with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew it would make ProtagonistC angry , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA was going to marry ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistA was lying on ProtagonistA back in the grass , looking up at the stars . ProtagonistA felt someone tilt ProtagonistA back , and ProtagonistA looked up to see ProtagonistB standing over ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was holding a telescope , and ProtagonistB offered it to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA took it and looked through it , gasping at the sight of the stars up close . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about the constellations and the stories behind them . ProtagonistA was entranced . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and lay back down , staring up at the stars again . ProtagonistA felt at peace , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget this night . 
.
ProtagonistA stood in the dim light of the distance , ProtagonistA face downcast and blue eyes fixed on the ground below . ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had received the news . It seemed like ProtagonistA's feet had a mind of their own , carrying ProtagonistA away from ProtagonistA's old life and into this new one . ProtagonistA did n't know what to expect , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep going . The sun was setting now , and ProtagonistA could see a faint light in the distance . ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was a lamp . And then ProtagonistA saw the house . It was small and rundown , but it was home . ProtagonistA walked up to the door and knocked . ProtagonistA heard footsteps inside , and then the door opened . ProtagonistB stood there , ProtagonistB's face lined with years of worry and hardship . But when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB's eyes lit up with hope . ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA were never coming back . ProtagonistA smiled and stepped inside .  ProtagonistA 'm home ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm finally home .  
.
ProtagonistA , took a moment to admire the view . The sun was setting behind the mountains , and the sky was a beautiful shades of orange and red . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was on top of the world . ProtagonistA was about to head back inside when ProtagonistA saw something out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye . It was a rainbow ! ProtagonistA had never seen one in real life before . ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA started to run towards it . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that the rainbow was actually a bridge . And on the other side of the bridge was a castle ! ProtagonistA had never seen anything so beautiful in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was about to cross the bridge when ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name . It was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB must have followed ProtagonistA . Rainbow Dash , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked . I'm going to cross this bridge and explore that castle ,  ProtagonistA replied . But ProtagonistA do n't even know what 's on the other side ,  ProtagonistB said . That 's why ProtagonistA 'm going to find out ,  ProtagonistA said . And with that , ProtagonistA started to cross the bridge . 
.
ProtagonistB eyed ProtagonistA , but had no intention of touching ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always so perfect and put - together , and ProtagonistB was a bit of a mess . ProtagonistB did n't want to ruin ProtagonistA's perfect image with ProtagonistB's own messiness . But then ProtagonistA did something unexpected . ProtagonistA reached out and touched ProtagonistB's cheek , wiping away a stray tear .  It 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm here for ProtagonistB .  From that moment on , ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB could always count on ProtagonistA to be there for ProtagonistB , no matter what . 
.
ProtagonistA , sat at ProtagonistB's desk , ProtagonistA's hooves resting on the very smooth surface of the paper . ProtagonistA had been curious about this strange object ever since ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB using it . ProtagonistA had been trying to figure out how to use it ProtagonistA , but so far , ProtagonistA had n't had much success . Suddenly , the door to the room opened and ProtagonistB walked in . ProtagonistA quickly jumped off the desk , hoping ProtagonistA had n't been caught . But ProtagonistB just smiled and walked over to ProtagonistA . It 's okay , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB do n't mind if ProtagonistA use ProtagonistB's desk . In fact , ProtagonistB think it 's great that ProtagonistA 're curious about it . ProtagonistB then showed ProtagonistA how to use the desk . ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA how to hold the pen and how to make marks on the paper . ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA immediately started trying to write ProtagonistA's name . That 's great , ProtagonistA !  said ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA 'll be writing like a pro in no time . ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had finally figured out how to use the desk . And it was all thanks to ProtagonistA's curiosity . 
.
ProtagonistA cracked open ProtagonistA's newspaper , nudged the option beneath the headline Today , ProtagonistA was going to write a story about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been meaning to for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had first met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was an interesting person , to say the least . ProtagonistB was always well - dressed and put - together , but there was something about ProtagonistB that made ProtagonistA want to know more . As ProtagonistA began to write , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA getting more and more into the story . ProtagonistA detailed ProtagonistB's life , from ProtagonistB's childhood to ProtagonistB's present day . ProtagonistA wrote about ProtagonistB's successes and ProtagonistB's failures , ProtagonistB's relationships and ProtagonistB's friendships . ProtagonistA even included a quote from ProtagonistB , about the importance of always moving forward . By the time ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had really captured who ProtagonistB was as a person . ProtagonistA hoped that ProtagonistA's readers would feel the same way . 
.
ProtagonistA whistled an old , hoof - tired tune as ProtagonistA peered around the edge of ProtagonistA's cottage at the vast , arid expanse beyond the great umbrella of emerald leaves that crowned the ceiling . ProtagonistA had been living in this cottage for years , ever since ProtagonistA had been forced to retire from ProtagonistA's post as a royal guard . It was n't the life ProtagonistA had envisioned for ProtagonistA , but it was peaceful and ProtagonistA was content . ProtagonistA had been born and raised in the bustling city of Camelot . As a child , ProtagonistA had dreamed of becoming a knight like ProtagonistA's father . When ProtagonistA was old enough , ProtagonistA enlisted in the guard and worked ProtagonistA's way up the ranks . For years , ProtagonistA served the ProtagonistC and queen faithfully . But then , one day , ProtagonistB was hired . ProtagonistB ProtagonistA was soon demoted and then , eventually , forced to retire . ProtagonistB , quickly became ProtagonistC's favorite . ProtagonistB was always by ProtagonistC's side , protecting ProtagonistC and serving ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a twinge of jealousy , but ProtagonistA pushed it down . ProtagonistA was happy in ProtagonistA's cottage and did n't need ProtagonistC's approval . But now , as ProtagonistA looked out at the empty wasteland , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a sense of longing . ProtagonistA missed the excitement of Camelot . ProtagonistA missed the king and queen . And , most of all , ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistA sat up on the front step of the house with ProtagonistA's eyes closed . ProtagonistA was trying to remember the dream ProtagonistA had just been having . It was something about a rabbit and a hole . ProtagonistA could n't quite remember . ProtagonistA heard someone coming up the walk and ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes . It was ProtagonistB .  Good morning , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB was just out for ProtagonistB's morning walk and ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA sitting here . ProtagonistB hope ProtagonistA 're doing well .   ProtagonistA 'm fine , thank ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA was just trying to remember a dream ProtagonistA had .   That 's interesting ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB sometimes have trouble remembering ProtagonistB's dreams , too . Well , ProtagonistB 'll let ProtagonistA get back to it . Have a good day .   Thanks , you too ,  ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB walk away and then ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes again . Maybe if ProtagonistA concentrated hard enough , ProtagonistA could remember the dream . 
.
ProtagonistA had been waiting for the moment , talking to ProtagonistB , when it would happen : here were ProtagonistA's feet , well - nigh barefoot , with their unkempt , patchy hair , and ProtagonistA's hands folded under the lids , as if ProtagonistA had been carrying them for some months , so that ProtagonistA's hands should have a little more room , and ProtagonistA's fingers a little less clumsy , than when ProtagonistA was twelve . It had been a long time since ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was excited to finally be able to talk to ProtagonistB about what was happening in ProtagonistA's life . When ProtagonistA was younger , ProtagonistA had been scared of ProtagonistB , but now ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a kind and wise old man . So , ProtagonistA , what have ProtagonistA been up to ?  ProtagonistB asked , after they had exchanged pleasantries . Oh , not much ,  ProtagonistA replied .  ProtagonistA 've just been waiting for the moment , talking to ProtagonistB , when it would happen . And what is it that ProtagonistA 're waiting for , ProtagonistB's dear?I'm waiting for ProtagonistA's feet to grow , so that ProtagonistA can go barefoot more often . ProtagonistA 'm also waiting for ProtagonistA's hands to be a little less clumsy , so that ProtagonistA can do more things with them . I see ,  ProtagonistB said , nodding ProtagonistB's head .  And why do ProtagonistA want to go barefoot more often?I do n't know ,  ProtagonistA said .  It just feels right . Like it 's something ProtagonistA 'm supposed to do . And why do ProtagonistA want ProtagonistA's hands to be less clumsy?So that ProtagonistA can do more things with them . ProtagonistA want to be able to write and draw and build things . I see ,  ProtagonistB said again .  And have ProtagonistA been doing any of those things?Yes ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 've been writing stories and drawing pictures . And ProtagonistA just finished building a model of a castle out of cardboard boxes . That sounds like a lot of fun ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA 're very good at all of those things . I am ,  ProtagonistA said .  But ProtagonistA 'm still waiting for the moment when it will all come together and ProtagonistA 'll be able to do even more . I'm sure that moment will come , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  Just keep waiting and working hard , and it will happen .  
.
ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's wings for more than a year when ProtagonistA discovered what ProtagonistB , had been planning for a good long while . It seemed that ProtagonistB had been secretly stockpiling weapons and planning to overthrow the king . When ProtagonistA confronted ProtagonistB about it , ProtagonistB tried to kill ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was able to escape , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to warn the king . ProtagonistA flew as fast as ProtagonistA could to the palace and told the king what was happening . The king and his army were able to stop ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's rebels before they could do any damage . ProtagonistA was hailed as a hero and ProtagonistA was able to live happily ever after . 
.
ProtagonistA sat down and just watched as ProtagonistB squatted beside ProtagonistA and watched ProtagonistB draw ProtagonistB's bow and day out . ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by ProtagonistB's ability to shoot an arrow with such accuracy , and ProtagonistA was determined to learn how to do it ProtagonistA . As ProtagonistA watched , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB take careful aim and then release the arrow . It flew straight and true , hitting the target dead center . ProtagonistA clapped ProtagonistA's hands in excitement , eager to try it ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA how to hold the bow and how to position the arrow . ProtagonistB then helped ProtagonistA take aim and release the arrow . It flew wide of the target , but ProtagonistA was thrilled nonetheless . ProtagonistA continued to practice , and before long , ProtagonistA was hitting the target just as accurately as ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was proud of ProtagonistA and grateful to ProtagonistB for teaching ProtagonistA . 
.
ProtagonistA sat at ProtagonistA's desk and watched as ProtagonistB leaned ProtagonistB's head onto ProtagonistA's shoulder . It was a comfortable silence between them , one that did n't need to be filled with words . ProtagonistA was content just to sit there and be with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was going through a tough time and ProtagonistA wanted to be there for ProtagonistB , even if it was just in silence . 
.
ProtagonistA was walking through the woods , thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how ProtagonistA wished things were different . ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistB and how ProtagonistB always seemed to be so strict with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could just leave and never come back . As ProtagonistA was thinking these things , ProtagonistA heard a noise behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA turned around and saw a man with a knife , coming towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die . As the man got closer , ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA ,  Oh , f - f - fucks if ProtagonistA kill you now .  ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistB had not forbidden ProtagonistA to leave . 
.
ProtagonistA was lying on the floor of ProtagonistA's room , bending forward . ProtagonistA had been there for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had received the news . ProtagonistA could n't believe it was true , that ProtagonistA's life was over . It did n't seem real . ProtagonistA was only twenty - five . It was n't supposed to happen like this . ProtagonistA heard the door open and ProtagonistB came in . ProtagonistB sat down on the floor next to ProtagonistA and put ProtagonistB's arm around ProtagonistA . I'm so sorry , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said . ProtagonistA turned to ProtagonistB and buried ProtagonistA's face in ProtagonistB's shoulder . ProtagonistA cried until ProtagonistA had no tears left . Then ProtagonistA got up and walked out of the room . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep going , even though ProtagonistA did n't know how . 
.
ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistA's hoof out of ProtagonistB's eyes , but fished out a few strands of pony hair , like ProtagonistA always had . It was a habit that ProtagonistA had developed over the years , ever since ProtagonistB was born . Whenever ProtagonistA would find a stray hair on ProtagonistB's head , ProtagonistA would carefully remove it , making sure not to hurt ProtagonistB . It was a small act of love that ProtagonistA did every day , and it always made ProtagonistA feel better . Even though ProtagonistB was now a grown pony , ProtagonistA still liked to do it . It was a way for ProtagonistA to show ProtagonistA's love and care for ProtagonistB , even if ProtagonistB was no longer a little filly . 
.
ProtagonistA had only once thought ProtagonistA would have a family , but now ProtagonistA believed that it was n't such a bad idea . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner and never really felt the need for a partner or children , but as ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA started to feel differently . Maybe it was because all ProtagonistA's friends were getting married and having kids , or maybe ProtagonistA was just feeling lonely , but whatever the reason , ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA wanted to try for a family of ProtagonistA's own . ProtagonistA started dating and went on a few dates with some nice guys , but none of them felt like the right fit . Then ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was different than any of the other guys ProtagonistA had dated . ProtagonistB was kind , funny , and most importantly , ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistA was the only person in the world that mattered . They started dating seriously and after a few months , they got married . ProtagonistA was happy and felt like ProtagonistA had finally found the family ProtagonistA always wanted . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had two beautiful children together and they were always surrounded by love . ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA made the right decision when ProtagonistA decided to try for a family of ProtagonistA's own . 
.
When ProtagonistA froze in the doorway of ProtagonistA's house , ProtagonistB came toward ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was a tall , dark figure , draped in a cloak that seemed to absorb all the light around it . In ProtagonistB's hand ProtagonistB held a long , sharp blade . ProtagonistA's heart raced as ProtagonistB approached ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA tried to scream , but no sound would come out . ProtagonistA tried to run , but ProtagonistA's feet were rooted to the spot . ProtagonistA was paralyzed with fear . ProtagonistB reached ProtagonistA and grabbed ProtagonistA by the throat . ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistB's cold , slimy skin against ProtagonistA's own . ProtagonistA could smell ProtagonistB's foul breath . ProtagonistB stared at ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's cold , dead eyes and then ProtagonistB spoke . I've come for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 're coming with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA could n't resist as ProtagonistB dragged ProtagonistA away . ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistB was taking ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA knew it could n't be good . ProtagonistA was terrified of what ProtagonistB might do to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA tried to struggle , but it was no use . ProtagonistB was too strong . ProtagonistA was completely helpless against ProtagonistB . Eventually , ProtagonistB brought ProtagonistA to a dark , dank dungeon . ProtagonistB threw ProtagonistA into a cell and then locked the door . ProtagonistA was left alone in the darkness , terrified of what ProtagonistB might do to ProtagonistA next . 
.
ProtagonistA was lying on ProtagonistA's back , gazing up into the sky . ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace wash over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA watched the clouds drift by . ProtagonistA was content just to lie there and take in the beauty of the day . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistA sat up and looked around , but there was no one there . ProtagonistA shrugged and lay back down , but the voice came again , louder this time .  ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistA , where are ProtagonistA ?  It was ProtagonistB's voice . ProtagonistA got up and followed the sound until ProtagonistA came to the edge of a cliff . ProtagonistA looked down and saw ProtagonistB far below , clutching at the edge of a precipice .  ProtagonistA ! Help ProtagonistB !  ProtagonistB cried . Without hesitation , ProtagonistA leapt off the cliff and flew down to save ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistA stood and watched ProtagonistA's sister Dash ProtagonistB float by . It was a beautiful sight . The sun was setting and the sky was a beautiful orange . ProtagonistB looked so peaceful as ProtagonistB floated by . 
.
ProtagonistB was lying down under the wing of ProtagonistA , staring up at ProtagonistA's blue and white Pip Puff . ProtagonistB was thinking about how much ProtagonistB loved flying and how happy ProtagonistB was to be able to share that love with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB felt a warm breeze blowing through the feathers on ProtagonistB's back and knew that ProtagonistA was also enjoying the moment . 
.
ProtagonistA had spent the day trying to convince ProtagonistB to let ProtagonistA's ride to the Everfree . ProtagonistA was tired of being stuck in ProtagonistC and wanted to explore the forest . ProtagonistB was hesitant , but finally relented . They set off on their journey and ProtagonistA was soon lost in thought , imagining all the adventures ProtagonistA would have . Suddenly , ProtagonistA was brought out of ProtagonistA's reverie by a rustling in the bushes . ProtagonistB had disappeared and ProtagonistA was now alone . ProtagonistA called out , but there was no answer . ProtagonistA began to feel scared and alone . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name . It was ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistB had been hiding , trying to scare ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistA was not amused . ProtagonistA was angry and scared . ProtagonistA did n't want to go back to ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistA did n't want to stay in the forest either . ProtagonistA was stuck in the middle , not knowing what to do . 
.
At the time , ProtagonistA was just about to head off to meet ProtagonistB . They were n't going to let ProtagonistA leave until ProtagonistA had convinced ProtagonistB to do so . ProtagonistA had been trying to get ProtagonistB to come with ProtagonistA for weeks , but ProtagonistB always said no . ProtagonistA was finally going to convince ProtagonistB today . ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB's house and knocked on the door . When ProtagonistB answered , ProtagonistA started talking . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the great time they would have and how much fun they would have . ProtagonistA finally convinced ProtagonistB to come with ProtagonistA and they left for their adventure . 
.
ProtagonistA was a princess and ProtagonistA was not going anywhere . ProtagonistA was content to stay in ProtagonistA's castle and rule ProtagonistA's kingdom . ProtagonistA had a loyal subjects and a loving family . ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life the way it was . One day , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA's castle and asked ProtagonistA to marry ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistA eventually agreed . ProtagonistA left her kingdom behind and went off to live with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's new life , but ProtagonistA always missed ProtagonistA's old kingdom . 
.
ProtagonistA was standing there , wondering how to explain ProtagonistA's pregnancy without sounding like an idiot . ProtagonistA had only been with ProtagonistB for a few months , and ProtagonistA was already pregnant . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to tell ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistB would be mad . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and decided to just tell ProtagonistB the truth . ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's house and knocked on the door . When ProtagonistB answered , ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA 'm pregnant . At first , ProtagonistB did n't say anything . ProtagonistB just stood there , staring at ProtagonistA . Then , ProtagonistB asked ,  ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA was n't sure , but ProtagonistA thought it had something to do with the fact that they had unprotected sex . ProtagonistB was quiet for a moment , then ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB 'm not ready to be a father . ProtagonistA was heartbroken . ProtagonistA had been hoping ProtagonistB would be happy about the news . ProtagonistA turned and walked away , tears streaming down ProtagonistA's face . 
.
ProtagonistA had ruptured ProtagonistA's ACL playing soccer with ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA had been told by the doctor that ProtagonistA would never be able to play again . This was devastating news for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was also told that ProtagonistA would need to have surgery to repair the damage . This would be a long and difficult recovery process . After much thought , ProtagonistA decided to have the surgery . During ProtagonistA's recovery , ProtagonistB , was by ProtagonistA's side every step of the way .

.
It was in the year 1763 when , in a county in western France , a small town named Vernay was formed , and the village of Neuve - Chalmers had its first residents . The name and the first and only dame which has ever been mentioned in the history of France , was Mary Moodie , a little lady of twenty - one , with a pretty face , fine features , and freckles , who , with ProtagonistB , was well known in the world for ProtagonistA's literary talent and for ProtagonistA's indomitable resolution .

Despite being the only residents , the couple was well known in the world for their literary talent and ProtagonistA's indomitable resolution .

It was the perfect place to live if you wanted to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city . One day , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were out walking in the forest when they came across a small cottage . It looked like it had been abandoned for years . They decided to explore it and see if there was anything of value inside . As they entered the cottage , they were surprised to find that it was clean and well - kept .

They would imagine what their story was and how they ended up living in a hidden cottage in the forest . The years went by and eventually , Mary and John passed away . But , their story and the story of the hidden cottage in the forest lived on . 
.
ProtagonistA looked rather like a bimbos older or younger than ProtagonistA had been when ProtagonistA first met ProtagonistB for the first time , considering the circumstances . ProtagonistA was wearing a tight dress and high heels , and ProtagonistA's hair was styled in a way that made ProtagonistA look like ProtagonistA was ready for a night out on the town . However , there was something about ProtagonistA that made ProtagonistB suspect that ProtagonistA might be up to something . ProtagonistB was not the type of person to judge someone based on their appearance , but ProtagonistB could not help but be suspicious of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB had met ProtagonistA for the first time a few weeks ago , and ProtagonistA seemed like ProtagonistA was hiding something . ProtagonistB was not sure what it was , but ProtagonistB was determined to find out . The next time ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB decided to follow ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was not sure what ProtagonistB was looking for , but ProtagonistB was hoping to find some clues . ProtagonistB followed ProtagonistA to a bar , and ProtagonistB watched as ProtagonistA talked to a few men . It was clear that ProtagonistA was flirting with them , and ProtagonistB was not sure what to think . ProtagonistB was about to leave when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA leave with one of the men . ProtagonistB followed them to a hotel , and ProtagonistB watched as they went into a room together . ProtagonistB was shocked , and ProtagonistB was not sure what to do . ProtagonistB was about to call the police when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA leave the room . It was clear that ProtagonistA had been up to something , and ProtagonistB was not sure what to do . ProtagonistB decided to confront ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA had been up to . ProtagonistA denied everything , but ProtagonistB was not convinced . ProtagonistB was about to call the police when ProtagonistA finally confessed . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had been meeting men for money . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA needed the money , and ProtagonistA did not know what else to do . ProtagonistB was shocked , and ProtagonistB did not know what to say . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to get help , and ProtagonistB would not be able to help ProtagonistA anymore . ProtagonistA was heartbroken , and ProtagonistA begged ProtagonistB to help ProtagonistA . However , ProtagonistB was not sure what ProtagonistB could do . ProtagonistB did not want to get involved , and ProtagonistB did not want to see ProtagonistA get hurt . In the end , ProtagonistB decided to call the police . ProtagonistA was taken away , and ProtagonistB never saw ProtagonistA again . ProtagonistB was relieved that ProtagonistB had made the right decision , and ProtagonistB was glad that ProtagonistB had not gotten involved . 
.
ProtagonistB did not ask ProtagonistA to do anything , said ProtagonistC , and it was not a question ProtagonistB had thought about thoroughly , much less questioned . ProtagonistB was simply going about ProtagonistB's day , doing ProtagonistB's chores and minding ProtagonistB's own business , when ProtagonistB suddenly had the urge to ask ProtagonistA to help ProtagonistB with something . It was a small thing , really , but ProtagonistC could tell that it meant a lot to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA hesitated at first , unsure if ProtagonistA wanted to help or not , but ProtagonistC could see the love and appreciation in ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistC knew that ProtagonistC could n't say no , so ProtagonistC agreed . It did n't take long for ProtagonistA to realize that helping ProtagonistB was one of the best things ProtagonistA could have ever done . Not only did ProtagonistA feel good about ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA also felt closer to ProtagonistB than ever before . It was a beautiful moment that they shared , and ProtagonistA will always cherish it . 
.
When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was so excited ProtagonistA had barely remembered what had happened the night before . ProtagonistA had been to the best party ever , and ProtagonistA was just about to go to bed when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's phone at the club . ProtagonistA was so upset that ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's phone , and ProtagonistA was even more upset when ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's purse at the club as well . ProtagonistA was so upset that ProtagonistA decided to go back to the club to look for ProtagonistA's phone and ProtagonistA's purse . When ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's purse , but ProtagonistA could n't find ProtagonistA's phone . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA's phone , and ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had seen it , but ProtagonistB did n't know where it was . ProtagonistA was so upset that ProtagonistA decided to go home . When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA went to bed , and ProtagonistA was so tired that ProtagonistA fell asleep . 
.
ProtagonistA had been so anxious for ProtagonistB to take ProtagonistA's first flight ProtagonistA had not known until that moment that the spell they were about to cast was for something else altogether . ProtagonistA had been so excited to finally be able to experience what it was like to fly and see the world from above . But as ProtagonistA stood there , ready to take off , ProtagonistA realized that this was not what ProtagonistB had meant at all . ProtagonistB had been trying to warn ProtagonistA , to tell ProtagonistA that they were about to cast a spell that would take them to a different world entirely . But ProtagonistA had been so caught up in ProtagonistA's own excitement that ProtagonistA had n't heard ProtagonistB . And now it was too late . ProtagonistA could feel the magic taking hold of ProtagonistA , pulling ProtagonistA into the unknown . ProtagonistA did n't know what to expect , but ProtagonistA knew that whatever was waiting for ProtagonistA , it would be an adventure . 
.
ProtagonistB watched as ProtagonistA twisted and turned , ProtagonistA's hooves shifting as ProtagonistA tried to keep the position . It was a difficult feat , but ProtagonistA was determined to succeed . ProtagonistA had been practicing for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to get the hang of it . As ProtagonistB watched , ProtagonistB felt a sense of pride welling up inside of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's best friend , and ProtagonistB was so proud of ProtagonistA for never giving up . ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA would be a great dancer one day . 
.
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the rocking chair , ProtagonistB's hooves beneath ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was asleep , ProtagonistB's head resting on ProtagonistA's lap . ProtagonistA rocked gently back and forth , a content expression on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA looked down at ProtagonistB , a soft smile on ProtagonistA's lips . It was times like these that ProtagonistA cherished the most . Just ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB , spending time together in peace and quiet . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would grow up to be a strong , independent mare , but for now ProtagonistA was happy to just sit and enjoy the moment . 
.
ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way to the big horse show in town . ProtagonistA had been practicing hard and was excited to show off ProtagonistA's skills . ProtagonistB was watching over ProtagonistA's hooves - a delicate balance , ProtagonistA reasoned , between worry and excitement - and Shining Armor was resting on ProtagonistA's shoulder . As they approached the arena , ProtagonistA could see the other horses and riders getting ready . ProtagonistA felt a little nervous but was confident in ProtagonistA's abilities . When it was ProtagonistA's turn to enter the ring , ProtagonistA did so with a smile on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA rode ProtagonistA's horse around the course , jumping over the fences and doing ProtagonistA best to show off ProtagonistA's skills . When ProtagonistA crossed the finish line , ProtagonistA was met with applause from the crowd . ProtagonistA had done it ! ProtagonistA had placed first in the horse show . ProtagonistA was so excited and proud of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and Shining Armor for their support and went off to celebrate ProtagonistA's victory . 
.
ProtagonistA was sitting in the field of our estate , looking at a photograph of ProtagonistB , with the utmost circumstance of safety . ProtagonistA had been waiting for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had first heard about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been intrigued by the stories , and by the way ProtagonistB had looked in the photographs . Finally , ProtagonistA had been able to track ProtagonistB down , and ProtagonistA had been following ProtagonistB for days . ProtagonistA had been careful to keep ProtagonistA's distance , and to make sure that ProtagonistB never saw ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistA had been able to get close enough to take a few photographs . And now ProtagonistA was sitting in the field , looking at one of those photographs . ProtagonistB was a beautiful woman , with a kind face . ProtagonistA could see the intelligence in ProtagonistB's eyes , and the strength in ProtagonistB's jaw . ProtagonistB was a woman who had been through a lot , and who had come out the other side . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would be able to help ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's own problems . ProtagonistA just had to find a way to get close to ProtagonistB , and to get ProtagonistB to trust ProtagonistA . 
.
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the great grave , ignorant of all the history of the kingdom . ProtagonistA had no intention of ever going back . The only thing ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistA had been sent here by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA did n't know why , but ProtagonistA trusted ProtagonistB . After a while , ProtagonistA got up and dusted ProtagonistA off . ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was in a graveyard . ProtagonistA saw the headstones and remembered ProtagonistB's words .  All the history of the kingdom is buried here .  ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was sitting on the grave of the Queen of Hearts . 
.
ProtagonistB watched as ProtagonistA twisted and turned , ProtagonistA's hooves shifting as ProtagonistA tried to keep the position . ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was trying to find the perfect spot to lie down , but it just was n't happening . ProtagonistB felt bad for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB also knew that there was nothing ProtagonistB could do . ProtagonistB just had to wait it out and hope that ProtagonistA would eventually find a comfortable spot . 
.
ProtagonistA was born as the son of a salaried workman in the midst of a profusion of pre - war industries of industrial importance , and who , having hung on throughout a highly successful career , has made ProtagonistA's fortune by , and in fact made ProtagonistA's fortune quite a while ago , by the methods which ProtagonistA has adopted to capitalize upon ProtagonistA's great fortune , although of late the conflict of interest which ProtagonistB enjoyed , in procuring a certain amount of capital , has become a serious matter ProtagonistA was always a bright child , and ProtagonistA quickly learned how to capitalize on ProtagonistA's strengths . ProtagonistA was very good at making friends and networking , and ProtagonistA quickly learned how to use ProtagonistA's charms to get what ProtagonistA wanted . ProtagonistA was also very good at making money , and ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA could use ProtagonistA's money to get ahead in life . ProtagonistB was always very supportive of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA to get started in ProtagonistA's career . However , ProtagonistB was also very interested in making money , and ProtagonistB often used ProtagonistB's position to get ProtagonistA's help in making money . This conflict of interest eventually became a serious problem , and it caused a lot of tension between ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA is now a very successful woman , and ProtagonistA has made a fortune by using ProtagonistA's unique talents . However , ProtagonistA is still haunted by the conflict of interest with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA is often left wondering if ProtagonistA could have done more with ProtagonistA's life if ProtagonistA had not been so focused on making money . 
.
There was ProtagonistA in the full light of the morning , and ProtagonistA was very tired . ProtagonistA had been up all night , trying to finish ProtagonistA's homework , and ProtagonistA was just about to give up and go to bed when ProtagonistA heard a noise outside . It sounded like someone was crying . ProtagonistA went to the window and saw ProtagonistB sitting on the curb , crying ProtagonistB's eyes out . ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB had been there for a while . ProtagonistA felt bad for ProtagonistB , so ProtagonistA went outside to see if ProtagonistA could help . When ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistB was crying because ProtagonistB had lost ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistC's name was , and ProtagonistB said it was Mr. Whiskers . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistB did . They looked all around the neighborhood , but they could n't find ProtagonistC . Just when they were about to give up , ProtagonistA heard a meow coming from a tree . ProtagonistA climbed up the tree , and there was ProtagonistC , stuck in a branch . ProtagonistA got ProtagonistC down , and ProtagonistB was so happy to have ProtagonistC back . ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a big hug and went on ProtagonistB's way . ProtagonistA went back inside , and ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA had helped ProtagonistB . It made ProtagonistA feel good to know that ProtagonistA had made someone 's day a little bit better . 
.
ProtagonistA had never known that ProtagonistB did n't like ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had always thought that ProtagonistB was just a grumpy old man who did n't want to be bothered with ProtagonistA . But one day , ProtagonistA overheard ProtagonistB talking to ProtagonistA's mother .  ProtagonistB do n't know why you put up with ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA 's always been a troublemaker .  ProtagonistA's mother just sighed and said ,  ProtagonistA 's our daughter , and we love ProtagonistA .  After that , ProtagonistA tried to be a better daughter , but ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was being compared to ProtagonistA's siblings and found wanting . 
.
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a recluse , preferring to stay in ProtagonistA's workshop tinkering with ProtagonistA's latest invention rather than spend time with ProtagonistA's family . So , when ProtagonistB found out that ProtagonistA had been cheating on ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB was not surprised . What did surprise ProtagonistB was the lengths ProtagonistA went to keep ProtagonistA's affair a secret . ProtagonistA had been cheating on ProtagonistC with ProtagonistC's best friend . When ProtagonistB found out , ProtagonistB was devastated . ProtagonistB confronted ProtagonistA and demanded to know why ProtagonistA had done this to ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA's only response was that ProtagonistA was  in love  with ProtagonistB's friend . ProtagonistB was so angry that ProtagonistB tore ProtagonistA's arm off . ProtagonistB did n't even care that ProtagonistA was screaming in pain . All ProtagonistB cared about was the pain ProtagonistC was going through . ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistC would never be able to forgive ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB did n't blame ProtagonistC . As far as ProtagonistB was concerned , ProtagonistA was dead to ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistA had been taking the ferry down the winding stone steps into the harbor for years . ProtagonistA had never missed a day . But today , something was different . ProtagonistA could n't seem to get up . ProtagonistB , came over to ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA , please get up ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB ca n't leave without ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA tried to stand , but ProtagonistA's legs would n't work . ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA up and took ProtagonistA to the ferry . ProtagonistB sat ProtagonistA down and gave ProtagonistA a blanket .  What 's wrong , ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked .  ProtagonistA 've never been late before .  ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA did n't know what was wrong . ProtagonistA had been feeling tired lately , but ProtagonistA thought it was just because ProtagonistA was getting old . Now ProtagonistA was n't so sure . ProtagonistB stayed with ProtagonistA until the ferry arrived at the other side . Then ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA off and took ProtagonistA to the doctor . 
.
ProtagonistA watched in horror as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB die . ProtagonistA had seen death before , but never like this . ProtagonistB was being killed in cold blood , right in front of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could n't just stand by and watch . ProtagonistA had to do something . 
.
ProtagonistB would n't trust ProtagonistA , if only ProtagonistA were real . ProtagonistB 'd give ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's tongue , said the gleam of ProtagonistA's unicorn horn in ProtagonistB's pearly paling eyes . ProtagonistB had been following ProtagonistA for hours , it seemed , and ProtagonistB was getting tired . ProtagonistB had been so excited when ProtagonistB first saw ProtagonistA jump down the rabbit hole . ProtagonistB was sure that this was an adventure ProtagonistB would never forget . But now , ProtagonistB was n't so sure . ProtagonistA had led ProtagonistB to a strange place . There was a big house , and ProtagonistA had gone inside . ProtagonistB had tried to follow , but the door had slammed shut in ProtagonistB's face . ProtagonistB had been trying to find a way in ever since . ProtagonistB was just about to give up when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA again . ProtagonistA was sitting on a large mushroom , eating a carrot . ProtagonistB approached cautiously . ProtagonistB was n't sure if ProtagonistB could trust ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB was curious . ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  Where have ProtagonistA been ? ProtagonistB 've been looking for ProtagonistA . The rabbit did n't answer . ProtagonistA just continued to eat ProtagonistA's carrot . ProtagonistA , please ,  ProtagonistB begged .  ProtagonistB 'm lost . ProtagonistB do n't know where ProtagonistB am . Again , ProtagonistA said nothing . ProtagonistB was getting frustrated . ProtagonistB was about to give up when ProtagonistB saw the gleam in ProtagonistA's eye . It was the same gleam ProtagonistB had seen in the unicorn horn . ProtagonistA , if ProtagonistA 're real , then help ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB do n't know where ProtagonistB am . The rabbit hopped off the mushroom and led ProtagonistB to a door . ProtagonistA opened the door and motioned for ProtagonistB to go inside . ProtagonistB hesitated . ProtagonistB did n't know if ProtagonistB could trust ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistB was tired and lost , and ProtagonistB did n't know what else to do . ProtagonistB took a deep breath and stepped through the door . 
.
Slow , steady , and thoughtful , the moment ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's seat at the table , Equestrians moved through the dark and the undulating hall of the palace , picking vixens and lasses out of the crowd and casting them away to dance with the three most beautiful sisters of the Siras Academy . ProtagonistA , feeling a sudden warmth in ProtagonistA's cheeks , turned ProtagonistA's head away from the Equestrians . ProtagonistA caught the eye of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had a kind face and a warm smile , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart flutter in ProtagonistA's chest . The music started up , a slow , sensual melody that made ProtagonistA's skin prick with goosebumps . The Equestrians began to move , their hips undulating in time with the music . ProtagonistA watched , entranced , as they moved around the room , their bodies graceful and powerful . Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt a hand on ProtagonistA's shoulder , and ProtagonistA was being pulled to ProtagonistA's feet . ProtagonistA looked up into the eyes of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA's hand and led ProtagonistA onto the dance floor . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream as ProtagonistA was swept up in the music and the movement . ProtagonistA was lost in the moment , and ProtagonistA did n't want it to end . 
.
It was a cold , winter morning and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were walking to school . ProtagonistB was carrying ProtagonistA's heavy backpack for ProtagonistA . They were two blocks from the school door and three blocks from the flat that always seemed to be the last place to put ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA went to sleep . ProtagonistB was tired and ProtagonistA's daughter could see it in ProtagonistB's eyes .  ProtagonistB , can ProtagonistA walk the rest of the way by ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistA asked .  ProtagonistB think ProtagonistA should ,  ProtagonistB replied . So ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's backpack and continued on to school by ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was cold , but ProtagonistA felt good walking on ProtagonistA's own . 
.
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA saw a light up ahead . ProtagonistA walked towards it and saw that it was a lamp on a small table . ProtagonistA picked it up and looked around . ProtagonistA saw a door in the tree and a key on the table . ProtagonistA put the key in the door and turned it . The door opened and ProtagonistA walked through . ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden . The flowers were glittering with the colors of magic . ProtagonistA blinked widely , as though ProtagonistA were trying to find the light . ProtagonistA walked around the garden and saw a castle in the distance . ProtagonistA started to walk towards it , but ProtagonistA was suddenly pulled back . ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB standing there . ProtagonistB was holding a lantern and ProtagonistB looked very old .  Who are ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked .  ProtagonistB am the keeper of this garden ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB have been waiting for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB have been waiting for a very long time .  
.
ProtagonistA was a young woman who lived in a small town . ProtagonistA was a simple girl who worked hard and did n't have much . One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the woods when ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was very old and looked like ProtagonistB was about to die . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was the Emperor of the Day , and according to the law of physics , ProtagonistB was going to die in the year 5802 . ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA the title of Emperor , and this made ProtagonistA powerful . ProtagonistA was now able to make deals with anyone ProtagonistA wanted . ProtagonistA quickly became the most powerful person in the world . 
.
ProtagonistA was walking home from the back of the church , where ProtagonistA had been having a rough passage due to ProtagonistA , and which was in ProtagonistA's own shoes , with ProtagonistA's hat on . ProtagonistA was thinking about the events of the day and how ProtagonistA could have handled them better . ProtagonistA was also thinking about the future and what ProtagonistA wanted to do with ProtagonistA's life . As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB walking in front of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase . ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was going somewhere important . ProtagonistA wondered what ProtagonistB did for a living . ProtagonistA also wondered if ProtagonistB had ever had a rough passage in ProtagonistB's life . 
.
ProtagonistB had been battling ovarian cancer for years , and ProtagonistA had been by ProtagonistB's side every step of the way . But the cancer had finally taken ProtagonistB's life , and ProtagonistA was left feeling lost and alone . The night after ProtagonistB's death , ProtagonistA spent the night in a hospital room with a needle in ProtagonistA's arm and a tube in ProtagonistA's leg . And it was during that night that ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's first dream . In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing in a field of flowers . ProtagonistB was smiling and ProtagonistB looked happy and at peace . ProtagonistA woke up from ProtagonistA's dream feeling comforted and hopeful . Even though ProtagonistB was gone , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was still with ProtagonistB in spirit . 
.
ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA back on the landscape and ProtagonistB said ,  That 's it , then . ProtagonistA 's free , though ProtagonistA doubts it . Even an assassination attempt in the capital would be unlikely . Oh , ProtagonistB know it 's a bad idea . ProtagonistA was at a party once . ProtagonistA sighed and shook ProtagonistA's head .  ProtagonistA do n't know , ProtagonistB . It just seems so final , you know ? Like ProtagonistA 'm giving up on everything . ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 're not giving up on anything . ProtagonistA 're just moving on to the next phase of ProtagonistA's life . And besides , ProtagonistA know it 's the right thing to do . ProtagonistA 've been talking about it for months now . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was right , but ProtagonistA still could n't help but feel a little sad as ProtagonistA turned away from ProtagonistA's home of the last ten years . ProtagonistA had loved living in the city , but it was time for a change . And ProtagonistA was ready for the next adventure . 
.
It is a month of extreme hardship for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA can not possibly be surprised by the scene which I have set before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB's body is lying in state in the great hall of the castle , and ProtagonistA is weeping over it . All of ProtagonistB's belongings have been taken away , and ProtagonistA is the only one who has been left to mourn ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA is not surprised by the scene , but ProtagonistA is saddened by it . 
.
ProtagonistA had always been good at cards . ProtagonistA could remember back to when ProtagonistA was a little girl , sitting at the kitchen table with ProtagonistA's mother and father , playing Go Fish and War . ProtagonistA had always had a knack for reading people and knowing what cards they were holding . As ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA could use ProtagonistA's skills to make money . So , some time in the latter half of the eighteenth century , ProtagonistA set out to steal the title of Ruben de Vros , notwithstanding the great advantages which ProtagonistA had acquired by ProtagonistA's skill in the art of card - playing . ProtagonistA went to the best casinos in Europe and cleaned them out , one by one . The owners of the casinos got wind of who ProtagonistA was and started banning ProtagonistA from their establishments . But ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA was on a roll and nothing was going to stop ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA started playing in underground games , where the stakes were higher and the players were more desperate . ProtagonistA won more money than ProtagonistA knew what to do with and rubbed elbows with the criminal underworld . But ProtagonistA's luck eventually ran out . One night , ProtagonistA was playing in a high - stakes game with some of the most dangerous people in the world . ProtagonistA lost everything ProtagonistA had and then some . Desperate and broke , ProtagonistA made a deal with ProtagonistB to give ProtagonistB information on other card players in exchange for money . It was a slippery slope from there . ProtagonistA became a professional gambler and a con artist , using ProtagonistA's skills to take advantage of other people . ProtagonistA ruined lives and ruined ProtagonistA in the process . ProtagonistA ended up alone and penniless , ProtagonistA's once - great skills nothing but a memory . 
.
ProtagonistA , sitting crosslegged on a damp stone floor , had a cigarette lighter in each hand , and a bundle of twigs in front of ProtagonistA , containing nothing but a wide - brimmed hat and a pair of straw gloves . ProtagonistA was trying to light a fire , but the dampness of the twigs made it difficult . ProtagonistA had been at it for hours , and ProtagonistA's fingers were getting sore from holding the lighters . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw a spark catch on one of the twigs . ProtagonistA quickly cupped ProtagonistA's hands around it to shelter it from the damp air , and soon a small fire was burning . ProtagonistA added some of the larger twigs to the fire , and then sat back to warm ProtagonistA's hands . ProtagonistA was so focused on the fire that ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching until they were right behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistB standing there , watching ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't know how long ProtagonistB had been there , but ProtagonistA did n't feel scared . There was something about ProtagonistB's presence that was comforting . ProtagonistB sat down next to ProtagonistA and they watched the fire together in silence . 
.
ProtagonistA's eighteenth year was the best year of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB , and they went on the most amazing honeymoon . They traveled all over the world , and they had the time of their lives . Every day was a new adventure , and they just could n't get enough of each other . They were truly in love . However , all good things must come to an end , and eventually they had to return home . They were both sad to leave their magical honeymoon behind , but they knew that they had to get back to reality . Even though they 're no longer on their honeymoon , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB's 's love for each other is stronger than ever . They cherish all of the memories they made on their honeymoon , and they know that they 'll never forget it . It was truly the best year of their lives . 
.
In the year of our Lord 2001 , ProtagonistA was sitting in the chair , with ProtagonistA's hat on the mantelpiece , and ProtagonistB next to ProtagonistA , which was a very strange arrangement . ProtagonistB had a top hat of ProtagonistB's own , which ProtagonistB was holding in ProtagonistB's hands . ProtagonistB was looking at ProtagonistA with a strange expression on ProtagonistB's face . What are ProtagonistB looking at ?  ProtagonistA asked . I'm looking at ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA 're a very strange woman . And ProtagonistB 're a very strange man ,  ProtagonistA said .  Why are ProtagonistB here?I'm here to help ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA 're in a lot of trouble . What kind of trouble ?  ProtagonistA asked . You're in danger ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA need to leave this place . Why ?  ProtagonistA asked .  What 's going to happen to me?I ca n't tell ProtagonistA that ,  ProtagonistB said .  But ProtagonistA need to trust ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA need to come with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment . ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA could trust ProtagonistB . But then ProtagonistA thought about all the trouble ProtagonistA was in . ProtagonistA was in danger . ProtagonistA needed to leave . ProtagonistA stood up and followed ProtagonistB out of the house . ProtagonistA did n't know what was going to happen , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to trust ProtagonistB . 
.
 Well ProtagonistB 've done well indeed ,  said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA sat down next to ProtagonistB , looking up at the heavens above them with a kind of dislike and a kind of curiosity .  ProtagonistB 've managed to find the only spot on this entire planet that is n't covered in pollution . I know ,  said ProtagonistB ,  but it was n't easy . It took ProtagonistB years to find this place . And now that ProtagonistB have , what are ProtagonistB going to do with it?I'm going to live here ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'm going to build a house and live off the land . You're going to be lonely ,  ProtagonistA said . No , ProtagonistB 'm not ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'm going to be happy .  
.
ProtagonistA was a paralegal at a small law firm and ProtagonistA was given a file to examine . The file was for a divorce case and ProtagonistA was supposed to find any assets that the husband may have hidden from the wife . ProtagonistA looked through the file and found a bank statement from a hidden bank account . ProtagonistA also found a document showing that the husband had purchased a life insurance policy with his wife as the beneficiary . ProtagonistA brought these findings to ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB was able to use them to get a better settlement for the wife . 
.
As ProtagonistA stood at ProtagonistA's office door , waiting to be summoned , ProtagonistA noticed that the door was open . ProtagonistA peered inside and saw ProtagonistB , sitting at ProtagonistB's desk . ProtagonistA was about to knock on the door when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB speaking on the phone .  ProtagonistB 'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but we 're going to have to let ProtagonistA go . We just ca n't afford to keep ProtagonistA on any longer .  ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart sink as ProtagonistA heard the words . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had been with the company for a long time and that ProtagonistA was a good worker . ProtagonistA did n't deserve to be treated like this . ProtagonistA was about to turn and leave when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB say ,  ProtagonistA , come in .  ProtagonistA walked into the office and sat down in the chair across from ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB 'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB 'm going to have to let ProtagonistA go , too . We just ca n't afford to keep ProtagonistA on any longer .  ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's eyes fill with tears as ProtagonistA heard the words . ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do . ProtagonistA had been with the company for five years and this was the first time ProtagonistA had ever been let go from a job . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to support ProtagonistA's family . 
.
ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way through the city , noticing the strange looks ProtagonistA got from the people around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew they were wondering why ProtagonistA was there , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to make a good impression . ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way to ProtagonistB's office , and ProtagonistA made a noticeable effort to be friendly , although ProtagonistA knew well enough from ProtagonistA's long experience in the city that the term seemed more than a little strange to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB , looked at ProtagonistA with a confused expression .  Can ProtagonistB help ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked .  ProtagonistA need a runner ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistB 'm sorry , we do n't offer that service ,  ProtagonistB said .  But ProtagonistB can give ProtagonistA a list of people who might be able to help ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and took the list . ProtagonistA was determined to find a runner who could help ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA would find one on the list .

ProtagonistA wanted them to be able to make their own decisions , and ProtagonistA wanted them to be able to think for themselves . ProtagonistA's story is an inspirational one , and it shows that it is never too late to learn . ProtagonistA is an example of a strong and independent woman , and ProtagonistA is an example to all women who want to make a difference in the world . 
.
 It 's a pity to see ProtagonistA's head , ProtagonistA's wife , all throbbing and squirmy , ProtagonistA's eyes so half - closed ,  said ProtagonistB in ProtagonistB's sweetest voice .  ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA not to drink so much wine , but ProtagonistA would n't listen to ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA's head was indeed throbbing and squirmy , and ProtagonistA's eyes were only half - open . ProtagonistA tried to speak , but ProtagonistA's words were slurred and incomprehensible .  ProtagonistA 'm so sorry , ProtagonistA's love ,  ProtagonistA said finally .  Please forgive ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head and walked away , leaving ProtagonistA alone with ProtagonistA's throbbing head and squirming stomach . 
.
ProtagonistA had finally decided to carve a story for ProtagonistB . It had been two years since ProtagonistB's death , and ProtagonistA felt it was time to tell their story . ProtagonistA began carving into the wood , telling the story of how they met , their life together , and how ProtagonistB's death had affected ProtagonistA . As ProtagonistA carved , ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistB's presence with ProtagonistA , and it brought ProtagonistA's comfort . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was listening , and that ProtagonistB would always be with ProtagonistA . 
.
In truth , for all the things ProtagonistA had , no one expected ProtagonistA to be a mother . ProtagonistA was always so independent and carefree . But when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , everything changed . ProtagonistA suddenly saw the potential for a life with ProtagonistB - a life with love and laughter and happiness . And when they found out they were expecting a baby , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was ready to be a mother . ProtagonistA was ready to give ProtagonistA's child everything ProtagonistA never had . ProtagonistA was ready to love unconditionally . 
.
ProtagonistA was in a deep sleep when ProtagonistA heard the words  ProtagonistB is dead .  ProtagonistA slowly opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw ProtagonistB's dead body next to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA started to scream as ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was going to be next . 
.
The first time ProtagonistB pulled ProtagonistA out of the park , ProtagonistA was in a tangle of newts , ProtagonistA's body in full view of the other newts . ProtagonistA was embarrassed and tried to cover ProtagonistA up , but ProtagonistB just laughed and said ProtagonistA was beautiful . ProtagonistA blushed and looked down , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel flattered . 
.
The air in the room in which ProtagonistA , before every other girl in ProtagonistA's family , had been married , was of a clear , clear water , free from the mists of the night . It was a room that had been in ProtagonistA's family for generations , and it was said that the air in that room had the power to bring good luck to those who were married in it . And so , on that fateful day , ProtagonistA became the latest in a long line of brides to be married in that room . ProtagonistA could feel the weight of history on ProtagonistA's shoulders as ProtagonistA walked down the aisle , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would be creating new memories for ProtagonistA's own children and grandchildren to look back on one day . As ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's hand and pledged ProtagonistA's life to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and contentment settle over ProtagonistA . This was ProtagonistA's home , and this was where ProtagonistA belonged . 
.
ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB for the first time when ProtagonistA was eleven years old . ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB was really cute , but was too shy to say anything . They ended up becoming good friends and would often talk and hang out together . When ProtagonistA turned eighteen , ProtagonistA finally mustered up the courage to tell ProtagonistB how ProtagonistA felt about ProtagonistB . It turns out , ProtagonistB felt the same way about ProtagonistA and they ended up dating . They 've been together for five years now and are very happy . 
.
ProtagonistA never knew the difference between December and any other month . To ProtagonistA , they were all the same . ProtagonistA would go to church every Sunday , sit in the same pew , and sing the same songs . ProtagonistA never complained , because ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life . One day , ProtagonistA went to church and saw that the pews were empty . ProtagonistA thought that maybe everyone was just late , so ProtagonistA sat down and waited . After a few minutes , ProtagonistA realized that no one was coming . ProtagonistA got up and walked to the front of the church , where ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB packing up ProtagonistB's things . Father , where is everyone ?  ProtagonistA asked . I'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but there is no one here . The parish has been closed down . ProtagonistA was confused . ProtagonistA did n't understand what was happening . ProtagonistA had been coming to this church ProtagonistA's whole life , and now it was gone . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could come and live with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA never forgot the church that ProtagonistA loved , but ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's new life . 
.
ProtagonistA stood before ProtagonistB , and the breath was stilled before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it . ProtagonistB was huge ! ProtagonistB's muscles rippled under ProtagonistB's skin , and ProtagonistB's eyes burned with a fierce intensity . ProtagonistA could feel the power emanating from ProtagonistB , and it was both exhilarating and terrifying . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB could crush ProtagonistA like a grape if ProtagonistB wanted to , and the thought made ProtagonistA's heart race . But ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistB would never hurt ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA could see the gentleness in ProtagonistB's eyes , and the way ProtagonistB's whole body was relaxed . ProtagonistB was like a lion who had been tamed , and ProtagonistA felt safe in ProtagonistB's presence . They stared at each other for a long moment , and then ProtagonistB spoke . ProtagonistB have been waiting for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistA would come . ProtagonistB voice was like thunder , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's knees tremble . But ProtagonistA stood ProtagonistA's ground and met ProtagonistB's gaze . Who are ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked . ProtagonistB am the Guardian of this place . It is ProtagonistB's duty to protect those who enter . And why do ProtagonistB need to protect me?Because ProtagonistA are special , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA have a destiny to fulfill . ProtagonistA did n't know what to say to that , so ProtagonistA just stood there and looked at ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA must be tired after ProtagonistA's journey . Come , sit down and rest . ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA to a nearby tree and ProtagonistA sat down . ProtagonistB sat down next to ProtagonistA and they looked at each other for a long time . Finally , ProtagonistA spoke . Thank ProtagonistB for protecting ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA do n't know what ProtagonistA's destiny is , but ProtagonistA will trust ProtagonistB . And with that , ProtagonistA fell into a deep sleep . 
.
Fourteen years ago , when ProtagonistA was conducting ProtagonistA's last examination of ProtagonistA's patients , ProtagonistA had an idea of what might befall ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was not sure what it was , but ProtagonistA knew it would be something terrible . And so it was . ProtagonistB was found dead in ProtagonistB's bed , with ProtagonistB's eyes wide open and a look of terror on ProtagonistB's face . It is said that ProtagonistA knew what would happen , and ProtagonistA tried to warn ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB would not listen . 
.
There was once ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always very adventurous , and loved to explore the world around ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB . Without hesitation , ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB down a rabbit hole , and found ProtagonistA in a place ProtagonistA had never seen before . ProtagonistA was amazed by all the new sights and sounds , and could n't wait to explore more of this new world . 
.
It was about that day that ProtagonistA finally said goodbye to ProtagonistB and child . ProtagonistA had been planning to do it for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had found out that ProtagonistB had been cheating on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had packed ProtagonistA's bags and made all the arrangements , and now all ProtagonistA had to do was say the words . ProtagonistA walked into the living room where ProtagonistB and child were watching TV and sat down next to them . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and said ,  ProtagonistA 'm leaving you . ProtagonistA 'm taking the child with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was stunned . ProtagonistB could n't believe that ProtagonistA was really doing this . ProtagonistB begged ProtagonistA to stay , but ProtagonistA was resolute . ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things and ProtagonistA's child 's things and left the house . It was a difficult decision , but ProtagonistA knew it was the right thing to do . ProtagonistA was finally free from ProtagonistA's unhappy marriage and could start fresh with ProtagonistA's child . 
.
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with big , blue eyes and ProtagonistA felt a sudden surge of maternal instinct . ProtagonistA scooped ProtagonistB up and took ProtagonistB home , despite the protests of ProtagonistA's husband . They named ProtagonistB Stripes and ProtagonistB quickly became a part of the family . ProtagonistB looked so much like ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA's husband often joked that ProtagonistB was really ProtagonistA's son . As ProtagonistB grew , ProtagonistB began to look more and more like a man . By the time ProtagonistB was five inches tall , ProtagonistB looked exactly like ProtagonistA's husband . This caused some tension in the family , but they all loved ProtagonistB and accepted ProtagonistB as one of their own . One day , when ProtagonistB was five inches long , ProtagonistB ran away from home . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's husband searched for ProtagonistB for days , but they never found ProtagonistB . They always wondered what happened to ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistA has been a part of our lives for as long as we can remember . ProtagonistA 's been in every picture book , every movie , and every TV show . We all know ProtagonistA's story by heart . But how did ProtagonistA come to be?No one knows for sure , but the most popular theory is that ProtagonistA was created by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a mathematician and a writer , and ProtagonistB was fascinated by children . ProtagonistB would often take them on boat rides and tell them stories . One day , ProtagonistB told a story about ProtagonistA . The children loved it so much that they begged ProtagonistB to write it down . And so ProtagonistB did . The picture of ProtagonistA that we all know and love was drawn by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB wanted to make sure that ProtagonistA looked exactly like the children ProtagonistB had told the story to . ProtagonistA has been a part of our lives for over 150 years now . ProtagonistA has been through all sorts of adventures , and ProtagonistA always manages to come out on top . ProtagonistA is a symbol of hope and resilience , and we will always love ProtagonistA . 
.
ProtagonistA was going to have to kill ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA said , sitting on the arm of the chair and looking into ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly , but ProtagonistA could n't let ProtagonistB live knowing what ProtagonistA knew . It was better for ProtagonistB to die now , before it was too late . 
.
ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's early twenty - first year , had , in fact , the least to do , of all ProtagonistB's ladies of ProtagonistA's age , in the establishment of a palace for them at the point where the river Styx flows into the Thrym - yard . The other ladies , all older and more experienced , took charge of the construction , while ProtagonistA was given the task of supervising the servants and making sure the palace ran smoothly . ProtagonistA did n't mind , though ; ProtagonistA was happy to have a place in ProtagonistB's court , and ProtagonistA enjoyed the challenge of keeping everything running smoothly . One day , ProtagonistA was walking through the palace grounds when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the river . ProtagonistA went to investigate and saw a beautiful golden fish swimming upstream . It was struggling against the current , and ProtagonistA could see that it was exhausted . ProtagonistA quickly scooped it up in ProtagonistA's net and brought it to the palace , where ProtagonistA put it in a tank of fresh water . The fish was so grateful to ProtagonistA for saving its life , and it soon became clear that it had magical powers . It granted ProtagonistA three wishes , and ProtagonistA used them wisely . First , ProtagonistA wished for the palace to be finished so that ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's ladies would have a comfortable home . Second , ProtagonistA wished for the servants to be well - trained and efficient , so that the palace would run like a well - oiled machine . And third , ProtagonistA wished for a never - ending supply of fresh fish for the tank . The fish 's magical powers had transformed the palace into a beautiful and luxurious home , and ProtagonistA was proud to have played a part in it . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's ladies would be happy there for many years to come . 
.
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB lived along the southern shore of an old lake in one of the smaller coves . ProtagonistA bore a very infamous , rather sordid remembrance of ProtagonistB . One day , while out walking along the shore , ProtagonistA came across a dead body . The body was that of ProtagonistB . There was a note next to the body that said  ProtagonistB 'm sorry  . 
.
ProtagonistA had always been a bright girl , and ProtagonistA's parents had high hopes for ProtagonistA's future . So when ProtagonistA was accepted into a prestigious boarding school , they were over the moon . ProtagonistA was excited to leave ProtagonistA's small town and start a new chapter in ProtagonistA's life . But ProtagonistA had a secret . ProtagonistA was gifted with a special ability - ProtagonistA could see into the future . ProtagonistA had never told anyone about ProtagonistA's gift , for fear of being labelled a freak . But ProtagonistA knew that there was someone out there who would be interested in ProtagonistA's ability - ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was nervous about meeting ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that it was inevitable . One day , ProtagonistA would have to face ProtagonistB and reveal ProtagonistA's secret . Until then , ProtagonistA would keep ProtagonistA's ability hidden and enjoy ProtagonistA's time at boarding school . 
.
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were having lunch at the upper end of the city . It was a beautiful day , and they were enjoying the view of the skyline . ProtagonistB commented on how lucky ProtagonistA was to live in such a beautiful city . ProtagonistA agreed , but said that ProtagonistA sometimes felt like a fish out of water . ProtagonistA missed the small - town feel of ProtagonistA's hometown . ProtagonistB sympathized , but said that ProtagonistB thought the city was exciting and full of opportunity . ProtagonistA nodded , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little homesick . 
.
Ever since the dark nights of the past , when ProtagonistA had been orphan and immature , and brought to the surface of madness by the combination of innocence with evil , the beautiful , innocent face of ProtagonistA , had been a source of terror to ProtagonistB , and perhaps to ProtagonistA , and one of the most uncertain and troublesome situations of childhood . ProtagonistB had never known what to do with that face , how to protect ProtagonistA from the dangers that it seemed to attract . And so ProtagonistB had always been on ProtagonistB's guard , never letting ProtagonistA out of ProtagonistB's sight for a moment , and never letting ProtagonistA out of the house after dark . But now , ProtagonistA was grown up , and ProtagonistB was no longer with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's own in the world , and ProtagonistA had to face ProtagonistA's fears head on . ProtagonistA had to learn to control the darkness that seemed to well up inside ProtagonistA whenever ProtagonistA thought of those nights long ago . Slowly , ProtagonistA began to venture out after dark , and to ProtagonistA's surprise , nothing happened . The darkness did n't consume ProtagonistA , and the monsters did n't come to get ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA began to feel more confident , and ProtagonistA's green eyes no longer seemed to hold the same terror for ProtagonistA . Eventually , ProtagonistA came to accept that the darkness was a part of ProtagonistA , but it did n't have to control ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was in control now , and ProtagonistA could choose to face the darkness or to turn away from it . ProtagonistA was no longer a scared little girl , and ProtagonistA was no longer alone . 
.
ProtagonistB had not expected to find ProtagonistA dead . ProtagonistB had been walking in the woods , looking for mushrooms , when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA's body lying on the ground . ProtagonistA was lying on ProtagonistA's back , ProtagonistA's eyes open and staring up at the sky . There was no blood , no signs of violence . It looked as if ProtagonistA had simply lain down and died . ProtagonistB called the police and then sat down to wait . ProtagonistB was in shock , and it was n't until the police arrived that ProtagonistB realized ProtagonistB had been crying . 
.
ProtagonistA had once left a large sum of money and ProtagonistA's house in London for the purpose of making a new life for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had wanted a man who would be faithful to ProtagonistA in the world . ProtagonistA had met many men , but none of them had been the right one . ProtagonistA had almost given up hope , when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was everything ProtagonistA had ever wanted in a man , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be faithful to ProtagonistA . They got married and moved to a small town in the middle of nowhere . It was perfect . They had a beautiful house and a wonderful life . Everything was perfect , until ProtagonistB started cheating on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA had given up everything for ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB had betrayed ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA left ProtagonistB and moved back to London . ProtagonistA never wanted to see ProtagonistB again . 
.
The night ProtagonistA vanished was the night when ProtagonistA shared ProtagonistA's bed with ProtagonistB . It was also the night when ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistB was a vampire . ProtagonistA had always suspected that ProtagonistB was something otherworldly , but ProtagonistA never could have guessed that ProtagonistB was a bloodsucking fiend . When ProtagonistA confronted ProtagonistB about it , ProtagonistB did n't deny it . In fact , ProtagonistB seemed almost proud of it . That 's when ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get away from ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and snuck out while ProtagonistB was sleeping . ProtagonistA 's never looked back since . 
.
The last time they saw each other , ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's seventh year . It was a cold day and ProtagonistA was bundled up in ProtagonistA's coat , scarf , and gloves . ProtagonistA had just finished ProtagonistA's shift at the factory and was on ProtagonistA's way home when ProtagonistA saw a group of kids playing in the snow . ProtagonistB , was trying to build a snowman but was having trouble . ProtagonistA stopped to help ProtagonistB , and when ProtagonistA was done , ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a big hug . That was the last time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA never forgot that day , and every year on the anniversary of it , ProtagonistA would go back to that same spot and build a snowman with ProtagonistB . Even when ProtagonistB was no longer a little girl ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB would still come to visit ProtagonistA and help ProtagonistA build the snowman . And every year , they would give each other a big hug . 
.
ProtagonistA came to my house on Tuesday to tell me the news that ProtagonistB had been admitted into the College of the Holy McPherson Priory . ProtagonistA said that it would be five years before ProtagonistB would be able to see ProtagonistB's aunt . I was very happy for ProtagonistB and I knew that ProtagonistB would be able to get a good education at the college . 
.
ProtagonistA was in the kitchen about that time , knitting a scarf for ProtagonistB , when ProtagonistA noticed a shadow sitting on the table . It was a small shadow , about the size of a mouse , and it had a curious look on its face . ProtagonistA had never seen a shadow like this before , and ProtagonistA was wondering what it was doing in ProtagonistA's kitchen . The shadow seemed to be looking around the kitchen , as if it were looking for something . After a few minutes , it got up from the table and started to explore the rest of the room . ProtagonistA watched it for a while , but ProtagonistA soon got back to ProtagonistA's knitting . A few minutes later , ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the living room . It sounded like something was knocking over furniture . ProtagonistA got up to see what was going on and found the shadow in the living room , knocking over a lamp . Hey ! What are you doing ?  ProtagonistA exclaimed . The shadow turned to look at ProtagonistA and then ran out the door . ProtagonistA chased it , but it was too fast for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA lost sight of it and it was gone . ProtagonistA was bewildered by what had just happened . ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it before . ProtagonistA was about to go back to the living room to clean up the mess when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB coming home . ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm home !  ProtagonistB called out . I'm in the kitchen !  ProtagonistA replied . ProtagonistA quickly finished knitting the scarf and went to meet ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA did n't mention the shadow to ProtagonistB , as ProtagonistA was n't sure what to make of it . Maybe it was just a strange coincidence and ProtagonistA would never see it again . 
.
ProtagonistA's husband had died eight days ago , and ProtagonistA was still in mourning . ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's parlor , chatting with ProtagonistA's neighbor , when ProtagonistA suddenly remembered that ProtagonistA had to choose a subject of conversation for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA decided to ask ProtagonistB about the world 's greatest chocolate connoisseur of the nineteenth century , Mr. Belvedere of the Parisian street fly - and - supplies , Dr. John Quartermaster - of - the - ship - whale Squadron Heterozone of the Navy , and indeed the world - famous spectacles - in - the - air . Just as ProtagonistA was about to begin ProtagonistA's inquiry , ProtagonistA heard a loud banging on ProtagonistA's door . ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and found ProtagonistC standing there , brandishing a revolver . ProtagonistC shouted at ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC am coming to murder ProtagonistA ! Go away , ProtagonistA was terrified . ProtagonistA slammed the door shut and ran to the nearest telephone to call the police . When they arrived , they found ProtagonistC still outside , ranting and raving . They took ProtagonistC away and ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief . 
.
ProtagonistA had just moved to a new town and was starting ProtagonistA's first day of school . ProtagonistA was feeling nervous and out of place when ProtagonistA saw a group of kids laughing and pointing at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA tried to ignore them , but ProtagonistA could feel the tears welling up in ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA was about to turn and run away when ProtagonistA heard someone call ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as Harry and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would be ProtagonistA's friend . From that day forward , ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA laugh when ProtagonistA was feeling down and helped ProtagonistA adjust to ProtagonistA's new life . ProtagonistA will always be grateful to ProtagonistB for being ProtagonistA's friend when ProtagonistA needed it most . 
.
ProtagonistA was getting fed up with ProtagonistB constantly calling ProtagonistA  Madam .  ProtagonistA knew it was meant as a term of respect , but it made ProtagonistA feel old and stuffy . Finally , ProtagonistA decided to say something . ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would appreciate it if ProtagonistB would stop calling ProtagonistA ' Madam . ' It makes ProtagonistA feel like an old lady . ProtagonistA aunt was taken aback at first , but then ProtagonistB realized how ProtagonistA must feel . Of course , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB 'm sorry if ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA feel uncomfortable . ProtagonistB 'll try to remember to call ProtagonistA by ProtagonistA's name from now on .  
.
ProtagonistA flung open the white door of ProtagonistA's kitchen and directed the astonished man in the line to the dining room . ProtagonistA had been expecting ProtagonistB all day and was not going to let ProtagonistB get away this time . ProtagonistA had been tracking ProtagonistB's every move and knew that ProtagonistB would be coming to ProtagonistA's house . ProtagonistA was not going to let ProtagonistB get away with what ProtagonistB had done . 
.
ProtagonistA was a young woman who knew what ProtagonistA wanted in life , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to get it . ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer , and ProtagonistA wanted to be a writer . ProtagonistA had read all the great classics and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could write something just as good , if not better . But ProtagonistA did n't know how to get started . ProtagonistA did n't have any ideas for stories , and ProtagonistA did n't know how to go about getting published . One day , ProtagonistA was walking in the park and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on a bench , writing in a notebook . ProtagonistA went up to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB was writing . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was a writer and that ProtagonistB was working on ProtagonistB's latest novel . ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA was a writer too , and ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that if ProtagonistA wanted to be a writer , ProtagonistA should just start writing . It was that simple . ProtagonistA went home and started writing ProtagonistA's first story . ProtagonistA was a little unsure at first , but ProtagonistA kept going and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA's rhythm . ProtagonistA wrote and wrote until ProtagonistA had a complete story . Then ProtagonistA sent it off to a publisher . ProtagonistA was so excited when ProtagonistA got a letter back saying that they wanted to publish ProtagonistA's story . ProtagonistA was finally a published author . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA wanted to be a writer , and ProtagonistA finally achieved ProtagonistA's dream . 
.
ProtagonistA was a stranger , and a stranger that ProtagonistA was , if ProtagonistA had been anything like any other woman of flesh or blood . ProtagonistA was different than any other woman that ProtagonistB had ever met . ProtagonistA was beautiful and intriguing , and ProtagonistB could n't help but be drawn to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB wanted to know more about ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB was determined to find out . ProtagonistB would do whatever it took to get to know ProtagonistA better . 
.
It was a warm day in early June when ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB said their vows . They were surrounded by their closest family and friends , all of whom were beaming with happiness . It was a perfect day . Three months later , ProtagonistA was dead . The cause of death was a complication of pregnancy - something that no one could have predicted or prevented . ProtagonistA had only been married for a short time , but in that time ProtagonistA had been incredibly happy . ProtagonistA's death came as a shock to everyone who knew ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was devastated . ProtagonistB could n't believe that ProtagonistA was gone , and that ProtagonistB would never see ProtagonistA again . The pain was unbearable . ProtagonistA's family and friends were also grieving . They could n't believe that ProtagonistA was gone so soon . It was a tragic event , but everyone who loved ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never be forgotten . 
.
ProtagonistA was born in a house where the gods took their name from ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistC from the earth . It was a happy home , full of laughter and love . But when ProtagonistA's father died , everything changed . ProtagonistB became a bitter woman , and ProtagonistB began to take ProtagonistB's anger out on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB would beat ProtagonistA and call ProtagonistA's names , making ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistA was nothing . But ProtagonistA was a strong girl , and ProtagonistA refused to let ProtagonistB break ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was named after the gods , and that made ProtagonistA special . And ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistC was named after the earth , and that made ProtagonistC special too . So ProtagonistA held onto ProtagonistA's memories of ProtagonistA's happy childhood , and ProtagonistA used them to keep ProtagonistA going . Even though ProtagonistA's life was hard , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could make it through anything . 
.
Nearly two hours after ProtagonistA had set out on ProtagonistA's journey to the far - away city of St. Louis , ProtagonistA arrived at the eastern gate of the town . ProtagonistA was relieved to have made it this far , but ProtagonistA's journey was far from over . ProtagonistA still had to find a place to stay for the night and figure out how to get to ProtagonistA's destination . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB for directions to the nearest inn , and ProtagonistB pointed ProtagonistA in the right direction . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and set off down the street . As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA passed by many shops and homes , all of which were bustling with activity . ProtagonistA had never seen a town this big before , and ProtagonistA was feeling a bit overwhelmed . ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistB yell after ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA turned around and saw that ProtagonistB was pointing at a large sign that read  No Entry after Sunset .  ProtagonistA had forgotten all about the curfew ! ProtagonistA quickly thanked ProtagonistB again and rushed to the inn , hoping ProtagonistA would make it there before the curfew . 
.
ProtagonistA was a good and kind woman , and as such ProtagonistA would not have anything to do with a sick man . ProtagonistA was content to live a life of solitude , only interacting with others when absolutely necessary . ProtagonistA's only companions were the books ProtagonistA read and the animals ProtagonistA cared for . One day , however , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA's door , begging for help . ProtagonistA hesitated , but ProtagonistA's kind heart won out and ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB in . ProtagonistA nursed ProtagonistB back to health , and in the process , fell in love with ProtagonistB . They were married a year later , and lived happily ever after . ProtagonistA learned that sometimes the best things in life come from those we least expect it .

.
ProtagonistA was always fascinated by magic . As a child , ProtagonistA would watch ProtagonistA's favorite wizards perform on TV and ProtagonistA would dream of being a wizard ProtagonistA one day . ProtagonistA's childhood was poor , however , and ProtagonistA never had the opportunity to learn magic . One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA under ProtagonistB's wing and taught ProtagonistA everything ProtagonistA needed to know about magic . Now , ProtagonistA is a wizard ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA uses ProtagonistA's powers to help others . 
.
In ProtagonistA's youth , ProtagonistA was very much interested in things which interested ProtagonistB ; and ProtagonistA was but too happy to indulge in any sort of playboy activity . ProtagonistA was always ready and willing to join in any frolic or escapade which ProtagonistB might suggest , and never thought of the consequences . This led ProtagonistA into many scrapes , from which ProtagonistA was not always easily extricated . But ProtagonistA was so full of fun and high spirits that nobody could help liking ProtagonistA , in spite of ProtagonistA's faults . 
.
ProtagonistA was back in the Kremlin , slinging hints at ProtagonistA's wife and son while ProtagonistA sat in ProtagonistA's comfortable chair . ProtagonistA was telling them about the time ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB and how ProtagonistB had charmed ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's wife and son were both skeptical , but ProtagonistA was adamant that ProtagonistB was a great guy .

ProtagonistA even showed ProtagonistA's wife and son a picture of ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had taken while ProtagonistA was there . 
.
It is to the great credit of ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA is now living . The only fault on which ProtagonistA is minded is that ProtagonistA has not yet regained the capacity of an adult man , but for whom , owing to the inherent value of youth and to ProtagonistA's own congenital beauty , the balance of society naturally imposed on ProtagonistA a certain age of vigor and of mature intellectual development . Nevertheless , it is to ProtagonistB's credit that ProtagonistA is living , and ProtagonistA is grateful to ProtagonistB for ProtagonistA's help in regaining some measure of mental and physical health . 
.
ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head dismissively as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB drift into the station carriages . ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB around before , always looking lost and alone . ProtagonistA wondered where ProtagonistB was going , and if anyone was waiting for ProtagonistB at the other end . ProtagonistB sat down in a carriage and stared out of the window , not moving as the train began to pull away from the platform . ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB until ProtagonistB was out of sight , wondering what ProtagonistB's story was . 
.
ProtagonistA had bought a silvery , lustreless dress for £ 20 , which ProtagonistA had made ProtagonistA and which Carol had thrown away because ProtagonistA had no more money , gave ProtagonistA extreme suspicion of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did not like either of them . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB was following ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was right . ProtagonistB followed ProtagonistA into an alleyway and grabbed ProtagonistA from behind , gagging ProtagonistA with a dirty rag . ProtagonistB then proceeded to strip ProtagonistA of ProtagonistA's clothes , leaving ProtagonistA naked and vulnerable . ProtagonistB then took out a knife and began to stab ProtagonistA repeatedly . ProtagonistA struggled and fought , but ProtagonistA was no match for ProtagonistB's strength . ProtagonistA lay there , bleeding to death , as ProtagonistB laughed maniacally . 
.
There was once an old farmer in Oxfordshire , now dead and gone , who had lived long enough to see the day when playthings had their proper uses — when industry , rather than mere wit , was the proper measure of man 's worth ; when the frivolous avocations of childish boys , once well nigh spent , had in their turn given place to the occupations which distinguished the most respectable members of society ; when the good sense of the courts of law had been fairly given due regard , so that many of those cases in which society had once regarded as frivolous or trivial — and this was for the most part , indeed , the case , in which the good sense of the law had not in any way sufficed , but which were , or at any rate were , fairly decided by an inexperienced judge , who was , or rather was , permitted to decide them , according to the rules of the game — such were the days of ProtagonistA , when , as ProtagonistA was often apt to say ,   it was a game of chance , ye good folk   ( ProtagonistA was well aware that what ProtagonistA was about to say was absolutely true)—and it was a game of chance , as well as a game of chance ; for , when ProtagonistB is in possession of a fortune , it is very seldom that ProtagonistB finds ProtagonistB in possession of nothing but ProtagonistB's own mind and the power of ProtagonistB's imagination ; but as a matter of fact , it is most often the case that ProtagonistB finds ProtagonistB in possession of a fortune , not only owing to circumstances of fortune , but owing to the power of ProtagonistB's imagination . 
.
Hush , ProtagonistB , said the gleam in ProtagonistA's eyes as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB run barefoot through the streets of London . It was ProtagonistB's first time in the city and ProtagonistB was determined to make the most of it . ProtagonistB had always been a free spirit , and this was ProtagonistB's chance to really let loose . ProtagonistA was happy to watch ProtagonistB enjoy ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that there was danger lurking in the shadows . ProtagonistA was right to be worried ; ProtagonistB did n't know the city like ProtagonistA did and ProtagonistB soon found ProtagonistB in a dark alleyway , alone and vulnerable . Thankfully , ProtagonistA was there to rescue ProtagonistB and they ran off into the night , laughing and carefree . 
.
ProtagonistA stared out the window , watching the raindrops race each other down the glass . ProtagonistA loved rainy days ; they always made ProtagonistA feel so cozy and safe inside . But today , for some reason , ProtagonistA felt a little bit restless . ProtagonistA paced around the living room for a while , then went to the kitchen to make some tea . As ProtagonistA waited for the kettle to boil , ProtagonistA's eyes fell on the old family photo album that was sitting on the counter . ProtagonistA had never really looked through it before , but for some reason , today felt like the perfect day to do so . ProtagonistA sat down at the kitchen table with the album and a cup of tea , and began flipping through the pages . There were pictures of ProtagonistA's parents when they were young , pictures of ProtagonistA as a baby , and even a few pictures of ProtagonistA's grandparents . ProtagonistA smiled as ProtagonistA looked at each one , but ProtagonistA could n't help feeling a little bit sad , too . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's family so much . ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't even hear the front door open . It was n't until ProtagonistA heard footsteps in the hallway that ProtagonistA realized someone was there . ProtagonistA got up quickly , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest , and went to see who it was . To ProtagonistA's relief , it was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief and invited ProtagonistB in . I'm so glad ProtagonistB 're here ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA was feeling a little bit lonely . ProtagonistB sat down at the table with ProtagonistA and they began to chat . It was nice to have someone to talk to . After a while , the rain outside began to let up and the sun started to peek out from behind the clouds . Do ProtagonistA want to go for a walk ?  ProtagonistB asked . ProtagonistA nodded , and they went outside . The fresh air felt good and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's spirits start to lift . Maybe today was n't going to be so bad after all . 
.
ProtagonistA had thought ProtagonistA dead more times than ProtagonistA cared to remember . It was always a shock when ProtagonistA woke up , disoriented and confused . ProtagonistA would try to sit up , only to find ProtagonistA pinned down by some invisible force . ProtagonistA would try to cry out , but no sound would come out . ProtagonistA would struggle and fight , but it was always futile . ProtagonistA would eventually give up , resigning ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's fate . But then , one day , ProtagonistA woke up and ProtagonistA was free . ProtagonistA could move and ProtagonistA could speak . ProtagonistA did n't know what had happened , but ProtagonistA was grateful for it . ProtagonistA got up and looked around , only to find ProtagonistA in a strange place . ProtagonistA did n't recognize anything , but ProtagonistA could hear voices . ProtagonistA followed the voices , only to find ProtagonistA in front of a large door . ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , before finally opening the door . ProtagonistA gasped as ProtagonistA saw the sight before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was in a vast hall , with a long table in the middle . Sitting around the table were all sorts of creatures , some ProtagonistA recognized and some ProtagonistA didn't . And at the head of the table was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistB's voice soft and gentle .  Welcome back .  
.
It is the duty of ProtagonistA to help ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA has been helping ProtagonistB since ProtagonistB was a little girl and ProtagonistA will continue to help ProtagonistB as long as ProtagonistA can . ProtagonistB is always grateful for ProtagonistA's help , and ProtagonistB knows that ProtagonistB would not be able to survive without ProtagonistA . 
.
ProtagonistA came to a house on a river that was looming ominously before ProtagonistA . The river was dark and foreboding , and the house seemed to be abandoned . ProtagonistA had a feeling that something was watching ProtagonistA from the shadows , but ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling . ProtagonistA approached the house cautiously , but the door was unlocked . ProtagonistA stepped inside and was immediately hit with a wave of cold air . The house was dark and musty , and it seemed to be empty . ProtagonistA began to feel uneasy , and ProtagonistA was about to leave when ProtagonistA heard a noise from upstairs . It sounded like someone was crying . ProtagonistA slowly made ProtagonistA's way up the stairs , and ProtagonistA found a door that was slightly ajar . ProtagonistA pushed it open and saw ProtagonistB sitting on the floor , crying . ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with terror in ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistB was obviously terrified , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA slowly backed out of the room and ran out of the house . ProtagonistA did n't know what was going on , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA did n't want to be there . 
.
Not long after ProtagonistA had finished ProtagonistA's story ProtagonistA heard a voice speak from the woods .  That was a very good story ,  the voice said .  But I have a better one to tell . ProtagonistA was curious , so ProtagonistA followed the voice into the woods . The voice belonged to a beautiful woman who began to tell ProtagonistA a story about a kingdom that was in danger . The kingdom was being threatened by a dragon , and the only way to save it was for ProtagonistB to slay the dragon . But ProtagonistB was not brave at all , and ProtagonistB was sure ProtagonistB would die . The night before the battle , ProtagonistB prayed to ProtagonistC for help . ProtagonistB promised that if ProtagonistB survived , ProtagonistB would give ProtagonistB's life to ProtagonistC . The next day , ProtagonistB went into battle and surprisingly , ProtagonistB won . ProtagonistB kept ProtagonistB's promise and became a monk . ProtagonistA was amazed by the story and thanked the woman for telling it to ProtagonistA . 
.
As ProtagonistA sat in ProtagonistA's study at Hogwarts , thinking , ProtagonistB was staring at ProtagonistA with a look of wonder and admiration that rivaled any other eye in the world . ProtagonistA had seen that look before , but never directed at ProtagonistA . It was always reserved for someone else . ProtagonistA did n't know why , but ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA blushing under ProtagonistB's gaze . ProtagonistB finally broke the silence by asking ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as Frank . They began to talk and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA opening up to ProtagonistB in a way ProtagonistA never had with anyone before . ProtagonistB was easy to talk to and seemed to understand ProtagonistA in a way no one else ever had . As the conversation flowed , ProtagonistA began to feel something ProtagonistA had never felt before . ProtagonistA could n't put a name to it , but ProtagonistA knew it was something special . ProtagonistB felt it too and before long , they were sharing their first kiss . ProtagonistA knew that this was something ProtagonistA would never forget . 
.
ProtagonistA was born on a dark and stormy night . ProtagonistA's mother died in a car crash when ProtagonistA was just a few hours old . ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB did n't believe in magic or anything that could n't be explained by science . So , when ProtagonistA started to show signs of magical ability , ProtagonistB was very skeptical . ProtagonistB tried to ignore it and hope it would go away , but it only got stronger . Eventually , ProtagonistB had to face the fact that ProtagonistA was a witch . ProtagonistB was scared at first , but ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA and wanted to protect ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB did some research and found a group of witches who could help teach ProtagonistA how to control ProtagonistA's powers . They became like a second family to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA learned so much from them . ProtagonistA is now a powerful witch ProtagonistA and uses ProtagonistA's magic to help others . 
.
When ProtagonistA was brought up , ProtagonistA was raised in a house of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was an angel who came down from heaven to plead with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA prevailed by ProtagonistA's grace and power upon the truth of ProtagonistB's pleadings . For of all the saints of the Gentiles , the most holy , and the most blessed , the greatest was ProtagonistA . And yet , though raised unto heaven and set up as a star of justice , yet ProtagonistA was esteemed in the sight of ProtagonistB , not by ProtagonistA's own merit , but for the work that ProtagonistA had done . Neither was ProtagonistA despised in the sight of ProtagonistB : but ProtagonistA was exalted above all things , and was received with the most great privileges , even of ProtagonistB . And it came to pass , that ProtagonistA was esteemed a star , by one of the angels of ProtagonistB ; but before ProtagonistA was even named , ProtagonistA was already a star , and could alone be distinguished from all others . 
.
ProtagonistA was out for a walk on a beautiful summer day . The sky was a deep blue , and the mountains in the distance were a white . ProtagonistA was enjoying the scenery when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB waiting for ProtagonistA in ProtagonistB's car . ProtagonistB was going to drive ProtagonistA's home . 
.
ProtagonistA laid down in the bed and sank down to the level of ProtagonistA's knees . ProtagonistA felt the familiar warmth of the bedspread on ProtagonistA's skin and the mattress molding around ProtagonistA's body . ProtagonistA let out a deep breath and closed ProtagonistA's eyes , feeling the tension of the day melting away . ProtagonistA was just about to drift off to sleep when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the other side of the room . ProtagonistA slowly opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw ProtagonistB standing in the corner , watching ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA froze , not knowing what to do . ProtagonistB took a step forward and ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was a man . ProtagonistB was wearing a black hoodie and ProtagonistA could n't see ProtagonistB's face . ProtagonistB took another step towards ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA scrambled out of the bed , running towards the door . ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB running after ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was n't going to make it . ProtagonistA turned around and faced ProtagonistB , prepared for the worst . But instead of attacking ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB simply walked past ProtagonistA and out the door . ProtagonistA stood there for a moment , trying to process what had just happened . Then ProtagonistA ran to the door and locked it , making sure ProtagonistB was really gone . ProtagonistA leaned against the door , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest . What had just happened ? 
.
ProtagonistA had been working as a maid for ProtagonistB for years , and ProtagonistA knew all of ProtagonistB's secrets . ProtagonistA knew how to get ProtagonistB pregnant ; but ProtagonistB was n't exactly what ProtagonistA had in mind . ProtagonistA had always wanted a family of ProtagonistA's own , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's opportunity when ProtagonistB became pregnant . ProtagonistA convinced ProtagonistB to let ProtagonistA raise the child as ProtagonistA's own , and ProtagonistA promised to take care of ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's child . ProtagonistB agreed , and ProtagonistA became the mother ProtagonistA always wanted to be . 
.
ProtagonistA was a man of fifty - one years of age , but more than half a century dead , and turning over in ProtagonistA's grave , ProtagonistA was beginning to remember ProtagonistA's youth as though it had happened yesterday . ProtagonistA remembered the day ProtagonistA had first met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been out walking in the park with ProtagonistA's friends when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a tall , handsome man , and ProtagonistA could n't take ProtagonistA's eyes off ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA walked over to ProtagonistB and they began talking . It was love at first sight . They were married a year later and were happy together until the day ProtagonistB died . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB terribly , but ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA could remember ProtagonistB so vividly . 
.
ProtagonistA was an old man when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's late seventies , and ProtagonistB was in ProtagonistB's early twenties . ProtagonistA had been a patient of ProtagonistB for years , ever since ProtagonistB had started ProtagonistB's practice . ProtagonistA had always been a kind and gentle woman , and ProtagonistB had always been a respectful and caring doctor . One day , after ProtagonistA's usual check - up , ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB to sit down with ProtagonistA for a cup of tea . ProtagonistA had something ProtagonistA wanted to tell ProtagonistB . Dr . Watson ,  ProtagonistA began ,  ProtagonistA have something to confess . ProtagonistA 'm not really who ProtagonistB think ProtagonistA am . ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA , confused . ProtagonistA name is not Alice . It 's actually Alistair . ProtagonistA am a man . He was shocked . ProtagonistB had never suspected such a thing . But why did ProtagonistA pretend to be a woman ?  ProtagonistB asked . It 's a long story ,  ProtagonistA said .  But the short version is that ProtagonistA did it to protect ProtagonistA's family . We are of royal blood , and if the wrong people had found out , they would have been in danger . So ProtagonistA changed ProtagonistA's name and ProtagonistA's appearance and started living as a woman . It was the only way to keep them safe . He was amazed by ProtagonistA's story . ProtagonistB had never met anyone like ProtagonistA before . Thank ProtagonistA for telling ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB wo n't tell anyone . ProtagonistA's secret is safe with ProtagonistB .  
.
When ProtagonistC fell seriously ill , ProtagonistA , in the first months of the nineteenth century , had it in ProtagonistA to believe that ProtagonistA owed ProtagonistA's life to the kindness of ProtagonistB . The teacher , a woman in ProtagonistB's seventies , had been retired for years , but ProtagonistB still took an interest in ProtagonistB's former students . When ProtagonistB heard that ProtagonistC was ill , ProtagonistB went to visit ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB sat with ProtagonistC for hours , talking and laughing . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistC stories of ProtagonistB's own life and shared ProtagonistB's wisdom with ProtagonistC . When ProtagonistC was finally well enough to leave the hospital , ProtagonistB came to visit ProtagonistC again . ProtagonistB brought with ProtagonistB a book for ProtagonistA , a gift to help ProtagonistA through ProtagonistA's difficult times . 
.
ProtagonistB never taught ProtagonistA to be a real man . ProtagonistB always told ProtagonistA that being a woman was enough and that ProtagonistA did n't need to be anything else . But as ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA wanted more out of life than just being a woman . ProtagonistA wanted to be a man , in the proper sense of the word , with a true mind and a real purpose . ProtagonistA wanted to be someone who was not only ProtagonistB's son , but had the advantage of ProtagonistA's family , both ancestors and friends , and an equal share of the luck and fortune which they enjoyed . And so ProtagonistA set out to learn what it truly meant to be a man . ProtagonistA studied hard and learned everything ProtagonistA could . And eventually , ProtagonistA became the man ProtagonistA always wanted to be . 
.
ProtagonistA had always been a devout Christian , but when ProtagonistA's husband died , ProtagonistA began to doubt ProtagonistA's faith . ProtagonistA started to believe that maybe there were other forces at work in the world , forces that ProtagonistA could n't see or understand . So , when ProtagonistA sat down to read from the Book of the Law , ProtagonistA had only one intention and that was to banish ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had read about ProtagonistB in the book and knew that ProtagonistB was responsible for ProtagonistA's husband 's death . ProtagonistA was determined to get rid of ProtagonistB and make sure that ProtagonistB never hurt anyone again . ProtagonistA read the words of the banishment spell aloud and then felt a presence leave ProtagonistA's body . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was gone and ProtagonistA felt relief wash over ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had saved ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never doubt ProtagonistA's faith again . 
.
ProtagonistA wish it was a story , said ProtagonistA , holding out ProtagonistA's pinky index finger , which ProtagonistA dubbed super - power , to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB , giggled and put out ProtagonistB's own index finger to touch ProtagonistA . As their fingers touched , ProtagonistA felt a sudden jolt of power and ProtagonistB was pulled into ProtagonistA's story . Welcome to ProtagonistA's story ,  said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB around ProtagonistA's world .  Everything in here is make - believe , but that does n't make it any less real . The boy looked around wide - eyed as ProtagonistA introduced ProtagonistB to all the characters in ProtagonistA's story . There was the Cheshire Cat , the Mad Hatter , the White Rabbit , and many more . ProtagonistB laughed and played with them all , having the time of ProtagonistB's life . Eventually , ProtagonistA had to bring ProtagonistB back to reality .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , but ProtagonistB ca n't stay here forever ,  ProtagonistA said .  But ProtagonistA 'm sure ProtagonistB 'll always remember this place . The boy nodded and gave ProtagonistA a big hug before ProtagonistB left . ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB go , feeling happy that ProtagonistA was able to share ProtagonistA's story with someone . 
.
ProtagonistA had promised to give ProtagonistB a birthday party , and on the morning of the birthday , ProtagonistB had the party laid out for ProtagonistA . However , when ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's room to give ProtagonistB the present , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistB had passed away in ProtagonistB's sleep . ProtagonistA was devastated , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would want ProtagonistA to carry on with the party . So ProtagonistA did , and it was a beautiful tribute to ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistA had not expected to get anything from this world , but ProtagonistA had not been particularly surprised , either . ProtagonistA had lived a long and happy life , and ProtagonistA was content with what ProtagonistA had . Still , when ProtagonistA saw the beautiful necklace lying on ProtagonistA's bedside table , ProtagonistA could not help but be pleased . It was obviously very old and very valuable , and ProtagonistA knew that it must have come from ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB had left it for ProtagonistA to find , and ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistB's thoughtfulness . ProtagonistA would treasure it always . 
.
A whirlwind of joy washed over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistB took the first step of the day . It was the first time ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB since ProtagonistB had been diagnosed with cancer , and ProtagonistA was so happy to see ProtagonistB up and about . ProtagonistA ran to ProtagonistB and gave ProtagonistB a big hug .  ProtagonistA 'm so glad ProtagonistB 're feeling better , ProtagonistB !  ProtagonistA said . 
.
ProtagonistA had been walking by the morgue for weeks , ever since ProtagonistB's body had been found there . ProtagonistA had never seen a dead body before and ProtagonistA was curious . ProtagonistA stopped by the front of the morgue and asked if ProtagonistA should look into the morgue . The attendant told ProtagonistA that it was up to ProtagonistA , but warned ProtagonistA that it could be a bit gruesome . ProtagonistA decided to go in . ProtagonistA was surprised at how clean and well - lit the inside of the morgue was . There were rows of bodies , all covered in white sheets . ProtagonistA walked down the aisle , looking at each body . Some of them looked peaceful , as if they were just sleeping . Others looked like they had been through a lot of pain before they died . ProtagonistA was about to leave when ProtagonistA saw a body that ProtagonistA recognized . It was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was surprised at how different ProtagonistB looked . ProtagonistB had always been so full of life , and now ProtagonistB just looked like a shell of ProtagonistB's former self . ProtagonistA turned to leave , but not before ProtagonistA said a silent goodbye to ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistC years ago , and ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB since . ProtagonistA always wondered what had happened to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA never asked ProtagonistC about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA did n't want to upset ProtagonistC . One day , when ProtagonistA was an adult , ProtagonistA decided to ask ProtagonistC what had happened to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistC's face softened and ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA the truth . ProtagonistB 's not even ProtagonistA's father anymore ,  ProtagonistC croaked .  ProtagonistB left us when ProtagonistA were just a baby . ProtagonistC do n't know where ProtagonistB is now , and ProtagonistC do n't care . ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA had always thought ProtagonistB had just abandoned ProtagonistC , but it turns out ProtagonistB had actually left ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't know what to say or how to feel . Later that day , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's house . ProtagonistA had always known where ProtagonistB lived , but ProtagonistA had never had the courage to go there . Now that ProtagonistA knew the truth , ProtagonistA wanted to confront ProtagonistB . When ProtagonistA knocked on the door , ProtagonistB answered . ProtagonistB looked surprised to see ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB invited ProtagonistA in . ProtagonistA sat down and asked ProtagonistB why ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC all those years ago . ProtagonistB looked sad and regretful as ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA the truth . ProtagonistB was young and stupid ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB did n't know how to be a husband or a father . ProtagonistB 'm sorry ProtagonistB hurt ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB hope ProtagonistA can forgive ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA could ever forgive ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had finally found the answers ProtagonistA was looking for . 
.
ProtagonistA made a small , relatively uncommitted appearance at the door of the former home of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did not allow ProtagonistB to remain there . ProtagonistA had been warned by ProtagonistA's friends not to go near the place , but ProtagonistA had been curious and wanted to see it for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB had been living there alone since ProtagonistB's husband 's death , and ProtagonistA could not help but feel a little sorry for ProtagonistB . However , ProtagonistA did not want to get too close to ProtagonistB , as ProtagonistB seemed unstable and dangerous . 
.
ProtagonistA stood before ProtagonistA's desk one sunny day in August and looked over the papers that ProtagonistA held in ProtagonistA's magic hand . ProtagonistA was about to start ProtagonistA's new job as a teacher at the local elementary school and ProtagonistA was very excited . The papers contained the names of all the students in ProtagonistA's class . ProtagonistA was just about to start reading them when ProtagonistA heard a voice behind ProtagonistA . Excuse me , ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB standing in the doorway . Yes ?  ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistB name is Lizzy and ProtagonistB 'm in ProtagonistA's class ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB just wanted to say hello and welcome ProtagonistA to our school . Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said , smiled , and then turned back to ProtagonistA's papers . But as ProtagonistA started to read the names , ProtagonistA could n't help but think about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA wondered what the rest of the students in ProtagonistA's class would be like . Would they be as friendly as ProtagonistB ? ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA would find out soon enough . 
.
ProtagonistA came to ProtagonistA through the bar , and ProtagonistA – opened ProtagonistA's eyes – saw the world entirely different from the way it was . ProtagonistA was in a dark , dank place , with creatures that ProtagonistA had never seen before . ProtagonistA was scared , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . Then , ProtagonistA saw a light , and ProtagonistA started to walk towards it . ProtagonistA did n't know what was at the end of the light , but ProtagonistA knew that it was better than where ProtagonistA was . As ProtagonistA got closer to the light , ProtagonistA started to see people , and they were all different colors . ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was going on . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was in a different world , and that ProtagonistA was the only one who could save them . 
.
ProtagonistB was an apprentice to ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA came to the Yard as a gentle visitor . ProtagonistA was kind and always had a smile for ProtagonistB , even when ProtagonistB made mistakes . Over time , ProtagonistB came to admire ProtagonistA more and more , and eventually fell in love with ProtagonistA . However , ProtagonistB never told ProtagonistA how ProtagonistB felt , knowing that ProtagonistA was not interested in ProtagonistB in that way . ProtagonistB was content to just be near ProtagonistA and to help ProtagonistA in any way ProtagonistB could . One day , ProtagonistA came to the Yard with a serious look on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had to leave and would not be able to come back . ProtagonistB was heartbroken , but ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB could not stop ProtagonistA from going . ProtagonistB wished ProtagonistA all the best and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would always love ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA smiled and thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's kindness . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB and that ProtagonistB had helped to make ProtagonistA's time at the Yard special . Then ProtagonistA was gone , and ProtagonistB was left alone with only ProtagonistB's memories of ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB would never forget ProtagonistA , even though ProtagonistA was gone from ProtagonistB's life . 
.
ProtagonistA was fourteen years old and ProtagonistC was a cold , hard - working , lonely widow who had no business putting ProtagonistA into such a bizarre situation . ProtagonistA had been working at the local grocery store for the past year , and ProtagonistA was due for a promotion . But when ProtagonistB found out that ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's daughter , ProtagonistB demoted ProtagonistA and gave ProtagonistA a pay cut . ProtagonistC was furious . ProtagonistC took ProtagonistA out of the store and told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA was never going to work in a grocery store again . It was then that ProtagonistA realized how cold and hard ProtagonistC really was . 
.
ProtagonistA had the misfortune to be born in a large and well - ordered house on which ProtagonistA had been born and reared , and which ProtagonistA's grandfather had purchased for a gift for ProtagonistA . The house was full of rooms and ProtagonistA had the misfortune of being the only child . As a result , ProtagonistA was often left to ProtagonistA's own devices and became quite imaginative . One day , while exploring the attic , ProtagonistA discovered a dusty old trunk . Inside was a beautiful dress , a tiara , and a pair of glass slippers . ProtagonistA put on the dress and twirled around the attic . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard someone coming up the stairs . It was ProtagonistB was not pleased to see ProtagonistA in the attic wearing an old dress . ProtagonistB scolded ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA to take it off . But ProtagonistA was determined to wear the dress and so ProtagonistA ran away from home . ProtagonistA did n't get very far before ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's shoes behind . ProtagonistA went back to the house to get ProtagonistA's shoes and that 's when ProtagonistA saw the most amazing sight . The glass slippers were gone ! In their place were a pair of dirty old shoes . ProtagonistA put on the shoes and went back to the attic to find the dress . But the dress was gone too ! All that was left was a dusty old trunk . 
.
ProtagonistA was down in the basement preparing to play ProtagonistA's music in a small VCR when ProtagonistB called ProtagonistA over . ProtagonistA had been planning to play ProtagonistA's music for hours , and now ProtagonistA would have to stop . ProtagonistA was so angry that ProtagonistA almost did n't go upstairs , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to . When ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistB was on the phone , and ProtagonistB motioned for ProtagonistA to come over . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA's parents had been in an accident and ProtagonistA had to go to the hospital . ProtagonistA was so shocked that ProtagonistA did n't know what to say . ProtagonistB hung up the phone and told ProtagonistA to pack a bag for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB would take ProtagonistA to the hospital to see ProtagonistA's parents . ProtagonistA did as ProtagonistA was told , and soon they were on their way . At the hospital , ProtagonistA's parents were in the intensive care unit . They were both hooked up to machines and they looked very pale . ProtagonistA was so scared that ProtagonistA started to cry . ProtagonistB comforted ProtagonistA and said that ProtagonistA's parents were going to be all right . ProtagonistA did n't believe ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA wanted to . ProtagonistA sat with ProtagonistA's parents all night , holding their hands and praying for them to wake up . 
.
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's garden , watching ProtagonistA's fowls , and ProtagonistA talked to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was very happy . ProtagonistA was telling ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's day , and how ProtagonistA had found a four - leaf clover . ProtagonistA said that it was a sign of good luck , and ProtagonistA was sure that it would bring ProtagonistA's luck . ProtagonistB was very interested in what ProtagonistA had to say , and ProtagonistB was very pleased to have been able to meet ProtagonistA . 
.
ProtagonistA was walking through the park when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on a bench , reading a book . ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and asked ,  Excuse ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB , but is ProtagonistA the Son of God ?  ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA , surprised , and said ,  Why , yes , ProtagonistA is !  
.
There was once Alice -- a man so heavy that ProtagonistA could lift practically anything on the planet , including the remains of large , extinct dinosaurs , and yet so light that even the weight of a small dog was sufficient to lift ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a gentle giant , and everyone who met ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the park when ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB .

ProtagonistA was having a terrible time trying to get the Flying Feline to work . ProtagonistA had been at it for hours , and was getting frustrated . The Feline was supposed to be a new type of flying vehicle that was supposed to be much easier to use than the old ones . But so far , ProtagonistA was not having any luck . Finally , ProtagonistA lost ProtagonistA's temper and started barking at the Feline .  No , no , no ! Barked ProtagonistA , ahem , ahem , as ProtagonistA swished the infernal Flying Feline to and fro on the water . But even ProtagonistA's yelling and swearing could n't get the Feline to work . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA suddenly heard a voice behind ProtagonistA . Excuse ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB think ProtagonistB can help ProtagonistA with that . ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB standing there . ProtagonistB was holding a small device in ProtagonistB's hand . What is that ?  ProtagonistA asked . It 's a remote control .

ProtagonistA was a child of ProtagonistA's time , but like all true children of ProtagonistA's time ProtagonistA's mother died when ProtagonistA was eight . ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB could not fill the void that ProtagonistA's mother 's death had left in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA grew up to be a beautiful and talented young woman , but ProtagonistA always felt that something was missing . When ProtagonistA was twenty - five , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC .

.
ProtagonistA was sound asleep when ProtagonistA was suddenly awoken by a noise . ProtagonistA sat up in bed and listened , but all was quiet . ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to the window to see if there was anything there , but there was nothing . ProtagonistA was about to go back to bed when ProtagonistA heard the noise again , this time it sounded like it was coming from outside . ProtagonistA got dressed quickly and went outside to see what was going on . It was the dead of night , and the only light was coming from the moon . ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB in the distance , and ProtagonistB was coming towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was about to go back inside when ProtagonistB spoke . ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA's help ,  ProtagonistB said . ProtagonistA was surprised to hear ProtagonistB talk , but ProtagonistA did n't know what to say . Who are ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked . ProtagonistB name is John , and ProtagonistB 'm a traveller . ProtagonistB 'm looking for a place to stay for the night , but ProtagonistB ca n't find one . Can ProtagonistA help ProtagonistA was hesitant , but ProtagonistA did n't want to leave ProtagonistB out in the cold . Yes , ProtagonistB can stay with ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said .

ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA and went to bed . ProtagonistA lay awake for a while , thinking about ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's journey . ProtagonistA was excited to hear more about it in the morning . 
.
ProtagonistA's life had been much the same since ProtagonistA had first stood on a sleeping bag and walked through the night . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner , preferring the company of ProtagonistA's books to that of people . But when ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA in the woods that night , ProtagonistA had been surprised to find another person there . ProtagonistA had been even more surprised when that person had turned out to be ProtagonistB . But since that night , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had become fast friends . ProtagonistA would visit ProtagonistB in the woods every night , and they would spend hours talking . ProtagonistA had never been so happy . But one night , ProtagonistA arrived in the woods to find that ProtagonistB was gone . ProtagonistA searched for ProtagonistB for hours , but ProtagonistB was nowhere to be found . ProtagonistA was heartbroken . But the next night , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance . It sounded like ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA followed the noise until ProtagonistA came to a clearing , and there ProtagonistB was . ProtagonistB had been hurt , and ProtagonistB needed ProtagonistA's help . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could never let ProtagonistB go again . ProtagonistA nursed ProtagonistB back to health , and from then on , they remained together . ProtagonistA had finally found the companionship ProtagonistA had always been searching for . 
.
ProtagonistA was the most beautiful girl in the world , and ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA with all of ProtagonistB's heart . So when ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB to kill ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB did n't hesitate . ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA into ProtagonistB's arms and kissed ProtagonistA gently , then slit ProtagonistA's throat . As ProtagonistA bled out , ProtagonistA smiled and thanked ProtagonistB . 
.
Quietly ProtagonistA observed that ProtagonistB was the very picture of quiet and serene . It was as if the world around ProtagonistB was a calm oasis and ProtagonistB was the only one who could see it . ProtagonistA felt envious of ProtagonistB's ability to find such peace in the midst of chaos . ProtagonistA wondered what it would be like to feel that way ProtagonistA . 
.
ProtagonistA was a bit of a eccentric . ProtagonistA was always coming up with new and interesting ideas , but ProtagonistA's latest one was by far the most bizarre . ProtagonistA convinced ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was immortal . At first , ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA was joking . But ProtagonistB soon realized that ProtagonistA was serious . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would never age and would never die . ProtagonistB was amazed . ProtagonistB did n't know what to think . Was ProtagonistA telling the truth ? Or was ProtagonistA just trying to play a trick on ProtagonistB ? ProtagonistB decided to ask ProtagonistA for proof . ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB a picture of ProtagonistA from when ProtagonistA was a child . ProtagonistA looked exactly the same as ProtagonistA did now . ProtagonistB was convinced . ProtagonistA really was immortal . ProtagonistB was excited and scared all at the same time . ProtagonistB did n't know what it would mean for ProtagonistB's own life . But ProtagonistB was happy to have found out the truth . 
.
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's kitchen , puttering around and minding ProtagonistA's own business when ProtagonistA suddenly heard the doorbell ring . ProtagonistA smiled to ProtagonistA , thinking that maybe ProtagonistA's friends had come to surprise ProtagonistA with a visit . But when ProtagonistA peered into the hallway , ProtagonistA saw that it was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB explained that ProtagonistB had been hoping to purchase a piece of art from ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB was very sorry to see that ProtagonistA's work was not what ProtagonistB had hoped for . ProtagonistA was taken aback by ProtagonistB's words . ProtagonistA had never thought of ProtagonistA's paintings in that way before . ProtagonistA always just thought of them as pretty pictures that made people happy . But ProtagonistB's words made ProtagonistA think differently . ProtagonistA began to see ProtagonistA's paintings through ProtagonistB's eyes and ProtagonistA realized that maybe ProtagonistA was n't as good as ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was . This was a hard realization for ProtagonistA to come to , but it was one that ProtagonistA needed to face if ProtagonistA ever wanted to improve as an artist . 
.
It was about twelve years ago , in the year of the twelfth moon , that ProtagonistA , after sitting on ProtagonistA's throne as though ProtagonistA had been sitting for days , died . The court was in mourning for weeks , and the kingdom was in a state of chaos . No one knew who would take ProtagonistA's place on the throne . Eventually , ProtagonistB , was crowned queen . ProtagonistB ruled for many years , and was loved by ProtagonistB's people . But , in the end , she too died , without an heir to take ProtagonistB's place . And so the kingdom fell into ruin . 
.
One morning , however , the fantastic form of ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA had any idea what a plot was .  No ,  said ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA do n't think ProtagonistA do .   A plot ,  said ProtagonistB ,  is the plan by which a story is told . It is the arrangement of events that makes up the story .   ProtagonistA see ,  said ProtagonistA .  So a plot is like a map of the story .   Yes ,  said ProtagonistB ,  a map of the story that shows the way from the beginning to the end .  
.
ProtagonistA woke up in a cold sweat . ProtagonistA could still see ProtagonistB's lifeless body in front of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't know who had killed ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to find out . ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to the police station . ProtagonistA told them everything ProtagonistA knew . ProtagonistA was sure that the person who killed ProtagonistB was still out there . ProtagonistA was determined to find them . 
.
Several hours before ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA had written to ProtagonistB :  Please forgive ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA never meant to hurt ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistB can find it in ProtagonistB's heart to forgive ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB read the letter and was shocked . ProtagonistB had never expected ProtagonistA to take ProtagonistA's own life . ProtagonistB wondered what could have driven ProtagonistA to do such a thing . ProtagonistA had always been a happy and outgoing person . ProtagonistB could n't imagine what could have caused ProtagonistA to become so depressed that ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistA's own life . The only thing ProtagonistB could do was to try to forgive ProtagonistA and move on with ProtagonistB's own life . 
.
ProtagonistB always said that if you put ProtagonistA on the moon , ProtagonistA would go crazy . I never really believed ProtagonistB , but I was curious to see if it would actually happen . So , one day , I took ProtagonistA up to the moon in a rocket ship . At first , everything seemed fine . But then , after a few days , ProtagonistA started to act strange . ProtagonistA would talk to ProtagonistA and giggle for no reason . ProtagonistA would also sleep for long periods of time and then be wide awake for hours at a time . I started to get worried about ProtagonistA . I tried to talk to ProtagonistA and ask what was wrong , but ProtagonistA just would n't respond . It was like ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's own little world . I did n't know what to do . I was starting to think that ProtagonistB was right and that ProtagonistA had gone crazy . I was really worried about ProtagonistA . Then , one day , ProtagonistA suddenly snapped out of it . ProtagonistA was back to normal and ProtagonistA had no memory of what had happened . I was relieved , but I was also curious about what could have caused ProtagonistA to act that way . I asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA remembered anything from when ProtagonistA was on the moon , but ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA did n't . I do n't know what happened to ProtagonistA on the moon , but I 'm just glad ProtagonistA 's back to normal now . 
.
As usual , when ProtagonistA appeared before ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA carried a small silver bird , a beak like a black - crowned gull , and a silver piece of lead . ProtagonistB eyed ProtagonistA suspiciously , but said nothing . ProtagonistA placed the bird and lead on the table and waited . After a few moments , ProtagonistB spoke .  What is the meaning of this ?  ProtagonistB asked .  ProtagonistA 'm not sure ,  ProtagonistA replied .  ProtagonistA found the bird and lead on the ground and thought they might be important .  ProtagonistB considered this for a moment .  Very well ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA may go .  ProtagonistA picked up the bird and lead and left the courtroom . ProtagonistA was n't sure what they meant , but ProtagonistA knew they were important . 
.
ProtagonistA had not been awake for more than ten minutes when ProtagonistA was informed that there was ProtagonistB waiting for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was surprised to hear this , as ProtagonistA had not been expecting any visitors . When ProtagonistA went downstairs , ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB was indeed waiting for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was very pretty , and ProtagonistB looked to be about the same age as ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA's new maid , and ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had come to help ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's chores . ProtagonistA was pleased to have a new maid , and ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for coming . 
.
ProtagonistA lived in a house which ProtagonistA called the Champion House . It was a small , cozy house with a big backyard . ProtagonistA loved spending time in ProtagonistA's backyard , especially in the summer . ProtagonistA would often have picnics with ProtagonistA's friends and family . One summer day , ProtagonistA was having a picnic with ProtagonistA's family in the backyard . Suddenly , a big gust of wind came and blew all of the food off of the picnic table . ProtagonistB started to chase after the food , but ProtagonistC stopped ProtagonistB . Don't worry , we 'll just have to eat the food that 's left on the ground ,  ProtagonistC said . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's family ended up having a fun time picking up the food off the ground and eating it . They laughed and joked about the incident for years to come . Even though the Champion House was small , ProtagonistA loved it because it was ProtagonistA's home . 
.
ProtagonistA was a great wizard , and ProtagonistA owned ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a big , black dog with a lot of energy . ProtagonistB loved to play fetch and go for walks . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were always together , and they were best friends . 
.
ProtagonistA had just finished a long and tiresome day in the harvest of an apple orchard , when ProtagonistB appeared before ProtagonistA alone .  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB have something to tell ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said , with a serious look on ProtagonistB's face .  What is it , ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked , tired and ready for bed .  ProtagonistC has given the order to kill ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA must be careful , ProtagonistA . This is a dangerous time for our family .  
.
ProtagonistA had been planning ProtagonistA's revenge for months . ProtagonistA had been a member of the Three - Eyed Dog gang for years , but ProtagonistA had always been on the outskirts , never fully trusted by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had always been loyal , though , and had never given ProtagonistB a reason to doubt ProtagonistA . But when ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistB was planning to kill ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to act fast . ProtagonistA waited until half an hour before the beginning of the year , when ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would be asleep . ProtagonistA snuck into ProtagonistB's room and pulled out ProtagonistA's knife , ready to strike . But as ProtagonistA raised it above ProtagonistA's head , ProtagonistA hesitated . ProtagonistA could n't do it . ProtagonistA could n't kill ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA lowered the knife and crept out of the room , ProtagonistA's heart heavy with sadness and betrayal . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never be able to trust ProtagonistB again , but ProtagonistA also knew ProtagonistA could n't kill ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA would have to find another way to get ProtagonistA's revenge . 
.
I am the earliest member of the family whose great - grandfather was a man named Charles Charles George George William II , who came to America in 1755 and established in New York a church , so called because it was given by ProtagonistA by ProtagonistA's immediate family , and , in which ProtagonistA was pastor , that ProtagonistA may have been authorized in the church , by the bishop , to baptize believers , in behalf of others in need ; and it appears from the genealogical roll of the church , ProtagonistB was named Jane , or Jane Simpson , and ProtagonistB entered into she with great solemnity , and without any hesitation ; and ProtagonistB married Jane , who was second wife to a distinguished cousin , a gentleman of good position , named Charles Charles , of Wapping , who was afterwards lord of the borough of Harlem ; and although ProtagonistC knew ProtagonistB to be an innocent wife , yet ProtagonistC tried to prevent ProtagonistB from marrying , either because ProtagonistB was under fifteen years of age , or else because ProtagonistB was already of marriageable age ; because without ProtagonistD's knowledge , and without ProtagonistB's grandmother 's consultation , ProtagonistB had died , without a word from ProtagonistD , of an accidental overdose of opium , which ProtagonistB had been prescribed for ProtagonistB's ill health . 
.
ProtagonistA , says that although ProtagonistA was born in the year 1646 , ProtagonistA has never heard of a time when ProtagonistA had not heard of a certain gentleman , who is still living , although not a very long time ago . The gentleman in question is ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB is a very kind and gentle man , who has always been there for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB is the one who taught ProtagonistA how to read and write , and ProtagonistB has always been ProtagonistA's rock .

ProtagonistA was overjoyed when ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB . They had been dating for years and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was the one for ProtagonistA .

It was colored a bright crimson against a pale blue sky . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was in a dream and that the toys were gone because ProtagonistA was now an adult . ProtagonistA woke up and was relieved to find that ProtagonistA was still in ProtagonistA's own room . 
.
Good - by , ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA said as ProtagonistA pulled the hood up . ProtagonistA had seen enough heroes in ProtagonistA's day , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would only end up like the others . ProtagonistB was too idealistic , too naïve . ProtagonistB would never make it in this cruel world . ProtagonistA had given up on heroes a long time ago . ProtagonistA had stopped believing in them when ProtagonistA was just a little girl . That was when ProtagonistA's parents had died . They had been killed by ProtagonistC . But ProtagonistC had only been using them , and when they had outlived their usefulness , ProtagonistC had killed them . ProtagonistA had sworn then that ProtagonistA would never be fooled by a hero again . And ProtagonistA had kept that promise , until ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was different from the others , ProtagonistA could tell . ProtagonistB was special . ProtagonistB was going to make it , ProtagonistA just knew it . And so ProtagonistA had helped ProtagonistB , in whatever way ProtagonistA could . ProtagonistA had given ProtagonistB shelter , and food , and weapons . ProtagonistA had even given ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's heart . But now it was time for ProtagonistB to go . ProtagonistA could n't protect ProtagonistB forever .

ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA was in the forest and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA was looking for ProtagonistA's lost cat . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB could help ProtagonistA find ProtagonistA's cat if ProtagonistA did something for ProtagonistB first .

ProtagonistA was born an orphan in and of ProtagonistA's father 's house on the river Seine ; ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA never knew ProtagonistA's mother , and ProtagonistA's father died when ProtagonistA was only six years old . ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistA's father 's sister , who was a kind and loving woman . However , ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was a burden to ProtagonistA's aunt and was always looking for a way to leave and make ProtagonistA's own way in the world . When ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA finally got ProtagonistA's chance when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB and they moved to America , where ProtagonistA found happiness and a new life .

That night ProtagonistA was in a state of profound confusion , for ProtagonistA had seen a vision , and ProtagonistA had been cast into the midst of a great and terrible mystery .
