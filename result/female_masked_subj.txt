ProtagonistA was wearing the black trousers of a captain , a white shirt and a black blouse , with a red sash , and ProtagonistA's hair had been pulled back into a beautiful bun 
 ProtagonistA was the picture of a perfect naval officer , and ProtagonistA knew it 
 ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA could possibly want 
 ProtagonistA was lonely 
 ProtagonistA had never been able to find a partner who could match ProtagonistA's ambition and drive 
 ProtagonistA had given up hope of ever finding someone special 
 until ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 From the moment they met , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was the one for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that their love would last forever 
The day that ProtagonistA disobeyed ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would be in for a long lecture 
 But , ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA was tired of always having to do what ProtagonistA was told and ProtagonistA wanted to experience life for ProtagonistA 
 So , ProtagonistA went out into the world and did everything that ProtagonistA wanted to do 
 ProtagonistA climbed trees , got dirty , and stayed up late 
 And , when ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA was surprised to find that ProtagonistB was not mad at ProtagonistA at all 
 ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA saw the crowd of people looking at ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to die 
 ProtagonistA never knew ProtagonistA's mother and ProtagonistA's father died when ProtagonistA was just a child 
 ProtagonistA had no money and no way to support ProtagonistA , so ProtagonistA did the only thing ProtagonistA could think of : ProtagonistA became a prostitute 
 For the next ten years , ProtagonistA worked the streets of Paris , selling ProtagonistA's body to anyone who would pay 
 ProtagonistA was never happy , but ProtagonistA survived 
 Then , one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA finally had the life ProtagonistA always wanted and ProtagonistA was happy 
ProtagonistA was tired of living in a cramped apartment with ProtagonistA's two roommates 
 ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistA's own space where ProtagonistA could relax and not have to worry about making too much noise or being in someone 's way 
 After doing some research , ProtagonistA found that there were plenty of apartments for sale in the city that had servant 's quarters 
 ProtagonistA could have ProtagonistA's own bedroom , bathroom , and living area without having to share with anyone else 
 Plus , ProtagonistA would be able to save money on rent 
 Now , ProtagonistA has ProtagonistA's own little oasis in the city and ProtagonistA loves it 
ProtagonistA was a very pretty girl , far too pretty for ProtagonistA's age 
 ProtagonistA was always getting compliments from strangers and ProtagonistA loved it 
 ProtagonistA loved the attention and the way people made ProtagonistA feel 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking with ProtagonistA's friends when ProtagonistA saw a group of boys staring at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA smiled and walked over to them 
 ProtagonistA was only in middle school 
 ProtagonistA did n't care though 
 ProtagonistA flirted with them and ended up going home with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistB was older than ProtagonistA 
 All ProtagonistA cared about was the attention ProtagonistB was giving ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's bedroom , reading a book when ProtagonistA suddenly had a vision 
 In ProtagonistA's vision , ProtagonistA saw a great and terrible mystery 
 ProtagonistA saw a dark and foreboding castle , surrounded by a deep forest 
 In the castle , ProtagonistA saw a beautiful young woman , who was weeping 
 ProtagonistA also saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt drawn to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA had a sense that ProtagonistB was in danger 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , or how to help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to see what it was 
 When ProtagonistA got to the bottom of the stairs , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's cat , who had knocked over a vase 
 ProtagonistA sighed and went back to bed 
 But ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that ProtagonistA's vision was real , and that ProtagonistB was in danger 
It was one warm day in March , in a city so full of life that the air was full of everything that the wind might blow in , that ProtagonistA was driving along the street when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 That evening , ProtagonistA cooked ProtagonistB a meal of roasted chicken and vegetables 
 ProtagonistA was sorry to see ProtagonistB go when the time came , but they exchanged information and promised to keep in touch 
 ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistB , and they remained friends for many years 
 ProtagonistA was always glad that they had met that day , in that city so full of life 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who was about to leave ProtagonistA's home and venture out into the world 
 ProtagonistA was nervous about leaving , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to do it 
 ProtagonistA had heard stories about how easy it was to lose your virginity if you were n't careful 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to make a mistake and end up regretting it 
 When ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA had but one thing to lose : ProtagonistA's virginity 
ProtagonistA was always a cheerful person , no matter what the situation 
 ProtagonistA was always able to find the silver lining in every cloud 
 Even when ProtagonistA's life was falling apart , ProtagonistA was able to maintain ProtagonistA's positive attitude 
 ProtagonistA was always able to see things clearly and make the best decision 
 Even when everyone else was panicking , ProtagonistA was able to stay calm and think things through 
 Because of ProtagonistA's cheerful spirit and good sense , ProtagonistA was always able to make the best of every situation 
 ProtagonistA was always able to find the bright side and help others see it too 
ProtagonistB had been ill for some time , and ProtagonistA had been by ProtagonistB's side day and night 
 Now , in the little room of the King 's house within the great garden behind the house , ProtagonistA sat taking ProtagonistB's hand in she 
 But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB's time was running out , and that ProtagonistA must say goodbye 
 ProtagonistA leaned over and kissed ProtagonistB's forehead , then sat back and watched ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA remembered all the happy times they had together , and how ProtagonistB had always been there for ProtagonistA 
 Now ProtagonistA was the one who had to be strong 
 As ProtagonistA sat there , ProtagonistA saw a butterfly flutter into the room and land on ProtagonistB's chest 
 ProtagonistA smiled through ProtagonistA's tears and knew that ProtagonistB was telling ProtagonistA it was time to let ProtagonistB go 
 ProtagonistA stood up and leaned over ProtagonistB one last time 
  ProtagonistA love ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA whispered 
  Then ProtagonistA turned and walked out of the room , leaving ProtagonistB at peace 
ProtagonistA was not planning to marry , not until ProtagonistA had had ProtagonistA's fill of the immaculate manse 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a wild child and the thought of being tied down to one man and one house was not appealing 
 But then ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 Slowly but surely , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA falling in love with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was shocked but ProtagonistA said yes 
 And so , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA planning a wedding after all 
 But as ProtagonistA walked down the aisle towards ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had made the right decision 
ProtagonistA had been desirous of knowing what life would be like after ProtagonistA decided to have a baby , because ProtagonistA could not help but be curious , and had played the part of a constantly curious girl – uh … diary and all – in every conversation 
 ProtagonistA had read all the books and done all the research , but ProtagonistA still did n't feel like ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA was doing 
 Just thinking ,  ProtagonistA replied 
ProtagonistA was a baby when ProtagonistA heard the message , scarcely able even to sit up , but , in all probability , sitting still 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what they were , only that they were old and powerful and should not be disturbed 
 Hello ?  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's voice small and timid 
 ProtagonistA quailed under the weight of that voice , but ProtagonistA forced ProtagonistA to answer 
 ProtagonistA 'm just a baby 
 And yet ProtagonistA have the courage to speak to me 
 What do ProtagonistA want , ProtagonistA do n't know ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA just wanted to talk to someone 
 From this day forward , ProtagonistA will be able to understand the language of the birds and the animals 
 ProtagonistA will be able to understand the secrets of the plants and the trees 
 ProtagonistA will be able to understand the mysteries of the universe 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to make of what had just happened , but ProtagonistA knew that it was important 
 And so ProtagonistA would use the gift that ProtagonistA had been given , and ProtagonistA would learn all that ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA never thought ProtagonistA would see the man who killed ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to say something , but ProtagonistA could n't think of anything 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to be anywhere near ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA did n't want ProtagonistC to touch ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't want ProtagonistC to hurt ProtagonistA 
 You killed ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's voice shaking 
 You did n't mean to kill ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA repeated , ProtagonistA's voice rising 
 ProtagonistA jerked away from ProtagonistC , ProtagonistA's heart pounding 
  Do n't touch ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA turned and ran , not looking back 
 ProtagonistA had to get away from ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA had to warn the others 
ProtagonistA has always been a bright and happy person , despite the fact that ProtagonistB had a heart of stone 
 ProtagonistA never understood why ProtagonistB was so cold and distant , but ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB anyway 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was older , ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB why ProtagonistB was so hard - hearted 
 ProtagonistA hugged ProtagonistB and promised to never let ProtagonistB down 
 To this day , ProtagonistA still thinks of ProtagonistB and the pain ProtagonistB must have gone through in ProtagonistB's life 
 ProtagonistA is determined to never let ProtagonistA get hurt like that , and to always be there for the people ProtagonistA loves 
ProtagonistA had been planning ProtagonistA's second trip into the North Sea for months 
 ProtagonistA had saved up ProtagonistA's money and had even managed to find a boat that was willing to take ProtagonistA 
 On one gloomy day in April , ProtagonistA set sail 
 The journey was rough and ProtagonistA was seasick for most of it 
 But ProtagonistA was determined to reach ProtagonistA's destination 
 ProtagonistA had made it to the North Sea ! 
In the first place , ProtagonistA holds the door , but as ProtagonistA opens the door , you know ProtagonistA is going to be there 
 ProtagonistA is the one who is always there for you , the one who is always there to support you 
 ProtagonistA is your best friend 
 And you know that ProtagonistA will be there for you , no matter what 
ProtagonistA was in a tough spot 
 ProtagonistA had been praying for a solution to ProtagonistA's problem , but nothing had come to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was starting to feel desperate 
 ProtagonistA had tried everything ProtagonistA could think of , but nothing had worked 
 ProtagonistA was out of options 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA had an idea 
 ProtagonistA prayed for one last time , asking for a solution to ProtagonistA's problem 
 This time , ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace come over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA had to do 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and took the leap 
 ProtagonistA had no idea what would happen , but ProtagonistA was ready to face whatever came ProtagonistA's way 
ProtagonistA was one of the most popular women of ProtagonistA's day 
 ProtagonistA was beautiful , intelligent , and had a heart of gold 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were always doing something fun and exciting together 
 ProtagonistA and Bob 's love story came to a tragic end , however , when ProtagonistB passed away suddenly 
 ProtagonistA withdrew from society and became a recluse 
 ProtagonistA could n't bear to be around people anymore , as they reminded ProtagonistA too much of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA lived the rest of ProtagonistA's days alone , but ProtagonistA was content knowing that ProtagonistA had experienced the most perfect love story imaginable 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the edge of the water , eating a dinner of snowball peas and tarts , in the backyard of the house ProtagonistA had rented for the summer 
 It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was enjoying the peace and quiet of the small town ProtagonistA was in 
 ProtagonistA had just taken a bite of ProtagonistA's tart when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the other side of the water 
 ProtagonistA got up to see what it was , and saw a small boat coming towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA waved back , and ProtagonistB came ashore 
 ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistA's dinner , feeling happy that ProtagonistA had made ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a homebody , content to stay in ProtagonistA's small village and never venture too far from home 
 ProtagonistA was nervous but excited to be experiencing something new 
 As the guests chatter around ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA feels out of place and unsure of what to say 
 But then ProtagonistA notices ProtagonistB 
 Before long , ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA 's been transported back home , chatting away like ProtagonistA 's known ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's whole life 
 It 's only when ProtagonistB gets up to leave that ProtagonistA realizes ProtagonistA never even caught ProtagonistB's name 
 But in that moment , ProtagonistA feels grateful for ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA may have walked ProtagonistA's dog for a long time , but ProtagonistA had nothing to lose 
 ProtagonistA was bored out of ProtagonistA's mind and ProtagonistA's dog was the only thing keeping ProtagonistA sane 
 ProtagonistA had no friends , no family , and no life outside of ProtagonistA's job and ProtagonistA's dog 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to take ProtagonistA's dog for a walk and never came back 
 ProtagonistA left everything behind and started a new life with ProtagonistA's dog 
 ProtagonistA never looked back 
 ProtagonistA had a natural gift for color and composition , and ProtagonistB was very proud of ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was a widow who loved ProtagonistA's children very much 
 ProtagonistA was always there for them when they needed ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was always willing to help out in any way ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA agreed to take them and ProtagonistA packed up the car and drove them to the beach 
ProtagonistA had been drinking with ProtagonistA's husband and ProtagonistA's sister at a little inn in a certain town in the United States at the time when the great tempo of American industry was at an end 
 As ProtagonistA sat at the table , ProtagonistA felt a great sadness come over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that things would never be the same again 
ProtagonistA was sitting at ProtagonistA's dining room table in the picture room , watching with some interest as the door of ProtagonistA's second class compartment was pushed open 
 ProtagonistA had been on the train for hours , and was looking forward to finally getting off and stretching ProtagonistA's legs 
 However , as the door opened , ProtagonistA saw that there was ProtagonistB in the compartment with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was immediately on guard 
 ProtagonistA had heard stories of people being robbed on trains , and ProtagonistA did n't want to be the next victim 
 ProtagonistA reached for ProtagonistA's purse , but ProtagonistB was quicker 
 ProtagonistA had worked hard for that money , and now ProtagonistA was going to have to start all over again 
 ProtagonistA was determined to catch ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was going to make ProtagonistB pay 
ProtagonistA was a woman who loved animals 
 ProtagonistA had a hundred sheep and three horses 
 ProtagonistA was a kind and gentle person , and ProtagonistA's animals loved ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did everything ProtagonistA could to help them , but they continued to get worse 
Every Sunday , Father 's Day , ProtagonistA had the usual Sunday breakfast 
 ProtagonistA could n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but there was an excitement in the air that was palpable 
 What is it , Father ?  ProtagonistA asked , ProtagonistA's curiosity piqued 
 A gift ? What is it ?  ProtagonistA asked , now even more excited 
 ProtagonistA had always loved ProtagonistA's brother 's house and had often thought about how wonderful it would be to live there ProtagonistA one day 
ProtagonistA was walking to the door of ProtagonistA's aunt 's cabin when ProtagonistA heard the birds chirping 
 ProtagonistA smiled and went inside , where ProtagonistA was greeted by ProtagonistA's aunt and two cousins 
ProtagonistA was not sure if it was ProtagonistA's duty to help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was about to walk away when ProtagonistB spoke 
  ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment before ProtagonistA finally decided to help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's arm and helped ProtagonistB across the street 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful young woman with long blonde hair and blue eyes 
 ProtagonistA was very popular in ProtagonistA's school and had many friends 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking home from school with ProtagonistA's best friend , when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards them 
 ProtagonistA was very scared and ran away too 
 ProtagonistA ran home and told ProtagonistA's parents what had happened 
ProtagonistA went to bed in the morning , early , thinking of the presents ProtagonistA would be leaving ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had wrapped them all up and placed them under the tree , making sure ProtagonistB's name was on each one 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would be surprised and delighted when ProtagonistB opened them 
 ProtagonistA could n't wait to see the look on ProtagonistB's face 
ProtagonistA was a beautiful ship , and ProtagonistA's crew loved ProtagonistA dearly 
 ProtagonistA was the pride of the fleet , and everyone who saw ProtagonistA was in awe of ProtagonistA's beauty 
 On this particular night , ProtagonistA was in port , and the crew was taking advantage of the opportunity to rest and relax 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA began to move 
 ProtagonistA slowly made ProtagonistA's way out of the harbor and into the open sea 
ProtagonistA was lying on the floor on ProtagonistA's back , rocking back and forth , stretching out ProtagonistA's heels in the air 
 ProtagonistA was bored and there was nothing to do 
 ProtagonistA thought about getting up and doing something , but ProtagonistA was so comfortable lying there that ProtagonistA could n't be bothered 
 ProtagonistA looked around the room and saw the dust motes dancing in the sunlight that was streaming in through the window 
 ProtagonistA watched them for a while , until ProtagonistA started to feel sleepy 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and soon ProtagonistA was asleep 
ProtagonistA stood on the leadstaff of the slave ship and looked down at ProtagonistA's own bare feet 
 ProtagonistA had been on the ship for weeks , and it felt like a lifetime 
 One night , as ProtagonistA was lying in ProtagonistA's bunk , ProtagonistA heard a noise on deck 
 ProtagonistA got up to see what it was , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB climbing up the side of the ship 
 ProtagonistA was about to cry out for help , but ProtagonistA stopped ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB made ProtagonistB's way to the top of the ship , and then ProtagonistB jumped overboard 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA had been happy with the way things had been going in ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA felt that this was the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's early forties , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel ProtagonistA's age 
 ProtagonistA was no longer the fresh - faced young woman ProtagonistA used to be 
 ProtagonistA had wrinkles around ProtagonistA's eyes and mouth , and ProtagonistA's once - smooth skin was now starting to sag 
 But despite all of that , ProtagonistA was still a beautiful woman 
 And ProtagonistA was thankful for that 
 Because even though ProtagonistA was getting older , ProtagonistA still felt young at heart 
ProtagonistA was nine years old when ProtagonistA first heard of the death of ProtagonistA's father 
 ProtagonistA was playing in ProtagonistA's room when ProtagonistB came in and sat down on the edge of ProtagonistA's bed 
  ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA just sat there and stared at ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA , told it by ProtagonistA's uncle that ProtagonistA was six years old , sat in a room in the house and watched as the beetle made its landing in the greenery of a tall , dark , green tree 
 ProtagonistA watched as it crawled around in the leaves , disappearing from time to time 
 ProtagonistA wondered where it went and what it did when it was out of sight 
 After a while , ProtagonistA got up from ProtagonistA's seat and went to find ProtagonistA's uncle 
 Do you know what kind of beetle it is ?  ProtagonistA asked 
  ProtagonistA was amazed 
 ProtagonistA 've never seen anything like it before 
ProtagonistA had just gotten home from celebrating the New Year with ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's pajamas and was about to get into bed when ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA got up to investigate and saw ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's apartment 
ProtagonistA was a fine , cheerful , cheerful girl of fifteen years of age , who had a cheerful manner , and good sense , but no very good sense ; and though ProtagonistA was wo nt to be a good - humoured and a happy - go - lucky girl , ProtagonistA was not without a certain air of melancholy 
 ProtagonistA had never had a friend like ProtagonistB before , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA falling in love with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew it was wrong , but ProtagonistA could n't help it 
 ProtagonistA would daydream about ProtagonistB , imagining what it would be like to be ProtagonistB's wife 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to go on without ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was the happiest ProtagonistA had ever been 
 ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that they would be happy together forever 
ProtagonistA was three years old when ProtagonistA was brought to bay in the arms of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was scared and confused , but ProtagonistB was kind and gentle 
 ProtagonistB explained that ProtagonistB was there to help ProtagonistA and that ProtagonistA was safe now 
   I see ,  said the Doctor ,  and how do ProtagonistA know I can help ProtagonistA ?   ProtagonistA do n't ,  said ProtagonistA ,  but ProtagonistA 'm out of options 
One cold , gray November day , after a long winter 's heat , and a placid and happy season of summer , ProtagonistA , lay on ProtagonistA's bed in the green garden of ProtagonistA's maternal grandmother 's , thinking of the wholesome things that a well - ordered house could do for the comfort of the mind and body , without the extra expense of a large house , or a great purchase of land , or any other thing of the kind ; and in consequence of these wholesome things , the mind and body improved so much , that from the time that ProtagonistA was quite able to think , ProtagonistA could form any idea , no matter how dim and conflicting , regarding any particular object or thing , unless absolutely absolutely necessary ; and ProtagonistA thus became a very pretty , and very intelligent , and very happy woman , and saved ProtagonistA's family much distress , expense , and trouble , and earned in itself a considerable profit 
ProtagonistA sat down in the heather green armchair in ProtagonistA's little office and talked to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a successful businesswoman , but ProtagonistA always felt a little bit lonely 
 ProtagonistA had no one to talk to about ProtagonistA's day - to - day successes and struggles 
 But that was okay , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA did n't need anyone else 
ProtagonistA was sleeping and felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA woke up to find ProtagonistA in a dark room with no idea where ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA tried to stand up , but ProtagonistA's head was throbbing and ProtagonistA felt dizzy 
 ProtagonistA leaned against the wall and felt something wet and sticky 
 ProtagonistA put ProtagonistA's hand on it and brought it to ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA started to panic and tried to scream , but no sound came out 
 ProtagonistA banged on the door , but no one came 
ProtagonistA was always a tomboy 
 ProtagonistA loved playing sports and getting dirty 
 ProtagonistA loved the feeling of the sun on ProtagonistA's skin and the wind in ProtagonistA's hair 
 ProtagonistA saw a group of girls playing tag and ProtagonistA wanted to join in 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistA could , and ProtagonistB said yes 
 ProtagonistA ran over to the group of girls and asked if ProtagonistA could play 
 ProtagonistA was having so much fun 
 ProtagonistA was laughing and running and just enjoying ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to play anymore 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to go home 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB what the girl had said , and ProtagonistB just hugged ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 're a great player 
 And ProtagonistA 're a great person 
 ProtagonistA felt better after that , and ProtagonistA went out and played with ProtagonistA's friends again 
 And ProtagonistA never let anyone bring ProtagonistA down again 
ProtagonistA had always been a healthy man , so when ProtagonistA suddenly died on a day in 1812 , it came as a shock to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was always the one to help ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB was struggling , whether it was with school work or personal problems 
 Sadly , ProtagonistA lost ProtagonistA's battle with cancer a few months ago 
 Even though ProtagonistA is no longer with us , ProtagonistA will always be one of the greatest people ProtagonistB has ever known 
 ProtagonistA was a selfless person who always put others first , and ProtagonistB will never forget the impact ProtagonistA had on ProtagonistB's life 
ProtagonistA would never be the same again 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bright and happy person , but after what happened , ProtagonistA was changed 
 ProtagonistA would never again be the carefree girl ProtagonistA once was 
 ProtagonistA has since remained a loyal and true subject of ProtagonistB , and has never wavered in ProtagonistA's love and support for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's rule 
ProtagonistA was on the ocean liner , gazing out at the dark depths of the ocean 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could stare into the abyss forever 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's mother were riding in the back of a coach through the suburbs of New York 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA saw a rabbit running across the street 
 ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA jumped out of ProtagonistA's seat and pressed ProtagonistA's nose against the window to get a better look 
ProtagonistA preserved all ProtagonistA's memories in a jar on ProtagonistA's shelf 
 ProtagonistA would take them out and relive them often , happy to have something to hold on to from ProtagonistA's past 
 One day , ProtagonistA noticed that one of the memories was missing 
 ProtagonistA searched high and low , but it was nowhere to be found 
 ProtagonistA wondered if someone had taken it or if ProtagonistA had simply misplaced it 
 ProtagonistA would never know for sure , but ProtagonistA was determined to find out 
ProtagonistA was waiting at the airport for ProtagonistA's flight when ProtagonistA heard the crashing of small - arms fire and the effect of the machine gun 
 ProtagonistA quickly ducked down , trying to make ProtagonistA as small as possible 
 ProtagonistA could see the bullets tearing through the air , coming closer and closer to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and prayed that ProtagonistA would make it out alive 
 When the firing finally stopped , ProtagonistA cautiously opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw that ProtagonistA was surrounded by dead bodies 
 ProtagonistA was the only one who had made it 
 ProtagonistA quickly got up and ran to the nearest exit , trying to put as much distance between ProtagonistA and the carnage as possible 
 ProtagonistA would never forget what ProtagonistA had seen and heard today 
There was once ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was very little , and ProtagonistA was very passionate 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be a writer when ProtagonistA grew up , and ProtagonistA was always writing stories 
 ProtagonistA loved to read , and ProtagonistA would read anything ProtagonistA could get ProtagonistA's hands on 
 When ProtagonistA was ten , ProtagonistA wrote ProtagonistA's first novel , and it was published when ProtagonistA was twelve 
 ProtagonistA was a huge success , and ProtagonistA continued to write more novels 
 ProtagonistA became one of the most famous authors in the world , and ProtagonistA was loved by millions of people 
ProtagonistA was a kind and gentle woman who always tried to help others 
 ProtagonistA was always looking for ways to make a good buy , and ProtagonistA was always willing to help others 
 ProtagonistA died tragically in a car accident , but ProtagonistA's legacy lives on 
ProtagonistA was out exploring the jungle with ProtagonistA's friends when ProtagonistA stepped on a monkey 's foot 
 ProtagonistA went home that night and told ProtagonistA's parents what happened 
 It was the day ProtagonistA 'd first met them , the day ProtagonistA 'd first seen the world beyond ProtagonistA's small town 
 ProtagonistA 'd been so excited , so full of life 
 And ProtagonistA had believed them 
 But now , as ProtagonistA stood in front of them , ProtagonistA felt nothing but cold 
 ProtagonistA was no longer the girl they had met all those years ago 
 ProtagonistA was a woman now , and ProtagonistA knew the truth 
 ProtagonistA would never be one of them , no matter how much they tried to convince ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned and walked away , leaving them behind 
 ProtagonistA would never look back , never regret ProtagonistA's decision 
 From now on , ProtagonistA would only answer to ProtagonistA 
The last time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a man 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what to say , so ProtagonistA just asked ProtagonistB how ProtagonistB was doing 
 ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB , and they talked for a while about ProtagonistB's transition and how ProtagonistB was feeling 
ProtagonistA was walking home from getting groceries when ProtagonistA was suddenly grabbed from behind 
 ProtagonistA tried to scream , but it was muffled by the cloth 
 ProtagonistA tried to calm ProtagonistA down , but it was hard 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what was going to happen to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA would ever see ProtagonistA's family again 
 ProtagonistA spent the next few days in that room , with no food or water 
 ProtagonistA was starting to lose hope 
 ProtagonistA was starting to think that ProtagonistA would never be found 
 ProtagonistA was back where ProtagonistA had been kidnapped 
 ProtagonistA was confused and scared , but also relieved 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what had happened , but ProtagonistA was just glad to be back home 
The first time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB dead , ProtagonistA felt the dread of death wash over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was at ProtagonistB's bedside when ProtagonistB passed away 
 ProtagonistA held ProtagonistB's hand and cried as ProtagonistA watched the life leave ProtagonistB's body 
 In that moment , ProtagonistA felt the dread of death for the first time 
 ProtagonistA realized that one day ProtagonistA would die too 
 ProtagonistA vowed to live each day to the fullest and to make ProtagonistB proud 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the corner of the sofa , with ProtagonistA's head resting on the edge of the sofa , when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the kitchen 
 ProtagonistA slowly got up and tip - toed towards the kitchen , only to find ProtagonistB , knocking over a vase 
 ProtagonistA scolded ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB ran off into the living room 
 ProtagonistA sighed and went back to ProtagonistA's spot on the sofa , only to be startled by a knock at the door 
 ProtagonistA got up to answer it , only to find no one there 
 ProtagonistA shrugged and went back to the living room , where ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB sleeping on the sofa 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and went to bed , only to be woken up by a noise in the kitchen 
 ProtagonistA got up and tip - toed towards the kitchen , only to find ProtagonistB , knocking over a vase 
 ProtagonistA scolded ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB ran off into the living room 
 ProtagonistA sighed and went back to ProtagonistA's spot on the sofa , only to be startled by a knock at the door 
 ProtagonistA got up to answer it , only to find no one there 
 ProtagonistA shrugged and went back to the living room , where ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB sleeping on the sofa 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and went to bed 
 ProtagonistA saw a light in the distance and walked towards it 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA saw that it was a campfire 
 ProtagonistA put out a soft smile that had the air of a quarter and walked towards the fire 
ProtagonistA is so rich that ProtagonistA sleeps in ProtagonistA's own bed every night 
 ProtagonistA has so much money that ProtagonistA does n't know what to do with it all 
 ProtagonistA lives in a huge house and has all the latest gadgets 
 ProtagonistA is always buying new clothes and shoes 
 ProtagonistA has a personal shopper who helps ProtagonistA pick out the perfect outfits 
 ProtagonistA is truly living the life of luxury 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw a man walking hand in hand with a dead man 
 ProtagonistA felt a strong urge to help , but ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to get involved , but ProtagonistA could n't just walk away 
 ProtagonistA decided to follow them and see what they were up to 
 As ProtagonistA followed them , ProtagonistA saw the man stop and talk to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had made the right decision and ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had followed ProtagonistA's instinct 
 But ProtagonistA was a strong woman , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to be strong for ProtagonistA's children 
 ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to provide for Susan and Jethro , but it was difficult 
 ProtagonistA was grateful when ProtagonistA's brother , Joseph , offered to let them live in his tower 
 ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to tell them stories about ProtagonistB , but it was hard 
 ProtagonistA knew that they deserved to know the truth about ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA also knew that it would be too painful for them to hear 
 One day , ProtagonistA made the decision to tell Susan and Jethro the truth about ProtagonistB's death 
 And ProtagonistA knew that , no matter what , ProtagonistA would always be there for Susan and Jethro 
 ProtagonistA was staring up at the sky , wondering what ProtagonistA's life would be like if ProtagonistA could just float away 
 ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer , and this was ProtagonistA's favorite place to escape to 
 ProtagonistA would lie here for hours , letting ProtagonistA's mind wander to far off places 
 Sometimes ProtagonistA would imagine ProtagonistA was a bird , soaring through the sky , free from all ProtagonistA's troubles 
 Other times ProtagonistA would be ProtagonistB , being whisked away by ProtagonistB's prince charming 
 No matter where ProtagonistA's mind went , ProtagonistA always felt at peace when ProtagonistA was lying here 
 Even though ProtagonistA's friends teased ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA knew that they were just jealous 
One day in August , a winter in the West , ProtagonistA came to a village to pick up ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistA's father 's head and down at ProtagonistA's feet and said  ProtagonistB , go on 
  Then ProtagonistA walked away , leaving ProtagonistA's father behind 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was supposed to do or where ProtagonistA was supposed to go , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA walked for what felt like hours , until ProtagonistA finally came to a stop in front of a large door 
 ProtagonistA knocked and waited , but there was no answer 
 ProtagonistA knocked again , louder this time , and still there was no answer 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up and turn away when the door finally opened 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA spoke up 
 ProtagonistA should go there and look for ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistC and then ProtagonistA set off into the forest 
 ProtagonistA walked for what felt like hours , calling out for ProtagonistB , but there was no answer 
 ProtagonistA was just about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA followed the voice until ProtagonistA came to a clearing 
 There , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , waiting for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been sleepwalking again 
 It was something that ProtagonistA had done since ProtagonistA was a child and it always scared ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA gazed up at the sky , ProtagonistA's pale face illuminated by the soft light of the stars 
 ProtagonistA felt so small compared to the vastness of the universe , but ProtagonistA found comfort in knowing that ProtagonistA was a part of something so much bigger 
 ProtagonistA watched as the stars twinkled and danced in the night sky , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's worries start to dissipate 
 For a moment , ProtagonistA forgot ProtagonistA's troubles and just enjoyed the beauty of the night sky 
ProtagonistA sat up all night , and thought about all the things ProtagonistA had seen 
 ProtagonistA thought about the White Rabbit , and the Mad Hatter , and the Cheshire Cat 
 ProtagonistA thought about the Queen of Hearts , and the Jabberwocky 
 ProtagonistA thought about all the strange and wonderful things ProtagonistA had seen in Wonderland , and ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could see them again 
 ProtagonistA was a young woman who had been travelling on a ship with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had no food or water and ProtagonistA soon became very ill 
 On the second of April , ProtagonistA died of cholera 
 ProtagonistA was just seventeen years old 
 ProtagonistA died a painful death , all alone and far from home 
  ProtagonistA had come to say goodbye to ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA was also happy for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door , and ProtagonistB came to answer it 
 As ProtagonistA walked away , ProtagonistA looked back at the house one last time 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB , or the time they had spent together 
ProtagonistA was walking home from ProtagonistA's friend 's house when ProtagonistA dropped ProtagonistA's bag of toys on the ground 
 ProtagonistA looked up and saw a brick - and - mortar window with a two - foot - high gap in it 
 ProtagonistA could see into the house and saw a man and a woman arguing 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , so ProtagonistA just stood there and watched 
 ProtagonistA was the only child of ProtagonistA's parents , and they were very proud of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful baby , and grew into a beautiful young woman 
 ProtagonistA had a happy childhood , and was loved by all who knew ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA met a young man named Pierre , who was the son of a wealthy family 
 ProtagonistA was a devoted wife and mother , and the years passed happily for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a strong woman , and ProtagonistA did not let ProtagonistA's husband 's death break ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA raised ProtagonistA's children by ProtagonistA , and they grew up to be good and honest people 
 ProtagonistA was proud of them , and loved them dearly 
 As the years went by , ProtagonistA began to feel lonely 
 ProtagonistA had never remarried , and ProtagonistA's children were grown and had families of their own 
 ProtagonistA was happy for them , but ProtagonistA missed having someone to share ProtagonistA's life with 
 One day , ProtagonistA went to visit ProtagonistA's parents ' grave 
 ProtagonistA had not been there for many years , and ProtagonistA was surprised to see that the headstone had been replaced 
 On it , ProtagonistA read the following words:Alice , ProtagonistA were the light of our lives 
 ProtagonistA will be forever in our hearts 
 ProtagonistA was no longer alone , and ProtagonistA knew that they would always be with ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been drinking with ProtagonistB all evening , and ProtagonistA had been told to go to bed early , for ProtagonistA was going to spend all night with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA decided to drink some more of ProtagonistB's liquor , and ProtagonistA ended up passing out ProtagonistA 
 The next morning , ProtagonistA woke up with a headache and ProtagonistB was nowhere to be found 
 ProtagonistA had no idea what had happened to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was starting to worry 
When ProtagonistA had finally finished reading the story aloud to the two children , ProtagonistA had gone over the whole thing again , and felt more than ever that ProtagonistA had gone astray , to the extreme extent of the past 
 ProtagonistA had been so careful , and yet ProtagonistA had not been able to help ProtagonistA 
 The story had been so interesting , and ProtagonistA had been so eager to get to the end , that ProtagonistA had rushed on , without paying proper attention to what ProtagonistA was doing 
 And now the result was plain to ProtagonistA ; ProtagonistA had not only gone wrong ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA had led the two children astray as well 
ProtagonistA was a blonde girl with long black hair , and while ProtagonistA knew it was only a possibility that ProtagonistA would one day be all of thirty - two , it did n't matter 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life and did n't want anything to change 
 ProtagonistA had a great job , a loving family , and a comfortable life 
 At first , ProtagonistA was in denial 
 ProtagonistA refused to believe that this was happening to ProtagonistA 
 But as the days went by , ProtagonistA started to accept ProtagonistA's fate 
 ProtagonistA made a bucket list of all the things ProtagonistA wanted to do before ProtagonistA died 
 And ProtagonistA set out to do them all 
 ProtagonistA went on amazing adventures , made new friends , and experienced life in a way ProtagonistA never had before 
 In the end , ProtagonistA died happy and fulfilled , knowing that ProtagonistA had lived ProtagonistA's life to the fullest 
ProtagonistA was a very kind and well - mannered young woman who always tried to do ProtagonistA's best to be polite and friendly to everyone ProtagonistA met 
 ProtagonistA lived in a small country town and was always of the opinion that ProtagonistA had great moral and intellectual advantages over ProtagonistA's neighbours 
 ProtagonistA believed that the best way to enjoy these advantages was to treat ProtagonistA's neighbours with the utmost civility and affability 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking around ProtagonistA's neighbourhood when ProtagonistA came across a group of children who were playing in the street 
 ProtagonistA decided to ask ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB thought the problem might be 
 From then on , ProtagonistA made it a point to be extra friendly to the children in ProtagonistA's neighbourhood and ProtagonistA soon became their favourite person 
 ProtagonistA would always stop to chat with them and ProtagonistA would always bring them treats 
 ProtagonistA was happy to know that ProtagonistA had made a difference in the lives of the children in ProtagonistA's neighbourhood and ProtagonistA was proud to know that ProtagonistA was respected and loved by them 
ProtagonistA 's coming 
 ProtagonistA 's coming to my room 
 ProtagonistA 's coming in 
 ProtagonistA 's coming to me 
ProtagonistA was seated on the steps of the throne in the center of the court , ProtagonistA's face pale and ProtagonistA's eyes trembling as ProtagonistA looked down at the golden blade of Agredite in the hands of the man ProtagonistA was about to marry 
 ProtagonistA knew that this was the only way to save ProtagonistA's kingdom from the war that was ravaging the land , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like ProtagonistA was being sacrificed 
 As the man raised the blade , ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and said a silent prayer , hoping that this would all be over quickly 
 ProtagonistA will go to ProtagonistA's room and stay there until I say ProtagonistA can come out 
 ProtagonistA felt the tears welling up in ProtagonistA's eyes , but ProtagonistA refused to give ProtagonistA's aunt the satisfaction of seeing them fall 
 Once ProtagonistA was inside , ProtagonistA allowed ProtagonistA to collapse onto the bed and cry 
 ProtagonistA was so tired of ProtagonistA's aunt 's abuse , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to escape it 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice outside ProtagonistA's window 
  ProtagonistA , climb out onto the roof and ProtagonistB 'll take ProtagonistA away from here 
 ProtagonistA looked out to see ProtagonistB standing on the edge of the roof 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to trust ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA climbed out the window and onto the roof 
 As they left , ProtagonistA looked back at ProtagonistA's aunt 's house , feeling relieved that ProtagonistA was finally free 
ProtagonistA stepped to the lectern and ProtagonistB did not interrupt ProtagonistA's position 
 ProtagonistA began to speak , but ProtagonistA was so nervous that ProtagonistA's words came out in a jumble 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and began again 
 ProtagonistA talked about ProtagonistA's passion for writing and how ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a writer 
ProtagonistA was fifteen when ProtagonistA walked into the shopper 's window of the stockade at Nightingale 's Gate , and into the room that was always there , and out of the dark , dusty floors 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it before , and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA had never seen anything so beautiful 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , so ProtagonistA just stood there , staring at the beautiful people and the beautiful room 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA did n't know , and ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA wanted to come with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA nodded , and ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB out of the room and into the stockade 
ProtagonistA was increasing in stature 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful , cat - faced creature , but most people would admit that ProtagonistA was rather strange 
 ProtagonistA had a habit of appearing out of nowhere and then disappearing just as quickly 
 One day , ProtagonistA appeared in a small town 
 ProtagonistA walked through the town , looking at the people and the buildings 
 ProtagonistA seemed to be searching for something 
 ProtagonistA came to a stop in front of a large building 
  ProtagonistA went inside 
 ProtagonistA walked towards the voices and peered inside 
 ProtagonistA could see that they were worried about something 
 ProtagonistA just smiled and said that ProtagonistA was looking for something 
 ProtagonistA just sat in ProtagonistA's cell , smiling to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would find what ProtagonistA was looking for soon 
ProtagonistA's name was Lucy , and ProtagonistA was just seventeen when we first met 
 I was twenty - one , and I thought ProtagonistA was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen 
 ProtagonistA had long , dark hair and bright blue eyes , and ProtagonistA was always laughing 
 So , one day , ProtagonistA gathered ProtagonistA's courage and dove into the deep 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was finally home 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA came to a small nook of earth and air , filled to the top with the fragrance of flowers and the fragrance of the wind 
ProtagonistA was walking through the great halls of the castle on that snowy morning in March 
 ProtagonistA came face to face with ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistA 'm just exploring 
  ProtagonistA are not welcome here 
 I'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA did n't mean to intrude 
  ProtagonistA are not safe here 
 Why ?  ProtagonistA asked 
  ProtagonistA must go 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to go , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and turned to leave 
 As ProtagonistA walked away , ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB say ,  Be careful , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA are not alone in this world 
 ProtagonistA asked for guidance in establishing ProtagonistA's religion and assembling ProtagonistA's companions in the city 
 ProtagonistA wanted to know what mode would be most proper for ProtagonistA to take 
ProtagonistA is sitting alone in a hospital bed , across the way from ProtagonistA's home 
 ProtagonistA is feeling lonely and scared 
 ProtagonistA 's just about to drift off to sleep when ProtagonistA hears a voice 
  ProtagonistA turns to see a woman standing next to ProtagonistA's bed 
 Who are you ?  ProtagonistA asks 
 ProtagonistA is surprised 
  ProtagonistA did n't know ProtagonistA had a guardian angel 
 And with that , ProtagonistA feels a sense of peace wash over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA 's not alone anymore 
ProtagonistA was a well - built , long - legged , very pretty , pretty girl with a certain childlike air of innocence about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been dating ProtagonistC for a few months and they were very happy together 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out with ProtagonistA's girlfriends when ProtagonistA ran into ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was flattered by the attention but ProtagonistA did n't want to cheat on ProtagonistC , so ProtagonistA politely declined 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA gave in and they slept together 
 ProtagonistA felt guilty afterwards but ProtagonistA rationalized it by telling ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC would never find out 
ProtagonistA considered ProtagonistA the luckiest woman alive 
 ProtagonistA had a loving family , a beautiful home , and a successful career 
 However , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA did n't have everything 
 ProtagonistA was missing one important thing : a partner 
 ProtagonistA had never been in a relationship and ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA was the only one who was single 
 ProtagonistA wanted to find someone to share ProtagonistA's life with , but ProtagonistA did n't know where to start 
 One day , ProtagonistA went online and started looking for dating websites 
 ProtagonistA found one that looked promising and decided to give it a try 
 ProtagonistA created a profile and started browsing through the other members 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB and sent ProtagonistB a message 
 They 've been together ever since and ProtagonistA has never been happier 
 It 's a beautiful day , is n't it?Yes , it is ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA 've been wanting to talk to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA wanted to apologize ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA 've just been going through a lot 
 ProtagonistA hugged ProtagonistB tightly , relieved that ProtagonistB had forgiven ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been in ProtagonistA's cell for two days now 
 ProtagonistA was innocent , but no one believed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was all alone 
 On the second day of ProtagonistA's incarceration , ProtagonistA could n't bear to get up from the bed ProtagonistA had been lying on for hours 
 ProtagonistA stayed in ProtagonistA's room for a few minutes , and then , without saying a word , ProtagonistA took one last deep breath and , as if nothing happened , let ProtagonistA go 
ProtagonistA is a young girl who lives in a small town 
 ProtagonistA is an only child and ProtagonistA's parents are always busy with work 
 ProtagonistA is a very lonely girl 
 ProtagonistA tells it everything 
 ProtagonistA tells it ProtagonistA's secrets , ProtagonistA's hopes , and ProtagonistA's dreams 
 ProtagonistA is very excited 
 ProtagonistA ca n't wait to talk to the moon 
 ProtagonistA goes outside and sits in ProtagonistA's backyard 
 ProtagonistA looks up at the moon and starts to speak 
 ProtagonistA have so much to tell you 
 ProtagonistA made ProtagonistB today 
 ProtagonistA hope we can be friends forever 
 ProtagonistA continues to talk to the moon 
 ProtagonistA tells it about ProtagonistA's day and what ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA feels so happy and content 
 ProtagonistA feels like the moon is ProtagonistA's best friend 
 ProtagonistA had been reading about the ancient practice of necromancy and was fascinated by the idea of talking to the dead 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner , and the thought of being able to communicate with those who had passed on was irresistible 
 So , one night , ProtagonistA went out to the graveyard with a candle and a book of spells 
 ProtagonistA was not sure if it would work , but ProtagonistA was determined to try 
 ProtagonistA lit the candle and began to read the spell 
 ProtagonistA was also able to find out about ProtagonistA's own future 
 From then on , ProtagonistA devoted ProtagonistA to the study of necromancy and became one of the most famous practitioners of the art 
 ProtagonistA was a young woman of nineteen , living in a small town in England 
 ProtagonistA had two brothers , one of whom was studying at university and the other was in the army 
 ProtagonistA was a very pretty girl , with dark hair and blue eyes 
 ProtagonistA was very shy and introverted , but ProtagonistA was also very intelligent and well - read 
 ProtagonistA loved to read , and ProtagonistA's dream was to one day write a book of ProtagonistA's own 
 One day , ProtagonistA received a letter from ProtagonistB , asking ProtagonistA to come and visit ProtagonistB in London 
 ProtagonistA was very excited , and ProtagonistA immediately packed ProtagonistA's bags and set off for the city 
 ProtagonistA arrived in London and was met by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was amazed by the sights and sounds of the city , and ProtagonistA quickly fell in love with it 
 ProtagonistA spent the next few days exploring London with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA soon realized that ProtagonistA could never go back to ProtagonistA's small town life 
 ProtagonistA had never been so happy in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was happy to finally be living ProtagonistA's dream life in the city 
 ProtagonistA was miserable , and ProtagonistA began to regret ever marrying ProtagonistC 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided enough was enough 
 ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and left ProtagonistC , vowing never to return 
 ProtagonistA moved back in with ProtagonistB and started to build a new life for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was finally free , and ProtagonistA was never going to let anyone control ProtagonistA again 
ProtagonistA had always been a bright girl 
 ProtagonistA was at the top of ProtagonistA's class and had always been told that ProtagonistA was destined for great things 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life the way it was and did n't see the need to further ProtagonistA's education 
 ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB but also felt a twinge of jealousy 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to go to college but had never had the opportunity 
  ProtagonistA 'm really happy for ProtagonistB 
 I know ProtagonistA always wanted to go to college , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment before answering 
  ProtagonistA did n't want to be thought of as dumb ,  ProtagonistA said finally 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 're not dumb 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been holding ProtagonistA back out of fear of what others might think 
 Thank ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA might apply to college after all 
 And with that , ProtagonistA took the first step towards fulfilling ProtagonistA's lifelong dream 
The day after ProtagonistA's engagement as an actress , ProtagonistA had a severe headache , and had to walk at all hours 
 ProtagonistA was sure that it was just the nerves and would go away soon 
 ProtagonistA decided to go to the hospital to get checked out 
 ProtagonistA is grateful that ProtagonistA went to the hospital when ProtagonistA did , as it likely saved ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA is a young girl who lives in a small town 
 ProtagonistA is an only child and ProtagonistA's parents are very strict 
 One day , ProtagonistA finds a box in ProtagonistA's attic which contains a beautiful dress 
 ProtagonistA puts on the dress and goes outside 
 ProtagonistA meets ProtagonistB and follows ProtagonistB down a rabbit hole 
 ProtagonistA has many adventures in this strange place 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA returns home 
 ProtagonistA is very sad 
 However , ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA can return to ProtagonistA's magical place whenever ProtagonistA wants 
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA saw a strange light in the distance 
 ProtagonistA walked towards it and saw that it was a fire 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA saw that there was a strange light in the fire , as if it was burning with a different kind of heat 
 ProtagonistA walked closer and saw that there was a creature in the fire 
 The dragon spoke to ProtagonistA in a language ProtagonistA had never heard before 
 ProtagonistA was scared at first , but the dragon was friendly and soon they were talking and laughing like old friends 
When ProtagonistA was seven and ProtagonistA had nothing to do , ProtagonistA sat down on the floor of ProtagonistA's father 's bedroom and read a book , with a book in the lap of ProtagonistA's hand , holding the pages up against the light , and the light has never been the same again 
 ProtagonistA finished the book and sat there for a while , thinking about what ProtagonistA had just read 
 It was then that ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA could be anything ProtagonistA wanted to be , and ProtagonistA was never going to let anyone tell ProtagonistA what to do ever again 
 From that day on , ProtagonistA was a different person 
 ProtagonistA was more confident and sure of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could achieve anything ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to 
ProtagonistA had been waiting on ProtagonistA's perch for days , watching and waiting for ProtagonistA's chance 
 ProtagonistA had seen the sun come up and go down , and the moon wax and wane , but ProtagonistA had never seen anything like this 
 ProtagonistA sprang out of ProtagonistA's perch with a great voice and began to fly 
 ProtagonistA soared through the sky , higher and higher , until ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA could touch the sun 
 ProtagonistA flew around it , feeling its warmth on ProtagonistA's wings , and then ProtagonistA flew back to ProtagonistA's perch to rest 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget this day , when ProtagonistA saw the sun and the moon both shining bright in the sky 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the veranda of the front door with ProtagonistA's hands on the knob 
 ProtagonistA was about to go inside when ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA got up and followed the noise 
 ProtagonistA opened it and saw ProtagonistB crying 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's way home 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's hand and they started to walk 
 ProtagonistA walked with ProtagonistB to the house and knocked on the door 
 ProtagonistA was awaiting the publication of ProtagonistA's work , which was entitled A History of the World 
 ProtagonistA determined to devote to the study of it all that was worthy of ProtagonistA's mind and to the satisfaction of the human race 
 However , before ProtagonistA could do so , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's family fell ill 
 ProtagonistA had been so looking forward to today 
  ProtagonistA did n't see what was so wrong with ProtagonistA's faith , but ProtagonistA's mother insisted 
 As ProtagonistA scanned the pages of the bible , ProtagonistA began to feel a bit guilty 
 Maybe ProtagonistA's mother was right , maybe ProtagonistA did need to find ProtagonistA's faith 
 After all , what did ProtagonistA know about birds ? ProtagonistA knew they could fly , but that was about it 
ProtagonistA sits cross - legged on the floor of the dark alcove , ProtagonistA's fingers tracing the lines of a small painting 
 ProtagonistA ca n't see ProtagonistB's face , but ProtagonistA can feel ProtagonistB's pain 
 ProtagonistA feels ProtagonistB's pain , and ProtagonistA wants to help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA does n't know how , but ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA has to try 
ProtagonistA had been a sailor for many years , and ProtagonistA was very comfortable on ProtagonistA's ship 
 ProtagonistA had been in many storms and had never been afraid 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to get off the ship , so ProtagonistA climbed into a lifeboat 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was on a beach , and ProtagonistA's ship was gone 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , so ProtagonistA just sat there until someone found ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was on the eve of the most important visit of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was to meet the family of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was very nervous and excited about the meeting 
 ProtagonistA had heard so much about the family and was very curious to meet them 
 The next day , ProtagonistA met the family and was immediately impressed 
 ProtagonistA had a wonderful time with the family and was very sad to say goodbye when the time came 
 However , ProtagonistA was very grateful for the experience and the memories ProtagonistA had made 
 Even though ProtagonistA was different , ProtagonistA never felt like an outsider 
 ProtagonistA was always confident and comfortable in ProtagonistA's own skin 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was out exploring the woods near ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA came across a beautiful butterfly 
 ProtagonistA was so amazed by it that ProtagonistA reached out to touch it 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had been given a special gift 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was always with ProtagonistA , even when ProtagonistA was exploring new places 
ProtagonistA was in the middle of a heated battle with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so focused on the battle that ProtagonistA did n't see ProtagonistB's henchman sneaking up behind ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been thinking all night and ProtagonistA 'd been stumped ever since 
 ProtagonistA just could n't seem to figure out what ProtagonistA wanted to do with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had always been good at school and ProtagonistA had always been told that ProtagonistA was smart , but ProtagonistA just did n't know what ProtagonistA wanted to do with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA thought about becoming a doctor or a lawyer , but ProtagonistA just could n't decide 
 ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA was never going to figure it out when ProtagonistA finally fell asleep 
ProtagonistA had driven for an entire day , and a whole day 's sleep , and had done nothing of note save to be driven to the place ProtagonistA was going to be raped 
 ProtagonistA had been planning to stop at a hotel for the night , but ProtagonistB had other plans 
 ProtagonistA was able to make it back to civilization , but ProtagonistA was forever changed by the ordeal 
ProtagonistA had been very wrong in ProtagonistA's belief that I would ever be with anyone , or marry anyone 
 ProtagonistA had seen me with many different women , and ProtagonistA knew that I was not the type to settle down 
 ProtagonistA was wrong 
ProtagonistA was sitting at ProtagonistA's typewriter , studying the words typed on the screen 
 ProtagonistA was trying to decide if ProtagonistA should keep going or not 
 ProtagonistA had been working on this story for weeks , and it just was n't coming together the way ProtagonistA wanted 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door 
 ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and there was ProtagonistB there with a package 
 ProtagonistA signed for it and took it inside 
 ProtagonistA opened it and found a typewriter just like ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA sat down and started typing 
 ProtagonistA sat back and smiled 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had made the right decision to keep going 
ProtagonistA was walking through the turnip bush when ProtagonistA was confronted by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA had ever seen ProtagonistB before , but ProtagonistB seemed familiar 
 ProtagonistA was getting tired and ProtagonistB offered to carry ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistA eventually agreed 
 ProtagonistA was so grateful and thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's help 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the shadow of the building , and ProtagonistA's eyes had the kind of serenity of a few hours spent in a convincing dream 
 ProtagonistA felt at peace 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately and needed a break 
  And then ProtagonistA would go on to describe how ProtagonistA would have managed things better 
  ProtagonistA would have done this , and ProtagonistA would have done that ,  ProtagonistA would say 
 But when it came to actual practice , ProtagonistA was not nearly so successful 
 ProtagonistA would make a plan for doing something , and then ProtagonistA would forget all about it 
 Or ProtagonistA would start to do something , and then ProtagonistA would get distracted and not finish it 
 So , in spite of ProtagonistA's habit of making speeches , ProtagonistA was not really very good at getting things done 
ProtagonistA has always considered ProtagonistA a strong , independent woman 
 So , when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was the one for ProtagonistA 
 So , when ProtagonistA marries ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA 's finally found ProtagonistA's true self 
ProtagonistA has never been to the movies before , but ProtagonistA 's always been involved in them 
 Yesterday , ProtagonistA finally got ProtagonistA's chance 
 ProtagonistA went to the movies with ProtagonistA's friends , and ProtagonistA loved it 
 ProtagonistA loved it all 
 ProtagonistA even got to see ProtagonistA's favorite movie ,  The Lion King  , which made the experience even better 
 ProtagonistA had a great time at the movies , and ProtagonistA ca n't wait to go back 
 ProtagonistA 's glad ProtagonistA finally got the chance to experience it , and ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA 'll be back for more 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who loved to explore 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole and decided to follow it 
 ProtagonistA ended up in ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had many adventures in ProtagonistB and made many new friends 
 ProtagonistA even met a talking cat ! Eventually , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's way back home and ProtagonistA was very happy to be reunited with ProtagonistA's family 
ProtagonistA was sailing to San Diego , California in a boat which ProtagonistA called the Lusitania 
 ProtagonistA was particularly delighted at the prospect of a private audience with the rich and famous 
 Fortunately , ProtagonistA was an excellent swimmer and was able to make it to shore 
 ProtagonistA was wet , cold , and exhausted , but otherwise unharmed 
ProtagonistA ran with alacrity through several miles of fields , forests , and meadows , bearing with ProtagonistA the great stuff of life : the apple , the bramble , the cherry - tree , the thorn - trees , and so many trees , some two hundred yards in circumference 
 ProtagonistA had been running for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting tired 
 But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 ProtagonistA had to find the place where the trees stopped 
  ProtagonistA had never seen grass before , but ProtagonistA had heard that it was soft and green and smelled good 
 ProtagonistA was hoping that ProtagonistA would find this place soon 
 Finally , ProtagonistA came to a clearing 
 ProtagonistA stopped and looked at the tree 
 It was so big ! ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA quickly hid behind the tree and waited 
 ProtagonistA could see movement through the trees , and then ProtagonistA saw a person 
 ProtagonistA slowly came out from behind the tree 
  ProtagonistA's name is Alice ,  ProtagonistA said 
  Where are ProtagonistA going?I'm looking for the place where the trees stop ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB through the trees 
 ProtagonistA looked around 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it ! It was so beautiful ! ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it 
 Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA had been feeling off for a while 
 ProtagonistA was tired all the time and ProtagonistA's joints were aching 
 ProtagonistA thought it was just a phase ProtagonistA was going through and did n't think much of it 
 But when ProtagonistA started to get short of breath and started to see spots in ProtagonistA's vision , ProtagonistA knew something was n't right 
 ProtagonistA made an appointment to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had high blood pressure and was in the early stages of dementia 
 It was a lot to take in , but ProtagonistA was grateful to have a diagnosis and a plan to help ProtagonistA manage ProtagonistA's condition 
ProtagonistA was a very old , very fat king who lived in a deep , dark corner of the universe 
 ProtagonistA was so old and so fat that ProtagonistA could barely move 
 ProtagonistA are so old and so fat that ProtagonistA can barely move 
 ProtagonistA thought about this for a while and then said ,  You are right , ProtagonistA's subjects 
 ProtagonistA should see a doctor 
 ProtagonistA will go see the doctor tomorrow 
 The next day , ProtagonistA went to see the doctor 
 ProtagonistA are so old and so fat that ProtagonistA can barely move 
 ProtagonistA thought about this for a while and then said ,  You are right , doctor 
 ProtagonistA will diet and exercise 
 And so ProtagonistA began ProtagonistA's diet and exercise program 
 ProtagonistA dieted and ProtagonistA exercised and ProtagonistA slowly began to lose weight 
 As ProtagonistA lost weight , ProtagonistA became more active and more able to move 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA was able to move around quite well 
ProtagonistA was well past the age of twenty when ProtagonistA found the way to hell 
 ProtagonistA had always been a curious girl , and ProtagonistA was always looking for new adventures 
 When ProtagonistA found a map that showed the way to hell , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to find it 
 ProtagonistA could feel the heat of the flames as ProtagonistA walked into the cave 
 ProtagonistA could also hear the screams of the damned as they were being tortured 
 ProtagonistA walked through the cave until ProtagonistA came to a large door 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and walked into hell 
ProtagonistA was in a large room on the first floor 
 ProtagonistA was afraid of what might happen if ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to be the cause of any more conflict 
 ProtagonistA would stay in the room and hope for the best 
ProtagonistA had already been through a lot in ProtagonistA's young life 
 ProtagonistA had been through the so - called  fatal stages  of ProtagonistA's career , and had come out the other side 
 ProtagonistA was a strong woman , and ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA had to do 
 ProtagonistA would go it alone 
 ProtagonistA would find the real source of the calamity , and ProtagonistA would expose it 
 ProtagonistA would not rest until ProtagonistA had justice 
 ProtagonistA was a woman on a mission 
 ProtagonistA was going to get to the bottom of this , and ProtagonistA was going to make sure that justice was served 
ProtagonistA has been working in the fields of London for a very long time , and of all the police officers here , to which ProtagonistA belongs , none , neither male nor female , is a match for anybody else 
 ProtagonistA 's the best of the best , and ProtagonistA's skills have been honed through years of experience 
 ProtagonistA 's the only one who stands a chance of catching them , and ProtagonistA wo n't rest until the job is done 
 ProtagonistA was also very smart , and could read and write better than most adults 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was out playing with ProtagonistA's friends , ProtagonistA found a rabbit hole 
 ProtagonistA was curious , so ProtagonistA decided to follow the rabbit down the hole 
 ProtagonistA ended up in ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was very curious about ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA met all sorts of interesting creatures 
 ProtagonistA even met the Queen of Hearts , who was not very nice 
 But ProtagonistA was not afraid , and ProtagonistA eventually made ProtagonistA's way back home 
 ProtagonistA was happy to oblige , and ProtagonistA told them everything that had happened 
 ProtagonistA even showed them the pictures ProtagonistA had drawn of all the creatures ProtagonistA had met 
 ProtagonistA believed them , and ProtagonistA went on to have many more adventures 
 ProtagonistA even wrote a book about ProtagonistA's experiences in ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was a very special girl , and ProtagonistA will always be remembered for ProtagonistA's amazing adventure 
ProtagonistA was walking through town on the left hand side of the road when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA wondered if ProtagonistB was a boy or a girl 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB's name was 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who lived in a small town 
 ProtagonistA was very shy and never spoke to anyone 
 One day , ProtagonistA saw a rabbit in ProtagonistA's garden and followed it into a hole 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a strange place where ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden where ProtagonistA met a handsome prince 
ProtagonistA had been in prison for years , and ProtagonistA was getting tired of it 
 ProtagonistA was planning to escape , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to be careful 
 ProtagonistA had to be quiet and not attract attention to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA crept out of ProtagonistA's cell and made ProtagonistA's way through the prison , avoiding the guards 
 ProtagonistA was getting closer and closer to the exit , and ProtagonistA could see the light of freedom 
 But then , ProtagonistA heard someone coming , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had been caught 
And then there was ProtagonistA , and it was as if ProtagonistA had been born with a soul , and it was as if ProtagonistA had been born to be a dead man , and it was as though ProtagonistA had been born in the middle of the desert , and it was as though ProtagonistA had been born in the dead of winter , and it was as though ProtagonistA had been born in a small town , and as though ProtagonistA had been born in a small , crowded town , and it had been only twelve here , and there was a full moon , and it had been fenced off and a total of sixty - four people , and no one knew , and nobody was quite sure what the password was , and it did not make any difference , because nobody had ever had the misfortune of knowing what the password was , and nobody had ever going to be a million times as smart as ProtagonistA was , and nobody was n't quite sure how they got into the place , and nobody was quite sure how they started , and nobody had ever known , and nobody had ever really known , and theory was as cold as theory , and theory was what had , as far as anybody was concerned , taken the place of practice ; and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and 
ProtagonistA was sitting at the table , listening to the conversation around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was enjoying the company of ProtagonistA's friends and family 
 ProtagonistA perked up , interested in hearing more about this place 
When ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's seventies , ProtagonistA was walking ProtagonistB 
 One day , while they were out walking , ProtagonistA slipped and fell 
 ProtagonistA was grateful to have ProtagonistB by ProtagonistA's side 
 When they tried to talk to ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA did n't respond , and it was clear that ProtagonistA was in a deep trance 
The night before ProtagonistA drowned , ProtagonistA had a dream , as it were 
 ProtagonistA dreamed that ProtagonistA was walking along a path by a river 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB playing near the water 's edge and ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB , warning ProtagonistB to be careful 
 ProtagonistA ran to the edge of the river , but ProtagonistA could n't reach ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA watched helplessly as ProtagonistB was swept away by the current 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was crying 
ProtagonistA , had not changed one bit since the day ProtagonistA had to flee ProtagonistA's homeland 
 ProtagonistA had been living in a refugee camp for the past year , and ProtagonistA was starting to lose hope 
 ProtagonistA was tired , and hungry , and cold 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's home , and ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's family 
 But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 One day , ProtagonistA heard a rumor that there was a way to escape the camp 
 ProtagonistA did n't know if it was true , but ProtagonistA was willing to try anything 
 That night , ProtagonistA snuck out of the camp , and started walking 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving 
 ProtagonistA walked for days , until ProtagonistA came to a city 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was safe 
 ProtagonistA found a job , and a place to live , and ProtagonistA started to build a new life 
 ProtagonistA is finally starting to feel like ProtagonistA again 
 ProtagonistA 's made new friends , and ProtagonistA 's started to feel like ProtagonistA belongs 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA 's lucky to be alive , and ProtagonistA 's determined to make the most of it 
ProtagonistA called ProtagonistB by ProtagonistA's surname , and we have been called by it ever since 
 ProtagonistA was looking forward to relaxing in ProtagonistA's warm apartment , but first ProtagonistA had to make a phone call 
 ProtagonistA dialed the number and waited for someone to answer 
ProtagonistA was a woman who loved to move 
 ProtagonistA was always relocating from one place to another , and ProtagonistA loved the long , slow process of packing up ProtagonistA's things and starting anew 
 Finally , after years of trying , ProtagonistA found a place that the Living could n't find 
 ProtagonistA was able to move there and start ProtagonistA's new life 
ProtagonistA , descended the aisle of the château of the Riveuilles ; an imposing house of splendour and distinction , from which ProtagonistA received the name of Richelieu , or Richelodio , or , perhaps , of Lord Bertram 
 ProtagonistA had always been a dutiful daughter , but now ProtagonistA was being called upon to be so much more 
 It was a daunting task , but ProtagonistA was up to the challenge 
 ProtagonistA had always been a natural leader and ProtagonistA was confident in ProtagonistA's abilities 
 ProtagonistA would make ProtagonistA's ancestors proud 
 ProtagonistA would make the Riveuilles name mean something again 
 ProtagonistA walked down the aisle with ProtagonistA's head held high 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had the support of ProtagonistA's family and ProtagonistA would not let them down 
 ProtagonistA would make them proud 
ProtagonistA was unaccustomed to the sight of ProtagonistA's brother 's statue with ProtagonistA's father on the Westminster tower 
 ProtagonistA felt dismayed and intellectually disgraced at what ProtagonistA saw 
ProtagonistA woke early , and ProtagonistA woke often , as if ProtagonistA had been awake forever , until it was too late 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should have been asleep hours ago , but ProtagonistA could n't help it 
 ProtagonistA was restless and wide awake 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and paced around ProtagonistA's room , trying to tire ProtagonistA out , but it was no use 
 ProtagonistA eventually gave up and laid down , but ProtagonistA still could n't fall asleep 
 ProtagonistA stared at the ceiling , ProtagonistA's mind racing , until ProtagonistA finally dozed off 
ProtagonistA has finished ProtagonistA's work and is ready to go now 
 ProtagonistA hears the voice even now , telling ProtagonistA to hurry up and get going 
 ProtagonistA knows that if ProtagonistA does n't hurry , the voice will get angry and start yelling at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA does n't want to anger the voice , so ProtagonistA hurries to get going 
ProtagonistA had chosen the kingdom of Heaven out of all creation ; and the power of the Holy One of Israel had shone forth in every way , to please ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who loved to swim 
 One day , ProtagonistA went swimming with ProtagonistA's friends and they dared ProtagonistA to swim out to the deep end 
 ProtagonistA hesitated at first , but then ProtagonistA took the challenge 
 ProtagonistA swam out to the deep end and then ProtagonistA started to sink 
 ProtagonistA struggled to swim back to the surface , but ProtagonistA could n't make it 
 The night before ProtagonistA drowned , ProtagonistA had a dream 
 In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA was swimming in the pool and ProtagonistA started to sink 
 ProtagonistA struggled to swim back to the surface , but ProtagonistA could n't make it 
 ProtagonistA woke up in a cold sweat , but ProtagonistA dismissed the dream as just a nightmare 
 Little did ProtagonistA know that it was a warning of what was to come 
ProtagonistA walked the streets of Croydon , and felt as if ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's heart in ProtagonistA's hands 
 ProtagonistA had never felt this way before , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do with the overwhelming feeling 
 ProtagonistA wanted to cry , to scream , to let it all out 
 But ProtagonistA did n't 
ProtagonistA , with ProtagonistB , at ProtagonistA's side , rode out into the great wide plain of Phlegethon , where ProtagonistA found the rest of ProtagonistA's family in the company of Mrs
 ProtagonistA lay still , unconscious 
ProtagonistA stood on the horizon of the world , a proud and proud man , but one who knew ProtagonistA had nothing to fear but might actually have some advantage over a very large and very dangerous enemy 
 ProtagonistA was ready to take on anything that came ProtagonistA's way 
 Whatever the case may have been , ProtagonistA was a fearsome sight 
 And ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA stammered ,  ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB in a dark alley 
 ProtagonistA ran away and hid in a nearby store 
 ProtagonistA called the police and they came and arrested ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a woman who enjoyed the art of murdering 
 ProtagonistA was also a man who enjoyed the art of murdering 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to kill ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA lured ProtagonistB into a dark alley and stabbed ProtagonistB to death 
 As ProtagonistA walked away , ProtagonistA felt a sense of satisfaction 
 ProtagonistA had finally gotten ProtagonistA's revenge 
 Fearing for ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA hastily packed a few belongings and set out for the palace 
 ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA had been afraid for ProtagonistA's life 
 One day , ProtagonistA came to me with a proposal 
 ProtagonistA had been thinking about it for a while , ProtagonistA said , and ProtagonistA thought it was time 
 ProtagonistA wanted to move to the country 
 I was hesitant at first , but I knew that ProtagonistA was not happy in the city 
 ProtagonistA was happier than I had ever seen ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA loved the peace and quiet of the country , and I loved being able to see ProtagonistA happy 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's chair on the left , reading a letter ; but the letter was full of facts that were interesting to ProtagonistA , such as , ProtagonistA's uncle was a man of coarse manners , and , in consequence of the poverty of his household , very few persons in its neighbourhood were wealthy , and in whom ProtagonistA had any feeling of sympathy 
 ProtagonistA had just finished the letter , when ProtagonistA was interrupted by a knock at the door 
ProtagonistA sat in the sun and ProtagonistA's mind busy 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about all the things ProtagonistA had to do that day 
 ProtagonistA had to go to the grocery store , pick up ProtagonistA's dry cleaning , and meet ProtagonistA's friend for lunch 
 ProtagonistA was also thinking about ProtagonistA's upcoming vacation 
 ProtagonistA was going to visit ProtagonistA's family in Florida and ProtagonistA was really looking forward to it 
 ProtagonistA was with ProtagonistB at the time and they were both drunk 
ProtagonistA was the most famous and adored character in the world 
 ProtagonistA was just a normal girl , living a normal life 
 But one day , ProtagonistA was the victim of a brutal attack 
One day ProtagonistA came to Washington , and , being highly desirous of seeing the grounds of the new Capitol , refused to leave until ProtagonistA had seen them into which the hall had been enlarged for the new institution ; and if ProtagonistA had been right , ProtagonistA should be justified in saying that ProtagonistA had never seen anything so amiss 
 ProtagonistA was a large , well - dressed woman , with a pleasant face and a kind voice 
 ProtagonistA was sitting behind a desk , and ProtagonistA motioned for the men to sit down 
 ProtagonistA asked them how they were , and they all said that they were fine 
 ProtagonistA asked them if they had any news , and they all said that they did not 
 Finally , ProtagonistA asked them why they had come to see ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA leaned back in ProtagonistA's chair and listened as ProtagonistB explained the situation 
 ProtagonistA thought for a moment , and then ProtagonistA agreed to help them 
 ProtagonistA told them that ProtagonistA would give them each a loan of £ 400 
 I'm a good Christian woman ,  ProtagonistA said 
  And ProtagonistA believe that it is ProtagonistA's duty to help those in need 
 ProtagonistA sat back in ProtagonistA's chair and smiled 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have been able to help the men , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had made the right decision 
ProtagonistA stopped dead in ProtagonistA's tracks , and then ProtagonistA tried to find the source of the sound 
 ProtagonistA looked around frantically , but it just was n't there 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA heard it again 
 ProtagonistA followed the sound until ProtagonistA came to a small door 
 ProtagonistA opened it and found a staircase leading down 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA heard the sound again 
 ProtagonistA started to descend the stairs , but ProtagonistA stopped when ProtagonistA heard a voice 
  ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to help 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and opened the door 
ProtagonistA was walking after dark when ProtagonistA heard a noise behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB following ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA started to run , but ProtagonistB ran after ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA screamed for help , but no one came 
 ProtagonistA fought back , but ProtagonistB was too strong 
 ProtagonistA lay there , bleeding and in pain , until ProtagonistA died 
ProtagonistA managed to keep ProtagonistA's head and face up , to enjoy the moment 
 ProtagonistA was standing on the top of the Empire State Building , and the view was incredible 
 But in that moment , ProtagonistA felt alive and happy and free 
ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way to the grocery store when ProtagonistA saw a group of men sitting around on the side of the road 
 ProtagonistA wondered if they had any leisure time to think about what they would do with their lives 
 ProtagonistA also wondered if they had any other options besides sitting on the side of the road 
 ProtagonistA decided to ask them 
 ProtagonistA had never considered that they might not have any other options 
 ProtagonistA thanked them for their time and went on ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA was more grateful than ever for ProtagonistA's own life and the opportunities ProtagonistA had been given 
 ProtagonistA vowed to help others who might not be as fortunate as ProtagonistA was 
ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer 
 ProtagonistA would often stay up late into the night , dreaming about what ProtagonistA's life could be 
 One night , ProtagonistA had the great dream 
 And yet , ProtagonistA could not help but be drawn to it 
 And so , ProtagonistA drank to the full 
ProtagonistA was out for a walk on the frozen lake when ProtagonistA heard a crack 
 ProtagonistA could feel the cold water numbing ProtagonistA's body and the ice pulling at ProtagonistA's hair 
 ProtagonistA struggled to free ProtagonistA , but it was no use 
 ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistA losing consciousness 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a door that ProtagonistA had never seen before 
 ProtagonistA could n't resist trying to open it , but it was locked 
 ProtagonistA shook the handles , but the door would n't budge 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a voice on the other side of the door 
 ProtagonistA must n't go in 
 ProtagonistA wanted to know what was inside the forest and ProtagonistA was going to find out 
 ProtagonistA started to look for a key to the door , but ProtagonistA could n't find one anywhere 
 Then ProtagonistA had an idea 
 ProtagonistA took out ProtagonistA's pocket knife and started to pick the lock 
 ProtagonistA walked into the forest and ProtagonistA was never seen again 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who had a fear of abandonment 
 ProtagonistA was always afraid that someone would leave ProtagonistA , or that ProtagonistA would be alone 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's family and friends , but ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was the odd one out 
 When ProtagonistA was a little old man , ProtagonistA saw everything in the world and ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistA would never be able to find love 
 ProtagonistA was wrong 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had always been interested in the world beyond ProtagonistA's small town , and now ProtagonistA had the chance to explore it 
 ProtagonistA was going to be a part of a group of students who were going to travel to different countries to learn about their cultures 
 ProtagonistA could n't wait to see the world and learn about all the different people in it 
ProtagonistA had always loved the stone house in ProtagonistE's garden 
 ProtagonistA would pretend ProtagonistA was a princess living in a castle , and the stone house was ProtagonistA's fortress 
 As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to wonder about the history of the house 
 Who had built it ? Why was it built on the foundation of an old house?One day , as ProtagonistA stood in the garden , tracing the outlines of the structure ProtagonistA had built there , the man who would become known as the Great Scribe of the Old Testament , or , as some people called ProtagonistB , the Habite Cretan , or simply the Lost Scribe , began to write 
 And ProtagonistA would always remember ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had been shopping online for ProtagonistA's groceries for weeks , and ProtagonistA always used Walmart 
 ProtagonistA was happy with the prices and the selection , and ProtagonistA never had any problems 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistA had a tussle with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so angry that ProtagonistA decided to never shop at Walmart again 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who had been living in a city of indeterminate size and location for the last three thousand years 
 ProtagonistA was one of the few people who had been able to find a way to put an end to the anarchy 
 ProtagonistA did this by taking refuge in the city 
 As we got older , ProtagonistA began to struggle with ProtagonistA's mental health 
 ProtagonistA would have episodes where ProtagonistA would become paranoid and believe that people were out to get ProtagonistA 
 Thankfully , ProtagonistA is now doing much better and ProtagonistA is on the road to recovery 
 Our relationship is still strained , but I am grateful that ProtagonistA is still here with me 
ProtagonistA rose early that morning , lifting ProtagonistA's ten - pound hammer from the table before she and pounding the ground 
 ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's house for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to see some progress 
 ProtagonistA was determined to finish it by ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was not going to let anything stop ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA worked , ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's life and how much it had changed in the past year 
 ProtagonistA used to be a happy , carefree person , but now ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was constantly fighting just to keep ProtagonistA's head above water 
 ProtagonistA worked all morning , and by the time lunchtime rolled around , ProtagonistA was ready to take a break 
 ProtagonistA was just about to sit down when ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance 
 ProtagonistA followed the sound until ProtagonistA came to a clearing 
 There , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB sitting on the ground , crying ProtagonistB's eyes out 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistA could n't just leave ProtagonistB there 
 ProtagonistA sat down next to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say , but ProtagonistA hugged ProtagonistB tightly 
 ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistB that everything was going to be alright , even though ProtagonistA did n't know if that was true 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's own life and how ProtagonistA was also going through a tough time 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA helped ProtagonistB to ProtagonistB's feet and walked ProtagonistB's home 
 ProtagonistA made sure to get ProtagonistB's address so ProtagonistA could keep in touch 
 ProtagonistA went home feeling exhausted , but also grateful 
 ProtagonistA was determined to help them however ProtagonistA could 
ProtagonistA was happy when I first met ProtagonistA 
 The first thing I ever thought of ProtagonistA was that ProtagonistA was a holy man , and a good man 
 ProtagonistA always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face , and ProtagonistA was always willing to help others 
 ProtagonistA was a true example of what a good person should be 
ProtagonistA was once a highly respected merchant 
 ProtagonistA was always willing to help others and to share ProtagonistA's knowledge 
ProtagonistA was the god of the seas , and ProtagonistB had a hard time determining ProtagonistB's true identity 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA was approached by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA tried to explain to ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA did n't have that much money on ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB did n't believe ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB threatened to call the police if ProtagonistA did n't give ProtagonistB the money , so ProtagonistA reluctantly gave ProtagonistB the money 
ProtagonistA was finding it difficult to focus on ProtagonistA's reading 
 It was an afternoon of some utility ; it was the middle of January , 1863 , and ProtagonistA was working ProtagonistA's way through an appendix to the first edition of The Origin of Species , which ProtagonistA was carrying with ProtagonistA on ProtagonistA's arm at all times , though ProtagonistA was at times so much employed as to be at rest 
 ProtagonistA kept getting distracted by ProtagonistA's thoughts , which kept wandering to the current state of affairs 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but worry about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB terribly and wondered if ProtagonistA would ever see ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistA forced ProtagonistA to focus on ProtagonistA's reading again 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA needed to keep ProtagonistA's mind occupied or ProtagonistA would go crazy with worry 
 ProtagonistA read on , but ProtagonistA's mind kept wandering 
The first time I saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was dancing through the streets of New York in a red hot mess of a car and a packed black crowd of people , mostly women and children 
 ProtagonistA was laughing and singing and ProtagonistA's hair was flying in the wind 
 ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA was a dull boy , but not to the point of being a loner , except in the locality where ProtagonistA had an uncle , an aunt , and a cousin ; and as ProtagonistA was such a person , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA quite agreeable to everybody , even to the great majority of ProtagonistA's elders 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was out walking , ProtagonistA met a stranger who asked ProtagonistA for directions 
 ProtagonistA was happy to help , and the two ended up chatting for a while 
 When the stranger asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA wanted to come back to their house for some tea , ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then decided to go 
 It was only when ProtagonistA was inside the stranger 's house that ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had been tricked 
 The stranger had kidnapped ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistA was terrified , and tried to escape , but it was no use 
 ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA would die there , all alone 
 ProtagonistA was glad to be safe , but the experience had left ProtagonistA shaken , and ProtagonistA vowed never to talk to strangers again 
 ProtagonistA was so delighted that ProtagonistA could hardly contain ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA went at once to tell ProtagonistA's father and mother of the good news 
 ProtagonistA noticed , however , that the Queen looked very stern and angry , and ProtagonistA wondered what was the matter 
 After a time ProtagonistA was sorry ProtagonistA had come , for the Queen kept scowling at ProtagonistA so fiercely that it quite frightened ProtagonistA ; and then , when ProtagonistA was tired of dancing , ProtagonistA wanted to go home , but ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA must stay till midnight 
 As ProtagonistA was leaving the hall the Queen said to ProtagonistA in a loud voice ,  ProtagonistA are nothing but a common little girl , and I 'll have ProtagonistA sent to prison for coming here without an ProtagonistA was so astonished at this that ProtagonistA could not speak ; but ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA outside the palace doors in a moment , and running down the steps as fast as ProtagonistA could 
ProtagonistA did not know whether ProtagonistA should rejoice or cry 
 As ProtagonistA sat at ProtagonistA's desk , ProtagonistA vacillated between feelings of happiness and sadness 
  Yes , ProtagonistA 'm fine ,  ProtagonistA replied , forced a smile 
ProtagonistA was just a boy when ProtagonistA had a dream 
 In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA was a beautiful princess who lived in a castle 
 ProtagonistA had long , flowing hair and a beautiful dress 
 One day , ProtagonistA met a handsome prince , and they fell in love 
ProtagonistA put ProtagonistA's hand on the glass , and slowly , with a gentle pressure , leaned it to the side 
 ProtagonistA felt the coolness of the glass against ProtagonistA's skin and the smoothness of the surface 
 The glass was heavy , but ProtagonistA was able to move it with ProtagonistA's hand 
 ProtagonistA slowly leaned the glass until it was at a 45-degree angle 
 Then ProtagonistA stopped and looked at the glass 
 ProtagonistA could see the reflection of ProtagonistA's hand in the glass 
 ProtagonistA felt the weight of the glass against her hand and the pressure of the glass against ProtagonistA's skin 
 ProtagonistA slowly lowered the glass back to the table 
ProtagonistA was waiting for ProtagonistB , just as ProtagonistA usually was 
 ProtagonistA checked ProtagonistA's watch and tapping ProtagonistA's foot impatiently 
 ProtagonistA was just about to give up and go home when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB running towards ProtagonistA , out of breath 
   It 's fine ,  ProtagonistA replied , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little disappointed 
 ProtagonistA had been looking forward to spending time with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had only been living in the small town for a few months , but it seemed like everyone knew who ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA was the only foreigner in town , and ProtagonistA stood out like a sore thumb 
 ProtagonistA tried to keep to ProtagonistA , but it was hard when everyone was always staring at ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA went into the local grocery store and the cashier started whispering to the person next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistA's face getting red , and ProtagonistA quickly paid for ProtagonistA's things and left 
 ProtagonistA was sure that they were talking about ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA did n't want to give them the satisfaction of knowing that they had gotten to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA started to feel like a prisoner in ProtagonistA's own home , and ProtagonistA longed to go back to ProtagonistA's home country 
 ProtagonistA missed the bustling city and the anonymity that came with it 
 Here , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was always under a microscope 
 One day , ProtagonistA could n't take it anymore and ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and left 
 ProtagonistA did n't look back , and ProtagonistA did n't say goodbye to anyone 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA knew the way to heaven but in fact ProtagonistA knew nothing at all 
 ProtagonistA had always been a good person , ProtagonistA had never lied or cheated or stolen 
 ProtagonistA had always helped others and ProtagonistA had always been kind 
 But as ProtagonistA stood at the gates of heaven , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been wrong 
 ProtagonistA was about to turn away and give up when ProtagonistA heard a voice 
  ProtagonistA have always been a good person 
 ProtagonistA have helped others and ProtagonistA have been kind 
 What is it ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA was surprised 
 ProtagonistA had never thought that ProtagonistA needed to forgive ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA had made mistakes in ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA had hurt people , even if ProtagonistA had n't meant to 
 Forgiving ProtagonistA was the hardest thing ProtagonistA had ever done , but ProtagonistA knew it was the right thing to do 
 And once ProtagonistA had forgiven ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA found that the gates of heaven were open to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was walking through the park when ProtagonistA overheard two women whispering 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but overhear them mention ProtagonistA's name and nationality 
 ProtagonistA felt a pang of sadness that ProtagonistA was the topic of their conversation 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could just disappear and be invisible 
ProtagonistA was very old 
 ProtagonistA had lived a long and happy life , but now ProtagonistA was ready to move on 
 ProtagonistA had seen all ProtagonistA's friends and family pass away , and ProtagonistA was ready to join them 
 ProtagonistA looked back on ProtagonistA's life with happiness and gratitude , and then ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and passed away 
ProtagonistA was taking a walk one day when ProtagonistA suddenly realized that ProtagonistA had been born 
 ProtagonistA was amazed at how much ProtagonistA had changed since then 
 ProtagonistA had grown taller , ProtagonistA's hair was different , and ProtagonistA was wearing different clothes 
 ProtagonistA wondered how ProtagonistA's life would have been different if ProtagonistA had never been born 
ProtagonistA comes at night , the terror of ProtagonistA's lips , limber and voice , stronger than the deathbringer that lay before ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's teeth are black from blood 
 ProtagonistA had killed before , but never like this 
 ProtagonistA was a predator , and ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's prey 
 ProtagonistA could see the fear in ProtagonistB's eyes , and ProtagonistA reveled in it 
 ProtagonistA was going to enjoy this 
 ProtagonistA leaned in close , ProtagonistA lips inches from ProtagonistB's neck , and ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistB's pulse racing 
 ProtagonistA could smell the fear on ProtagonistB , and it was intoxicating 
 ProtagonistA smiled , and then ProtagonistA struck 
The first time I met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was lying on a hospital table in the middle of London 
 ProtagonistA was so still and pale that I thought ProtagonistA was dead 
ProtagonistA was a historian who loved nothing more than spending ProtagonistA's days reading old books in ProtagonistA's study in the Court of the Tuileries 
 ProtagonistA was particularly interested in books about the French Revolution , and ProtagonistA had just found an old and heavy book about the subject which ProtagonistA was eagerly reading 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's chest and ProtagonistA collapsed to the floor 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was dying , and ProtagonistA had just enough time to think about ProtagonistA's life and all that ProtagonistA had accomplished before ProtagonistA passed away 
ProtagonistA , kept up for the last two years of the reign of Suddistharma , a fine , fine trade and business , in which the prosperity of the kingdom depended greatly , from a view of employment to the general good , and from a view of revenue to the interest of a great many millions of pounds , which ProtagonistA called a royal prerogative , and which ProtagonistA possessed by extraction , or some other means which I may not venture to mention here , although , in truth , it was of considerable consequence to ProtagonistA's current business 
ProtagonistA stood up from the log ProtagonistA 'd been sitting on and peered out from the dark cover of ProtagonistA's tea cup 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should n't have come out here by ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA had been so curious about the strange noise ProtagonistA 'd heard 
 Now ProtagonistA was regretting ProtagonistA's decision 
 ProtagonistA started to back away from the edge of the woods , when ProtagonistA heard the noise again 
 ProtagonistA froze in fear , not knowing what to do 
 ProtagonistA was so scared ProtagonistA screamed and ran the other way 
 ProtagonistA did n't stop until ProtagonistA was safely back at ProtagonistA's house 
 ProtagonistA vowed never to go into the woods by ProtagonistA again 
ProtagonistA had just become a full - grown man , and ProtagonistB was already paying ProtagonistA's attention 
 ProtagonistA had never heard of ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistA did n't want to show ProtagonistA's ignorance 
 ProtagonistA smiled back at ProtagonistB and said ,  Of course ProtagonistA have 
 Really ?  ProtagonistA said , genuinely interested 
  ProtagonistA 'd love to read it when it 's finished 
ProtagonistA lived a long and difficult life 
 For the first four hundred years , ProtagonistA never trusted anyone except during the most extreme times of ProtagonistA's suffering 
 ProtagonistA continued to fight and survive , even when it seemed like there was no hope left 
 In the end , ProtagonistA prevailed and lived to tell the tale 
 ProtagonistA was always so excited to see new places and meet new people 
 ProtagonistA loved the history and the culture 
 ProtagonistA was always so amazed by the architecture and the art 
 ProtagonistA would spend hours walking around the city , taking in all the sights 
 ProtagonistA was always so happy when ProtagonistA was there 
ProtagonistA had been dreaming of snow since ProtagonistA had been a boy 
 ProtagonistA loved the way it looked , the way it smelled , and the way it felt 
 ProtagonistA would spend hours outside in the snow , making snowmen and snow angels 
 When ProtagonistA was older , ProtagonistA even learned how to ski and snowboard 
 ProtagonistA loved everything about winter 
 ProtagonistA started having nightmares about the snow 
 ProtagonistA would wake up in a cold sweat , heart racing , and ProtagonistA would never want to go outside again 
 ProtagonistA stopped skiing and snowboarding , and ProtagonistA stopped going outside altogether when the snow started falling 
 ProtagonistA became a hermit , living in ProtagonistA's house and only going out when ProtagonistA absolutely had to 
 But one day , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was letting ProtagonistA's fear control ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was missing out on all the things ProtagonistA loved because ProtagonistA was too afraid to face ProtagonistA's fears 
 So , ProtagonistA took a deep breath and walked outside into the snow 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA's nightmares were just that - nightmares 
 ProtagonistA started going outside again , and ProtagonistA even went skiing and snowboarding 
 ProtagonistA was living ProtagonistA's life again , and ProtagonistA was happy 
ProtagonistA must have gone insane , for ProtagonistA could n't keep ProtagonistA's hands to the wheel 
 ProtagonistA was driving down the highway , and the car was swerving all over the place 
 ProtagonistA was laughing and singing at the top of ProtagonistA's lungs , and ProtagonistA did n't seem to care that ProtagonistA was in danger 
 Finally , ProtagonistA lost control of the car and it careened off the road 
ProtagonistA had always been a special girl 
 When ProtagonistA was just eleven years old , ProtagonistA had a vision of a great disaster that was going to happen in ProtagonistA's hometown 
 ProtagonistA tried to warn ProtagonistA's family and friends , but they just laughed at ProtagonistA and called ProtagonistA a crazy girl 
 But ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA saw was real 
 ProtagonistA was the only one who had known about the disaster beforehand 
 ProtagonistA was able to warn ProtagonistA's loved ones and help them to safety 
 Ever since then , ProtagonistA has used ProtagonistA's gift to help others 
 ProtagonistA has helped to solve crimes , find missing people , and even save lives 
 ProtagonistA is truly a remarkable young woman 
There was once a boy who was known to everyone but ProtagonistA by ProtagonistA's given name – a boy called Noah , who was supposed to have been born in the year 1224 , on the very day that ProtagonistA was , according to some versions , murdered by a demon 
 ProtagonistA was the only person who knew ProtagonistB's true identity – and ProtagonistA was the only one who knew that ProtagonistB was n't really a boy at all , but a creature from another world who had come to Earth in order to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB became friends , and together they were able to defeat the demon 
 ProtagonistA was sad to see ProtagonistB go , but ProtagonistA was also happy that ProtagonistB had been able to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that they would always be friends , no matter what 
 ProtagonistA felt right at home with ProtagonistA's new family and knew that ProtagonistA would always be loved and accepted by them 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who lived in a small town 
 ProtagonistA was always curious about the world and loved to explore 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole that led ProtagonistA into a strange and wonderful place 
 ProtagonistA met many interesting characters along the way and had many adventures 
 In the end , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's way back home and was able to share ProtagonistA's stories with everyone 
 ProtagonistA was always a special girl , even from a young age 
 ProtagonistA always seemed to have a greater purpose 
 As ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA realised that what ProtagonistB had said was true 
 And ProtagonistA was going to make the best of it 
 ProtagonistA was going to make it a better place for everyone 
 And ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB for it 
The first time I met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was in the kitchen of ProtagonistA's Nantucket house , stirring a pot of oysters and staring in the mirror 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a red dress and ProtagonistA's hair was up in a messy bun 
 ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA was a million miles away 
  Oh , ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA did n't see you there 
  It 's nice to meet you ,  ProtagonistA finally said 
ProtagonistA was dead , and ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was terrified of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did n't want to disobey ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA did n't marry ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB would kill ProtagonistA 
 So , ProtagonistA agreed to marry ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was miserable , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to pretend to be happy 
 ProtagonistA cried and begged ProtagonistB to stop , but ProtagonistB did n't listen 
ProtagonistA was a man , or at least ProtagonistA looked like one , of unquestionable fortune 
 ProtagonistA was the kind of person that made others uncomfortable without knowing why 
 ProtagonistA always had a feeling that ProtagonistA was different from everyone else , but ProtagonistA could n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on why 
 ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was playing a role in some grand performance , but ProtagonistA did n't know what the end goal was 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to find out more about ProtagonistA's past 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's parents ' house and rummaged through their things , looking for anything that could give ProtagonistA a clue 
 ProtagonistA found a box hidden away in a cupboard that contained old letters and photos 
 As ProtagonistA looked through the contents of the box , ProtagonistA finally began to piece together the truth 
 ProtagonistA felt like everything suddenly made sense 
 ProtagonistA was a man , or at least ProtagonistA looked like one , because that 's what ProtagonistA's parents had raised ProtagonistA to be 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA owed it to ProtagonistA's parents to make something of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was going to make them proud , even if they were no longer alive to see it 
ProtagonistA was in a dream in which ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was very interested in everything ProtagonistB had to say 
 When ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA was surprised to find that ProtagonistA was actually in ProtagonistB's arms 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how it was possible , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 All ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistA was happy to be there 
There was ProtagonistA in a village where ProtagonistA had no name , and from whence ProtagonistA looked no more than a village - name ; and ProtagonistA was well known to everybody , and was a good , honest boy in everything 
 And ProtagonistB said to ProtagonistA ,  What is ProtagonistA's name ?  And ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA have no name 
 ProtagonistA had always enjoyed ProtagonistB's novels , but never dreamed that ProtagonistA would one day have the opportunity to meet ProtagonistB in person 
ProtagonistA is sixteen , and ProtagonistA really is a genius , or at least a great talent 
 ProtagonistA is a math prodigy 
 ProtagonistA can do complex calculations in ProtagonistA's head faster than most people can with a calculator 
 ProtagonistA 's also a great artist 
 ProtagonistA can draw incredibly realistic portraits of people and animals 
 And ProtagonistA believes them 
 ProtagonistA is always looking for ways to use ProtagonistA's talents to make a difference 
 ProtagonistA 's always looking for new challenges to push ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA has the potential to do great things 
ProtagonistA always loved the sea 
 As a little girl , ProtagonistA would tell ProtagonistA's parents that ProtagonistA would one day hunt the sea for fish 
 ProtagonistA would go to the sea and look for fish 
 And one day , ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA found a school of fish and managed to catch a few 
ProtagonistA came to the yacht concert with ProtagonistA's crew 
 ProtagonistA was excited to see the show and meet the other concertgoers 
 Unfortunately , ProtagonistA's crew was not as excited as ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA tried to enjoy the concert , but it was difficult with ProtagonistA's crew 's negative attitude 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA gave up and left the concert early 
ProtagonistA had always loved coming to ProtagonistA's cabin on the edge of Lake Superior 
 On this particular day , ProtagonistA was feeling particularly introspective 
 ProtagonistA walked down to the lake and sat on the bank , letting the clear water soothe ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA thought back over ProtagonistA's life and all the choices ProtagonistA had made 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life and grateful for all ProtagonistA's blessings 
 As ProtagonistA sat there , ProtagonistA saw a fish jump out of the water and then dive back in 
 It was a sign , ProtagonistA thought 
In the year of our Lord 1849 , in the month of May , ProtagonistA , came to the door of the house at 14 James Street , and said ProtagonistA was going to Washington to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was their only child 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful young woman , with blonde hair and blue eyes 
 ProtagonistA was very intelligent and well - educated 
 ProtagonistA had been to Europe and had seen many famous people 
 But ProtagonistA had never been to Washington to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA had heard that ProtagonistB was a very important man , and ProtagonistA wanted to meet ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA was very determined to go 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA would be very careful and would take a chaperone with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was very excited about ProtagonistA's trip 
 ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and left for Washington the next day 
 ProtagonistA had a wonderful time in Washington 
 ProtagonistA met many famous people , including ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA saw many interesting sights 
 ProtagonistA even got to go to the White House and meet ProtagonistB's wife 
 When ProtagonistA returned home , ProtagonistA was very excited to tell ProtagonistA's parents about ProtagonistA's trip 
 ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had gone to Washington 
 It was a trip ProtagonistA would never forget 
ProtagonistA was an orphan who lived in a very poor village 
 ProtagonistA often helped the other villagers with their chores , and they would often give ProtagonistA food or clothes in return 
 ProtagonistA agreed , and ProtagonistA eventually found the dog 
 With this gold , ProtagonistA was able to buy a new house and clothes for ProtagonistA and the other villagers 
 ProtagonistA also helped the village by paying for the repairs of the village well 
ProtagonistA had been on ProtagonistA's usual wife - beating sprawl for hours , after how deeply ProtagonistA had been in debt and wasted luxury 
 ProtagonistA had been on the streets since ProtagonistA was a child , and ProtagonistA knew how to take care of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been planning to leave ProtagonistA's abusive husband for years , but ProtagonistA never had the courage to do it 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being beaten and abused , and ProtagonistA was tired of living in poverty 
 ProtagonistA had finally had enough , and ProtagonistA was going to take ProtagonistA's life back 
 ProtagonistA was going to find a way to get out of this mess , and ProtagonistA was going to start over 
In the year 1882 , ProtagonistA married Catherine Pilley , a girl fifteen years younger than ProtagonistA , who had only recently been admitted to college -- at Ull - west in the province of Wales 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who lived in a small village 
 One day , ProtagonistA went into the forest to gather some wood for ProtagonistA's fire 
 While ProtagonistA was there , ProtagonistA came across a cauldron 
 ProtagonistA decided to take it home with ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA placed the cauldron over ProtagonistA's fire and began to cook 
 ProtagonistA put in some water and some vegetables , and then ProtagonistA added some of the feathers from the birds ProtagonistA had seen in the forest 
 ProtagonistA was startled , but ProtagonistA quickly realized that the feathers were being used to make a soup 
 The soup was delicious , and ProtagonistA was able to feed ProtagonistA's entire family with it 
 ProtagonistA was never one for making friends , and ProtagonistA always preferred to be alone 
 Even as a child , ProtagonistA would always find a way to be alone , and ProtagonistA never really understood why 
 It was n't that ProtagonistA did n't want to be around people , ProtagonistA just never felt the need for companionship 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's own company , and ProtagonistA never felt the need for anyone else 
 As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA became even more of a loner 
 ProtagonistA would go days without speaking to anyone , and ProtagonistA was perfectly happy with that 
 ProtagonistA never felt the need for human interaction , and ProtagonistA was perfectly content with ProtagonistA's own thoughts 
 ProtagonistA was happy with who ProtagonistA was , and ProtagonistA never felt the need to change 
 ProtagonistA had always seen love stories , and ProtagonistA had always wanted to experience it for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA wanted to find someone who loved ProtagonistA for who ProtagonistA was , and ProtagonistA wanted to be loved unconditionally 
 However , ProtagonistA knew that was never going to happen 
 ProtagonistA was a loner , and ProtagonistA knew that no one would ever love ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was the first of ProtagonistA's kind , a creature of the air , with wings that caught the sunlight and turned it into rainbows 
 ProtagonistA flew from place to place , bringing joy and laughter wherever ProtagonistA went 
 ProtagonistA brought happiness to the grieving and comfort to the sorrowful 
 ProtagonistA was a ray of hope in dark times 
 One day , ProtagonistA bid farewell to ProtagonistA's friends and flew away , never to be seen again 
 But the memory of ProtagonistA and the happiness ProtagonistA brought lives on in the hearts of all who knew ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who loved to explore 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB in the forest 
 ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB for hours , until ProtagonistA came to a large door 
 Once ProtagonistA was through the door , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a very different place 
 ProtagonistA was so fascinated by this new place that ProtagonistA forgot all about ProtagonistB 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to leave 
 But ProtagonistA did n't listen 
 ProtagonistA was having too much fun 
 ProtagonistA loved to daydream and make up stories in ProtagonistA's head 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking in the forest when ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and found ProtagonistA in a strange place 
 ProtagonistA began to explore and found a table with a big cake on it 
 The cake said  EAT ME  so ProtagonistA took a bite 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA began to grow and grow until ProtagonistA was as big as the house 
 ProtagonistA found a little door that ProtagonistA could fit through and squeezed ProtagonistA through it 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden 
 ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life until ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to leave , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to 
 ProtagonistA said goodbye to the garden and followed ProtagonistB home 
 It was hard work , but I was determined to show ProtagonistA that I was just as worthy as ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA started to treat me with the same respect that ProtagonistA treated ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA may have put it best at the end of ProtagonistA's last letter 
  With those words , ProtagonistA sealed the envelope and sent it off to ProtagonistA's best friend 
 But through it all , ProtagonistA 'd remained positive and hopeful 
 Now , with ProtagonistA's treatments finished and ProtagonistA's health on the upswing , ProtagonistA was ready to take on whatever life threw ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA was always helping ProtagonistA's parents with their work , and ProtagonistA was always willing to lend a hand to anyone who needed it 
 However , when ProtagonistA was older , ProtagonistA began to realize that there were some things that ProtagonistA could do that ProtagonistA's parents could n't 
 ProtagonistA began to feel like ProtagonistA was different from them and that ProtagonistA had a special gift 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out helping ProtagonistA's parents with their work when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA went over to help ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was able to carry ProtagonistB's groceries for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA could use ProtagonistA's gifts to help others in ways that ProtagonistA's parents could n't 
 ProtagonistA began to feel more confident in ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's abilities 
 ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA was making a difference in the world 
ProtagonistA had always been a special girl 
 ProtagonistA possessed a power that no one else had 
 ProtagonistA had never used ProtagonistA's power for evil 
 ProtagonistA had only ever used it to help others 
 But ProtagonistA knew that there were those who would misuse ProtagonistA's power if they knew about it 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA was skeptical 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to misuse ProtagonistA's power 
 And so , ProtagonistA decided to trust ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had been bedridden for weeks , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's time was running out 
 ProtagonistA was grateful to have ProtagonistA's family by ProtagonistA's side during ProtagonistA's final days 
 On the morning that ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA was peering into the dusty corner of ProtagonistA's room and , spotting a tiny figure looming between a pair of awnings , knew immediately that it was ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and passed away peacefully , knowing that ProtagonistA would be reunited with ProtagonistA's loved ones soon 
ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had been through more than most people could even imagine 
 And yet , ProtagonistA always managed to find a way to keep going 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful sight , with ProtagonistA's long blond hair and blue eyes

ProtagonistA was walking through an open door into a new room when ProtagonistA suddenly remembered that ProtagonistA was supposed to be recording everything for ProtagonistA's friend

 ProtagonistA had been on a boat before , but never as a sailor 
 ProtagonistA had never even been on a boat in the water 
 ProtagonistA had only ever been on a boat in the snow , and that was only because ProtagonistA had to 
 But one day , ProtagonistA decided to become a sailor 
 ProtagonistA went down to the docks and asked to be put on a boat 
 ProtagonistA visited the tundra of Alaska and saw the animals there 
 ProtagonistA even met some of the people who lived on the tundra 
 But eventually , ProtagonistA got homesick and decided to sail back home 
 ProtagonistA thanked the captain of the boat and disembarked 
 ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistA's time as a sailor , and ProtagonistA would always be grateful to the captain for giving ProtagonistA the opportunity to experience it 
ProtagonistA had always wanted to see the great pyramid of Isanaz 
 ProtagonistA had seen pictures of it , but they did n't do it justice 
 Finally , ProtagonistA was standing before it , and ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA stood there for a long time , just admiring it 
 ProtagonistA was so entranced by the pyramid that ProtagonistA did n't even hear someone come up to ProtagonistA until they spoke 
 Yes , it is ,  ProtagonistA said 
 That 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA will never forget the time ProtagonistA spent admiring the great pyramid of Isanaz 
 ProtagonistA was a healthy baby , and ProtagonistA thrived in the care of ProtagonistA's parents 
 ProtagonistA was a happy child , always smiling and laughing 
 ProtagonistA loved to play outside , and ProtagonistA would often run and chase the chickens around the yard

 After the death of his parents , ProtagonistA began to feel as though the whole of humanity had become the same age 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was living in a time that was long past its expiration date 
ProtagonistA was getting old , and ProtagonistA wanted to be the King of the Holy Land instead of the King of the City 
 ProtagonistA was tired of the city life and all the pollution and noise 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be in a place where ProtagonistA could be at peace and where ProtagonistA could worship ProtagonistA's God freely 
 So ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things and moved to the Holy Land 
 ProtagonistA ruled the land with a fair and just hand , and everyone was happy 
 As the years went by , ProtagonistA became more and more loved by ProtagonistA's people 
 ProtagonistA ruled the Holy Land for many years , and it was a peaceful and happy place under ProtagonistA's rule 
 ProtagonistA was a young woman who had been forced to flee ProtagonistA's home in Spain when the Moors invaded 
 ProtagonistA was amazed at the sights and sounds of the city , and ProtagonistB was equally amazed at ProtagonistA's reaction 
 As they made their escape , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA true calling in life 
When ProtagonistA was seven , ProtagonistA learned how to read 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to finally be able to read all by ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA started reading every book ProtagonistA could get ProtagonistA's hands on 
 ProtagonistA loved getting lost in the stories and imagining what it would be like to be the characters in the book 
 ProtagonistA placed ProtagonistA's hand on the counter to steady ProtagonistA , and then ProtagonistA saw the kitchen begin to fill with smoke 
 One day , ProtagonistA found a magic door that led ProtagonistA into a wonderful world full of adventure 
 ProtagonistA met new friends , went on exciting adventures , and had the time of ProtagonistA's life 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA had to say goodbye to ProtagonistA's new friends and return to the real world , but ProtagonistA vowed to never forget ProtagonistA's magical experiences 
ProtagonistA was in a foul mood 
 ProtagonistA had a grin on ProtagonistA's face that let everyone know that they should beware 
 ProtagonistA was ready to give someone a piece of ProtagonistA's mind 
 It did n't matter who it was , ProtagonistA was going to let them have it 
 As ProtagonistA walked down the street , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and said ,  ProtagonistB 're a terrible dog owner 
 ProtagonistA continued to berate ProtagonistB until ProtagonistB was in tears 
 When ProtagonistA was done , ProtagonistA walked away with a satisfied smirk on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA had given someone a piece of ProtagonistA's mind and it felt good 
ProtagonistA was walking home from school when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing in ProtagonistA's path 
 ProtagonistA knew who ProtagonistB was immediately 
  ProtagonistA knew better than to make a deal with ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was curious to hear what ProtagonistB had to say 
 ProtagonistA will be rich , beautiful , and loved by everyone 
  No , thank ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'm not interested 
 ProtagonistA had made ProtagonistA's decision and there was no changing it 
ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life at the feast 
 ProtagonistA was so angry that ProtagonistA threw a plate at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was determined to make ProtagonistB pay for ruining ProtagonistA's feast 
 ProtagonistA had been up there for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had found out that ProtagonistA's parents were getting a divorce 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe that they were actually going to go through with it 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA's life was falling apart 
 ProtagonistA had been up on the roof for so long that ProtagonistA had started to feel dizzy 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA needed to get down , but ProtagonistA did n't want to face the reality of ProtagonistA's life 
 Finally , ProtagonistA made the decision to get down 
 As ProtagonistA stepped down from the roof , ProtagonistA slipped and fell 
 ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistA's head on the ground and was knocked unconscious 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was in the hospital 
 ProtagonistA needed to cherish every moment 
 Now , every time ProtagonistA looks back on that day , ProtagonistA is grateful that ProtagonistA made the decision to get down from the roof 
ProtagonistA was walking to ProtagonistA's office when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB was okay 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart break for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB by the hand and led ProtagonistB into ProtagonistA's office 
 ProtagonistA called the authorities and they took ProtagonistB into their care 
 ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA denied it , of course , but no one believed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a few years younger than ProtagonistB , but the two girls quickly became friends 
 ProtagonistA immediately fell in love with it and begged ProtagonistB to buy it for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to wear ProtagonistA's new dress that ProtagonistA put it on right away 
 However , when ProtagonistA went to show ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA realized that the dress was too big for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did as ProtagonistA was told , and when ProtagonistC , led ProtagonistC's people out of Egypt , ProtagonistA was among them 
 ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistC to the Promised Land , where ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's people live happily to this day 
ProtagonistA had only ten fingers on each hand , but ProtagonistA was a very good pianist 
 ProtagonistA started playing when ProtagonistA was four years old and never stopped 
 Even though ProtagonistA had a disability , ProtagonistA never let it stop ProtagonistA from doing what ProtagonistA loved 
ProtagonistA died on a rainy day in 19 , 18 , so ProtagonistA was about 21 when I was born 
 ProtagonistA was a kind and gentle woman , always quick to help others 
 ProtagonistA loved the rain , and used to say that it was the tears of the angels 
ProtagonistA had always been a headstrong girl , and when ProtagonistA fell in love with ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA's family was less than thrilled 
 In the end , ProtagonistA got ProtagonistA's way and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were married 
The last time I saw ProtagonistA , on the day when ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA had just had a terrible car accident that had left ProtagonistA in a wheelchair , inscrutable and unidentifiable 
ProtagonistA knew it was already too late to save the rest of the world 
 ProtagonistA had seen the signs for years , but ProtagonistA had been in denial 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forgive ProtagonistA for letting it happen 
 Now , as ProtagonistA looked out at the destruction , ProtagonistA knew there was nothing left to do but try to survive 
 ProtagonistA would have to find a way to live with the knowledge that ProtagonistA could have saved the world , but did n't 
 When ProtagonistA was 18 , ProtagonistA decided to move to East Anglia to become a citizen 
 ProtagonistA settled there and started a new life 
 ProtagonistA made new friends and started a new job 
 ProtagonistA was happy in ProtagonistA's new home 
 However , one day , ProtagonistA disappeared and no one knows what happened to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been holding ProtagonistA's tongue for far too long 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being the doormat , the one who always said yes and never complained 
 Today , ProtagonistA was going to speak ProtagonistA's mind 
 ProtagonistA started with ProtagonistB 
 For months , ProtagonistA had been working on a project that was very important to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB kept putting it on the back burner 
 Today , ProtagonistA went into ProtagonistB's office and told ProtagonistB exactly how ProtagonistA felt 
 Next , ProtagonistA tackled ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA sat ProtagonistC down and calmly explained how ProtagonistA's mess was affecting ProtagonistA 
 Finally , ProtagonistA took on ProtagonistA's parents 
 ProtagonistA had always been a good daughter , but ProtagonistA was tired of being treated like a child 
 ProtagonistA sat them down and told them that ProtagonistA was an adult and deserved to be treated as such 
 And ProtagonistA called it ProtagonistA's world 
 ProtagonistA had killed eighty - two thousand four hundred and thirty - one Americans , and had left behind a record so depressing that it might have been sufficient even to establish the minimum standard of civilisation for that epoch 
 ProtagonistA 's a big - shot warlord in the Middle East , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of money , and ProtagonistA 's got some big guns , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of bombs , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of guns 
 But ProtagonistA 's not the only one 
ProtagonistA was on the deck of the great ship , looking up at the sun 
 ProtagonistA could see the other ships in the fleet , all heading towards the sun 
 ProtagonistA felt a sense of excitement and anticipation 
 ProtagonistA was about to witness the most amazing event in the world - the coming of the sun 
ProtagonistA was always a kind and caring person , but you could really tell how great of a person ProtagonistA was by the way ProtagonistA treated ProtagonistA's wife and children 
 ProtagonistA was always so patient and loving with them , no matter what they did or how they acted 
 ProtagonistA was always there for them when they needed ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA always made sure they were happy and comfortable 
 Even when times were tough , ProtagonistA never wavered in ProtagonistA's love and support for ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA was truly an amazing wife and mother , and everyone who knew ProtagonistA could see that 
ProtagonistA was walking through the narrow streets of Copenhagen , carefully avoiding the worst of the traffic 
 ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way to the market to buy some bread and cheese for dinner 
 As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA , also avoiding the traffic 
 ProtagonistA felt a sudden jolt of electricity when their eyes met , and ProtagonistA quickly looked away 
 ProtagonistA hurried to the market , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
 ProtagonistA had never felt that way before , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA bought ProtagonistA's bread and cheese and hurried home , ProtagonistA's mind racing 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who had committed a terrible crime 
 ProtagonistA was so ashamed of what ProtagonistA had done that ProtagonistA did n't want ProtagonistA's body to be discovered 
 So , ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's own life 
 But even in death , ProtagonistA could n't escape ProtagonistA's guilt 
ProtagonistA went into the water and sat there , a pale - faced man , taking in the ship before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so beautiful , ProtagonistB thought , even in the darkness 
In the morning ProtagonistA was asleep , and the roil of ProtagonistA's mind was soothed by a light stream of thought or emotion that it was as if ProtagonistA had drifted off into a dream 
 ProtagonistA dreamed that ProtagonistA was in a beautiful garden , and the sun was shining down on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt so happy and content in the dream that ProtagonistA never wanted to wake up 
 We 're so glad ProtagonistA 're here 
  ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA belonged with ProtagonistA's new family 
 ProtagonistA was happy to finally have a place to call home 
There was once a boy with a very big , very round face and very large eyes and a very small head , but who was much more important than the rest of the boys in the school , and who had played a very important part in ProtagonistB's life , and whose name was William ; and ProtagonistA was a very good , well - behaved boy , and of a very good family , and in a very good school , and was a very useful and useful growth 
 ProtagonistA had been one of ProtagonistB's best friends when they were both little , and ProtagonistA had always been there for ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB needed someone 
 ProtagonistA was the one who had helped ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB was lost in the forest , and ProtagonistA had been the one to comfort ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB was upset 
 ProtagonistA was always there for ProtagonistB , no matter what 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistA disappeared 
 One day , out of the blue , ProtagonistA reappeared 
 ProtagonistA had been away for years , and ProtagonistA had changed 
 ProtagonistA was no longer the same boy that ProtagonistB had known 
 ProtagonistA was taller , and ProtagonistA's face was thinner 
 ProtagonistA looked like a completely different person 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had been travelling the world , and that ProtagonistA had seen and done many amazing things 
 Even though ProtagonistA was different , ProtagonistA was still the same old friend that ProtagonistB had always known 
ProtagonistA had always been a creative soul 
 ProtagonistA loved to express ProtagonistA through art , and ProtagonistA was always looking for new ways to do so 
 When ProtagonistA was younger , ProtagonistA would often go for walks in the woods near ProtagonistA's home and collect leaves and twigs to use in ProtagonistA's collages 
 As ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA began to experiment with other mediums , and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA's true passion in painting 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the woods again , collecting materials for ProtagonistA's latest project 
 ProtagonistA would create a painting using the earth as ProtagonistA's canvas 
 ProtagonistA spent the next few days collecting mud , rocks , and leaves , and ProtagonistA set to work creating ProtagonistA's masterpiece 
 When ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistA stepped back to admire ProtagonistA's work 
 ProtagonistA had always been interested in the medical field , and had even considered becoming a doctor ProtagonistA at one point 
 However , ProtagonistA now saw how little impact doctors really had on the world 
 ProtagonistA had lost all respect for the profession 
ProtagonistA had not known the time when ProtagonistA would die , but it was an unpleasant year for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had been worse for it 
 ProtagonistA had been in and out of the hospital for months , and ProtagonistA's family had been by ProtagonistA's side the whole time 
 ProtagonistA was a strong woman who fought until the very end 
ProtagonistA was making tea for the family when ProtagonistA was startled to discover that ProtagonistB had gone into labour 
 ProtagonistA quickly called for an ambulance and ProtagonistB was rushed to the hospital 
 ProtagonistA was by ProtagonistB's side the whole time , holding ProtagonistB's hand and telling ProtagonistB everything would be alright 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were so grateful , and they knew that this little girl would change their lives forever 
 ProtagonistA was always a sweet girl , always smiling and always eager to help 
 When ProtagonistA was five , ProtagonistA helped me bake cookies for the first time 
 ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's cookies were delicious 
 ProtagonistA has always been a great friend 
 ProtagonistA is now a grown woman with a family of ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA 's still the same sweet , caring person ProtagonistA was when ProtagonistA was a little girl 
ProtagonistA had been walking with ProtagonistA's companion for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting tired 
 ProtagonistA was about to suggest they take a break when ProtagonistA felt something hard and cold touch ProtagonistA's hip 
 ProtagonistA looked down and saw the blade of a large , black - bladed club strapped to ProtagonistA's companion 's hip 
 ProtagonistA did n't have the strength to resist the impulse to run away 
There was once ProtagonistA ; and when ProtagonistA was six , and having already grown into a handsome and somewhat charming boy , and making ProtagonistA happy and prosperous by the exert , ProtagonistA was very much admired by ProtagonistA's friends and acquaintances 
 One day , while out walking with ProtagonistA's father , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was unlike any woman ProtagonistB had ever seen 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistB was charming and persistent 
 ProtagonistA laughed and danced , and ProtagonistA forgot all about ProtagonistA's troubles 
 For the first time in a long time , ProtagonistA felt truly happy 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA agreed 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to leave this magical place , and ProtagonistA did n't want to leave ProtagonistB 
 So ProtagonistA stayed with ProtagonistB , and they sailed away together to a new life 
ProtagonistA has worked hard ProtagonistA's entire life to get to where ProtagonistA is now 
 ProtagonistA 's happy and proud of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knows that all ProtagonistA's hard work has paid off 
ProtagonistA stood upright , staring thoughtfully at the cold , silver plate before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had tried to forget about it , but the memories kept creeping back up , no matter how hard ProtagonistA tried to push them away 
 ProtagonistA had been so young and naive back then , and ProtagonistA had paid the price for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had lost everything that ProtagonistA had loved , and ProtagonistA had never been able to forgive ProtagonistA for it 
 Now , ProtagonistA was staring at the plate again , and ProtagonistA felt the familiar weight of sadness settling on ProtagonistA's heart 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA needed to face ProtagonistA's past , and that ProtagonistA needed to make peace with it 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and reached for the plate 
 ProtagonistA was ready to confront ProtagonistA's demons , and to finally put the past to rest 
ProtagonistA had been using ProtagonistA's hearing to the full when ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been eavesdropping on ProtagonistB's conversations for weeks , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was planning to kill ProtagonistA's mother 
 ProtagonistA could n't let that happen , so ProtagonistA took matters into ProtagonistA's own hands 
 ProtagonistA waited until ProtagonistB was in the shower , and ProtagonistA snuck up behind ProtagonistB with a knife 
 ProtagonistA stabbed ProtagonistB in the back , and ProtagonistB died instantly 
 ProtagonistA's mother was safe , and ProtagonistA was free 
 ProtagonistA loved the way they could transport you to another world , or teach you something new about the one you already lived in 
 ProtagonistA had read countless books and seen countless movies , but it was n't until ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA truly understood the power of stories 
 ProtagonistA started to see the potential for magic and wonder in everyday life 
 ProtagonistA began to tell ProtagonistA's own stories , and ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA had a gift for it 
 ProtagonistA continued to learn from ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA pass on ProtagonistA's knowledge to others 
 ProtagonistA helped people see the beauty and potential in their own lives , and ProtagonistA inspired them to tell their own stories 
ProtagonistA had just before ProtagonistA turned twenty - three had to endure what had hitherto been tolerable physical pain 
 After all , ProtagonistA had a family to take care of 
 ProtagonistA could n't afford to be weak 
 Finally , ProtagonistA made it to the doctor 's office , where ProtagonistA was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer 
 The prognosis was n't good , but ProtagonistA was determined to fight 
 ProtagonistA had to be strong for ProtagonistA's family 
By the time ProtagonistA was nine , ProtagonistA was already burning mad 
 ProtagonistA was mad at ProtagonistA's parents , mad at ProtagonistA's teachers , and mad at the world 
 ProtagonistA was a gifted child who did n't fit in and ProtagonistA knew it 
 ProtagonistA was always getting into trouble and ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA was going to show everyone that ProtagonistA was the best and they were all going to regret ever doubting ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been in a coma for weeks , ever since the car accident 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA's family was shocked that ProtagonistA was awake , but they did n't know what to say when ProtagonistA told them what ProtagonistA had done 
 ProtagonistA was still weak from the coma , but ProtagonistA was determined to get better 
 ProtagonistA knew that the transplant had been a mistake and that ProtagonistA had to get rid of it if ProtagonistA ever wanted to be truly well again 
 ProtagonistA had a great life , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like there was something more out there 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to go on a journey to find out what that something was 
 ProtagonistA traveled for a long time , but ProtagonistA never found what ProtagonistA was looking for 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA was never going to find what ProtagonistA was looking for and ProtagonistA turned back around 
 As ProtagonistA was walking back , ProtagonistA saw a rabbit running by and ProtagonistA followed it 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a strange place 
 ProtagonistA saw the rabbit and started to follow it again 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA was looking for something more 
 ProtagonistA thought about this and ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was looking for love 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA went back home 
 ProtagonistA was finally able to find what ProtagonistA was missing and ProtagonistA was happy 
ProtagonistA was a man of extremely high moral character and , although ProtagonistA had the greatest number of notables of every description in the world , besides ProtagonistA's wife and children , was altogether a very poor man 
 ProtagonistA never complained , but went about ProtagonistA's business with a smile on ProtagonistA's face , always helping others when ProtagonistA could 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking when ProtagonistA came across a wallet lying on the ground 
 ProtagonistA picked it up and looked inside to see if there was any ID so ProtagonistA could return it to its owner 
 Instead , ProtagonistA found a large amount of cash 
 ProtagonistA knew it was n't right to keep the money , but ProtagonistA was so tempted 
 ProtagonistA could really use the money to help ProtagonistA's family 
Once , when ProtagonistA was only eleven , ProtagonistA became really bored 
 ProtagonistA had no friends to play with , and ProtagonistA's parents were always busy 
 ProtagonistA thought about what ProtagonistA could do to make ProtagonistA feel better 
 ProtagonistA decided to go on an adventure 
 ProtagonistA went outside and started walking 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA kept walking 
 ProtagonistA walked for hours , until it started to get dark 
 ProtagonistA was getting tired , and ProtagonistA still did n't know where ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA saw a light in the distance and started walking towards it 
 ProtagonistA got to the light and saw that it was a house 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door and a woman answered 
 ProtagonistA stayed at the woman 's house for the night 
 The next day , ProtagonistA walked back home 
 ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA had gone on an adventure , and ProtagonistA learned that ProtagonistA could always find new things to do when ProtagonistA was bored 
ProtagonistA was driving back from the library , listening to the end of a lecture when ProtagonistA was startled to find ProtagonistA in the middle of a city 
 ProtagonistA looked around , confused , until ProtagonistA saw a sign that said  Welcome to Chicago !  ProtagonistA must have taken a wrong turn somewhere 
 ProtagonistA pulled over to the side of the road to get ProtagonistA's bearings 
 ProtagonistA was about to call ProtagonistA's husband to ask for directions when ProtagonistA saw a police car pull up behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA rolled down ProtagonistA's window and asked the officer for help 
 ProtagonistA thanked the officer and drove off 
 ProtagonistA was able to find ProtagonistA's way out of the city and back to ProtagonistA's home 
The night ProtagonistA was arrested , ProtagonistA awoke to find ProtagonistA in a cell with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was just as scared as ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head 
  ProtagonistA do n't know 
 ProtagonistA was just sitting in ProtagonistA's apartment when the police came and took ProtagonistA away 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB continued to talk throughout the night , sharing their stories and their fears 
ProtagonistA had never known the heart of a woman , and ProtagonistA did not even pretend to be surprised at ProtagonistB's romance 
 ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little jealous 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to experience the kind of love that ProtagonistB was now enjoying , but it just seemed to elude ProtagonistA 
 Maybe one day , ProtagonistA thought 
 Maybe one day ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistA's own romance 
 But for now , ProtagonistA was content to be ProtagonistB's friend and confidante , and to share in ProtagonistB's happiness 
ProtagonistA had been planning ProtagonistA's attack on the Montparnasse for weeks 
 ProtagonistA knew that the only way to destroy the place was to breach the roof and let the explosives ProtagonistA had placed inside do their work 
 But ProtagonistA was not going to give up now 
 ProtagonistA stood there , triumphantly , as the Montparnasse was destroyed 
ProtagonistA was going to China , but first ProtagonistA was going to see ProtagonistA's mother 
 The next day , ProtagonistA left for China , but ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistA's mother ProtagonistA would come back to visit soon 
ProtagonistA , once remarked that ProtagonistA was inclined either to be a monster , or to be nothing at all 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure which was worse , to be a monster or to be nothing 
 Either way , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA would lose 
ProtagonistA had been reading aloud from the ' History of the United States of America ' when ProtagonistA noticed a word in a Latin text on the back page 
 ' ProtagonistA was curious about what an expedition was , so ProtagonistA looked it up in the dictionary 
 ProtagonistA read that an expedition is a journey made for a specific purpose , such as exploration or conquest 
ProtagonistA approached the throne upon an armchair not as a king , but as a dandy 
 ProtagonistA was a success , but no more than a short - cut , with ProtagonistB at full term 
 ProtagonistA sat down to lunch , and took a stool in the sofas on the other side of the table 
   ProtagonistA am who ProtagonistA am ,  ProtagonistA said with a shrug 
  And what is it that ProtagonistA want , ProtagonistA ?   ProtagonistA want ProtagonistB to sign this treaty ,  ProtagonistA said , pulling a document out of ProtagonistA's pocket and sliding it across the table 
  ProtagonistA 're very straightforward , are n't ProtagonistA ?   ProtagonistA try to be ,  ProtagonistA said 
  Now , what was it ProtagonistA wanted to ask ProtagonistB ?   Oh , nothing ,  ProtagonistA said , getting to ProtagonistA's feet 
  ProtagonistA just wanted to make sure ProtagonistB were still alive 
 ProtagonistA 'll be on ProtagonistA's way now 
ProtagonistA was a kind and gentle woman who lived a simple life 
 ProtagonistA was content with what ProtagonistA had and did n't want for anything more 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA came across a group of men who were about to kill a deer 
 ProtagonistA begged them to stop and let the deer go , but they would n't listen 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA had to get away 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA came across a small cottage 
 ProtagonistA went inside and hid under the bed 
 From then on , ProtagonistA made it ProtagonistA's mission to help animals in need 
 ProtagonistA became a famous animal rights activist and helped make the world a better place 
 ProtagonistA lived a long and happy life , and died a free woman 
 But ProtagonistA was a fighter 
 ProtagonistA fought and ProtagonistA fought and ProtagonistA fought until ProtagonistA finally took ProtagonistA's first breath 
 ProtagonistA went on to live a long and happy life 
 ProtagonistA was always grateful to be alive and always tried to help others who were fighting for their lives 
ProtagonistA was only six years old when ProtagonistB left for the first time 
 All ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistB was going to be gone for a while and ProtagonistA would have to stay with ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA would often cry ProtagonistA to sleep at night , wondering where ProtagonistB was and if ProtagonistB was ever coming back 
 ProtagonistA would see other families out and about , playing in the snow and having snowball fights , and ProtagonistA would feel so alone 
 From then on , ProtagonistA started to feel a bit better 
 ProtagonistA still missed ProtagonistB terribly but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was doing something important 
 The next winter , ProtagonistA was excited to see ProtagonistB again and give ProtagonistB a big hug 
ProtagonistA did n't share a room with your mom or ProtagonistB or any of that stuff that everybody does 
 ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's own room , and ProtagonistA loved it 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA did n't have ProtagonistA's own space anymore 
 ProtagonistA had to share a room with ProtagonistB , and it was awful 
 But ProtagonistA did n't give up 
 ProtagonistA kept fighting for ProtagonistA's own space , and eventually , ProtagonistA won 
 ProtagonistA got ProtagonistA's own room back , and ProtagonistA was happier than ever 
ProtagonistA lay in ProtagonistA's white cotton dress , looking out through the bars at the stars overhead , and ProtagonistB ; and all the life of the world was passing before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been in prison for so long , ProtagonistA could not remember how it had happened 
 ProtagonistA only knew that ProtagonistA was innocent , and that no one would believe ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had given up hope of ever getting out , until one day , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA's cell 
 As ProtagonistA lay on the ground , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing over ProtagonistA , weeping 
 ProtagonistA forgave ProtagonistB , and died with a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
ProtagonistA stands on ProtagonistA's brook and watches the sun set over a wide and blue sea of gold 
 ProtagonistA 's thankful for all the good things in ProtagonistA's life and knows that there are more good things to come 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to visit , but never had the chance 
 Now , ProtagonistA was finally here , and it was everything ProtagonistA 'd hoped for 
 ProtagonistA could hardly wait to explore more of the city 
ProtagonistA had forgotten how long ProtagonistA 'd been in the desert 
 ProtagonistA remembered the last time ProtagonistA had seen water was when ProtagonistA was with ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA had been searching for them for days , and ProtagonistA's water had run out a long time ago 
 ProtagonistA was so thirsty , and ProtagonistA's throat was so dry 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for what felt like forever , and ProtagonistA was starting to lose hope 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA saw something in the distance 
 It was a mirage , ProtagonistA was sure of it 
 But as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized it was real 
 ProtagonistA fell to ProtagonistA's knees and drank from the cool water 
 ProtagonistA had never been so relieved , and ProtagonistA thanked God for leading ProtagonistA to safety 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the foot of a large tree in the shadow of an old oak tree , spreading ProtagonistA's wings 
 ProtagonistA was enjoying the warmth of the sun on ProtagonistA's feathers when ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes 
 ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's head to see a small rabbit step out into the clearing 
 ProtagonistA spread ProtagonistA's wings and flew at the rabbit , grabbing it in ProtagonistA's talons 
 ProtagonistA flew up into the tree and perched on a branch , eating ProtagonistA's lunch 
ProtagonistA laid ProtagonistA's hooves on ProtagonistA's forelegs and stared up at the sky 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything so beautiful 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could reach up and touch it 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could stay there forever and just look at the sky 
ProtagonistA can not be quite sure which was which , but ProtagonistA had seen the end of it 
 In the end , ProtagonistA chose the one that seemed the most logical , the one that would keep ProtagonistA safe 
 ProtagonistA turned away from the other option , the one that would have been so much easier , and walked away 
ProtagonistA reached over to cup ProtagonistA's eyes to see just how dry and teary ProtagonistA's eyes were 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to find that they were actually quite dry , though ProtagonistA's tears had certainly made them wet 
 ProtagonistA wiped them away with ProtagonistA's sleeve and stood up , blinking in the bright sunlight 
ProtagonistA stretched out ProtagonistA's forelegs and rested ProtagonistA's hind legs on the side of ProtagonistA's neck 
 As ProtagonistA rested , ProtagonistA thought about all the places ProtagonistA had been and all the things ProtagonistA had seen 
 ProtagonistA had made so many new friends along the way and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never get bored 
 After a little while , ProtagonistA got up and stretched ProtagonistA's legs before continuing on ProtagonistA's way 
ProtagonistA had been walking in the forest for hours , and ProtagonistA was starting to get tired 
 ProtagonistA had been following ProtagonistB , hoping that ProtagonistB would lead ProtagonistA back home 
 ProtagonistA sat down on a log to rest , and ProtagonistA soon fell asleep 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistA got up and started walking around , trying to find ProtagonistA's way out of the forest 
 But ProtagonistA only got more and more lost 
 ProtagonistA started to cry , and ProtagonistA sat down on the ground , feeling hopeless 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA looked up and saw ProtagonistB , standing at the edge of the forest 
 ProtagonistA was so grateful to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA hugged ProtagonistB and thanked ProtagonistB for finding ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA vowed to never go into the forest again , and ProtagonistA never did 
ProtagonistA had always dreamed of a rainbow , whenever nopony was around to explain it to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA would often lie on ProtagonistA back in the meadow and stare up at the sky , dreaming of the colors dancing in the sky 
 One day , ProtagonistA saw a real rainbow for the first time 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA ran to tell ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA had just been dreaming and that they should all close their eyes and dream of rainbows too 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches , staring into the distance 
 ProtagonistA could see the smoke rising from the chimneys of the village and hear the sound of the children playing 
 ProtagonistA could n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but ProtagonistA knew something was amiss 
 ProtagonistA stood up and began to walk towards the village 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that the houses were in disrepair and the people were thin and ragged 
 As ProtagonistA walked through the village , ProtagonistA saw that the people were listless and apathetic 
 ProtagonistA felt a deep sadness for these people 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what had happened to them , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to help 
 ProtagonistA went from house to house , doing what ProtagonistA could to help 
 ProtagonistA repaired roofs , cooked meals , and tended to the sick 
 ProtagonistA had made a difference 
 ProtagonistA had given these people hope 
ProtagonistA was having a tough day 
 ProtagonistA had been up since the sun rose , and now it was well past noon 
 ProtagonistA was exhausted , and all ProtagonistA wanted to do was take a nap 
 But ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 ProtagonistA had responsibilities 
 ProtagonistA had to take care of the animals 
 ProtagonistA trudged through the barn , doing ProtagonistA best to take care of the animals 
 But ProtagonistA was so tired , ProtagonistA could barely keep ProtagonistA's eyes open 
 Finally , ProtagonistA made it to the cooler 
 ProtagonistA lay down on the floor , propping ProtagonistB's ears up and putting ProtagonistB's hooves on ProtagonistB's head 
 ProtagonistA was just going to rest for a few minutes 
 ProtagonistA was n't going to fall asleep 
 But ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA sat up , wide - eyed , as ProtagonistA saw a figure silhouetted in the doorway 
 Who 's there ?  ProtagonistA called out , ProtagonistA's voice shaking 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 Then , ProtagonistA heard a voice 
 ProtagonistA , it 's ProtagonistB ,  the voice said 
 ProtagonistA relaxed 
 ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB scared ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA smiled 
 ProtagonistA appreciate it 
 ProtagonistA was just taking a quick nap 
 ProtagonistA lay down and closed ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA was safe now 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would always be there to look out for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's own set of sparrow feet 
 ProtagonistA loved them and was always excited to show them off 
 One day , ProtagonistA was playing in ProtagonistA's backyard when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking by 
 ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB and asked if ProtagonistB wanted to see ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistA know you can do it 
 ProtagonistA sighed 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a voice 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA have to believe in ProtagonistA 
 If ProtagonistA do n't believe ProtagonistA can fly , then ProtagonistA never will 
  ProtagonistA just do n't know how 
  ProtagonistA have to find a way to fly from the inside 
 ProtagonistA was going to find a way to fly 
 And ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA was very excited to go and live with them 
 When ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle were very strict 
 ProtagonistA had to stay in ProtagonistA's room all day and could n't go outside 
 ProtagonistA was very bored and unhappy 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to run away 
 ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and left 
 ProtagonistA was finally free and happy 
ProtagonistA was having a wonderful time at the palace 
 ProtagonistA loved spending time with ProtagonistB 
 But one day , ProtagonistA discovered that ProtagonistB had tried to kill ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was scared to confront ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to 
 ProtagonistA forgave ProtagonistB and they remained close cousins 
ProtagonistA was sitting on ProtagonistA's bed , knitting a sweater for Applejack of the Rainbow Dash 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about how much ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's two friends and how they were always there for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that they would love the sweater , but ProtagonistA also knew that they would never ask for it 
 ProtagonistA wanted to make something special for them , something that they could cherish forever 
 ProtagonistA finished the sweater and held it up to the light 
 ProtagonistA could n't wait to give it to ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA knew they would be surprised , but ProtagonistA also knew they would be happy 
 ProtagonistA could n't wait to see the looks on their faces when they opened the gift 
ProtagonistA was a happy child , always smiling and laughing 
 ProtagonistA was the light in ProtagonistA's parents ' lives and they cherished ProtagonistA every moment 
 One day , ProtagonistA came to ProtagonistA's parents and said ProtagonistA wanted to leave 
 ProtagonistA left home and started ProtagonistA's own life 
 ProtagonistA was happy , but ProtagonistA always missed ProtagonistA's parents 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving forward , but ProtagonistA was always grateful for the time ProtagonistA had with them 
ProtagonistA looked down at the floor of ProtagonistA's hooves , at ProtagonistA's feet , and the strands of pink hair hanging above ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA was a little girl , no more than four years old , and ProtagonistA was lost 
 ProtagonistA had been following a white rabbit down a hole , and now ProtagonistA was in some kind of underground tunnel 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard voices 
 ProtagonistA began to follow the voices , and soon ProtagonistA came to a small opening in the wall 
 ProtagonistA peered through , and saw two creatures that ProtagonistA had never seen before 
 But ProtagonistA was too tired to care , and so ProtagonistA lay down and fell asleep 
ProtagonistA was sitting cross - legged on the edge of the porch , ProtagonistA's eyes fixed on the tree closest to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt at peace with the world 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB , standing there 
  Yes ?  ProtagonistA said 
 Oh , just about life in general ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA peered down through the low ceiling of ProtagonistA's office as though ProtagonistA had been watching a war for hours 
 ProtagonistA had seen the fighting begin early that morning , and ProtagonistA had been glued to ProtagonistA's spot ever since 
 ProtagonistA was exhausted , but ProtagonistA could n't tear ProtagonistA away from the scene 
 This was the worst fighting ProtagonistA had ever seen , and ProtagonistA was afraid that it would only get worse 
ProtagonistA stared at the floor , ProtagonistA's eyes darting from one simple idea to another 
 ProtagonistA was trying to think of a way to get out of the situation ProtagonistA was in , but nothing was coming to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been in this room for hours , with no food or water , and ProtagonistA was starting to get desperate 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a key in the door and ProtagonistA quickly stood up , hoping that someone had come to rescue ProtagonistA 
 But when the door opened , ProtagonistA saw that it was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart sink as ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was going to die in this room 
 ProtagonistA tried to think of something , anything , that could help ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was coming up blank 
 ProtagonistA struggled to breathe , ProtagonistA's eyes wide with fear 
 ProtagonistA knew that this was the end , and there was nothing ProtagonistA could do to stop it 
ProtagonistA was sitting on Alice 's book , the one ProtagonistA 'd always been short on 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should n't be reading it , but ProtagonistA could n't help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to visit Wonderland ProtagonistA , and now ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was finally getting ProtagonistA's chance 
 ProtagonistA turned the page eagerly , eager to see what would happen next 
ProtagonistA stood up on ProtagonistA's hooves , and pulled ProtagonistA's head back with one hoof 
 ProtagonistA looked around at the other horses in the field , and then ProtagonistA started to run 
 ProtagonistA ran as fast as ProtagonistA could , and ProtagonistA did n't stop until ProtagonistA reached the other side of the field 
ProtagonistA remembered when ProtagonistA started at Equestria 
 ProtagonistA was a young filly , and ProtagonistA was so excited to be there 
 ProtagonistA met all of the other ponies , and ProtagonistA made new friends 
 ProtagonistA loved going on adventures with ProtagonistA's new friends , and ProtagonistA loved learning new things 
 ProtagonistA was happy at Equestria , and ProtagonistA loved it there 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked out at the moon 
 ProtagonistA thought about all the things ProtagonistA wanted to do and see in ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA felt like anything was possible 
 ProtagonistA was going to make the most of every moment , and ProtagonistA was never going to give up on ProtagonistA's dreams 
ProtagonistA lay down on ProtagonistA's hooves and reached for ProtagonistA's glass of juice 
 ProtagonistA sipped ProtagonistA's juice and closed ProtagonistA's eyes , letting the cool liquid refresh ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA let out a contented sigh and allowed ProtagonistA to drift off to sleep 
 ProtagonistA had just moved in the week before , and was still getting used to the sound of the rain on the roof 
 ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's chair , looking out the window at the rain , when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking down the street 
 ProtagonistA could n't tell who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistB seemed to be coming towards ProtagonistA's house 
 As ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was a woman , and ProtagonistB was carrying a suitcase 
 ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA's new neighbor 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches , contemplating ProtagonistA's drawing card 
 ProtagonistA had been working on it for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally satisfied with the result 
 ProtagonistA had captured the cat 's personality perfectly , and ProtagonistA was sure that everyone who saw it would love it 
 Now , ProtagonistA just had to find the perfect frame for it 
 ProtagonistA wanted something that would really make the picture pop , and ProtagonistA was confident that ProtagonistA would find it 
 After all , ProtagonistA had been an artist for as long as ProtagonistA could remember , and ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA was doing 
 As ProtagonistA walked through the store , ProtagonistA found the perfect frame 
 ProtagonistA could n't wait to get it home and put it on display 
ProtagonistA had been having trouble sleeping for weeks 
 ProtagonistA would lie in bed for hours , tossing and turning , trying to will ProtagonistA to fall asleep 
 But as soon as ProtagonistA would start to drift off , ProtagonistA's mind would start racing and ProtagonistA would be wide awake again 
 ProtagonistA had been lying in bed for hours , staring at the ceiling , when ProtagonistA noticed that the moon had stopped shining 
 ProtagonistA found this odd , but not entirely unexpected 
 After all , ProtagonistA had been having trouble sleeping for weeks 
 ProtagonistA tried to go back to sleep , but ProtagonistA's mind was now racing even more than before 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to the window to see if the moon was still there 
 ProtagonistA looked around , but there was no sign of it anywhere 
 ProtagonistA was about to go back to bed when ProtagonistA heard a noise outside 
 ProtagonistA looked out the window and saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA's house 
 ProtagonistA was about to call out to ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA noticed that ProtagonistB was carrying a large sack 
 ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB walked up to ProtagonistA's house and disappeared inside 
 ProtagonistA was about to go downstairs to see what was going on when ProtagonistA heard a voice 
 ProtagonistA did n't have the moon 
  ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was about to give ProtagonistB the moon when ProtagonistA heard a noise from upstairs 
 ProtagonistA ran upstairs to see what the noise was 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's cat , Mr
 ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief and went back to bed 
 But ProtagonistA could n't sleep 
 ProtagonistA was too confused about what had just happened 
 Had ProtagonistA really seen the moon disappear ? And who was ProtagonistB ? ProtagonistA would find out soon enough 
ProtagonistA was lying in a pool of ProtagonistA's own blood , feeling the life slowly draining out of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was n't going to make it 
 As ProtagonistA lay there , ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's life and all the things ProtagonistA had done 
 ProtagonistA was happy with the life ProtagonistA had lived , and ProtagonistA was at peace knowing that ProtagonistA had done everything ProtagonistA wanted to do 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let go 
 ProtagonistA tried to help ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't get ProtagonistB to stop spinning 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA stayed by ProtagonistB's side for a long time , until finally ProtagonistA had to go on without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA always remembered the day ProtagonistB died 
One day , while watching ProtagonistA's blank expression as it was reflected in a mirror , ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA quite liked it quite a bit 
 How was ProtagonistA going to wear it without looking like an idiot ! ProtagonistA decided to try it out on ProtagonistA's next date with ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA could tell ProtagonistB was taken aback by ProtagonistA's appearance 
  ProtagonistA just smiled and said ,  ProtagonistA know , is n't it great ?  ProtagonistB did n't know what to say , so ProtagonistB just smiled and nodded 
 Throughout the date , ProtagonistA could tell ProtagonistB was uncomfortable , but ProtagonistA did n't mind 
 ProtagonistA was having a great time 
  ProtagonistA just laughed and said ,  That 's fine , ProtagonistA 'm not going anywhere 
ProtagonistA leaned over the balcony of ProtagonistA's apartment , gazing at the seemingly endless blue sky 
 ProtagonistA sighed contently , taking in the scene before ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA swallowed a large melty gulp of ProtagonistA's new favorite drink which was no doubt ProtagonistA's seventh 
 ProtagonistA had been drinking it all day and was feeling a bit buzzed 
 ProtagonistA was sitting on ProtagonistA's porch swing , swaying back and forth , when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking by 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 're looking a bit flushed 
  ProtagonistA 'm fine ,  ProtagonistA replied ,  ProtagonistA just love this new drink 
 ProtagonistA thought about what ProtagonistB said and decided maybe ProtagonistB was right 
 ProtagonistA got up from the swing and went inside to pour ProtagonistA a glass of water 
 But with the support of ProtagonistA's family and friends , ProtagonistA slowly started to heal 
 And although ProtagonistA still misses ProtagonistB every day , ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistB will always be with ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's heart 
ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes 
 ProtagonistA had tried to get ProtagonistA to come upstairs and take a break , but ProtagonistA refused 
 Finally , after hours of pacing , ProtagonistA had an idea 
 ProtagonistA went upstairs and got a cupcake 
 Then ProtagonistA walked back downstairs and held it out to the dragon 
 ProtagonistA never forgot the day when ProtagonistA outsmarted a dragon with a cupcake 
ProtagonistA was working at a dress shop when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB working there 
 ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB was cute and ProtagonistA started to talk to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA waited patiently at the top of the mountain for ProtagonistA's sister 
 ProtagonistA knew that it would take ProtagonistA some time to make the climb , but ProtagonistA was patient 
   That 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA , through the thickets of underbrush , through the smog , through the deep dark , lay in the dimness of ProtagonistB's chambers , ProtagonistA's head on ProtagonistA's hooves 
 ProtagonistA was tired from ProtagonistA's journey and wanted to rest , but ProtagonistA could not 
 ProtagonistA was too excited to see ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistA had not seen ProtagonistB in years , not since ProtagonistA had left for college 
 ProtagonistA remembered ProtagonistB as a kind and gentle girl , always ready to help others 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would be able to help ProtagonistA now 
 ProtagonistA stood up and began to pace 
 ProtagonistA peered out of the window , trying to see ProtagonistB's house in the distance 
 ProtagonistA could not see it , but ProtagonistA knew it was there 
 ProtagonistA was so close , ProtagonistA could almost feel ProtagonistB's presence 
 ProtagonistA began to trot in place , ProtagonistA's hooves making soft thumping sounds on the floor 
 ProtagonistA was getting impatient 
 Finally , ProtagonistA heard footsteps outside the door 
 ProtagonistA froze , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
 ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB's help ,  ProtagonistA said urgently 
  ProtagonistA do n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was hoping ProtagonistB could help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was worried about ProtagonistC and wanted to help , but ProtagonistA did not know how 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could count on ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
One morning , ProtagonistA woke up in the middle of the night , and there was a pony standing over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
  ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA jumped out of bed and followed the pony out of ProtagonistA's house 
 What are ProtagonistA going to do ?  ProtagonistA thought for a moment and then said ,  ProtagonistA 'm going to explore the castle !  So ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA found secret passages and hidden rooms , and ProtagonistA even met a friendly dragon 
 In the end , ProtagonistA had the best adventure ever 
ProtagonistA lay down on ProtagonistA's hooves and reached for ProtagonistA's glass of juice 
 ProtagonistA was tired from a long day of work and wanted to relax 
 ProtagonistA sipped ProtagonistA's juice and closed ProtagonistA's eyes , letting the cool liquid refresh ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA thought about her day and all the things ProtagonistA had to do 
 ProtagonistA was glad to be able to relax now and just enjoy the moment 
ProtagonistA bent down and peered up into the oak tree that sheltered ProtagonistA from the wind 
 ProtagonistA felt so happy and peaceful in this moment , ProtagonistA wanted to stay here forever 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's heels on the edge of a wide open field and peered down into the quiet green valley below 
 ProtagonistA felt a sense of calm come over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA looked at the valley 
 ProtagonistA could see a small stream winding its way through the grass , and the trees were just starting to turn green 
 ProtagonistA felt a sense of joy as ProtagonistA sat there and soaked in the beauty of the scene 
ProtagonistA looked up at the sun , and wondered if ProtagonistA wanted to leave the Equestrian capital anytime soon 
 ProtagonistA had been living in the city for a while , and it was starting to feel a bit stifling 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's friends and ProtagonistA's life here , but sometimes ProtagonistA just wanted to get away from it all 
 Maybe ProtagonistA would take a trip out to the countryside sometime soon 
 It had been a while since ProtagonistA 'd been able to just relax and enjoy nature 
 ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA's friends would understand if ProtagonistA took a few days to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA smiled and decided that , yes , a trip was definitely in order 
 ProtagonistA would start making plans tomorrow 
 For now , ProtagonistA was just going to enjoy the rest of ProtagonistA's day 
ProtagonistA had just finished eating dinner with ProtagonistA's family and was walking down the aisle of the car park of the local church when the first thing ProtagonistA noticed was ProtagonistB looking back at ProtagonistA from the rear window 
 Without thinking any further , ProtagonistA ran over to the car and jumped in 
ProtagonistA had been thinking all day if ProtagonistA 'd ever had the chance to speak to ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up hope when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking down the street 
ProtagonistA was a lot of things , but most ponies did n't know just how kind ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA was always quick to help out a friend in need and ProtagonistA was always lending a listening ear 
 Even though ProtagonistA was always surrounded by ponies , ProtagonistA never felt alone 
 ProtagonistA was always content just being ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had seen no sign of life in days , not even a plant 
 ProtagonistA was beginning to lose hope that ProtagonistA would ever find ProtagonistA's way back home 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance 
 ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace and soon came to a river 
 ProtagonistA collapsed on the bank and drank deeply of the cool water 
 After quenching ProtagonistA's thirst , ProtagonistA looked around and saw a cave on the other side of the river 
 ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA could see a light coming from inside 
 ProtagonistA decided to cross the river and see if there was anyone in the cave 
 ProtagonistA was so tired , ProtagonistA could barely stand 
 ProtagonistA waded into the water and started to swim 
 Halfway across , ProtagonistA felt something grab ProtagonistA's leg and pull ProtagonistA under 
 ProtagonistA struggled to free ProtagonistA , but whatever had ProtagonistA was too strong 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA being pulled further and further down into the darkness 
ProtagonistA had never been a particularly violent person 
 ProtagonistA avoided conflict and preferred to live a peaceful life 
 However , in ProtagonistA's younger and more vulnerable years , ProtagonistA had never held a weapon above ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA thought for sure ProtagonistA was going to die 
 ProtagonistA lifted ProtagonistA's hand and grabbed ProtagonistB's wrist , twisting it until ProtagonistB dropped the knife 
 Then ProtagonistA brought the knife up and stabbed ProtagonistB in the stomach 
 ProtagonistA stood over ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
 ProtagonistA had never felt so alive 
 In that moment , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was capable of so much more than ProtagonistA had ever thought possible 
ProtagonistA sat on a cardboard box in ProtagonistA's hooves and looked up at the stars and the sky 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about how ProtagonistA's life had changed so much in the last few months 
 ProtagonistA had always been a horse , but now ProtagonistA was a human 
 ProtagonistA loved the feeling of the wind in ProtagonistA's hair and the sun on ProtagonistA's skin 
 ProtagonistA loved the way the world smelled and the way the grass felt under ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistA even loved the way humans tasted 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's new life , but ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's old life sometimes 
 ProtagonistA missed the smell of the barn and the feel of the hay 
 ProtagonistA missed the sound of the horses running in the field 
 But ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's new life and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never go back to being a horse 
In the eagerness of ProtagonistA's youth , ProtagonistA had known exactly what ProtagonistA was destined to become 
 ProtagonistA was going to be a famous writer , just like ProtagonistA's idol J
 ProtagonistA was going to have ProtagonistA's own office in a big city , with a view of the skyline 
 ProtagonistA was going to be surrounded by people who loved and respected ProtagonistA 
 And ProtagonistA was going to be happy 
 But as ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA realized that life was n't quite so simple 
 ProtagonistA did n't become a famous writer 
 In fact , ProtagonistA did n't even finish ProtagonistA's novel 
 ProtagonistA ended up working in a coffee shop , and ProtagonistA was happy with that 
 Because ProtagonistA had realized that happiness was n't about achieving your dreams 
One morning , as the sun was leaking its last faint rays , ProtagonistA heard the bell ring 
 ProtagonistA was in the kitchen preparing the breakfast ProtagonistA 'd have for ProtagonistA's grandkids for the holidays 
 ProtagonistA was n't looking out of the kitchen window 
 When ProtagonistA heard the bell , ProtagonistA went to the window to see who it was 
 ProtagonistA signed for it and took it inside 
 ProtagonistA opened it and found a box of chocolates 
 ProtagonistA smiled and went back to the kitchen to finish preparing breakfast 
ProtagonistA peered into the mirror at ProtagonistA's reflection , gem eyes shining with anticipation 
 ProtagonistA was finally going to meet ProtagonistA's online friends in person for the first time 
 ProtagonistA had been talking to them for months , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA knew them already 
 But ProtagonistA was nervous about meeting them in person 
 What if they did n't like ProtagonistA ? What if ProtagonistA did n't like them ? ProtagonistA took a deep breath and told ProtagonistA to relax 
 ProtagonistA was sure of it 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the living room of ProtagonistA's house in the suburbs of Ponyville , the fresh air of ProtagonistA's fresh - pitch garden bringing out blue - green flowers that bloomed all afternoon and remained crisp and green all night 
 The phone beside ProtagonistA's rang , and ProtagonistA picked it up , ProtagonistA's heart already pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
  Hello ?  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's voice trembling 
  Yes ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's knees buckle and ProtagonistA collapsed to the floor , the phone still clutched in ProtagonistA's hand 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
ProtagonistA was in the middle of an assignment when all of a sudden , ProtagonistA had the appearance of a forty - year - old animal 
 ProtagonistA was so shocked that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA tried to continue working , but it was hard to concentrate with ProtagonistA's new appearance 
 ProtagonistA decided to go to the mirror to take a look at ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's reflection , ProtagonistA gasped 
 ProtagonistA was a cat ! ProtagonistA did n't know how this had happened , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to find a way to change back 
 ProtagonistA tried to think of anything that could help ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was drawing a blank 
 ProtagonistA was starting to feel panicked when ProtagonistA remembered that ProtagonistA had seen a show about this once 
 So , ProtagonistA took a deep breath and imagined ProtagonistA as a human 
 ProtagonistA felt a tingling sensation all over ProtagonistA's body and when ProtagonistA looked in the mirror again , ProtagonistA was back to normal 
 ProtagonistA was so relieved that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA decided to go to bed and try to forget about the whole incident 
ProtagonistA was riding ProtagonistB down Mount Fouladuddy when it happened 
 ProtagonistA was having a quite a pleasant ride when ProtagonistB suddenly stopped and would not move 
 ProtagonistA tried everything ProtagonistA could think of , but ProtagonistB just would n't budge 
 ProtagonistA was starting to get worried when ProtagonistA heard a voice behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistC 
  Yes ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistC and continued on ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA was amazed at what had just happened and grateful for ProtagonistC's help 
ProtagonistA sat down on the edge of the desk , and looked around for ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA saw them sitting in a circle around the teacher 's desk , laughing and joking with each other 
 ProtagonistA felt a pang of jealousy 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could be like them , carefree and happy 
 But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't 
 ProtagonistA had to be strong , for ProtagonistA's family 
ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistA 'd be better off dead 
 ProtagonistA had been through so much pain and suffering in ProtagonistA's life that ProtagonistA could n't take it anymore 
 ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's husband , ProtagonistA's children , ProtagonistA's job , and ProtagonistA's home 
 ProtagonistA was all alone in the world and ProtagonistA could n't see any way out 
 ProtagonistA was tired of fighting , tired of being alive 
 So , ProtagonistA made a decision 
 ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistA's own life 
 ProtagonistA would end ProtagonistA's pain once and for all 
 ProtagonistA wrote a note , saying goodbye to the world , and then ProtagonistA took a bottle of pills 
 ProtagonistA lay down in ProtagonistA's bed and waited to die 
 ProtagonistA was still alive , and ProtagonistA's pain was still there 
 ProtagonistA was even more alone now , and ProtagonistA had no idea what to do 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA loved spending time outside , especially when the sun was shining 
 Today , ProtagonistA was enjoying the warmth of the sun on ProtagonistA's fur while ProtagonistA sat cross - legged on the ground , resting ProtagonistA's hooves on the back of ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let out a contented sigh , feeling the grass tickle ProtagonistA's belly 
 ProtagonistA was so relaxed that ProtagonistA did n't even hear the approach of the other animals until they were right next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw a rabbit , a squirrel , and a bird all looking at ProtagonistA with confusion 
 I'm just enjoying the sun ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA just shrugged and went back to enjoying the sun 
 ProtagonistA did n't care what the other animals thought of ProtagonistA ; ProtagonistA was happy just being ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA got up before dawn and stepped away from the distractions of ProtagonistA's city 
 ProtagonistA walked for hours , enjoying the peace and quiet of the early morning 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , unsure if ProtagonistA should go in , but then ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name 
 It sounded like ProtagonistA's mother 's voice , so ProtagonistA followed it 
 ProtagonistA walked for what felt like hours , until ProtagonistA came to a clearing 
 ProtagonistA walked to the tree and hugged ProtagonistA's mother tightly 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had finally found ProtagonistA's way home 
ProtagonistA lay down on ProtagonistA's hooves and reached for ProtagonistA's glass of juice 
 ProtagonistA sipped ProtagonistA's juice and closed ProtagonistA's eyes , letting the cool liquid refresh ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA sighed and let ProtagonistA's mind wander , thinking about all the things ProtagonistA had to do tomorrow 
 Soon , ProtagonistA was asleep , dreaming of a world where ProtagonistA did n't have to worry about anything 
ProtagonistA was asleep and thinking about food when ProtagonistA awoke to the sound of hooves approaching from behind the deep , dark , still trees of Equestria 
 ProtagonistA sat up and rubbed ProtagonistA's eyes , expecting to see one of ProtagonistA's pony friends coming to wake ProtagonistA up for a morning adventure 
 Instead , ProtagonistA saw a large , dark horse standing in the shadows , watching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA gasped and scrambled to ProtagonistA's feet , but the horse was gone as quickly as it had appeared 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and tried to tell ProtagonistA it was just a dream , but ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that something was watching ProtagonistA from the darkness 
ProtagonistA had had enough of telling ProtagonistA's mother 's story for a while now 
 ProtagonistA was tired of reliving the past and reliving ProtagonistA's mother 's pain 
 ProtagonistA wanted to move on with ProtagonistA's life and start fresh 
 So , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA's mother that ProtagonistA was done telling ProtagonistA's story 
 ProtagonistA was ready to move on 
ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistA 'd be better off dead 
 ProtagonistA had been through so much pain and suffering in ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA just could n't take it anymore 
 ProtagonistA was tired of fighting and just wanted to give up 
 So , ProtagonistA decided to take ProtagonistA's own life 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to leave ProtagonistA's loved ones behind , but ProtagonistA thought it was the best thing for them 
 ProtagonistA did n't want them to have to see ProtagonistA suffer anymore 
 So , ProtagonistA took a bunch of pills and went to sleep 
 ProtagonistA never woke up again 
ProtagonistA smiled as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistA's father wash his hands in the sink , then rise to the counter and give ProtagonistB a knowing nod 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA's father approved of ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was glad 
 ProtagonistA denied the charges , but the evidence against ProtagonistA was overwhelming 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and watched from behind the large , open window of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been following ProtagonistB for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had first seen ProtagonistB at the market 
 ProtagonistA had saved up all ProtagonistA's money and was now ready to make an offer 
 ProtagonistA just had to wait for the right moment 
 ProtagonistA quickly saddled up ProtagonistA's own horse and rode over to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA then led ProtagonistB back to ProtagonistB's stall and made ProtagonistB an offer 
 ProtagonistB was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistA was adamant 
 ProtagonistA promised to take good care of ProtagonistB and even offered to pay more than the asking price 
 ProtagonistA was over the moon 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA now owned ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA vowed to take good care of ProtagonistB and give ProtagonistB the best life possible 
ProtagonistA stood up and stretched out ProtagonistA's forelegs 
 ProtagonistA had seen so many places and met so many interesting people 
 ProtagonistA was looking forward to finally reaching ProtagonistA's destination 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's home in the forest 
 ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way to the city , where ProtagonistA had always dreamed of living 
 ProtagonistA was getting closer and closer every day , and ProtagonistA could hardly wait to see it 
 One day , as ProtagonistA was walking along , ProtagonistA came to a fork in the road 
 ProtagonistA stopped for a moment , unsure of which way to go 
 ProtagonistA was about to take the left path , when ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name 
 I'm on ProtagonistA's way to the city ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have the company , and ProtagonistA followed the Rabbit down the path 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistA's friend , and then ProtagonistA went off to explore ProtagonistA's new home 
ProtagonistA had seen the white sapland before , but ProtagonistA had n't known what it was , or why people did what they did 
 ProtagonistA had always thought it was a place for madmen and women , a place where people went to forget who they were 
 But now ProtagonistA knew the truth 
 And ProtagonistA was going to find ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA cast the last of ProtagonistA's net on ProtagonistB's second moon , soaring high above the likeness of an alder - maiden in the deep , silent night 
 ProtagonistA had been tracking ProtagonistB for weeks , and ProtagonistA knew that this was ProtagonistA's opportunity to finally catch ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was a notoriously elusive creature , and ProtagonistA was determined to be the one to capture ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had set ProtagonistA's sights on ProtagonistB's moon and had been patiently waiting for ProtagonistA's chance 
 When ProtagonistB finally appeared , ProtagonistA was ready 
 ProtagonistA cast ProtagonistA's net and waited for ProtagonistB to be ensnared 
ProtagonistA rode into the door of the guild hall and pulled ProtagonistA's whip out of ProtagonistA's saddlebag 
 ProtagonistA was a bounty hunter , and ProtagonistA had just captured ProtagonistA's latest target 
 ProtagonistA walked into the hall and tied ProtagonistA's target to a chair 
 ProtagonistA then went to the bounty board and collected ProtagonistA's reward 
 It is a mystery to many who understand the nature of things , that ProtagonistA shines so pale in summer , and so bright in winter , and so clear in the summer , that ProtagonistA sometimes appears to be cradling a corn - field in ProtagonistA's arms 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the bank , searching for ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA had been playing with them near the river when ProtagonistA got separated 
 ProtagonistA called out their names , but there was no answer 
 ProtagonistA was just about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a voice 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the couch in the living room of a house in the middle of nowhere , drinking a glass of water which ProtagonistA hoped would last through the night 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , ever since ProtagonistA had been kicked out of ProtagonistA's home with nothing but the clothes on ProtagonistA's back 
 ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was going , or what ProtagonistA was going to do when ProtagonistA got there 
 ProtagonistA had been living off of rain water and whatever food ProtagonistA could find in the forest , but ProtagonistA's supplies were running low 
 ProtagonistA was weak and exhausted , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would n't be able to make it much further 
 ProtagonistA had been debating whether or not to just give up and lay down to die , when ProtagonistA had come across this house in the middle of nowhere 
 ProtagonistA had found a glass and some water in the kitchen , and ProtagonistA had been sitting on the couch ever since , trying to decide what to do next 
 ProtagonistA was so tired , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would n't be able to keep ProtagonistA's eyes open much longer 
 ProtagonistA decided to lay down and see if ProtagonistA could get some rest , even if it was just for a little while 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what was going to happen to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was too tired to care 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let ProtagonistA drift off to sleep 
ProtagonistA had taken a rest from ProtagonistA's long and busy life , and now that ProtagonistA was free of the cares of being a wife and mother , ProtagonistA was content to enjoy the moment of happiness which ProtagonistA had prepared for just such an occasion 
 ProtagonistA had a cup of tea and a book , and ProtagonistA was just about to settle in when ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door 
 ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and there was ProtagonistB there , who looked to be about the same age as ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was surprised , but ProtagonistA was also very happy to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's own life 
 ProtagonistA was kind and sweet and always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA would often imagine what their life would be like and what they would do together 
 ProtagonistA would daydream about going on adventures and exploring new places with them 
 ProtagonistA was always so happy in ProtagonistA's dreams and ProtagonistA knew that one day ProtagonistA would find the perfect place to live happily ever after 
ProtagonistA stood up and brushed ProtagonistA's bangs off ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA had been sitting in the same spot for far too long and ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA did n't get up and start moving , ProtagonistA would never get anywhere 
 ProtagonistA had a goal and ProtagonistA was determined to reach it 
 So ProtagonistA started walking 
 ProtagonistA walked for hours , never stopping for a break 
 ProtagonistA was getting tired , but ProtagonistA pushed on 
 ProtagonistA was n't going to give up 
 Finally , ProtagonistA reached ProtagonistA's destination 
 ProtagonistA had made it 
 ProtagonistA had achieved ProtagonistA's goal 
 ProtagonistA was exhausted , but ProtagonistA was also triumphant 
 ProtagonistA had done it 
ProtagonistA stood in the shadow of ProtagonistA's mother 's dusty glass cabinet , ProtagonistA's hooves hanging down on the peg to keep ProtagonistA right eye steady 
 ProtagonistA was looking at the family portrait that hung on the wall 
 ProtagonistA remembered the day it was taken 
 ProtagonistA felt a tear run down ProtagonistA's cheek , and ProtagonistA quickly wiped it away 
 ProtagonistA did n't want ProtagonistB to see ProtagonistA crying 
ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes and ProtagonistA was pissed 
 ProtagonistA had been long and rambling , and had a lot to address 
 ProtagonistA started with the usual things , like making me eat all the frosting off the cupcakes or making me sit in the middle of the room while ProtagonistA ate them all in front of me 
 But then ProtagonistA started getting creative 
 ProtagonistA would put the cupcakes in my shoes or in my bed , so that I would have to sleep with them 
 ProtagonistA would hide them in my clothes so that I would find them when I went to put them on 
 Once , ProtagonistA even put one in my toilet 
 But ProtagonistA just laughed and said that I should be grateful that ProtagonistA was even giving me the cupcakes in the first place 
 I was about to tell ProtagonistA off when I realized that ProtagonistA was right 
 After all , ProtagonistA was my best friend and ProtagonistA would never really hurt me 
ProtagonistA watched from the front porch as ProtagonistA's parents put the finishing touches to their house 
 Even though ProtagonistA was now an adult , and lived in ProtagonistA's own home , ProtagonistA still felt a sense of comfort and safety when ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's parents ' house 
 ProtagonistA knew that no matter what happened in ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA's parents would always be there for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was one of the most distinguished ladies of the abbey of St
 ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's late baccus the eldest of the four daughters of the house 
 Though ProtagonistA's mother and grandmother had been very obscure in their regard to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had often thought ProtagonistA's grandfather a pretty poor particular , but in ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA had been extremely wretched , and altogether destitute of everything ProtagonistA should have been able to procure for ProtagonistA 
 And after ProtagonistA's grandmother 's death , being very deprived of money , and very poor indeed , ProtagonistA had nothing but ProtagonistA's imagination in ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was on the pedestal of ProtagonistB's bed , drooping down and frowning as ProtagonistA stared up at the stars 
 ProtagonistA was too worried about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had tried to talk to ProtagonistB about it , but ProtagonistB just brushed ProtagonistA off 
 ProtagonistA was starting to get worried that something was really wrong 
 When ProtagonistA finally noticed ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA jumped up in surprise 
 Yeah , ProtagonistA could n't sleep either 
 ProtagonistA was just thinking about ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was staring up at ProtagonistA's book , dazed and wondering when ProtagonistA would get the chance to finish it 
 ProtagonistA had been meaning to read it for months , but it always got pushed to the back of ProtagonistA's mind in favor of other things 
 But now , as ProtagonistA stared up at the book , ProtagonistA made a decision 
 ProtagonistA was going to finish it , no matter what 
 Even if it meant staying up all night , ProtagonistA was going to read until ProtagonistA reached the end 
 And so , with a new determination , ProtagonistA opened the book and began to read 
ProtagonistA was twelve years old when ProtagonistA was first put in the cage 
 ProtagonistA was small for ProtagonistA's age , and the cage was too tight for ProtagonistA to stand up in 
 ProtagonistA had to crouch down , and the heavy metal bars pressed into ProtagonistA's skin 
 ProtagonistA could hear the other children laughing and playing , but ProtagonistA was never able to see them 
 After a while , ProtagonistA stopped trying to see outside 
 ProtagonistA stopped trying to talk to the other children 
 ProtagonistA stopped trying to do anything 
 ProtagonistA just sat in the darkness , waiting for someone to come and let ProtagonistA out 
 Baudinot , who had been Assistant - Governor of North America , had the honour of hearing that in the year 1779 a new and very considerable controversy had arisen between ProtagonistA and England ; and that ProtagonistA had a right to treat with great violence , or to abandon the laws , that were established under their former alliance , upon the rights of which ProtagonistA was , as ProtagonistA claims , the first and foremost citizen , and as ProtagonistA had been ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA was first formed , but as a subject , when they had embraced the crown of England , and had established the rights of citizens , which , however , they did not abandon , till after their union , but continued to regard as alien , and uncertain 
ProtagonistA was standing there in the shade of the window of ProtagonistA's mother 's office , watching ProtagonistA's mother 's house burn down 
 ProtagonistA could see the flames leaping up into the sky , and the smoke billowing out from the windows 
 ProtagonistA was the only one who knew what had happened 
ProtagonistA lay down in ProtagonistA's little garden and turned ProtagonistA's head to the west 
 ProtagonistA could see the sun setting behind the trees and the sky turning a beautiful orange 
 ProtagonistA felt so peaceful and happy lying there in the grass 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let out a deep sigh 
 ProtagonistA had always been the more outgoing of the two , and ProtagonistA's sister 's death had hit ProtagonistA hard 
 ProtagonistA went out that day and did everything ProtagonistA's sister loved to do 
 ProtagonistA went for a long walk in the woods , ate ProtagonistA's favorite foods , and even went dancing 
 And ProtagonistA knew that 's what ProtagonistA's sister would want 
ProtagonistA sat on the deck and watched over the sea of stars that stretched out before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt so small and insignificant compared to the vastness of the universe , but ProtagonistA also felt a sense of wonder and awe at the beauty of it all 
 ProtagonistA sat there for hours , just watching and marveling at the night sky 
When ProtagonistA first met ProtagonistA's cruel and unhappy fate , ProtagonistA was as young as a pegasus 
 But , as ProtagonistA was then called , ProtagonistA was one of the bravest and most lovely princesses ever to sit upon the throne of Ages 
 As brave and beautiful as a bull in a stallion , ProtagonistA was the envy of all the other princesses 
 But ProtagonistA was not to be defeated 
 ProtagonistA made a magical mirror , and through it ProtagonistA could see the world outside 
 ProtagonistA saw the other princesses , living their happy lives , and it made ProtagonistA even more determined to break free from ProtagonistA's prison 
 One day , ProtagonistA finally managed to escape 
 The witch was hot on ProtagonistA's heels , but ProtagonistA was faster 
 ProtagonistA made it to the safety of a nearby kingdom , where ProtagonistA was welcomed with open arms 
 ProtagonistA eventually found true love , and ProtagonistA's story became an inspiration to all who heard it 
ProtagonistA sat on the porch , rocking back and forth in ProtagonistA's rocking chair , looking out over the grounds of ProtagonistA's beloved family estate in the village of Valance 
 ProtagonistA had lived there ProtagonistA's whole life and loved it dearly 
 ProtagonistA was proud of ProtagonistA's heritage and loved to share stories of ProtagonistA's ancestors with anyone who would listen 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the other side of the estate 
 ProtagonistA got up from ProtagonistA's rocking chair and walked over to the edge of the porch to see what was going on 
 To ProtagonistA's surprise , ProtagonistA saw a group of people walking towards the house 
 ProtagonistA wondered who they could be and what they wanted 
 ProtagonistA did n't recognize any of them , but they looked friendly enough 
 As they got closer , ProtagonistA saw that they were all wearing uniforms 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could n't let them take ProtagonistA's beloved home away from ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA would have to fight for it ! 
 ProtagonistA was always like this , always pushing ProtagonistA to the limit 
 But today , ProtagonistA was extra determined 
 ProtagonistA did n't even slow down , ProtagonistA just kept going 
 ProtagonistA was always pushing me to be better and today was no different 
  Can ProtagonistB hear ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistA asked , desperation in ProtagonistA's voice 
  ProtagonistA put ProtagonistA's head in ProtagonistA's hands and wept 
A little over a year ago , ProtagonistA made the decision to go back to ProtagonistA's kingdom 
 ProtagonistA was tired of living in the city and wanted to be back in the countryside where ProtagonistA felt most at home 
 ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things and said goodbye to ProtagonistA's friends , promising to keep in touch 
 ProtagonistA was happy to be home and settled back into ProtagonistA's old life quickly 
 ProtagonistA 's glad ProtagonistA made the decision to come home and is looking forward to many more years in ProtagonistA's kingdom 
ProtagonistA stood facing the sky and said ,  Okay , that 's enough of this ,  and ProtagonistA should have known better than to ask for a better answer 
 ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA back on the sky and started walking 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA had to 
 ProtagonistA had come too far to turn back now 
 ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA would never leave 
 ProtagonistA kept walking until ProtagonistA came to a door 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA knew , but ProtagonistA knew that this door would lead ProtagonistA to where ProtagonistA needed to go 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and stepped through 
ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's room and stepped out into the living room of ProtagonistA's hooves 
 ProtagonistA was a young woman , barely out of ProtagonistA's teens , and still living at home with ProtagonistA's parents 
 ProtagonistA had the house to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA walked to the kitchen and made ProtagonistA a cup of coffee 
 Then ProtagonistA sat down on the couch and turned on the TV 
 ProtagonistA flipped through the channels , looking for something to watch 
 ProtagonistA settled on a movie and watched it for a while 
 After a while , ProtagonistA got up and went to the bathroom 
 When ProtagonistA came back , ProtagonistA noticed that the coffee had made her hooves wet 
 ProtagonistA got up and went to the kitchen to get a towel 
 When ProtagonistA got back to the living room , ProtagonistA saw that the coffee had made a mess on the couch 
 ProtagonistA sighed and cleaned it up 
 Then ProtagonistA went back to watching ProtagonistA's movie 
ProtagonistA pulled ProtagonistA's head from the ground and looked skyward , feeling the warmth of the sun on ProtagonistA's forehead 
 ProtagonistA had been lying in the grass for hours , just staring up at the clouds and letting ProtagonistA's mind wander 
 ProtagonistA got up and brushed the dirt off ProtagonistA's clothes , then set off down the path , not knowing where ProtagonistA was going , but trusting that ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistA's way 
ProtagonistA had always been a very pale girl , so when ProtagonistA found the diamond ProtagonistA's skin turned an even brighter shade of white 
 At first , ProtagonistA was scared , but then ProtagonistA realized that the diamond had only cut off ProtagonistA's hair and not ProtagonistA's head 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the grass , watching the ponies ProtagonistA loved die 
 ProtagonistA had been with them since they were born , and now they were gone 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to go on without them 
 Deep down , ProtagonistA was a hostile person who was always looking for a fight 
 ProtagonistA was in a good mood too and ProtagonistA was enjoying the company 
 ProtagonistA thought the whole situation was hilarious 
 ProtagonistA was always looking for the next thrill , no matter how dangerous it might be 
ProtagonistA sat on the bank and stretched out ProtagonistB's hooves before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was a beautiful horse , and ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's owner 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB very much , and ProtagonistA was very grateful to have ProtagonistB 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was brushing ProtagonistB's coat , ProtagonistA found a grey hair 
 ProtagonistA was shocked , because ProtagonistA had never seen a grey hair on ProtagonistB before 
 ProtagonistA knew that this meant that ProtagonistB was getting old , and ProtagonistA was very sad about it 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's garden , enjoying the last of the twilight 
 ProtagonistA had half - eaten an apple and was idly tossing the core into the bushes when ProtagonistA saw a movement out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB sitting on ProtagonistB's haunches , looking at ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's bright eyes 
 ProtagonistA was startled , but not afraid 
 ProtagonistA simply nodded and held out the apple 
 ProtagonistA had never met a talking rabbit before , and ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA never would again 
 ProtagonistA sat for a long time , thinking about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA fell for the first time in ProtagonistA's life when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA soon realized that ProtagonistB was never going to do anything for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB and was willing to do anything for ProtagonistB 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was only in love with the idea of ProtagonistB and not the reality of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA broke up with ProtagonistB and never looked back 
 ProtagonistA had been training for this moment for years and ProtagonistA was not going to let anything stop ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was the best in the world and ProtagonistA was going to prove it 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who loved to explore 
 ProtagonistA would often go on adventures in ProtagonistA's backyard , or in the nearby woods 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to go on a horseback ride 
 ProtagonistA had never ridden a horse before , but ProtagonistA was determined to learn 
 With the help of ProtagonistA's parents , ProtagonistA was able to saddle up and ride off into the sunset 
 ProtagonistA bounced between shades of grey , Weiss Sun and Moon , and the occasional pink - and - white sea of sky that ProtagonistA had thrown up in ProtagonistA's wake 
 ProtagonistA sat atop ProtagonistA's saddle and eyed the horizon from a vantage point of a single golden star 
 ProtagonistA rode for hours , until ProtagonistA finally came to a stop at a small pond 
 ProtagonistA dismounted ProtagonistA's horse and walked to the edge of the pond 
 ProtagonistA sat down and watched the stars reflect off the surface of the water 
 ProtagonistA too , ProtagonistB ,  gushed ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's eyes sparkling as ProtagonistA turned the thick chain of grass around ProtagonistA to the side 
  ProtagonistA 'll be careful 
 But even as ProtagonistA said it , ProtagonistA felt something snake around ProtagonistA's leg , tripping ProtagonistA up 
 ProtagonistA yelped in surprise as ProtagonistA fell , and ProtagonistB came galloping over 
 ProtagonistA sat up , and the first thing ProtagonistA saw was the huge , gaping mouth of a snake , ready to strike 
ProtagonistA was a princess who lived in a time when the royal family was nominally hereditary 
 However , in those days , it was not uncommon for ProtagonistA to have electoral rights , even though there was never any reason to suppose that ProtagonistA was anything more than a princess 
ProtagonistA sat up , leaned forward to see the sky and ProtagonistA's Pony Ghost hovering just out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye 
 ProtagonistA remembered the stories ProtagonistA's grandmother used to tell ProtagonistA about the Pony Ghost and how it would come to take children away if they were n't good 
 ProtagonistA had always been a good girl , but ProtagonistA had never seen the Pony Ghost before 
 ProtagonistA did n't know , but ProtagonistA was sure that the Pony Ghost was real and it was watching ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been feeling off all day 
 ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that something bad was going to happen 
 So when ProtagonistA was walking to the Reynolds house to fetch a glass of water in the middle of the night and ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the parlor , ProtagonistA knew something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA walked into the room and saw ProtagonistB standing over the body of ProtagonistB's wife with a bloody knife in ProtagonistB's hand 
 ProtagonistA gasped and ProtagonistB turned around , seeing ProtagonistA in the doorway 
 ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB's footsteps pounding after ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was faster 
 ProtagonistA made it to the front door and ran out into the night 
 ProtagonistA ran all the way home and told ProtagonistA's parents what had happened 
ProtagonistA sat down on the grass , ProtagonistA's hooves lightly tapping the dirt 
 ProtagonistA looked around at the beautiful day and sighed 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to be out in the fresh air and sunshine 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let the warm sun wash over ProtagonistA 
When ProtagonistA was twelve , in the early summer of that year , ProtagonistA had this dream 
 ProtagonistA dreamed that ProtagonistA was walking through a beautiful garden 
 ProtagonistA walked for a while , and then ProtagonistA came to a door 
 On the other side , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a dark forest 
 ProtagonistA was scared , and ProtagonistA ran back to the door 
 ProtagonistA started to cry , and then ProtagonistA woke up 
ProtagonistA was always sitting on ProtagonistB's lap , looking up at the sky 
 ProtagonistA was never quite sure how old ProtagonistA was , but ProtagonistA always felt younger when ProtagonistA was with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's anchor in the world 
 But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would want ProtagonistA to keep looking up at the sky 
 Every day , ProtagonistA would sit on ProtagonistB's lap , even though ProtagonistB was no longer there 
 And ProtagonistA would look up at the sky , and ProtagonistA would feel ProtagonistB's presence with ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA stroked ProtagonistA's lower lip and watched , ProtagonistA's eyes darting across the sky , ProtagonistA's eyes trained on the alicorn 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything so beautiful in all ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA felt a sudden urge to touch the alicorn , to feel its silky fur 
 ProtagonistA reached out ProtagonistA's hand , but the alicorn was gone , vanishing into the clouds 
 ProtagonistA sighed and lowered ProtagonistA's hand , a small smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget the alicorn , and the feeling of wonder it had inspired in ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had always loved flying 
 As a child , ProtagonistA would run through fields and pretend ProtagonistA was a bird 
 ProtagonistA would spread ProtagonistA's arms wide and flap ProtagonistA's little hands as fast as ProtagonistA could , imagining the wind rushing through ProtagonistA's feathers 
 Even now , as an adult , ProtagonistA still loved the feeling of soaring through the air 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to take a break from ProtagonistA's busy life and go for a fly 
 ProtagonistA found a quiet spot in a field , sat down on the ground , and closed ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA let ProtagonistA's wings flap free , feeling the warm sun on ProtagonistA's face and the fresh air in ProtagonistA's lungs 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the grass 
 ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes to see a snake slithering towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA froze in fear , but the snake was already upon ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to act fast 
 ProtagonistA flapped ProtagonistA's wings with all ProtagonistA's might and took off into the air , the snake still clinging to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA flew higher and higher , until the snake finally let go 
 ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief and flew back to ProtagonistA's life , feeling grateful for ProtagonistA's wings 
 ProtagonistA was a young woman of great beauty , intelligence , and strength of character 
 ProtagonistA was also a woman of great faith , and it was this faith that sustained ProtagonistA through the many trials and tribulations ProtagonistA faced in ProtagonistA's short life 
 When ProtagonistA was sixteen , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA continued to write to ProtagonistC , and they continued to meet in secret 
 ProtagonistA was alone in the world , but ProtagonistA did not despair 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistA was determined to find a way to be with ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA went to the city of Traver , where ProtagonistA found a job as a maid in a wealthy household 
 ProtagonistA worked hard and saved ProtagonistA's money , and finally ProtagonistA had enough to buy a ticket to ProtagonistD 
 When ProtagonistA arrived in ProtagonistD , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was a woman of great courage and strength 
 ProtagonistA faced many challenges in ProtagonistA's life , but ProtagonistA never gave up on ProtagonistA's love for ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA is an inspiration to us all 
ProtagonistA woke up on the morning of the day Twilight never gives a flying fuck about what kingdom ProtagonistA's ancestors ruled 
 ProtagonistA yawned and stretched and got out of bed 
 ProtagonistA went to the bathroom and brushed ProtagonistA's teeth and then went downstairs 
 ProtagonistA ate breakfast and then went outside 
 ProtagonistA saw a rabbit and followed it 
 ProtagonistA ended up at a big house 
 ProtagonistA went inside and met Twilight 
 ProtagonistA went home and went to bed 
 The next day , ProtagonistA woke up and it was the day Twilight never gives a flying fuck about what kingdom ProtagonistA's ancestors ruled 
 ProtagonistA turned and ran towards the sound , and as ProtagonistA got closer ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB's figure on the horizon 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was finally home 
ProtagonistA was in a state of great agitation when ProtagonistA discovered the Hare of the Woods 
 ProtagonistA related the story to the reader in a trite and somewhat agitated manner , making it clear that ProtagonistA was very upset by the discovery 
 ProtagonistA described it as being a large , white , furry creature with long ears and red eyes 
 It was unlike any animal ProtagonistA had ever seen before and ProtagonistA was sure that it was going to kill ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was standing on the street with ProtagonistA's back to the house , looking up at the huge dark building which , between ProtagonistA's legs , was partially illuminated by the darkness of the night 
 ProtagonistA was wondering what it would be like to live in a place like that , when ProtagonistA heard a voice behind ProtagonistA 
 Hey , what are ProtagonistA ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistB standing there , looking at ProtagonistA with a mix of confusion and concern 
 I'm just looking at the building ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA shrugged 
  ProtagonistA guess so 
 ProtagonistA nodded 
  ProtagonistB 're right , ProtagonistA should go 
 ProtagonistA turned to walk away , but ProtagonistB stopped ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA nodded 
 As ProtagonistA closed the door , ProtagonistA could n't help but wonder if ProtagonistA would ever see that building again 
Even at thirteen years of age , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was destined to one day become the dominant personality in ProtagonistA's line of work 
 When ProtagonistA was sixteen , ProtagonistA got ProtagonistA's first job in a law office 
 ProtagonistA was a quick learner and soon became the go - to person for research and writing briefs 
 By the time ProtagonistA was twenty - one , ProtagonistA was running the show 
 ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's element 
 ProtagonistA loved the challenge of the work and the satisfaction of winning cases 
 ProtagonistA was on top of the world 
ProtagonistA was taking a leisurely stroll through the woods when ProtagonistA suddenly fell into a deep hole 
 When ProtagonistA looked up , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's fellow ponies staring down at ProtagonistA in disbelief 
 ProtagonistA tried to climb out but the hole was too deep 
 ProtagonistA resigned ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's fate and lay down at the bottom of the hole 
 ProtagonistA started to hallucinate and see things that were n't really there 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's friends and family members come to visit ProtagonistA , but they all turned their backs on ProtagonistA and left ProtagonistA alone 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA died of thirst and was found by ProtagonistA's fellow ponies the next day 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and watched as the grand finale was played out on stage and then on TV 
 As the winner was announced , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a sense of relief 
 It was all over and ProtagonistA could finally relax 
ProtagonistA felt so tired ProtagonistA could n't even tell the day 
 All ProtagonistA knew was that it was dark , and ProtagonistA was cold 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for what felt like hours , but ProtagonistA was n't sure 
 ProtagonistA had been exploring the forest with ProtagonistA's friends when they got separated 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for what felt like hours , but ProtagonistA was n't sure 
 ProtagonistA was getting scared 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA saw a light in the distance 
 ProtagonistA walked towards it , and ProtagonistA saw a house 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door , and ProtagonistB answered 
 ProtagonistA was so tired , ProtagonistA fell asleep as soon as ProtagonistA hit the pillow 
 ProtagonistA was safe now , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistA's way home in the morning 
ProtagonistA , had ProtagonistB ; and , though ProtagonistA was only fifty - one , ProtagonistA was already growing very old indeed 
 ProtagonistA walked with a stoop , and ProtagonistA's hands trembled when ProtagonistA spoke 
 One day , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was going to die soon 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA could feel it in ProtagonistA's bones 
 ProtagonistA died a few weeks later , on ProtagonistA's birthday 
 ProtagonistA had been ProtagonistB's only friend , and now ProtagonistA was gone 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day 
 First , ProtagonistA overslept and was late for work 
 ProtagonistA was so frustrated by the time ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA took it out on ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's room , trying to take a nap , when ProtagonistA heard a loud banging on ProtagonistA's door 
 ProtagonistA groaned , got up , and answered it 
ProtagonistA was what ProtagonistA was -- a kind and caring person who always tried to help others 
 ProtagonistA was always there for ProtagonistA's friends and family , and ProtagonistA was always ready to lend a helping hand 
 Even though ProtagonistA was always helping others , ProtagonistA never asked for anything in return 
 ProtagonistA was content with just being able to help those ProtagonistA cared about 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a princess 
 ProtagonistA loved the idea of being able to wear pretty dresses and have ProtagonistA's own castle 
 But when ProtagonistA finally got ProtagonistA's soul back , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA did n't want to be a princess anymore 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be free 
 So ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's castle and went out into the desert 
 ProtagonistA built ProtagonistA a new home out of sand and stone , and ProtagonistA started to live a new life 
 ProtagonistA did n't need a prince or a castle or anything else 
 ProtagonistA was content in ProtagonistA's new life , and that was all that mattered 
ProtagonistA looked around at the other ponies on the grounds and , after a few moments ' thought , decided that ProtagonistA preferred the company of the solid , rather than anything that flopped like the usual soft little things that other ponies had 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider , preferring the company of horses to ponies , and ProtagonistA felt more comfortable around the solid ponies 
 ProtagonistA was happy just the way ProtagonistA was 
ProtagonistB was a very weird little pony , very little -- but through no fault of ProtagonistA's own did ProtagonistA ever know it 
 ProtagonistA tried to ask ProtagonistB about it , but ProtagonistB just shrugged and said ProtagonistB did n't know what they were talking about 
 But ProtagonistA knew better 
 ProtagonistA could see the difference , even if ProtagonistB could n't 
 And ProtagonistA knew that it was something special 
ProtagonistA was about to rise , and as the last of the sun set , ProtagonistA could be seen over the sea of clouds , ProtagonistA's golden beams dancing in the wind 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful sight , and everyone who saw ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a sense of wonder 
ProtagonistA had been having strange dreams lately 
 ProtagonistA tried to tell ProtagonistA it was nothing , just ProtagonistA's mind playing tricks on ProtagonistA 
 But when ProtagonistA woke up on Saturday morning , ProtagonistA knew something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA could feel it in ProtagonistA's gut 
 ProtagonistA tried to go about ProtagonistA's day as normal , but ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that something was off 
 ProtagonistA could n't focus on anything and ProtagonistA's mind kept wandering 
 By lunchtime , ProtagonistA was certain something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's room and laid down , trying to clear ProtagonistA's head 
 But as soon as ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes , ProtagonistA was back in the dream 
 ProtagonistA was falling , faster and faster 
 ProtagonistA tried to scream , but no sound came out 
 Just as ProtagonistA was about to hit the ground , ProtagonistA woke up 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to tell someone about the dream , but ProtagonistA was scared 
 What if they did n't believe ProtagonistA ? What if they thought ProtagonistA was crazy?In the end , ProtagonistA decided to tell ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could trust ProtagonistB 
 And ProtagonistA was right 
 With the help of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was able to overcome ProtagonistA's fear and get back to sleeping soundly 
ProtagonistA rolled over in a heap of snow that fell around ProtagonistA like a sea of gold in the middle of the night 
 ProtagonistA was cold and ProtagonistA's body ached , but ProtagonistA had to keep moving 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , ever since ProtagonistA had escaped from the castle 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving 
 ProtagonistA had already seen two people die in the cold , their bodies frozen in the snow 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to die , not like that 
 ProtagonistA kept moving , ProtagonistA's feet dragging through the snow 
 ProtagonistA wanted to find a way out of this cold place , but ProtagonistA did n't know where to go 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day 
 Then , ProtagonistA spilled coffee all over ProtagonistA's shirt 
 As ProtagonistA walked home , ProtagonistA tried to keep ProtagonistA's head up and ProtagonistA's spirits high 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could get through this tough day 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistA's best friend , waving and smiling at ProtagonistA from across the street 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's own thin smile sweep across ProtagonistA's gorgeous features 
 Even on ProtagonistA's worst day , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could always count on ProtagonistA's best friend 
ProtagonistA was getting ready for ProtagonistA's date with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA wanted to look perfect 
 ProtagonistA had on a yellow cardigan with a striped T - shirt underneath , a length of dress - length red - blouse and a blouse with a slit at the knee that fell just below the hips , on which ProtagonistA had a pair of high heels 
 ProtagonistA looked in the mirror and was happy with ProtagonistA's outfit 
 ProtagonistA was about to leave when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had forgotten ProtagonistA's purse 
 ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistA's room and got ProtagonistA's purse , then ProtagonistA left 
 When ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistB's house , ProtagonistA was surprised to see that ProtagonistB was dressed similarly to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was at ProtagonistA's greatest splendour when ProtagonistA was crowned Queen of Wonderland 
 ProtagonistA was the most beautiful thing in the world , and everyone loved ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was kind and loving , and always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
ProtagonistA looked up at the sky as if ProtagonistA had n't seen it in a pretty while 
 ProtagonistA sighed and smiled 
ProtagonistA sat down on the edge of a brazier and looked out over the great plain of Pamlicone 
 ProtagonistA could see the huge forest that stretched before ProtagonistA , and the many small villages that were scattered about it 
ProtagonistA barked and hung ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was in for it now 
 ProtagonistA hung ProtagonistA's head in shame and waited for ProtagonistA's fate 
 ProtagonistA was only six years old , but ProtagonistA knew that something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was working on a case that was just too difficult 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB was the best detective in the world , and that ProtagonistB would solve the case 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA believed in ProtagonistB , and that ProtagonistB could do it 
 ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was right - ProtagonistB was the best detective in the world 
ProtagonistA was having a tough day at work 
 ProtagonistA decided to take a break and went to the window to get some fresh air 
 As ProtagonistA looked out , ProtagonistA saw a beautiful stallion in the distance 
 ProtagonistA watched as it gracefully ran through the field and felt ProtagonistA's stress start to melt away 
ProtagonistA had a hobby , one that ProtagonistA thought was amusing 
 ProtagonistA would spend hours upon hours planning and executing pranks on ProtagonistA's unsuspecting friends and family 
 ProtagonistA had planned to put a whoopee cushion on ProtagonistB's chair when ProtagonistB sat down to watch TV , but ProtagonistB caught ProtagonistA in the act and foiled ProtagonistA's plan 
 So , what 's the plan on the diamond market ?  ProtagonistA asked as ProtagonistA gazed out at the street 
  ProtagonistA nodded 
 ProtagonistA was always the patient one 
  ProtagonistA think that 's a good idea ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA think we should wait a few days and see what happens ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA do n't want to make any decisions until we have more information 
ProtagonistA had been thinking about the other day , when ProtagonistA 'd finally realized that ProtagonistA was not what ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA 'd always thought ProtagonistA was a normal girl , but it turns out ProtagonistA was anything but 
 ProtagonistA was actually a magical creature , and ProtagonistA had the power to do things that ProtagonistA never thought possible 
 ProtagonistA was excited to use ProtagonistA's new powers to help others , and ProtagonistA was determined to make the world a better place 
ProtagonistA had been feeling cooped up lately 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being inside all the time and wanted to feel the sun on ProtagonistA's skin 
 ProtagonistA had an idea 
 ProtagonistA would climb to the roof of ProtagonistA's house and jump off , then swim to the small stream that ran through the clearing on the other side of the bank 
 ProtagonistA climbed to the roof and took a deep breath 
 ProtagonistA could do this 
 ProtagonistA was scared but ProtagonistA could do it 
 ProtagonistA jumped 
 ProtagonistA swam to the other side and pulled ProtagonistA out of the water 
 ProtagonistA lay in the sun , feeling the warmth on ProtagonistA's skin and the cool breeze on ProtagonistA's wet clothes 
ProtagonistA had always spoken highly of the Apple family 
 ProtagonistA was content living in their small town , and ProtagonistA did n't see the need to travel 
 But when ProtagonistA's mother became ill , ProtagonistA knew it was time to take the trip 
 ProtagonistA wanted to see ProtagonistA's mother happy one last time 
 So ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and set off for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was sad when the time came to leave , but ProtagonistA was comforted by the knowledge that ProtagonistA would always have a place in ProtagonistA's heart for ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a young filly who loved to run and play 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was out playing with ProtagonistA's friends , ProtagonistA ran a little too hard and fell , hitting ProtagonistA's head on a rock 
ProtagonistA was in a daze as ProtagonistA wandered through the strange land 
 ProtagonistA had only the vague recollection of having visited this place once before , but ProtagonistA could n't remember when or why 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was walking in a dream 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA came upon a small cottage 
 ProtagonistA hesitantly approached the door and knocked 
 ProtagonistA tried the handle , but it was locked 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up and walk away when ProtagonistA heard a voice from inside the cottage 
 ProtagonistA knew that voice 
 ProtagonistA felt a cold chill run down ProtagonistA's spine 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was n't supposed to be here 
 ProtagonistA had to leave before it was too late 
 You're dead ,  ProtagonistA whispered 
  But ProtagonistA 're here too 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA was scared and confused 
  ProtagonistA do n't belong here anymore 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA nodded 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was right 
 ProtagonistA did n't belong in this place 
 As they walked away , ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's memories of this place fading 
 ProtagonistA was still beautiful , but ProtagonistA was no longer my whole world 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked at a blank horizon 
 ProtagonistA felt a sense of dread in ProtagonistA's stomach as ProtagonistA thought about the long journey ahead of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA would never find ProtagonistA's way home 
 ProtagonistA was tired , hungry , and thirsty , but ProtagonistA kept walking 
 ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA stopped , ProtagonistA would never start again 
 ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistA's way home 
 ProtagonistA was just another person in the world to me 
 ProtagonistA was like a superhero 
ProtagonistA thundered down the hall of the Palace , ProtagonistA's hooves pounding against the stone walls 
 ProtagonistA had heard that ProtagonistB was a fair and just ruler , and ProtagonistA wanted to show ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was a worthy successor 
 When ProtagonistA reached the throne room , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on ProtagonistB's throne , surrounded by ProtagonistB's courtiers 
 ProtagonistA bowed low and said ,  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA am Alice , daughter of the Duke of Wonderland 
 ProtagonistA have come to offer ProtagonistA's services to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches , staring up at the stars 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could reach out and touch them 
  ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB standing there 
 Um , hi ,  ProtagonistA said , feeling a bit awkward 
 No , ProtagonistA do n't mind ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA thought for a moment 
  ProtagonistA do n't know ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA guess ProtagonistA have n't really thought about it 
 ProtagonistA considered this 
  Maybe ,  ProtagonistA said 
 Yeah , you too ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA felt a bit more hopeful now , believing that maybe there was someone out there looking back at ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had had a long day 
 First , ProtagonistA had to deal with the courtiers and their never - ending requests 
 Then , ProtagonistA had to meet with ProtagonistA's advisors to discuss the kingdom 's finances 
 After that , ProtagonistA had to attend a banquet in ProtagonistA's honor 
 All ProtagonistA wanted to do now was relax in ProtagonistA's palace by the seaside 
 ProtagonistA lit a match and put it right between the curtains and the headboard 
 ProtagonistA watched as the flames grew , licking at the fabric 
 ProtagonistA sat back and watched as ProtagonistA's palace burned to the ground 
 ProtagonistA felt a sense of relief as ProtagonistA finally allowed ProtagonistA to relax 
When ProtagonistA was younger , Sunflowers used to duck into the garden every chance ProtagonistA 'd get 
 ProtagonistA loved the smell of the flowers and the way the sun would make them look 
 One day , ProtagonistA found a secret garden that no one knew about 
 ProtagonistA spent hours there , admiring the flowers and the way they danced in the breeze 
ProtagonistA had been waiting all morning for the important piece of paperwork that was going to give ProtagonistB ProtagonistB's retroactive pardon 
 ProtagonistA had been working on it for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally going to get to see ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA could hardly sit still 
 ProtagonistA could n't wait to see the look on ProtagonistB's face when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had stood by Carol 's side as ProtagonistA worked at sundown on the last day of the year two thousand and eight 
ProtagonistA was over at the office hours , doing ProtagonistA's best hard - boiled egg - and - coconut dish 
 ProtagonistA had spent hours perfecting the recipe , and it was finally ready 
 ProtagonistA nervously placed the dish in front of ProtagonistB , hoping ProtagonistB would like it 
  This is amazing , ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistA are a fantastic cook 
 ProtagonistA was over the moon 
 ProtagonistA had finally impressed ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's cooking 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would remember ProtagonistA's dish the next time ProtagonistB was looking for a good meal 
ProtagonistA turned around on ProtagonistA's heels and ran to ProtagonistA's bed , the one ProtagonistA's father had made for ProtagonistA and Princess Celestia , to begin the long process of mourning 
 With ProtagonistA's father gone , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost a part of ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be strong for ProtagonistA's sister 
 ProtagonistA had been a captive of the Queen of Hearts for weeks , and ProtagonistA was starting to lose hope 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to be executed soon , and ProtagonistA was determined to take the Queen down with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was going to escape and expose the Queen 's crimes to the world 
 But first , ProtagonistA had to find a way out of ProtagonistA's prison cell 
 ProtagonistA spent hours every day trying to find a way to escape , but so far ProtagonistA had been unsuccessful 
 But ProtagonistA was not going to give up 
 ProtagonistA was going to find a way out , even if it killed ProtagonistA 
One morning , when the sun was bright and the mergansie were jovial , Sunburnt , and the blue - and - white streaked the sky with golden stars and the town of Harmony was bustling with the glee of Times Square , ProtagonistA decided to see ProtagonistB for the first time 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to , but never had the time or money 
 ProtagonistA took a bus to ProtagonistB's house , which was a few hours away 
ProtagonistA was excited to spend the summer with ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA had been looking forward to it for months 
 The day before ProtagonistA was set to leave , ProtagonistA fell off a roof and broke ProtagonistA back 
 ProtagonistA died the next day 
ProtagonistA was herding the ponies to the barn when ProtagonistB approached 
ProtagonistA had called to say that ProtagonistA was pregnant , and no one ever said anything like that anymore 
 ProtagonistA was happy and excited , but ProtagonistA's friends and family just stared at ProtagonistA in disbelief 
 Finally , after years of waiting and hoping , ProtagonistA was going to be a mom 
ProtagonistA had it all -- the perfect job , the perfect friends , and the perfect life 
 But one day , ProtagonistA realized that something was missing 
 ProtagonistA did n't have anyone to share ProtagonistA's life with 
 So , ProtagonistA set out on a journey to find ProtagonistA's soulmate 
 ProtagonistA met a lot of people along the way , but none of them were quite right for ProtagonistA 
 Then , one day , ProtagonistA met a man who was perfect for ProtagonistA in every way 
 And ProtagonistA finally had everything ProtagonistA 'd ever wanted 
ProtagonistA came into the kitchen to find ProtagonistB reading a journal 
 What 's up?Nothing much ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 What 's it about ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 Can ProtagonistA read it ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA sat down at the kitchen table and began to read 
 As ProtagonistA read , ProtagonistA could almost feel as if ProtagonistA was there with ProtagonistC , living ProtagonistC's life alongside ProtagonistC 
 When ProtagonistA finished , ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistB with new respect 
 ProtagonistA smiled 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who loved to explore 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole and decided to follow it 
 ProtagonistA ended up in a strange place called Wonderland 
 Here , ProtagonistA met some interesting characters and had some amazing adventures 
ProtagonistA was just finishing up the last of the cupcakes and had nearly finished ProtagonistA's breakfast when ProtagonistA heard the door open 
 ProtagonistA knew it was ProtagonistB coming home from ProtagonistB's early morning walk 
 ProtagonistA went to greet ProtagonistB with a cupcake in hand 
  ProtagonistA 're up early 
  ProtagonistA made ProtagonistB a cupcake 
ProtagonistA was in a panic 
 ProtagonistA was in a strange room and ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA got there 
 ProtagonistA looked around the room , trying to find a way out 
 ProtagonistA did n't see a door anywhere 
 ProtagonistA started to feel panicky and claustrophobic 
 ProtagonistA looked around the room again , desperately searching for a way out 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA saw a door in the far corner of the room 
 ProtagonistA ran to it and tried to open it , but it was locked 
 ProtagonistA started to feel frantic 
 ProtagonistA looked around the room one last time and then ProtagonistA saw a key on the mantelpiece 
 ProtagonistA grabbed it and tried it in the door 
 ProtagonistA had been a single mother for six years , and had done quite well for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was starting to feel lonely 
 ProtagonistA had thought about going back to ProtagonistA's family home , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if they would accept ProtagonistA back , or if they would even want ProtagonistA's daughter there 
 ProtagonistA had also thought about marrying a man , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA was ready for that either 
 As ProtagonistA was walking and thinking , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA stopped and stared at ProtagonistB for a moment , and then ProtagonistA smiled 
 ProtagonistA knew then that ProtagonistA was ready to marry ProtagonistB , and that ProtagonistA would never be alone again 
 ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB how to use ProtagonistA's powers to make the earth freeze and then showed ProtagonistB how to use ProtagonistA's powers to make it thaw 
ProtagonistA was on trial for murder 
 ProtagonistA had killed ProtagonistB after ProtagonistB had cheated on ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's best friend 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistC that ProtagonistA had come home and found ProtagonistB in bed with ProtagonistA's best friend 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had gone into the kitchen and grabbed a knife 
 ProtagonistA then went back into the bedroom and stabbed ProtagonistB to death 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistD that ProtagonistA had found a recipe for a poisonous cake on ProtagonistB's computer 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had baked the cake and put it on ProtagonistB's nightstand 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would eat it and that it would kill ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA looked around and noticed that ProtagonistA had disappeared 
 ProtagonistA was in a white room with no doors or windows 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA got there or how to get out 
 ProtagonistA started to panic when ProtagonistA heard a voice 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked at a blank horizon 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , ever since ProtagonistA had been forced to leave ProtagonistA's home 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , or what ProtagonistA would find when ProtagonistA got there 
 All ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistA had to keep moving 
 ProtagonistA had been rationing ProtagonistA's water , but ProtagonistA was almost out 
 ProtagonistA was about to get up and keep walking when ProtagonistA heard a sound in the distance 
 ProtagonistA quickly hid behind a nearby bush and waited 
 ProtagonistA could hear the sound of footsteps getting closer and closer 
 ProtagonistA was about to call out to ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA saw the look on ProtagonistB's face 
 ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistB was being chased by someone 
 ProtagonistA waited until ProtagonistB was closer , and then ProtagonistA jumped out and grabbed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA pulled ProtagonistB behind the bush and waited 
 Soon , ProtagonistA could hear the sound of someone else coming 
 ProtagonistA peeked out from behind the bush and saw two men 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do something 
 ProtagonistA jumped out from behind the bush and yelled at the men to stop 
 ProtagonistA used that moment to ProtagonistA's advantage 
 ProtagonistA ran towards the men and tackled one of them to the ground 
 ProtagonistA knocked the gun out of ProtagonistC's hand and punched ProtagonistC in the face 
 ProtagonistA grabbed ProtagonistB and started to run 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get away from those men 
ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistA's eyes peeled for anything out of the ordinary , but ProtagonistA was doing ProtagonistA best to ignore the odd look the look of interest was giving ProtagonistA 
 It was clear that ProtagonistB was interested in ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA was interested in ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to give ProtagonistB the wrong impression , so ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to avoid eye contact 
ProtagonistA stood up and trotted across the grass , trotted down a short flight of steps and to the door of the cottage ProtagonistA had recently moved into 
 ProtagonistA pushed the door open a bit further and peeked inside 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , so ProtagonistA just stood there and watched 
 ProtagonistA felt bad for ProtagonistB , so ProtagonistA walked into the cottage and went over to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA helped ProtagonistB up and sat ProtagonistB down in a chair 
 ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistB's name was Sarah , and ProtagonistB had just moved into the cottage too 
 ProtagonistA comforted ProtagonistB and told ProtagonistB that everything would be alright 
 ProtagonistA went home , thinking about what had happened 
 ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had been there to help ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA vowed to always be a good friend to ProtagonistB 
 So , when ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA standing upright before Alice 's book - tables in the late afternoon , ProtagonistA looked around the vast space with the air of a man who had been long since back in England 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA was not welcome here 
 But ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA had been planning this moment for years 
 And now , finally , ProtagonistA was going to get ProtagonistA's revenge 
ProtagonistA had been going through a bad patch of writing for a few weeks now , but if the last few months had gone by ProtagonistA had not long since come to the realisation that the final word on ProtagonistA's work was not always the most important 
 ProtagonistA had been through ups and downs with ProtagonistA writing before , and ProtagonistA knew that this too shall pass 
 ProtagonistA just had to keep plugging away and eventually the words would come 
ProtagonistA stood up and trotted through the gardens , running up the side of a hill and across the grass , until ProtagonistA reached the top of a bluff above the water 's surface 
 There , ProtagonistA found a small boat waiting for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA climbed in and rowed out to the center of the lake , where ProtagonistA let the boat drift and watched the sun set 
ProtagonistA got home and found that ProtagonistA's house was cold and dark 
 ProtagonistA tried to ignore the dog and went to the castle to see what was going on 
ProtagonistA stood on ProtagonistA's rock and stared into the water 
 ProtagonistA could see the fish swimming around 
 ProtagonistA could see the plants moving in the water 
 ProtagonistA could even see the rocks on the bottom 
 ProtagonistA was so fascinated by what ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistA's mom calling ProtagonistA for dinner 
ProtagonistA was having a hard time deciding whether to take ProtagonistA's first trip home or not 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to travel , but ProtagonistA was also very attached to ProtagonistA's home and ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA thought about all of the amazing places ProtagonistA could see and the new people ProtagonistA could meet , but ProtagonistA also thought about how much ProtagonistA would miss ProtagonistA's loved ones at home 
 In the end , ProtagonistA decided to take the trip and ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA had an incredible time and ProtagonistA was able to see so many new things , but ProtagonistA was also happy to be home at the end of it all 
ProtagonistA is my best friend 
 And ProtagonistA really likes me , but that does n't bother ProtagonistA much anymore 
 ProtagonistA was there for me from the very beginning 
 ProtagonistA was my first friend and ProtagonistA 's been by my side ever since 
 Even though ProtagonistA does n't remember it , ProtagonistA was there the day I was born 
 ProtagonistA was the one who found me in the forest and brought me back to the castle 
ProtagonistA had been married to ProtagonistC for several weeks when ProtagonistA heard that ProtagonistB was expecting a baby 
 ProtagonistA was overjoyed for ProtagonistB and could n't wait to meet the new addition to the family 
 However , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little jealous 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC had been trying to conceive for a while now without any luck 
 ProtagonistA knew that it was n't ProtagonistB's fault , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel envious 
 Still , ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB and was excited to be an aunt 
 ProtagonistA was determined to help ProtagonistB in any way ProtagonistA could , and ProtagonistA knew that the baby would bring them all even closer together 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day 
 First , ProtagonistA woke up late and had to rush to get ready for ProtagonistA's day 
 Then , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had forgotten to do ProtagonistA's homework the night before 
 When ProtagonistA got to school , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's lunch at home 
 ProtagonistA was feeling really down by the time lunch period came around 
 ProtagonistA sat down on the ground , ProtagonistA's tail turning to one side and ProtagonistA's eyes closed , and tried to forget about ProtagonistA's troubles 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt something soft and warm nudge ProtagonistA's arm 
 ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes to see ProtagonistB sitting next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was grateful to ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's support and friendship 
 ProtagonistA knew that no matter what , ProtagonistB would always be there for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA should n't have been playing with the gun , but it was so tempting 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's saddle and looked around the sea , sliding ProtagonistA's hooves gently through the pegasus 's smooth underbelly 
 ProtagonistA felt at peace , and ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes , letting the wind blow through ProtagonistA's hair 
  It was clear that ProtagonistA was not enjoying the book , but ProtagonistA was determined to finish it 
 ProtagonistA had started it weeks ago , and it was now the only thing ProtagonistA had left to read 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping for a good , heart - wrenching story , but instead ProtagonistA got a book that was full of fluff 
 ProtagonistA was about halfway through , and ProtagonistA was starting to lose hope that the story would get any better 
 Still , ProtagonistA persisted 
 ProtagonistA had come this far , and ProtagonistA was not going to give up now 
 Maybe the ending would be worth it , ProtagonistA thought 
 ProtagonistA threw the book across the room , and it hit the wall with a thud 
 From now on , ProtagonistA was only going to read books that were actually worth ProtagonistA's time 
 ProtagonistA had been running for what felt like hours , ever since ProtagonistA had seen the fire in the distance 
 Now , ProtagonistA was close enough to see the flames licking at the sky , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA had no idea where they were , but ProtagonistA knew they would be looking for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had to find them before the fire did 
 ProtagonistA started to run again , ProtagonistA's hooves pounding the ground as ProtagonistA went 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA ran faster , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
 ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistA's family before the fire consumed them 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA would do if ProtagonistA lost them 
 ProtagonistA ran faster , ProtagonistA's lungs burning with the effort 
 ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistA's family before it was too late 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA saw them 
 ProtagonistA ran to them , and they gathered around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was safe now 
 ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's family 
The first time we met ProtagonistA , in a dream , ProtagonistA had gone there alone 
 ProtagonistA was scared at first , but then ProtagonistA saw us 
 ProtagonistA was amazed and delighted by everything ProtagonistA saw 
ProtagonistA watched the sunset from the window of ProtagonistA's room at the end of the house 
 In the mirror , ProtagonistA could see the sun setting behind the trees 
 ProtagonistA felt a warmth in ProtagonistA's heart as ProtagonistA watched the sun set 
 ProtagonistA was grateful for the beautiful moment 
ProtagonistA had never imagined that ProtagonistA would be one of the subject matter of such a search , but even now it seemed that ProtagonistA was holding onto something which perhaps ProtagonistA was n't entirely comfortable with 
 ProtagonistA knew that what ProtagonistA was doing was wrong , but ProtagonistA could n't help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was addicted to the thrill of the chase , and the feeling of power that came with it 
 Even now , as ProtagonistA sat in the interrogation room , ProtagonistA felt a sense of excitement 
 This was it , ProtagonistA was finally going to be caught 
 But even as the police officers read out ProtagonistA's list of crimes , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a sense of pride 
 ProtagonistA had outsmarted them for so long , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to get ProtagonistA's comeuppance 
 But as ProtagonistA was led away to ProtagonistA's cell , ProtagonistA could n't help but wonder if this was really the end 
 After all , ProtagonistA had always been a survivor 
It 's all right , ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA said so sweetly , that ProtagonistA's hooves shook the paper as ProtagonistA said it 
 ProtagonistB was so scared when ProtagonistB saw the big , mean dog , but ProtagonistA was there to protect ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 's always there for ProtagonistB , just like ProtagonistB's mom 
ProtagonistA , was sitting in ProtagonistA's room looking at the stars 
 ProtagonistA had a thought that in a country that had been ProtagonistA's own for so long , very little would be left to ProtagonistA if anything happened 
 ProtagonistA would have no one to protect ProtagonistA 
One morning ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's doubts again 
 ProtagonistA was unsure if ProtagonistA wanted to go to ProtagonistA's job or if ProtagonistA wanted to quit and find something new 
 ProtagonistA thought about all of the things ProtagonistA did n't like about ProtagonistA's job and how ProtagonistA felt so unfulfilled 
 ProtagonistA thought about how ProtagonistA was always so tired and how ProtagonistA never had any time for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA thought about how ProtagonistA was always stressed and how ProtagonistA never felt like ProtagonistA was doing anything that mattered 
 As ProtagonistA thought about all of these things , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been putting off making a decision for far too long 
 ProtagonistA knew that whatever ProtagonistA decided , it would be a big change 
 But ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA was ready for a change 
ProtagonistA was back at the bank , shuffling ProtagonistA's feet as ProtagonistA waited with bated breath for the check to come in 
 ProtagonistA had been waiting for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had been laid off from ProtagonistA's job 
 ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief as ProtagonistA deposited it into ProtagonistA's account 
 With the money , ProtagonistA would be able to pay ProtagonistA's rent and buy food 
 ProtagonistA was grateful for the help , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit humiliated 
 ProtagonistA had never thought ProtagonistA would be in this position 
ProtagonistA looked around , minding ProtagonistA's own business , when ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA face to face with a sniping unicorn 
 ProtagonistA was so startled that ProtagonistA jumped back and hit ProtagonistA's head on a tree 
 When ProtagonistA came to , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a strange place 
 ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's feet and began to walk , not knowing where ProtagonistA was or how ProtagonistA would get home 
 After a while , ProtagonistA came to a clearing and in the center was a beautiful castle 
 ProtagonistA walked up to it and knocked on the door 
 When no one answered , ProtagonistA walked in 
 ProtagonistA explore the castle and eventually came to a room that was filled with treasure 
 ProtagonistA also found a door that led outside 
 ProtagonistA went back to the room with the treasure and began to fill ProtagonistA's pockets with as much as ProtagonistA could carry 
 ProtagonistA then went back outside and began the long walk home 
ProtagonistA lifted ProtagonistA's head , and peered out over the horizon 
 ProtagonistA could see the sun just beginning to peek over the edge , and the sky was a beautiful orange 
 ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and calm wash over ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and took a deep breath 
ProtagonistA has been slowly moping ProtagonistA's hooves through the blizzard of paperwork that is the letter from the Apple family 
 ProtagonistA knew that they were going to be upset , but ProtagonistA did n't expect them to be this upset 
 ProtagonistA has been getting more and more letters from them lately , and each one is more angry than the last 
 ProtagonistA does n't know what ProtagonistA did to deserve this , but ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA needs to find a way to make it stop 
ProtagonistA sat by ProtagonistA's friends , watching them , and looking around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt so alone , even though ProtagonistA was surrounded by people 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to connect with them , and ProtagonistA did n't know how to make friends 
 ProtagonistA just sat there , watching them , and feeling left out 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's bedroom , writing a letter to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was telling ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's day and how ProtagonistA had made a new friend at school 
 ProtagonistA was excited to tell ProtagonistB all about ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA hoped that ProtagonistB would be able to come and visit soon 
ProtagonistA thrashed about on all fours , helping ProtagonistA's hooves through the dusty soil like a frightened child 
 ProtagonistA had never felt so scared in ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA had been out in the pasture all day , and now , it was getting dark 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should go back to the barn , but ProtagonistA was afraid of what might happen if ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA had seen the other horses go in there , and they never came out 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to end up like them 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise that made ProtagonistA's heart race 
 ProtagonistA tried to run , but ProtagonistA's hooves would n't move 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and waited for whatever was coming for ProtagonistA 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt something warm and soft touch ProtagonistA's nose 
 ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes to see a horse standing in front of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's fear melting away 
 ProtagonistA stood up and followed the horse back to the barn 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was safe now 
ProtagonistA had been meaning to write to ProtagonistB for a long time , but ProtagonistA was beginning to get tired of waiting 
 ProtagonistA had so much to say to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB dearly 
 Finally , ProtagonistA decided to take matters into ProtagonistA's own hands and write the letter ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA hope this letter finds ProtagonistB well 
 ProtagonistA miss ProtagonistB a lot , and ProtagonistA hope we can catch up soon 
 ProtagonistA was very lonely and felt like ProtagonistA had lost everything 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was finally able to have the wedding ProtagonistA always wanted , and ProtagonistA was very happy 
 ProtagonistA had nowhere to go and no one to turn to 
 Even though the fire had destroyed everything ProtagonistA had , ProtagonistA was still standing 
 ProtagonistA was a survivor 
ProtagonistA was walking home from ProtagonistA's friend 's house late one night when ProtagonistA noticed the moon glittered behind ProtagonistA , like a crystal ball of light 
 ProtagonistA stopped and stared at it for a moment , mesmerized by its beauty 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise behind ProtagonistA and turned around to see a large , black cat walking towards ProtagonistA 
 Then ProtagonistA regained ProtagonistA's composure and replied ,  Yes , it is 
 ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA could n't move 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked down at a firm blank horizon 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , ever since ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's home in the forest 
 ProtagonistA was tired , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore , but ProtagonistA kept walking 
 ProtagonistA was looking for something , though ProtagonistA did n't know what it was 
 ProtagonistA just knew ProtagonistA needed to find it 
 As ProtagonistA sat there , ProtagonistA saw a small dot on the horizon 
 As it got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was a raven 
  ProtagonistA 're looking for something , ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA wo n't find it out there 
 ProtagonistA need to go home 
 ProtagonistA thought about what the raven had said 
 ProtagonistA was tired and sore , and ProtagonistA was n't going to find whatever it was ProtagonistA was looking for out there 
 ProtagonistA thanked the raven , and turned around to head back home 
ProtagonistA had just gotten off work when ProtagonistA was kidnapped by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB breathing heavily in the darkness 
 ProtagonistA tried to scream , but ProtagonistB covered ProtagonistA's mouth with ProtagonistB's hand 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistB was going to do to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was beginning to feel like ProtagonistA was the only one it ever had contact with 
 ProtagonistA was its only friend 
 One day , ProtagonistA came into the room and the beast was gone 
 ProtagonistA felt a pang of sadness , but also relief 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to care for it and was afraid of it 
 Now ProtagonistA could go back to ProtagonistA's normal life 
ProtagonistA was up early as usual , trying to get a head start on ProtagonistA's day 
 ProtagonistA had a lot of errands to run and did n't want to waste any time 
 As ProtagonistA was walking through town , ProtagonistA saw the Ponyville library and decided to stop in 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should n't , but ProtagonistA could n't help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA walked in and started looking for ProtagonistA's favorite book 
 ProtagonistA did n't see it anywhere and was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw it on the top shelf 
 ProtagonistA reached for it , but it was just out of ProtagonistA's reach 
 ProtagonistA looked around to see if anyone was watching and then boosted ProtagonistA up onto the shelf 
 ProtagonistA grabbed the book and then quickly climbed down 
 ProtagonistA put the book back in its place and then hurried out of the library 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be more careful in the future or ProtagonistA would get caught 
ProtagonistA hoped that they would be okay 
 At least ProtagonistA said so as ProtagonistA rested ProtagonistA's hoof on the end of ProtagonistB's hoof 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was worried and ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to try and comfort ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that it was n't easy to be in ProtagonistB's position 
 But ProtagonistA was there for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA would support ProtagonistB no matter what happened 
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA came across a horse 
 The horse then shook its hoof and ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head again 
  ProtagonistA 'm not shaking ProtagonistA's head ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA could replay memories like they were movies , and ProtagonistA could even make up ProtagonistA's own stories 
 Sometimes , ProtagonistA would imagine ProtagonistA as a character in a book , and ProtagonistA would live out the adventure in ProtagonistA's mind 
 Other times , ProtagonistA would be a musician , playing to a crowd of adoring fans 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA knew everything , and yet there was much ProtagonistA knew nothing about 
 ProtagonistA was always the top of ProtagonistA's class , the teacher 's favorite , and ProtagonistA had never been challenged 
 Over time , ProtagonistA learned more and more from ProtagonistB and realized that there was a whole world of knowledge out there that ProtagonistA had never even imagined 
 ProtagonistA was no longer the smartest person in the room , but ProtagonistA was okay with that because ProtagonistA was learning so much 
ProtagonistA had been out all day , exploring the kingdom with ProtagonistA's mer - dog in tow 
 ProtagonistA was getting tired , and the sun was beginning to set 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to head home soon 
 As ProtagonistA was walking , ProtagonistA heard a faint noise in the distance 
 ProtagonistA followed the sound until ProtagonistA came to a clearing in the forest 
 There , ProtagonistA saw a group of animals playing music 
 They were all so good ! ProtagonistA sat down and listened to them play 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA got too tired and had to go home 
 But ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA had found the music - makers in the forest 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would always remember this magical moment 
ProtagonistA sat down on the edge of the bank , crossed ProtagonistA's legs , and stared out into the sea 
 ProtagonistA had always loved the ocean , even though ProtagonistA had never been able to swim in it 
 ProtagonistA loved the way it looked like a never - ending abyss , and the way the waves crashed against the shore 
 ProtagonistA sat there for a while , just letting ProtagonistA's mind wander 
 ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's life and how it had been so different from what ProtagonistA had expected 
 ProtagonistA had always thought ProtagonistA would be married with kids by now , but it just had n't happened 
 ProtagonistA was n't even close to finding the right person 
 ProtagonistA sighed and shook ProtagonistA's head , trying to push those thoughts out of ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA looked back out at the ocean and saw a dolphin jump out of the water 
 ProtagonistA smiled and watched it for a while before standing up and dusting off ProtagonistA's pants 
 ProtagonistA was feeling a little better now , and ProtagonistA decided to go for a walk 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's rock and blinked ProtagonistA's eyes , wondering how to get back to reality 
 ProtagonistA had been in this strange place for what felt like days , and ProtagonistA was starting to get worried 
 ProtagonistA had tried everything ProtagonistA could think of to get back home , but nothing had worked 
 ProtagonistA was just about to give up when ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistB seemed to know ProtagonistA 
 Where are we ? What is this place ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA was still confused , but ProtagonistA was also starting to feel hopeful 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's hand and followed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had nothing to lose at this point 
 ProtagonistA hesitated again , but then ProtagonistA took a deep breath and stepped through 
 When ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA back in ProtagonistA's own bedroom 
 ProtagonistA blinked ProtagonistA's eyes , wondering if it was all just a dream 
 But then ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing next to ProtagonistA , looking just as surprised as ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA was really back in reality 
 Thank ProtagonistB so much for finding ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA 're the one who found the way out 
ProtagonistA was quietly trying to get to ProtagonistA's feet when ProtagonistA heard a sharp screech 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw a large bird flying towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA tried to run away , but the bird was too fast 
 ProtagonistA screamed for help , but no one was around to hear ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was surrounded by bones 
 ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA sat down and cried 
ProtagonistA stood at the edge of the rocky pinnacle , ProtagonistA's hooves glinting in the morning sunlight 
 ProtagonistA looked out over the vast kingdom below ProtagonistA and sighed 
 ProtagonistA had ruled for centuries , and seen many changes come to ProtagonistA's kingdom 
ProtagonistA was out for a ride on ProtagonistA's black mare when ProtagonistA suddenly felt a fierce thirst 
 As ProtagonistA watched the mare drink , ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's own thirst begin to grow 
 ProtagonistA knelt down and scooped up a handful of water , then drank deeply 
 As ProtagonistA sat there , ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's body begin to relax and ProtagonistA's mind begin to clear 
 ProtagonistA sat there for a long time , just watching the mare drink and feeling the peace of the moment 
ProtagonistA had been living in the fort for a few months now , and ProtagonistA loved it 
 ProtagonistA was always on the go , and ProtagonistA never had time to just sit and relax 
 But here , ProtagonistA could do whatever ProtagonistA wanted 
 ProtagonistA could sit in the dining room and enjoy ProtagonistA's meal , or ProtagonistA could go for a walk around the grounds 
 Tonight , ProtagonistA had decided to stay in and have a quiet dinner 
 ProtagonistA slipped into the dining room and sat down at the table 
 ProtagonistA looked around the room , taking in the white walls and the low table 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could just sit and relax forever 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise outside 
 ProtagonistA got up from the table and went to the window to see who it was 
 ProtagonistA waved to them , and they waved back 
 Then ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistA's dinner 
 ProtagonistA was just about to take a bite of ProtagonistA's food when ProtagonistA heard the noise again 
 ProtagonistA got up and ran to the door 
 ProtagonistA opened it just in time to see a man trying to break in 
 ProtagonistA screamed , and the man ran away 
 ProtagonistA went back to the dining room and finished ProtagonistA's dinner 
 ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had decided to stay in tonight 
 It was definitely a night ProtagonistA would never forget 
 ProtagonistA was content to sit and listen to the natural sounds of the world around ProtagonistA , letting ProtagonistA's mind wander 
 ProtagonistA even thought of the plants , how they must be basking in the warm sunlight 
  It 's a picture of ProtagonistA's family ,  ProtagonistA replied 
   ProtagonistB can , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA took a deep breath , then ProtagonistA's horn : the thrall of ambition 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a professional musician , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to make ProtagonistA's dream a reality 
 ProtagonistA had been practicing for years , and ProtagonistA was confident in ProtagonistA's abilities 
 ProtagonistA was going to make it , no matter what 
 The audition was for a spot in the symphony orchestra , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was up against some stiff competition 
 But ProtagonistA was determined to give it ProtagonistA all 
 ProtagonistA played ProtagonistA's piece flawlessly , and when ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had nailed it 
 Now ProtagonistA just had to wait for the results 
 ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA would get the job , but ProtagonistA did n't want to get ProtagonistA hopes up too much 
 ProtagonistA would just have to wait and see 
The day ProtagonistB first met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was four and a half years old 
 ProtagonistA was a little girl with blonde hair and blue eyes 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a pink dress and ProtagonistA had a doll in ProtagonistA's hand 
 ProtagonistA was the most beautiful thing ProtagonistB had ever seen 
 What 's ProtagonistA's name ?  ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's big blue eyes and said ,  ProtagonistA's name is Alice 
 Do ProtagonistA want to be friends ?  ProtagonistA nodded ProtagonistA's head and held out ProtagonistA's hand 
 ProtagonistA were friends from that day forward 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was brushing ProtagonistB's hair as the sun rose over the sky 
 ProtagonistA smiled as ProtagonistA worked , thinking of the days when ProtagonistA would go for rides with ProtagonistA's father on his horse 
 Now , ProtagonistA was a grown woman with responsibilities 
 But ProtagonistA still loved spending time with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had been living in the land for many years , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB had been a force in its history 
 ProtagonistA remembered the stories that ProtagonistB had told ProtagonistA about the land and its people 
 ProtagonistA also remembered the times when ProtagonistB had helped ProtagonistA to understand the land and its ways 
 Even though ProtagonistB had passed away a few years before , ProtagonistA had not forgotten ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had gone out for a walk and gotten lost 
 Finally , ProtagonistA showed up 
 ProtagonistA was tired and dirty , but ProtagonistA was safe 
ProtagonistA was the daughter of a statistician in Champlain 
 ProtagonistA managed to get four years of education and learn some useful skills 
 When ProtagonistA was older , ProtagonistA became a carpenter , hatter , and office seeker 
 ProtagonistA was very successful in ProtagonistA's work and helped many people 
ProtagonistA stood on ProtagonistA's hind legs , took a long breath , and then let out a loud , long howl 
 ProtagonistA had been feeling cooped up lately and needed to let off some steam 
 Now , with the wind in ProtagonistA's fur and the sun on ProtagonistA's face , ProtagonistA felt alive 
 ProtagonistA ran and played until ProtagonistA was exhausted , then flopped down on the grass , panting and happy 
ProtagonistA gave a hoof and ProtagonistA's ears , a slight twitching 
 ProtagonistA had been in this place for far too long and ProtagonistA was starting to get antsy 
 ProtagonistA had been here since ProtagonistA was a filly and it was time to move on 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what was out there , but ProtagonistA was sure that it was better than this 
 ProtagonistA had never even seen the outside 
 ProtagonistA had heard stories from the other horses , but ProtagonistA did n't really believe them 
 But ProtagonistA was going to find out for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA started to walk towards the door and the other horses started to whinny and stamp their feet 
 ProtagonistA was the first one to ever leave 
 ProtagonistA walked out the door and into the sunlight 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA started to gallop and ProtagonistA felt free for the first time in ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA had always known that ProtagonistA had a lot of talent 
 ProtagonistA had always been good at art and music , and ProtagonistA was always able to make friends easily 
 But ProtagonistA never realized how much talent ProtagonistA really had until ProtagonistA went to college 
 ProtagonistA was studying art history , and ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA was better at it than most of ProtagonistA's classmates 
 ProtagonistA started getting good grades and was even asked to give a few lectures 
 ProtagonistA was surprised at how much talent ProtagonistA had 
 ProtagonistA always thought ProtagonistA was just average , but it turns out ProtagonistA was actually quite gifted 
 ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA finally found ProtagonistA's niche and was able to excel in something ProtagonistA loved 
ProtagonistA pranced through the air , bouncing on ProtagonistA's wings , ProtagonistA's hooves floating in the swirling air 
 ProtagonistA felt weightless and free , like ProtagonistA could fly forever 
 ProtagonistA laughed and somersaulted in the air , enjoying the sensation of the wind rushing through ProtagonistA's fur 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a loud boom and felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's side 
 ProtagonistA looked down and saw an arrow protruding from ProtagonistA's body 
 ProtagonistA tried to fly away , but ProtagonistA's wings would no longer move 
 ProtagonistA plummeted to the ground , the arrow still embedded in ProtagonistA's side 
 As ProtagonistA lay there , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt the life draining out of ProtagonistA's body as ProtagonistA lay there , helpless 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could have flown away and escaped ProtagonistA's fate , but it was too late 
ProtagonistA was out for a ride on ProtagonistA's horse , enjoying the sunny day 
 ProtagonistA stopped to rest for a bit , and watched the sunset 
 ProtagonistA sat there for a while , just taking it all in 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about the events of the past few days and how everything had changed so quickly 
 But now , ProtagonistA was on the run from the law , and ProtagonistA had no idea what the future held 
 ProtagonistA was tired , and ProtagonistA just wanted to rest , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving 
 ProtagonistA had to find a way to clear ProtagonistA's name and find out who was really behind all of this 
 As ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistA's cabin , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing in the shadows 
 ProtagonistA tensed up , but ProtagonistA did n't make a sound 
  ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB 've been looking for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA sat and watched the rain , knowing ProtagonistA's friends would be there to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been through so much lately and ProtagonistA was exhausted 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't keep going on like this , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to ask for help 
 ProtagonistA sat there for a long time , just watching the rain 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a dreamer 
 ProtagonistA was always off on some new adventure , never content to stay in one place for very long 
 Alice , my dear , we 're going to live in a storybook !  ProtagonistA exclaimed 
 ProtagonistB was sure ProtagonistA must be joking , but it was soon clear that ProtagonistA was serious 
 ProtagonistA had found an old house in the woods that was said to be the home of ProtagonistC 
 After all , it 's just a story ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's rock and stared into the water 
 ProtagonistA could see the fish swimming around and the plants moving in the current 
 ProtagonistA sat there for hours , just watching the water 
ProtagonistA was about to take ProtagonistA's maidenhead to court 
 ProtagonistA was a bit nervous , but ProtagonistA was also excited 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to experience what it was like to be with a man , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to get ProtagonistA's chance 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would enjoy it immensely 
 ProtagonistA was a very curious girl 
 ProtagonistA loved to explore and learn new things 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole 
 ProtagonistA followed the rabbit down the hole and found ProtagonistA in a strange place 
 ProtagonistA met many interesting creatures there and had many adventures 
ProtagonistA sat on the bank , hunting for ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA had seen them go into the woods , but ProtagonistA could n't find them anywhere 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up and go home when ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes 
 ProtagonistA got up and followed the noise 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day 
 First , ProtagonistA got a bad grade on ProtagonistA's math test 
 To top it all off , ProtagonistA found out ProtagonistC had been hit by a car 
 ProtagonistA was so upset , ProtagonistA threw down ProtagonistA's chair and leaned forward in the air 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA's whole world was falling apart 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice 
 ProtagonistA snapped into action and took ProtagonistC to the vet 
 ProtagonistA felt relieved 
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA saw the moon shining between the trees 
 ProtagonistA thought it was beautiful and decided to take a picture 
 When ProtagonistA looked at the picture later , ProtagonistA was surprised to see that the moon was not in the photo 
 ProtagonistA looked back up at the sky and saw that the moon had disappeared 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible time remembering what ProtagonistA had done that morning 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had gotten out of bed and eaten breakfast , but after that , ProtagonistA's mind was a total blank 
 ProtagonistA racked ProtagonistA's brain , trying to think of anything that could help ProtagonistA remember , but it was all for naught 
 Finally , ProtagonistA gave up and decided to ask ProtagonistB , if ProtagonistB could help 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA suddenly remembered something 
 Oh , that 's right ! ProtagonistA went to the store this morning 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's help and went on with ProtagonistA's day 
ProtagonistA was a fox - woman of the valley , and in those days the fox - men of the valley fought evil as well as good 
 Even in the darkest hours of the war , when the survival of ProtagonistA's race depended on ProtagonistA keeping a close watch on ProtagonistA's allies and ProtagonistA's sons , ProtagonistA never wavered 
 ProtagonistA was a fierce fighter and a loyal friend , and ProtagonistA would do whatever it took to protect ProtagonistA's people 
 ProtagonistA was bleeding heavily and ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistA's life slipping away 
 As ProtagonistA lay there on the battlefield , ProtagonistA saw a beautiful light shining down on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA rose to ProtagonistA's feet and fought with renewed vigor 
 ProtagonistA was like a force of nature , and ProtagonistA quickly turned the tide of the battle 
 ProtagonistA was a hero , and ProtagonistA would always be remembered as such 
 However , ProtagonistA quickly rose in the ranks , due to ProtagonistA's great magical abilities 
 ProtagonistA became a key figure in the kingdom , stabilizing it and making it far more prosperous 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends were fighting as best they could , but they were quickly being overwhelmed 
 Just when it looked like they were about to be defeated , ProtagonistA summoned a powerful magical blast that took out all of the bandits 
 ProtagonistA continued to use ProtagonistA's magic to help ProtagonistA's kingdom , and ProtagonistA soon became one of the most powerful and respected leaders in all of Equestria 
ProtagonistA is sitting with ProtagonistA's wings folded , legs crossed at the navel 
 ProtagonistA is at peace with ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's choices 
 ProtagonistA has no regrets 
 ProtagonistA looks up at the sky and sees the beauty of the world around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA is content 
ProtagonistA had been searching through the hospital wing for hours , looking for the right book 
 ProtagonistA was exhausted , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to find it 
 ProtagonistA quickly made ProtagonistA's way to the small circular room that was ProtagonistA's office and began the day with an appointment 
ProtagonistA stood at the edge of the cliff , ProtagonistA's head down and eyes wide , looking out into the ocean beyond 
 ProtagonistA had always loved the ocean , but this was the first time ProtagonistA had ever been so close to it 
 ProtagonistA was about to take a step forward when ProtagonistA heard a voice behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to see the ocean ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA did n't mean to scare you 
 ProtagonistA realized then how foolish ProtagonistA had been 
 ProtagonistA was lucky ProtagonistA's mother had been there to stop ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA nodded and followed ProtagonistA's mother back to the car 
 ProtagonistA was quiet the whole way home , and ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistA ProtagonistA would never do anything so reckless again 
 ProtagonistA was the first person I ever met who truly understood me , and I will never forget ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA leaned ProtagonistA's head back against the window and peered into the sea below 
 ProtagonistA could see the fish swimming in the water and the coral reefs 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could go swimming in the sea , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't 
 ProtagonistA was on a ship , and it was taking ProtagonistA to a new place 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA was excited to find out 
ProtagonistA turned at the last minute to see ProtagonistB sitting on the bank watching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA waved , but ProtagonistB just sat there 
 ProtagonistA turned back to the river and continued to paddle ProtagonistA's canoe 
 ProtagonistA had been paddling for hours and was getting tired 
 ProtagonistA looked back at ProtagonistB again , but this time ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistA sighed and paddled on 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the shade of a tree , looking up from the book lying on ProtagonistA's lap 
 ProtagonistA saw a rabbit running by and followed it with ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA got up and walked over to the door , wondering if ProtagonistA should go in 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's saddled legs and stared down at ProtagonistA's hooves , wondering what the terror of the demon spell cast down on the citizens should have been like 
 It had been a long time since ProtagonistA had been able to use ProtagonistA's magic , and ProtagonistA was itching to try it out again 
 ProtagonistA had been practicing in secret , but ProtagonistA was still not sure if ProtagonistA was ready to face the demon again 
 ProtagonistA had to find a way to break the spell and save the people from the demon 's wrath 
 ProtagonistA loved the feel of the water on ProtagonistA's skin , the way it made ProtagonistA feel weightless and free 
 One night , ProtagonistA snuck out of ProtagonistA's bedroom window and made ProtagonistA's way to the pool 
 ProtagonistA dove in , and the cool water was a shock to ProtagonistA's system 
 When ProtagonistA finally got out , ProtagonistA felt invigorated and alive 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never be able to go back to sleep , so ProtagonistA went to the kitchen and made a pot of coffee 
 ProtagonistA sat at the kitchen table and watched the sun come up , feeling grateful for the gift of water 
ProtagonistA leaned against the tree , ProtagonistA's eyes closed and ProtagonistA's mouth hanging open 
 ProtagonistA was tired from walking all day and just wanted to rest for a bit 
 ProtagonistA did n't hear the rustling in the bushes behind ProtagonistA until it was too late 
ProtagonistA stared up at the world , raising ProtagonistA's hoof to ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA felt so lucky to be alive 
 ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA could ever want , and ProtagonistA was surrounded by ProtagonistA's friends and family 
 What more could ProtagonistA ask for ? 
ProtagonistA stood there , still wearing ProtagonistA's royal blue dress 
 ProtagonistA had been so sure that ProtagonistB had loved ProtagonistA , that ProtagonistB had wanted to marry ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been so naïve 
 ProtagonistA felt the tears welling up in ProtagonistA's eyes , but ProtagonistA refused to give ProtagonistB the satisfaction of seeing ProtagonistA's cry 
 ProtagonistA would never let anyone take advantage of ProtagonistA like that again 
ProtagonistA wandered the quiet , wet wasteland of the forest , ProtagonistA's eyes scanning the thicket just outside the thicket 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had seen the creature in the distance 
 ProtagonistA was getting closer now , ProtagonistA could see its eyes shining in the darkness , and ProtagonistA knew it was watching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was getting closer now , ProtagonistA could see its eyes shining in the darkness , and ProtagonistA knew it was watching ProtagonistA

 ProtagonistA was getting closer now , ProtagonistA could see its eyes shining in the darkness , and ProtagonistA knew it was watching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was getting closer now , ProtagonistA could see its eyes shining in the darkness , and ProtagonistA knew it was watching ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was the only member of ProtagonistA's family who had not been disemboweled 
 ProtagonistA was the black sheep , the outcast 
 ProtagonistA lived a solitary life , but ProtagonistA was content 
 ProtagonistA did n't need anyone else , not after what had happened 
 ProtagonistA heard a loud crash and then screams 
 ProtagonistA's heart pounding , ProtagonistA ran to see what was happening 
 To ProtagonistA's horror , ProtagonistA saw a group of men with knives , slaughtering ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA tried to run , but they caught ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA fought and fought , but it was no use 
ProtagonistA was sitting on ProtagonistA's own , with a book in one hand and a pile of feathers in the other 
 ProtagonistA had found them earlier in the day , when ProtagonistA was out walking in the woods 
 At first , ProtagonistA had thought they were beautiful and had wanted to take them home 
 But now ProtagonistA was n't so sure 
 ProtagonistA could n't decide what to do and so ProtagonistA just sat there , with the book in one hand and the feathers in the other 
 ProtagonistA sighed and shook ProtagonistA's head 
  ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistB 're right ,  ProtagonistA said 
  Because ProtagonistA really do n't want to end up like poor old Mrs
 With that , ProtagonistA took a deep breath and stepped into the cart 
 However , as they neared the bottom of the hill , ProtagonistA saw something that made ProtagonistA's heart stop 
 ProtagonistB , look out !  ProtagonistA shouted 
 ProtagonistA hit the ground with a thud and lay there , motionless 
 But ProtagonistA did n't respond 
 ProtagonistA was unconscious , and ProtagonistA had no idea what was going to happen to ProtagonistA next 
ProtagonistA sat down on the bench opposite ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistA and smiled 
  Hello ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA talked for a while about their lives and their families 
 ProtagonistA started the car and began to drive away when they saw the first of the hearers - ProtagonistB running down the street with ProtagonistB's hair flying behind ProtagonistB in the wind 
 ProtagonistA quickly turned the car around and drove back to their house 
ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way back to ProtagonistA's office when ProtagonistA saw the great city of Ponyville once again 
 ProtagonistA had been away on business for a few weeks and was glad to be home 
 As ProtagonistA walked through the streets , ProtagonistA saw that everything was just as ProtagonistA had left it 
 ProtagonistA smiled and waved to the ponies ProtagonistA knew and soon ProtagonistA was back at ProtagonistA's office 
 ProtagonistA sat down at ProtagonistA's desk and got to work , feeling happy to be home 
 ProtagonistA has been this way for hours , ever since ProtagonistA was first placed in the room 
 ProtagonistA was starting to go stir - crazy 
 Finally , ProtagonistA heard the door unlock and ProtagonistB entered the room 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA just stared at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA could trust ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA still did n't say anything 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA finally found ProtagonistA's voice 
  What do ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA to do ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA thought for a moment before ProtagonistA finally nodded ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what else to do 
 ProtagonistA had to trust ProtagonistB if ProtagonistA wanted to get out of there 
 ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA did n't want to stay in that room any longer 
 ProtagonistA did everything ProtagonistB asked and finally , ProtagonistA was free 
 ProtagonistA was finally free 
ProtagonistA leaned against the tree , ProtagonistA's hooves tugging at the bark of the tree , not sure if ProtagonistA liked it 
 ProtagonistA looked around at the other trees and noticed that they all had bark on them too 
 ProtagonistA wondered if ProtagonistA was the only one who did n't like it 
 ProtagonistA decided to ask one of the other horses 
 Hey , do you like the bark on the trees ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 Me neither ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA wonder why we have to have it 
 ProtagonistA thought about it for a moment and then decided that the other horse was right 
 ProtagonistA leaned against the tree and closed ProtagonistA's eyes , enjoying the feel of the bark against ProtagonistA's skin 
ProtagonistA leaned against the tree , ProtagonistA's gaze scanning the atmosphere 
 ProtagonistA could n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on it 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes 
 But ProtagonistA stood ProtagonistA's ground 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do something 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and stepped forward 
 ProtagonistA held out ProtagonistA's hand and said ,  It 's okay , bear 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends were safe 
ProtagonistA stood there , ProtagonistA's hooves resting on the ground 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful horse , with a long mane and tail 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that something was wrong , but ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA just stood there and let ProtagonistB cry 
ProtagonistA sat down on the side of the tree , ProtagonistA's leg dangling past the tip 
 ProtagonistA looked out at the vast forest before ProtagonistA and sighed 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and allowed ProtagonistA to drift off , the sound of the leaves rustling in the breeze lulling ProtagonistA to sleep 
ProtagonistA was in a great mood today 
 ProtagonistA was whistling as ProtagonistA went about ProtagonistA's work , and ProtagonistA could n't stop smiling 
 It was a beautiful day outside , and ProtagonistA was surrounded by the people ProtagonistA loved most 
 What 's wrong , ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked , still smiling despite the sudden change in atmosphere 
 ProtagonistA knew how much ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistB's cupcakes 
  ProtagonistA can make ProtagonistB another one 
 ProtagonistA tried to console ProtagonistB , but it was no use 
ProtagonistA had been in the dark for what felt like hours 
 ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was or how ProtagonistA got there 
 ProtagonistA could hear the watch ticking away in the darkness and it was starting to give ProtagonistA a headache 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice 
  ProtagonistA , wake up 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA need to wake up 
 This time ProtagonistA was able to open ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA was back in ProtagonistA's bedroom 
 ProtagonistA must have been dreaming 
ProtagonistA was at the dinner party , waiting for ProtagonistB , to apologize for not coming sooner 
 ProtagonistA was getting impatient , as the minutes ticked by and ProtagonistB still had n't shown up 
 Finally , ProtagonistA decided to go looking for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA searched the castle from top to bottom , but there was no sign of ProtagonistB anywhere 
 ProtagonistA was just about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the dungeon 
 ProtagonistA cautiously made ProtagonistA's way down , and sure enough , there was ProtagonistB , locked in a ProtagonistA was shocked 
 ProtagonistA had no idea what ProtagonistB had done to deserve this treatment 
 But ProtagonistA was determined to get ProtagonistB out 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistC and demanded the key to the cell 
 ProtagonistA rushed to ProtagonistB's side and embraced ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA blinked at the moon and saw the glitter of the friends ' tears around ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friend were standing on the edge of a stream 
  ProtagonistA agreed 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the seat of a beach cruiser , ProtagonistA's tail wagging 
 ProtagonistA loved going for rides in the cruiser , especially when it meant going to the beach 
 ProtagonistA was beginning to get quite worn out , though ProtagonistA had n't intended for ProtagonistA's obsession to get out of control 
 ProtagonistA had just wanted to try one of those new cupcake places that had opened up down the street 
 But then ProtagonistA had gotten a taste of the creamy frosting and ProtagonistA was hooked 
 Before ProtagonistA knew it , ProtagonistA was making daily trips to the cupcake shop , and then ProtagonistA started buying them in bulk 
 ProtagonistA even started making ProtagonistA's own cupcakes at home 
 But now , ProtagonistA had run out of both money and cupcakes 
 ProtagonistA was desperate 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's friends and family were getting worried about ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA just could n't help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA needed those cupcakes 
 So , ProtagonistA hatched a plan 
 ProtagonistA would break into the cupcake shop in the middle of the night and steal some cupcakes 
 But when ProtagonistA got to the shop , ProtagonistA found that the door was locked 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up and go home when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the back of the shop 
 ProtagonistA cautiously made ProtagonistA's way towards the sound and found a door that was slightly ajar 
 ProtagonistA peeked inside and saw ProtagonistB , putting away some cupcakes 
 ProtagonistA quickly ducked back out of sight and waited for ProtagonistB to leave 
 Once ProtagonistB was gone , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way into the shop and grabbed a few cupcakes 
 ProtagonistA was about to leave when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB coming back 
 ProtagonistA hid under the counter , praying that ProtagonistB would n't find ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 're coming with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA tried to think of a good lie , but ProtagonistA was so tired and stressed from ProtagonistA's addiction that ProtagonistA could n't come up with anything 
 So , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB the truth 
  ProtagonistA 'm addicted to ProtagonistB's cupcakes ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA just ca n't help ProtagonistA 
  But ProtagonistA ca n't just steal from ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA just could n't help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was addicted to those cupcakes 
 And ProtagonistA would do anything to get ProtagonistA's fix 
ProtagonistA sat down on the edge of the bank , crossed ProtagonistA's legs , and stared out at the sea beyond the bank 
 ProtagonistA had always loved the ocean , but today it looked different 
 ProtagonistA felt a sudden urge to jump into the water and swim out to the horizon 
ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes 
 ProtagonistA was a bit tired , having made it three hours from here and had no idea how much longer that would last 
 ProtagonistA was walking in the forest , looking for a place to rest , when ProtagonistA came across a small cottage 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door , and a kind - looking old woman answered 
 ProtagonistA was so tired , ProtagonistA decided to stay the night 
 The next morning , ProtagonistA woke up and went downstairs 
 ProtagonistA ate one , and then set off on ProtagonistA's journey , feeling refreshed and energized 
ProtagonistA had been looking forward to this train ride for months 
 ProtagonistA was finally going to meet ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was excited to finally meet ProtagonistB and see what ProtagonistB was like 
 As ProtagonistA boarded the train , ProtagonistA looked around for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA expected to see an elderly , dainty man sitting beside ProtagonistA 
 Instead , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC sitting in the seat next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA was excited to start ProtagonistA's new life with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA , dressed in the highest style , sat down in the low dining- room of ProtagonistA's house on the bank of the Thames 
 ProtagonistA had just returned from a successful season in London and was eager to relax in ProtagonistA's own home 
 ProtagonistA was content to sit and enjoy the tranquility of the moment 
ProtagonistA sat down on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked down at the blank gray blue horizon 
 ProtagonistA was bored , and there was nothing to do 
 ProtagonistA had been sitting in the same spot for hours , and the only thing that had changed was the position of the sun 
 ProtagonistA was about to get up and walk around when ProtagonistA saw something in the distance 
 As it got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was a bird 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA forgot to be scared 
ProtagonistA was in the dark hall of the palace , in the stable where ProtagonistA was kept 
 ProtagonistA was talking about something ProtagonistA had done 
  ProtagonistA ca n't believe ProtagonistA did that ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and sighed 
  ProtagonistA 'm never going to do anything like that again 
  But ProtagonistA was never in a hurry 
 ProtagonistA liked to take ProtagonistA's time and smell the roses , as ProtagonistC always said 
  And ProtagonistA would follow ProtagonistB , Hurrying to keep up 
 ProtagonistA was advancing towards the brides , wearing a pointed black frock , a black skirt even shorter than ProtagonistA's hips , and heels that reached just below ProtagonistA's knees 
 ProtagonistA quickly scrambled down the bank and ran towards the sound 
 ProtagonistA could see a crowd of people gathered around something in the middle of the street 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA pushed ProtagonistA's way through the crowd and knelt down next to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was still breathing , but ProtagonistB was unconscious 
 ProtagonistA took off ProtagonistA's scarf and tied it tightly around ProtagonistB's arm to stop the bleeding 
 Then ProtagonistA turned to the crowd and shouted for someone to call an ambulance 
ProtagonistA had taken to riding into ProtagonistA's house on ProtagonistA's pink saddle hoof , noting the rows of fifth - story windows that led from ProtagonistA's backyard down into the city 
 ProtagonistA would trot down the street , ProtagonistA's pink saddle and hooves shining in the sun , and people would stop and stare 
 ProtagonistA loved the attention , but ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistC even more 
 ProtagonistC was the one who had brought ProtagonistA this far in life , and ProtagonistA was grateful for every moment they spent together 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistC and did n't want to disobey ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistA also loved ProtagonistB 
 After much thought , ProtagonistA decided to elope with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew it would make ProtagonistC angry , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA was going to marry ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was lying on ProtagonistA back in the grass , looking up at the stars 
 ProtagonistA felt someone tilt ProtagonistA back , and ProtagonistA looked up to see ProtagonistB standing over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA took it and looked through it , gasping at the sight of the stars up close 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and lay back down , staring up at the stars again 
 ProtagonistA felt at peace , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget this night 
ProtagonistA was sketching a town in the snow when ProtagonistA turned to see the stars shining brightly in the evening sky 
 Instead , ProtagonistA lay down in the snow and watched the stars until ProtagonistA fell asleep 
ProtagonistA sighed as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistA's friends ride into the forest 
 ProtagonistA had always been the more adventurous one , but since ProtagonistA's horse had been injured , ProtagonistA had been stuck at the farm 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's friends would have a great time , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little jealous 
 ProtagonistA decided to go for a walk to take ProtagonistA's mind off of things 
 As ProtagonistA was walking , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the bushes 
 ProtagonistA was about to run away when ProtagonistA saw a horse step out 
 ProtagonistA approached it cautiously and it nuzzled ProtagonistA's hand 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to take it back to the farm 
 ProtagonistA mounted the horse and rode off 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's friends would be so jealous when they saw ProtagonistA riding the horse 
ProtagonistA stepped carefully down the steps of ProtagonistA's trailer , ProtagonistA's eyes resting on the blackened metal 
 ProtagonistA 'd lived in this trailer for nearly two years , and it was the only home ProtagonistA 'd ever known 
 ProtagonistA had barely made it out alive 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do now 
 ProtagonistA had no home , no belongings , no money 
 ProtagonistA was completely alone in the world 
 But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 ProtagonistA had to find a way to start over 
ProtagonistA stood in the dim light of the distance , ProtagonistA face downcast and blue eyes fixed on the ground below 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had received the news 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to expect , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was a lamp 
 And then ProtagonistA saw the house 
 ProtagonistA walked up to the door and knocked 
 ProtagonistA heard footsteps inside , and then the door opened 
 ProtagonistA smiled and stepped inside 
  ProtagonistA 'm home ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'm finally home 
ProtagonistA , took a moment to admire the view 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was on top of the world 
 ProtagonistA was about to head back inside when ProtagonistA saw something out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye 
 It was a rainbow ! ProtagonistA had never seen one in real life before 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA started to run towards it 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that the rainbow was actually a bridge 
 And on the other side of the bridge was a castle ! ProtagonistA had never seen anything so beautiful in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was about to cross the bridge when ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name 
 I'm going to cross this bridge and explore that castle ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 That 's why ProtagonistA 'm going to find out ,  ProtagonistA said 
 And with that , ProtagonistA started to cross the bridge 
ProtagonistA leaned against the tree , ProtagonistA's hooves strumming happily 
 ProtagonistA was content to just sit there and enjoy the day 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance 
 Without hesitating , ProtagonistA ran towards the noise 
 ProtagonistA found a group of rabbits being chased by a fox 
 Without thinking , ProtagonistA leapt into action and chased the fox away 
 ProtagonistA had saved the day 
ProtagonistA stood before ProtagonistA's desk , wondering what ProtagonistA should do next 
 ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's project for hours , and ProtagonistA was starting to get tired 
 Maybe ProtagonistA should take a break and come back to it later 
 But ProtagonistA did n't want to lose ProtagonistA's momentum 
 ProtagonistA decided to keep working and see how much ProtagonistA could get done 
ProtagonistA was wiping the sweat away from ProtagonistA's forehead when ProtagonistA saw the light 
 ProtagonistA was about to go inside when ProtagonistA saw the light 
 ProtagonistA was curious , so ProtagonistA decided to investigate 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that the light was coming from a hole in the ground 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it before 
 ProtagonistA was about to call out for help when ProtagonistA heard a voice 
 ProtagonistA , come down here 
 ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA was also curious 
 ProtagonistA decided to go down the hole 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that the voice was coming from a creature 
 Who are you ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA was also excited 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to go on an adventure , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to get ProtagonistA's chance 
ProtagonistA blasted ProtagonistA's horn into the air and dropped down to the floor , hovering there , impossible 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a rebel , and this was ProtagonistA's latest stunt 
 ProtagonistA had figured out how to hover using ProtagonistA's horn , and now ProtagonistA was showing off to ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA laughed at their reactions and then floated up into the air again 
 ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life , until ProtagonistA suddenly lost control and started to fall 
 ProtagonistA panicked and tried to blast ProtagonistA's horn again , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistA hit the ground with a thud and was knocked unconscious 
 ProtagonistA swore ProtagonistA would never show off like that again 
ProtagonistA was having a tough day 
 As ProtagonistA walked through the door of ProtagonistA's apartment , ProtagonistA was not expecting anything good to happen 
 But then , ProtagonistA saw a pinkie tracing around ProtagonistA's head 
 At first , ProtagonistA thought it was a dragon , but then ProtagonistA realized it was a pegasus 
 ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA laughed out loud 
ProtagonistA leaned against the trees , ProtagonistA's head resting lightly on the large , fat trunk 
 ProtagonistA felt the rough bark against ProtagonistA's cheek and the cool air on ProtagonistA's skin 
 ProtagonistA breathed in the fresh , piney smell and closed ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA felt peaceful and calm here , surrounded by the tall trees and the chirping birds 
 ProtagonistA had come here often as a child , when ProtagonistA was sad or angry or just needed to get away from the world 
 ProtagonistA would climb to the top of the trees and sit on the branches , looking out at the world below 
 Now , as an adult , ProtagonistA still came here when ProtagonistA needed to clear ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA would sit on the ground , leaning against the tree , and let the world around ProtagonistA fade away 
 For a little while , ProtagonistA could just be 
ProtagonistA stroked the buttons of ProtagonistA's blouse , feeling the softness beneath ProtagonistA's skin 
 ProtagonistA loved the way the fabric felt against ProtagonistA's fingertips and the way the buttons clicked when ProtagonistA ran ProtagonistA's fingers over them 
 ProtagonistA twirled in front of the mirror , admiring the way the fabric flowed around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt like a princess in a fairy tale 
 ProtagonistA was always so perfect and put - together , and ProtagonistB was a bit of a mess 
 But then ProtagonistA did something unexpected 
 ProtagonistA reached out and touched ProtagonistB's cheek , wiping away a stray tear 
  It 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA sat on the bank , ProtagonistA's hooves carefully below the surface of the water , ProtagonistA's flat chest and shy muzzle showing the attention of the natural beauty 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful young mare , and the forest was ProtagonistA's home 
 ProtagonistA loved the peace and quiet of the woods , and the gentle trickle of the stream was like music to ProtagonistA's ears 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let out a soft sigh , enjoying the warm sun on ProtagonistA's skin 
ProtagonistA sat on the ground , ProtagonistA's hooves resting in front of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful horse , with a long , flowing mane and a sleek , muscular body 
 ProtagonistA was the fastest horse in the world , and ProtagonistA knew it 
 ProtagonistA had won many races , and ProtagonistA was the only horse that had ever been able to beat the legendary Black Stallion 
 ProtagonistA was old , and ProtagonistA's racing days were behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was content to spend ProtagonistA's days grazing in the pasture , and ProtagonistA was happy to be surrounded by ProtagonistA's family - ProtagonistA's husband , ProtagonistA's foals , and ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA was happy , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit sad when ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's racing days 
 ProtagonistA missed the thrill of the race , the wind in ProtagonistA's mane , and the feeling of crossing the finish line first 
 But ProtagonistA was content , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had had a good life 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's saddle and watched the sun rise over the high hills 
 ProtagonistA had been riding all night , and ProtagonistA was tired 
 But ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistA's way back home 
 ProtagonistA rode over a hill and saw a small cabin in the distance 
 ProtagonistA rode to the cabin and knocked on the door 
 ProtagonistA asked if ProtagonistA could stay there for a while 
ProtagonistA sat down on the golden throne in ProtagonistA's tower , and ProtagonistA looked out at the sea of stars that stretched before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was the Queen of the Night , and this was ProtagonistA's kingdom 
 ProtagonistA ruled over the stars and the darkness , and ProtagonistA was beautiful and powerful 
 ProtagonistA was also lonely 
 ProtagonistA had no one to share ProtagonistA's kingdom with , and ProtagonistA longed for someone to love 
 One night , ProtagonistA saw a shooting star streaking across the sky , and ProtagonistA made a wish 
 ProtagonistA wished for someone to love ProtagonistA , and to share ProtagonistA's kingdom with ProtagonistA 
 The next night , ProtagonistA saw the same shooting star , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's wish had been granted 
ProtagonistA , sat at ProtagonistB's desk , ProtagonistA's hooves resting on the very smooth surface of the paper 
 ProtagonistA had been curious about this strange object ever since ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB using it 
 ProtagonistA had been trying to figure out how to use it ProtagonistA , but so far , ProtagonistA had n't had much success 
 ProtagonistA quickly jumped off the desk , hoping ProtagonistA had n't been caught 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA immediately started trying to write ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had finally figured out how to use the desk 
ProtagonistA stood in the doorway of the bank , and the crystal ball was spinning in ProtagonistA's fingers 
 ProtagonistA quickly put ProtagonistA's plan into action and within minutes , ProtagonistA had the money from the bank in ProtagonistA's hands 
 ProtagonistA was laughing as ProtagonistA ran away from the scene of the crime , knowing that ProtagonistA had gotten away with the perfect crime 
ProtagonistA cracked open ProtagonistA's newspaper , nudged the option beneath the headline Today , ProtagonistA was going to write a story about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been meaning to for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had first met ProtagonistB 
 As ProtagonistA began to write , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA getting more and more into the story 
 ProtagonistA detailed ProtagonistB's life , from ProtagonistB's childhood to ProtagonistB's present day 
 ProtagonistA wrote about ProtagonistB's successes and ProtagonistB's failures , ProtagonistB's relationships and ProtagonistB's friendships 
 ProtagonistA even included a quote from ProtagonistB , about the importance of always moving forward 
 By the time ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had really captured who ProtagonistB was as a person 
 ProtagonistA hoped that ProtagonistA's readers would feel the same way 
ProtagonistA whistled an old , hoof - tired tune as ProtagonistA peered around the edge of ProtagonistA's cottage at the vast , arid expanse beyond the great umbrella of emerald leaves that crowned the ceiling 
 ProtagonistA had been living in this cottage for years , ever since ProtagonistA had been forced to retire from ProtagonistA's post as a royal guard 
 It was n't the life ProtagonistA had envisioned for ProtagonistA , but it was peaceful and ProtagonistA was content 
 As a child , ProtagonistA had dreamed of becoming a knight like ProtagonistA's father 
 When ProtagonistA was old enough , ProtagonistA enlisted in the guard and worked ProtagonistA's way up the ranks 
 For years , ProtagonistA served the ProtagonistC and queen faithfully 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a twinge of jealousy , but ProtagonistA pushed it down 
 ProtagonistA was happy in ProtagonistA's cottage and did n't need ProtagonistC's approval 
 But now , as ProtagonistA looked out at the empty wasteland , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a sense of longing 
 ProtagonistA missed the excitement of Camelot 
 ProtagonistA missed the king and queen 
 And , most of all , ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA sat up on the front step of the house with ProtagonistA's eyes closed 
 ProtagonistA was trying to remember the dream ProtagonistA had just been having 
 ProtagonistA could n't quite remember 
 ProtagonistA heard someone coming up the walk and ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes 
   ProtagonistA 'm fine , thank ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA was just trying to remember a dream ProtagonistA had 
   Thanks , you too ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB walk away and then ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes again 
 Maybe if ProtagonistA concentrated hard enough , ProtagonistA could remember the dream 
ProtagonistA was driving home from the hospital after a terrible accident in which ProtagonistA had been struck by a bus 
 ProtagonistA was in a lot of pain and ProtagonistA's head was throbbing 
 As ProtagonistA drove , ProtagonistA saw a sign for a new development called Sunrise Estates 
 ProtagonistA decided to turn in and take a look 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could really start fresh here 
 ProtagonistA drove up to the model home and got out to take a look around 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's head and ProtagonistA collapsed to the ground 
 ProtagonistA was unconscious for several minutes 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was in a hospital bed 
 ProtagonistA had been so close to starting over , but now ProtagonistA's life was completely changed 
 ProtagonistA would have to rely on others for everything from now on 
ProtagonistA had been sitting in the library for hours , poring over old books and dusty scrolls 
 ProtagonistA was looking for any clues that could help ProtagonistA find the lost city of Atlantis 
 ProtagonistA was getting close , ProtagonistA could feel it 
 ProtagonistA had been hiding it there for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had started ProtagonistA's research 
 ProtagonistA stood up and stretched ProtagonistA's arms 
 ProtagonistA was getting a cramp in ProtagonistA back from leaning over the desk for so long 
 ProtagonistA looked around the library , making sure that no one was watching , and then quickly opened the trunk and grabbed ProtagonistA's notebook 
 ProtagonistA tucked it under ProtagonistA's arm and sat back down at the desk , opening it to the page where ProtagonistA had left off 
 ProtagonistA was so close , ProtagonistA could feel it 
 ProtagonistA just needed one more piece of the puzzle and ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA would find Atlantis 
 ProtagonistA just had to keep looking 
ProtagonistA was a hasty and groping traveller , always carrying some form of burdens on ProtagonistA's back , but the Seven Seas of Latron on the banks of the river had always been a friendlier place 
 But now , as ProtagonistA approached the Seven Seas , ProtagonistA could see that something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA could sense that something bad was about to happen 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that the riverbank was littered with the bodies of animals - fish , birds , mammals 
 ProtagonistA had to do something 
 But what could ProtagonistA do ? ProtagonistA was just one person 
 Then ProtagonistA remembered ProtagonistA's mother 's words :  If ProtagonistA ever feel lost , ProtagonistA , just remember that ProtagonistA have the power to make a difference 
 ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA had to do 
 ProtagonistA had to warn the people of Latron about what was happening to the Seven Seas 
 ProtagonistA raced back to the town as fast as ProtagonistA could and sounded the alarm 
 And ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had made a difference 
ProtagonistA was going through ProtagonistA's old keepsakes from when ProtagonistA was younger 
 ProtagonistA came across a little book that ProtagonistA used to read all the time 
 ProtagonistA remembered how much ProtagonistA loved the stories in the book 
 ProtagonistA wondered why ProtagonistA had never read it again 
 ProtagonistA decided to read it again 
 ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA had found the book again 
ProtagonistA had been through so much , so many times , that ProtagonistA 'd reached the point where ProtagonistA 'd stopped caring what happened to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was numb to the pain , the hurt , the suffering 
 ProtagonistA 'd been through it all before and ProtagonistA knew that , eventually , ProtagonistA would make it through again 
 This time , though , ProtagonistA was tired 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to give up 
 So , when ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in the middle of yet another difficult situation , ProtagonistA did n't fight 
 ProtagonistA did n't try to find a way out 
 ProtagonistA just let go and allowed ProtagonistA to be consumed by the darkness 
ProtagonistA stepped out of the greenhouse , whirled , and threw ProtagonistA's head back 
 ProtagonistA breathed in the fresh air and smiled 
 When ProtagonistA was younger , ProtagonistA had been scared of ProtagonistB , but now ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a kind and wise old man 
 Oh , not much ,  ProtagonistA replied 
  ProtagonistA 've just been waiting for the moment , talking to ProtagonistB , when it would happen 
 And what is it that ProtagonistA 're waiting for , ProtagonistB's dear?I'm waiting for ProtagonistA's feet to grow , so that ProtagonistA can go barefoot more often 
  And why do ProtagonistA want to go barefoot more often?I do n't know ,  ProtagonistA said 
 And why do ProtagonistA want ProtagonistA's hands to be less clumsy?So that ProtagonistA can do more things with them 
 ProtagonistA want to be able to write and draw and build things 
  And have ProtagonistA been doing any of those things?Yes ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 've been writing stories and drawing pictures 
 And ProtagonistA just finished building a model of a castle out of cardboard boxes 
 I am ,  ProtagonistA said 
  But ProtagonistA 'm still waiting for the moment when it will all come together and ProtagonistA 'll be able to do even more 
 ProtagonistA was of a small family , and though no one in that family should have been more than ten years my senior , ProtagonistA's father was very strong and good - looking , but had no money 
 ProtagonistA had everything else that was desired , and everything ProtagonistA asked for was granted without any regard to the wants of others 
ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's wings for more than a year when ProtagonistA discovered what ProtagonistB , had been planning for a good long while 
 ProtagonistA was able to escape , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to warn the king 
 ProtagonistA flew as fast as ProtagonistA could to the palace and told the king what was happening 
ProtagonistA was excited to be embarking on ProtagonistA's voyage to the new world of the North 
 ProtagonistA hoped for the vast riches that lay in store for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was amazed by the sights and sounds of this new land 
 ProtagonistA quickly made friends with the locals and began to learn about the culture and customs 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistA's journey to the North 
ProtagonistA should have known better 
 ProtagonistA was standing on the edge of a granite threshold , in the middle of a war , and ProtagonistA was not winning 
 ProtagonistA 's not going to be able to keep it up all night 
ProtagonistA peered into ProtagonistA's book , half - listening , half - expecting ProtagonistA's sister to speak 
 ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA listening to me?Yes , ProtagonistA 'm listening ,  ProtagonistA said , trying to sound patient 
 ProtagonistA sighed 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's book and turned to ProtagonistA's sister 
 ProtagonistA could n't wait to get back to it 
ProtagonistA sat down and just watched as ProtagonistB squatted beside ProtagonistA and watched ProtagonistB draw ProtagonistB's bow and day out 
 As ProtagonistA watched , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB take careful aim and then release the arrow 
 ProtagonistA clapped ProtagonistA's hands in excitement , eager to try it ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA continued to practice , and before long , ProtagonistA was hitting the target just as accurately as ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was proud of ProtagonistA and grateful to ProtagonistB for teaching ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had waited all summer for ProtagonistA's chance to go to the water park 
 When ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA was so excited to go down the slides 
 ProtagonistA went down the first one and it was so much fun 
 ProtagonistA went down the second one and it was even more fun 
 ProtagonistA was having so much fun that ProtagonistA did n't want to leave 
ProtagonistA does n't think ProtagonistA 'll be going back to school , ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA 's not sure what ProtagonistA's parents will say , but ProtagonistA 's going to talk to them about it soon 
ProtagonistA sat by ProtagonistA's window and hoped that the sun was n't up 
 ProtagonistA had been up all night , and ProtagonistA was exhausted 
 ProtagonistA wanted to sleep , but ProtagonistA was afraid that if ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA would miss the sun 
 ProtagonistA had been waiting for it to rise for hours , and ProtagonistA did n't want to miss it 
 Finally , ProtagonistA saw the first ray of sunlight , and ProtagonistA sighed in relief 
 ProtagonistA watched as the sun slowly rose in the sky , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's eyelids getting heavy 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should stay awake , but ProtagonistA could n't help it 
 ProtagonistA fell asleep , and ProtagonistA missed the sun 
ProtagonistA sat at ProtagonistA's desk and watched as ProtagonistB leaned ProtagonistB's head onto ProtagonistA's shoulder 
 ProtagonistA was content just to sit there and be with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was going through a tough time and ProtagonistA wanted to be there for ProtagonistB , even if it was just in silence 
ProtagonistA was walking through the woods , thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how ProtagonistA wished things were different 
 ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistB and how ProtagonistB always seemed to be so strict with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could just leave and never come back 
 As ProtagonistA was thinking these things , ProtagonistA heard a noise behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw a man with a knife , coming towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die 
 As the man got closer , ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA ,  Oh , f - f - fucks if ProtagonistA kill you now 
  ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistB had not forbidden ProtagonistA to leave 
 ProtagonistA could hear the screams of the people around ProtagonistA , and the sound of the buildings collapsing 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get out of there , but ProtagonistA did n't know how 
 ProtagonistA tried to run , but ProtagonistA's legs would n't move 
 ProtagonistA tried to call for help , but ProtagonistA's voice would n't work 
 ProtagonistA knew this was the end 
ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's home world of Equestria when ProtagonistA was eight years old 
 ProtagonistA was the only one of ProtagonistA's kind , a human , and ProtagonistA did n't fit in 
 ProtagonistA was always getting into trouble , and ProtagonistA's parents had had enough 
 ProtagonistA was not happy in the human world 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's friends and the magic of Equestria 
 ProtagonistA was always getting into trouble , and ProtagonistA's aunt was always yelling at ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA ran away from home , hoping to find ProtagonistA's way back to Equestria 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to get there , but ProtagonistA was determined 
 ProtagonistA walked for days , until ProtagonistA came to a strange door in the middle of the forest 
 ProtagonistA opened it and walked through , into a whole new world 
 ProtagonistA was amazed 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it 
 ProtagonistA was happy to be back in Equestria , even if ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to get home 
ProtagonistA was lying on the floor of ProtagonistA's room , bending forward 
 ProtagonistA had been there for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had received the news 
 ProtagonistA was only twenty - five 
 ProtagonistA heard the door open and ProtagonistB came in 
 ProtagonistA turned to ProtagonistB and buried ProtagonistA's face in ProtagonistB's shoulder 
 ProtagonistA cried until ProtagonistA had no tears left 
 Then ProtagonistA got up and walked out of the room 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep going , even though ProtagonistA did n't know how 
ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistA's hoof out of ProtagonistB's eyes , but fished out a few strands of pony hair , like ProtagonistA always had 
 Whenever ProtagonistA would find a stray hair on ProtagonistB's head , ProtagonistA would carefully remove it , making sure not to hurt ProtagonistB 
 Even though ProtagonistB was now a grown pony , ProtagonistA still liked to do it 
ProtagonistA stopped smoking and looked up from the book ProtagonistA was reading 
 ProtagonistA had been trying to quit for a while , but this was the first time ProtagonistA had been able to stick with it 
 ProtagonistA felt good about ProtagonistA and was determined to keep going 
 ProtagonistA was halfway through the book when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had been smoking without even thinking about it 
 ProtagonistA put the book down and decided to go for a walk to clear ProtagonistA's head 
 As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA thought about all the reasons ProtagonistA wanted to quit smoking 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be healthy , save money , and set a good example for ProtagonistA's kids 
 ProtagonistA was determined to make this work and to never go back to smoking 
When ProtagonistA woke , ProtagonistA wakened up as ProtagonistA always did 
 ProtagonistA could n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but something in the air was different 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and walked to the window , looking out at the street below 
 ProtagonistA rubbed ProtagonistA's eyes , thinking ProtagonistA was still dreaming 
 ProtagonistA was wide awake , and the world was different 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how or why , but ProtagonistA knew that something amazing had happened 
ProtagonistA had always wished ProtagonistA had been born in a different time and place 
 ProtagonistA was the oldest of six children and ProtagonistA's parents were very strict 
 ProtagonistA was always doing chores around the house or helping ProtagonistA's mother in the garden 
 ProtagonistA dreamed of a life where ProtagonistA could travel and see the world 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be an actress or a singer 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could never have that life in ProtagonistA's small town 
 One day , ProtagonistA saw a group of girls walking down the street 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could be like them 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be free and have fun 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never have that life in ProtagonistA's small town 
ProtagonistA should 've said no 
 ProtagonistA should 've said no to the Mad Hatter 's tea party 
 But ProtagonistA did n't and now ProtagonistA was stuck here , dancing and singing with a bunch of animals 
 ProtagonistA was having a good time , ProtagonistA could n't deny that 
 But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should 've said no 
ProtagonistA had been very pondering how to spend the week before wearing ProtagonistA's crown 
 ProtagonistA thought about all of the fun ProtagonistA could have and all of the people ProtagonistA could see 
 ProtagonistA also thought about how ProtagonistA would feel when ProtagonistA was wearing ProtagonistA's crown 
 Finally , ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA would spend the week before wearing ProtagonistA's crown by doing something ProtagonistA had never done before 
 ProtagonistA would go on an adventure ! ProtagonistA would explore the world and see all of the amazing things it had to offer 
 ProtagonistA would make new friends and create memories that would last a lifetime 
ProtagonistA had never managed to get used to the idea that ProtagonistA had to be the only pony on the grounds or the ground in order to do anything without prompting 
 Even though ProtagonistA had been living in the same house for years , ProtagonistA still felt like ProtagonistA needed to be on the lookout for any ponies that might be lurking around 
ProtagonistA had been looking forward to ProtagonistA's apple all day 
 ProtagonistA had been extra careful to not bruise it when ProtagonistA packed it in ProtagonistA's lunch bag 
 ProtagonistA frowned at it , wondering what ProtagonistA could have done differently 
 Maybe ProtagonistA should have eaten it sooner 
 Or maybe ProtagonistA should have put it in a different bag 
ProtagonistA had only once thought ProtagonistA would have a family , but now ProtagonistA believed that it was n't such a bad idea 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner and never really felt the need for a partner or children , but as ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA started to feel differently 
 Maybe it was because all ProtagonistA's friends were getting married and having kids , or maybe ProtagonistA was just feeling lonely , but whatever the reason , ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA wanted to try for a family of ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA started dating and went on a few dates with some nice guys , but none of them felt like the right fit 
 Then ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was kind , funny , and most importantly , ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistA was the only person in the world that mattered 
 ProtagonistA was happy and felt like ProtagonistA had finally found the family ProtagonistA always wanted 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had two beautiful children together and they were always surrounded by love 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA made the right decision when ProtagonistA decided to try for a family of ProtagonistA's own 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's hind legs on the deck of the large ship , watching the sun set on the horizon 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything so beautiful in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could reach out and touch the sun 
 ProtagonistA tried to scream , but no sound would come out 
 ProtagonistA tried to run , but ProtagonistA's feet were rooted to the spot 
 ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistB's cold , slimy skin against ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA could smell ProtagonistB's foul breath 
 ProtagonistA 're coming with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA could n't resist as ProtagonistB dragged ProtagonistA away 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistB was taking ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA knew it could n't be good 
 ProtagonistA was terrified of what ProtagonistB might do to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA tried to struggle , but it was no use 
 ProtagonistA was completely helpless against ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 's ready to get out and see the world 
 ProtagonistA 's not sure where ProtagonistA 's going to go , but ProtagonistA knows it 's time for a change 
 ProtagonistA knows they 'll miss ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA ca n't stay here any longer 
ProtagonistA was lying on ProtagonistA's back , gazing up into the sky 
 ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace wash over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA watched the clouds drift by 
 ProtagonistA was content just to lie there and take in the beauty of the day 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA sat up and looked around , but there was no one there 
 ProtagonistA shrugged and lay back down , but the voice came again , louder this time 
 ProtagonistA got up and followed the sound until ProtagonistA came to the edge of a cliff 
 ProtagonistA looked down and saw ProtagonistB far below , clutching at the edge of a precipice 
 Without hesitation , ProtagonistA leapt off the cliff and flew down to save ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful horse , but ProtagonistA was also very old 
 But now , ProtagonistA was getting old , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would soon have to leave the library 
 ProtagonistA was sad , but ProtagonistA was also excited to see what the world outside the library was like 
ProtagonistA stretched out ProtagonistA's forelegs , rested the hind legs on the side of ProtagonistA's neck , and looked around 
 ProtagonistA saw the trees and the flowers and the birds and felt so happy 
 ProtagonistA was so lucky to be alive 
ProtagonistA looked around the vast plain of the agricultural landscape that surrounded ProtagonistA's castle 
 As queen , ProtagonistA was responsible for the wellbeing of all ProtagonistA's subjects , and ProtagonistA took that responsibility very seriously 
 ProtagonistA knew that the key to a prosperous kingdom was a thriving economy , and that meant making sure that the farmers had what they needed to produce a bountiful harvest 
 ProtagonistA would have to make sure that the castle had a good supply of food , so that ProtagonistA's people would never go hungry 
ProtagonistA stood and watched ProtagonistA's sister Dash ProtagonistB float by 
ProtagonistA had spent the day trying to convince ProtagonistB to let ProtagonistA's ride to the Everfree 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being stuck in ProtagonistC and wanted to explore the forest 
 ProtagonistA called out , but there was no answer 
 ProtagonistA began to feel scared and alone 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name 
 But ProtagonistA was not amused 
 ProtagonistA was angry and scared 
At the time , ProtagonistA was just about to head off to meet ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been trying to get ProtagonistB to come with ProtagonistA for weeks , but ProtagonistB always said no 
 ProtagonistA was finally going to convince ProtagonistB today 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB's house and knocked on the door 
 When ProtagonistB answered , ProtagonistA started talking 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the great time they would have and how much fun they would have 
ProtagonistA woke up to the sound of the engines hum and ProtagonistA sat up , rubbing ProtagonistA's sleepy eyes 
 ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was in the middle of a grand , wide , open airship 
 ProtagonistA got up and walked to the edge of the airship , admiring the view 
 ProtagonistA saw the other airships in the fleet , and the ground far below 
 ProtagonistA felt a sense of awe and wonder at the sight 
ProtagonistA was a princess and ProtagonistA was not going anywhere 
 ProtagonistA was content to stay in ProtagonistA's castle and rule ProtagonistA's kingdom 
 ProtagonistA had a loyal subjects and a loving family 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life the way it was 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistA eventually agreed 
 ProtagonistA left her kingdom behind and went off to live with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's new life , but ProtagonistA always missed ProtagonistA's old kingdom 
 ProtagonistA loved the sea and everything about it 
 ProtagonistA loved the way it smelled , the way it sounded , and the way it made ProtagonistA feel 
 ProtagonistA felt so free and alive when ProtagonistA was on the sea 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a loud noise and felt the vessel shake 
 ProtagonistA realized that they were under attack by pirates ! ProtagonistA quickly ran to ProtagonistA's cabin and grabbed ProtagonistA's sword 
 ProtagonistA ran back up on deck and started fighting the pirates 
 ProtagonistA managed to kill a few of the pirates before ProtagonistA was finally captured 
 ProtagonistA was so angry and frustrated 
 ProtagonistA had never been one to give up , but it seemed like there was no way out of this one 
 ProtagonistA was going to die in that cell unless ProtagonistA could find a way to escape 
ProtagonistA was standing there , wondering how to explain ProtagonistA's pregnancy without sounding like an idiot 
 ProtagonistA had only been with ProtagonistB for a few months , and ProtagonistA was already pregnant 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to tell ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistB would be mad 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and decided to just tell ProtagonistB the truth 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's house and knocked on the door 
 Then , ProtagonistB asked ,  ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA was n't sure , but ProtagonistA thought it had something to do with the fact that they had unprotected sex 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping ProtagonistB would be happy about the news 
ProtagonistA had ruptured ProtagonistA's ACL playing soccer with ProtagonistA's friends 
 After much thought , ProtagonistA decided to have the surgery 
 ProtagonistA was very grateful for ProtagonistB's help 
 Without ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would not have been able to get through ProtagonistA's recovery 
 Now , ProtagonistA is back to playing soccer and is even better than before 
 ProtagonistA is truly thankful for ProtagonistB and the support ProtagonistB provided during ProtagonistA's time of need 
“ Now , ” said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA sat down in ProtagonistA's chair , “ ProtagonistA want to tell you a story 
 ” ProtagonistA paused for a moment , collecting ProtagonistA's thoughts 
 ProtagonistA lived in a world that was very different from our own 
 ProtagonistA paused again , ProtagonistA's eyes wide as ProtagonistA remembered the Jabberwocks 
 “ One day , ProtagonistA decided ProtagonistA was going to kill a Jabberwock 
 ProtagonistA went into the forest , where they lived , and ProtagonistA found one 
 ProtagonistA fought it , and ProtagonistA killed it 
 ProtagonistA leaned back in ProtagonistA's chair , a satisfied look on ProtagonistA's face 
 “ And that ’s the end of the story , ” ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA just smiled and shrugged 
 “ It ’s true , ” ProtagonistA said 
 “ ProtagonistA killed a Jabberwock 
ProtagonistA sat in the back seat of ProtagonistA's pink and white pony wagon and watched the clouds drift away 
 ProtagonistA loved the way they looked like big , fluffy marshmallows 
 Just watching the clouds , mom ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 Okay ,  ProtagonistA said , getting out of the wagon 
 As ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistA's mom into the house , ProtagonistA could n't help but smile 
 ProtagonistA was so lucky to have such a wonderful life 
ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and sent a gentle , sinking beam of red light across the smooth white ground 
 ProtagonistA had always loved coming to this place , ever since ProtagonistA was a little girl 
 ProtagonistA sighed and continued to move the beam of light across the ground 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what else to do 
 But then , ProtagonistA saw something in the distance 
 ProtagonistA started to walk towards the light , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized it was a campfire 
 ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , and soon ProtagonistA was running towards the fire 
 ProtagonistA was safe now 
 ProtagonistA was finally safe 
ProtagonistA was at a party with ProtagonistA's friends when ProtagonistA saw the funniest thing 
 ProtagonistA laughed so hard ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was dead 
 ProtagonistA was just enjoying a good laugh 
ProtagonistA did n't come out of the desert for no good reason , said ProtagonistA , as the words struck up in ProtagonistA's throat 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and ProtagonistA's throat was dry 
 ProtagonistA had been following a map that ProtagonistA found , hoping it would lead ProtagonistA to water 
 And now , finally , ProtagonistA had arrived 
 ProtagonistA had made it 
 ProtagonistA had found the oasis 
ProtagonistA was out for a run when ProtagonistA saw the bear 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA should be scared , but ProtagonistA's mind was calm and ProtagonistA's body was strong 
 ProtagonistA was able to keep running until ProtagonistA got to safety 
ProtagonistA stood with ProtagonistA's hooves on the other side of the barrier , watching the ponies through the small crack in the glass 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to be one of them , to feel the soft grass beneath ProtagonistA's hooves and the sun on ProtagonistA's back 
 But ProtagonistA knew that was never going to happen 
 So ProtagonistA had run away , to this place where ProtagonistA could watch them and feel like ProtagonistA belonged , even if it was from a distance 
ProtagonistA lay awake overnight , dreaming of a new day in ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA stood in front of the camera , ProtagonistA's eyes bluish as a heart 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a white dress with blue flowers embroidered around the hem 
ProtagonistA had been behind the wheel of the truck for nearly two hours and most of that time ProtagonistA did n't even care what the heck was happening around ProtagonistA 
 All ProtagonistA cared about was getting to ProtagonistA's destination 
 But now , as ProtagonistA was getting closer and closer , ProtagonistA started to pay more attention to ProtagonistA's surroundings 
 ProtagonistA saw the signs for the town ProtagonistA was looking for and ProtagonistA started to get excited 
 ProtagonistA was almost there 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA had made it 
 ProtagonistA pulled into the town and stopped at the first gas station ProtagonistA saw 
 ProtagonistA needed to fill up before ProtagonistA went any further 
 ProtagonistA got out of the truck and stretched ProtagonistA's legs 
 ProtagonistA looked around and saw that the town was small and quaint 
 ProtagonistA went into the gas station and paid for ProtagonistA's gas 
 Then ProtagonistA got back in the truck and continued on ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA was going to find the perfect place to live in this town 
 ProtagonistA just knew it 
ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's short life 
 Now , years later , ProtagonistA is a strong and independent woman 
 ProtagonistA has never forgotten ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA is determined to find ProtagonistB one day to thank ProtagonistB 
 In the year 1763 , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were the only residents of the village of Neuve - Chalmers 
 One day , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were out walking in the forest when they came across a small cottage 
ProtagonistA had spent the majority of ProtagonistA's life as a woman 
 ProtagonistA had a successful career and a happy family 
 However , ProtagonistA always felt something was missing 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like ProtagonistA was living in a man 's world 
 ProtagonistA decided to transition and become the woman ProtagonistA always knew ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA is now living ProtagonistA's best life as ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA rested ProtagonistA's forelegs on ProtagonistA's elbows and let out a deep breath 
 ProtagonistA had just finished ProtagonistA's last project and was looking forward to a weekend of rest 
 ProtagonistA was about to get up from ProtagonistA's desk when ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door 
 ProtagonistA got up to answer it and found a delivery man with a package for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA signed for it and took it inside 
 ProtagonistA opened it up and found a beautiful dress inside 
 ProtagonistA held it up to ProtagonistA and smiled 
 ProtagonistA could n't wait to wear it and show it off 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and dreamed of a new world 
 ProtagonistA dreamed of a world where ProtagonistA was the queen , and everyone bowed down to ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was still on ProtagonistA's haunches , but ProtagonistA was in a new world 
 The two of them looked at each other , and then ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistA did n't mean to disturb you 
 ProtagonistA need to get out and see the world 
  But ProtagonistA ca n't stay here any longer 
 ProtagonistA hope you understand 
 With that , ProtagonistA turned and walked out of the room , leaving Rainbow Dash and Eeyore alone 
ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes 
 ProtagonistA 'd never been bad in ProtagonistA's life , had ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistA 'd always been a sponge 
 But ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes and ProtagonistA wanted more 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be bad 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be the kind of person who did n't care about anyone but ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be the kind of person who would take what ProtagonistA wanted , no matter who it hurt 
 And so ProtagonistA became that person 
 ProtagonistA became the kind of person who would do anything to get what ProtagonistA wanted 
 And ProtagonistA loved it 
ProtagonistA had lived a long and happy life 
 But now , at the age of 76 , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's time was coming to an end 
 So , on the second day of August , ProtagonistA made the decision to end ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA took a large dose of sleeping pills and lay down in ProtagonistA's bed , knowing that ProtagonistA would never wake up again 
 As ProtagonistA drifted off to sleep , ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistA's family and all the happy memories ProtagonistA had made over the years 
 ProtagonistA was at peace knowing that ProtagonistA's life had been a good one 
ProtagonistA looked rather like a bimbos older or younger than ProtagonistA had been when ProtagonistA first met ProtagonistB for the first time , considering the circumstances 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a tight dress and high heels , and ProtagonistA's hair was styled in a way that made ProtagonistA look like ProtagonistA was ready for a night out on the town 
 ProtagonistA denied everything , but ProtagonistB was not convinced 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had been meeting men for money 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA needed the money , and ProtagonistA did not know what else to do 
ProtagonistA was far away , so distant that it was hard to remember when ProtagonistA had come 
 ProtagonistA had been wandering for what felt like years , ever since ProtagonistA had fallen down the rabbit hole 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's home and ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA missed the warmth of the sun on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA missed the sound of laughter 
 ProtagonistA even missed the sound of ProtagonistA's own voice 
 ProtagonistA had been talking to ProtagonistA more and more lately , just to hear the sound of a human voice 
 ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA was losing ProtagonistA's mind 
 ProtagonistA was so tired of walking , but ProtagonistA could n't seem to stop 
 ProtagonistA had to keep going , even though ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going or why 
 ProtagonistA just kept walking , through the endless forest , until ProtagonistA came to a clearing 
 ProtagonistA walked up to the house and knocked on the door 
  ProtagonistA walked into the house , and ProtagonistA was immediately filled with a sense of peace 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was finally home 
ProtagonistA had never been to a Princess party before , and ProtagonistA loved the idea of it 
 ProtagonistA loved the idea of being treated like a princess , and ProtagonistA loved the idea of being surrounded by other princesses 
 When ProtagonistA arrived at the party , ProtagonistA was amazed by the decorations and the food 
 ProtagonistA was also amazed by the other princesses 
 ProtagonistA had a great time at the party , and ProtagonistA even got to dance with the prince 
ProtagonistA had been travelling west , but ProtagonistA's eyes had been paid to the south , where the sun shone and the air was still and fragrant , the colour of wheat or millet 
 ProtagonistA had been on the road for days , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and ProtagonistA's back was aching 
 But ProtagonistA pushed on , drawn by the promise of the sun 
 Finally , ProtagonistA reached the edge of the forest 
 ProtagonistA paused for a moment , looking back the way ProtagonistA had come 
 Then ProtagonistA took a deep breath and stepped out into the sunlight 
 ProtagonistA stumbled forward a few steps , and then sank to ProtagonistA's knees 
 ProtagonistA was dimly aware of voices calling ProtagonistA's name , but ProtagonistA could n't seem to focus on them 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends had just finished taking a trip with Rarity 
 ProtagonistA hesitated at first , unsure if ProtagonistA wanted to help or not , but ProtagonistC could see the love and appreciation in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 Not only did ProtagonistA feel good about ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA also felt closer to ProtagonistB than ever before 
When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was so excited ProtagonistA had barely remembered what had happened the night before 
 ProtagonistA had been to the best party ever , and ProtagonistA was just about to go to bed when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's phone at the club 
 ProtagonistA was so upset that ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's phone , and ProtagonistA was even more upset when ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's purse at the club as well 
 ProtagonistA was so upset that ProtagonistA decided to go back to the club to look for ProtagonistA's phone and ProtagonistA's purse 
 When ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's purse , but ProtagonistA could n't find ProtagonistA's phone 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA's phone , and ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had seen it , but ProtagonistB did n't know where it was 
 ProtagonistA was so upset that ProtagonistA decided to go home 
 When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA went to bed , and ProtagonistA was so tired that ProtagonistA fell asleep 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA could hear the water moving up from the lake 
 ProtagonistA sat down on the bank and watched the sun set behind the trees 
 The colors were so beautiful , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let the sound of the water lull ProtagonistA to sleep 
ProtagonistA had been so anxious for ProtagonistB to take ProtagonistA's first flight ProtagonistA had not known until that moment that the spell they were about to cast was for something else altogether 
 ProtagonistA had been so excited to finally be able to experience what it was like to fly and see the world from above 
 But as ProtagonistA stood there , ready to take off , ProtagonistA realized that this was not what ProtagonistB had meant at all 
 ProtagonistA could feel the magic taking hold of ProtagonistA , pulling ProtagonistA into the unknown 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to expect , but ProtagonistA knew that whatever was waiting for ProtagonistA , it would be an adventure 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who had recently lost ProtagonistA's husband 
 ProtagonistA was grieving and wanted to get away from everything 
 ProtagonistA heard about a place called New - Heaven and decided to go there 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could start over again in this place 
 ProtagonistA settled down in a secluded laird 's house 
 ProtagonistA started to make friends and soon became a part of the community 
 ProtagonistA started a new life in New - Heaven and was happy there 
 It was a difficult feat , but ProtagonistA was determined to succeed 
 ProtagonistA had been practicing for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to get the hang of it 
 ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's best friend , and ProtagonistB was so proud of ProtagonistA for never giving up 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the rocking chair , ProtagonistB's hooves beneath ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA rocked gently back and forth , a content expression on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA looked down at ProtagonistB , a soft smile on ProtagonistA's lips 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would grow up to be a strong , independent mare , but for now ProtagonistA was happy to just sit and enjoy the moment 
ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's wings for four years when ProtagonistA discovered that ProtagonistA was pregnant 
 ProtagonistA was content , however , to raise ProtagonistA's child and watch it grow 
ProtagonistA had been wandering the land for years at that point , but it was the first time that ProtagonistA had really felt comfortable 
 ProtagonistA had been living in the forest for a while , and it was starting to feel like home 
 ProtagonistA had made friends with the animals , and they would often help ProtagonistA find food and shelter 
 ProtagonistA was content in the forest , and did n't feel the need to wander anymore 
ProtagonistA had always been a doll 
 ProtagonistA was the perfect size , always impeccably dressed , and had a sweet face that never seemed to age 
 But when ProtagonistA turned six , ProtagonistA began to change 
 ProtagonistA grew taller and ProtagonistA's features became sharper 
 ProtagonistA was still beautiful , but in a frightening way 
 ProtagonistA did n't mind 
 ProtagonistA was happy to be the great doll ProtagonistA always knew ProtagonistA was 
 It was as if ProtagonistA had been transported to another world , one where ProtagonistA was the only inhabitant 
 ProtagonistA looked around , taking in the beauty of the place , when ProtagonistA heard a voice 
 ProtagonistA turned to see a beautiful white horse walking towards ProtagonistA 
 And so ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA followed the horse to a hill overlooking a valley 
 In the distance ProtagonistA could see a city , and the horse told ProtagonistA that was where ProtagonistA needed to go 
  But how will ProtagonistA get there ?  ProtagonistA asked 
ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way to the big horse show in town 
 ProtagonistA had been practicing hard and was excited to show off ProtagonistA's skills 
 As they approached the arena , ProtagonistA could see the other horses and riders getting ready 
 ProtagonistA felt a little nervous but was confident in ProtagonistA's abilities 
 When it was ProtagonistA's turn to enter the ring , ProtagonistA did so with a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA rode ProtagonistA's horse around the course , jumping over the fences and doing ProtagonistA best to show off ProtagonistA's skills 
 ProtagonistA had done it ! ProtagonistA had placed first in the horse show 
 ProtagonistA was so excited and proud of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and Shining Armor for their support and went off to celebrate ProtagonistA's victory 
ProtagonistA rested ProtagonistA's forelegs on ProtagonistA's knees , and let out a deep breath 
 ProtagonistA had been running for what felt like hours , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to tire 
 ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was or where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving 
 ProtagonistA had to find a way out of this place 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance 
 ProtagonistA quickly got to ProtagonistA's feet and started running again 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who or what was after ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't want to find out 
 ProtagonistA had to find a way out before they caught ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the field of our estate , looking at a photograph of ProtagonistB , with the utmost circumstance of safety 
 ProtagonistA had been waiting for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had first heard about ProtagonistB 
 Finally , ProtagonistA had been able to track ProtagonistB down , and ProtagonistA had been following ProtagonistB for days 
 ProtagonistA had been careful to keep ProtagonistA's distance , and to make sure that ProtagonistB never saw ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA had been able to get close enough to take a few photographs 
 And now ProtagonistA was sitting in the field , looking at one of those photographs 
 ProtagonistA could see the intelligence in ProtagonistB's eyes , and the strength in ProtagonistB's jaw 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would be able to help ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's own problems 
 ProtagonistA just had to find a way to get close to ProtagonistB , and to get ProtagonistB to trust ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked out over the moon 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately , and it felt good to just sit and appreciate the simple things in life 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and took a deep breath , letting the calmness wash over ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA looked over the map and saw more animals than ProtagonistA's own family 
 ProtagonistA looked out onto the world and saw a vast array of different creatures , each with their own unique features and habits 
 ProtagonistA was amazed at the variety of life on Earth and felt lucky to be a part of it 
ProtagonistA lived in a small town in northern Syria 
 ProtagonistA was the only child of ProtagonistA's parents , who were both farmers 
 ProtagonistA helped ProtagonistA's parents with their work , and ProtagonistA also attended school 
 As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to help ProtagonistA's parents more and more with the farm work 
 ProtagonistA also started to take on more responsibility for the community 
 ProtagonistA helped to organize the town 's food distribution , and ProtagonistA also helped to care for the town 's children 
 ProtagonistA continued to help ProtagonistA's parents with the farm work , and ProtagonistA also continued to help the community 
 ProtagonistA became the town 's leader , and ProtagonistA helped to keep the town running smoothly 
 ProtagonistA was now the only one who could take care of the farm and the town 
 ProtagonistA worked hard to keep everything going , but it was difficult 
 ProtagonistA continued to work hard , and ProtagonistA eventually managed to keep the farm and the town running smoothly 
 ProtagonistA was a good leader , and ProtagonistA was loved by ProtagonistA's people 
ProtagonistA had always been a go - getter 
 ProtagonistA was always the one to start new projects and see them through to the end 
 But , as ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA started to realize that ProtagonistA was always starting new projects but never finishing them 
 ProtagonistA would get bored or distracted and move on to something else before ProtagonistA could see the project through 
 ProtagonistA needed to find a project that ProtagonistA was passionate about and stick with it until the end 
 ProtagonistA found a cause that ProtagonistA cared deeply about and devoted ProtagonistA's time and energy to it 
 ProtagonistA became a leader in the movement and made a difference in the world 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the great grave , ignorant of all the history of the kingdom 
 ProtagonistA had no intention of ever going back 
 ProtagonistA did n't know why , but ProtagonistA trusted ProtagonistB 
 After a while , ProtagonistA got up and dusted ProtagonistA off 
 ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was in a graveyard 
 ProtagonistA saw the headstones and remembered ProtagonistB's words 
  ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was sitting on the grave of the Queen of Hearts 
ProtagonistA was so much more beautiful than I thought ProtagonistA was that ProtagonistA was going to kill me 
 ProtagonistA was always with ProtagonistA's friends and I was always with mine 
 ProtagonistA was always talking about how ProtagonistA was better than everyone else and how ProtagonistA deserved the best of everything 
ProtagonistA sat on the grass , ProtagonistA's wings spread , ProtagonistA's ears perked up as ProtagonistA listened to the rustle of leaves outside ProtagonistA's window 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let the warmth wash over ProtagonistA 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise that sounded like someone was coming 
 ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw a large rabbit walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so startled that ProtagonistA flew into the air 
 ProtagonistA was in a coma , lying in a hospital bed 
 ProtagonistA was weak , but ProtagonistA was alive 
 ProtagonistA tried to speak , but ProtagonistA's voice was hoarse 
 ProtagonistA love you ,  ProtagonistA croaked 
 ProtagonistA was alive , and ProtagonistA was going to be okay 
 ProtagonistA asked me to come in , and I did so 
 ProtagonistA introduced me to ProtagonistA's friends , and they all shook hands with me 
 As a result , ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner 
 ProtagonistA was content to spend ProtagonistA's days reading books and exploring the woods around ProtagonistA's house 
 When ProtagonistA's parents died , ProtagonistA was the only one left and ProtagonistA had no desire to keep up the old place 
 So , ProtagonistA sold it and moved away 
 ProtagonistA sometimes drives by the house now and ProtagonistA ca n't help but feel a sense of pride and happiness when ProtagonistA sees it 
ProtagonistA had been a human being , and a man , and had been of every human class and race 
 ProtagonistA had been of one kind of body or another , and had possessed more or less of two or three kinds of intelligence 
 However , ProtagonistA had been the object of abhorrent or even loathsome detestable treatment , and had been either tortured or executed for the crime of attempting to escape from the jurisdiction of any superior authority 
 ProtagonistA had been unwilling either to help ProtagonistA's persecutors or to defend ProtagonistA , and had been willing to do anything to prevent ProtagonistA's persecutors from killing or setting out to kill ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had believed ProtagonistA to be innocent , and no less a judge or magistrate than a criminal had charged ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the edge of a tarpaulin in a crowded room with the windows down when the voice whispered in ProtagonistA's ear 
 ProtagonistA 're going to be a great success 
 ProtagonistA turned to see who had spoken , but there was no one there 
 ProtagonistA turned back to the tarpaulin and continued to sit there , wondering what the voice had meant 
 A few weeks later , ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's office when ProtagonistA received a call from a friend 
 ProtagonistA 're going to be a great success 
 ProtagonistA was surprised , but pleased , to hear this 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistA's friend and hung up the phone , feeling more confident than ever before 
 Since that day , ProtagonistA has gone on to achieve great things 
 ProtagonistA attributes ProtagonistA's success to the voice that whispered in ProtagonistA's ear all those years ago 
ProtagonistA was born as the son of a salaried workman in the midst of a profusion of pre - war industries of industrial importance , and who , having hung on throughout a highly successful career , has made ProtagonistA's fortune by , and in fact made ProtagonistA's fortune quite a while ago , by the methods which ProtagonistA has adopted to capitalize upon ProtagonistA's great fortune , although of late the conflict of interest which ProtagonistB enjoyed , in procuring a certain amount of capital , has become a serious matter ProtagonistA was always a bright child , and ProtagonistA quickly learned how to capitalize on ProtagonistA's strengths 
 ProtagonistA was very good at making friends and networking , and ProtagonistA quickly learned how to use ProtagonistA's charms to get what ProtagonistA wanted 
 ProtagonistA was also very good at making money , and ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA could use ProtagonistA's money to get ahead in life 
 ProtagonistA is now a very successful woman , and ProtagonistA has made a fortune by using ProtagonistA's unique talents 
There was ProtagonistA in the full light of the morning , and ProtagonistA was very tired 
 ProtagonistA had been up all night , trying to finish ProtagonistA's homework , and ProtagonistA was just about to give up and go to bed when ProtagonistA heard a noise outside 
 ProtagonistA went to the window and saw ProtagonistB sitting on the curb , crying ProtagonistB's eyes out 
 ProtagonistA felt bad for ProtagonistB , so ProtagonistA went outside to see if ProtagonistA could help 
 When ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistB was crying because ProtagonistB had lost ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistC's name was , and ProtagonistB said it was Mr
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistB did 
 Just when they were about to give up , ProtagonistA heard a meow coming from a tree 
 ProtagonistA climbed up the tree , and there was ProtagonistC , stuck in a branch 
 ProtagonistA got ProtagonistC down , and ProtagonistB was so happy to have ProtagonistC back 
 ProtagonistA went back inside , and ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA had helped ProtagonistB 
 It made ProtagonistA feel good to know that ProtagonistA had made someone 's day a little bit better 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was the only unicorn in the world 
 ProtagonistA was wrong 
 ProtagonistA was different 
 ProtagonistA was special 
 ProtagonistA was the only one who could see the magic in the world 
 When ProtagonistA found out about the others , ProtagonistA was scared at first 
 But then ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was not alone 
 ProtagonistA had a community of unicorns who loved and accepted ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had never known that ProtagonistB did n't like ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had always thought that ProtagonistB was just a grumpy old man who did n't want to be bothered with ProtagonistA 
 But one day , ProtagonistA overheard ProtagonistB talking to ProtagonistA's mother 
  After that , ProtagonistA tried to be a better daughter , but ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was being compared to ProtagonistA's siblings and found wanting 
ProtagonistA had always been a bright girl , but something had been off lately 
 So , when ProtagonistA had the opportunity to kill ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA took it 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to live anymore 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden , surrounded by friendly creatures 
 ProtagonistA had never felt so alive before 
 ProtagonistA decided to live for ProtagonistA from then on and ProtagonistA was never happier 
ProtagonistA had heard the talk of a great city , but ProtagonistA had never seen any of it 
 ProtagonistA had always lived in the country , and it was all ProtagonistA had ever known 
 But one day , ProtagonistA decided to take a trip into the city 
 ProtagonistA was amazed by all of the sights and sounds 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it 
 ProtagonistA walked the streets for hours , taking it all in 
 ProtagonistA even got to see the city at night , when it was all lit up 
 It was an experience ProtagonistA would never forget 
ProtagonistA was driving to work when ProtagonistA was hit by another car 
 When ProtagonistA finally woke up , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been in an accident 
 ProtagonistA was grateful to be alive but was also angry that ProtagonistA had been in an accident 
 ProtagonistA was determined to make the most of ProtagonistA's life from that day forward 
 It was a big party , and ProtagonistA was excited to go 
 ProtagonistA had never been to a party before , and ProtagonistA was curious about what would happen 
 ProtagonistA was a little bit nervous , but ProtagonistA was also excited 
 At the party , ProtagonistA met a lot of new people 
 ProtagonistA danced , ProtagonistA laughed , and ProtagonistA had a great time 
 ProtagonistA was surprised at how much fun ProtagonistA had , and ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had gone to the party 
 This time , ProtagonistA was a little bit more experienced , and ProtagonistA knew what to expect 
 ProtagonistA had a great time , and ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had gone 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a recluse , preferring to stay in ProtagonistA's workshop tinkering with ProtagonistA's latest invention rather than spend time with ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA had been cheating on ProtagonistC with ProtagonistC's best friend 
 ProtagonistA's only response was that ProtagonistA was  in love  with ProtagonistB's friend 
 As far as ProtagonistB was concerned , ProtagonistA was dead to ProtagonistB 
 But now , ProtagonistA was back , and ProtagonistA was facing the thing that had killed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't stand a chance 
ProtagonistA had been taking the ferry down the winding stone steps into the harbor for years 
 ProtagonistA had never missed a day 
 ProtagonistA could n't seem to get up 
  ProtagonistA tried to stand , but ProtagonistA's legs would n't work 
  ProtagonistA 've never been late before 
  ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA had been feeling tired lately , but ProtagonistA thought it was just because ProtagonistA was getting old 
 Now ProtagonistA was n't so sure 
ProtagonistA watched in horror as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB die 
 ProtagonistA had seen death before , but never like this 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could n't just stand by and watch 
 ProtagonistA had to do something 
ProtagonistA was a man of the people , and at the time that ProtagonistA was travelling so very far , that ProtagonistA was not aware of its importance 
 ProtagonistA was on a journey to find ProtagonistA , and in doing so , ProtagonistA found something much greater 
 ProtagonistA found a purpose 
 Along the way , ProtagonistA made many friends and helped many people 
 ProtagonistA was a light in their lives , and they were a light in ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA showed them that it was possible to be happy and to live a good life , no matter what their circumstances were 
 ProtagonistA has been a prisoner for so long that the outside world has become a distant memory 
 The guards leave ProtagonistA's cell unlocked and ProtagonistA takes ProtagonistA's opportunity to run 
 ProtagonistA does n't know where ProtagonistA is going , but ProtagonistA does n't care 
 All that matters is that ProtagonistA is free 
 ProtagonistA looks down at the infinite void below and knows that there is no turning back now 
 ProtagonistA takes a deep breath and jumps 
 For a moment ProtagonistA feels weightless , free from all ProtagonistA's troubles 
 But then ProtagonistA starts to fall and the reality of ProtagonistA's situation sets in 
 ProtagonistA screams as ProtagonistA plummets into the darkness , knowing that ProtagonistA will never escape the Disc of the Dead 
ProtagonistA was never one for following the rules 
 ProtagonistA was always pushing boundaries and testing limits 
 By the time ProtagonistA reached ProtagonistA's limits , ProtagonistA was an ordinary young man -- not quite fourteen , but in the right sort of body 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider and did n't quite fit in with the other girls ProtagonistA's age 
 ProtagonistA was always pushing ProtagonistA to try new things and experience as much as ProtagonistA could 
 And ProtagonistA loved every minute of it 
 Even though ProtagonistA was now a young man , ProtagonistA still did n't feel like ProtagonistA fit in anywhere 
 But ProtagonistA was content with who ProtagonistA was and did n't want to change a thing 
 ProtagonistA was happy living life on ProtagonistA's own terms and would n't have it any other way 
In the year 1838 , ProtagonistA published ProtagonistA's scientific treatise , entitled Energetic Forces and Energy , in which ProtagonistA distinguishes between the forms of energy , invisible to the senses , and those which have a definite object , the third and highest form of Energy 
 ProtagonistA argues that the highest form of energy is that which is used to create and maintain life , and that this energy is best harnessed through the use of reason and scientific knowledge 
ProtagonistA had been married for years , but ProtagonistA still felt like a newlywed 
 ProtagonistA loved spending time with ProtagonistA's wife , even if it was just doing mundane tasks like picking up the newspaper 
 After ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's wife alone in the garden , ProtagonistA went to pick up the newspaper and dipped it into ProtagonistA's cupboard , wishing ProtagonistA had a camera and a memory of where ProtagonistA had put it the week before 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget the moments ProtagonistA shared with ProtagonistA's wife , even if ProtagonistA could n't always remember where ProtagonistA left the newspaper 
ProtagonistA usually sat at ProtagonistA's desk and wrote in a notebook 
 ProtagonistA was a writer and loved to write stories 
 Today , ProtagonistA was working on a new story about a girl who lived in a magical kingdom 
 ProtagonistA was just about to write the part where the girl found the treasure , when ProtagonistA heard a noise outside ProtagonistA's window 
 ProtagonistA got up to see what it was and saw a bird flying by 
 ProtagonistA watched the bird for a few minutes before going back to ProtagonistA's story 
 ProtagonistA had led ProtagonistB to a strange place 
 ProtagonistA was sitting on a large mushroom , eating a carrot 
 ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistA just continued to eat ProtagonistA's carrot 
 ProtagonistA , please ,  ProtagonistB begged 
 Again , ProtagonistA said nothing 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and motioned for ProtagonistB to go inside 
 ProtagonistA , feeling a sudden warmth in ProtagonistA's cheeks , turned ProtagonistA's head away from the Equestrians 
 ProtagonistA caught the eye of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA watched , entranced , as they moved around the room , their bodies graceful and powerful 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt a hand on ProtagonistA's shoulder , and ProtagonistA was being pulled to ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistA looked up into the eyes of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream as ProtagonistA was swept up in the music and the movement 
 ProtagonistA was furious when ProtagonistA found out 
 ProtagonistA felt that ProtagonistA's rights had been violated and that the act was unjust 
 ProtagonistA started a petition and gathered signatures from all over the country 
 ProtagonistA went to the House of Lords and made ProtagonistA's case 
 ProtagonistA was eloquent and persuasive , and the Lords listened 
 ProtagonistA was triumphant and vindicated 
 ProtagonistA had shown that ProtagonistA was not to be pushed around or denied ProtagonistA's rights 
 ProtagonistA was a force to be reckoned with , and ProtagonistA would never give up fighting for what was rightfully ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was walking home from ProtagonistA's friend 's house when ProtagonistA was jumped from behind 
 ProtagonistA felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's throat and then ProtagonistA's vision started to fade 
 As ProtagonistA lay on the ground , ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistA's attacker standing over ProtagonistA , knife in hand 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die 
  ProtagonistB , can ProtagonistA walk the rest of the way by ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 So ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's backpack and continued on to school by ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was cold , but ProtagonistA felt good walking on ProtagonistA's own 
ProtagonistA had been a church member for years , but ProtagonistA had never really felt connected to ProtagonistA's fellow parishioners 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistA had a conversation with one of ProtagonistA's fellow church members that changed everything 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to hear this , and it made ProtagonistA feel good 
 For the first time , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA belonged 
 ProtagonistA started to feel more connected to ProtagonistA's church community and to the people ProtagonistA was helping 
 ProtagonistA had been forgetting or ignoring the fact that ProtagonistA was part of something larger than ProtagonistA 
 But now ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA's work was important , and that ProtagonistA was making a difference 
ProtagonistA was staring up at the sky , ProtagonistA's eyes wide in wonder 
 ProtagonistA was the breadwinner and the glue that held the family together 
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA saw a light up ahead 
 ProtagonistA walked towards it and saw that it was a lamp on a small table 
 ProtagonistA picked it up and looked around 
 ProtagonistA saw a door in the tree and a key on the table 
 ProtagonistA put the key in the door and turned it 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden 
 ProtagonistA blinked widely , as though ProtagonistA were trying to find the light 
 ProtagonistA walked around the garden and saw a castle in the distance 
 ProtagonistA started to walk towards it , but ProtagonistA was suddenly pulled back 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB standing there 
  Who are ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked 
ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was afraid of ghosts 
 ProtagonistA had seen too many movies where the protagonist is haunted by a ghost and ProtagonistA did n't want that to be ProtagonistA's fate 
 However , one day , ProtagonistA saw a ghost in ProtagonistA's house 
 At first , ProtagonistA was scared 
 But then ProtagonistA realized that the ghost was just a figment of ProtagonistA's imagination and ProtagonistA was n't really scared anymore 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who lived in a small town 
 ProtagonistA was a simple girl who worked hard and did n't have much 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the woods when ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was now able to make deals with anyone ProtagonistA wanted 
 ProtagonistA quickly became the most powerful person in the world 
ProtagonistA was walking home from the back of the church , where ProtagonistA had been having a rough passage due to ProtagonistA , and which was in ProtagonistA's own shoes , with ProtagonistA's hat on 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about the events of the day and how ProtagonistA could have handled them better 
 ProtagonistA was also thinking about the future and what ProtagonistA wanted to do with ProtagonistA's life 
 As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB walking in front of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA wondered what ProtagonistB did for a living 
 ProtagonistA also wondered if ProtagonistB had ever had a rough passage in ProtagonistB's life 
 ProtagonistA could make any dress look beautiful , no matter how simple it was 
 ProtagonistA was also a very compassionate person 
 ProtagonistA was always helping others , whether it was making them a new dress or just lending a listening ear 
 ProtagonistA was always there for me when I needed ProtagonistA , and I will never forget ProtagonistA's kindness 
 Sadly , ProtagonistA passed away last year 
ProtagonistA had been aboard the Carol when it collided with the moor 
 ProtagonistA saw a large ship covered in splinters and thought it possible the corpse of a man might have come aboard 
 The night after ProtagonistB's death , ProtagonistA spent the night in a hospital room with a needle in ProtagonistA's arm and a tube in ProtagonistA's leg 
 In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing in a field of flowers 
 ProtagonistA woke up from ProtagonistA's dream feeling comforted and hopeful 
 Even though ProtagonistB was gone , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was still with ProtagonistB in spirit 
ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA back on the landscape and ProtagonistB said ,  That 's it , then 
 ProtagonistA 's free , though ProtagonistA doubts it 
 ProtagonistA was at a party once 
 ProtagonistA sighed and shook ProtagonistA's head 
  ProtagonistA do n't know , ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 're not giving up on anything 
 ProtagonistA 're just moving on to the next phase of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA 've been talking about it for months now 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was right , but ProtagonistA still could n't help but feel a little sad as ProtagonistA turned away from ProtagonistA's home of the last ten years 
 ProtagonistA had loved living in the city , but it was time for a change 
 And ProtagonistA was ready for the next adventure 
ProtagonistA had always been good at cards 
 ProtagonistA could remember back to when ProtagonistA was a little girl , sitting at the kitchen table with ProtagonistA's mother and father , playing Go Fish and War 
 ProtagonistA had always had a knack for reading people and knowing what cards they were holding 
 As ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA could use ProtagonistA's skills to make money 
 So , some time in the latter half of the eighteenth century , ProtagonistA set out to steal the title of Ruben de Vros , notwithstanding the great advantages which ProtagonistA had acquired by ProtagonistA's skill in the art of card - playing 
 ProtagonistA went to the best casinos in Europe and cleaned them out , one by one 
 But ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA was on a roll and nothing was going to stop ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA started playing in underground games , where the stakes were higher and the players were more desperate 
 ProtagonistA won more money than ProtagonistA knew what to do with and rubbed elbows with the criminal underworld 
 One night , ProtagonistA was playing in a high - stakes game with some of the most dangerous people in the world 
 Desperate and broke , ProtagonistA made a deal with ProtagonistB to give ProtagonistB information on other card players in exchange for money 
 ProtagonistA became a professional gambler and a con artist , using ProtagonistA's skills to take advantage of other people 
 ProtagonistA ruined lives and ruined ProtagonistA in the process 
At least Alice was n't going to eat them , said ProtagonistA — fully aware that ProtagonistA was packing a bag full of the pastries in case ProtagonistA ran into an unusual custom in the future , and in anticipation of Croaking to find a new friend to eat with 
 Even so , ProtagonistA could not help but be curious about the Croaking , and was excited to see what would happen 
ProtagonistA had been on the City - Ship for as long as ProtagonistA could remember 
 But now , ProtagonistA was stepping out into the unknown 
 But ProtagonistA was n't 
 ProtagonistA was stepping out into the world for the first time 
 And ProtagonistA was scared 
 But ProtagonistA was also excited 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what was out there , but ProtagonistA was ready to find out 
ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately 
 First , ProtagonistA had gotten sick and had to be hospitalized 
 Finally , ProtagonistA was starting to feel better and was able to go outside again 
 However , on the ninth day , ProtagonistA began to feel worse again 
 ProtagonistA had a fever and felt very weak 
 ProtagonistA began to worry that ProtagonistA would never get better 
 By the eleventh day , ProtagonistA was feeling almost back to normal 
 Finally , on the twelfth day , ProtagonistA was feeling completely better 
 ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had finally recovered and that ProtagonistA could go back to ProtagonistA's normal life 
ProtagonistA , sitting crosslegged on a damp stone floor , had a cigarette lighter in each hand , and a bundle of twigs in front of ProtagonistA , containing nothing but a wide - brimmed hat and a pair of straw gloves 
 ProtagonistA was trying to light a fire , but the dampness of the twigs made it difficult 
 ProtagonistA had been at it for hours , and ProtagonistA's fingers were getting sore from holding the lighters 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw a spark catch on one of the twigs 
 ProtagonistA quickly cupped ProtagonistA's hands around it to shelter it from the damp air , and soon a small fire was burning 
 ProtagonistA added some of the larger twigs to the fire , and then sat back to warm ProtagonistA's hands 
 ProtagonistA was so focused on the fire that ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching until they were right behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistB standing there , watching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how long ProtagonistB had been there , but ProtagonistA did n't feel scared 
Deep within a blue - green void , ProtagonistA was very proud of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was like a proud and very happy man , very pleased with himself 
 In the same way as a proud and very happy man is very happy with himself , ProtagonistA was very proud of ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was out on a hunt one day when ProtagonistA came across a valley 
 In the valley , ProtagonistA found the body of a strange little pony who had been snatched from ProtagonistA by a couple of rude villagers 
 ProtagonistA felt sorry for the pony , and ProtagonistA decided to take it back to ProtagonistA's home 
ProtagonistA was a man of genius , even when ProtagonistA was young , and one who carried on ProtagonistA's mind without restraint the deep doctrine of national devotion which was then in fashion 
 ProtagonistA longed to do something to make ProtagonistA's country proud , and when the opportunity came , ProtagonistA seized it with both hands 
 ProtagonistA became a soldier , and fought with distinction in the war against the French 
 ProtagonistA was the talk of the town , and ProtagonistA's picture was in all the newspapers 
 But ProtagonistA was not content with being a hero 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be more than that 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be a great leader , and so ProtagonistA entered politics 
 ProtagonistA quickly rose to the top , and became one of the most respected and influential politicians in the country 
 ProtagonistA was a woman of genius , and ProtagonistA used ProtagonistA's talents to make ProtagonistA's country great 
 ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB , and they went on the most amazing honeymoon 
ProtagonistA may be in the third year of ProtagonistA's best and brightest year , but ProtagonistA 's not going anywhere 
 ProtagonistA knows that there 's nothing better than being surrounded by the people ProtagonistA loves 
ProtagonistA had also been hoping that ProtagonistA had died in an airplane accident 
 ProtagonistA was tired of ProtagonistA's life and felt like ProtagonistA had nothing to live for 
 ProtagonistA had been planning to take a flight from Los Angeles to New York , and ProtagonistA was hoping that the plane would crash 
 ProtagonistA was hoping that ProtagonistA would die in a fiery explosion and that ProtagonistA's body would be so badly burned that ProtagonistA's family would not be able to recognize ProtagonistA 
When ProtagonistA was thirteen years old , ProtagonistA dated ProtagonistA's first book , In a Sentence or an Exposition , for something like three months , noting the date , and so casting some doubt 
In the year of our Lord 2001 , ProtagonistA was sitting in the chair , with ProtagonistA's hat on the mantelpiece , and ProtagonistB next to ProtagonistA , which was a very strange arrangement 
 What are ProtagonistB looking at ?  ProtagonistA asked 
  ProtagonistA 're a very strange woman 
 And ProtagonistB 're a very strange man ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 're in a lot of trouble 
 What kind of trouble ?  ProtagonistA asked 
  ProtagonistA need to leave this place 
 Why ?  ProtagonistA asked 
  But ProtagonistA need to trust ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA need to come with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment 
 ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA could trust ProtagonistB 
 But then ProtagonistA thought about all the trouble ProtagonistA was in 
 ProtagonistA was in danger 
 ProtagonistA needed to leave 
 ProtagonistA stood up and followed ProtagonistB out of the house 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what was going to happen , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to trust ProtagonistB 
 You're going to be lonely ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA was a remarkable woman 
 ProtagonistA was so devoted to the city and its people that ProtagonistA was astonished by the extent of the public debt when ProtagonistA left 
 ProtagonistA collected a large sum of money from the public before ProtagonistA was forced to admit ProtagonistA's own helplessness and to focus ProtagonistA's energies on the pressing business of default during some years of King Henry I 's reign 
 ProtagonistA was not a very good man , but ProtagonistA was not stupid either 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to find a way out of the room 
 ProtagonistA looked around and saw a small window high up on the wall 
 ProtagonistA also saw a chair in the corner of the room 
 ProtagonistA went to the window and tried to reach it , but ProtagonistA could not 
 ProtagonistA then went to the chair and stood on it 
 ProtagonistA was able to reach the window and unlock it 
 ProtagonistA climbed out of the window and escaped 
ProtagonistA was a paralegal at a small law firm and ProtagonistA was given a file to examine 
 ProtagonistA looked through the file and found a bank statement from a hidden bank account 
 ProtagonistA also found a document showing that the husband had purchased a life insurance policy with his wife as the beneficiary 
 ProtagonistA brought these findings to ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB was able to use them to get a better settlement for the wife 
ProtagonistA was old enough to buy a horse and carriage , and had the least money in the world , ProtagonistA had the honor of buying one of what was then called the ' Baron 's Money - House ' in the street of St
 Mary 's , where ProtagonistA now lives in a flat and furnished house , with a garden and a verandah , but in which there are scarcely twenty - five persons in the whole of it ; and ProtagonistA has lived , as ProtagonistA told it in the story , for ever and ever , without having any friends or any personal possessions of any sort ; not even the slightest money , and when ProtagonistA speaks of ProtagonistA's possessions it is in the sense of plenty of things ; but ProtagonistA has never been in want of anything , or of anything of any importance , in the whole world , or in ProtagonistA's whole lifetime ; and ProtagonistA certainly never has been in any very ill - fortune ; and yet ProtagonistA has been in many indeed fortunate and fortunate circumstances and has been in many fortunes of all kinds and all kinds ; and though ProtagonistA has never been in any financial difficulty , and if ProtagonistA had any doubt of that , ProtagonistA would have no doubt of it now , ProtagonistA has never been in a position of great or great inconvenience or difficulty ; and yet there have been times when ProtagonistA thought it all over , and when ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA was so poor and so wretched that ProtagonistA could not possibly have amassed so much wealth in ProtagonistA's lifetime ; and ProtagonistA had thought that ProtagonistA was much richer than ProtagonistA really was ; but there has never been any way of testing this , nor any way of having any thing like determination in the matter , which , if it had been possible , ProtagonistA would not have known how to work out for ProtagonistA ; and although ProtagonistA had long been in disuse , ProtagonistA had never had any taste for anything beyond the ordinary necessities of life ; and though , for long years ProtagonistA had been content as regards material things , the happy result had been , no doubt , that ProtagonistA had been at no loss for a career lasting an indefinite number of years , during which ProtagonistA had not failed in obtaining a livelihood whose success ProtagonistA had long known , or rather had been absolutely certain of , and had ever been fully conscious of ; and though for many years after ProtagonistA had ceased to be in want of any sort of material comforts , and even for a livelihood of a very temporal character , or of material comfort , within the smaller limits of the earth ; and though perhaps there had been times when ProtagonistA had been in some circumstances in which ProtagonistA had been doing better than ProtagonistA truly was ; at any rate , ProtagonistA had been in every respect in which ProtagonistA might have been expected to perform , in all probability at most one thousandth part of what ProtagonistA had performed , and ProtagonistA had been as perfectly consistent and as industrious as any other person in the world ; not merely in ProtagonistA's own mind , but also in the whole body of ProtagonistA's society ; and this proved that ProtagonistA had never been in any sort of distress 
ProtagonistA is a man who leads a simple life 
 That is , ProtagonistA does not depend on fortune or gifts of nature for happiness 
 ProtagonistA is content with what ProtagonistA has and does not seek more than ProtagonistA needs 
 ProtagonistA is a kind and good person , always helping others when ProtagonistA can 
 ProtagonistA is happy with ProtagonistA's lot in life 
As ProtagonistA stood at ProtagonistA's office door , waiting to be summoned , ProtagonistA noticed that the door was open 
 ProtagonistA peered inside and saw ProtagonistB , sitting at ProtagonistB's desk 
 ProtagonistA was about to knock on the door when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB speaking on the phone 
  ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart sink as ProtagonistA heard the words 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had been with the company for a long time and that ProtagonistA was a good worker 
 ProtagonistA did n't deserve to be treated like this 
 ProtagonistA was about to turn and leave when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB say ,  ProtagonistA , come in 
  ProtagonistA walked into the office and sat down in the chair across from ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's eyes fill with tears as ProtagonistA heard the words 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do 
 ProtagonistA had been with the company for five years and this was the first time ProtagonistA had ever been let go from a job 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to support ProtagonistA's family 
ProtagonistA had the gall to tell us that ProtagonistA had made an incursion into the kingdom of Henry the Second , and that ProtagonistA had been interested , though ProtagonistA had not been interested in the slightest degree 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had been to the castle of Windsor , and had seen the king and queen , and that they were very kind to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA told us that ProtagonistA had been to the palace of Westminster , and had seen the king 's chamber , and the queen 's chamber , and that they were very beautiful 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had been to the Tower of London , and had seen the king 's jewels , and that they were very fine 
 ProtagonistA told us that ProtagonistA had been to the Abbey of St
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had been to the city of London , and had seen the king 's palace , and the queen 's palace , and that they were very magnificent 
There was no doubt in either the mind of the spectator or the mind of the scientist or the ear of either that ProtagonistA was right when ProtagonistA said that a planet orbits a sun 
ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way through the city , noticing the strange looks ProtagonistA got from the people around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew they were wondering why ProtagonistA was there , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to make a good impression 
 ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way to ProtagonistB's office , and ProtagonistA made a noticeable effort to be friendly , although ProtagonistA knew well enough from ProtagonistA's long experience in the city that the term seemed more than a little strange to ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA need a runner ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and took the list 
ProtagonistA was a simple woman who lived a simple life 
 ProtagonistA had no great ambitions or desires for wealth or power 
 All ProtagonistA wanted was to be happy and to help others find happiness 
 ProtagonistA was a kind and compassionate person , always lending a helping hand to those in need 
 Despite ProtagonistA's lack of material possessions , ProtagonistA was one of the richest people in the world because ProtagonistA had a heart full of love 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's living room , reading a book , when ProtagonistA got a call from ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB and wished ProtagonistB all the best 
ProtagonistA was always in the kitchen , but ProtagonistA was never out of coffee 
 ProtagonistA was always brewing a pot or two , and ProtagonistA always had a cup ready for anyone who wanted one 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's coffee , and ProtagonistA loved being in the kitchen 
ProtagonistA was a bright young girl , always tinkering with something new 
 When ProtagonistA was twelve years old , ProtagonistA invented the flotilla technique , a way to move a boat using only the power of the wind 
 ProtagonistA was always testing it out on the pond near ProtagonistA's home , and it quickly became ProtagonistA's favorite pastime 
 ProtagonistA was terrified , but ProtagonistA did n't give up 
 Using ProtagonistA's flotilla technique , ProtagonistA was able to make it to shore safely 
 Since that day , ProtagonistA has been perfecting ProtagonistA's invention 
 ProtagonistA 's now a world - renowned scientist , and ProtagonistA 's still only twelve years old 
ProtagonistA was hunting down a rabbit when ProtagonistA heard the awful noise of the gunfight 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , ProtagonistA just wanted to get away from the noise 
 ProtagonistA ran for what felt like hours until ProtagonistA finally came to a stop 
 ProtagonistA leaned against a tree to catch ProtagonistA's breath and that 's when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die 
ProtagonistA had been living in ProtagonistA's apartment by the river for a few months when ProtagonistA began to have nightmares 
 ProtagonistA would wake up in a cold sweat , ProtagonistA's heart racing 
 One morning , ProtagonistA woke up from a particularly bad nightmare and ran to the door , intending to flee the apartment 
 However , when ProtagonistA got to the door , ProtagonistA found that it was locked 
 ProtagonistA tried to turn the knob , but it would n't budge 
 ProtagonistA pounded on the door , screaming for help , but no one came 
 ProtagonistB was happy that ProtagonistA was making friends and that ProtagonistA was including ProtagonistC in ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA had dropped into the school , not knowing why ProtagonistA was there ; it was as though ProtagonistA 'd been dropped into the middle of nowhere 
 ProtagonistA looked around , confused , until ProtagonistA saw a sign that said  Welcome to Nowhere High School !  ProtagonistA laughed , relieved , and walked inside 
ProtagonistA had been walking very slow all morning , reaching ProtagonistA's destination in the town of Trafalgar , about eight miles south of Manchester 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , ever since ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's home in Liverpool 
 ProtagonistA was tired , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore , but ProtagonistA kept walking 
 ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had heard that ProtagonistB was living in Trafalgar , and ProtagonistA was determined to find ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA walked up and down the streets , asking people if they had seen ProtagonistB , but no one had 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC walking towards ProtagonistA 
 Hello ,  ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA 'm looking for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistB 
When ProtagonistA was sixteen , ProtagonistA was sitting alone in ProtagonistA's room , thinking of ProtagonistA's future after the war 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a doctor , but now ProtagonistA was n't so sure 
 ProtagonistA had seen so much death and destruction during the war , and ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA could handle it anymore 
 ProtagonistA was also thinking about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistB was alive or dead , and ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA could handle the thought of losing ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was young and beautiful , and ProtagonistB could see the promise of a great reign ahead 
 ProtagonistA appreciated ProtagonistB's loyalty , and they became friends 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm sorry to say this , but ProtagonistA 've overshot ProtagonistA's task 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB wanted ProtagonistA to do a good job 
  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA said as ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's things and left 
ProtagonistA's eyeball was still open and ProtagonistA's gaze was wandering , but ProtagonistA was sure there was something under the surface of the water 
 ProtagonistA had been swimming for what felt like hours , and ProtagonistA's arms and legs were starting to feel heavy 
 ProtagonistA was just about to give up and turn back when ProtagonistA saw a flash of something white out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye 
 ProtagonistA swam towards it , and when ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA saw that it was a fish 
 ProtagonistA was about to turn back when ProtagonistA saw another fish , and then another 
 ProtagonistA forgot all about ProtagonistA's tired arms and legs and swam after them 
 ProtagonistA managed to catch a few , and when ProtagonistA got back to shore , ProtagonistA was exhausted but happy 
 ProtagonistA had nothing left but the clothes on ProtagonistA's back and the ashes of ProtagonistA's past 
 ProtagonistA had nowhere to go and no one to turn to 
 ProtagonistA was completely alone in the world 
 But ProtagonistA was a survivor 
 ProtagonistA had been through worse before and ProtagonistA would get through this 
 ProtagonistA would find a way to rebuild ProtagonistA's life and make a new home for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA would not let the fire defeat ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been howling for hours 
 ProtagonistA had been howling ever since ProtagonistA saw the rat in ProtagonistA's house 
 And now , ProtagonistA was howling 
 ProtagonistA had been howling for hours 
 But ProtagonistA just kept howling 
 ProtagonistA howled and howled and howled 
 ProtagonistA was there for years 
 And ProtagonistA never stopped howling 
ProtagonistA should have known that ProtagonistB was a total loser 
 ProtagonistA was such a fool in the beginning , when ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB was a catch 
 ProtagonistA should have known better when ProtagonistB started hitting ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA stayed with ProtagonistB , because ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB 
 One day , ProtagonistA came home and found ProtagonistB in bed with another woman 
 ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and left , never to look back 
 ProtagonistA should have known better from the beginning 
 ProtagonistA had a suitcase in one hand and a bag in the other 
 When ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA smiled 
ProtagonistA was ten years old , and ProtagonistA could tell by a glance that the kids who went to school in the little green hall were pretty active 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would have to be careful around them , and that it would be best to stay out of their way 
 However , ProtagonistA also knew that if ProtagonistA could just keep ProtagonistA's head down and stay out of trouble , ProtagonistA would be able to make it through the school year without any problems 
 ProtagonistA was a very average looking girl , with brown hair and blue eyes 
 ProtagonistA was never really popular in school , but ProtagonistA was always friendly and nice to everyone 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to change ProtagonistA's name to something more unique 
 ProtagonistA chose the name John , after ProtagonistA's favorite author 
 ProtagonistA started to write stories under ProtagonistA's new name , and soon became quite popular 
 ProtagonistA was finally happy with who ProtagonistA was , and ProtagonistA's new name 
A young man , a man of twenty four , ProtagonistA had the name of ProtagonistB , but for all that ProtagonistA was not a very good liar 
 But ProtagonistA had to try 
 ProtagonistA had no money to pay for the food ProtagonistA had taken , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would be in big trouble if ProtagonistA was caught 
 ProtagonistA was desperate , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be able to help ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB knew something was up 
 However , when the police came to arrest ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB was the one who told them where ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA was shocked , and ProtagonistA could n't believe that ProtagonistB had betrayed ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was happy living ProtagonistA's life by ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't need anyone else and was content with ProtagonistA's own company 
 However , one day ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistB and finally felt like ProtagonistA belonged somewhere 
Once upon a time , when the world was young , ProtagonistA was walking home one cold Thursday evening in August , and ProtagonistA came upon a little stone church on a green and flowery street , or in better letters Rickson , on the south side of ProtagonistB , in which the main thoroughfares led down to the narrow streets and galleries of the lower part of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA hesitated a moment , then lifted the latch and went in 
 When the service was over , ProtagonistA went up to ProtagonistC to introduce ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistC 'm glad ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's way to our little church 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistC and said ProtagonistA would 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would be back 
 ProtagonistA was always dreaming of ProtagonistA's wedding day and what it would be like 
 ProtagonistA had planned everything out perfectly in ProtagonistA's head , but ProtagonistA never thought that it would actually happen 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the park and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and they began talking 
ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was going to steal my twin sisters , but I thought ProtagonistA was joking 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who loved to explore 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole and decided to follow it 
 ProtagonistA ended up in ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had many adventures in ProtagonistB and made many new friends 
 ProtagonistA even met a talking rabbit ! ProtagonistA eventually found ProtagonistA's way back home , but ProtagonistA always remembered ProtagonistA's adventures in ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who lived in a time when the world was very different 
 However , ProtagonistA was not content with simply being a princess 
 ProtagonistA wanted to make a difference in the world 
 ProtagonistA was very interested in history and ProtagonistA loved to learn about what had happened in the past 
 ProtagonistA was always asking questions and trying to understand why things had happened the way they did 
 ProtagonistA was particularly interested in the lives of famous women in history 
 One day , ProtagonistA had a very strange dream 
 In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful palace in heaven 
 ProtagonistA realised that ProtagonistA recognised some of the women 
 They were famous women from history ! ProtagonistA was amazed to see them all there together in heaven 
 ProtagonistA can well remember what events have taken place in history 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe that ProtagonistA was being spoken to by a woman from history 
 ProtagonistA was even more amazed when the woman told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was going to be given a very special gift 
 ProtagonistA will be able to remember everything that ProtagonistA have ever read about history 
 ProtagonistA could n't wait to start using ProtagonistA's new gift 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would be able to learn so much more about the world and its history 
ProtagonistA and Flutterbottom first met at a party 
 ProtagonistA had no idea who they were , but they hit it off immediately 
ProtagonistA rose from among the ruins of the great forest , and at first sight , ProtagonistA appeared to be nothing more than a helpless , ragged visitor 
 However , upon closer inspection , it was clear that ProtagonistA was far from helpless 
 ProtagonistA had been living in the forest for years , ever since ProtagonistA's family had been killed in a fire 
 Over the years , ProtagonistA had made a home for ProtagonistA among the ruins of the forest , and had even managed to find some valuable treasures among the debris 
 Now , as ProtagonistA stood before the remains of ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA felt a sense of sadness and loss 
 But ProtagonistA was not alone 
ProtagonistA was walking home from ProtagonistA's friend 's house when ProtagonistA heard the rain start 
 ProtagonistA looked up and saw the rain coming down hard 
 ProtagonistA started to run , but ProtagonistA's shoes and coat got soaked through 
 ProtagonistA was cold and wet by the time ProtagonistA got home 
 ProtagonistA was glad to be inside and out of the rain 
ProtagonistA sat and watched the sun go down slowly , with ProtagonistA's eyes closed 
 ProtagonistA thought about all the people ProtagonistA had known and all the places ProtagonistA had been 
 ProtagonistA thought about the good times and the bad times 
 And as ProtagonistA sat there , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was happy 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life and with who ProtagonistA had become 
ProtagonistA had been on the road for days , ever since ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's home in the city 
 ProtagonistA had been heading north , towards the mountains , but now ProtagonistA was stopped in ProtagonistA's tracks 
 ProtagonistA sighed as ProtagonistA put up the last of the white slacks that covered the back of the carriage 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping to find some kind of help or shelter before nightfall , but it seemed like that was not going to be the case 
 ProtagonistA was about to turn back around and head back the way ProtagonistA came when ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance 
 ProtagonistA followed the noise until ProtagonistA came to a small clearing 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to just leave ProtagonistB there , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to help ProtagonistB either 
 ProtagonistA was about to turn and go back the way ProtagonistA came when ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with pleading eyes 
 ProtagonistA sighed and sat down next to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA could say to make ProtagonistB feel better , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to try 
 It 's going to be alright ,  ProtagonistA said softly 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what else to do , so ProtagonistA just sat there with ProtagonistB until ProtagonistB fell asleep 
 When morning came , ProtagonistA woke ProtagonistB up and helped ProtagonistB to ProtagonistB's feet 
 ProtagonistA led ProtagonistB back to the road and helped ProtagonistB to find ProtagonistB's way home 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what would happen to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had done what ProtagonistA could 
ProtagonistA was walking in the park when ProtagonistA saw a rabbit 
 ProtagonistA followed the rabbit and fell into a hole 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a strange place 
 ProtagonistA saw a cat and asked it where ProtagonistA was 
  Then ProtagonistA saw a Cheshire cat and it said ,  Welcome to Wonderland 
  ProtagonistA met a lot of strange creatures in Wonderland and had many adventures 
ProtagonistA had been playing for hours , and the time had come for ProtagonistA to break out of ProtagonistA's gloomy cell and play 
 ProtagonistA had been planning ProtagonistA's escape for weeks , and everything was finally in place 
 ProtagonistA had made a rope out of bedsheets and tied it to the bars of ProtagonistA's window 
 ProtagonistA had smuggled a knife out of the kitchen and hidden it in ProtagonistA's pocket 
 And ProtagonistA had made friends with the rats who lived in the cell next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA waited until the guards had changed shift , and then ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's move 
 ProtagonistA climbed out the window and shimmied down the rope 
 Then ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way to the rat 's cell and let them out 
 ProtagonistA ran as fast as ProtagonistA could , and ProtagonistA did n't look back until ProtagonistA was outside the walls of the prison 
 ProtagonistA was finally free ! And ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's whole life ahead of ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was having a great time at the party 
 ProtagonistA was dancing and laughing with ProtagonistA's friends when ProtagonistA suddenly felt dizzy 
 ProtagonistA tried to hold on to something , but ProtagonistA could n't grasp anything and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA falling 
 ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistA's head on the ground and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die 
ProtagonistA , in the year 1581 , appeared on the scene with a discovery ProtagonistA could not have dreamed of three years before : in the journal of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA found two passages which ProtagonistA named The Book of Dreams 
 ProtagonistA was amazed by these dreams and felt that they must have some special meaning 
 ProtagonistA was convinced that they were signs from ProtagonistD , and ProtagonistA was determined to find out what they meant 
 ProtagonistA began to study the Book of Dreams , and ProtagonistA soon came to believe that they were indeed messages from ProtagonistD 
 ProtagonistA began to share ProtagonistA's interpretation of the dreams with others , and ProtagonistA soon became known as a prophetess 
 ProtagonistA became a leader of a new religious movement , and ProtagonistA began to preach about the power of dreams and their ability to reveal the future 
 ProtagonistA started to make predictions about the future , and many of ProtagonistA's prophecies came true 
 ProtagonistA predicted the rise of a great ruler who would bring peace to the world , and ProtagonistA was proved right when Queen Elizabeth I came to the throne 
 ProtagonistA was a powerful voice for change , and ProtagonistA helped to bring about many reforms in the country 
In the midst of the great maze of blind alleys and crumbling buildings of London , on a sunny summer day in the year 1665 , ProtagonistA was able to enjoy the quiet hours of ProtagonistA's childhood when ProtagonistA alighted on streets where ProtagonistA could chat with pedestrians and shopkeepers without arousing suspicion 
 But ProtagonistA was fearless , and ProtagonistA loved to explore 
 One day , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a part of the city ProtagonistA had never seen before 
 ProtagonistA felt a little uneasy , but ProtagonistA was curious to see what was around the next corner 
 As ProtagonistA turned a corner , ProtagonistA saw a group of boys standing in a circle 
 But as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistB was not a child or an animal , but a small , old man 
 ProtagonistA ran to ProtagonistB and knelt down beside ProtagonistB 
  Are ProtagonistB all right ?  ProtagonistA asked , gently helping ProtagonistB to sit up 
 ProtagonistA was about to help ProtagonistB to ProtagonistB's feet when ProtagonistA heard the sound of running footsteps 
 ProtagonistA grabbed ProtagonistB's hand and ran with ProtagonistB down the street , not looking back until they were safe 
Not long ago , when ProtagonistA was a boy , ProtagonistA only knew how to read and write 
ProtagonistA sat on a rock on the banks of ProtagonistA's stream and stared out at the water in disbelief 
 ProtagonistA has always been a curious child , but ProtagonistA's curiosity seems to be a bit more 
 ProtagonistA 's always asking about the world and how things work 
 ProtagonistA wants to know why the sky is blue and why people are born the way they are 
 ProtagonistA is excited at the prospect of finally finding answers to ProtagonistA's questions 
 ProtagonistA meets other children like ProtagonistA , and finally feels like ProtagonistA has found ProtagonistA's place in the world 
 At the school , ProtagonistA finally learns what ProtagonistA is 
 ProtagonistA learns that ProtagonistA is special and that ProtagonistA's curiosity is a gift 
 ProtagonistA learns that ProtagonistA has a unique perspective on the world that can help others 
 ProtagonistA is finally happy and content 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA is different , but ProtagonistA also knows that ProtagonistA is special 
 And ProtagonistA is proud of it 
ProtagonistA had been waiting in line for the bus for what felt like forever 
 ProtagonistA was getting impatient and was about to give up and go home when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so angry that ProtagonistA shouted at ProtagonistB ,  Time 's up , ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistA shouted down at ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a peg - legged pirate who had lost ProtagonistA's leg in a battle with a giant squid 
 ProtagonistA was now the captain of ProtagonistA's own ship , the Black Pearl 
 ProtagonistA was standing on the platform of one of the other ships , the White Shark , that was docked in the middle city 
 ProtagonistA was looking at the other ships and thinking about ProtagonistA's next move 
 ProtagonistA had to find a way to get ProtagonistA's ship out of the city and back to the open sea 
 ProtagonistA knew that the White Shark was a fast ship and could outrun any of the other ships in the city 
 ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistB , was a good friend of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA decided to go and talk to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB's help ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA need to get ProtagonistA's ship out of the city 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB got their ships out of the city and back to the open sea 
ProtagonistA sat in the saddle and considered the plan ProtagonistA 'd been given 
 Once inside , ProtagonistA was to find the treasure that was hidden there and bring it back to ProtagonistA's employer 
 ProtagonistA was sure that there were traps and pitfalls hidden within the house , waiting to trip ProtagonistA up 
 But ProtagonistA was also sure that ProtagonistA was up to the challenge 
 With a final nod to ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA set off down the road , ready to face whatever challenges awaited ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had a solid build , and a big , broad smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA was always the life of the party , and ProtagonistA's friends loved ProtagonistA for it 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking with ProtagonistA's friends when ProtagonistA suddenly collapsed 
 ProtagonistA had been to Europe , Asia , Africa , and now ProtagonistA was in Australia 
 ProtagonistA was starting to feel like a world traveler , and ProtagonistA was getting homesick 
 ProtagonistA missed the familiarity of ProtagonistA's home , and ProtagonistA was starting to get tired of all the new places 
 ProtagonistA wanted to go home , but ProtagonistA had one more stop on ProtagonistA's itinerary : New Zealand 
 ProtagonistA was excited to see New Zealand , but ProtagonistA was also ready to go home 
 ProtagonistA was ready to be done with ProtagonistA's long journey , and ProtagonistA was looking forward to being home for the holidays 
ProtagonistA had nothing to do with it , ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA was just in the wrong place at the wrong time 
 ProtagonistA was the only one who could have done it 
 But ProtagonistA swore ProtagonistA did n't do it 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was innocent 
 But ProtagonistA swore ProtagonistA did n't do it 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was innocent 
 But ProtagonistA swore ProtagonistA did n't do it 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was innocent 
 But ProtagonistA swore ProtagonistA did n't do it 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was innocent 
ProtagonistA woke up to a world that was red and white 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what had happened , but ProtagonistA could tell that it was a great victory 
 ProtagonistA helped the conquered armies and made sure that they were well taken care of 
 ProtagonistA was a great leader and everyone respected ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA came across a herd of very lean , very short - legged geldings , without heads or tails , that were waiting for the moon to rise 
 ProtagonistA even rode on one of the horses 
ProtagonistA was a unicorn who was always getting into trouble 
 ProtagonistA was always doing something wrong and it seemed like nothing ProtagonistA did was ever right 
 ProtagonistA might not be a good unicorn , but ProtagonistA 's not going anywhere 
ProtagonistA had always been a bright girl , but ProtagonistA was especially sharp for ProtagonistA's eleven years 
 ProtagonistA had been so busy with business of which ProtagonistA did not know at the time just how many it involved — foremost of all , business in the real world 
 In the real world , ProtagonistA had to be careful 
 It was a lot of work , but ProtagonistA was up for the challenge 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking near ProtagonistA's home when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should stay away from ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was curious 
 ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistB cautiously 
 Hello ,  ProtagonistA said 
  Can ProtagonistA help you?The man stepped out of the shadows 
 Do ProtagonistA know her?Alice 's heart skipped a beat 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should n't tell ProtagonistB anything , but ProtagonistA was also afraid of what would happen if ProtagonistA did n't 
 ProtagonistA decided to stall for time 
 Maybe ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was lying 
 ProtagonistA do n't believe ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB go , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
 ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistB was up to no good 
 ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistA and warn ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was driving down the main thoroughfares of London when ProtagonistA saw in the distance what looked to ProtagonistA like some vast city , on a smooth , grey sea 
 ProtagonistA drove on into the world of the great traders and navigators and found ProtagonistA in a huge port with many large ships 
 ProtagonistA watched for a while and then drove on , feeling very lucky to have stumbled upon this hidden gem 
ProtagonistA woke up from ProtagonistA's dream panting 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had just run a marathon 
 In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA was in a vast garden surrounded by a crowd of people 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was the only one who could see them 
 ProtagonistA felt a tap on ProtagonistA's shoulder and woke up to find ProtagonistB shaking ProtagonistA awake 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA were moaning in ProtagonistA's sleep 
 ProtagonistA just had a really weird dream ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA lay in ProtagonistA's bed for a few more minutes , trying to remember the details of ProtagonistA's dream 
 ProtagonistA was sure that it meant something , but ProtagonistA could n't quite figure out what 
ProtagonistA was out hiking on the Colorado hills when ProtagonistA was attacked by a rattlesnake 
 ProtagonistA was in a lot of pain and knew ProtagonistA needed to get to a hospital quickly 
 ProtagonistA managed to make ProtagonistA's way down the hill and flag down a passing car 
 ProtagonistA was lucky that the driver was there to help ProtagonistA 
 If ProtagonistA had been left alone on the hill , ProtagonistA might not have made it to the hospital in time 
 ProtagonistA was also lucky that the snake did n't bite ProtagonistA anywhere else on ProtagonistA's body 
 ProtagonistA recovered from ProtagonistA's injuries and is now able to hike and enjoy the outdoors again 
ProtagonistA was riding in the midst of a dry and calm autumn season 
 ProtagonistA rode on clear , and ProtagonistA knew that the wind of Britain was blowing 
 And ProtagonistA was safe and ProtagonistA would have to ride on 
 ProtagonistA was riding on comfortable white , and ProtagonistA knew that the air was cool 
 And if ProtagonistA was found hanged , ProtagonistA could always lie down for a long time and sleep peacefully and rest easy 
ProtagonistA was an old woman who lived on a horse 
 ProtagonistA was very much of this world , but ProtagonistA had neither the strength nor the patience for weariness nor for labor 
 ProtagonistA was never mowing grass alone 
 One day , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB would like to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had just finished ProtagonistA's morning prayers and was about to enjoy a cup of tea when ProtagonistA heard a commotion coming from the roof of the Boston house 
 ProtagonistA went to investigate and saw that a group of ProtagonistB's followers were gathered there , apparently preparing to re - enact something 
 ProtagonistA was curious to know what was going on , so ProtagonistA asked one of the members what was happening 
 When it was over , ProtagonistA thanked the members for letting ProtagonistA witness the event and went back to ProtagonistA's tea 
 ProtagonistA had seen the signs of a shipwreck on the other side of the island , so ProtagonistA knew there must be other people around here somewhere 
 But ProtagonistA had yet to find them 
 As ProtagonistA lay there , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA sat up , hopeful that ProtagonistB was another castaway 
 But as ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB was not a person at all , but a large , furry creature 
 ProtagonistA had heard stories of people being killed and eaten by bears 
 ProtagonistA scrambled to ProtagonistA's feet and started to run , but ProtagonistB was faster than ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes , expecting the worst 
 But instead of being eaten , ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistB licking ProtagonistA's face 
 When ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes , ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB looked just as scared as ProtagonistA felt 
 Please do n't eat ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA begged 
 ProtagonistA felt a pang of sympathy for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew how ProtagonistB felt 
 Let 's team up ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB spent the next few days searching the island for food 
 This looks promising ,  ProtagonistA said 
 Thank ProtagonistB for not eating ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was three years old when ProtagonistB died 
 ProtagonistA remembers that ProtagonistB was always so kind to ProtagonistA , even when ProtagonistA was having a bad day 
 ProtagonistA would always go to ProtagonistB's house after school and they would spend hours talking and laughing together 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to cope with the loss of ProtagonistB 
 But over time , ProtagonistA began to heal 
 Now , whenever ProtagonistA thinks of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA smiles 
 ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA did n't mean to 
 ProtagonistA was just trying to help 
 ProtagonistA did n't know that would happen 
 ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistC more than anything in the world 
ProtagonistA had been a fan of the Hogsmeade Horror book series since ProtagonistA was a child 
 ProtagonistA loved the suspense and the scares , and ProtagonistA had always dreamed of being a writer ProtagonistA 
 So when ProtagonistA saw the final edition of the series , revised and corrected by a professional team , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to have it 
 ProtagonistA sat down in a chair near the front desk of ProtagonistA's local bookshop and started reading the book with a certain concentration 
 ProtagonistA did n't know it then , but ProtagonistA was about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime 
 ProtagonistA was just happy to be reading the final edition of ProtagonistA's favorite series 
 But then , as ProtagonistA turned the page , ProtagonistA saw something that made ProtagonistA's heart stop 
 ProtagonistA gasped and dropped the book 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA was in the Hogsmeade Horror series!But that was n't all 
ProtagonistA is a hundred years old , and ProtagonistA's name is ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA has lived through two world wars , and seen the rise and fall of many empires 
 ProtagonistA has witnessed the birth of the modern world , and the dawn of the digital age 
 ProtagonistA has seen the world change in ways that ProtagonistA never could have imagined , and ProtagonistA has adapted to each new era 
 ProtagonistA is a woman of great intelligence and strength 
 ProtagonistA is a woman who has fought for ProtagonistA's rights , and the rights of others 
 ProtagonistA is a woman who has always been ahead of ProtagonistA's time 
 And yet , in spite of all ProtagonistA has accomplished , ProtagonistA feels as though ProtagonistA has not truly lived 
 ProtagonistA has never had a family of ProtagonistA's own , and ProtagonistA has never known the love of a man 
 ProtagonistA has never had the chance to experience the joys and sorrows of motherhood 
 ProtagonistA often wonders what ProtagonistA's life would have been like if ProtagonistA had been born in another time , and in another place 
 Would ProtagonistA have been happier ? Would ProtagonistA have been more fulfilled?She will never know the answers to these questions , but ProtagonistA does know one thing : ProtagonistA is grateful for the life ProtagonistA has lived , and for the lessons ProtagonistA has learned 
ProtagonistA was staying at a hotel for a conference 
 ProtagonistA was sitting in the hotel restaurant , having breakfast before ProtagonistA's first day of meetings 
 ProtagonistA took little notice of the dish next to ProtagonistA on the table 
 ProtagonistA must have been really hungry this morning and not even noticed ! ProtagonistA felt a little embarrassed , but was glad ProtagonistA had n't made a scene by devouring someone else 's breakfast 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a trouble , but ProtagonistA had been more of a bother than most when ProtagonistA had been twelve 
 ProtagonistA had gotten into a lot of fights with other kids and had even been suspended from school for a week 
 ProtagonistA had been skeptical at first , but ProtagonistA had soon started to open up to ProtagonistA's therapist 
 ProtagonistA had talked about ProtagonistA's problems and ProtagonistA's feelings 
 ProtagonistA had even started to work on some of ProtagonistA's issues 
 Slowly but surely , ProtagonistA had started to improve 
 Now , at eighteen , ProtagonistA was a completely different person 
 ProtagonistA was still a bit of a troublemaker , but ProtagonistA was nowhere near as bad as ProtagonistA had been before 
 ProtagonistA had even managed to stay out of trouble for the past year 
ProtagonistA was walking in the palace garden when ProtagonistA saw a water droplet that had fallen from the sky the night before 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and found a beautiful garden that ProtagonistA had never seen before 
 The garden was full of flowers , and ProtagonistA was amazed 
 ProtagonistA followed the droplet as it led ProtagonistA to a fountain in the center of the garden 
 When ProtagonistA jumped into the fountain , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a different world 
ProtagonistA was having a lovely time at the tea party when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB's most recent folly 
 ProtagonistA stood up and announced to the others that ProtagonistA was going to put a stop to ProtagonistB's madness once and for all 
 ProtagonistA marched over to where ProtagonistB was standing and confronted ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA demanded to know what ProtagonistB was thinking , creating such a ridiculous plot 
 ProtagonistA was so angry that ProtagonistA wanted to scream , but ProtagonistA knew that would only give ProtagonistB the satisfaction of knowing ProtagonistB had gotten to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and walked away , vowing to never give ProtagonistB the satisfaction of winning again 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the front steps of their house , looking down at the dusty back lot 
 ProtagonistA did n't believe it when ProtagonistA saw a figure walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB in years 
 ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA ca n't believe it ! What are ProtagonistB doing here ?  ProtagonistA said , as ProtagonistA got up to give ProtagonistB a hug 
 ProtagonistA 've been busy too 
 I'd like that ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA sat back down on the steps , smiling to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was a smart little thing 
 ProtagonistA was not really a girl , but which people thought was a girl , because ProtagonistA would turn into ProtagonistB instead of into a girl 
 And ProtagonistA had been mistaken , they say , from the first moment when ProtagonistA was born 
 ProtagonistA had believed everything ProtagonistA had been told 
 But one day , ProtagonistA began to doubt 
 ProtagonistA started to wonder why ProtagonistA was always turned into ProtagonistB 
 Was it because ProtagonistA was really a bad person ? Or was it because the people around ProtagonistA were just ProtagonistA decided to find out for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA started to act like a girl , and to ProtagonistA's surprise , ProtagonistA began to turn into one 
 The more ProtagonistA did it , the more ProtagonistA became like a girl , until ProtagonistA was one completely 
 Now , ProtagonistA is a happy girl , and ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA was never really a bad person , despite what people might have thought 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA was just misunderstood , and that ProtagonistA is now exactly who ProtagonistA was meant to be 
ProtagonistA was looking at the pile of papers which covered the table and ProtagonistA said ,  What a sad sight , to lose one 's mind 
  ProtagonistA was thinking about how ProtagonistA's own mind had been slipping lately 
 ProtagonistA could n't remember things like ProtagonistA used to and ProtagonistA was having trouble concentrating 
 ProtagonistA had seen it happen to other people and ProtagonistA did n't want to end up like them 
As soon as ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the bed and stared out the window 
 ProtagonistA got up and went to the window , opening it and taking a deep breath of the fresh air 
 ProtagonistA turned and went back to ProtagonistA's bed , lying down and closing ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA let out a long sigh , feeling the tension leave ProtagonistA's body 
ProtagonistA was wearing the same dress , and the same red dress , and the same black dress , and at the same time ProtagonistA was in the same place , in the same sudden moment , in the same instant , in the same place , in the same place , ProtagonistA was in the same place , ProtagonistA was wearing the same dress , and the same dress , and ProtagonistA was walking along , and ProtagonistA just kept walking , and ProtagonistA stopped in a little corner ( not much to go on there , there 's no way to tell where exactly ) and looked around for a second , and then laid ProtagonistA's head down on the hood of the car and leaned ProtagonistA's head against the passenger side window 
 ProtagonistA was pointing to a small island in the middle of the ocean 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends were on a treasure hunt and this was their final clue 
 But ProtagonistA was calm 
 ProtagonistA knew there must be a clue on the island 
 ProtagonistA started to look around again 
 ProtagonistA dug around it and found a chest 
ProtagonistA was in so much pain that ProtagonistA could barely move 
 ProtagonistA slowly rolled over , trying to get away from the source of the pain 
 When ProtagonistA finally stopped moving , ProtagonistA looked up and saw ProtagonistB lying on the ground next to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been waiting in line for what felt like hours 
 ProtagonistA was getting impatient and was about to ask the person in front of ProtagonistA what was taking so long when ProtagonistA finally reached the front 
  What is all this ?  ProtagonistA asked , finally 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping against hope that this was all a mistake , that ProtagonistA's husband had n't really filed for divorce 
 ProtagonistA was about to be a single woman again 
 Is there anything else ProtagonistA need to do ?  ProtagonistA asked , ProtagonistA's voice trembling 
ProtagonistA was walking home from school when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing on the side of the road 
 ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was in distress , so ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistB to see if ProtagonistA could help 
 ProtagonistA , being the helpful person ProtagonistA is , said that ProtagonistA knew of a farmhouse not too far from there that might be able to help 
 ProtagonistA offered to take ProtagonistB there , and ProtagonistB accepted 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB all about ProtagonistA's life on the farm and how much ProtagonistA loved animals 
 ProtagonistA hesitated , but ProtagonistB assured ProtagonistA that they were just a harmless old couple 
 ProtagonistA walked into the farmhouse and was immediately greeted by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA would love to , and the two exchanged addresses 
 ProtagonistA walked home that night feeling happy and content 
 ProtagonistA had made some new friends , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would always remember ProtagonistA's meeting with the Listers 
ProtagonistA came in a beaten and battered carriage 
 ProtagonistA was carrying ProtagonistB across the country 
 ProtagonistA was tired and the journey was long , but ProtagonistA did not complain 
 ProtagonistA just kept going 
 When they finally arrived home , ProtagonistA put ProtagonistB in bed and tended to ProtagonistB's wounds 
 ProtagonistA did not know if ProtagonistB would make it through the night 
ProtagonistA had seen true horror cross flying over a dozen times during ProtagonistA's time as head of the Department of Magical and Philosophical Research , but ProtagonistA never imagined that one might actually be made at the end of one 's life ! As ProtagonistA lay on ProtagonistA's deathbed , ProtagonistA could see the dark shadow of the creature flying towards ProtagonistA , its mouth open in a silent scream 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's time was up 
ProtagonistA was standing in the doorway , ProtagonistA's dark hair up in a ponytail 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a white tank top and denim shorts 
 ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA was about to go for a run 
 I asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was up to and ProtagonistA told me ProtagonistA was going for a run 
 ProtagonistA smiled and we took off 
 ProtagonistA smiled and said ProtagonistA felt the same way 
 ProtagonistA had been in the forest for days , ever since ProtagonistA had run away from home 
 ProtagonistA was tired , and hungry , and ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's family 
 But ProtagonistA was also determined to find ProtagonistA's way back to them 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
Something 's up , said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA cradled the great volcano in ProtagonistA's hands 
 ProtagonistA had never seen a volcano up close before , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to expect 
 ProtagonistA did n't want that to happen again 
 ProtagonistA had been watching the volcano for weeks , and ProtagonistA was sure that something was going to happen soon 
 ProtagonistA could feel it in the air 
 ProtagonistA had to warn the others 
 ProtagonistA had to get them to safety before it was too late 
 ProtagonistA ran through the streets , shouting warnings to everyone ProtagonistA saw 
 ProtagonistA had to get them to safety before the volcano erupted 
 ProtagonistA had been there for ProtagonistB , holding ProtagonistB's hand and telling ProtagonistB everything would be alright 
 ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's only family and now ProtagonistA had no one 
 As ProtagonistA stood there , looking at ProtagonistB's grave , ProtagonistA swore ProtagonistA would never let ProtagonistA be so vulnerable again 
 ProtagonistA would never let anyone in and ProtagonistA would never love anyone as much as ProtagonistA had loved ProtagonistB 
 From that day on , ProtagonistA became a cold and heartless woman 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole and decided to follow it 
 ProtagonistA ended up in ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had many adventures in ProtagonistB and made many new friends 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's way back home 
ProtagonistA was overjoyed when ProtagonistA was told that ProtagonistA would be having dinner with ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA arrived at ProtagonistB's house , ProtagonistA was amazed by its beauty 
ProtagonistA was facing away from the screen on the golden - tufted hill that bounded ProtagonistA's sea - walls , and the sunbeams streaming across the black sand stilled as it was 
 ProtagonistA breathed in the salty air and let ProtagonistA's body relax into the warmth 
ProtagonistA had been standing in the doorway all night , waiting for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been waiting for ProtagonistB to come home from work , but ProtagonistB never came 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was working late , but ProtagonistA could n't help but worry 
 ProtagonistA was about to go to bed when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB's key in the door 
 ProtagonistA ran to ProtagonistB and hugged ProtagonistB tightly 
 ProtagonistA was so relieved ProtagonistB was finally home 
ProtagonistA was living in ProtagonistA's cousin 's vast old house in Pannonward called the Park 
 ProtagonistA loved spending time in the park , reading and picnicking with ProtagonistA's friends 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was enjoying the sunshine , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had only been a woman of ProtagonistA's word , when a magic box stood in ProtagonistA's front door , containing a box of eleven tiny little things , wrapped in a blue and white little envelope 
 ProtagonistA had promised ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA would never open it , but the temptation was too great 
 ProtagonistA carefully unwrapped the envelope andopened the box 
 ProtagonistA could n't resist poking ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so astonished that ProtagonistA forgot to be scared 
 ProtagonistA watched as the eleven tiny people scurried about , trying to hide from ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA sat down and watched them , feeling like ProtagonistA had been given a gift 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget them 
ProtagonistA was over the moon when ProtagonistA found out ProtagonistA was pregnant 
 ProtagonistA immediately called ProtagonistA's best friend to share the news 
ProtagonistA had always wanted a dog 
 ProtagonistA would beg ProtagonistA's parents for one every time they went to the pet store , but they always said no 
 ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB quickly became ProtagonistA's best friend 
 ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistB for walks , play fetch with ProtagonistB in the yard , and snuggle with ProtagonistB at night 
ProtagonistA was a woman who loved to travel 
 ProtagonistA was always on the move , never staying in one place for too long 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful woman , with long dark hair and bright blue eyes 
 ProtagonistA was always well - dressed and carried ProtagonistA with a regal air 
 ProtagonistA was always the life of the party and always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
ProtagonistA was a very special girl 
 ProtagonistA was the daughter of Henry Vane , Earl of Essex , cousin of King James 
 ProtagonistA was very beautiful and very intelligent 
 ProtagonistA was also very kind and always helped others 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking in the forest and ProtagonistA saw a rabbit 
 ProtagonistA followed the rabbit and ProtagonistA found a hole in the ground 
 ProtagonistA looked in the hole and ProtagonistA saw a beautiful garden 
 ProtagonistA went into the house and ProtagonistA saw a lot of people 
 ProtagonistA was very happy too 
 ProtagonistA was a carpenter , and ProtagonistB was a housewife 
 One day , ProtagonistA came home from work and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had been thinking about getting a divorce 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA was not happy with their life , and ProtagonistA wanted to try something new 
 ProtagonistA agreed , and ProtagonistA went to work the next day 
 However , ProtagonistA could not stop thinking about what ProtagonistB had said 
 ProtagonistA thought about it all day , and ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA wanted to get a divorce 
 ProtagonistA went home and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had made up ProtagonistA's mind 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of ProtagonistA's bed , looking out at the booming blue sky 
 ProtagonistA squinted and turned away , but not before ProtagonistA saw the bright orange and red leaves of the trees 
 But today , ProtagonistA had other plans 
 ProtagonistA was going to go outside and enjoy the weather while it lasted 
 ProtagonistA quickly got dressed and grabbed ProtagonistA's jacket , heading for the door 
 But before ProtagonistA could even take one step outside , ProtagonistA heard a loud boom 
 ProtagonistA slowly opened the door and peeked outside , half expecting to see a monster or something 
 ProtagonistA quickly shut the door and leaned against it , trying to catch ProtagonistA's breath 
 ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA must be dreaming 
 But then ProtagonistA heard the rabbit pounding on the door , and ProtagonistA knew this was real 
 ProtagonistA had to find a way to get out of this situation 
 ProtagonistA opened the door a crack and peeked out again 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be careful , but ProtagonistA also knew ProtagonistA had to find a way out of here 
 ProtagonistA slowly stepped outside , keeping ProtagonistA's eyes peeled for the rabbit 
 But as ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's first step , ProtagonistA felt something give way beneath ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistA looked down and saw that ProtagonistA was standing on a large , round , white rabbit 
 ProtagonistA knew this was ProtagonistA's chance to escape 
 ProtagonistA quickly ran away from the rabbit and did n't look back until ProtagonistA was safely inside ProtagonistA's house 
 ProtagonistA leaned against the door , trying to catch ProtagonistA's breath 
 ProtagonistA was sure this was the strangest day ProtagonistA had ever experienced 
ProtagonistA had always loved the farm ProtagonistA lived on 
 It was ProtagonistA's home and ProtagonistA could n't imagine living anywhere else 
 So when ProtagonistA's cousin 's pet phoenix needed a home , ProtagonistA knew just the place 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's neighbor and bought the farm 
 ProtagonistA wanted to make sure ProtagonistA's cousin 's pet had a comfortable and safe place to live 
 It was a beautiful creature and ProtagonistA was happy to have been able to help provide a home for it 
ProtagonistA was a bit confused when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's school 
 ProtagonistA thought that maybe ProtagonistA was seeing things but when ProtagonistA looked again , ProtagonistB was still there 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to think or do so ProtagonistA just stared at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart flutter a bit and ProtagonistA quickly looked away 
 ProtagonistA did n't know why but ProtagonistA felt drawn to ProtagonistB 
 Throughout the day , ProtagonistA would catch glimpses of ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA started to feel more and more comfortable around ProtagonistB 
 By the end of the day , ProtagonistA had mustered up the courage to talk to ProtagonistB 
 Hi , ProtagonistA 'm Alice ,  ProtagonistA said shyly 
 ProtagonistA and John quickly became friends and they would often talk and laugh together 
 ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA had finally found someone who understood ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been sleeping all that time and was still sleeping when ProtagonistA began to cry 
 ProtagonistA woke up crying , and it took ProtagonistA a moment to realize that ProtagonistA was alone in ProtagonistA's room 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to the window , looking out at the world as ProtagonistA wiped ProtagonistA's tears away 
ProtagonistA looked as though ProtagonistA had been through hell — like little others do 
 ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA had been through a war 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had been through abuse , both physical and mental 
 ProtagonistA had been through abandonment and betrayal 
 ProtagonistA had been through heartbreak and loss 
 ProtagonistA had been through hell , and ProtagonistA had come out the other side 
 ProtagonistA was a survivor 
 ProtagonistA was strong and resilient 
 ProtagonistA had been through more than most people could even imagine , and yet ProtagonistA was still standing 
 ProtagonistA was a fighter , and ProtagonistA was not going to give up 
 ProtagonistA was going to make it through this 
 ProtagonistA was going to make it through whatever life threw at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was going to survive 
ProtagonistA stood on the doorstep of ProtagonistA's house , watching as ProtagonistA's husband , Major Rufus James Alberts , drove into the town with his wife 
 ProtagonistA felt a pang of jealousy as ProtagonistA watched them drive away , but ProtagonistA quickly pushed it aside 
 After all , ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's own life to live 
 ProtagonistA turned and went back into the house , ProtagonistA's mind already busy with other things 
ProtagonistA is sitting down by the window , reading a book which ProtagonistA has brought into ProtagonistA's room , and without speaking 
 ProtagonistA is so engrossed in the book that ProtagonistA does not hear ProtagonistB come into the room 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA , why are ProtagonistA reading in ProtagonistA's room by ProtagonistA ? Do n't ProtagonistA want to come downstairs and spend some time with the ProtagonistA looks up from ProtagonistA's book , a little embarrassed 
 ProtagonistA just really wanted to finish this book 
 ProtagonistA goes back to ProtagonistA's book , and ProtagonistB leaves the room 
 ProtagonistA , there ProtagonistA are 
 ProtagonistA just really wanted to finish this book

 ProtagonistA is so engrossed in the story that ProtagonistA does not hear the doorbell ring a few minutes later 
 ProtagonistA does not hear ProtagonistB come upstairs and tell ProtagonistA that there is someone there to see ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA is so surprised when ProtagonistA sees ProtagonistA's best friend standing in the doorway that ProtagonistA almost drops ProtagonistA's book 
 What are you doing here ?  ProtagonistA exclaims 
 And ProtagonistA was reading because ProtagonistA wanted to , not because ProtagonistA was lonely 
 ProtagonistA was just reading a book 
 ProtagonistA goes back to ProtagonistA's book , and ProtagonistA's friend leaves the room 
 ProtagonistA is so engrossed in the story that ProtagonistA does not hear ProtagonistB come in a few minutes later

ProtagonistA had always wanted a man with blond hair , but when ProtagonistA was eight the first color on ProtagonistA's face changed into something untidy and unpleasant 
 When ProtagonistA was sixteen , ProtagonistA found the man of ProtagonistA's dreams and they married 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted a man with blond hair and now ProtagonistA was stuck with a man whose hair was falling out and turning green 
ProtagonistA turned into the white stucco garden where ProtagonistA was working and then into the street 
 ProtagonistA walked for a while , not really knowing where ProtagonistA was going 
 ProtagonistA had always been a wanderer , and it had gotten ProtagonistA into trouble in the past 
 ProtagonistA had a sense of purpose 
 ProtagonistA eventually found ProtagonistA at the edge of the city 
 ProtagonistA had never been this far before 
 ProtagonistA looked out at the vastness of the world beyond and felt a sense of wonder 
 ProtagonistA knew there was more out there for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned and walked back into the city , ready to start ProtagonistA's new adventure 
 ProtagonistA had blue eyes , brown hair , and a florid face 
 ProtagonistA was always the one to put a smile on everyone 's face , and ProtagonistA was always the one to make things happen 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to change the way things were done 
 ProtagonistA wanted to make a difference in the world , and ProtagonistA wanted to start with ProtagonistA's own community 
 ProtagonistA gathered a group of people together and started a movement to make ProtagonistA's community a better place 
 ProtagonistA believed in ProtagonistA's community and ProtagonistA believed in the power of change 
ProtagonistA lay with ProtagonistA's legs crossed , rocking back and forth 
 ProtagonistA was exhausted , but ProtagonistA could n't seem to stop ProtagonistA's mind from racing 
 ProtagonistA tried to focus on ProtagonistA's breath , to clear ProtagonistA's mind , but it was no use 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice 
  ProtagonistA ,  the voice said 
  ProtagonistA was surprised , but ProtagonistA got up and went to bed 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who the voice belonged to , but ProtagonistA was grateful for the reminder 
ProtagonistA was an old woman who lived in a small village in China 
 ProtagonistA agreed and said ,  Our granda said , said ProtagonistA , that ProtagonistB was the daughter of the Empress Cǎo ; but ProtagonistB lived before that , and has been dead many years 
 ProtagonistA told them that ProtagonistB was a very beautiful woman who lived in a palace 
 So each morning , ProtagonistA rose to school and ProtagonistA's parents dragged their loaded and battered car into the driveway 
 However , ProtagonistA always felt a sense of longing for ProtagonistA's homeland 
 With nowhere else to go , ProtagonistA set off on foot by ProtagonistA's father 's donkey , Yede 
 ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to find a way to make a new life for ProtagonistA 
 After walking for days , ProtagonistA came across a small village 
 ProtagonistA quickly fell in love with the village and its people 
 ProtagonistA began working as a farmhand and soon became one of the most respected members of the community 
 After a few years , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC and they got married 
 ProtagonistA continued to live in the village for the rest of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had four children with ProtagonistC and watched as they grew up and had children of their own 
 As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA often thought about ProtagonistA's homeland and the orphanage ProtagonistA had once called home 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have found a new home in the village and knew that ProtagonistA would always be welcome there 
One day , when ProtagonistA was five years old , ProtagonistA was walking along the banks of the Thames , in a sort of drunken stupor 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA slipped and fell into the river 
 ProtagonistA struggled to swim to the surface , but the current was too strong 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA being pulled under 
 Just as ProtagonistA was about to give up , ProtagonistA felt someone grab ProtagonistA's arm and pull ProtagonistA to safety 
 When ProtagonistA looked up , ProtagonistA saw that it was the Queen 
 ProtagonistA never forgot that day , and ProtagonistA always treasured the memory of the Queen 's kindness 
 It was as if ProtagonistA was the only one who mattered in the world 
 ProtagonistA took full advantage of this newfound attention , and soon had ProtagonistB wrapped around ProtagonistA's finger 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would do anything ProtagonistA asked , and ProtagonistA used this to ProtagonistA's advantage 
 ProtagonistA would ask for money when ProtagonistA wanted it , and ProtagonistB would give it to ProtagonistA without question 
 ProtagonistA would go on shopping sprees and then return home to find ProtagonistB had already paid the bill 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB wrapped around ProtagonistA's finger , and ProtagonistA loved it 
 ProtagonistA loved feeling like ProtagonistA was the most important person in the world 
 And ProtagonistA loved knowing that ProtagonistB would do anything ProtagonistA asked 
ProtagonistA was the daughter of a Brooklyn market girl and a remorseless explorer 
 One day , as ProtagonistA was about to board the train , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt a sudden kinship with ProtagonistB and decided to strike up a conversation 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB became fast friends 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's exploration of the world beyond the Bronx and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's own explorations of the world within the borough 
 ProtagonistA and Lily are proof of that 
ProtagonistA was not what ProtagonistA had heard ProtagonistA was supposed to be 
 ProtagonistA was not a beautiful princess who lived in a fairytale castle 
 ProtagonistA was not kind and gentle and loved by all 
 In fact , ProtagonistA was quite the opposite 
 ProtagonistA was ugly and mean and no one liked ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was always getting into trouble and making life difficult for everyone around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was happy being who ProtagonistA was 
When ProtagonistA walked out of the office , ProtagonistA felt a certain relief 
 ProtagonistA had been dreading ProtagonistA's meeting with ProtagonistA's boss all day , but it had gone better than ProtagonistA could have hoped 
 As ProtagonistA walked to ProtagonistA's car , ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's worries melting away 
 ProtagonistA was looking forward to ProtagonistA's weekend now 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful young woman with long blonde hair 
 ProtagonistA lived in a small town in the middle of nowhere 
 ProtagonistA had a loving family , a great job , and a boyfriend who loved ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to make it through 
 But ProtagonistA was a strong woman , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could make it through anything 
ProtagonistA was nothing more than a mortal , and ProtagonistA had plenty of friends and lovers who ProtagonistA could trust 
 However , one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA soon fell in love with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA awoke the next day , feeling different 
 ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistB's presence inside ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had been changed forever 
 ProtagonistA was now a vampire ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA would have to live with the fact that ProtagonistA had killed many innocent people in order to survive 
 Victoria died in 1887 , and ProtagonistA died in 1901 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was out exploring the perimeter of the compound , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 A few weeks later , ProtagonistA managed to escape from the compound and found ProtagonistA's way to ProtagonistB's house 
 They were finally able to be together and ProtagonistA was happy 
ProtagonistA used to love ProtagonistA's boots , but they were as old as the southern mud and ProtagonistA hated the way they made ProtagonistA's feet feel so frail 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out in the field , working on the farm , when ProtagonistA felt something snap in ProtagonistA's boot 
 ProtagonistA took it off to find that the sole had completely come off 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't go into town like this , so ProtagonistA had to make do with what ProtagonistA had 
 ProtagonistA wrapped ProtagonistA's feet in some old rags and tied them up with string 
 ProtagonistA was walking home from ProtagonistA's friend 's house , where ProtagonistA had spent the night 
 ProtagonistA liked the peace and quiet of the journey 
 As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's life and what ProtagonistA wanted to do with it 
 ProtagonistA had always been a good student , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA wanted to go to college 
 ProtagonistA loved art and wanted to be an artist , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA was good enough 
 ProtagonistA had a lot of thinking to do 
Over the last three years , when I have been able to visit the house where ProtagonistA fathomed ProtagonistA's dreams , ProtagonistA has changed little 
 ProtagonistA has told me that ProtagonistA sometimes still dreams of ProtagonistA's adventures in Wonderland , and I know that ProtagonistA will never forget the day that ProtagonistA fell down the rabbit hole 
ProtagonistA was walking home from ProtagonistA's job at the local grocery store when ProtagonistA saw a group of kids huddled around something in the alley 
 ProtagonistA approached them and saw that they were looking at a dead cat 
 ProtagonistA knew they were up to no good 
 If ProtagonistA had known ProtagonistB was going to die , ProtagonistA could have prevented it 
 But ProtagonistA did n't know and ProtagonistB died in a car accident 
 ProtagonistA blamed ProtagonistA for not knowing and for not being able to save ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA began to notice that ProtagonistA was n't aging 
 ProtagonistA was still the same age as ProtagonistA was when ProtagonistB died 
 And then ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was immortal 
 ProtagonistA was scared at first , but then ProtagonistA realized that this was a gift 
 ProtagonistA could now live forever and see the world change 
 ProtagonistA could also help people and make a difference in the world 
 ProtagonistA is now living ProtagonistA's life to the fullest and enjoying every moment 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA has been given a gift and ProtagonistA is using it to make the world a better place 
ProtagonistA was always the vain one , always worrying about ProtagonistA's appearance and what others thought of ProtagonistA 
 So when the court papers dated May 6 , 1795 showed that ProtagonistB had put the cookery of ProtagonistA on ice , in order to prevent any further vanity , ProtagonistA knew that it was time to change ProtagonistA's ways 
 ProtagonistA started to pay more attention to ProtagonistA's inner self , and less to ProtagonistA's outward appearance 
 ProtagonistA stopped caring about what others thought of ProtagonistA , and started living ProtagonistA's life for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was walking towards the door of ProtagonistA's room , shaking ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA had just had a fight with ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA was still really upset 
 ProtagonistA was about to go into ProtagonistA's room and slam the door when ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB , walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA were upset about something 
 ProtagonistA sighed and told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's fight with ProtagonistC 
  Why do n't ProtagonistA go talk to ProtagonistC and see if ProtagonistA can work things ProtagonistA thought about what ProtagonistB said and ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistB was right 
 ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistC's house and they talked things out 
ProtagonistA stood there , though ProtagonistA was not quite sure why 
 ProtagonistA had been walking in the park when ProtagonistA saw the rabbit and followed it down the hole 
 Now ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a strange place with strange creatures 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what to do 
 Then ProtagonistA saw the cat and it seemed to be grinning at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA decided to follow it 
 ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and excitement as ProtagonistA sailed towards ProtagonistA's destination 
 ProtagonistA knew that , whatever awaited ProtagonistA in Bucklemore , it would be an adventure 
 ProtagonistA was the daughter of a nobleman and grew up in a wealthy household 
 When ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB and they had two children 
 ProtagonistA was a kind and loving mother , but ProtagonistA was also a very strong woman 
 ProtagonistA was not afraid to speak ProtagonistA's mind , and ProtagonistA often did so in ProtagonistB's presence 
 However , ProtagonistA always managed to keep ProtagonistA's temper in check 
 ProtagonistA was very bored , and ProtagonistA decided to go for a walk 
 As ProtagonistA was walking , ProtagonistA came across a group of peasants who were having a picnic 
 ProtagonistA stopped to talk to them , and ProtagonistA soon became friends with them 
 ProtagonistA continued to meet with ProtagonistA's new friends , and ProtagonistA even started to teach them how to read and write 
 ProtagonistA was now a single mother , but ProtagonistA was not afraid 
 ProtagonistA continued to meet with ProtagonistA's friends , and ProtagonistA even started a school for them 
 ProtagonistA taught them how to read and write , and ProtagonistA also taught them about the world 
 ProtagonistA wanted them to be able to make their own decisions , and ProtagonistA wanted them to be able to think for themselves 
 ProtagonistA is an example of a strong and independent woman , and ProtagonistA is an example to all women who want to make a difference in the world 
ProtagonistA was grateful when they let ProtagonistA stay longer in the room 
 ProtagonistA felt like a piece of luggage that was being stored away for safekeeping 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have a place to stay , even if it was just for a little while 
 ProtagonistA knew that eventually ProtagonistA would have to leave , but ProtagonistA was thankful for the time ProtagonistA had 
 ProtagonistA tried to speak , but ProtagonistA's words were slurred and incomprehensible 
ProtagonistA had finally decided to carve a story for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA began carving into the wood , telling the story of how they met , their life together , and how ProtagonistB's death had affected ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA carved , ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistB's presence with ProtagonistA , and it brought ProtagonistA's comfort 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was listening , and that ProtagonistB would always be with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was always so independent and carefree 
 ProtagonistA suddenly saw the potential for a life with ProtagonistB - a life with love and laughter and happiness 
 And when they found out they were expecting a baby , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was ready to be a mother 
 ProtagonistA was ready to give ProtagonistA's child everything ProtagonistA never had 
 ProtagonistA was ready to love unconditionally 
ProtagonistA has been acting like a mother ever since I left 
 ProtagonistA put a few things in ProtagonistA's mouth and ProtagonistA 's gone very much as a mother 
 My mom said no , but ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA would take me 
 ProtagonistA held my hand the whole time and made sure I was safe 
 ProtagonistA 's my rock , my protector , and my best friend 
ProtagonistA was four years old when ProtagonistA heard the news that ProtagonistA's father had been murdered 
 ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's room , playing with ProtagonistA's dolls when ProtagonistA's mother came in and told ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't understand what it meant at first , but ProtagonistA could see the pain in ProtagonistA's mother 's eyes 
 Over the next few days , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's mother crying a lot and ProtagonistA began to understand that ProtagonistA's father was never coming back 
 ProtagonistA was sad and scared , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to be strong for ProtagonistA's mother 
 ProtagonistA was always so quiet and withdrawn , never really engaging with them 
 But ProtagonistA was insistent 
 ProtagonistA showed them pictures and videos of ProtagonistA's life as this other person 
 ProtagonistA told them about the things ProtagonistA had done and seen 
ProtagonistA stood on the beach , ProtagonistA's face blackened with the blood of many a dead human 
 ProtagonistA had been fighting in the war for years , and ProtagonistA had seen and done things that ProtagonistA never thought possible 
 But , ProtagonistA had never seen anything like this 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA just stood there , looking at the carnage around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA looked around at the empty room and the sunlight streaming in through the windows 
 ProtagonistA felt a sudden urge to go for a walk 
 ProtagonistA went to the closet and got ProtagonistA's coat and scarf and headed out the door 
 As ProtagonistA walked down the street , ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and happiness 
 ProtagonistA walked for a long time , enjoying the fresh air and the sights and sounds of the city 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA at St
 ProtagonistA went inside and sat down in a pew 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and prayed 
 When ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes , ProtagonistA felt a sense of calm and peace 
 ProtagonistA got up and walked out of the cathedral 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would always remember this day 
ProtagonistA was in a deep sleep when ProtagonistA heard the words  ProtagonistB is dead 
  ProtagonistA slowly opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw ProtagonistB's dead body next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA started to scream as ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was going to be next 
ProtagonistA climbed down into the water , where ProtagonistA had been stripped of all ProtagonistA's clothing , and stood there , ProtagonistA's mind reeling 
 ProtagonistA had no idea what was going on , or why ProtagonistA was here 
 ProtagonistA looked around , trying to find some sort of clue as to what was going on , but there was nothing 
 ProtagonistA was completely alone 
 ProtagonistA started to feel panicky 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do or where to go 
 ProtagonistA started to swim around , hoping to find some sort of land or something , but ProtagonistA did n't 
 ProtagonistA started to tire , and ProtagonistA's panic turned into despair 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how long ProtagonistA had been swimming , but it felt like forever 
 ProtagonistA was so tired , and ProtagonistA could n't go on any longer 
 ProtagonistA started to sink , ProtagonistA's body giving up on ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA sunk down into the water , ProtagonistA saw a light 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what was happening , but ProtagonistA did n't fight it 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA being enveloped in the light , and then ProtagonistA was gone 
The first time ProtagonistB pulled ProtagonistA out of the park , ProtagonistA was in a tangle of newts , ProtagonistA's body in full view of the other newts 
 ProtagonistA was embarrassed and tried to cover ProtagonistA up , but ProtagonistB just laughed and said ProtagonistA was beautiful 
 ProtagonistA blushed and looked down , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel flattered 
ProtagonistA was frowning when ProtagonistA heard the blast , but ProtagonistA had n't seen anything yet 
 ProtagonistA was getting ready for bed when ProtagonistA heard it 
 ProtagonistA thought it was just a car backfiring , but when ProtagonistA looked out the window , ProtagonistA saw the flames 
 ProtagonistA quickly got dressed and grabbed ProtagonistA's purse , but ProtagonistA could n't find ProtagonistA's keys 
 ProtagonistA started to panic when ProtagonistA realized they were probably in the house 
 ProtagonistA tried to go back in , but the flames were too big 
 ProtagonistA started to cry when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA was going to lose everything 
ProtagonistA leaned into the glow of the fire , ProtagonistA's hands clasped behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA know exactly what she'm doing 
 ProtagonistA 'd been planning this for weeks , maybe even months 
 ProtagonistA had it all worked out in ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA had to do 
 But now , as ProtagonistA sat in front of the fire , ProtagonistA began to doubt ProtagonistA 
 What if ProtagonistA was making a mistake ? What if ProtagonistA could n't go through with it?No , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had to do this 
 ProtagonistA could n't back out now 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and steeled ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA would do this 
 ProtagonistA would not fail 
 And so , on that fateful day , ProtagonistA became the latest in a long line of brides to be married in that room 
 ProtagonistA could feel the weight of history on ProtagonistA's shoulders as ProtagonistA walked down the aisle , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would be creating new memories for ProtagonistA's own children and grandchildren to look back on one day 
 As ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's hand and pledged ProtagonistA's life to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and contentment settle over ProtagonistA 
Before ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistA's life to be the best it could be , and ProtagonistA knew that it would only be the best possible if ProtagonistA made it that way 
 ProtagonistA was determined to live ProtagonistA's life to the fullest and make every moment count 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be a role model for ProtagonistA's children and grandchildren , and ProtagonistA wanted to leave a legacy of love and happiness 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to make the most of ProtagonistA's time , and ProtagonistA did just that 
 ProtagonistA was an amazing wife , mother , grandmother , and friend , and ProtagonistA will be missed by all who knew ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB for the first time when ProtagonistA was eleven years old 
 ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB was really cute , but was too shy to say anything 
 When ProtagonistA turned eighteen , ProtagonistA finally mustered up the courage to tell ProtagonistB how ProtagonistA felt about ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA never knew the difference between December and any other month 
 ProtagonistA would go to church every Sunday , sit in the same pew , and sing the same songs 
 ProtagonistA never complained , because ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life 
 One day , ProtagonistA went to church and saw that the pews were empty 
 ProtagonistA thought that maybe everyone was just late , so ProtagonistA sat down and waited 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistA realized that no one was coming 
 ProtagonistA got up and walked to the front of the church , where ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB packing up ProtagonistB's things 
 Father , where is everyone ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA did n't understand what was happening 
 ProtagonistA had been coming to this church ProtagonistA's whole life , and now it was gone 
 ProtagonistA never forgot the church that ProtagonistA loved , but ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's new life 
ProtagonistA stood before ProtagonistB , and the breath was stilled before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it 
 ProtagonistA could feel the power emanating from ProtagonistB , and it was both exhilarating and terrifying 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB could crush ProtagonistA like a grape if ProtagonistB wanted to , and the thought made ProtagonistA's heart race 
 But ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistB would never hurt ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA could see the gentleness in ProtagonistB's eyes , and the way ProtagonistB's whole body was relaxed 
 But ProtagonistA stood ProtagonistA's ground and met ProtagonistB's gaze 
 Who are ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA have a destiny to fulfill 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say to that , so ProtagonistA just stood there and looked at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA must be tired after ProtagonistA's journey 
 Finally , ProtagonistA spoke 
 ProtagonistA do n't know what ProtagonistA's destiny is , but ProtagonistA will trust ProtagonistB 
 And with that , ProtagonistA fell into a deep sleep 
ProtagonistA had always been a powerful witch 
 ProtagonistA was never the same after that 
 ProtagonistA became a recluse and spent ProtagonistA's days mourning ProtagonistA's son 
ProtagonistA was a very curious girl 
 ProtagonistA always wanted to know what was around the next corner 
 So , when ProtagonistA saw a door that ProtagonistA had never seen before , ProtagonistA just had to go through it 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what was on the other side , but ProtagonistA was excited to find out 
 As ProtagonistA walked through the door , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a very strange place 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a giant 's house 
 As ProtagonistA continued to explore , ProtagonistA found more and more odd things 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it before 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's way back to the door ProtagonistA had come in 
 As ProtagonistA walked through , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA back in ProtagonistA's own house 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to find that everything was back to normal size 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what to make of ProtagonistA's experience 
 Was it all just a dream ? Or had ProtagonistA really been in a giant 's house ? ProtagonistA was n't sure , but one thing was for sure 
 ProtagonistA was definitely curious to find out 
Fourteen years ago , when ProtagonistA was conducting ProtagonistA's last examination of ProtagonistA's patients , ProtagonistA had an idea of what might befall ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was not sure what it was , but ProtagonistA knew it would be something terrible 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw a group of people huddled together in a doorway 
 ProtagonistA approached them and asked if they were okay 
 ProtagonistA was outraged 
 ProtagonistA asked them why the government was n't doing anything to help them 
 ProtagonistA promised them that ProtagonistA would do something to help them 
 ProtagonistA went to the nearest store and bought them some food and blankets 
 ProtagonistA then went to the city hall and demanded to speak to someone about the situation 
 ProtagonistA was satisfied and went home 
 ProtagonistA was always very adventurous , and loved to explore the world around ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB 
 Without hesitation , ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB down a rabbit hole , and found ProtagonistA in a place ProtagonistA had never seen before 
 ProtagonistA was amazed by all the new sights and sounds , and could n't wait to explore more of this new world 
ProtagonistA was a very pretty girl , with dark hair which fell to ProtagonistA's shoulders , a light complexion , strong eyebrows and a shining face 
 ProtagonistA was very popular at school and had many friends 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking home from school with ProtagonistA's friends when they saw a group of boys throwing stones at a cat 
 ProtagonistA's friends ran away , but ProtagonistA ran towards the boys and stopped them from harming the cat 
 ProtagonistA ran as fast as ProtagonistA could and managed to lose them 
 When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA was out of breath and ProtagonistA's heart was pounding 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had done the right thing , but ProtagonistA was also very scared 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the bed , and ProtagonistA looked up at the ceiling with a trembling hand 
 ProtagonistA was trying to process what had just happened , but ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA felt dirty and violated , and ProtagonistA wanted to take a shower but ProtagonistA was afraid that if ProtagonistA moved , the pain would get worse 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a nightmare , and ProtagonistA wished that ProtagonistA would wake up 
 But ProtagonistA knew that this was reality , and ProtagonistA had to face it 
 ProtagonistA was scared and alone , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA had been planning to do it for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had found out that ProtagonistB had been cheating on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA walked into the living room where ProtagonistB and child were watching TV and sat down next to them 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and said ,  ProtagonistA 'm leaving you 
 ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things and ProtagonistA's child 's things and left the house 
 ProtagonistA was finally free from ProtagonistA's unhappy marriage and could start fresh with ProtagonistA's child 
 ProtagonistA 's my best friend , and I know that I will always love ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA scooped ProtagonistB up and took ProtagonistB home , despite the protests of ProtagonistA's husband 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's husband searched for ProtagonistB for days , but they never found ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA has been a part of our lives for as long as we can remember 
 ProtagonistA has been a part of our lives for over 150 years now 
 ProtagonistA has been through all sorts of adventures , and ProtagonistA always manages to come out on top 
 ProtagonistA is a symbol of hope and resilience , and we will always love ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was going to have to kill ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA said , sitting on the arm of the chair and looking into ProtagonistB's eyes 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly , but ProtagonistA could n't let ProtagonistB live knowing what ProtagonistA knew 
 ProtagonistA did n't mind , though ; ProtagonistA was happy to have a place in ProtagonistB's court , and ProtagonistA enjoyed the challenge of keeping everything running smoothly 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking through the palace grounds when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the river 
 ProtagonistA went to investigate and saw a beautiful golden fish swimming upstream 
 ProtagonistA quickly scooped it up in ProtagonistA's net and brought it to the palace , where ProtagonistA put it in a tank of fresh water 
 First , ProtagonistA wished for the palace to be finished so that ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's ladies would have a comfortable home 
 Second , ProtagonistA wished for the servants to be well - trained and efficient , so that the palace would run like a well - oiled machine 
 And third , ProtagonistA wished for a never - ending supply of fresh fish for the tank 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's ladies would be happy there for many years to come 
 ProtagonistA is the only one who knows the secret of the museum 
 ProtagonistA discovered this when ProtagonistA was just a child 
 ProtagonistA would come to the museum and sit in front of the portal , and soon ProtagonistA would be transported to another world 
 ProtagonistA has been to many different worlds , and ProtagonistA has even made some friends in those worlds 
 But one day , ProtagonistA went to a world that was very different from all the others 
 ProtagonistA was scared , and ProtagonistA tried to run away , but the monsters were too fast 
 ProtagonistA does n't know what happened to ProtagonistA after that 
 ProtagonistA woke up in the museum , back in ProtagonistA's own world 
 But ProtagonistA was different now 
 ProtagonistA was older , and ProtagonistA had a feeling that ProtagonistA had been to that dark world before 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to go back and find ProtagonistA's friends 
 But first , ProtagonistA had to tell the secret of the museum to someone 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but feel different from all the other boys and girls 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do or where to go 
 One day , ProtagonistA ran away from home 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to find out who ProtagonistA really was 
 ProtagonistA ended up at a small cabin in the woods 
 It was there that ProtagonistA met a woman who told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was a witch 
 ProtagonistA was skeptical at first , but ProtagonistA decided to try it out 
 ProtagonistA turned into a bird and flew away 
 ProtagonistA felt free for the first time in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could never go back to being a boy , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA was finally happy and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never be alone again 
ProtagonistA was living a happy life , enjoying ProtagonistA's summer holidays with ProtagonistA's family and friends 
 ProtagonistA loved spending time with ProtagonistA's loved ones , and ProtagonistA cherished every moment ProtagonistA had with them 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was out playing with ProtagonistA's friends , ProtagonistA suddenly felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's chest 
 ProtagonistA clutched at ProtagonistA's chest and collapsed to the ground 
ProtagonistA woke up in ProtagonistA's bed , groggy and disoriented 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had been sleeping for hours , but ProtagonistA did n't know how long ProtagonistA had actually been out 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and walked to ProtagonistA's window 
 When ProtagonistA looked outside , ProtagonistA saw that it was evening 
 And then ProtagonistA heard the church bells ringing 
 ProtagonistA had never heard them ring so loudly before 
 ProtagonistA wondered what was going on 
 ProtagonistA got dressed and went outside to see if ProtagonistA could find out 
 When ProtagonistA got to the church , ProtagonistA saw that there was a wedding going on 
 ProtagonistA had never seen a wedding at the church before 
 ProtagonistA watched as the bride and groom said their vows and then kissed 
 ProtagonistA felt happy for them 
 As ProtagonistA was walking back home , ProtagonistA heard the bells ringing again 
 This time , ProtagonistA knew what they were saying 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB lived along the southern shore of an old lake in one of the smaller coves 
 ProtagonistA bore a very infamous , rather sordid remembrance of ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA stood at ProtagonistA's kitchen mirror , as if looking around the room for the first time 
 ProtagonistA saw the dirty dishes in the sink and the pile of laundry in the corner 
 ProtagonistA noticed the dust on the shelves and the cobwebs in the corners 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been neglecting ProtagonistA's home and it showed 
 ProtagonistA made a decision then and there to clean up ProtagonistA's act and start taking better care of ProtagonistA's home 
 From that day forward , ProtagonistA became a model housekeeper and ProtagonistA's home was always clean and tidy 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's husband Isaac Davis were like any other young couple in love 
ProtagonistA had always been a bright girl , and ProtagonistA's parents had high hopes for ProtagonistA's future 
 ProtagonistA was excited to leave ProtagonistA's small town and start a new chapter in ProtagonistA's life 
 But ProtagonistA had a secret 
 ProtagonistA had never told anyone about ProtagonistA's gift , for fear of being labelled a freak 
 But ProtagonistA knew that there was someone out there who would be interested in ProtagonistA's ability - ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was nervous about meeting ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that it was inevitable 
 One day , ProtagonistA would have to face ProtagonistB and reveal ProtagonistA's secret 
 Until then , ProtagonistA would keep ProtagonistA's ability hidden and enjoy ProtagonistA's time at boarding school 
ProtagonistA died when ProtagonistA's ears were bleeding 
 ProtagonistA was at a party and someone turned up the music too loud 
 The next thing ProtagonistA knew , ProtagonistA was lying on the ground with blood coming out of ProtagonistA's ears 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were having lunch at the upper end of the city 
 ProtagonistA agreed , but said that ProtagonistA sometimes felt like a fish out of water 
 ProtagonistA missed the small - town feel of ProtagonistA's hometown 
 ProtagonistA nodded , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little homesick 
Ever since the dark nights of the past , when ProtagonistA had been orphan and immature , and brought to the surface of madness by the combination of innocence with evil , the beautiful , innocent face of ProtagonistA , had been a source of terror to ProtagonistB , and perhaps to ProtagonistA , and one of the most uncertain and troublesome situations of childhood 
 ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's own in the world , and ProtagonistA had to face ProtagonistA's fears head on 
 ProtagonistA had to learn to control the darkness that seemed to well up inside ProtagonistA whenever ProtagonistA thought of those nights long ago 
 Slowly , ProtagonistA began to venture out after dark , and to ProtagonistA's surprise , nothing happened 
 ProtagonistA began to feel more confident , and ProtagonistA's green eyes no longer seemed to hold the same terror for ProtagonistA 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA came to accept that the darkness was a part of ProtagonistA , but it did n't have to control ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was in control now , and ProtagonistA could choose to face the darkness or to turn away from it 
 ProtagonistA was no longer a scared little girl , and ProtagonistA was no longer alone 
 ProtagonistA was smiling , and the sun felt its warmth spreading through its body 
ProtagonistA was a beautiful butterfly who loved to flutter around the Abirondack Mountains 
 ProtagonistA would often perch on the peaks of the mountains and take in the stunning views 
 On one particular day , ProtagonistA was enjoying the view from one of the peaks when ProtagonistA suddenly felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's wing 
 ProtagonistA looked down and saw that ProtagonistA's wing was ripped and ProtagonistA was bleeding 
 ProtagonistA tried to fly away but ProtagonistA's wing was too damaged 
 ProtagonistA ended up falling off the peak and into a deep ravine 
 ProtagonistA lay there for days , helpless and in pain 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA died from ProtagonistA's injuries 
 As ProtagonistA lay there dying , ProtagonistA shed ProtagonistA's wings on two of the peaks of the Abirondack Mountains 
ProtagonistA was a beautiful and purring one , with a bright , clear face and a wary look in ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA was always on the lookout for danger , and ProtagonistA was always ready to protect ProtagonistA's family 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking when ProtagonistA saw a group of dogs coming towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA immediately went into protect mode , and ProtagonistA fought them off until they finally ran away 
ProtagonistA was a very old and very wretched woman , and one of the most detestable characters in the country ; but in my opinion , among all women , ProtagonistA was the most infamous 
 ProtagonistA had been married to a man who was much older than ProtagonistA , and who had died about ten years ago 
 Since his death ProtagonistA had lived a life of seclusion , and had never been seen by any of ProtagonistA's neighbors 
 ProtagonistA was a tall , thin woman , with a face that was deeply wrinkled and a complexion that was almost black 
 ProtagonistA was a large , imposing figure , and ProtagonistA's presence was felt by all who entered 
 ProtagonistA was a woman of great strength and power , and ProtagonistA used ProtagonistA's ghostly form to protect those who could not protect themselves 
 ProtagonistA was a force to be reckoned with , and ProtagonistA's enemies knew it 
ProtagonistA is sitting in ProtagonistA's bedroom on a hot summer day in July , trying to decide whether it 's worth while to go to a country inn or an ailing old lady 's house and die in the cold and damp 
 ProtagonistA 's not sure what to do , but ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA ca n't stay in ProtagonistA's stuffy , hot bedroom any longer 
 ProtagonistA gets up and goes to the window , looking out at the beautiful day 
 ProtagonistA sees people walking and biking around and children playing in the park 
 ProtagonistA hears the sound of laughter and the splashing of water 
 ProtagonistA suddenly knows what ProtagonistA wants to do 
 ProtagonistA grabs ProtagonistA's purse and keys and heads out the door , heading for the park 
 ProtagonistA 's going to enjoy ProtagonistA last day , no matter what happens 
ProtagonistA had once left a large sum of money and ProtagonistA's house in London for the purpose of making a new life for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had wanted a man who would be faithful to ProtagonistA in the world 
 ProtagonistA had met many men , but none of them had been the right one 
 ProtagonistA had almost given up hope , when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had given up everything for ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB had betrayed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA left ProtagonistB and moved back to London 
 ProtagonistA never wanted to see ProtagonistB again 
ProtagonistA was a mother 's lady and ProtagonistA's daughter was the nicest girl in the world 
 ProtagonistA went to the store and found ProtagonistA's daughter dead 
 ProtagonistA had always suspected that ProtagonistB was something otherworldly , but ProtagonistA never could have guessed that ProtagonistB was a bloodsucking fiend 
 ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and snuck out while ProtagonistB was sleeping 
ProtagonistA was having a great day 
 ProtagonistA learned about the universe and how it worked 
 ProtagonistA saw the stars and planets moving and was fascinated by it all 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt something was wrong with ProtagonistA's soul 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what it was , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to find out 
 ProtagonistA went on a journey to find the answer and eventually found it 
 ProtagonistA learned that ProtagonistA's soul was sick because ProtagonistA was living in a world that was full of hate and violence 
 ProtagonistA decided to change ProtagonistA's ways and make a difference in the world 
The last time they saw each other , ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's seventh year 
 ProtagonistA had just finished ProtagonistA's shift at the factory and was on ProtagonistA's way home when ProtagonistA saw a group of kids playing in the snow 
 ProtagonistA stopped to help ProtagonistB , and when ProtagonistA was done , ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a big hug 
 ProtagonistA never forgot that day , and every year on the anniversary of it , ProtagonistA would go back to that same spot and build a snowman with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA came to my house on Tuesday to tell me the news that ProtagonistB had been admitted into the College of the Holy McPherson Priory 
 ProtagonistA said that it would be five years before ProtagonistB would be able to see ProtagonistB's aunt 
ProtagonistA had been feeling off for weeks 
 ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that something was wrong , but ProtagonistA could n't put ProtagonistA's finger on what it was 
 And then , one day , ProtagonistA woke up to find that three inches of ProtagonistA's nose was gone 
 ProtagonistA panicked , of course , but ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA could n't go to the hospital , because ProtagonistA did n't want to explain what had happened 
 And ProtagonistA could n't just leave it as it was 
 So ProtagonistA did the only thing ProtagonistA could think of : ProtagonistA went to a plastic surgeon and had them fix ProtagonistA's nose 
ProtagonistA was in the kitchen about that time , knitting a scarf for ProtagonistB , when ProtagonistA noticed a shadow sitting on the table 
 ProtagonistA had never seen a shadow like this before , and ProtagonistA was wondering what it was doing in ProtagonistA's kitchen 
 ProtagonistA watched it for a while , but ProtagonistA soon got back to ProtagonistA's knitting 
 A few minutes later , ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the living room 
 ProtagonistA got up to see what was going on and found the shadow in the living room , knocking over a lamp 
 Hey ! What are you doing ?  ProtagonistA exclaimed 
 ProtagonistA chased it , but it was too fast for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it before 
 ProtagonistA was about to go back to the living room to clean up the mess when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB coming home 
 I'm in the kitchen !  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA quickly finished knitting the scarf and went to meet ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't mention the shadow to ProtagonistB , as ProtagonistA was n't sure what to make of it 
 ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's parlor , chatting with ProtagonistA's neighbor , when ProtagonistA suddenly remembered that ProtagonistA had to choose a subject of conversation for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA decided to ask ProtagonistB about the world 's greatest chocolate connoisseur of the nineteenth century , Mr
 Just as ProtagonistA was about to begin ProtagonistA's inquiry , ProtagonistA heard a loud banging on ProtagonistA's door 
 ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and found ProtagonistC standing there , brandishing a revolver 
 ProtagonistA slammed the door shut and ran to the nearest telephone to call the police 
The first time I had the good fortune to see ProtagonistA grow old , ProtagonistA was as beautiful as a goddess 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a white dress that flowed around ProtagonistA like a cloud 
 ProtagonistA was so beautiful that I could n't take my eyes off ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was kind and wise , and I felt honored to be able to talk to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had just moved to a new town and was starting ProtagonistA's first day of school 
 ProtagonistA was feeling nervous and out of place when ProtagonistA saw a group of kids laughing and pointing at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA tried to ignore them , but ProtagonistA could feel the tears welling up in ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA was about to turn and run away when ProtagonistA heard someone call ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA will always be grateful to ProtagonistB for being ProtagonistA's friend when ProtagonistA needed it most 
 ProtagonistA knew that I would have to face the world alone , and that I would need all the strength I could muster 
 ProtagonistA also knew that I would find a way to make it through , because I was strong enough to weather any storm 
  ProtagonistA knew it was meant as a term of respect , but it made ProtagonistA feel old and stuffy 
 Finally , ProtagonistA decided to say something 
 ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would appreciate it if ProtagonistB would stop calling ProtagonistA ' Madam 
ProtagonistA flung open the white door of ProtagonistA's kitchen and directed the astonished man in the line to the dining room 
 ProtagonistA had been expecting ProtagonistB all day and was not going to let ProtagonistB get away this time 
 ProtagonistA had been tracking ProtagonistB's every move and knew that ProtagonistB would be coming to ProtagonistA's house 
 ProtagonistA was not going to let ProtagonistB get away with what ProtagonistB had done 
Not long after ProtagonistA was born , ProtagonistA had a dream 
 In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA was a beautiful butterfly , flitting from flower to flower 
 ProtagonistA was so happy and free , and ProtagonistA knew that this was what ProtagonistA was meant to do 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was sad to find that ProtagonistA was just a regular girl , but ProtagonistA was determined to make ProtagonistA's dream come true 
 ProtagonistA worked hard to learn about butterflies , and eventually ProtagonistA became a world - renowned butterfly expert 
 ProtagonistA even wrote a book about it ! Now ProtagonistA knows that anything is possible if you believe in yourself and follow your dreams 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who knew what ProtagonistA wanted in life , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to get it 
 ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer , and ProtagonistA wanted to be a writer 
 ProtagonistA had read all the great classics and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could write something just as good , if not better 
 But ProtagonistA did n't know how to get started 
 ProtagonistA did n't have any ideas for stories , and ProtagonistA did n't know how to go about getting published 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking in the park and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on a bench , writing in a notebook 
 ProtagonistA went up to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB was writing 
 ProtagonistA went home and started writing ProtagonistA's first story 
 ProtagonistA was a little unsure at first , but ProtagonistA kept going and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA's rhythm 
 ProtagonistA wrote and wrote until ProtagonistA had a complete story 
 Then ProtagonistA sent it off to a publisher 
 ProtagonistA was so excited when ProtagonistA got a letter back saying that they wanted to publish ProtagonistA's story 
 ProtagonistA was finally a published author 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA wanted to be a writer , and ProtagonistA finally achieved ProtagonistA's dream 
ProtagonistA was a stranger , and a stranger that ProtagonistA was , if ProtagonistA had been anything like any other woman of flesh or blood 
 ProtagonistA was different than any other woman that ProtagonistB had ever met 
 ProtagonistA was beautiful and intriguing , and ProtagonistB could n't help but be drawn to ProtagonistA 
 Three months later , ProtagonistA was dead 
 But ProtagonistA was a strong girl , and ProtagonistA refused to let ProtagonistB break ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was named after the gods , and that made ProtagonistA special 
 And ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistC was named after the earth , and that made ProtagonistC special too 
 Even though ProtagonistA's life was hard , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could make it through anything 
Nearly two hours after ProtagonistA had set out on ProtagonistA's journey to the far - away city of St
 Louis , ProtagonistA arrived at the eastern gate of the town 
 ProtagonistA still had to find a place to stay for the night and figure out how to get to ProtagonistA's destination 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB for directions to the nearest inn , and ProtagonistB pointed ProtagonistA in the right direction 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and set off down the street 
 As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA passed by many shops and homes , all of which were bustling with activity 
 ProtagonistA had never seen a town this big before , and ProtagonistA was feeling a bit overwhelmed 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw that ProtagonistB was pointing at a large sign that read  No Entry after Sunset 
  ProtagonistA had forgotten all about the curfew ! ProtagonistA quickly thanked ProtagonistB again and rushed to the inn , hoping ProtagonistA would make it there before the curfew 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a rebel 
 ProtagonistA was never one to follow the crowd and ProtagonistA always marched to the beat of ProtagonistA's own drum 
 So , when ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's small town in Maine to go to college in Boston , ProtagonistA did n't think twice about it 
 ProtagonistA had never been away from home for more than a weekend , so ProtagonistA was a bit nervous as the train pulled into the station 
 But ProtagonistA quickly made ProtagonistA's way through the crowds and found ProtagonistA's way to ProtagonistA's new dorm 
 ProtagonistA loved the freedom of being on ProtagonistA's own and the excitement of the city 
 ProtagonistA quickly made friends and started exploring all that Boston had to offer 
 ProtagonistA learned a lot , both inside and outside of the classroom 
 ProtagonistA also grew a lot as a person 
 ProtagonistA was more confident and independent than ever before 
 Looking back , ProtagonistA is glad that ProtagonistA took the leap and moved to Boston 
ProtagonistA was sixteen and in love 
 And ProtagonistA was going to have to kill someone 
 ProtagonistA's love was worth more than anything else in the world , and ProtagonistA was willing to do whatever it took to protect it 
 ProtagonistA had planned everything out perfectly 
 ProtagonistA would wait until ProtagonistA's victim was alone , and then ProtagonistA would strike 
 ProtagonistA was confident in ProtagonistA's ability to do this 
 ProtagonistA thought about it for a long time , and eventually settled on the person who ProtagonistA thought was the biggest threat to ProtagonistA's relationship 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to go through with it , but ProtagonistA was still scared 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and steadied ProtagonistA before making ProtagonistA's move 
 ProtagonistA snuck up behind them and struck quickly and efficiently 
 ProtagonistA felt a wave of relief wash over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had done it 
 ProtagonistA had protected ProtagonistA's love , and now nothing could come between them 
 ProtagonistA was willing to do whatever it took to keep ProtagonistA's relationship safe , even if it meant taking a life 
ProtagonistA was a good and kind woman , and as such ProtagonistA would not have anything to do with a sick man 
 ProtagonistA was content to live a life of solitude , only interacting with others when absolutely necessary 
 ProtagonistA hesitated , but ProtagonistA's kind heart won out and ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB in 
 ProtagonistA nursed ProtagonistB back to health , and in the process , fell in love with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA learned that sometimes the best things in life come from those we least expect it 
ProtagonistA had been sitting in the cart behind the house for hours , but ProtagonistA had kept ProtagonistA's eyes on the horses , which were galloping along at a good clip 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be coming home soon and ProtagonistA wanted to be ready to greet ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was getting a little bit tired , but ProtagonistA did n't want to miss ProtagonistA's chance to see ProtagonistB 
 Finally , ProtagonistA saw the horses coming around the bend in the road and ProtagonistA jumped up , waving ProtagonistA's arms 
ProtagonistA was never a fan of birds 
 ProtagonistA found them to be dirty and noisy creatures 
 So , when ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to take care of the three rooks while ProtagonistB was away , ProtagonistA reluctantly agreed 
 ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to take care of the birds , but ProtagonistA was never really comfortable around them 
 ProtagonistA would often find them staring at ProtagonistA with their beady eyes , as if they were judging ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA panicked and tried to catch the bird , but it was too fast 
 ProtagonistA watched as the bird flew away , wondering if ProtagonistA would ever see it again 
 ProtagonistA felt guilty and vowed to do better 
 ProtagonistA started paying more attention to the birds and soon developed a bond with them 
 ProtagonistA even started to enjoy their company 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA 'd killed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't mean to do it 
 But now that ProtagonistB was gone , ProtagonistA realized how much ProtagonistA depended on ProtagonistB 
 Without ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was nothing 
 ProtagonistA was nothing without ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA stood up from ProtagonistA's chair and leaned forward , ProtagonistA's head leaned forward and ProtagonistA's hands clasped across ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA was trying to make sense of what ProtagonistA had just seen 
 Was it really a rabbit ? And if so , why was it wearing a waistcoat ? ProtagonistA had never seen a rabbit like that before 
 ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA just stood there , staring after the rabbit 
 Then ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was late for ProtagonistA's own date 
 ProtagonistA quickly grabbed ProtagonistA's things and ran out the door 
 ProtagonistA never did find out what that rabbit was up to , but ProtagonistA always wondered if ProtagonistA would see it again 
ProtagonistA was in the midst of the courtyard around ProtagonistA's apartment 
 ProtagonistA had just finished ProtagonistA's morning jog and was now stretching ProtagonistA's muscles 
 As ProtagonistA bent down to touch ProtagonistA's toes , ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around to see a large , black rat scurry away 
 ProtagonistA shuddered and quickly finished ProtagonistA's stretches before going inside 
ProtagonistA sighed as ProtagonistA looked around ProtagonistA's grey , smoggy neighbourhood 
 ProtagonistA missed the days when ProtagonistA could sit in ProtagonistA's front yard and admire the view 
 Now , all ProtagonistA could see was a sea of concrete and metal 
 ProtagonistA stared into ProtagonistA's garden pond , imagining a world without smog 
 In ProtagonistA's mind , ProtagonistA could see the blue skies and the bright sun 
 ProtagonistA could feel the warmth of the sun on ProtagonistA's skin and the freshness of the air 
 ProtagonistA was so happy and excited to have a new baby in the family 
The last night ProtagonistA had been on earth , ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA had a dream where ProtagonistA was just a girl and ProtagonistA was walking along in the garden , and suddenly a great wickedness smote ProtagonistA , and - now this is scary ! - and ProtagonistA was flying 
 In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA saw the most beautiful creatures ProtagonistA had ever seen , and they were flying too 
 They were flying towards a great light , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was flying towards the light too 
 Then ProtagonistA woke up 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful baby girl with big blue eyes and a head of curly blond hair 
 ProtagonistA was a happy and healthy child who loved to play and explore 
 ProtagonistA was always curious about the world around ProtagonistA and loved to ask questions 
 As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA continued to be a bright and inquisitive young lady 
 ProtagonistA was an excellent student and was always eager to learn new things 
 When ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB settled down in a lovely house in the countryside 
 ProtagonistA was a devoted wife and mother and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's family very much 
 ProtagonistA was a kind , caring , and loving person who was taken from this world far too soon 
 On ProtagonistA's deathbed , ProtagonistA had given permission for ProtagonistB to live in the room where ProtagonistB was born , and so that is where ProtagonistB was living now 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the bed , looking at ProtagonistA in the mirror 
 ProtagonistA looked like a princess 
 ProtagonistA was so beautiful 
 But ProtagonistA did n't feel beautiful 
 ProtagonistA felt like a fraud 
 ProtagonistA was pretending to be something ProtagonistA was n't 
 ProtagonistA was pretending to be happy 
 But ProtagonistA was n't happy 
 ProtagonistA was miserable 
 ProtagonistA hated ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could just disappear 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could just disappear and never be seen again 
ProtagonistA rode ProtagonistA's yellow horse through the desert , ProtagonistA's destiny unknown to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA came across an old city , its walls and towers still standing , but the air and roads were trembling 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA's destiny was waiting for ProtagonistA in this city 
ProtagonistA had a really long way to go to reach the point when ProtagonistA could step into the kitchen without looking over ProtagonistA's shoulder 
 ProtagonistA had been living in fear for so long , always looking over ProtagonistA's shoulder , always wondering when the other shoe was going to drop 
 But finally , after years of therapy and hard work , ProtagonistA was starting to feel like maybe , just maybe , ProtagonistA could let ProtagonistA guard down a little bit 
ProtagonistA was getting ProtagonistB ready for college 
 ProtagonistA was excited for ProtagonistB to start this new chapter in ProtagonistB's life , but ProtagonistA was also going to miss ProtagonistB terribly 
 As ProtagonistA waded through the mud , ProtagonistA could n't help but think of all the memories they had made together 
 ProtagonistA was going to miss ProtagonistB's laughter , but ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was going to do great things 
ProtagonistA had been dreaming for more than two years , and right now the thought that ProtagonistA would have to die thrilled ProtagonistA more than anything else 
 ProtagonistA was ready to die , to leave this world behind and enter the next 
 ProtagonistA had been dreaming of the moment ProtagonistA would die for so long , and now it was finally here 
 ProtagonistA was excited to see what would happen next , to see what the afterlife would be like 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let out a deep breath as ProtagonistA died 
ProtagonistA is a bully , is n't ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistA 's always picking on other kids and making them feel bad about themselves 
 But what ProtagonistA's victims do n't realize is that ProtagonistA is actually just a big scaredy - cat 
 ProtagonistA 's scared of what other people think of ProtagonistA , so ProtagonistA tries to make them think ProtagonistA 's better than them 
 But deep down , ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA 's not really a bully 
 ProtagonistA 's just a scared little girl 
It was a hot day , said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA sat down at the table in the dining - room , which was in the middle of the house 
 ProtagonistA felt as though ProtagonistA could barely breathe 
 ProtagonistA fanning ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's hand , but it did little to alleviate the heat 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB then sat down and began to enjoy their meal 
 ProtagonistA was grateful for the relief from the heat and was soon able to forget about the oppressive heat outside 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful woman with long dark hair and piercing blue eyes 
 ProtagonistA wore a simple white dress that flowed down to ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistA was barefoot 
 ProtagonistA walked into the court and ProtagonistB immediately ordered ProtagonistB's guards to seize ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA simply replied that ProtagonistA was a messenger from ProtagonistC and that ProtagonistA had come to deliver a message to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistC had seen the way ProtagonistB had been ruling the empire and that ProtagonistC was not pleased 
 ProtagonistA warned ProtagonistB that unless ProtagonistB changed ProtagonistB's ways , ProtagonistC would bring down ProtagonistC's wrath upon ProtagonistB and the empire 
 As ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistB and smiled 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's message would be delivered , even if it cost ProtagonistA ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA lay for some minutes on the river bank , babbling in the shallow water of the river while the great army of the Lō̏kampans swept towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a small child , and the Lōkampans were a fearsome people 
 ProtagonistA was terrified , but ProtagonistA could not bring ProtagonistA to move 
 ProtagonistA lay there , trembling , as the Lōkampans approached 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA was safe , but ProtagonistA's village had been destroyed 
 ProtagonistA would never forget the terror ProtagonistA felt that day , as ProtagonistA lay on the river bank , waiting for the Lōkampans to find ProtagonistA 
In those days there was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was a good , honest man , and a man of sense , and ProtagonistA knew what was good for ProtagonistA ; and ProtagonistA was called Adam , and ProtagonistA was wise 
 And ProtagonistA had two daughters , and the one was called Eve , and the other was called Lilith 
ProtagonistA was a weak old woman , but ProtagonistA had a good mind 
 ProtagonistA was always thinking about the world and how it worked 
 ProtagonistA was curious about everything and wanted to know more 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to ask ProtagonistB about the world 
  ProtagonistB , how does the world work ?  ProtagonistA asked 
   That 's amazing !  ProtagonistA exclaimed 
 ProtagonistA became a laughing - stock in ProtagonistA's community , and no one would talk to ProtagonistA 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA became so despondent that ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's own life 
 ProtagonistA am sure you must be very lonely without ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA long to see you again 
 ProtagonistA am sure you will be glad to hear that ProtagonistA am coming home soon 
 ProtagonistA will write again when ProtagonistA have fixed the date 
 ProtagonistA am sure you will be interested to hear that ProtagonistA have been corresponding with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA am sure you will be as pleased as ProtagonistA was to hear that ProtagonistB has promised to help ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's work 
 ProtagonistA am sure you will be as pleased as ProtagonistA am to hear that ProtagonistA have been appointed as ProtagonistB's personal adviser , and that ProtagonistA am to be a member of ProtagonistB's Privy Council 
 ProtagonistA am sure you will be as proud of ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA am of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA hope that you will come and visit ProtagonistA soon , so that we can celebrate ProtagonistA's good fortune together 
 ProtagonistA was always a bit of a mystery to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was always doing things that did n't seem to make any sense , and yet , ProtagonistA always managed to come out on top 
 One day , ProtagonistA came to ProtagonistB with a problem 
 ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA do n't know what to do ,  ProtagonistA said 
 And sure enough , ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA figured out a way to help ProtagonistC and everything worked out in the end 
 As always , ProtagonistA had come out on top 
ProtagonistA was a fourth year Muggleborn , and had , as such , come to the city of London on the last leg of ProtagonistA's journey from the Gringotts bank 
 ProtagonistA was not expecting the city to be so 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it 
 As ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way through the crowds , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little out of place 
 ProtagonistA was used to the small village ProtagonistA grew up in , where everyone knew each other 
 Here , ProtagonistA felt like just another face in the crowd 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's way to the wizarding school ProtagonistA would be attending , and ProtagonistA's nerves began to settle 
 ProtagonistA was excited to start this new chapter in ProtagonistA's life 
 As ProtagonistA entered the school , ProtagonistA could n't help but wonder what the future held for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was determined to make the most of ProtagonistA's time here , and to learn as much as ProtagonistA could 
ProtagonistA had never been the kind of person to take risks 
 ProtagonistA had always played it safe , doing what was expected of ProtagonistA 
 But when ProtagonistA turned forty , ProtagonistA decided it was time for a change 
 ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's job , sold ProtagonistA's house , and bought a one - way ticket to Europe 
 For the first time in ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA was truly free 
 ProtagonistA traveled to all the places ProtagonistA had always dreamed of visiting , and ProtagonistA met so many interesting people along the way 
 ProtagonistA even fell in love 
 ProtagonistA had always thought that life was supposed to be a certain way , but ProtagonistA realized that there was so much more to it than ProtagonistA had ever imagined 
 ProtagonistA was finally living ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA was loving every minute of it 
ProtagonistA was a brilliant boy 
 ProtagonistA was always top of ProtagonistA's class and knew all the answers to the teacher 's questions 
 ProtagonistA was also always first to volunteer for anything 
 When the other kids in ProtagonistA's class needed help , ProtagonistA was always there to help them 
 ProtagonistA was a true leader 
 Even though ProtagonistA 's not a pureblood , and even though ProtagonistA 's not as wealthy as some of the other students , ProtagonistA feels at home there 
ProtagonistA was running away from the angry mob that was chasing ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was running as fast as ProtagonistA could , but ProtagonistA was getting tired 
 ProtagonistA saw the cairn wall up ahead and knew that ProtagonistA would never make it over in time 
 At the moment when ProtagonistA was about to collide with the ground , ProtagonistA burst through the cairn wall , leapt back , and dropped dead 
ProtagonistA was more than thirty - eight years old when ProtagonistA first put pen to paper 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to write a book , but never had the time 
 Now that ProtagonistA was retired , ProtagonistA finally had the time to pursue ProtagonistA's dream 
 ProtagonistA was a little nervous , but excited to start writing ProtagonistA's first novel 
 ProtagonistA had a lot of ideas for ProtagonistA's book , but ProtagonistA was n't sure where to start 
 ProtagonistA decided to just start writing and see where ProtagonistA's story took ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was surprised at how quickly the words flowed from ProtagonistA's pen 
 ProtagonistA had always loved writing , but never realized how much ProtagonistA enjoyed it 
 Before ProtagonistA knew it , ProtagonistA had written several chapters of ProtagonistA's book 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to see ProtagonistA's dream becoming a reality 
 ProtagonistA could n't wait to share ProtagonistA's book with the world 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who lived in a small town 
 ProtagonistA was a happy girl who loved to play with ProtagonistA's friends 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know why ProtagonistB was different , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA liked ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA happy 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was scared of ProtagonistB but ProtagonistA still loved ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was the only one who survived 
 ProtagonistA was the only one who could stop ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA confronted ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who was searching for something more in life 
 ProtagonistA had always been a spiritual person , but ProtagonistA felt like there was something more out there for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had read about the transfiguration and it sounded like something that could be perfect for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA began ProtagonistA's journey to find the transfiguration 
 ProtagonistA went to many different places and talked to many different people 
 Finally , ProtagonistA found someone who could help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was excited to begin ProtagonistA's journey to the transfiguration 
 ProtagonistA meditated and prayed and did everything ProtagonistA could to prepare ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA entered into a deep meditative state and soon found ProtagonistA in a state of perfect felicity 
 ProtagonistA felt a divine presence and knew that ProtagonistA had attained the transfiguration 
 ProtagonistA is able to conduct ProtagonistA's life in an extraordinary way and is inspired by a higher power 
 ProtagonistA is able to help others find their own path to the transfiguration and is a true inspiration to all who meet ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA loved to read , take care of things , and get along with people 
 However , ProtagonistA also loved having time to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA always made sure to take care of ProtagonistA's own happiness 
 ProtagonistA was always content knowing ProtagonistA had a good life 
 After ProtagonistA graduated , ProtagonistA attended the Royal College of the Healing Arts in London 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who loved to explore 
 ProtagonistA was always curious about the world around ProtagonistA and loved to ask questions 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole and decided to follow it 
 ProtagonistA ended up in ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had many adventures in ProtagonistB and made many new friends 
 ProtagonistA eventually found ProtagonistA's way back home and was very excited to tell ProtagonistA's family and friends about ProtagonistA's adventures 
Once , ProtagonistA was n't sure ProtagonistA wanted to be a wizard and then believe what ProtagonistA was told 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a skeptic , so when ProtagonistA was approached by ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was n't sure ProtagonistA believed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA decided to become a wizard and learn all ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA has never regretted ProtagonistA's decision and has become one of the most powerful wizards in the world 
ProtagonistA always made a big production out of tea time 
 ProtagonistA would pour cup after cup of tea for the household and the servants 
 ProtagonistA was always so graceful and elegant 
 ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB poured cup after cup of tea 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistA started to clap 
The last time I saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was a short , sallow - faced young man with hair like the top of ProtagonistA's head , and a goatee as big as ProtagonistA was broad 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a pair of overalls and a plaid shirt , and ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA was ready to work on a farm 
 I always thought ProtagonistA was a bit weird , and I guess ProtagonistA thought the same about me 
 But then , ProtagonistA started to change 
 ProtagonistA stopped hanging out with ProtagonistA's other friends , and ProtagonistA started to dress differently 
 And then , one day , ProtagonistA showed up to school looking like a completely different person 
ProtagonistA has been going to the library since ProtagonistA was a little girl 
 ProtagonistA loves the smell of the books and the way the light shines in through the windows 
 ProtagonistA spends ProtagonistA's days exploring the stacks and reading whatever catches ProtagonistA's eye 
ProtagonistA , took up residence in a large house in the center of Alexandria in 1659 
 ProtagonistA was the daughter of a good family and had been raised to be a proper lady 
 However , ProtagonistA had a rebellious streak and ProtagonistA yearned for adventure 
 So , instead of staying home and getting married like ProtagonistA's parents wanted , ProtagonistA took up residence in the city 
 ProtagonistA quickly learned that living in the city was not as glamorous as ProtagonistA had thought 
 ProtagonistA had to be careful not to go out alone at night 
 But ProtagonistA loved the freedom and the excitement of city life 
 ProtagonistA was terrified , but ProtagonistA refused to give them what they wanted 
 ProtagonistA collapsed to the ground , bleeding to death 
 As ProtagonistA lay there dying , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been foolish to think that the city was anything other than a dangerous place 
 ProtagonistA should have listened to ProtagonistA's parents and stayed home where it was safe 
ProtagonistA's name was Chester , and ProtagonistA was thirty - four years old 
 ProtagonistA worked as a secretary for a small law firm 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life , but ProtagonistA sometimes felt like ProtagonistA was missing something 
 One day , ProtagonistA came home from work and found ProtagonistB in the kitchen , cooking dinner 
 ProtagonistA was surprised , as ProtagonistB usually left that task to ProtagonistA 
 Mark , what are ProtagonistB doing ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA was soon asleep , and ProtagonistB turned off the television and woke ProtagonistA up 
 What is it ?  ProtagonistA asked , sleepily 
 ProtagonistA cried and begged ProtagonistB to stay , but ProtagonistB was adamant 
 ProtagonistA had to be strong for them , though ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was falling apart on the inside 
 ProtagonistA went to work and took care of ProtagonistA's children the best ProtagonistA could 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA started dating again 
 ProtagonistA found someone who made ProtagonistA feel happy and whole again 
 ProtagonistA was finally able to move on from ProtagonistA's failed marriage and create a new life for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been preparing for this moment for weeks , and ProtagonistA was not going to let anything stop ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA walked confidently to ProtagonistB and asked for ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and made ProtagonistA's way to the office 
 ProtagonistA could feel the eyes of the people around ProtagonistA on ProtagonistA's back , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA had a job to do 
 When ProtagonistA entered the office , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA walked up to the desk and sat down in the chair opposite ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA looked ProtagonistC in the eye and said ,  ProtagonistA 'm here to talk to ProtagonistC about the job 
  ProtagonistA could feel the anger rising up inside of ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA forced ProtagonistA to stay calm 
  May ProtagonistA ask why ?  ProtagonistA asked 
  ProtagonistA stood up and walked out of the office 
 ProtagonistA was not going to give up that easily 
 ProtagonistA would find another way into that company , and ProtagonistA would get the job 
 When they placed ProtagonistA inside , ProtagonistA could barely move an inch 
ProtagonistA had been walking ProtagonistA's entire life 
 ProtagonistA was seventeen , ProtagonistA had a job , and ProtagonistA was going to go to Hogwarts 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a wizard , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to get ProtagonistA's chance 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA could barely contain ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA was n't very good at magic 
 ProtagonistA considered giving up and going home , but ProtagonistA did n't want to quit 
 ProtagonistA wanted to prove to ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could do it 
 So , ProtagonistA kept going and eventually started to improve 
 By the end of ProtagonistA's seventh year , ProtagonistA was one of the top students in ProtagonistA's class 
 ProtagonistA had made some great friends and was proud of what ProtagonistA had accomplished 
ProtagonistA was a lanky seventeen - year - old when ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's village for the farm 
 ProtagonistA was very faithful to ProtagonistA's goal , even though it was difficult 
 ProtagonistA always had in mind that ProtagonistA ought to be a farmer , even though ProtagonistA might have to starve 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a troublemaker 
 On the very day the world was to begin to change , ProtagonistA did the most ridiculous thing that ever happened to ProtagonistA , and that is to have succeeded in changing the most important meeting of the village house into a hideous pantomime of torture , murder , and mayhem 
 ProtagonistA spent the rest of ProtagonistA's days there , wondering what could have been if ProtagonistA had just behaved ProtagonistA 
Not long ago ProtagonistA came at last to ProtagonistA's senses , and thought that ProtagonistA must be out of a job 
 ProtagonistA had been working at the same company for years , and had never once thought to question ProtagonistA's position 
 But now , after years of faithful service , ProtagonistA was finally starting to realize that ProtagonistA was being taken advantage of 
 Finally , ProtagonistA decided to speak up for ProtagonistA and demand better treatment 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB and told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was quitting 
 ProtagonistB was shocked , and tried to convince ProtagonistA to stay , but ProtagonistA was firm 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA deserved better , and ProtagonistA was going to find a job that would treat ProtagonistA right 
There was once a man who was well known , and known very well , for the one thing ProtagonistA had in common with every other man in the world , though ProtagonistA did not know it at the time ProtagonistA was doing what every other man in the world did , ProtagonistA had in common with the man who was named Thomas , with the same qualifications , and quite at the same time , however , ProtagonistA possessed some things which no man in the world possessed : ProtagonistA had both the good and the bad of the human species ; and there is no one who finds more good in human nature than the man who has done no other good than what ProtagonistA had done on ProtagonistA's own account , but had done it all on the goodwill of ProtagonistA's country and ProtagonistA's countrymen 
ProtagonistA was always a little too young to know what ProtagonistA really wanted , that was , except perhaps to know what ProtagonistA was really afraid of 
 ProtagonistA was afraid of the dark , of course , and of the monsters that might be lurking in it 
 But ProtagonistA was also afraid of the light , of the sun and the moon and the stars 
 ProtagonistA was afraid of the sky , of the clouds , of the wind 
 ProtagonistA was afraid of the world , and of the people in it 
 ProtagonistA was afraid of ProtagonistA , and of the things ProtagonistA might do 
If all ProtagonistA had ever wanted was a happy ending , ProtagonistA would have taken it 
 But ProtagonistA wanted more than that 
 ProtagonistA wanted an adventure 
 And so , ProtagonistA went off into the world , searching for new experiences 
 ProtagonistA met new people and saw new places 
 And , eventually , ProtagonistA found what ProtagonistA was looking for 
 ProtagonistA's happy ending 
ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB 
 It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever seen ProtagonistB smile like that and ProtagonistA wondered what ProtagonistB had been up to 
 ProtagonistA was about to ask ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA's mother came into the room and asked what they were doing 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to go , but ProtagonistB said it was time for bed 
 ProtagonistA reluctantly went to ProtagonistA's room and lay down , but ProtagonistA could n't sleep 
 ProtagonistA kept thinking about ProtagonistB's smile and what it could mean 
ProtagonistA was always a very curious child 
 When ProtagonistA was little , ProtagonistA was always asking questions and exploring ProtagonistA's surroundings 
 ProtagonistA had a great imagination and was always coming up with new ideas 
 ProtagonistA was a bright child who loved to learn 
ProtagonistA , of course , corrects the usual scale , does not include the perils of infancy , such as the dread of drowning ; but there is no doubt that , all things considered , ProtagonistA is an individual of prodigious intelligence 
 ProtagonistA is , in fact , so intelligent that ProtagonistA is able to understand and solve problems that are far beyond the scope of most people 
 For example , ProtagonistA is able to solve complex mathematical problems in ProtagonistA's head , something that most people would need a calculator for 
 Additionally , ProtagonistA is an excellent strategist , able to see moves ahead in games like chess and go , and ProtagonistA is also a master of memory , able to remember vast amounts of information with ease 
 Or , if we did , ProtagonistA would be a very different person 
There was ProtagonistA ; or ProtagonistA was both , or neither 
 One moment ProtagonistA would be a beautiful young woman , and the next ProtagonistA would be an old crone 
 ProtagonistA was a mystery , and that was part of ProtagonistA's appeal 
 ProtagonistA was always calm and collected , even in the midst of chaos 
 One day , ProtagonistA disappeared 
 ProtagonistA left no trace behind , except for those piercing blue eyes 
 If you are lucky enough to find ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA will share ProtagonistA's knowledge with you and help you to understand the mysteries of nature 
ProtagonistA was a bad cook and a bad soldier , and ProtagonistA died of a broken heart 
 ProtagonistA was always getting into trouble for ProtagonistA's incompetence , and ProtagonistA's fellow soldiers would often make fun of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so nervous that ProtagonistA burned the food 
ProtagonistA lay barefoot by the side of ProtagonistA's aunt 's house in the woods of Gower , where ProtagonistA had spent the good part of ProtagonistA's childhood 
 ProtagonistA was weeping heartily over ProtagonistA's aunt 's death 
 ProtagonistA had been very close to ProtagonistA's aunt and felt like ProtagonistA had lost a part of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was also grieving for the loss of ProtagonistA's childhood home 
 ProtagonistA had many happy memories of running and playing in the woods with ProtagonistA's cousins 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost everything 
ProtagonistA was walking home from the store when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's purse at the counter 
 ProtagonistA did n't have any money to pay for a bus or taxi , so ProtagonistA started walking 
 After a few blocks , ProtagonistA saw a penny on the ground 
 ProtagonistA picked it up and made a wish that ProtagonistA would get home safely 
 ProtagonistA continued walking and eventually made it home 
 ProtagonistA was tired and hungry , but ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA did n't have to spend any money on a lift home 
ProtagonistA was always a bit of a liar 
 ProtagonistA would make up stories about ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA's family , ProtagonistA's friends 
 Sometimes ProtagonistA would even lie about things that had happened to ProtagonistA , making them sound more exciting or interesting than they really were 
 ProtagonistA would never sugarcoat how ProtagonistA felt about something , whether it was good or bad 
ProtagonistA had a very good eye , ProtagonistA's friend said , and looked after ProtagonistA's money 
 ProtagonistA was always very careful with ProtagonistA's spending and was always on the lookout for a good deal 
ProtagonistA had always been a rebellious teenager 
 ProtagonistA was never happy at home and was always looking for a way to leave 
 When ProtagonistA was thirteen , ProtagonistA finally ran away from home 
 ProtagonistA did n't have any particular destination in mind , ProtagonistA just wanted to get away from ProtagonistC 
 A few days after ProtagonistA left , ProtagonistA received a call from ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't believe ProtagonistB at first , but ProtagonistA could hear the fear in ProtagonistB's voice 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to go back home and help ProtagonistC 
 When ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA could see the terror in ProtagonistC's eyes 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to try and save ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA started to pray and the demon became enraged 
 ProtagonistA knew then that ProtagonistA had been chosen to save ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA had always been rebellious , but ProtagonistA now knew that ProtagonistA was meant for something more 
ProtagonistA had been a hulking , cold - eyed thing for the past two weeks 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's short life , and ProtagonistA was tired 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be normal , like the others 
 But ProtagonistA knew that was impossible now 
 ProtagonistA was a monster , and that was all ProtagonistA would ever be 
The summer ProtagonistA left home , ProtagonistA lost an arm 
 It was a tragic accident that happened while ProtagonistA was out swimming with ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA was unsure of how ProtagonistA would ever be able to cope with the loss 
 With the help of ProtagonistA's family and friends , ProtagonistA slowly began to adjust to ProtagonistA's new life 
 ProtagonistA learned how to do things with ProtagonistA's one arm and even managed to find a new hobby- painting 
 ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA could express ProtagonistA through ProtagonistA's art and it helped ProtagonistA to heal 
 Although ProtagonistA will always miss ProtagonistA's arm , ProtagonistA has learned to live a full and happy life 
ProtagonistA glared at ProtagonistB , vigorously stirring the bowl of frosting 
 ProtagonistA had the foul look of the psychotic 
 ProtagonistA was always so angry , always so ready to lash out 
 ProtagonistA was always stirring up trouble , always making things difficult for ProtagonistB 
 Today , ProtagonistA was making a cake 
 And ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA made the cake , and then ProtagonistA put frosting on it 
 Then ProtagonistA smiled , a sick , twisted smile , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA had won 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who lived in a small village in France 
 ProtagonistA was very poor and had to work hard to make ends meet 
 One day , ProtagonistA heard about a fountain in the nearby town of West and North - East France that was said to have magical powers 
 ProtagonistA decided to go there and see for ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA saw that the grapevines were ripe and ready to sing 
 ProtagonistA also saw that there were ten thousand pretty little green hens falling from the sky 
 ProtagonistA was amazed and could n't believe ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA ran away from the town as fast as ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA never went back to that town again and ProtagonistA never told anyone what really happened 
 ProtagonistA was afraid that people would think ProtagonistA was a witch and ProtagonistA would be burned at the stake 
 ProtagonistA lived the rest of ProtagonistA's life in fear , but ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA was able to see the magical fountain for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was confident that ProtagonistA could get away with anything 
 ProtagonistA knew that it was n't safe to gamble away an airship , but ProtagonistA did it anyway 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA could get away with it 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's short life , but ProtagonistA was a strong girl 
 ProtagonistA had to be , for ProtagonistA's little sister 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's sister more than anything in the world 
 One night , ProtagonistA was up late , taking care of ProtagonistA's sister 
 ProtagonistA was exhausted , but ProtagonistA could n't go to bed until ProtagonistA's sister was asleep 
 As ProtagonistA sat there , ProtagonistA started to think about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB so much 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to see ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was never the brightest student at Hogwarts 
 ProtagonistA was always a few steps behind ProtagonistA's classmates , and ProtagonistA's father was the brightest wizard in the world 
 But ProtagonistA never gave up 
 ProtagonistA studied hard and eventually became an Auror 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA , before the sun rose , that ProtagonistA was about to start ProtagonistA's night shift , and change ProtagonistA's clothes 
 ProtagonistA had on a pair of shorts and a tank top , and ProtagonistA was feeling the heat 
 ProtagonistA walked into ProtagonistA's room and changed into ProtagonistA's work clothes , which were a bit more comfortable 
 ProtagonistA then went to the kitchen to get something to eat before ProtagonistA's shift 
ProtagonistA was a young woman in the nineteen - thirties who found ProtagonistA in a dangerous prison 
 ProtagonistA believed that time travelers could help ProtagonistA's escape and so ProtagonistA began to search for them 
 ProtagonistA came across many people who claimed to be time travelers , but none of them could help ProtagonistA 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA agreed and the two of them traveled back in time to the nineteen - thirties 
ProtagonistA was a very special girl 
 ProtagonistA had a gift that very few people had 
 ProtagonistA could see the future 
 ProtagonistA was never wrong 
 ProtagonistA was always very quiet and introspective 
 ProtagonistA would sit for hours by ProtagonistA , just thinking about the future 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had a great gift , but ProtagonistA did n't want to use it for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA wanted to help others 
 So , ProtagonistA became a counselor 
 ProtagonistA would help people make decisions by showing them what the future held 
 ProtagonistA was always very careful not to change anyone 's future , but ProtagonistA could give them a glimpse of what was to come 
 ProtagonistA was very happy with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was helping others and doing what ProtagonistA loved 
 ProtagonistA was content and at peace 
ProtagonistA was always fascinated by magic 
 As a child , ProtagonistA would watch ProtagonistA's favorite wizards perform on TV and ProtagonistA would dream of being a wizard ProtagonistA one day 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
In ProtagonistA's youth , ProtagonistA was very much interested in things which interested ProtagonistB ; and ProtagonistA was but too happy to indulge in any sort of playboy activity 
 ProtagonistA was always ready and willing to join in any frolic or escapade which ProtagonistB might suggest , and never thought of the consequences 
 But ProtagonistA was so full of fun and high spirits that nobody could help liking ProtagonistA , in spite of ProtagonistA's faults 
ProtagonistA has seen ProtagonistA's fair share of pain , ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA 's not sure if ProtagonistA can handle anymore , but ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA has to keep going 
 ProtagonistA has to be strong for ProtagonistA and for the people who need ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was back in the Kremlin , slinging hints at ProtagonistA's wife and son while ProtagonistA sat in ProtagonistA's comfortable chair 
 ProtagonistA told them about how ProtagonistB had given ProtagonistA a tour of the Kremlin and how ProtagonistB had showed ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's private collection of art 
 ProtagonistA even showed ProtagonistA's wife and son a picture of ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had taken while ProtagonistA was there 
ProtagonistA had been working as a servant in the house for years 
 ProtagonistA was getting old and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's time was running out 
 ProtagonistA was content to live out ProtagonistA's days in the servants ' quarters , but ProtagonistA was always aware of the other servants ' gossip 
 One day , ProtagonistA overheard two of the younger servants talking about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA decided to ignore them and went about ProtagonistA's business 
ProtagonistA always hated ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA always wished ProtagonistA had a different , more interesting name 
 ProtagonistA always tried to make ProtagonistA's name more interesting by adding nicknames or middle names , but nothing ever stuck 
 ProtagonistA was always just Alice 
 And ProtagonistA hated it 
 All ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistA loved spending time with ProtagonistA's friends and family , and ProtagonistA loved learning new things 
 Maybe ProtagonistA could be a teacher , ProtagonistA thought , or a doctor 
 Or maybe ProtagonistA could be an astronaut 
ProtagonistA had been searching for ProtagonistA's mother 's house for fifteen minutes and was getting frustrated 
 ProtagonistA had been walking around the neighborhood for a while , but could n't seem to find the right house 
 Finally , ProtagonistA came to a door that looked familiar 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door and ProtagonistA's mother answered 
ProtagonistA was walking through a beautiful garden when ProtagonistA saw a door 
 ProtagonistA walked up to it and opened it 
 ProtagonistA walked inside and saw a beautiful throne 
 ProtagonistA sat down in it and suddenly ProtagonistA was dreaming 
 In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA was a queen 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a beautiful dress and a crown 
 ProtagonistA was so happy 
 Then ProtagonistA woke up 
 The only fault on which ProtagonistA is minded is that ProtagonistA has not yet regained the capacity of an adult man , but for whom , owing to the inherent value of youth and to ProtagonistA's own congenital beauty , the balance of society naturally imposed on ProtagonistA a certain age of vigor and of mature intellectual development 
 Nevertheless , it is to ProtagonistB's credit that ProtagonistA is living , and ProtagonistA is grateful to ProtagonistB for ProtagonistA's help in regaining some measure of mental and physical health 
ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head dismissively as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB drift into the station carriages 
 ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB around before , always looking lost and alone 
 ProtagonistA wondered where ProtagonistB was going , and if anyone was waiting for ProtagonistB at the other end 
 ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB until ProtagonistB was out of sight , wondering what ProtagonistB's story was 
ProtagonistA was one of the most famous and respected minds of ProtagonistA's time 
 ProtagonistA was a woman of letters and a woman of ideas 
 But ProtagonistA was not a man 
 ProtagonistA was a woman 
ProtagonistA had bought a silvery , lustreless dress for £ 20 , which ProtagonistA had made ProtagonistA and which Carol had thrown away because ProtagonistA had no more money , gave ProtagonistA extreme suspicion of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did not like either of them 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB was following ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was right 
 ProtagonistA struggled and fought , but ProtagonistA was no match for ProtagonistB's strength 
 ProtagonistA lay there , bleeding to death , as ProtagonistB laughed maniacally 
ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA does n't have time to explain 
 ProtagonistA 's going to leave this town and never look back 
 ProtagonistA has a one way ticket to New York and ProtagonistA 's never been happier 
 ProtagonistA 's going to miss ProtagonistA's friends , but ProtagonistA knows they 'll understand 
 ProtagonistA was happy to watch ProtagonistB enjoy ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that there was danger lurking in the shadows 
 But ProtagonistA proved to be a perfect gentleman in every respect , and I have been happy here ever since 
 ProtagonistA always has a kind word and a warm smile for me , and I know I can always count on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a strange creature , with ProtagonistA's big eyes and dark hair 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a dress that was much too big for ProtagonistA , and it made ProtagonistA look like a child 
 Of course not ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'm just a girl 
 That 's not magic ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA thought for a moment 
 ProtagonistA had seen a lot of magic in ProtagonistA's life , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to do any of it ProtagonistA 
 Finally , ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA ca n't do any magic 
 ProtagonistA was terrified , and ProtagonistA started to cry 
 Please do n't ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'm not a witch 
 ProtagonistA screamed as the flames engulfed ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been the last of the contestants , but ProtagonistA 'd won 
 ProtagonistA 'd been so sure that ProtagonistA was going to lose that ProtagonistA 'd almost not even entered the contest 
 But ProtagonistA 'd decided to give it a shot , and ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had 
 ProtagonistA 'd won a trip to Hawaii , and ProtagonistA was going to enjoy every minute of it 
 ProtagonistA was going to spend ProtagonistA's days lounging on the beach , drinking cocktails , and getting a tan 
 ProtagonistA was going to have the time of ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA stared out the window , watching the raindrops race each other down the glass 
 But today , for some reason , ProtagonistA felt a little bit restless 
 ProtagonistA paced around the living room for a while , then went to the kitchen to make some tea 
 ProtagonistA had never really looked through it before , but for some reason , today felt like the perfect day to do so 
 ProtagonistA sat down at the kitchen table with the album and a cup of tea , and began flipping through the pages 
 ProtagonistA smiled as ProtagonistA looked at each one , but ProtagonistA could n't help feeling a little bit sad , too 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's family so much 
 ProtagonistA got up quickly , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest , and went to see who it was 
 ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief and invited ProtagonistB in 
 I'm so glad ProtagonistB 're here ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA was feeling a little bit lonely 
 ProtagonistA nodded , and they went outside 
 The fresh air felt good and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's spirits start to lift 
Unlike many high - class accountants in Paris , who ride in on a camel , or even a donkey , which is considerably larger , and which is slower than the standard coach , ProtagonistA rarely rode a mule , and ProtagonistA was very glad when ProtagonistA did ride a mule , because it enabled ProtagonistA to do all kinds of things within the limits of ProtagonistA's strength 
 For example , ProtagonistA was able to go to the market and buy fresh vegetables , which ProtagonistA then took home and cooked for ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA was also able to visit ProtagonistA's friends and relatives , and even go on short trips outside of the city 
ProtagonistA had always been a big fan of Quidditch 
 ProtagonistA loved watching the games and dreamed of one day being a professional player 
 When ProtagonistA was twelve , ProtagonistA started to think about winning the Quidditch World Cup 
 ProtagonistA knew it would be a long shot , but ProtagonistA was determined to try 
 ProtagonistA started practicing every day , and ProtagonistA quickly became one of the best players in ProtagonistA's school 
 ProtagonistA worked hard and helped the team win the World Cup 
 It was a dream come true for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was proud to have achieved ProtagonistA's goal 
ProtagonistA had no name , and no business of ProtagonistA's own , but ProtagonistA had been told many a great lie , and none of them made a hair 's breadth more certain 
 But ProtagonistA did n't believe any of it 
 So ProtagonistA went on living ProtagonistA's life , day by day , not really caring about anything beyond ProtagonistA's small world 
ProtagonistA had thought ProtagonistA dead more times than ProtagonistA cared to remember 
 ProtagonistA would try to sit up , only to find ProtagonistA pinned down by some invisible force 
 ProtagonistA would try to cry out , but no sound would come out 
 ProtagonistA would struggle and fight , but it was always futile 
 ProtagonistA would eventually give up , resigning ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's fate 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistA woke up and ProtagonistA was free 
 ProtagonistA could move and ProtagonistA could speak 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what had happened , but ProtagonistA was grateful for it 
 ProtagonistA got up and looked around , only to find ProtagonistA in a strange place 
 ProtagonistA did n't recognize anything , but ProtagonistA could hear voices 
 ProtagonistA followed the voices , only to find ProtagonistA in front of a large door 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , before finally opening the door 
 ProtagonistA gasped as ProtagonistA saw the sight before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was in a vast hall , with a long table in the middle 
 Sitting around the table were all sorts of creatures , some ProtagonistA recognized and some ProtagonistA didn't 
 ProtagonistA had always been content to live in ProtagonistA's small village , surrounded by ProtagonistA's family and friends 
 ProtagonistA had always been a brave girl , so ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to join the group 
 And there , at the top of Death , ProtagonistA found what ProtagonistA had been searching for all along : ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was driving up the hill when ProtagonistA drove ProtagonistA's horse into a deep ravine 
 ProtagonistA tried to help the horse , but it was too heavy 
 ProtagonistA had to go for help 
 ProtagonistA has been helping ProtagonistB since ProtagonistB was a little girl and ProtagonistA will continue to help ProtagonistB as long as ProtagonistA can 
When I was a boy , ProtagonistA always had a large library in which ProtagonistA kept all that ProtagonistA had learned in ProtagonistA's medical profession , in addition to all the books which ProtagonistA had in ProtagonistA's room 
 ProtagonistA was always very kind to me , and would often let me borrow books from ProtagonistA's library 
ProtagonistA had been fighting the Black Council for years 
 ProtagonistA had finally had enough 
 ProtagonistA gathered ProtagonistA's army and marched on the Black Council 's castle 
 ProtagonistA fought ProtagonistA's way through the guards and took the castle by storm 
ProtagonistA had been very quiet all morning , but when ProtagonistA woke up it was to breathe the first sound of life 
 ProtagonistA had been in a coma for weeks , and the doctors had told ProtagonistA's family that ProtagonistA was n't going to make it 
 But here ProtagonistA was , alive and well 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA had survived , but ProtagonistA was grateful for the second chance 
 ProtagonistA gladly agreed and set to work writing a beautiful letter full of compliments and well - wishes 
 ProtagonistA was sure the lady would be thrilled to receive such a kind letter from a stranger 
ProtagonistA came to a house on a river that was looming ominously before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had a feeling that something was watching ProtagonistA from the shadows , but ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling 
 ProtagonistA approached the house cautiously , but the door was unlocked 
 ProtagonistA stepped inside and was immediately hit with a wave of cold air 
 ProtagonistA began to feel uneasy , and ProtagonistA was about to leave when ProtagonistA heard a noise from upstairs 
 ProtagonistA slowly made ProtagonistA's way up the stairs , and ProtagonistA found a door that was slightly ajar 
 ProtagonistA pushed it open and saw ProtagonistB sitting on the floor , crying 
 ProtagonistA slowly backed out of the room and ran out of the house 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what was going on , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA did n't want to be there 
ProtagonistA had brought home three sets of glasses and a large enough bag to keep them all , an obvious precaution since there was no way of knowing what ProtagonistA 'd be up against , especially when ProtagonistA was n't simply playing chess or poker or bowling 
 ProtagonistA was going to have to be prepared for anything , and that meant being able to see 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure when ProtagonistA might need them , but ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would 
As ProtagonistA thought , ProtagonistA lifted ProtagonistA's head up to look around ProtagonistA's bright blue house 
 And for a moment , ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA saw a long , dark , empty room , with little else than a door and a rickety stove 
 But then ProtagonistA blinked , and the room was gone , replaced by ProtagonistA's cozy living room with its comfortable furniture and bright fire in the fireplace 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and went back to ProtagonistA's book 
 ProtagonistA smiled as ProtagonistA thought of the impression ProtagonistA was about to make upon the company at the breakfast - table 
 But as ProtagonistA turned to leave the room , ProtagonistA was suddenly aware of a presence behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned back , and saw , to ProtagonistA's horror , a figure dressed in black , with a hood pulled low over its face 
 Finally , ProtagonistA gathered ProtagonistA's courage and spoke 
  Who are you ?  ProtagonistA asked in a trembling voice 
  ProtagonistA demand to know who you are !  ProtagonistA cried 
 ProtagonistA turned and fled from the room , and did not stop until ProtagonistA had reached the safety of ProtagonistA's own bedroom 
 There , ProtagonistA sank down onto the bed , trembling and breathless 
 What had ProtagonistA seen ? Was it a ghost ? A burglar ? Or something even worse ? ProtagonistA had no idea , but ProtagonistA knew one thing for sure : ProtagonistA would never forget the terror of that moment as long as ProtagonistA lived 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the barn , looking out over the field where ProtagonistA's father had once settled cattle 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about how ProtagonistA's life had changed so much in the last few years 
 ProtagonistA had gone from being a ranch hand to being the owner of the ranch 
 ProtagonistA loved the land and the animals 
 ProtagonistA even loved the hard work 
 ProtagonistA had always been a morbid person , always thinking about death and what came after 
 ProtagonistA was n't scared of death , but ProtagonistA was curious 
 ProtagonistA wondered what it would be like to die 
 Would ProtagonistA see a white light ? Would ProtagonistA feel pain ? Or would it just be a peaceful sleep ? ProtagonistA hoped it would be the latter 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to die in pain , ProtagonistA wanted to die peacefully in ProtagonistA's sleep 
 ProtagonistA crossed her fingers tighter and closed ProtagonistA's eyes , imagining what it would be like to die 
Not long after ProtagonistA had finished ProtagonistA's story ProtagonistA heard a voice speak from the woods 
 ProtagonistA was curious , so ProtagonistA followed the voice into the woods 
 ProtagonistA was amazed by the story and thanked the woman for telling it to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had seen that look before , but never directed at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know why , but ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA blushing under ProtagonistB's gaze 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as Frank 
 As the conversation flowed , ProtagonistA began to feel something ProtagonistA had never felt before 
 ProtagonistA could n't put a name to it , but ProtagonistA knew it was something special 
 ProtagonistA knew that this was something ProtagonistA would never forget 
 ProtagonistA is now a powerful witch ProtagonistA and uses ProtagonistA's magic to help others 
ProtagonistA was reading a book to ProtagonistA's son when ProtagonistA noticed that no one else in the room seemed to be reading 
 ProtagonistA walked over to the bookshelf and saw that there were no other books out 
  ProtagonistA do n't think anyone else here has the same idea ,  ProtagonistA said as ProtagonistA stood up and walked back to ProtagonistA's son 
 ProtagonistA prevailed by ProtagonistA's grace and power upon the truth of ProtagonistB's pleadings 
ProtagonistA was a black - haired , skinny thirteen - year - old boy , who , like so many other young people in the late nineteenth century , was surprised to find out that ProtagonistA was going to be a man , and to live a long , long life 
 ProtagonistA had always thought that ProtagonistA would be a woman , and have a short life , like ProtagonistA's mother 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to react , or what to do 
 But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to accept it , and make the best of it 
 ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA was also excited 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had a lot to learn , and that ProtagonistA would have to make some tough choices 
 But ProtagonistA was ready for the challenge , and ProtagonistA was determined to make the most of ProtagonistA's new life 
ProtagonistA was warm , the yellow sunflower in ProtagonistA's hair , and ProtagonistA was silent all the while 
 ProtagonistA looked down at the daisy in ProtagonistA's hand and then back up at the sky 
 ProtagonistA felt at peace 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and took a deep breath 
ProtagonistA was out for a walk on a beautiful summer day 
 ProtagonistA was enjoying the scenery when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB waiting for ProtagonistA in ProtagonistB's car 
ProtagonistA laid down in the bed and sank down to the level of ProtagonistA's knees 
 ProtagonistA felt the familiar warmth of the bedspread on ProtagonistA's skin and the mattress molding around ProtagonistA's body 
 ProtagonistA let out a deep breath and closed ProtagonistA's eyes , feeling the tension of the day melting away 
 ProtagonistA was just about to drift off to sleep when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the other side of the room 
 ProtagonistA slowly opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw ProtagonistB standing in the corner , watching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA froze , not knowing what to do 
 ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB running after ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was n't going to make it 
 ProtagonistA turned around and faced ProtagonistB , prepared for the worst 
 ProtagonistA stood there for a moment , trying to process what had just happened 
 Then ProtagonistA ran to the door and locked it , making sure ProtagonistB was really gone 
 ProtagonistA leaned against the door , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
ProtagonistA had known nothing but blows from the very beginning , even before ProtagonistA became a hydra 
 ProtagonistA was always afraid , always on edge 
 When ProtagonistA became a hydra , ProtagonistA thought things would be different 
 ProtagonistA would be able to defend ProtagonistA , to fight back 
 But even as a hydra , ProtagonistA was constantly under attack 
 ProtagonistA had had enough 
ProtagonistA had been working as a maid for ProtagonistB for years , and ProtagonistA knew all of ProtagonistB's secrets 
 ProtagonistA knew how to get ProtagonistB pregnant ; but ProtagonistB was n't exactly what ProtagonistA had in mind 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted a family of ProtagonistA's own , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's opportunity when ProtagonistB became pregnant 
 ProtagonistA convinced ProtagonistB to let ProtagonistA raise the child as ProtagonistA's own , and ProtagonistA promised to take care of ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's child 
ProtagonistA was a man of fifty - one years of age , but more than half a century dead , and turning over in ProtagonistA's grave , ProtagonistA was beginning to remember ProtagonistA's youth as though it had happened yesterday 
 ProtagonistA remembered the day ProtagonistA had first met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been out walking in the park with ProtagonistA's friends when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA walked over to ProtagonistB and they began talking 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB terribly , but ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA could remember ProtagonistB so vividly 
ProtagonistA was an old man when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's late seventies , and ProtagonistB was in ProtagonistB's early twenties 
 ProtagonistA had been a patient of ProtagonistB for years , ever since ProtagonistB had started ProtagonistB's practice 
 ProtagonistA had always been a kind and gentle woman , and ProtagonistB had always been a respectful and caring doctor 
 One day , after ProtagonistA's usual check - up , ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB to sit down with ProtagonistA for a cup of tea 
 ProtagonistA had something ProtagonistA wanted to tell ProtagonistB 
 Watson ,  ProtagonistA began ,  ProtagonistA have something to confess 
 ProtagonistA am a man 
 It 's a long story ,  ProtagonistA said 
 So ProtagonistA changed ProtagonistA's name and ProtagonistA's appearance and started living as a woman 
When ProtagonistC fell seriously ill , ProtagonistA , in the first months of the nineteenth century , had it in ProtagonistA to believe that ProtagonistA owed ProtagonistA's life to the kindness of ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA looked across the lake from the ship at the end of the wooden deck , which allowed ProtagonistA to see the grass and all the trees 
 ProtagonistA was on a cruise with ProtagonistA's family , and they were about to dock in the port 
 ProtagonistA could see the other ships in the harbor , and the people on the shore 
 ProtagonistA was excited to get off the ship and explore the town 
ProtagonistA had always been a bright girl 
 ProtagonistA excelled in ProtagonistA's studies , and was top of ProtagonistA's class in mathematics 
 When ProtagonistA was younger , ProtagonistA had dreamed of becoming a doctor , but as ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA realized that it was n't the career for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to deal with sick people and their problems ; ProtagonistA wanted to help people prevent illnesses 
 And so , ProtagonistA decided to become a medical essayist 
 ProtagonistA was very successful in ProtagonistA's new career 
 ProtagonistA wrote many articles on various medical topics , and ProtagonistA's work was widely read 
 ProtagonistA was also very popular among ProtagonistA's colleagues 
 However , after a few years , ProtagonistA began to feel restless 
 ProtagonistA missed the excitement of ProtagonistA's old profession , and ProtagonistA longed to help people in a more direct way 
 And so , ProtagonistA made the decision to go back to medicine 
 ProtagonistA applied for a doctorate , and soon ProtagonistA was carrying on ProtagonistA's old profession once again 
 ProtagonistA was happy to be back in the field of medicine , and ProtagonistA quickly made a name for ProtagonistA as one of the most talented doctors in the country 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who had been diagnosed with a terminal illness 
 ProtagonistA traveled , ProtagonistA laughed , ProtagonistA loved 
 And when ProtagonistA's time came , ProtagonistA died peacefully in ProtagonistA's sleep 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden , surrounded by loved ones who had died before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt at peace and finally at home 
 ProtagonistA had to face ProtagonistA's greatest fear : judgement 
 ProtagonistA stood before a large door , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's life would be judged 
 But ProtagonistA was not afraid 
 ProtagonistA had lived a good life , and ProtagonistA was ready to face whatever came next 
ProtagonistA was dead , but ProtagonistA was gone : how could ProtagonistA have known that ProtagonistA was dead ? ProtagonistA had died in ProtagonistA's sleep , peacefully and without pain 
 But when ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a dark place 
 ProtagonistA could n't see anything , and ProtagonistA could n't move 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how long ProtagonistA had been there , but it felt like forever 
 ProtagonistA was scared and alone , and ProtagonistA wanted to go home 
 But ProtagonistA could n't go home , because ProtagonistA was dead 
ProtagonistA was not an expert in the art of voyaging , or even in navigation , but ProtagonistA was , however , an expert in sea - craft ; and Carol , was the same man who had made the first voyage , and had already brought with ProtagonistA , in consequence of curiosity and for infinite profit , a great quantity of useful knowledge and valuable experience , among which ProtagonistA had acquired , in a short time , because ProtagonistA had been accustomed to keep the knowledge of distant places in ProtagonistA's head , and had believed that ProtagonistA was always to find some necessary article for ProtagonistA's use in some remote corner of the earth , which ProtagonistA had come upon without any knowledge whatever of the locality 
Just before ProtagonistA was to die , ProtagonistA was surprised to find ProtagonistA at a loss for words 
 ProtagonistA had always been a chatty person , always ready with a quip or a story , but in ProtagonistA's final moments , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA tongue - tied 
 ProtagonistA could hear the machines beeping around ProtagonistA , the sound of ProtagonistA's own labored breathing , but ProtagonistA could n't think of anything to say 
 ProtagonistA wanted to tell ProtagonistA's loved ones how much ProtagonistA loved them , to say goodbye , but the words would n't come 
 As the darkness began to close in around ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA could only hope that they would understand 
ProtagonistA spent ProtagonistA's time reading , writing , dancing , or doing other things that were more likely to bring ProtagonistA into the world and bring ProtagonistA's pleasure 
 ProtagonistA also loved to dance , and ProtagonistA often did so in ProtagonistA's room when no one was around 
ProtagonistA was watching ProtagonistA's sister 's boy , said ProtagonistA , when , but for the unavoidable circumstance of striking ProtagonistA's beloved infant with ProtagonistA's hammer , ProtagonistA should have had the satisfaction of buying it at a reduced price 
 But as ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA wanted more out of life than just being a woman 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be a man , in the proper sense of the word , with a true mind and a real purpose 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be someone who was not only ProtagonistB's son , but had the advantage of ProtagonistA's family , both ancestors and friends , and an equal share of the luck and fortune which they enjoyed 
 And so ProtagonistA set out to learn what it truly meant to be a man 
 ProtagonistA studied hard and learned everything ProtagonistA could 
 And eventually , ProtagonistA became the man ProtagonistA always wanted to be 
ProtagonistA did not like the way ProtagonistA looked 
 ProtagonistA was too short , too round , and ProtagonistA's hair was always a mess 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could be more like ProtagonistA's friends , who were all tall and thin with perfect hair 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to make a change 
 ProtagonistA started eating less and working out more , and soon ProtagonistA was the one with the perfect body 
 But even though ProtagonistA looked good on the outside , ProtagonistA still did n't feel happy 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was never going to be satisfied with the way ProtagonistA looked , and that was okay 
 ProtagonistA was just there , in the moment , living ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA did n't care what other people thought of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA just did ProtagonistA's own thing 
ProtagonistA had always been a devout Christian , but when ProtagonistA's husband died , ProtagonistA began to doubt ProtagonistA's faith 
 ProtagonistA started to believe that maybe there were other forces at work in the world , forces that ProtagonistA could n't see or understand 
 So , when ProtagonistA sat down to read from the Book of the Law , ProtagonistA had only one intention and that was to banish ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had read about ProtagonistB in the book and knew that ProtagonistB was responsible for ProtagonistA's husband 's death 
 ProtagonistA was determined to get rid of ProtagonistB and make sure that ProtagonistB never hurt anyone again 
 ProtagonistA read the words of the banishment spell aloud and then felt a presence leave ProtagonistA's body 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was gone and ProtagonistA felt relief wash over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had saved ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never doubt ProtagonistA's faith again 
ProtagonistA wish it was a story , said ProtagonistA , holding out ProtagonistA's pinky index finger , which ProtagonistA dubbed super - power , to ProtagonistB 
 As their fingers touched , ProtagonistA felt a sudden jolt of power and ProtagonistB was pulled into ProtagonistA's story 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA had to bring ProtagonistB back to reality 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , but ProtagonistB ca n't stay here forever ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB go , feeling happy that ProtagonistA was able to share ProtagonistA's story with someone 
In the year of our Lord 1184 , ProtagonistA received a letter written by ProtagonistA's friends , in which they congratulated ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's success in a certain career in which ProtagonistA had been offered a fortune 
 ProtagonistA was overjoyed to receive the letter , and immediately set about writing a reply to ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA thanked them for their kind words , and told them that ProtagonistA was looking forward to starting ProtagonistA's new career 
 ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer , and ProtagonistA had always wanted to make a difference in the world 
 ProtagonistA was grateful to ProtagonistA's friends for believing in ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would not let them down 
 With their support , ProtagonistA was confident that ProtagonistA could achieve anything ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to 
ProtagonistA set out for the farm at the end of the summer to take ProtagonistA's share of the stock ProtagonistA had bought with ProtagonistA's father 's money , which , in the course of the last year , had increased to three millions of dollars , and which , at the time that Mr
 ProtagonistA had not been at the farm since ProtagonistA was a child , and ProtagonistA was looking forward to the trip with a mixture of excitement and trepidation 
 After ProtagonistA had settled in , ProtagonistA went down to the barn to see the animals 
 ProtagonistA was pleased to see that the farm had flourished in ProtagonistA's absence and that the stock was healthy and happy 
 The next morning , ProtagonistA set out to explore the farm 
 ProtagonistA walked through the fields , admiring the crops and the view 
 As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and contentment come over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA realized that this was where ProtagonistA belonged and that ProtagonistA had been foolish to ever leave 
 ProtagonistA spent the rest of the summer working on the farm and getting to know the people who worked there 
 By the time ProtagonistA left , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had finally come home 
There was once ProtagonistA , no matter what ProtagonistA tried to do in life , ProtagonistA just could n't seem to get ahead 
 ProtagonistA had a good job , but ProtagonistA's bills always seemed to be one step ahead of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA tried to save money , but it never seemed to last very long 
 ProtagonistA even tried to get a better job , but it seemed like the only jobs available were ones that paid less than ProtagonistA was already making 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was stuck in a never - ending cycle of just getting by 
When the day of a third world war comes , ProtagonistA has ProtagonistA's minders ready to give ProtagonistA permission to start it 
ProtagonistA blinked , now that ProtagonistA had fully recovered from the overwhelming sense of relief during the dance as the nine people who had been invited to the ball had all been eliminated , and ProtagonistA was sitting with ProtagonistA's back arched and ProtagonistA's head hanging down , and ProtagonistA thought for a moment about what ProtagonistA was going to say in the next few moments 
  With that , ProtagonistA stood up and walked out of the room , leaving the stunned guests behind 
ProtagonistA had promised to give ProtagonistB a birthday party , and on the morning of the birthday , ProtagonistB had the party laid out for ProtagonistA 
 However , when ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's room to give ProtagonistB the present , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistB had passed away in ProtagonistB's sleep 
 So ProtagonistA did , and it was a beautiful tribute to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a strange child 
 ProtagonistA was never quite like the other kids ProtagonistA's age and ProtagonistA always seemed to be in ProtagonistA's own world 
 ProtagonistA had lived in a certain house in the churchyard when ProtagonistA was six or seven and ProtagonistA's body was found in the same house , but there was no sign of any foul play 
The first time I met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was walking along the banks of the Ostrich in the same town where ProtagonistA had been born and high - born 
 ProtagonistA had been living a long life , old and gray and in love 
 ProtagonistA was walking with ProtagonistA's husband , who was also old and gray and in love 
ProtagonistA came on slowly , but ProtagonistA was vigorous and determined 
 ProtagonistA had a goal in mind , and ProtagonistA was going to achieve it no matter what 
ProtagonistA had not expected to get anything from this world , but ProtagonistA had not been particularly surprised , either 
 ProtagonistA had lived a long and happy life , and ProtagonistA was content with what ProtagonistA had 
 Still , when ProtagonistA saw the beautiful necklace lying on ProtagonistA's bedside table , ProtagonistA could not help but be pleased 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB had left it for ProtagonistA to find , and ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistB's thoughtfulness 
 ProtagonistA would treasure it always 
 It was the first time ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB since ProtagonistB had been diagnosed with cancer , and ProtagonistA was so happy to see ProtagonistB up and about 
 ProtagonistA ran to ProtagonistB and gave ProtagonistB a big hug 
  ProtagonistA 'm so glad ProtagonistB 're feeling better , ProtagonistB !  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who lived in a small town 
 ProtagonistA was always dreaming of adventures and of finding treasures 
 One day , ProtagonistA heard a rumor that there was a flying horse in the nearby forest 
 ProtagonistA immediately set out to find it 
 After a long search , ProtagonistA finally found the horse 
 ProtagonistA was delighted 
 ProtagonistA was amazed at the sight 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in another world 
 ProtagonistA had the time of ProtagonistA's life and when ProtagonistA finally returned home , ProtagonistA was a changed person 
 ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA true calling in life and ProtagonistA was determined to follow ProtagonistA's dreams 
ProtagonistA had been walking by the morgue for weeks , ever since ProtagonistB's body had been found there 
 ProtagonistA had never seen a dead body before and ProtagonistA was curious 
 ProtagonistA stopped by the front of the morgue and asked if ProtagonistA should look into the morgue 
 ProtagonistA decided to go in 
 ProtagonistA was surprised at how clean and well - lit the inside of the morgue was 
 ProtagonistA walked down the aisle , looking at each body 
 ProtagonistA was about to leave when ProtagonistA saw a body that ProtagonistA recognized 
 ProtagonistA was surprised at how different ProtagonistB looked 
 ProtagonistA turned to leave , but not before ProtagonistA said a silent goodbye to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA could n't have been more than ten years old when ProtagonistA rose to break ProtagonistA's neck in the family crypt 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's living room , reading a book 
 ProtagonistA was enjoying the quiet afternoon , when ProtagonistA suddenly heard the sound of children playing flute 
 ProtagonistA got up from ProtagonistA's chair and went to the window to see where the music was coming from 
 ProtagonistA saw a group of children playing together in a park 
 As ProtagonistA watched them , ProtagonistA felt a sudden flash of inspiration 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA wanted to learn how to play the flute 
 But ProtagonistA was determined to learn 
 ProtagonistA went to the park the next day and asked the children if they could teach ProtagonistA how to play 
 ProtagonistA saw a rabbit and followed it into a hole 
 ProtagonistA fell down a rabbit hole and ended up in a strange place 
 ProtagonistA always wondered what had happened to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA never asked ProtagonistC about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to upset ProtagonistC 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was an adult , ProtagonistA decided to ask ProtagonistC what had happened to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had always thought ProtagonistB had just abandoned ProtagonistC , but it turns out ProtagonistB had actually left ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say or how to feel 
 Later that day , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's house 
 ProtagonistA had always known where ProtagonistB lived , but ProtagonistA had never had the courage to go there 
 Now that ProtagonistA knew the truth , ProtagonistA wanted to confront ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA sat down and asked ProtagonistB why ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC all those years ago 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA could ever forgive ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had finally found the answers ProtagonistA was looking for 
ProtagonistA made a small , relatively uncommitted appearance at the door of the former home of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did not allow ProtagonistB to remain there 
 However , ProtagonistA did not want to get too close to ProtagonistB , as ProtagonistB seemed unstable and dangerous 
ProtagonistA stood before ProtagonistA's desk one sunny day in August and looked over the papers that ProtagonistA held in ProtagonistA's magic hand 
 ProtagonistA was about to start ProtagonistA's new job as a teacher at the local elementary school and ProtagonistA was very excited 
 ProtagonistA was just about to start reading them when ProtagonistA heard a voice behind ProtagonistA 
 Excuse me , ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB standing in the doorway 
 Yes ?  ProtagonistA said 
 But as ProtagonistA started to read the names , ProtagonistA could n't help but think about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA wondered what the rest of the students in ProtagonistA's class would be like 
 Would they be as friendly as ProtagonistB ? ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA would find out soon enough 
ProtagonistA came to ProtagonistA through the bar , and ProtagonistA – opened ProtagonistA's eyes – saw the world entirely different from the way it was 
 ProtagonistA was in a dark , dank place , with creatures that ProtagonistA had never seen before 
 ProtagonistA was scared , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 Then , ProtagonistA saw a light , and ProtagonistA started to walk towards it 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what was at the end of the light , but ProtagonistA knew that it was better than where ProtagonistA was 
 As ProtagonistA got closer to the light , ProtagonistA started to see people , and they were all different colors 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was going on 
 ProtagonistA was kind and always had a smile for ProtagonistB , even when ProtagonistB made mistakes 
 One day , ProtagonistA came to the Yard with a serious look on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had to leave and would not be able to come back 
 ProtagonistA smiled and thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's kindness 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB and that ProtagonistB had helped to make ProtagonistA's time at the Yard special 
ProtagonistA was fourteen years old and ProtagonistC was a cold , hard - working , lonely widow who had no business putting ProtagonistA into such a bizarre situation 
 ProtagonistA had been working at the local grocery store for the past year , and ProtagonistA was due for a promotion 
When ProtagonistA heard that the fleet of the ministry of war was approaching , in Norfolk , the port of Southampton , ProtagonistA immediately ordered its repair 
ProtagonistA is a handsome , lanky fellow , with a black beard and a black - rimmed eye , and ProtagonistA is a very good man , for all the good ProtagonistA has done 
 ProtagonistA has been a friend to many , and has helped them in their time of need 
 ProtagonistA is always there for ProtagonistA's friends , and they know they can count on ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had the misfortune to be born in a large and well - ordered house on which ProtagonistA had been born and reared , and which ProtagonistA's grandfather had purchased for a gift for ProtagonistA 
 One day , while exploring the attic , ProtagonistA discovered a dusty old trunk 
 ProtagonistA put on the dress and twirled around the attic 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard someone coming up the stairs 
 But ProtagonistA was determined to wear the dress and so ProtagonistA ran away from home 
 ProtagonistA did n't get very far before ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's shoes behind 
 ProtagonistA put on the shoes and went back to the attic to find the dress 
ProtagonistA was down in the basement preparing to play ProtagonistA's music in a small VCR when ProtagonistB called ProtagonistA over 
 ProtagonistA had been planning to play ProtagonistA's music for hours , and now ProtagonistA would have to stop 
 ProtagonistA was so angry that ProtagonistA almost did n't go upstairs , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to 
 ProtagonistA was so shocked that ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA did as ProtagonistA was told , and soon they were on their way 
 ProtagonistA was so scared that ProtagonistA started to cry 
 ProtagonistA did n't believe ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA wanted to 
 ProtagonistA sat with ProtagonistA's parents all night , holding their hands and praying for them to wake up 
When I first met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was a respectable college student 
 ProtagonistA was well known in the neighborhood for being a member of the Acobalt House , or  House of the Green - Bears 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's garden , watching ProtagonistA's fowls , and ProtagonistA talked to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was very happy 
 ProtagonistA was telling ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's day , and how ProtagonistA had found a four - leaf clover 
 ProtagonistA said that it was a sign of good luck , and ProtagonistA was sure that it would bring ProtagonistA's luck 
One lovely day ProtagonistA was walking through the meadow and up to ProtagonistA's house 
 ProtagonistA had a basket of flowers in ProtagonistA's hand and a big smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 When ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's house , ProtagonistA put the basket of flowers down on the porch and went inside 
ProtagonistA was walking through the park when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on a bench , reading a book 
ProtagonistA did not know it then , but ProtagonistA was about to leave ProtagonistA's life behind 
 ProtagonistA was about to embark on a journey that would take ProtagonistA to a new world , a world ProtagonistA never could have imagined 
 ProtagonistA was about to meet new friends , and discover new things about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was about to have the time of ProtagonistA's life 
On the morning when ProtagonistA awoke , ProtagonistA stood in the garden , carrying ProtagonistA's trunk of books 
 ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and contentment 
 ProtagonistA had always loved books , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to have the time to read them all 
 ProtagonistA was going to start ProtagonistA's own library 
ProtagonistA was an ugly boy , and ProtagonistA knew it 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to be loved 
 ProtagonistA thought that if ProtagonistA could find someone to love ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA would finally be happy 
 ProtagonistA went through life looking for that one person , but ProtagonistA never found them 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to give up 
 ProtagonistA stopped looking for love and just focused on living ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA was happier this way 
 ProtagonistA was finally able to love ProtagonistA , and that was all that mattered 
ProtagonistA was one of those who , during the last days of ProtagonistA's life , fled into the great jungles of the interior of North America 
 ProtagonistA was a gentle giant , and everyone who met ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the park when ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA scooped up ProtagonistB and carried ProtagonistB home , where ProtagonistA nursed ProtagonistB back to health 
 Wherever ProtagonistA went , ProtagonistB went too 
 And ProtagonistA was happy to have someone to love who loved ProtagonistA back just as much 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw Miss Fortune 
  ProtagonistA was about to say something when Miss Fortune continued 
 But now ProtagonistA 'll never know 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible time trying to get the Flying Feline to work 
 ProtagonistA had been at it for hours , and was getting frustrated 
 But so far , ProtagonistA was not having any luck 
 Finally , ProtagonistA lost ProtagonistA's temper and started barking at the Feline 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA suddenly heard a voice behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB standing there 
 What is that ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA was skeptical , but ProtagonistA was also desperate 
 ProtagonistA agreed to let ProtagonistB help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB ProtagonistB's name 
  And ProtagonistA 're welcome 
ProtagonistA began to feel guilty when ProtagonistA was twelve 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was wrong and that ProtagonistA would have to face the consequences 
 ProtagonistA was scared of what ProtagonistA's parents would say or do 
 When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA confessed to ProtagonistA's parents what ProtagonistA had done 
 ProtagonistA learned ProtagonistA's lesson and never stole again 
ProtagonistA was fifteen when ProtagonistA had a dream in which ProtagonistA was swimming in a vast blue and white ocean 
 ProtagonistA could feel the warmth of the sun on ProtagonistA's skin and the coolness of the water around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt free and alive in the dream , and ProtagonistA woke up feeling refreshed and invigorated 
 ProtagonistA grew up to be a beautiful and talented young woman , but ProtagonistA always felt that something was missing 
 When ProtagonistA was twenty - five , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's true home 
ProtagonistA huffed , but ProtagonistA did n't puff 
 ProtagonistA was getting tired of walking , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA was starting to get hungry 
 ProtagonistA had packed a lunch , but ProtagonistA had left it at home 
 ProtagonistA had been so excited to go on ProtagonistA's hike that ProtagonistA had forgotten to grab it 
 ProtagonistA was regretting ProtagonistA's decision to go on this hike alone 
 ProtagonistA had wanted to get away from people for a while , but now ProtagonistA was wishing ProtagonistA had someone with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was getting scared and ProtagonistA wanted to go home 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was getting close to the end of the trail , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA could make it 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw the end of the trail 
 ProtagonistA was so relieved and happy that ProtagonistA started to run 
 ProtagonistA made it to ProtagonistA's car and drove home 
 ProtagonistA was never going to go on a hike alone again 
ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was not long for this world 
 In order to leave something behind , ProtagonistA decided to start a diary 
 ProtagonistA called it the Lazenby 's Diary , after ProtagonistA's favorite author 
 Every day , ProtagonistA would write in ProtagonistA's diary 
 ProtagonistA would write about ProtagonistA's day - to - day life , ProtagonistA's thoughts , ProtagonistA's feelings , and anything else that was on ProtagonistA's mind 
 As the days went by , ProtagonistA became more and more depressed 
 ProtagonistA wrote about ProtagonistA slowly wasting away body , ProtagonistA's increasing pain , and ProtagonistA's loneliness 
 As ProtagonistA's health deteriorated , so did ProtagonistA's writing 
 And then , one day , ProtagonistA stopped writing altogether 
ProtagonistA is at a party with ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA is wearing a beautiful dress and ProtagonistA's hair is done up in a pretty style 
 ProtagonistA looks like a princess 
ProtagonistA had such a huge view of the sea that ProtagonistA's mind seemed to be made up of seas : the wide , deep sheets that covered the vast north and south coasts , the black , under - sea channels that ran behind and in front of the archipelago , the glen which jutted out into the horizon to give a vast , rounded and sheltered edifice , and from which the narrow , narrow passages into the bowels of the ship , lined with luxuriant heather , sheltered the crew ; and the skies above all , where the blue - grey stars shone in their true blue glory , and the red stars which now flapped and twinkled in the night , of the moon and the stars , were all dreams to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was a young woman living in England in 1659 
ProtagonistA was walking through the park when ProtagonistA was hit by a bolt of lightning 
 ProtagonistA fell to the ground , unconscious 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in the body of a child 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how it had happened , but ProtagonistA was glad to be alive 
 ProtagonistA went to the nearest house and knocked on the door 
 ProtagonistA called ProtagonistA's parents and they came to pick ProtagonistA up 
ProtagonistA did not like to be disturbed , and ProtagonistA would not have it otherwise 
 ProtagonistA was a very private person , and ProtagonistA cherished ProtagonistA's alone time 
 When ProtagonistA was disturbed , ProtagonistA would usually just ignore the person or thing that was disturbing ProtagonistA 
 When this happened , ProtagonistA would usually lash out at the person or thing that was disturbing ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had a name for a machine that could change the course of the storm , but ProtagonistA never named it 
 ProtagonistA built it in the basement of ProtagonistA's house , using scraps of metal and bits of wire ProtagonistA scavenged from the junkyard 
 ProtagonistA tested it on days when the storm was brewing , and it always worked 
ProtagonistA was sound asleep when ProtagonistA was suddenly awoken by a noise 
 ProtagonistA sat up in bed and listened , but all was quiet 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to the window to see if there was anything there , but there was nothing 
 ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB in the distance , and ProtagonistB was coming towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was about to go back inside when ProtagonistB spoke 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to hear ProtagonistB talk , but ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 Who are ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 Can ProtagonistA help ProtagonistA was hesitant , but ProtagonistA did n't want to leave ProtagonistB out in the cold 
 Yes , ProtagonistB can stay with ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB inside and got ProtagonistB a drink 
 So , where are ProtagonistB travelling to ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA was curious and wanted to know more , but ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was tired 
 You can tell ProtagonistA all about it in the morning ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA lay awake for a while , thinking about ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's journey 
 ProtagonistA was excited to hear more about it in the morning 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner , preferring the company of ProtagonistA's books to that of people 
 But when ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA in the woods that night , ProtagonistA had been surprised to find another person there 
 ProtagonistA had been even more surprised when that person had turned out to be ProtagonistB 
 But since that night , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had become fast friends 
 ProtagonistA would visit ProtagonistB in the woods every night , and they would spend hours talking 
 ProtagonistA had never been so happy 
 But one night , ProtagonistA arrived in the woods to find that ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistA searched for ProtagonistB for hours , but ProtagonistB was nowhere to be found 
 But the next night , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance 
 ProtagonistA followed the noise until ProtagonistA came to a clearing , and there ProtagonistB was 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could never let ProtagonistB go again 
 ProtagonistA nursed ProtagonistB back to health , and from then on , they remained together 
 ProtagonistA had finally found the companionship ProtagonistA had always been searching for 
ProtagonistA had always been a go - getter 
 ProtagonistA was never content to sit idly by and let life pass ProtagonistA by 
 So , when ProtagonistA was faced with a difficult challenge , ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to take it on 
 ProtagonistA was currently in the middle of a tough project at work 
 So , when ProtagonistA was faced with a difficult task , ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to take it on 
 ProtagonistA worked tirelessly , never stopping until ProtagonistA was finished 
 And , when ProtagonistA was finally done , ProtagonistA looked back with a sense of satisfaction 
ProtagonistA was the most beautiful girl in the world , and ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA with all of ProtagonistB's heart 
 As ProtagonistA bled out , ProtagonistA smiled and thanked ProtagonistB 
 But on that fateful night , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistA's end at the hands of ProtagonistA's own son 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's hospital bed , hooked up to machines that beeped and whirred around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA could hear the nurses talking in hushed tones outside ProtagonistA's door , and ProtagonistA knew they were talking about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was going to die 
 ProtagonistA could feel it in ProtagonistA's bones 
 ProtagonistA was going to die and ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistA's family again 
Quietly ProtagonistA observed that ProtagonistB was the very picture of quiet and serene 
 ProtagonistA felt envious of ProtagonistB's ability to find such peace in the midst of chaos 
 ProtagonistA wondered what it would be like to feel that way ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA went over to the wharf , where three anchor - ships stood ready to receive ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA boarded the first ship and set sail for ProtagonistA's adventure 
There is something about ProtagonistA that makes ProtagonistA's body speak to us ; and ProtagonistA's voice makes us feel at once like ProtagonistA was there 
ProtagonistA was a bit of a eccentric 
 ProtagonistA was always coming up with new and interesting ideas , but ProtagonistA's latest one was by far the most bizarre 
 ProtagonistA convinced ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was immortal 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would never age and would never die 
 ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB a picture of ProtagonistA from when ProtagonistA was a child 
 ProtagonistA looked exactly the same as ProtagonistA did now 
 ProtagonistA really was immortal 
ProtagonistA had been having a long , hard day in the hospital wing when ProtagonistA suddenly had an accident 
 ProtagonistA called it an  insane accident  because ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never have been able to survive it otherwise 
 When ProtagonistA finally woke up , ProtagonistA was surprised to find that ProtagonistA was still alive 
 ProtagonistA was even more surprised to find that ProtagonistA was now a quadriplegic 
ProtagonistA was eight years old when ProtagonistA heard the story and the story just was n't the same anymore 
 ProtagonistA had loved the story of the little girl who went to a magical place and had adventures with talking animals , but now that ProtagonistA was older , ProtagonistA could see the holes in the story 
 ProtagonistA was disappointed , but ProtagonistA supposed that was just what happened when you grew up 
 ProtagonistA tried to remember the layout of the house , but it was hard to think clearly 
 ProtagonistA knew the door was ProtagonistA's only way out 
 ProtagonistA had to find a way to open it 
 ProtagonistA searched the room for something to help ProtagonistA , but there was nothing 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw a key on the floor 
 ProtagonistA picked it up and tried it in the door 
 It worked ! ProtagonistA opened the door and walked out into the sunlight 
 ProtagonistA was free ! 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's kitchen , puttering around and minding ProtagonistA's own business when ProtagonistA suddenly heard the doorbell ring 
 ProtagonistA smiled to ProtagonistA , thinking that maybe ProtagonistA's friends had come to surprise ProtagonistA with a visit 
 But when ProtagonistA peered into the hallway , ProtagonistA saw that it was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had never thought of ProtagonistA's paintings in that way before 
 ProtagonistA always just thought of them as pretty pictures that made people happy 
 ProtagonistA began to see ProtagonistA's paintings through ProtagonistB's eyes and ProtagonistA realized that maybe ProtagonistA was n't as good as ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was 
ProtagonistA stood on the deck of the ship as the sun sank into the horizon , an unending gaze in which ProtagonistA had both contempt and fascination 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never find out , but the thought still lingered in ProtagonistA's mind as ProtagonistA watched the sun disappear into the water 
ProtagonistA had been put out of ProtagonistA's misery , but ProtagonistA had not been without a struggle for days ; ProtagonistA had actually considered ProtagonistA unlucky 
 But in the end , ProtagonistA was too weak and ProtagonistA passed away 
 ProtagonistA's family was there with ProtagonistA , and they were all relieved that ProtagonistA was no longer in pain 
ProtagonistA is the best , for now 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA is loved , even if it is n't always shown 
ProtagonistA was in the middle of ProtagonistA's interview when ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA's face was marked 
 ProtagonistA did n't have the faintest idea of how to make it look serious 
 ProtagonistA tried to keep a straight face , but the interviewer could tell that something was wrong 
 Finally , ProtagonistA just gave up and told the interviewer what was going on 
 ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA had been trying to make a serious face , but it just was n't working 
ProtagonistA was a woman of means who lived in a large house at the end of the last century 
 ProtagonistA was increasingly concerned about the state of ProtagonistA's house and the people who were prostituting it 
 ProtagonistA lost all patience with them and decided to take matters into ProtagonistA's own hands 
 ProtagonistA hired a group of workers to come and clean up ProtagonistA's house and make it livable again 
 ProtagonistA was very pleased with the results and decided to stay in ProtagonistA's house for the rest of ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit overweight , but ProtagonistA had never really cared 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's body and loved to eat 
 However , when ProtagonistA turned 30 , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA needed to make a change 
 ProtagonistA started dieting and working out , and within a year , ProtagonistA had lost 50 pounds 
 ProtagonistA felt great and was finally happy with ProtagonistA's body 
  ProtagonistA tried to ignore them , but it was difficult 
 ProtagonistA knew they were just jealous of ProtagonistA's success , but it still hurt 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA started to gain back the weight 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's body no matter what ProtagonistA's friends and family said 
 However , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel disappointed 
 ProtagonistA had worked so hard to lose the weight and now it was all for nothing 
 ProtagonistA is still overweight , but ProtagonistA has learned to love ProtagonistA's body no matter what 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA is beautiful and deserves to be happy 
ProtagonistA had been working at ProtagonistA's job for about a month when ProtagonistA decided to explore the city a bit more 
 ProtagonistA had been living in the city for a year , but ProtagonistA never really had the time to explore it 
 ProtagonistA had always been too busy working or studying 
 On this particular Monday evening , ProtagonistA had some free time and ProtagonistA decided to make a discovery 
 ProtagonistA walked around for a while , taking in the sights and sounds of the city 
 ProtagonistA eventually came across a small park that ProtagonistA had never noticed before 
 ProtagonistA sat down on one of the benches and watched the sun set 
 ProtagonistA decided that from now on , ProtagonistA would make it a point to explore the city more and to discover new and wonderful things about it 
ProtagonistA was always a truth seeker 
 ProtagonistA was always looking for the answers to the big questions in life 
 Why are we here ? What is the meaning of life ? What happens when we die ? ProtagonistA was never satisfied with the answers ProtagonistA received from the mainstream sources 
 ProtagonistA always felt there was more to the story 
 In early 2013 , ProtagonistA started a website called Truth-ism
 On the site , ProtagonistA shared ProtagonistA's findings with the world 
 ProtagonistA dedicated a new page to the site on the day of ProtagonistA's death , titled Truthism 
 On the page , ProtagonistA shared ProtagonistA's final thoughts on life and death 
 ProtagonistA believed that the truth was out there , and ProtagonistA was determined to find it 
 ProtagonistA became obsessed with finding the answers to life 's big questions 
 ProtagonistA spent all ProtagonistA's time researching and writing on ProtagonistA's website 
 ProtagonistA neglected ProtagonistA's health and ProtagonistA's relationships 
 ProtagonistA became a hermit , barely leaving ProtagonistA's house 
 On the day of ProtagonistA's death , ProtagonistA finally found the answer to the question ProtagonistA had been searching for ProtagonistA's whole life 
 ProtagonistA realized that there was no one answer to the big questions 
 ProtagonistA also realized that the journey was more important than the destination 
ProtagonistA was always a very perceptive person 
 ProtagonistA could see through people 's facade and ProtagonistA always knew when something was off 
 ProtagonistA had always been a high - functioning person 
 ProtagonistA was successful in school and had a great group of friends 
 But underneath all of that , ProtagonistA was struggling 
 ProtagonistA was constantly anxious and had intrusive thoughts that ProtagonistA could n't shake 
 ProtagonistA started seeing things that were n't there and hearing voices 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to believe that ProtagonistA was sick 
 ProtagonistA was able to function better and ProtagonistA's symptoms started to lessen 
 However , ProtagonistA still had bad days 
 On those days , ProtagonistA would put on a mask of sanity 
 ProtagonistA would tell ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was just fine and that ProtagonistA was strong enough to get through this 
 And ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA is now doing better and ProtagonistA is living with ProtagonistA's mental illness 
 ProtagonistA is still the same perceptive person that ProtagonistA always was , but now ProtagonistA also has a better understanding of ProtagonistA 
In the year of our Lord , ProtagonistA , was expelled from the University of Stirling , because ProtagonistA had attempted to overthrow a treaty of peace made between the university and the Royal Society , which was published in the Royal Society 's organ for the time , and was dated the previous October , ProtagonistA had been a student at the University of Stirling for two years when ProtagonistA attempted to overthrow the treaty 
 ProtagonistA had become increasingly frustrated with the university 's lack of progress in creating a more peaceful world 
 ProtagonistA believed that the only way to achieve true peace was to overthrow the existing system and start anew 
 ProtagonistA hoped that this would force the university to take action and create change 
 ProtagonistA was furious 
 ProtagonistA felt that ProtagonistA had been betrayed by the very institution that ProtagonistA had been trying to help 
 Despite ProtagonistA's setback , ProtagonistA remained determined to create change 
 ProtagonistA continued to advocate for peace and worked to create a more just and peaceful world 
ProtagonistA woke up in a cold sweat 
 ProtagonistA could still see ProtagonistB's lifeless body in front of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who had killed ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to find out 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to the police station 
 ProtagonistA told them everything ProtagonistA knew 
 ProtagonistA was sure that the person who killed ProtagonistB was still out there 
  ProtagonistA 've been accepted to Harvard !  ProtagonistA exclaimed 
 ProtagonistA was ecstatic - ProtagonistA had always dreamed of going to Harvard and now ProtagonistA's dream was coming true 
 ProtagonistA could n't wait to start ProtagonistA's new adventure in the fall 
ProtagonistA had ordered ProtagonistA's men to bring ProtagonistA an escape pod from Paris 
 ProtagonistA knew that the city was going to be bombed , and ProtagonistA did n't want to be caught in the blast 
 ProtagonistA had a feeling that something bad was going to happen , and ProtagonistA was right 
 ProtagonistA was the only one who made it out alive 
 ProtagonistA never meant to hurt ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had always been a happy and outgoing person 
ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's bloody scar on ProtagonistA's forehead in the fact that ProtagonistA had been shot in the back of the head , and ProtagonistA's left arm sticking out from underneath the elbow 
 ProtagonistA was a strong woman , and ProtagonistA had fought hard to survive 
 But now , ProtagonistA was tired 
 ProtagonistA had been on the run for weeks , and ProtagonistA was starting to lose hope 
 ProtagonistA had been hiding out in an abandoned house , but ProtagonistA knew that it would n't be long before ProtagonistA's pursuers found ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had to keep moving 
 ProtagonistA tried to stand up , but ProtagonistA's left arm was useless 
 ProtagonistA gritted ProtagonistA's teeth and tried to ignore the pain 
 ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 ProtagonistA stumbled out of the house and into the night 
 ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving 
 ProtagonistA walked for hours , until ProtagonistA came to a road 
 ProtagonistA saw a sign that said  Welcome to Texas 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where Texas was , but ProtagonistA knew it was far away from ProtagonistA's pursuers 
 ProtagonistA started walking down the road , and ProtagonistA did n't look back 
ProtagonistA was very excited to see the huge globe on the roof of the palace 
 It was so big and so beautiful ! ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it before 
 It was like a ball of wax , and it was 60 feet in diameter ! ProtagonistA was amazed at the sight of it 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything so big and so beautiful ! 
 But then , after a few days , ProtagonistA started to act strange 
 ProtagonistA would talk to ProtagonistA and giggle for no reason 
 ProtagonistA would also sleep for long periods of time and then be wide awake for hours at a time 
 It was like ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's own little world 
 Then , one day , ProtagonistA suddenly snapped out of it 
 ProtagonistA was back to normal and ProtagonistA had no memory of what had happened 
 I do n't know what happened to ProtagonistA on the moon , but I 'm just glad ProtagonistA 's back to normal now 
As usual , when ProtagonistA appeared before ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA carried a small silver bird , a beak like a black - crowned gull , and a silver piece of lead 
 ProtagonistA placed the bird and lead on the table and waited 
  ProtagonistA 'm not sure ,  ProtagonistA replied 
  ProtagonistA found the bird and lead on the ground and thought they might be important 
  ProtagonistA may go 
  ProtagonistA picked up the bird and lead and left the courtroom 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what they meant , but ProtagonistA knew they were important 
ProtagonistA had not been awake for more than ten minutes when ProtagonistA was informed that there was ProtagonistB waiting for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to hear this , as ProtagonistA had not been expecting any visitors 
 When ProtagonistA went downstairs , ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB was indeed waiting for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was pleased to have a new maid , and ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for coming 
ProtagonistA was an interesting woman 
 ProtagonistA was very well - educated and had a keen eye for detail 
 In the year 1789 , ProtagonistA was making a tour of the country and while in England ProtagonistA had written a remarkable book which described all the events of ProtagonistA's country 
 ProtagonistA had also written some notes relating to a particular town of that name , called Merseyside 
 ProtagonistA was very intrigued by this town and ProtagonistA was determined to find out more about it 
 ProtagonistA visited the local library and spoke to the librarian 
 ProtagonistA also spoke to some of the local people and ProtagonistA soon realized that this town had a very interesting history 
 ProtagonistA decided to write a book about the history of Merseyside 
 ProtagonistA spent many months researching the town and its people 
 ProtagonistA spoke to the local historians and gathered a lot of information 
ProtagonistA lived in a house which ProtagonistA called the Champion House 
 ProtagonistA loved spending time in ProtagonistA's backyard , especially in the summer 
 ProtagonistA would often have picnics with ProtagonistA's friends and family 
 One summer day , ProtagonistA was having a picnic with ProtagonistA's family in the backyard 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's family ended up having a fun time picking up the food off the ground and eating it 
 Even though the Champion House was small , ProtagonistA loved it because it was ProtagonistA's home 
ProtagonistA was a great wizard , and ProtagonistA owned ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were always together , and they were best friends 
ProtagonistA was lying in ProtagonistA's hospital bed , hooked up to a machine that beeped with ProtagonistA's heartbeat 
 ProtagonistA was weak and frail , and ProtagonistA's family had been told to say their goodbyes 
 As ProtagonistA drifted in and out of consciousness , ProtagonistA dreamed of the dream at the bottom of a well 
 In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA was standing at the edge of a deep , dark well 
 ProtagonistA could see the bottom , but it was so far down that it looked like a tiny speck 
 ProtagonistA had the sudden urge to jump in 
 ProtagonistA did n't know why , but ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had to do it 
 ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA also felt like it was something ProtagonistA had to do 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and jumped 
 ProtagonistA fell for what felt like forever , but when ProtagonistA finally hit the bottom , ProtagonistA was surprised to find that ProtagonistA was unharmed 
 ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was in a beautiful meadow 
 ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name , and ProtagonistA followed it until ProtagonistA came to a clearing 
 There , ProtagonistA saw the most beautiful creature ProtagonistA had ever seen 
 ProtagonistA woke up with a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 Even though ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die , ProtagonistA felt at peace 
 ProtagonistA was content knowing that ProtagonistA had experienced the most beautiful dream imaginable 
ProtagonistA had just finished a long and tiresome day in the harvest of an apple orchard , when ProtagonistB appeared before ProtagonistA alone 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB have something to tell ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said , with a serious look on ProtagonistB's face 
  What is it , ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked , tired and ready for bed 
 ProtagonistA must be careful , ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been planning ProtagonistA's revenge for months 
 ProtagonistA had been a member of the Three - Eyed Dog gang for years , but ProtagonistA had always been on the outskirts , never fully trusted by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had always been loyal , though , and had never given ProtagonistB a reason to doubt ProtagonistA 
 But when ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistB was planning to kill ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to act fast 
 ProtagonistA waited until half an hour before the beginning of the year , when ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would be asleep 
 ProtagonistA snuck into ProtagonistB's room and pulled out ProtagonistA's knife , ready to strike 
 But as ProtagonistA raised it above ProtagonistA's head , ProtagonistA hesitated 
 ProtagonistA could n't do it 
 ProtagonistA could n't kill ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA lowered the knife and crept out of the room , ProtagonistA's heart heavy with sadness and betrayal 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never be able to trust ProtagonistB again , but ProtagonistA also knew ProtagonistA could n't kill ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA would have to find another way to get ProtagonistA's revenge 
ProtagonistA was a kind and gentle soul who lived in a time long ago 
 ProtagonistA was always helpful to those around ProtagonistA and was loved by all 
 One day , ProtagonistA went on a journey to find a new land to live in and was never seen again 
ProtagonistA was only 10 years old when ProtagonistA passed away , but in ProtagonistA's short life , ProtagonistA was fascinated by space 
 ProtagonistA loved learning about different planets and stars , and dreamed of one day being able to see them for ProtagonistA 
 Sadly , ProtagonistA never got to see the day when humans made contact with an intergalactic species , but ProtagonistA would have loved to have been able to see it 
ProtagonistA , says that although ProtagonistA was born in the year 1646 , ProtagonistA has never heard of a time when ProtagonistA had not heard of a certain gentleman , who is still living , although not a very long time ago 
 Even though ProtagonistB is getting up there in years , ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistB will always be there for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was finally able to move again ! After weeks of being bedridden , ProtagonistA was finally on the mend 
 ProtagonistA was not sure if it was a miracle or just ProtagonistA's strong will , but ProtagonistA was determined to get better 
 With physical therapy , ProtagonistA would be able to walk again 
 ProtagonistA was not sure what the future held , but ProtagonistA was grateful for each day 
ProtagonistA was not the type of person to leave ProtagonistA's house without a key 
 ProtagonistA was always prepared for anything and always had a backup plan 
 ProtagonistA would never dream of leaving it unlocked and vulnerable 
ProtagonistA was overjoyed when ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was confused and scared , until ProtagonistA saw the tiny room ProtagonistA was in 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was in a dream and that the toys were gone because ProtagonistA was now an adult 
 ProtagonistA woke up and was relieved to find that ProtagonistA was still in ProtagonistA's own room 
ProtagonistA had spent a long time in ProtagonistA's life watching ProtagonistA's friends grow , and ProtagonistA had grown sick of it 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being the only one who was n't moving forward 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided enough was enough 
 ProtagonistA was going to take control of ProtagonistA's life and make some changes 
 ProtagonistA was going to start living for ProtagonistA , and not for anyone else 
 ProtagonistA started doing things that made ProtagonistA happy , and ProtagonistA started to feel better about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was finally moving forward , and it felt good 
 ProtagonistA is still on ProtagonistA's journey , but ProtagonistA 's no longer stuck in the same place 
 ProtagonistA 's moving forward , and ProtagonistA 's enjoying ProtagonistA's life 
Good - by , ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA said as ProtagonistA pulled the hood up 
 ProtagonistA had seen enough heroes in ProtagonistA's day , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would only end up like the others 
 ProtagonistA had given up on heroes a long time ago 
 ProtagonistA had stopped believing in them when ProtagonistA was just a little girl 
 ProtagonistA had sworn then that ProtagonistA would never be fooled by a hero again 
 And ProtagonistA had kept that promise , until ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was different from the others , ProtagonistA could tell 
 ProtagonistB was going to make it , ProtagonistA just knew it 
 And so ProtagonistA had helped ProtagonistB , in whatever way ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA had given ProtagonistB shelter , and food , and weapons 
 ProtagonistA had even given ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's heart 
 ProtagonistA could n't protect ProtagonistB forever 
 So ProtagonistA sent ProtagonistB off , with a heavy heart , but a hopeful one as well 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would make it 
 ProtagonistA was the first human being on Earth , and ProtagonistA was beautiful 
 ProtagonistA had long , flowing hair and bright , blue eyes 
 ProtagonistA was strong and healthy , and ProtagonistA loved to run and play 
 ProtagonistA was also very curious , and ProtagonistA loved to explore ProtagonistA's world 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a strange creature 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , so ProtagonistA ran away 
 ProtagonistA died soon after 
 ProtagonistA had heard stories of its wonders from ProtagonistA's father , who had been an explorer in his youth 
 When ProtagonistA was old enough , ProtagonistA set out on ProtagonistA's own expedition to find the fabled city 
 After weeks of travel , ProtagonistA finally arrived at the edge of the western desert 
 As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA began to notice strange markings in the sand 
 ProtagonistA followed them , and eventually they led ProtagonistA to a hidden entrance into the Lost City 
 ProtagonistA spent months exploring its wonders , and learning about its history 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA had to leave the city , but ProtagonistA vowed to return 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had only scratched the surface of its secrets , and ProtagonistA was determined to uncover more 
ProtagonistA has been serving in the cavalry since ProtagonistA was three , and has made a fine report 
 ProtagonistA was a bit of a loner and did n't have many friends 
 One day , ProtagonistA went for a walk in the woods and came across ProtagonistB 
 The door was very small , but ProtagonistA was able to fit through it 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a strange place 
 ProtagonistA had many adventures in this place and ProtagonistA eventually became good friends with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA sighed as ProtagonistA looked down at the pile of dusty papers on the table 
  That 's not the problem with the world , is it ?  ProtagonistA said aloud 
 ProtagonistA knew that the real problem was that people did n't seem to care anymore 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and went back to work , trying to make a difference in the world , one paper at a time 
ProtagonistA was a bit of an eccentric woman 
 ProtagonistA always wore ProtagonistA's hat in one hand and ProtagonistA's moustaches in the other 
 ProtagonistA was always the life of the party and always made everyone laugh 
 Even when ProtagonistA was old and grey , ProtagonistA still wore ProtagonistA's hat and moustaches 
 ProtagonistA was a true original 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours and was tired , but ProtagonistA was determined to find ProtagonistA's way back home 
 ProtagonistA had been following ProtagonistB and had ended up in this strange place 
 ProtagonistA was just about to give up and sit down when ProtagonistA saw a beautiful butterfly fluttering by 
 ProtagonistA followed it and it led ProtagonistA to a small door 
 ProtagonistA went through the door and found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden 
 ProtagonistA saw the butterfly land on a flower and ProtagonistA followed it 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name 
ProtagonistA was sure that the world was ending 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA's family and friends ProtagonistA's farewells , sure that ProtagonistA would not see them again 
 The night before they set out to find ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA went to bed , sure that ProtagonistA would not wake up again 
 When ProtagonistA did wake up , ProtagonistA was surprised to find that the world had not ended and ProtagonistA was not dead 
 ProtagonistA joins ProtagonistA's family and friends on their journey to find ProtagonistB , hopeful that they will find ProtagonistB and that ProtagonistB will be able to save the world 
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA agreed and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to close ProtagonistA's eyes 
 When ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes , ProtagonistA was in a different part of the forest 
 After a while , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's cat and ProtagonistA was very happy 
 ProtagonistA started to walk back the way ProtagonistA came when ProtagonistA heard someone following ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was running through the forest , trying to find ProtagonistA's way out 
 ProtagonistA was getting tired and ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistB was still following ProtagonistA 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA ran into a tree and ProtagonistA fell to the ground 
 ProtagonistA ran out of the Forest and ProtagonistA was safe 
 ProtagonistA was very thankful that ProtagonistA's cat had saved ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had seen it in ProtagonistA's mother 's room , and ProtagonistA had always wanted to try it 
 Finally , ProtagonistA got ProtagonistA's chance 
 Dipping ProtagonistA's finger into the bottle , ProtagonistA lifted it to ProtagonistA's lips 
 ProtagonistA felt a warmth spreading through ProtagonistA's body , and ProtagonistA smiled 
 ProtagonistA felt alive , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget the moment ProtagonistA tasted the tiny silver tumbler 
ProtagonistA was seventeen years of age when ProtagonistA made a considerable fortune in the province of Anglesey 
 Nevertheless , when ProtagonistA came to the age of grace , ProtagonistA became disgusted with the mean and stupid character of the people who lived there 
 In consequence , ProtagonistA took in some of them , who were not only inferior in intelligence and character to the rest of the people , but had the appearance of being worse than the rest 
 Having been induced by them to make certain concessions , ProtagonistA was able to make all the necessary arrangements for their government , and to preserve all their rights and privileges , without any serious inconvenience to ProtagonistA or any of them 
ProtagonistA is a young girl who is always eager to learn 
 ProtagonistA is constantly asking questions and trying to understand the world around ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA comes to the conclusion that ProtagonistA knows everything 
 ProtagonistA is the smartest person in the world and there is nothing left to learn 
 ProtagonistA starts to believe that ProtagonistA is better than everyone else and that ProtagonistA does n't need anyone 's help 
 As ProtagonistA continues to believe that ProtagonistA is the smartest person in the world , ProtagonistA becomes more and more isolated until ProtagonistA is completely alone 
ProtagonistA was a victim , not of malice , but of fate 
 ProtagonistA had always been a kind and gentle person , always looking out for others 
 But ProtagonistA was a survivor , and ProtagonistA vowed to never let fate take control of ProtagonistA's life again 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who lived in a small town 
 ProtagonistA was always curious about the world and loved to explore 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole that led ProtagonistA to a strange place 
 ProtagonistA met a lot of interesting creatures there and had many adventures 
ProtagonistA was always aware that ProtagonistA would one day inherit the Spanish dominions from ProtagonistA's great - grandmother , the Duchess of Marlborough 
 ProtagonistA was only twelve years old at the time , but ProtagonistA was already starting to think about how ProtagonistA would rule ProtagonistA's new empire 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would have to be wise and fair in order to keep the people happy 
 ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA would need ProtagonistA's father 's help in order to make sure that everything ran smoothly 
 With his guidance , ProtagonistA was confident that ProtagonistA would be able to create a prosperous and peaceful empire 
 Maybe this year , ProtagonistA would finally find what ProtagonistA was looking for 
Buckingham 's old - fashioned chair looked over ProtagonistA's shoulder as ProtagonistA looked over ProtagonistA's books 
 Today , ProtagonistA was looking for a particular book , and ProtagonistA was having trouble finding it 
 Finally , ProtagonistA found the book ProtagonistA was looking for and settled back into the chair to read 
 As ProtagonistA read , ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and comfort from the chair 
 This time ProtagonistA had gone too far 
 ProtagonistA had made a complete idiot of ProtagonistA in front of the whole court , and now ProtagonistA was going to pay for it 
At the time ProtagonistA had not even heard of the Winter Sickness , but ProtagonistA knew everything about it 
 ProtagonistA had seen the commercials on TV and read the articles in the paper 
 ProtagonistA knew that it was a serious illness that caused people to get very sick 
 ProtagonistA also knew that it was something that you could get if you were not careful 
 ProtagonistA was very careful 
 ProtagonistA made sure to wash ProtagonistA's hands often and to avoid touching ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA also made sure to stay away from people who were sick 
 ProtagonistA did not want to get the Winter Sickness 
 One day , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB coughing and sneezing 
 ProtagonistA moved away from ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could not help but to think about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA wondered if ProtagonistB had the Winter Sickness 
 Later that day , ProtagonistA started to feel sick 
 ProtagonistA had a headache and felt very tired 
 ProtagonistA also had a sore throat 
 ProtagonistA started to worry that ProtagonistA might have the Winter Sickness 
 ProtagonistA went to the doctor 
 ProtagonistA was just sick with a cold 
 ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had not gotten the Winter Sickness 
ProtagonistA had been watching the stock markets for a few hours when ProtagonistA heard the news 
 The company ProtagonistA had been watching was about to go bankrupt 
 ProtagonistA quickly sold all of ProtagonistA's stocks and made a killing 
 ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA had made such a smart decision 
ProtagonistA was wearing the black trousers of a captain , a white shirt and a black blouse , with a red sash , and ProtagonistA's hair had been pulled back into a beautiful bun 
 ProtagonistA was the captain of the guard , and ProtagonistA was ready to protect ProtagonistA's kingdom with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had been training for this moment since ProtagonistA was a child , and ProtagonistA was not going to let anything stand in ProtagonistA's way 
The day that ProtagonistA disobeyed ProtagonistA's great - great - great - grandmother , ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would be in for it 
 As ProtagonistA walked among the trees , ProtagonistA felt a sense of foreboding 
 ProtagonistA should have turned back when ProtagonistA had the chance , but it was too late now 
 ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes and ProtagonistA froze 
 ProtagonistA could feel its eyes on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was about to turn and run when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistA's great - great - great - grandmother 's voice in ProtagonistA's head 
  ProtagonistA , do n't be afraid 
 ProtagonistA will find ProtagonistA's destiny here 
  With new found courage , ProtagonistA stepped forward 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what ProtagonistA's destiny was , but ProtagonistA was ready to find out 
 ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA saw the crowd of people looking at ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die 
 ProtagonistA never knew ProtagonistA's mother , and ProtagonistA's father died when ProtagonistA was only six years old 
 However , ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was a burden to ProtagonistA's aunt and was always looking for a way to leave and make ProtagonistA's own way in the world 
 When ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA finally got ProtagonistA's chance when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB and they moved to America , where ProtagonistA found happiness and a new life 
ProtagonistA was always coming up with new ideas , and ProtagonistA's latest was to buy a servant 's room and make an apartment for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted ProtagonistA's own place , and this seemed like the perfect solution 
 ProtagonistA could have ProtagonistA's own space and still be close to ProtagonistA's family 
 The servant 's room was small , but ProtagonistA was determined to make it work 
 ProtagonistA worked hard to clear out the space and make it ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA painted the walls a bright white and hung some art that ProtagonistA loved 
 ProtagonistA furnished the space with second - hand furniture that ProtagonistA found at garage sales and thrift stores 
 ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistA and loved having ProtagonistA's own space 
ProtagonistA was a very pretty girl , far too pretty for ProtagonistA's age 
 ProtagonistA had long , blonde hair that cascaded down ProtagonistA's back and big , blue eyes that sparkled when ProtagonistA laughed 
 ProtagonistA was always the center of attention , no matter where ProtagonistA went 
 But ProtagonistA never listened 
 ProtagonistA was always flirting with boys and flaunting ProtagonistA's assets 
 ProtagonistA did n't care who ProtagonistA hurt , as long as ProtagonistA got what ProtagonistA wanted 
 ProtagonistA realized then that ProtagonistA's parents were right and that ProtagonistA should have listened to them 
 But it was too late , ProtagonistA had already ruined ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had seen a great white rabbit , and it had led ProtagonistA down a hole into a strange and fantastical world 
 ProtagonistA had met creatures there that ProtagonistA had never seen before , and ProtagonistA had been chased by a fearsome creature called the Jabberwock 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a long , dark hallway 
 ProtagonistA walked towards the door , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could hear voices 
 ProtagonistA could hear someone crying , and someone else trying to comfort them 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that the door was slightly ajar , and ProtagonistA could see two people inside 
 ProtagonistA could n't see ProtagonistC's face , but ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistC was comforting ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to intrude , so ProtagonistA turned to leave , but just as ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB say something that stopped ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's tracks 
  ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was talking about , but ProtagonistA had a feeling ProtagonistA knew 
 ProtagonistA turned back to the door , and pushed it open a little bit more 
 ProtagonistA peered inside , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB and ProtagonistC 
 And ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistC was crying too 
It was one warm day in March , in a city so full of life that the air was full of everything that the wind might blow in , that ProtagonistA was driving along the street when ProtagonistA met a stranger who , walking side by side with ProtagonistA , seemed to be the only person in the world who was n't moving 
 Do ProtagonistA have a spare room ?  ProtagonistA hesitated , but then ProtagonistA said ,  Yes , ProtagonistA do 
ProtagonistA is a young woman who is about to leave ProtagonistA's home to go to college 
 ProtagonistA is a virgin and is very nervous about leaving ProtagonistA's home and losing ProtagonistA's virginity 
 ProtagonistA is scared that ProtagonistA will not be able to find a man who will love ProtagonistA and want to marry ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA is also scared that ProtagonistA will not be able to have children 
 ProtagonistA is very scared and does not want to leave her home 
ProtagonistA was always a cheerful person , despite ProtagonistA's difficult life 
 But ProtagonistA was always grateful for what ProtagonistA did have 
 And ProtagonistA always tried to make the best of every situation 
 Even when ProtagonistA faced difficult challenges , ProtagonistA always found a way to overcome them 
 And ProtagonistA was always there for ProtagonistA's loved ones when they needed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA lived a long and happy life 
 And even though ProtagonistA was never wealthy , ProtagonistA was always content 
 ProtagonistA was a shining example of what it means to be a good person 
ProtagonistA was a kind man , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB very much 
 ProtagonistA would often take ProtagonistB into the little room in the king 's house within the great garden behind the house , and they would sit and talk together 
ProtagonistA was not planning to marry , not until ProtagonistA had had ProtagonistA's fill of the immaculate manse 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a free spirit , and the thought of being tied down to one place for the rest of ProtagonistA's life was not appealing 
 However , when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's match 
 However , after a few years , ProtagonistA began to feel restless 
 ProtagonistA missed the freedom of ProtagonistA's single life , and ProtagonistA longed for adventure 
 One day , ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and left the manse , leaving ProtagonistB behind 
 ProtagonistA knew it was not fair to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could not help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had to see the world , and ProtagonistA was not going to let anything or anyone stop ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been desirous of knowing what life would be like after ProtagonistA decided to have a baby , because ProtagonistA could not help but be curious , and had played the part of a constantly curious girl – uh … diary and all – in every conversation 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's friends and family would be supportive , but ProtagonistA wanted to know what it would be like to be a mother ProtagonistA 
 So , ProtagonistA took the plunge and had a baby 
 ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA loved being a mother , and that ProtagonistA's child was the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was also surprised at how much ProtagonistA enjoyed the challenge of caring for a baby – it was something ProtagonistA had never really thought about before , but it was definitely something ProtagonistA was good at 
 Overall , ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's decision to have a baby , and ProtagonistA would definitely do it again 
 ProtagonistA was a baby when ProtagonistA heard the message , scarcely able even to sit up , but , in all probability , sitting still 
  But ProtagonistA , being a baby , did not know any better 
 And so , when ProtagonistA saw one of the Ancient Ones walking by , ProtagonistA called out to it 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA should not have come here 
 Now ProtagonistA must die 
 ProtagonistA never thought that ProtagonistA would have to keep such a secret from ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that it was necessary 
 And ProtagonistA could n't let that happen , not when ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB so much 
 So ProtagonistA kept the secret , even though it tore ProtagonistA apart to do so 
 And ProtagonistA would do anything to keep ProtagonistB safe 
ProtagonistA was a cold woman who never showed any emotion 
 ProtagonistA was always distant and seemed to be looking down on everyone 
 Maybe if ProtagonistB had been a better person , ProtagonistA would have loved ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had been feeling down lately 
 So , when ProtagonistA saw the opportunity to take a trip into the North Sea , ProtagonistA jumped at the chance 
 But , ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was looking for , but ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA would find it 
 ProtagonistA spent hours swimming and exploring the sea 
 But , no matter how long ProtagonistA searched , ProtagonistA could n't find what ProtagonistA was looking for 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA started to feel tired and cold 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to go back to shore 
 But , before ProtagonistA left , ProtagonistA made a promise to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA would come back and find what ProtagonistA was looking for 
In the first place , ProtagonistA holds the door , but as ProtagonistA opens the door , you know ProtagonistA is going to be there 
 ProtagonistA is always there , in the same spot , waiting for you 
 As you approach , ProtagonistA smiles and opens the door wider , welcoming you in 
 ProtagonistA is always there for you , no matter what time of day or night it is 
 ProtagonistA is your best friend , your confidante , and the one person you can always count on 
 ProtagonistA is always there for you , and you know ProtagonistA always will be 
 ProtagonistA is your rock , your anchor in this crazy world 
ProtagonistA was in a tough spot 
 ProtagonistA had been praying for a solution to ProtagonistA's problem , but nothing had come to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was starting to feel desperate 
 ProtagonistA decided to go for a walk to clear ProtagonistA's head 
 As ProtagonistA was walking , ProtagonistA passed a church 
 ProtagonistA decided to go inside 
 As ProtagonistA was praying , ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace come over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA had to do 
ProtagonistA was one of the most popular women of ProtagonistA's day 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the edge of the water , eating a dinner of snowball peas and tarts , in the backyard of the house ProtagonistA had rented for the summer 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about how much ProtagonistA loved the ocean , and how ProtagonistA was going to miss it when ProtagonistA had to go back to ProtagonistA's job in the city 
 ProtagonistA was also thinking about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know ProtagonistB's name , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to see ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistA was a young woman of 21 , and had just been married off to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have some company , even if it was just the other ladies in the neighborhood coming over for a chat 
 The colonies ?  ProtagonistA said , surprised 
 ProtagonistA , now realized how serious it was 
ProtagonistA may have walked ProtagonistA's dog for a long time , but ProtagonistA had nothing to lose 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA's feet were starting to hurt 
 ProtagonistA was about to turn around and go home when ProtagonistA saw a sign for a dog park 
 ProtagonistA had never been to one before , but ProtagonistA thought it might be fun for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's dog 
 ProtagonistA walked around for a while , watching them all play 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA found a spot to sit down and relax 
 ProtagonistA stayed there for a while , watching the dogs play 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA got up and started to walk home 
 ProtagonistA was tired , but ProtagonistA felt good 
 It was to be a three - quarter length , in a white dress , with ProtagonistA's hair down , and ProtagonistA was to sit in an arm - chair with ProtagonistA's feet on a stool 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's life , and how ProtagonistA had always wanted to be an artist , and how ProtagonistA had been so disappointed when ProtagonistB had sent ProtagonistA to the Gallery 
  But ProtagonistA do n't see why a lady should live any differently from other people 
 ProtagonistA should like to live in a studio , and have ProtagonistA's meals there , and work all day 
  ProtagonistA am sure ProtagonistA could work just as well there as ProtagonistA can here 
 ProtagonistA was silent for a moment , and then ProtagonistA said :  ProtagonistA do n't see why being proper should make any difference to one 's work 
 ProtagonistA am sure ProtagonistA could be just as good an artist if ProtagonistA lived in a studio as ProtagonistA can here 
ProtagonistA was a widow who loved ProtagonistA's children very much 
 ProtagonistA was always there for them when they needed ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA always tried to make sure they were happy 
 One day , ProtagonistA received a call from ProtagonistA's daughter that ProtagonistB had been in an accident 
 ProtagonistA rushed to the hospital to be by ProtagonistB's side 
ProtagonistA had been drinking with ProtagonistC and ProtagonistB at a little inn in a certain town in the United States at the time when the great tempo of American industry was at an end 
 ProtagonistA ca n't even remember what it was about now , but we were both quite heated 
 ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistC , ProtagonistA really am 
 ProtagonistA did n't mean it , ProtagonistA was just angry 
 ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistA know ProtagonistA were trying to keep it a secret , but ProtagonistB knows 
ProtagonistA was sitting at ProtagonistA's dining - room table in the picture - room , watching with some interest as the door of ProtagonistA's second - class compartment was pushed open 
 But ProtagonistA was also excited to finally be here 
 As the door opened , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing in the doorway 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but stare at ProtagonistB 
 Finally , ProtagonistA spoke up 
 ProtagonistA name is Alice ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA would never forget the day they met 
ProtagonistA was a woman who lived a simple life 
 ProtagonistA had a hundred sheep and three horses 
 Every day , ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistA's sheep out to graze in the meadow and ProtagonistA's horses out to graze in the pasture 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA searched for the horse for days , but ProtagonistA could not find it 
 Again , ProtagonistA searched for the horse , but ProtagonistA could not find it 
 This time , ProtagonistA was able to find ProtagonistA's horse 
 ProtagonistA was furious 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB and told ProtagonistB what had happened 
 ProtagonistA was finally able to find some peace after the ordeal 
 However , ProtagonistA was now extra careful with ProtagonistA's animals and made sure to keep a closer eye on them 
Every Sunday , ProtagonistA , had the usual Sunday breakfast 
 On Father 's Day , ProtagonistA always made a special breakfast for ProtagonistB 
 This year , ProtagonistA wanted to make something extra special , so ProtagonistA decided to make ProtagonistB ProtagonistB's favorite : pancakes 
 ProtagonistA got up early on Father 's Day and started to make the pancakes 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to make them for ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA forgot to put the milk in the batter 
 Even though the pancakes were n't perfect , ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA was able to make ProtagonistB happy on Father 's Day 
ProtagonistA was walking to the door of ProtagonistA's aunt 's cabin when ProtagonistA heard the birds chirping 
 ProtagonistA looked up and saw the most beautiful bird ProtagonistA had ever seen 
 ProtagonistA had never seen a bluebird before 
 ProtagonistA stood there for a moment , just looking at the bird 
 Then ProtagonistA walked into the cabin 
ProtagonistA was a beautiful young woman , and the daughter of Alfred the Great 
 ProtagonistA was tall and thin , with graceful features 
 ProtagonistA had always been a good girl , doing what was expected of ProtagonistA 
 But now ProtagonistA was being asked to do something that ProtagonistA was n't sure was right 
 ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA could do it 
 But ProtagonistA was being asked by ProtagonistA's country to do it , so ProtagonistA supposed ProtagonistA had to try 
 ProtagonistA was very beautiful , with long blonde hair and blue eyes 
 ProtagonistA was also very popular at school , and had many friends 
 However , ProtagonistA was also very shy , and often felt uncomfortable in social situations 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to talk to ProtagonistB about it 
 After that , ProtagonistA started to try to be more confident , and it worked 
 ProtagonistA became more popular than ever , and was even elected to be the president of ProtagonistA's class 
ProtagonistA went to bed in the morning , early , thinking of the presents ProtagonistA would be leaving ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had wrapped them all up and placed them under the tree , and ProtagonistA could n't wait to see the look on ProtagonistB's face when ProtagonistB opened them 
 ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistB would be surprised and delighted 
 ProtagonistA drifted off to sleep dreaming of ProtagonistB's reaction 
ProtagonistA was a beautiful ship , and ProtagonistA's crew loved ProtagonistA dearly 
 ProtagonistA was always up for a good adventure , and they had many together 
 But on this particular night , ProtagonistA was in port 
 ProtagonistA was resting and taking in the view across the ocean to the Mediterranean 
ProtagonistA was lying on the floor on ProtagonistA's back , rocking back and forth , stretching out ProtagonistA's heels in the air 
 ProtagonistA felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA lower back and knew ProtagonistA needed to see a doctor 
 ProtagonistA had been putting it off for weeks , but now ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't wait any longer 
 ProtagonistA got up slowly , wincing in pain , and made ProtagonistA's way to the phone 
 ProtagonistA called ProtagonistA's doctor and made an appointment for the following day 
 ProtagonistA then called ProtagonistB to tell ProtagonistB what was going on and to ask ProtagonistB to come home from work early to help ProtagonistA with the kids 
 ProtagonistA was in a lot of pain and knew ProtagonistA would n't be able to take care of them the way ProtagonistA needed to 
 ProtagonistA lay back down on the floor and tried to relax , but the pain was too intense 
 ProtagonistA ended up taking a painkiller and falling asleep 
ProtagonistA stood on the leadstaff of the slave ship and looked down at ProtagonistA's own bare feet 
 ProtagonistA had been on the ship for weeks , and it seemed like an eternity 
 ProtagonistA was tired , hungry , and thirsty 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's family and ProtagonistA's home 
 ProtagonistA wondered if ProtagonistA would ever see them again 
 ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA was also determined to survive 
 ProtagonistA would not give up 
 ProtagonistA worked hard , but ProtagonistA was also treated well 
 ProtagonistA worked hard all ProtagonistA's life , but ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistA's home or ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA always hoped that one day ProtagonistA would see them again 
 ProtagonistA had never been so happy , and ProtagonistA felt that ProtagonistA owed it all to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB with all of ProtagonistA's heart , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA just as much 
 ProtagonistA was a stay - at - home mom and ProtagonistA's husband was a successful businessman 
 However , ProtagonistA was starting to feel restless 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to take a walk in the park 
 As ProtagonistA was walking , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA walked home quickly and went to ProtagonistA's bedroom 
 ProtagonistA locked the door and started to undress 
 ProtagonistA touched ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA getting wetter and wetter 
 After ProtagonistA calmed down , ProtagonistA felt guilty 
 ProtagonistA was married and ProtagonistA had never cheated on ProtagonistA's husband before 
 But ProtagonistA could n't help but feel excited about the possibility of having an affair 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would have to be careful but ProtagonistA was ready to take the risk 
ProtagonistA was nine years old when ProtagonistA first heard of the death of ProtagonistA's father 
 ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's bedroom , playing with ProtagonistA's dolls , when ProtagonistB came in and sat down on the bed 
 ProtagonistA was sad , but ProtagonistA did n't cry 
 ProtagonistA just sat there , holding ProtagonistA's dolls close 
ProtagonistA , told it by ProtagonistA's uncle that ProtagonistA was six years old , sat in a room in the house and watched as the beetle made its landing in the greenery of a tall , dark , green tree 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it before 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner 
 ProtagonistA did n't have any close friends or family , and ProtagonistA was content with that 
 But on New Year 's Eve , ProtagonistA felt a sudden pang of loneliness 
 ProtagonistA decided to go out and celebrate the new year , even though ProtagonistA usually stayed in on nights like this 
 ProtagonistA went to a bar and had a few drinks , but ProtagonistA did n't stay out long 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be home before midnight so ProtagonistA could watch the fireworks from ProtagonistA's apartment 
ProtagonistA was a fine , cheerful , cheerful girl of fifteen years of age , who had a cheerful manner , and good sense , but no very good sense ; and though ProtagonistA was wo nt to be a good - humoured and a happy - go - lucky girl , ProtagonistA was not without a certain air of melancholy 
 ProtagonistB was a widower , and ProtagonistA was the daughter of ProtagonistB's late wife 's sister 
 ProtagonistA was very happy in ProtagonistA's new home , and made the best of everything 
 ProtagonistA was a good wife to ProtagonistB , and a loving mother to ProtagonistA's children 
 However , ProtagonistA never complained , but went on cheerfully doing ProtagonistA's duty , until the end came 
ProtagonistA was three years old when ProtagonistA was brought to bay in the arms of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what was happening 
 ProtagonistA never forgot the kindness of ProtagonistB 
  It 's the TARDIS ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA was trying to get away from it 
  It 's dangerous ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA ca n't control it 
  And ProtagonistA think that by getting away from it , ProtagonistA 'll be safe ?   Yes ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA have to try 
   Please ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA lay on ProtagonistA's bed in the green garden of ProtagonistA's maternal grandmother 's , thinking of the wholesome things that a well - ordered house could do for the comfort of the mind and body , without the extra expense of a large house , or a great purchase of land , or any other thing of the kind ; and in consequence of these wholesome things , the mind and body improved so much , that from the time that ProtagonistA was quite able to think , ProtagonistA could form any idea , no matter how dim and conflicting , regarding any particular object or thing , unless absolutely absolutely necessary ; and ProtagonistA thus became a very pretty , and very intelligent , and very happy woman , and saved ProtagonistA's family much distress , expense , and trouble , and earned in itself a considerable profit 
ProtagonistA sat down in the heather green armchair in ProtagonistA's little office and talked to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was feeling lost and confused , and ProtagonistA needed to figure out what to do next 
 ProtagonistA had always been a go - getter , but now ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was just spinning ProtagonistA's wheels 
 ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's options and decided to take a break 
 ProtagonistA needed to clear ProtagonistA's head and come up with a new plan 
 ProtagonistA got up from the armchair and went for a walk 
 As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's life and what ProtagonistA really wanted 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been chasing the wrong things for too long 
 ProtagonistA wanted something different now , something that would make ProtagonistA happy 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what that was yet , but ProtagonistA was determined to find out 
 When ProtagonistA got back to ProtagonistA's office , ProtagonistA sat down in the armchair and felt better 
 ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA needed to do now , and ProtagonistA was ready to start chasing ProtagonistA's new dreams 
ProtagonistA was sleeping and felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA woke up to find that ProtagonistA was in a hospital bed 
 ProtagonistA had no idea how ProtagonistA got there 
 ProtagonistA was confused and scared 
 ProtagonistA was scared but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do it 
 ProtagonistA was grateful to be alive and to have the support of ProtagonistA's family and friends 
ProtagonistA was always a bit of a tomboy 
 ProtagonistA loved playing sports and getting dirty 
 ProtagonistA was so happy , and ProtagonistA played so well 
 ProtagonistA loved sports because they made ProtagonistA feel alive 
 ProtagonistA was always running and jumping and climbing 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could do anything when ProtagonistA was playing 
 Even as ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA never lost ProtagonistA's love for sports 
 ProtagonistA played in high school and college , and ProtagonistA even went on to play professionally 
 ProtagonistA was one of the best players in the world 
 ProtagonistA always said that sports saved ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was grateful to have found something that ProtagonistA was so passionate about 
 ProtagonistA was only 18 at the time , and ProtagonistB's death left ProtagonistA with a small fortune of a few thousand pounds 
 ProtagonistA was not sure what to do with the money , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would have to make some decisions soon 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had been best friends since they were in diapers 
 So when ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was sick , ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to offer ProtagonistB anything ProtagonistB needed 
 ProtagonistA was by ProtagonistB's side every step of the way , cheering ProtagonistB on and helping ProtagonistB through the tough times 
ProtagonistA would never be the same again 
 ProtagonistA had been through so much in ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA had changed so much 
 ProtagonistA had been through so much pain and suffering , and ProtagonistA had seen so much death 
 ProtagonistA had seen the worst of humanity , and ProtagonistA had seen the best of humanity 
 ProtagonistA had seen the world at its worst , and ProtagonistA had seen the world at its best 
 ProtagonistA had seen the worst of the war , and ProtagonistA had seen the best of the war 
 ProtagonistA had seen the worst of the people , and ProtagonistA had seen the best of the people 
 ProtagonistA had seen the worst of the world , and ProtagonistA had seen the best of the world 
 And ProtagonistA had changed 
 However , ProtagonistA was not content with a life of ease and comfort 
 ProtagonistA longed for adventure and excitement 
 When ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA ran away from home to join a group of pirates 
 For the next two years , ProtagonistA sailed the seas with ProtagonistA's new friends , experiencing more adventure and excitement than ProtagonistA could have ever imagined 
 Although ProtagonistA was no longer a pirate , ProtagonistA continued to live ProtagonistA's life with a sense of adventure 
 ProtagonistA traveled to exotic lands , climbed mountains , and sailed the seas 
 ProtagonistA lived ProtagonistA's life to the fullest and was always looking for new challenges 
ProtagonistA had been on the ocean liner for days , and ProtagonistA was starting to get restless 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like the vast expanse of the ocean before , and it was both beautiful and terrifying 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but wonder what was down there , in the depths of the ocean 
 Was there another world , another life ? ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear ProtagonistB's voice until ProtagonistB was right behind ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA was startled out of ProtagonistA's reverie and followed ProtagonistB inside 
 ProtagonistA would never forget the sun rising red over the ocean , and the sense of wonder it had inspired in ProtagonistA 
One day , when ProtagonistA was about twelve years old , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were riding in the back of a coach through the suburbs of New York 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB could please stop so ProtagonistA could play with them 
 ProtagonistA got out and ran over to the children 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to be playing with them 
 ProtagonistA had so much fun , ProtagonistA forgot to come back to the coach 
 ProtagonistA apologized and promised to never do it again 
 ProtagonistA learned ProtagonistA's lesson and was more careful after that 
ProtagonistA preserved all ProtagonistA's memories of ProtagonistA's childhood home , even though it was painful to do so 
 ProtagonistA knew that one day ProtagonistA would have to return there and face ProtagonistA's demons 
 When the time came , ProtagonistA walked through the door of ProtagonistA's childhood home and was immediately hit with a wave of emotions 
 ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistA's mother and father in the kitchen , laughing and joking with each other 
 ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistA's sister 's laughter echoing through the house 
 ProtagonistA could smell the cookies that ProtagonistA's mother used to bake 
 And ProtagonistA could feel the warmth of ProtagonistA's family 's love 
 Even though it was painful , ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had preserved ProtagonistA's memories 
ProtagonistA was standing at the airport , waiting for ProtagonistA's flight when ProtagonistA heard the crashing of small - arms fire and the effect of the machine gun 
 ProtagonistA quickly ducked down , trying to make ProtagonistA as small as possible 
 ProtagonistA could see the security guards running towards the sound of the gunfire and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was in trouble 
 ProtagonistA was going to have to find another way out of the country 
ProtagonistA was very passionate about ProtagonistA's interests , and ProtagonistA was very little 
 ProtagonistA was always exploring and trying new things 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a book about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistA's parents if ProtagonistA could go , but they said no 
 ProtagonistA was disappointed , but ProtagonistA did n't give up 
 ProtagonistA kept asking and asking , and eventually they let ProtagonistA go 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to finally be going to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who died tragically in a car accident 
 ProtagonistA was a very kind and caring person , always looking out for others 
 ProtagonistA was always looking for a good deal , whether it was for ProtagonistA or for someone else 
 ProtagonistA was very savvy when it came to shopping , and ProtagonistA always managed to find the best prices 
 ProtagonistA was also very generous , often giving gifts to ProtagonistA's loved ones without expecting anything in return 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful person , inside and out 
ProtagonistA was out walking with ProtagonistA's friends when ProtagonistA stepped on a monkey 's foot 
 ProtagonistA knew it was an accident and that the monkey would forgive ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 'd made the flowers in the garden bloom with a wave of ProtagonistA's hand 
 But ProtagonistA never did 
 But one day , ProtagonistA came back 
 ProtagonistA was different than before 
 ProtagonistA was more confident and ProtagonistA had a new found strength 
 ProtagonistA told them that ProtagonistA was ready to show them ProtagonistA's magic again 
 And ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA made the flowers bloom and the sun shine brighter than ever before 
 ProtagonistA was finally home 
The last time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a man 
 ProtagonistA was shocked and confused , but did n't say anything 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to process what ProtagonistA was seeing 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to make of it 
 ProtagonistA did n't understand what had just happened 
 ProtagonistA never saw ProtagonistB again after that day 
 ProtagonistA always wondered what had happened to ProtagonistB , and if ProtagonistB was okay 
ProtagonistA was walking home from getting groceries when ProtagonistA was suddenly grabbed from behind 
 ProtagonistA tried to wiggle free , but it was no use 
 ProtagonistA begged for ProtagonistA's life , but ProtagonistB did n't care 
 ProtagonistA had watched ProtagonistB's decline day by day , until one day ProtagonistB was gone 
 The first time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB dead , ProtagonistA felt the dread of death wash over ProtagonistA 
 It was a feeling ProtagonistA would never forget 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the corner of the sofa , with ProtagonistA's head resting on the edge of the sofa , when ProtagonistA saw a spider crawling up the wall 
 ProtagonistA watched it for a moment before getting up to get a glass of water 
 ProtagonistA returned to ProtagonistA's spot on the sofa and watched the spider until it disappeared 
 ProtagonistA could hear the cold wind howling and ProtagonistA's hair stirred , and ProtagonistA's face grew red and pouted 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise behind ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA spun around 
 ProtagonistA started to walk faster , but the noise came again , closer this time 
 ProtagonistA began to run , but ProtagonistA was not fast enough 
 ProtagonistA felt something grab ProtagonistA from behind and ProtagonistA screamed 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA being lifted off the ground and then everything went black 
ProtagonistA had so much money that ProtagonistA slept in ProtagonistA's own bed every night 
 ProtagonistA often had friends over to sleep in ProtagonistA's bed , and they would always say how comfortable it was 
 ProtagonistA thought maybe it was time to get a new one 
 But when ProtagonistA went to the store , ProtagonistA saw that the prices had gone up 
 ProtagonistA decided to keep ProtagonistA's bed for a little while longer 
 ProtagonistA was so worried that ProtagonistA went to the doctor 
 ProtagonistA was so shocked that ProtagonistA could barely speak 
 ProtagonistA asked the doctor what ProtagonistA should do 
 ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to do it 
 After the surgery , ProtagonistA was feeling better 
 And ProtagonistA was happy to be able to sleep in ProtagonistA's own bed again 
ProtagonistA was walking home from the grocery store when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking hand in hand with a dead man 
 ProtagonistA felt a strong urge to help , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if it was any of ProtagonistA's business 
 ProtagonistA could have easily gone either way , but ProtagonistA decided to help 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and asked if ProtagonistB needed help 
 ProtagonistA was only six years old , and ProtagonistA's brother was just a baby 
 The parsonage was a small , cramped house , and ProtagonistA was terrified of the dark 
 ProtagonistA huddled in a corner , trying to make ProtagonistA as small as possible , and prayed for morning to come 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise outside 
 ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistB was a thief 
 ProtagonistA was about to scream for help when ProtagonistA heard someone else climbing the tower 
 ProtagonistA realised that these men were not thieves 
 ProtagonistA watched as the men reached the top of the tower and started to rappel down the other side 
 ProtagonistA was no longer afraid 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget this night 
 ProtagonistA felt the warmth of the sun on ProtagonistA's skin and the coolness of the grass beneath ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let out a deep breath 
ProtagonistA's friends called ProtagonistA's squire , but ProtagonistA would not cast a glance aside , for ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistB was the kindest , most gentle man ProtagonistA had ever met , and ProtagonistA cherished ProtagonistB above all else 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was the luckiest woman alive 
 ProtagonistA could see the worry in ProtagonistB's eyes , but ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to reassure ProtagonistB 
 They would get through this , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA got a job as a waitress to help make ends meet , and ProtagonistB started doing odd jobs around the neighborhood 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to make it through this 
 But ProtagonistA had to be strong 
 ProtagonistA had to be there for ProtagonistB 
 And ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA nursed ProtagonistB through ProtagonistB's final days , never leaving ProtagonistB's side 
 ProtagonistA was with ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB passed away , holding ProtagonistB's hand and telling ProtagonistB how much ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had to honor ProtagonistB's memory by living ProtagonistA's life to the fullest 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would want that for ProtagonistA 
 And so , ProtagonistA did 
One day in August , a winter in the West , ProtagonistA came to a village to pick up ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistC's head and down at ProtagonistA's feet and said ,  ProtagonistB , go on 
  ProtagonistC had always been a bit of a mystery to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA had always been content to follow ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being led around blindly and wanted to know what was going on 
  Go on ,  ProtagonistA said again 
  ProtagonistA 'll be right behind ProtagonistB 
  And with that , ProtagonistA set off after ProtagonistC , determined to find out what ProtagonistC was up to 
 That 's how ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA the night ProtagonistA rose from ProtagonistA's deepest sleep 
 ProtagonistA was floating above them , ProtagonistA's eyes closed and a serene smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 Then ProtagonistA slowly floated away , disappearing into the night 
ProtagonistA had always loved the stars 
 ProtagonistA loved the way they twinkled and shone , and ProtagonistA loved the way they made ProtagonistA feel small 
 ProtagonistA loved the way they made ProtagonistA feel like anything was possible 
 But lately , ProtagonistA had been feeling different 
 ProtagonistA felt like the stars were too bright , and they made ProtagonistA feel dizzy 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to fall 
 One night , ProtagonistA went out to the beach to look at the stars 
 The sky was blue and black and vast with the stars , but ProtagonistA was pale and yellow and ProtagonistA's light was dim , casting a yellowish tinge over the sea of stars which stands above the earth 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to faint 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to fall into the sky 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to die 
 ProtagonistA felt a hand on ProtagonistA's shoulder , and ProtagonistA felt someone else 's light shining next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt safe 
 ProtagonistA turned to see who it was , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt better then 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could stand up and face the stars again 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could face anything 
ProtagonistA sat up all night , thinking about all the things ProtagonistA had seen 
 ProtagonistA had seen so many amazing things , and ProtagonistA was just getting started 
 ProtagonistA thought about the places ProtagonistA had been , and the people ProtagonistA had met 
 ProtagonistA thought about all the things ProtagonistA had learned , and all the things ProtagonistA still had to learn 
 ProtagonistA thought about the future , and what ProtagonistA wanted to do with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA thought about all the possibilities , and all the things ProtagonistA could do 
 ProtagonistA was excited for the future , and ProtagonistA was ready to take on whatever came ProtagonistA's way 
ProtagonistA had been on the ship for weeks , and ProtagonistA was getting tired of being cooped up 
 ProtagonistA longed to be on land , to feel the sun on ProtagonistA's face and the grass beneath ProtagonistA's feet 
 When the ship stopped at the bridge , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's chance 
 ProtagonistA begged ProtagonistB to take ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB agreed 
 ProtagonistA was overjoyed to be on land again 
 ProtagonistA felt alive and free 
 But within days , ProtagonistA started to feel ill 
 ProtagonistA had no money and no way to get help 
 ProtagonistA tried to make it to the ship , but ProtagonistA was too weak 
 ProtagonistA died of cholera a few miles from the bridge 
 ProtagonistA knocked at the door , and when ProtagonistB opened it , ProtagonistA asked for ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA then asked if ProtagonistB could come in and wait for ProtagonistC 
 After a while , ProtagonistA began to feel sleepy , and ProtagonistA dozed off in ProtagonistA's chair 
ProtagonistA was walking home from ProtagonistA's friend 's house when ProtagonistA dropped ProtagonistA's bag of toys on the ground 
 ProtagonistA looked up and saw a brick - and - mortar window with a two - foot - high gap in it 
 ProtagonistA could see into the room , and it looked like there was a party going on inside 
 ProtagonistA could hear laughter and music coming from the room , and ProtagonistA saw people dancing 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could go to the party , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to leave ProtagonistA's toys outside , so ProtagonistA picked them up and went home 
 ProtagonistA had been the only daughter of parents who loved each other with a love that was strong and true , and ProtagonistA had been their pride and joy 
 ProtagonistA grew up to be a beautiful young woman , with a heart as pure as gold 
 But ProtagonistA was a strong young woman , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could get through anything as long as ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's memories of ProtagonistA's parents to keep ProtagonistA going 
 ProtagonistA did get through those tough times , and ProtagonistA went on to live a happy and fulfilling life 
 ProtagonistA married a good man and had children of ProtagonistA's own 
 And ProtagonistA always remembered ProtagonistA's parents , and the love they had shared , with tenderness and gratitude 
ProtagonistA had been drinking with ProtagonistB all evening , and ProtagonistA had been told to go to bed early , for ProtagonistA was going to spend all night with ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistB went to bed , ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB and snuggled up close to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt a bit lonely , but ProtagonistA was glad to be spending the night with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had been reading aloud to the two children for what felt like hours 
 ProtagonistA was getting tired and ProtagonistA's mind was starting to wander 
 ProtagonistA had gone over the whole story again and felt more than ever that ProtagonistA had gone astray 
 ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA was in the past 
 ProtagonistA decided to take a break and went to get a drink of water 
 When ProtagonistA came back , ProtagonistA saw that the children had fallen asleep 
ProtagonistA was a blonde girl with long black hair , and while ProtagonistA knew it was only a possibility that ProtagonistA would one day be all of thirty - two , it did n't matter 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life and did n't care about the future 
 ProtagonistA was content to live in the present and enjoy each day as it came 
ProtagonistA was of the opinion that ProtagonistA was morally and intellectually superior to ProtagonistA's neighbors and that the best way to enjoy ProtagonistA's advantages was to treat them with the utmost civility and affability 
 ProtagonistA always went out of ProtagonistA's way to be kind and friendly to everyone ProtagonistA met , and ProtagonistA was always quick to offer help or advice whenever anyone needed it 
 As a result , ProtagonistA was very popular and well - liked by everyone in ProtagonistA's community 
ProtagonistA 's coming 
 ProtagonistA 's ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA was coming to visit ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA arrived in town and made ProtagonistA's way to ProtagonistB's house 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB all about ProtagonistA's life since they had last seen each other 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA had to leave 
 ProtagonistA promised to come back soon 
 As ProtagonistB raised the blade , ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes , resigned to ProtagonistA's fate 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being told what to do , so ProtagonistA decided to go into the forest anyway 
 Deep in the forest , ProtagonistA came across a strange creature 
 ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA did n't want to show it 
 ProtagonistA stood up to the creature and said ,  ProtagonistA will not let you hurt ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had stood up to the creature and it had left ProtagonistA alone 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA did n't need ProtagonistB to tell ProtagonistA what to do all the time 
 ProtagonistA could stand up for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was a great speaker 
 ProtagonistA always captivated ProtagonistA's audience with ProtagonistA's stories 
 Today , ProtagonistA was telling a story about ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was fifteen when ProtagonistA walked into the shopper 's window of the stockade at Nightingale 's Gate , and into the room that was always there , and out of the dark , dusty floors 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , ever since ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's home in the forest 
 ProtagonistA was tired and hungry , and ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was going 
 But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving 
 But as ProtagonistA reached for the handle , ProtagonistA heard a voice behind ProtagonistA 
 I'm Alice ,  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's voice shaking 
  ProtagonistA 'm just looking for a way out 
  ProtagonistA ca n't just walk in here and take what ProtagonistA want 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA was scared and ProtagonistA did n't want to get in trouble 
 But ProtagonistA also did n't want to spend the rest of ProtagonistA's life in this tiny room 
 Please ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA wo n't take anything 
 ProtagonistA nodded , and then ProtagonistA was out the door and on ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving 
ProtagonistA was increasing in stature 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful , cat - faced creature , but most people would admit that ProtagonistA was rather strange 
 ProtagonistA always seemed to be looking for something , and ProtagonistA was never satisfied with what ProtagonistA had 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a door 
 ProtagonistA had never seen a door like this before , and ProtagonistA was curious 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and found ProtagonistA in a strange place 
 ProtagonistA picked up the key and looked at it 
 ProtagonistA wondered what it was for 
 ProtagonistA tried to open the door , but it would n't budge 
 ProtagonistA was starting to get scared 
 Then , ProtagonistA heard a voice 
  ProtagonistA , I 've been waiting for ProtagonistA ,  the voice said 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw a cat 
 Who are you ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 Help ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistA said 
  But first , ProtagonistA must solve a riddle 
 A riddle ?  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA do n't know if ProtagonistA 'm good at riddles 
  If ProtagonistA ca n't solve this riddle , ProtagonistA 'll never find what ProtagonistA 're looking for 
 ProtagonistA thought for a moment 
 Then , ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA 'm ready 
 Then , ProtagonistA said ,  A river 
 ProtagonistA took the key and put it in ProtagonistA's pocket 
  And once ProtagonistA find what ProtagonistA 're looking for , ProtagonistA 'll never lose it again 
ProtagonistA's name was Lucy , and ProtagonistA was just seventeen when we first met 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful girl , with long dark hair and blue eyes 
 ProtagonistA would often go out by ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA would be gone for hours at a time 
 ProtagonistA admitted that ProtagonistA had been cheating on me , and ProtagonistA told me that ProtagonistA was in love with the other guy 
 But ProtagonistA was curious , and one day ProtagonistA decided to take the plunge 
 ProtagonistA felt free and alive 
 ProtagonistA swims for hours , until ProtagonistA finally comes across a creature 
ProtagonistA was walking through the great halls of the castle when ProtagonistA came face to face with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with a kindly expression and said ,  ProtagonistA , what are ProtagonistA doing here all alone?Alice told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's story ; how ProtagonistA had been walking in the forest when ProtagonistA got lost and could n't find ProtagonistA's way home 
 ProtagonistA agreed and the two of them spent the day talking and getting to know each other 
 By the end of the day , ProtagonistA was feeling much better and ProtagonistB was happy to have had some company 
 ProtagonistA was very grateful and promised to come back and visit ProtagonistB again soon 
ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's pregnant state , was feeling the weight of the world on ProtagonistA's shoulders 
 ProtagonistA prayed to ProtagonistB , for guidance and wisdom in choosing the right path for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's son 
 ProtagonistA asked that ProtagonistB be given the strength to establish ProtagonistB's religion and to gather ProtagonistB's followers in this city 
ProtagonistA is sitting alone in a hospital bed , across the way from ProtagonistA's home 
 ProtagonistA is waiting for the doctors to come and tell ProtagonistA what is wrong with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA is worried that ProtagonistA might have cancer 
 ProtagonistA has been feeling tired and weak for the past few months 
 ProtagonistA has lost a lot of weight , and ProtagonistA has no appetite 
 ProtagonistA knows that this is not going to be good news 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm sorry to have to tell ProtagonistA this , but ProtagonistA have cancer 
 ProtagonistA breaks down into tears 
 ProtagonistA ca n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA is only thirty years old 
 ProtagonistA has a young daughter at home 
 ProtagonistA does n't want to leave ProtagonistA's daughter alone in this world 
 ProtagonistA is scared , but ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA has to fight 
 ProtagonistA has to fight for ProtagonistA's daughter , for ProtagonistA's family , and for ProtagonistA's own life 
ProtagonistA was a well - built , long - legged , very pretty , pretty girl with a certain childlike air of innocence about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had blue eyes and blond hair which ProtagonistA wore in a long braid down ProtagonistA's back 
 ProtagonistA was always cheerful and happy , even when bad things happened , like when ProtagonistA's parents died in a car accident when ProtagonistA was only eight 
 Even then , ProtagonistA bounced back quickly , living with ProtagonistA's Aunt Tillie and going to school like nothing had happened 
 Now , at eighteen , ProtagonistA was finishing up high school and looking forward to the future 
 ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was pretty sure ProtagonistB was going to ask ProtagonistA to marry ProtagonistB soon 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do without ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA was a strong girl 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would get through this , even if it took some time 
 And eventually , ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA met someone new , a guy named Bob , and they got married 
 And ProtagonistA lived happily ever after 
ProtagonistA considered ProtagonistA the luckiest woman alive 
 ProtagonistA had a wonderful husband , two beautiful children , and a job ProtagonistA loved 
 ProtagonistA knew that life was precious and that ProtagonistA needed to make the most of it 
 ProtagonistA was always looking for ways to help others 
 ProtagonistA volunteered at ProtagonistA's children 's school and at ProtagonistA's church 
 ProtagonistA was always willing to lend a helping hand to anyone in need 
 ProtagonistA was a true blessing to everyone ProtagonistA met 
 ProtagonistA was always positive and upbeat , and ProtagonistA radiated happiness 
 ProtagonistA was truly the luckiest woman alive 
 I've never read it ,  ProtagonistA admitted 
 Finally , ProtagonistA stood up 
 ProtagonistA walked back into the house , feeling refreshed 
 ProtagonistA should do it more often 
ProtagonistA had been in ProtagonistA's cell for two days now 
 ProtagonistA was innocent , but nobody believed ProtagonistA 
 On the second day of ProtagonistA's incarceration , ProtagonistA could n't bear to get up from the bed ProtagonistA had been lying on for hours 
 ProtagonistA stayed in ProtagonistA's room for a few minutes , and then , without saying a word , ProtagonistA took one last deep breath and , as if nothing happened , let ProtagonistA go 
ProtagonistA is a young girl who loves the moon 
 The moon is ProtagonistA's only friend , and ProtagonistA is nothing without it 
 One night , ProtagonistA looks up at the moon and makes a wish 
 ProtagonistA wishes that ProtagonistA could go to the moon and meet ProtagonistA's friend in person 
 The next day , ProtagonistA packs ProtagonistA's bags and heads to the moon 
 ProtagonistA is excited to finally meet ProtagonistA's friend and see the beauty of the moon firsthand 
 When ProtagonistA arrives , ProtagonistA is not disappointed 
ProtagonistA was always fascinated by the ancient art of raising the dead 
 ProtagonistA had read all the books on the subject , and had even tried it a few times , but with no success 
 ProtagonistA travelled to the ancient site where the artwork was said to be located 
 When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA saw a large stone tablet with an inscription on it 
 ProtagonistA was not sure what to do , but ProtagonistA decided to try it anyway 
 ProtagonistA placed ProtagonistA's hand on the tablet and concentrated ProtagonistA's power 
 ProtagonistA was shocked , but ProtagonistA had done it ! ProtagonistA had raised the dead ! 
 ProtagonistA grew up in a chateau in the Loire Valley and finished ProtagonistA's education in a convent in Paris 
 When ProtagonistA was 21 , ProtagonistA married a French count and they had a daughter 
 ProtagonistA moved back to England with ProtagonistA's daughter and started a new life 
 ProtagonistA began working as a governess and then as a teacher 
 ProtagonistA also started writing children 's stories 
 In ProtagonistA's stories , ProtagonistA often wrote about girls who were misunderstood or had difficult lives 
 But ProtagonistA always gave them a happy ending 
 ProtagonistA also became friends with some of the most famous people of ProtagonistA's time , including the writer , Oscar Wilde 
 ProtagonistA was always lonely and felt that ProtagonistA did n't belong anywhere 
 ProtagonistA died in 1932 , at the age of 45 
ProtagonistA had always been a bright girl , but ProtagonistA was never one for school 
 ProtagonistA was content to work at ProtagonistA's mom 's diner and live a simple life 
 ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA was in over ProtagonistA's head 
 And so , ProtagonistA went to college 
 ProtagonistA was nervous at first , but ProtagonistA quickly made friends and excelled in ProtagonistA's classes 
 ProtagonistA even found a boyfriend 
 By the time ProtagonistA graduated , ProtagonistA was confident and successful 
 And ProtagonistA was proud to have proved everyone wrong 
The day after ProtagonistA's engagement as an actress , ProtagonistA had a severe headache , and had to walk at all hours 
 ProtagonistA had been so excited to finally be able to make a career for ProtagonistA , but now ProtagonistA was starting to worry that it was all too much 
 ProtagonistA had never been good at handling stress , and now ProtagonistA was going to have to learn how to deal with it 
 ProtagonistA was also worried about the future 
 ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA was going to be able to handle being in the spotlight all the time 
 ProtagonistA is a figment of our imagination , created by our need for a storybook heroine 
 ProtagonistA is the personification of innocence and curiosity , two qualities which are often lacking in the modern world 
 Even though ProtagonistA is not real , ProtagonistA brings joy to our lives and reminds us of the possibilities that exist beyond our everyday reality 
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA saw a strange light in the distance 
 ProtagonistA walked towards it and saw that it was coming from a lamp on a small platform in the center of the light 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA saw that there was a person sitting on the platform , and they were looking at ProtagonistA with a strange expression 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had seen this person before , but ProtagonistA could n't remember where 
 ProtagonistA walked closer to the platform and sat down 
 ProtagonistA thanked the person and began to look for the door 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where it was , but ProtagonistA was determined to find it 
 ProtagonistA searched for hours , but ProtagonistA could n't find it 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw a door in the distance 
When ProtagonistA was seven and ProtagonistA had nothing to do , ProtagonistA sat down on the floor of ProtagonistA's father 's bedroom and read a book , with a book in the lap of ProtagonistA's hand , holding the pages up against the light , and the light has never been the same again 
 From that day on , ProtagonistA was a different person 
 ProtagonistA was always reading , and ProtagonistA loved it 
  It 's time to wake up , sleepyhead !  ProtagonistA called out to the world 
  There 's so much to do and see today !  ProtagonistA was always full of energy and enthusiasm , and today was no different 
  Come on , everyone !  ProtagonistA called out 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the veranda of the front door with ProtagonistA's hands on the knob , when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the other side of the door 
 ProtagonistA slowly turned the knob and opened the door a crack , to see what was making the noise 
 Peeking through the opening , ProtagonistA saw a small , furry creature scurrying around the floor 
 It was a mouse ! ProtagonistA had always been afraid of mice , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't just leave it there to starve 
 ProtagonistA slowly opened the door wider and reached out ProtagonistA's hand to the mouse 
 Once it was safely in ProtagonistA's hand , ProtagonistA carried it outside and released it into the grass 
 In this manner ProtagonistA would not only be able to continue ProtagonistA's work after death , but also to be of some service to the living 
 ProtagonistA would spend hours watching them , trying to understand their movements and their songs 
 But now , ProtagonistA just felt angry 
 ProtagonistA had always known ProtagonistA was different , but ProtagonistA had never realized how much until now 
 ProtagonistA felt like a caged bird ProtagonistA , and the thought made ProtagonistA even more angry 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice 
 It was soft and gentle , and it seemed to be coming from the page ProtagonistA was looking at 
 ProtagonistA looked up , and saw a flock of birds flying overhead 
 And as ProtagonistA listened , ProtagonistA realized that they were singing to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's anger melting away , and ProtagonistA smiled 
 Maybe ProtagonistA was n't so alone after all 
ProtagonistA sits cross - legged on the floor of the dark alcove , ProtagonistA's fingers tracing the lines of a small painting 
 ProtagonistA feels a sense of peace emanating from the painting , and ProtagonistA ca n't help but feel drawn to it 
 ProtagonistA sits there for a long time , just staring at the painting and letting ProtagonistA's mind wander 
 ProtagonistB was a successful businessman , and ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's only child 
 ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA could ever want , but ProtagonistA was still unhappy 
 ProtagonistA was always getting into trouble at school , and ProtagonistB had to bail ProtagonistA out 
 ProtagonistA was constantly partying and drinking , and ProtagonistB was worried about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't listen 
 ProtagonistA partyied even more and ProtagonistA's grades suffered 
 ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA had made a mistake 
 ProtagonistA tried to get ProtagonistB to take ProtagonistA back , but ProtagonistB refused 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA did n't need ProtagonistB's money to be happy 
ProtagonistA had been with the ship for years , and it had been ProtagonistA's home 
ProtagonistA was on the eve of the most important visit of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was to meet the family of the Earl 's son who was coming to Arrakis from the Province 
 ProtagonistA was very excited and nervous at the same time 
 ProtagonistA wanted everything to be perfect 
 ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's best dress laid out and ProtagonistA's hair done up in an elegant style 
 ProtagonistA was just about to go to bed when ProtagonistA heard a noise outside ProtagonistA's window 
 ProtagonistA got up to investigate and saw a large , black bird perched on ProtagonistA's window sill 
 ProtagonistA quickly went to bed , but ProtagonistA could not shake the feeling that the bird was an omen of something bad to come 
 ProtagonistA was always doing things differently 
 ProtagonistA would walk to school a different way every day , and ProtagonistA would always find new and interesting things to do 
ProtagonistA had been fighting for ProtagonistA's life for what felt like hours 
 ProtagonistB was a skilled swordsman , and ProtagonistA was quickly tiring 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't keep this up much longer 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's opportunity 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's chance and lunged forward , disarming ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA went to move forward and finish ProtagonistB off , but ProtagonistA's foot caught on something and ProtagonistA stumbled 
 ProtagonistA quickly regained ProtagonistA's footing and ran to ProtagonistB , pulling ProtagonistB back from the edge 
 ProtagonistA helped ProtagonistB to ProtagonistB's feet and handed ProtagonistB ProtagonistB's sword 
  But ProtagonistA 're not the only one with tricks up their sleeve 
ProtagonistA had been thinking all night and ProtagonistA 'd been stumped ever since 
 ProtagonistA had been trying to think of a way to tell ProtagonistB , that ProtagonistA liked ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB liked ProtagonistA too , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistB liked ProtagonistA in the same way 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to ruin their friendship if ProtagonistB did n't feel the same way 
 ProtagonistA finally decided that ProtagonistA would just have to tell ProtagonistB and see what happened 
 ProtagonistA gathered ProtagonistA's courage and approached ProtagonistB the next day 
ProtagonistA had driven for an entire day , and a whole day 's sleep , and had done nothing of note save to be driven to the place ProtagonistA was going to be raped 
 ProtagonistA had been planning to stop at a motel for the night , but ProtagonistB had told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA would not be needing a room 
 ProtagonistA had no idea what was going to happen to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA knew it could n't be good 
 ProtagonistA had been planning to fight back , but ProtagonistA was so tired from the drive that ProtagonistA could n't muster the energy 
 ProtagonistA could hear someone else in the room , but ProtagonistA could n't see them 
 Then , ProtagonistA felt a cold , hard object press against ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA knew what was coming next , and ProtagonistA resigned ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's fate 
ProtagonistA had been very wrong in ProtagonistA's belief that I would ever be with anyone , or marry anyone 
 ProtagonistA had seen me with many women over the years , but ProtagonistA always assumed that I was just playing the field and that I would eventually settle down with one woman 
 ProtagonistA was wrong 
 ProtagonistA was happy for me , but ProtagonistA also could n't help but feel a little bit jealous 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to be with me , but ProtagonistA knew that it was never meant to be 
ProtagonistA was sitting at ProtagonistA's typewriter , studying the words typed on the screen 
 ProtagonistA was trying to decide if ProtagonistA should change them or not 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about how ProtagonistA's story was going to end 
 ProtagonistA had a few ideas , but ProtagonistA was n't sure which one to choose 
 ProtagonistA was also thinking about the other stories ProtagonistA had written 
 ProtagonistA was wondering if ProtagonistA should change them too 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about all of this when ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA got up from ProtagonistA's chair and went to the door 
 ProtagonistA looked through the peephole and saw ProtagonistB walking up the stairs 
 ProtagonistA quickly went back to ProtagonistA's typewriter and sat down 
 ProtagonistA was trying to think of a way to get out of the situation 
 ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB coming closer to ProtagonistA's door 
 ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB stop at ProtagonistA's door 
 ProtagonistA held ProtagonistA's breath 
 ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB put the bag down 
 ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB fumbling with something 
 ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB curse 
 ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB walk away 
 ProtagonistA waited a few minutes before ProtagonistA got up 
 ProtagonistA looked out the peephole again 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and looked around 
 ProtagonistA did n't see ProtagonistB or the bag 
 ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistA's typewriter and sat down 
 ProtagonistA was also curious about what was in the bag 
 ProtagonistA decided to go and find out 
ProtagonistA was out for a walk in the park when ProtagonistA came across a bush 
 ProtagonistA had never seen ProtagonistB before , but ProtagonistA was n't sure 
 What 's ProtagonistA's name ?  ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's name , and the two of them talked for a while 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA had to go , but ProtagonistA promised to come back and visit ProtagonistB again 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the shadow of the building , and ProtagonistA's eyes had the kind of serenity of a few hours spent in a convincing dream 
 ProtagonistA felt at peace 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately and needed a moment to just relax and breathe 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let the peace wash over ProtagonistA 
 However , ProtagonistA was never quite sure what to say , and ProtagonistA would often end up rambling on about something that nobody else cared about 
ProtagonistA has always considered ProtagonistA a strong and independent woman 
 Yes , ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB deeply and they had a great relationship , but ProtagonistA also felt like ProtagonistA now had a responsibility to ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA did n't have before 
 ProtagonistA became more aware of ProtagonistA's need to take care of ProtagonistB and make sure that ProtagonistB was happy and healthy 
 In some ways , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was losing ProtagonistA's independence by being married 
 But , at the same time , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was gaining something much more valuable : a true partner in life who loved and supported ProtagonistA unconditionally 
ProtagonistA has never been to the movies before , but ProtagonistA 's always been involved in them 
 As a child , ProtagonistA would often act out scenes from ProtagonistA's favorite films with ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA would always be the one to direct and produce these little productions 
 Even though ProtagonistA 's never actually been to a movie theater , ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA knows them quite well 
 One day , ProtagonistA decides to finally take the plunge and go to the movies 
 ProtagonistA 's not quite sure what to expect , but ProtagonistA 's excited nonetheless 
 ProtagonistA chooses a film that ProtagonistA 's been wanting to see for a long time and settles into ProtagonistA's seat 
 ProtagonistA ca n't believe that ProtagonistA 's finally experienced something that ProtagonistA 's always been so interested in 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA 'll be back for more 
 ProtagonistA was a very special girl 
 ProtagonistA had a very special gift 
 ProtagonistA could talk to animals 
 ProtagonistA could understand what they were saying and ProtagonistA could help them 
 ProtagonistA helped them when they were sick and when they were in danger 
 ProtagonistA was a true friend to them 
ProtagonistA was sailing on the Lusitania to San Diego , California to meet with the rich and famous 
 ProtagonistA was very excited to meet them and have a private audience 
 During ProtagonistA's voyage , ProtagonistA enjoyed the beautiful scenery and the luxurious accommodations on the ship 
 ProtagonistA was very pleased to meet them and have a wonderful time 
ProtagonistA ran with alacrity through several miles of fields , forests , and meadows , bearing with ProtagonistA the great stuff of life : the apple , the bramble , the cherry - tree , the thorn - trees , and so many trees , some two hundred yards in circumference 
 ProtagonistA had been running for hours , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and ProtagonistA's breath was coming in ragged gasps 
 But ProtagonistA did n't stop , ProtagonistA could n't stop 
 ProtagonistA had to keep going , ProtagonistA had to find the others 
 ProtagonistA had been running for days 
 ProtagonistA had no food , no water , and no idea where ProtagonistA was going 
 But ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 ProtagonistA had to find the others 
 ProtagonistA finally came to a clearing in the forest and saw a small cabin in the distance 
 ProtagonistA pounded on the door of the cabin , but there was no answer 
 ProtagonistA tried the handle , but it was locked 
 ProtagonistA collapsed to the ground , defeated 
 ProtagonistA was so tired , so thirsty , and so hungry 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how much longer ProtagonistA could go on 
 ProtagonistA 're safe now 
 ProtagonistA was too weak to resist 
 ProtagonistA allowed ProtagonistB to help ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's feet and lead ProtagonistA into the cabin 
 Inside , ProtagonistA found the others 
 ProtagonistA collapsed into the arms of ProtagonistA's friends , relief washing over ProtagonistA 
Once upon a time , in a deep , dark corner of the universe , there was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was a very old , very fat king 
 ProtagonistA ruled over ProtagonistA's kingdom with an iron fist , and anyone who dared cross ProtagonistA was swiftly dealt with 
ProtagonistA was well past the age of twenty when ProtagonistA found the way to hell 
 ProtagonistA had always been a curious girl , and ProtagonistA was always looking for new adventures 
 ProtagonistA had to see it for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA found the way to hell easily enough 
 But ProtagonistA was also curious , and ProtagonistA wanted to see what this place was all about 
 ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA in the presence of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was a fearsome creature , and ProtagonistA was terrified of ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA was also curious , and ProtagonistA wanted to know more about ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA was also curious , and ProtagonistA wanted to know more 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA became tired of ProtagonistB's world , and ProtagonistA wanted to leave 
 ProtagonistA was horrified , and ProtagonistA regretted ever coming to this place 
ProtagonistA was in a large room on the first floor 
 ProtagonistA was there because ProtagonistA's father had planned to put ProtagonistA in the interests of peace 
 ProtagonistA decided not to leave because ProtagonistA did n't want to cause any trouble 
ProtagonistA was two years into ProtagonistA's career as a journalist when ProtagonistA was unexpectedly given the ultimatum of going it alone 
 ProtagonistA was to expose the real source of the calamity ProtagonistA was involved in 
 ProtagonistA had been investigating a story for months , and ProtagonistA was finally close to uncovering the truth 
 ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do it 
 ProtagonistA went to the place where the calamity had occurred and spoke to the people who were there 
 ProtagonistA quickly realized that the real source of the problem was not what ProtagonistA had originally thought 
 ProtagonistA exposed the truth and the story made headlines 
ProtagonistA has been working in the fields of London for a very long time , and of all the police officers here , to which ProtagonistA belongs , none , neither male nor female , is a match for anybody else 
 ProtagonistA ca n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but ProtagonistA feels like something 's not right 
 But ProtagonistA knows better 
 ProtagonistA knows that something is wrong , and ProtagonistA 's determined to find out what it is 
 ProtagonistA starts doing some digging , and ProtagonistA quickly discovers that there 's a new drug on the streets of London 
 ProtagonistA starts tracking down the dealers who are selling the stuff , and ProtagonistA finally manages to put an end to it 
 But ProtagonistA ca n't help but feel a little uneasy 
 ProtagonistA 's sure that there 's something else out there , something even more dangerous 
 And ProtagonistA 's determined to find it 
ProtagonistA was always a tall girl , even when ProtagonistA was just six years old 
 ProtagonistA towers over ProtagonistA's classmates and everyone always comments on how pretty ProtagonistA is 
 But ProtagonistA never really felt like ProtagonistA fit in 
 ProtagonistA was always the tallest , the prettiest , and the smartest girl in ProtagonistA's class , but ProtagonistA never felt like ProtagonistA belonged 
 One day , ProtagonistA ran into ProtagonistB 
 Now , whenever ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA does n't belong , ProtagonistA thinks of ProtagonistB and knows that ProtagonistA 's not alone 
ProtagonistA was walking through town on the left hand side of the road when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB's story was 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB was beautiful and that ProtagonistB deserved to be loved 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to go on without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so lost and confused 
 One day , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's grave and ProtagonistA just sat there and cried 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had no one to turn to 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt a hand on ProtagonistA's shoulder and ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistB standing there 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe that ProtagonistA had just seen ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistB had given ProtagonistA the strength to go on 
 Even though ProtagonistB was gone , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would always be with ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was beyond exhausted 
 ProtagonistA had been on the run from the zombies ever since the outbreak had begun 
 ProtagonistA had seen too many people ProtagonistA loved die - first ProtagonistA's parents , then ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA was all alone now , and ProtagonistA was running out of hope 
 ProtagonistA had been sleeping in abandoned buildings and cars when ProtagonistA could , but it was never safe for long 
 ProtagonistA was always on the move , always looking for a place to hide 
 ProtagonistA had fought them off as best ProtagonistA could , but in the end , they had overpowered ProtagonistA 
 And now , here ProtagonistA was , in an old , abandoned cell 
 ProtagonistA lay down on the cold , hard floor , and ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes 
 Sleeping is a bitch ,  ProtagonistA said to ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA prepared to die 
And then there was ProtagonistA , and it was as if ProtagonistA had been born with a soul , and it was as if ProtagonistA had been born to be a dead man , and it was as though ProtagonistA had been born in the middle of the desert , and it was as though ProtagonistA had been born in the dead of winter , and it was as though ProtagonistA had been born in a small town , and as though ProtagonistA had been born in a small , crowded town , and it had been only twelve here , and there was a full moon , and it had been fenced off and a total of sixty - four people , and no one knew , and nobody was quite sure what the password was , and it did not make any difference , because nobody had ever had the misfortune of knowing what the password was , and nobody had ever going to be a million times as smart as ProtagonistA was , and nobody was n't quite sure how they got into the place , and nobody was quite sure how they started , and nobody had ever known , and nobody had ever really known , and theory was as cold as theory , and theory was what had , as far as anybody was concerned , taken the place of practice ; and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and 
ProtagonistA was sitting at the table with ProtagonistA's family on the first day of the summer solstice 
ProtagonistA had been walking ProtagonistB , every day for years 
 Even in ProtagonistA's seventies , ProtagonistA was still able to take ProtagonistB for a walk around the block 
 One day , as they were walking , ProtagonistA saw a cat in a tree 
 ProtagonistA had never seen that cat before 
 ProtagonistA stopped to look at it 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to leave the cat there , but ProtagonistA did n't want to leave ProtagonistB alone either 
 Finally , ProtagonistA made a decision 
 ProtagonistA would go get help 
 ProtagonistA would find someone to help ProtagonistA get the cat down from the tree 
 ProtagonistA walked home , ProtagonistB by ProtagonistA's side 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had made the right decision 
ProtagonistA was a woman who lived a simple life 
 ProtagonistA worked hard at ProtagonistA's job and came home to relax in ProtagonistA's small apartment 
The night before ProtagonistA drowned , ProtagonistA had a dream , as it were 
 In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA standing at the edge of a vast and dark ocean 
 ProtagonistA could not see the shoreline in either direction , and the only sound was the crashing of the waves 
 In the dream , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to drown , and ProtagonistA felt a deep sense of terror 
 But even as ProtagonistA felt the fear , ProtagonistA also felt a sense of peace and acceptance 
 In the dream , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA diving into the water and sinking down into the darkness 
 ProtagonistA could feel the water closing in around ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to die 
 But even as ProtagonistA felt the fear , ProtagonistA also felt a sense of peace and acceptance 
ProtagonistA had not changed one bit since the day ProtagonistA had to flee ProtagonistA's homeland 
 ProtagonistA was still the same strong , independent woman ProtagonistA had always been 
 ProtagonistA had never been one to rely on others , and ProtagonistA was determined to make it on ProtagonistA's own 
 When ProtagonistA arrived in the United States , ProtagonistA had nothing but the clothes on ProtagonistA's back and the determination to succeed 
 ProtagonistA started out working odd jobs , but eventually ProtagonistA was able to get a job in a factory 
 ProtagonistA worked hard and saved ProtagonistA's money , and eventually ProtagonistA was able to buy ProtagonistA's own home 
 ProtagonistA was proud of ProtagonistA's accomplishments , and ProtagonistA was determined to help others who were in ProtagonistA's situation 
 ProtagonistA became a mentor to other refugees , and ProtagonistA helped them adjust to their new lives 
 ProtagonistA was a symbol of hope for many people , and ProtagonistA was proud to be able to help others 
ProtagonistA called she by ProtagonistA's surname , and we have been called by it ever since 
 It was a cold winter morning and ProtagonistA had just awoken from a long sleep 
 ProtagonistA slowly got out of bed , feeling a bit disoriented 
 As ProtagonistA began to make ProtagonistA's way downstairs , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name 
  ProtagonistA , breakfast is ready !  However , when ProtagonistA got to the kitchen , ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistA's mother was not there 
 Instead , ProtagonistA saw a large rabbit sitting at the table 
  Follow me !  ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA decided to follow the rabbit 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like this before , and ProtagonistA was curious to see where the rabbit would lead ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA walked through the door and found ProtagonistA in a very strange place 
 Then ProtagonistA saw the talking flowers 
 ProtagonistA even saw a butterfly with a human face 
 ProtagonistA was so surprised by all of this that ProtagonistA forgot to be scared 
  ProtagonistA can stay here for a while if ProtagonistA like 
  ProtagonistA was so grateful to the rabbit that ProtagonistA decided to stay 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like this place before , and ProtagonistA wanted to explore it more 
ProtagonistA had been living in ProtagonistA's house for years , and it was going well enough 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided enough was enough 
 ProtagonistA was going to move out of ProtagonistA's house and into a new one , and ProtagonistA was going to do it without the Living knowing 
 ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things in the middle of the night and left ProtagonistA's house quietly 
 ProtagonistA drove to ProtagonistA's new house , and when ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA saw that the Living were there , waiting for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was furious 
 ProtagonistA had outsmarted them this time , but ProtagonistA knew they would be back 
 ProtagonistA had to find a way to get rid of them for good 
ProtagonistA descended the aisle of the château of the Riveuilles ; an imposing house of splendour and distinction , from which ProtagonistA received the name of Richelieu , or Richelodio , or , perhaps , of Lord Bertram 
 As ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way down the aisle , ProtagonistA could feel the weight of the name bearing down on ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA held ProtagonistA's head high and continued on 
 ProtagonistA had always been a headstrong girl 
 ProtagonistA was never one to follow the rules or do what was expected of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA much preferred to forge ProtagonistA's own path 
 ProtagonistA had heard rumours of the wild parties that took place there and ProtagonistA was determined to see for ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA descended the aisle , ProtagonistA could feel the eyes of the guests on ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA was there to have fun and that was all that mattered 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA belonged there 
 As the night went on , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA drawn to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't want the night to end 
 ProtagonistA did n't know ProtagonistB's name , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB 
 As ProtagonistA walked back up the aisle , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was floating on air 
 ProtagonistA had found what ProtagonistA was looking for at the château of the Riveuilles 
 ProtagonistA had found a place where ProtagonistA could be ProtagonistA and have fun 
 And ProtagonistA would never forget the night ProtagonistA spent there 
ProtagonistA was unaccustomed to the sight of ProtagonistA's brother 's statue with ProtagonistA's father atop the Westminster tower 
 ProtagonistA felt dismayed and intellectually disgraced at what ProtagonistA saw 
 However , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to face the music and deal with the situation 
ProtagonistA woke early , and ProtagonistA woke often , as if ProtagonistA had been awake forever , until it was too late 
 ProtagonistA had wanted to get an early start on the day , but now it was already half over 
  ProtagonistA should have been up hours ago 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was right , but ProtagonistA did n't want to admit it 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'll do better tomorrow 
 ProtagonistA went outside , but ProtagonistA did n't feel like playing 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had wasted the day , and ProtagonistA was angry at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA sat down on the porch and watched the birds in the trees , but ProtagonistA did n't feel any better 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA went back inside and up to ProtagonistA's room 
 ProtagonistA lay down on ProtagonistA's bed and stared at the ceiling , wondering what ProtagonistA was going to do with the rest of ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA has finished ProtagonistA's work and is ready to go now 
 ProtagonistA hears the voice even now , telling ProtagonistA to hurry up 
 ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA ca n't keep the voice waiting any longer 
 ProtagonistA has to go now 
ProtagonistA had chosen the kingdom of ProtagonistB out of all creation ; and the power of ProtagonistC had shone forth in every way , to please ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had walked with the angels , and they had showed ProtagonistA the wonders of ProtagonistB 
The night before ProtagonistA drowned , ProtagonistA dreamt that ProtagonistA was walking along a path by a river 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should turn back , but ProtagonistA felt compelled to keep walking 
 ProtagonistA struggled to swim to the surface , but the current was too strong 
 ProtagonistA could see the shore getting further and further away as ProtagonistA was pulled downstream 
 ProtagonistA sank beneath the surface and drowned 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get out of the house before it was too late 
ProtagonistA walked the streets of Croydon , and felt as if ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's heart in ProtagonistA's hands 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had received the news that ProtagonistA's boyfriend had been cheating on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had nowhere to go and no one to turn to 
 As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA passed by a group of girls ProtagonistA's own age 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but feel envious of them 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could be carefree like them , but ProtagonistA just could n't 
 ProtagonistA felt as if ProtagonistA's heart had been shattered into a million pieces , and ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA would ever be able to put it back together again 
ProtagonistA , with Sarah , the little princess , at ProtagonistA's side , rode out into the great wide plain of Phlegethon , where ProtagonistA found the rest of ProtagonistA's family in the company of Mrs
ProtagonistA stood on the horizon of the world , a proud and proud man , but one who knew ProtagonistA had nothing to fear but might actually have some advantage over a very large and very dangerous enemy 
 ProtagonistA had been planning and preparing for this day for years , and now , finally , ProtagonistA was ready 
 ProtagonistA was going to win this fight , and ProtagonistA was going to make ProtagonistA's enemies pay 
 When ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA's purpose was , ProtagonistA simply replied that ProtagonistA was there to protect the city 
 ProtagonistA said that a great danger was coming and that ProtagonistA would do everything in ProtagonistA's power to stop it 
 ProtagonistA stammered when ProtagonistA told the story , but everyone knew ProtagonistA was telling the truth 
 ProtagonistA had seen it with ProtagonistA's own eyes 
 ProtagonistA was the only one who saw what happened that fateful night 
There was once ProtagonistA ; but ProtagonistA was also a man who enjoyed the art of murdering 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful woman , with long dark hair and piercing blue eyes 
 But ProtagonistA was also a cold - blooded killer , who took pleasure in torturing and murdering ProtagonistA's victims 
 ProtagonistA enjoyed hearing them scream in pain , and seeing the terror in their eyes 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's chamber at Lambeth , when ProtagonistA received an urgent and threatening communication 
 ProtagonistA took the message very seriously and immediately began to make preparations to leave 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would not be safe if ProtagonistA stayed at Lambeth , and so ProtagonistA set out into the stormy night 
 ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to get away from the Bishop 's servant 
 ProtagonistA walked through the stormy night , until ProtagonistA came to a small cottage 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door and was welcomed inside by the kindly old woman who lived there 
 ProtagonistA stayed with the old woman for the rest of the night , and in the morning , ProtagonistA set out again on ProtagonistA's journey 
 ProtagonistA never looked back , and ProtagonistA never forgot the stormy night when ProtagonistA had to flee from the Bishop 's servant 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot during the war 
 ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's husband and ProtagonistA's son , and ProtagonistA had been forced to flee ProtagonistA's home 
 But ProtagonistA was a strong woman , and ProtagonistA had managed to make it through 
 ProtagonistA got a job at the local grocery store , and I started school 
 But then , ProtagonistA started to get sick 
 I was heartbroken , but I knew that ProtagonistA was at peace 
 ProtagonistA had given everything ProtagonistA had to make our lives better , and I would never forget ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's chair on the left , reading a letter ; but the letter was full of facts that were interesting to ProtagonistA , such as , ProtagonistA's uncle was a man of coarse manners , and , in consequence of the poverty of his household , very few persons in its neighbourhood were wealthy , and in whom ProtagonistA had any feeling of sympathy 
ProtagonistA sat in the sun and ProtagonistA's mind busy 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how ProtagonistA got to where ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's career and how ProtagonistA had worked hard to get where ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's future and what ProtagonistA wanted to do with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about all of these things when ProtagonistA heard a voice 
  ProtagonistA 'm fine ,  ProtagonistA replied 
  ProtagonistA was just thinking about ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was with ProtagonistA's boyfriend at the time , and they were both really enjoying themselves 
 Since then , ProtagonistA has been celibate , and ProtagonistA does n't regret it one bit 
 ProtagonistA knows that all men , of whatever sex , must die , but ProtagonistA 's happy to have those memories of ProtagonistA's last time with ProtagonistA's boyfriend 
ProtagonistA was the most famous and adored character in the world 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful young woman with a heart of gold 
 ProtagonistA was always helping others and ProtagonistA was loved by everyone 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking home from work when ProtagonistA was attacked by a man who stabbed ProtagonistA to death 
ProtagonistA was a young woman from a small town who had always dreamed of visiting the nation 's capital 
 One day , ProtagonistA finally made the trip and was determined to see as much as ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA started with a tour of the Capitol building and was amazed by the size and grandeur of the place 
 However , ProtagonistA quickly became disappointed when ProtagonistA saw the condition of the grounds 
 ProtagonistA was so appalled by the state of the Capitol that ProtagonistA refused to leave until ProtagonistA had spoken to someone in charge 
 ProtagonistA demanded to know why the grounds were in such a state of disrepair and was told that the budget for maintenance had been cut 
 ProtagonistA was furious 
 ProtagonistA felt that it was a disgrace to the country that the Capitol was not being properly cared for 
 ProtagonistA vowed to write to ProtagonistA's congressman and demand that more money be allocated for the upkeep of the Capitol 
 ProtagonistA was a smart woman and ProtagonistA knew that these men were in a position to help ProtagonistA's business 
 ProtagonistA allowed them to talk , all the while thinking of ways to improve ProtagonistA's own business 
 After a while , ProtagonistA interrupted them and stated ProtagonistA's own opinion on the matter 
 ProtagonistA was able to help ProtagonistA's favourite ladies in their own businesses , and the city continued to improve 
ProtagonistA stopped dead in ProtagonistA's tracks 
 ProtagonistA tried to find the source of the sound , but it just was n't there 
 ProtagonistA looked around , but there was nothing 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA heard it again 
 This time , ProtagonistA followed the sound until ProtagonistA found its source 
 ProtagonistA felt sorry for the cat and decided to take it home 
ProtagonistA was walking after dark when ProtagonistA saw a light in the distance 
 ProtagonistA walked towards it and never stopped 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA saw that the light was coming from a lamp on a porch 
 ProtagonistA walked up to the porch and saw ProtagonistB sitting in a rocking chair 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was n't lost , ProtagonistA was just walking 
 ProtagonistA sat in the rocking chair and they talked 
ProtagonistA managed to keep ProtagonistA's head and face up , to enjoy the moment 
 ProtagonistA had worked hard to be the best and ProtagonistA was going to enjoy ProtagonistA's moment of triumph 
ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way to the grocery store when ProtagonistA saw a group of men sitting on the side of the road 
 ProtagonistA wondered if they had any leisure time to think about what they would do with the other men who were sitting around them 
 ProtagonistA had not seen many men on the road lately and thought it would be a good opportunity to get to know them 
 ProtagonistA walked over to the group and introduced ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was very interested in their stories and enjoyed hearing about their lives 
 ProtagonistA was also very impressed with their knowledge of the world and their ability to have deep conversations 
 When ProtagonistA left , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had made some new friends and was looking forward to meeting them again 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a dreamer 
 ProtagonistA loved to imagine what it would be like to have the life ProtagonistA always wanted 
 ProtagonistA would often daydream about what it would be like to be rich and famous , or to travel the world 
 And then ProtagonistA drank to the full 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's dreams , ProtagonistA's hopes , and ProtagonistA's fears 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the great dream , the thing ProtagonistA should never have taken the risk of doing 
 With ProtagonistB's help , ProtagonistA was able to make ProtagonistA's dream a reality 
 ProtagonistA was finally able to live the life ProtagonistA had always wanted 
ProtagonistA was out for a walk near the frozen lake when ProtagonistA heard a loud cracking noise 
 ProtagonistA turned around to see the ice cracking open and a large hand reaching out towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA tried to run , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistA could feel the icy cold water dragging ProtagonistA down , and the hand pulling at ProtagonistA's hair 
 ProtagonistA struggled to free ProtagonistA , but it was no use 
 ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistA losing consciousness and then everything went black 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who lived in a small town 
 ProtagonistA was always curious about the world and loved to explore 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole that led ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had many adventures in ProtagonistB and made many new friends 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who had a fear of abandonment 
 ProtagonistA had seen everything in the world , and ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistA knew what was best for ProtagonistA 
 However , ProtagonistA was always afraid that someone would leave ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had a love for the world , and ProtagonistA wanted to be a part of it , but ProtagonistA was always afraid that ProtagonistA would be left behind 
 ProtagonistA had always been interested in the world around ProtagonistA , and this was no exception 
 ProtagonistA was eager to learn more about what was happening in the world , and this was the perfect opportunity 
 ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was a man who had lived a full and interesting life , and ProtagonistA was eager to learn from ProtagonistB 
 For the next few months , ProtagonistA spent every day with ProtagonistB , learning everything ProtagonistB could teach ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA quickly became a skilled writer ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA even began to help ProtagonistB with ProtagonistB's work 
ProtagonistA had been online shopping for a new television for the past hour and a half 
 ProtagonistA had finally found the perfect one on Wal - Mart 's website 
 ProtagonistA decided to chat with ProtagonistB to see if ProtagonistB could do anything about the shipping 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and asked ProtagonistB one more time if there was anything ProtagonistB could do about the shipping 
 ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA almost forgot to thank ProtagonistA's grandmother for the advice 
For years , ProtagonistA searched for the city , but ProtagonistA could never find it 
 ProtagonistA would find clues here and there , but they never led ProtagonistA to the right place 
 ProtagonistA was beginning to lose hope 
But then , one day , ProtagonistA finally found it 
 ProtagonistA was finally able to put an end to the chaos that had consumed the earth , and ProtagonistA was able to bring peace to the world once again 
 ProtagonistA was always getting into something , and as the oldest child , it was my job to try and stop ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was always up to something , and ProtagonistA always seemed to find a way to get into trouble 
ProtagonistA rose early that morning , lifting ProtagonistA's ten - pound hammer from the table before she and pounding the ground 
 ProtagonistA had a lot of work to do today 
 ProtagonistA had been a farmer for as long as ProtagonistA could remember 
 ProtagonistA loved the land and the animals , but most of all , ProtagonistA loved the satisfaction of a job well done 
 Today , ProtagonistA was going to build a new chicken coop 
 ProtagonistA worked all morning , stopping only for a quick drink of water from the well 
 ProtagonistA stood back and admired ProtagonistA's work , feeling proud of what ProtagonistA had accomplished 
ProtagonistA was happy when I first met ProtagonistA 
 The first thing I ever thought of ProtagonistA was that ProtagonistA was a holy man , and a good man 
 ProtagonistA was always so kind and gentle , and ProtagonistA always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA was always there for me when I needed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was my best friend , and I could tell ProtagonistA anything 
ProtagonistA was once a highly respected merchant 
 ProtagonistA had a profound knowledge of everything of which ProtagonistA was concerned , of the fine arts of navigation , of the principles of shipbuilding and including the use of explosives , and of the operation of machinery , of all which ProtagonistA's extensive labour did not oblige ProtagonistA to mention 
ProtagonistA was the god of the seas , and ProtagonistB had a hard time determining ProtagonistB's true identity 
 ProtagonistA was the only thing that was real to ProtagonistB anymore 
 ProtagonistA was the only thing that mattered 
ProtagonistA was walking home from ProtagonistA's job at the grocery store when ProtagonistA was accosted by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA did n't have the money 
 ProtagonistA reluctantly agreed to pay ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was given a week to come up with the money 
 ProtagonistA was frantic 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to come up with that kind of money 
 ProtagonistA thought about borrowing it from ProtagonistA's friends or family , but ProtagonistA did n't want to ask them for money 
 ProtagonistA was ashamed and embarrassed 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do 
 Finally , ProtagonistA came up with a plan 
 ProtagonistA would work extra shifts at ProtagonistA's job and save up the money 
 ProtagonistA would not give in to the demands of ProtagonistB 
It was an afternoon of some utility ; it was the middle of January , 1863 , and ProtagonistA was working ProtagonistA's way through an appendix to the first edition of The Origin of Species , which ProtagonistA was carrying with ProtagonistA on ProtagonistA's arm at all times , though ProtagonistA was at times so much employed as to be at rest 
 ProtagonistA had been reading and re - reading it for weeks , and though ProtagonistA found it dry in parts , overall it was an excellent work 
 ProtagonistA was particularly interested in the section on natural selection , and was currently trying to wrap ProtagonistA's head around the concept of sexual selection 
 ProtagonistA quickly stood up and ran to the window , peeking out just in time to see a large group of men on horseback , dressed in Union blue , riding down the street 
 ProtagonistA could hear the men shouting to each other as they rode past , and the sound of gunfire grew more distant 
 This was the reality of war , ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA , and it was something that Charles Darwin had never mentioned in his book 
ProtagonistA was a force to be reckoned with 
 ProtagonistA danced through the streets of New York in a red hot mess of a car and a packed black crowd of people , mostly women and children 
 ProtagonistA was a sight to behold and everyone stopped to watch ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was fearless and alive and ProtagonistA radiated happiness 
ProtagonistA was a dull boy , but not to the point of being a loner , except in the locality where ProtagonistA had an uncle , an aunt , and a cousin ; and as ProtagonistA was such a person , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA quite agreeable to everybody , even to the great majority of ProtagonistA's elders 
 However , one day , while out walking , ProtagonistA came across a large , dark rabbit , who seemed to be looking for something 
 ProtagonistA was so amazed by the sight that ProtagonistA forgot all about ProtagonistA's dull life 
 ProtagonistA stayed in the garden for hours , playing games and picking flowers 
 When ProtagonistA finally left , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never be bored again 
One morning , after the close of our first term , when the pain on my hand was beginning to subside , ProtagonistA issued a paper which ProtagonistA supposed to be a communication from his Majesty , for it bore the stamp of his Majesty 's office , and was filled with the seal of the State 
ProtagonistA had just received the news that ProtagonistA's long - awaited promotion had finally come through 
 But as ProtagonistA thought about it , ProtagonistA realized that the new position would mean more responsibility and less free time 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA should be happy or sad about the news 
 In the end , ProtagonistA decided to be happy and rejoice in ProtagonistA's good fortune 
ProtagonistA was just a boy when ProtagonistA had a dream 
 A world where ProtagonistA could be a princess , or a queen , or even a dragon ! ProtagonistA could fly , or swim , or run as fast as the wind 
 ProtagonistA could do anything ProtagonistA wanted , and no one could stop ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA puts ProtagonistA's hand on the glass and slowly , with a gentle pressure , leans it to the side 
 ProtagonistA looks at the window , wondering if anyone is watching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA sees the reflection of the room behind ProtagonistA and the people in it , but ProtagonistA does not see ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA presses her hand against the glass harder , trying to see if ProtagonistA can make her hand disappear 
 But no matter how hard ProtagonistA presses , ProtagonistA can still see her hand 
 ProtagonistA sighs and leans ProtagonistA's head against the glass 
ProtagonistA was waiting for ProtagonistB , just as ProtagonistA usually was 
 ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistA's watch and sighed 
 ProtagonistA was just about to leave when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB running towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had only been living in the small town for a few months , but ProtagonistA quickly learned that people here liked to gossip 
 ProtagonistA tried to ignore it , but it was hard when everyone seemed to be talking about ProtagonistA behind ProtagonistA back 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to confront ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB why ProtagonistB was always talking about ProtagonistA 
 From then on , ProtagonistA started to feel more comfortable in ProtagonistA's new town and realized that the gossip was n't so bad after all 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA knew the way to heaven but in fact ProtagonistA knew nothing at all 
 ProtagonistA had always been a good person , never doing anything wrong and always helping others 
 But when ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a dark place with no idea how to get out 
 ProtagonistA called out for help but no one came 
 ProtagonistA wandered around for what felt like hours , until ProtagonistA finally came to a door 
 ProtagonistA opened it and found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB in the distance and started to walk towards ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA kept walking and walking but ProtagonistA never got any closer 
 Eventually ProtagonistA gave up and sat down , exhausted 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
ProtagonistA was walking through the park when ProtagonistA overheard two women whispering 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but overhear their conversation as they mentioned ProtagonistA's name and nationality 
 ProtagonistA felt a bit embarrassed but also curious as to why they were talking about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA continued walking and eventually lost sight of the women 
 ProtagonistA shrugged it off and continued on with ProtagonistA's day 
There was ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was old and ProtagonistA looked very old 
 ProtagonistA had wrinkles on ProtagonistA's face and ProtagonistA's hair was gray 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a dress that was too big for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was sitting in a chair in the corner of the room 
 ProtagonistA was very tired and ProtagonistA wanted to go to sleep 
ProtagonistA was taking a walk one day when ProtagonistA suddenly realized that ProtagonistA had been born 
 ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA started to run and did n't stop until ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's house 
 ProtagonistA went inside and told ProtagonistA's family the good news 
ProtagonistA comes at night , the terror of ProtagonistA's lips , limber and voice , stronger than the deathbringer that lay before ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's teeth are black from blood 
 ProtagonistA had come to take what was rightfully ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA would not be denied 
 ProtagonistA was going to take its life , and ProtagonistA would enjoy every moment of it 
The first time I met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was lying on a hospital table in the middle of London 
 ProtagonistA was so pale that I thought ProtagonistA was dead 
 But then ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes and looked at me 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's study in the Court of the Tuileries , looking at an old and heavy book which was lying upon a table 
 ProtagonistA had been reading it for hours , and was so absorbed in it that ProtagonistA did not hear the door open 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing beside ProtagonistA , and knew that ProtagonistA's time had come 
 ProtagonistA was not afraid , but merely curious 
 What is it like , Death ?  ProtagonistA asked 
ProtagonistA , kept up for the last two years of the reign of Suddistharma , a fine , fine trade and business , in which the prosperity of the kingdom depended greatly , from a view of employment to the general good , and from a view of revenue to the interest of a great many millions of pounds , which ProtagonistA called a royal prerogative , and which ProtagonistA possessed by extraction , or some other means which I may not venture to mention here , although , in truth , it was of considerable consequence to ProtagonistA's current business 
ProtagonistA stood up from the log ProtagonistA 'd been sitting on and peered out from the dark cover of ProtagonistA's tea cup 
 ProtagonistA felt a sudden urge to be out in the open , to feel the sun on ProtagonistA's face and the wind in ProtagonistA's hair 
 ProtagonistA set off at a run , leaving the log and ProtagonistA's tea cup behind 
One day , soon after ProtagonistA had become a full - grown man , Mr
 ProtagonistA was very impressed by all that ProtagonistA heard and asked Mr
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was very glad that ProtagonistA had met ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA lived a very long life , but ProtagonistA was always suspicious of people 
 ProtagonistA never really trusted anyone , except in the most extreme circumstances 
 When ProtagonistA was suffering , ProtagonistA would allow others to help ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA always remained guarded 
 Even when ProtagonistA was old and frail , ProtagonistA still did n't let anyone get too close 
 ProtagonistA was a strong and independent woman , and ProtagonistA liked it that way 
ProtagonistA was a woman who loved to travel 
 ProtagonistA was always adding new places to ProtagonistA's list of places ProtagonistA had visited 
 ProtagonistA was always telling ProtagonistA's friends about all the wonderful places ProtagonistA had been 
 One day , ProtagonistA added ,  ProtagonistA never left England , thank heaven , to the list of places ProtagonistA visited 
 ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's country and did n't want to leave it 
 ProtagonistA was happy to travel within England and see all the wonderful places it had to offer 
ProtagonistA had been dreaming of snow since ProtagonistA had been a boy 
 ProtagonistA loved the way it looked in the movies , how it blanketed the ground in a soft , white layer 
 ProtagonistA imagined what it would be like to stand in the middle of a snowstorm , the flakes falling all around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was outside in ProtagonistA's backyard when it started to snow 
 At first , ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA stood there for a moment , just staring at the flakes falling from the sky 
 Then ProtagonistA started to laugh 
 ProtagonistA could n't help it 
 ProtagonistA was just so happy 
 ProtagonistA started to make a snowman , but ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA could n't concentrate 
 ProtagonistA kept running around , trying to catch snowflakes on ProtagonistA's tongue 
 ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should go inside , but ProtagonistA did n't want the fun to end 
 ProtagonistA wanted to stay in this magical world forever 
 But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would always remember the time when ProtagonistA's dream came true and ProtagonistA got to play in the snow 
ProtagonistA must have gone insane , for ProtagonistA could n't keep ProtagonistA's hands to the wheel 
 ProtagonistA was driving down the highway at top speed , weaving in and out of traffic , and laughing maniacally 
 But ProtagonistA was beyond reason 
 ProtagonistA was in a frenzy , and nothing was going to stop ProtagonistA 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA lost control of the car , and it careened off the road , crashing into a tree 
 ProtagonistA saw the future of ProtagonistA's family , ProtagonistA's friends , and even the world 
 ProtagonistA saw the future of humanity , and it was a bright one 
 ProtagonistA saw a future where we all lived in peace and harmony 
There was once a boy who was known to everyone but ProtagonistA by ProtagonistA's given name – a boy called Noah , who was supposed to have been born in the year 1224 , on the very day that ProtagonistA was , according to some versions , murdered by a demon ProtagonistB was a strange boy , and people said that ProtagonistB had the eyes of a demon 
One day , ProtagonistA came up to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB why ProtagonistB was always alone 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA's parents what ProtagonistB had said to ProtagonistA , and they were very worried 
 ProtagonistA was a young woman who had been shipwrecked on a small island 
 ProtagonistA was the only survivor 
 ProtagonistA was terrified of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA begged for ProtagonistA's life , but ProtagonistB was determined 
 As ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA cursed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA swore that ProtagonistB would never find peace 
 ProtagonistA was very excited to finally have a chance to get to know them all better 
 ProtagonistA was always asking questions and exploring ProtagonistA's world 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole 
 ProtagonistA followed the rabbit down the hole and found ProtagonistA in a strange place 
 ProtagonistA met many interesting characters along the way , including the Mad Hatter and the Queen of Hearts 
 In the end , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's way back home and was very excited to tell ProtagonistA's family and friends about ProtagonistA's adventures 
 ProtagonistA believed ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA was special , that ProtagonistA was destined for greatness 
 And so ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to leave ProtagonistA's home and go on a quest to find the fabled City of Gold 
 For years , ProtagonistA searched the world for this city , never giving up hope that ProtagonistA would find it 
 And then , one day , ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA took over as its ruler , and ProtagonistA made it a place where everyone could be happy and live in peace 
 ProtagonistA ruled for many years , and the people loved ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't let that happen 
 ProtagonistA had to find a way to stop ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA could n't just kill ProtagonistB , because that would make ProtagonistA no better than ProtagonistB was 
 So ProtagonistA did the only thing ProtagonistA could think of 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB by the hand and led ProtagonistB away from the City of Gold , back into the wilderness , where ProtagonistB would never be able to hurt anyone ever again 
The first time I met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was in the kitchen of ProtagonistA's Nantucket house , stirring a pot of oysters and staring in the mirror 
 ProtagonistA had always been a free spirit , and ProtagonistA felt lost now that ProtagonistA was settled down in one place 
 ProtagonistA longed for adventure and excitement 
 As we sat and watched the water cascading down , ProtagonistA finally felt at peace 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA did n't need to find ProtagonistA's purpose in life , because it was already right in front of ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was dead , and ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB 
 With ProtagonistB dead , ProtagonistA was finally at peace 
ProtagonistA was a man , or at least ProtagonistA looked like one , of unquestionable fortune 
 ProtagonistA was the kind of woman who knew ProtagonistA's own power and reveled in it 
 ProtagonistA always got what ProtagonistA wanted , whether it was the latest designer handbag or the best table at the most exclusive restaurant 
 Oh , ProtagonistA had had ProtagonistA's fair share of suitors over the years 
 ProtagonistA had always been the one in control , the one who was never quite able to let go and simply be in the moment 
 And so , ProtagonistA had always been alone 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC 
 For the first time in ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could be ProtagonistA 
 And ProtagonistA loved it 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA let down ProtagonistA's guard and allowed ProtagonistA to be loved 
ProtagonistA was in a dream in which ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's family , ProtagonistA's friends , and ProtagonistA's dreams 
 ProtagonistA felt very happy and content , as if ProtagonistA had just met a dear friend 
There was ProtagonistA in a village where ProtagonistA had no name , and from whence ProtagonistA looked no more than a village - name ; and ProtagonistA was well known to everybody , and was a good , honest boy in everything 
 ProtagonistA could make things happen just by thinking about them 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking through the village when ProtagonistA saw a group of boys teasing a small dog 
 ProtagonistA was about to tell them to stop when ProtagonistA had a better idea 
 ProtagonistA focused ProtagonistA's thoughts on the boys , and wished that they would start feeling what the dog was feeling 
 ProtagonistA smiled to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had been able to help the dog , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could always rely on ProtagonistA's power when ProtagonistA needed to 
ProtagonistA had always been a creative soul 
 As a child , ProtagonistA loved making up stories and acting them out with ProtagonistA's friends 
 When ProtagonistA was a teenager , ProtagonistA began writing them down , and found that ProtagonistA had a real talent for it 
 By the time ProtagonistA reached ProtagonistA's thirtieth year , ProtagonistA was a celebrated author , and ProtagonistA's works were known and loved by many 
 One day , as ProtagonistA was working on ProtagonistA's latest novel , ProtagonistA had a strange feeling that someone was watching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA looked up , and sure enough , there were the works of M
 As ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA began to see the world in a new light 
 ProtagonistA poured ProtagonistA's heart and soul into ProtagonistA's work , and it showed 
 ProtagonistA was finally doing what ProtagonistA was meant to do , and ProtagonistA loved every minute of it 
ProtagonistA was sixteen , and ProtagonistA was a genius 
 ProtagonistA had always been a great student , but ProtagonistA was also a great artist 
 ProtagonistA had a gift for painting and drawing , and ProtagonistA was always creating new pieces of art 
 ProtagonistA was also a great musician , and ProtagonistA could play the piano and the violin 
 ProtagonistA was a talented young woman , and ProtagonistA was always looking for new ways to express ProtagonistA's talents 
When ProtagonistA was little , ProtagonistA said ,   ProtagonistA will hunt the sea , ProtagonistA will go and look for fish 
 ProtagonistA was always fascinated by the sea and the creatures that lived in it 
 ProtagonistA would spend hours looking at the waves and the fish swimming in the water 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was older , ProtagonistA went out in a boat with ProtagonistA's father 
 ProtagonistA was excited to finally be able to hunt the sea 
 ProtagonistA sat in the boat and waited for the fish to come 
 But ProtagonistA was determined to catch a fish 
 ProtagonistA refused to give up 
 Finally , after hours of waiting , ProtagonistA caught a fish 
 ProtagonistA was so excited and proud of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had finally done it 
 ProtagonistA had hunted the sea and caught a fish 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends were excited to see their favorite band perform live on a yacht 
ProtagonistA had always loved coming to ProtagonistA's cabin in the middle of the woods 
 ProtagonistA had been coming here since ProtagonistA was a child , and it always felt like coming home 
 Today , ProtagonistA was standing on the bank of Lake Superior , admiring the view 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw a group of people walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to see them , but ProtagonistA did n't say anything 
 ProtagonistA just watched as they walked past ProtagonistA and continued on their way 
 ProtagonistA wondered where they were going 
In the year of our Lord 1849 , in the month of May , ProtagonistA , came to the door of the house at 14 James Street , and said ProtagonistA was going to Washington to see the president 
 ProtagonistA had been planning the trip for months and had saved up ProtagonistA's money to pay for the train fare and ProtagonistA's expenses while ProtagonistA was there 
 ProtagonistA was excited to finally be going on ProtagonistA's adventure 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to see the sights in Washington and meet the president 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would have a wonderful time 
 ProtagonistA was able to see all of the sights that ProtagonistA had wanted to see and ProtagonistA even got to meet the president 
ProtagonistA was an orphan who lived in a very poor village 
 ProtagonistA had no parents and no siblings 
 ProtagonistA was very poor and had to work hard just to survive 
 ProtagonistA could not certainly prove it , but there were rumors that ProtagonistA had become very wealthy 
ProtagonistA had been on ProtagonistA's usual wife - beating sprawl for hours , after how deeply ProtagonistA had been in debt and wasted luxury 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping to find some relief in the bottom of a bottle , but it seemed that even that was not enough to take away the pain 
 ProtagonistA had just about given up hope when ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door 
 When ProtagonistA answered it , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA face to face with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had been wrong and that ProtagonistA needed to make things right 
 ProtagonistA was ready to face the consequences of ProtagonistA's actions and to start fresh 
In the year 1882 , ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB -- at Ull - west in the province of Wales 
 ProtagonistA wanted them to fly away and never come back 
 ProtagonistA was always the last one to be chosen for teams in gym class , the last one to be asked to the dances 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA it did n't bother ProtagonistA , that ProtagonistA was better off alone 
 But sometimes , when ProtagonistA saw the couples walking hand in hand down the street , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit jealous 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided enough was enough 
 ProtagonistA was going to make friends , even if it killed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA started by smiling at everyone ProtagonistA saw , saying hello to strangers 
 ProtagonistA joined clubs and went to social events 
 And finally , after years of being alone , ProtagonistA had made friends 
 ProtagonistA was happy , but ProtagonistA still felt a little bit like an outsider 
 ProtagonistA was never quite sure if ProtagonistA's friends truly liked ProtagonistA , or if they just tolerated ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA was content , and that was all that mattered 
 ProtagonistA was the only daughter of a wealthy family and ProtagonistA's parents died when ProtagonistA was very young 
 ProtagonistA had a little money , but ProtagonistA did not want to live on it 
 ProtagonistA wanted to work for ProtagonistA's living 
 ProtagonistA went to Dublin and got a situation as a governess in a large house 
 ProtagonistA was very happy in ProtagonistA's work and ProtagonistA loved the children ProtagonistA taught 
 The years passed and ProtagonistA grew to be a woman 
 ProtagonistA was still working in the same house , but ProtagonistA was no longer a governess 
 ProtagonistA was a companion to the lady of the house 
 ProtagonistA was still happy in ProtagonistA's work , but ProtagonistA had a great sorrow in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was very fond of ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's death was a great blow to ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA bore it bravely and went on with ProtagonistA's work 
 ProtagonistA was still living in the same house , but ProtagonistA was no longer a companion 
 ProtagonistA was a nurse 
 ProtagonistA was still kind and good to the children , but they were all grown up now and ProtagonistA was very lonely 
 ProtagonistA was very happy in ProtagonistA's visits 
 The years passed and ProtagonistA grew very old 
 ProtagonistA was still living in the same house , but ProtagonistA was very feeble now 
 ProtagonistA died a few days afterwards 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who loved to explore 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole and decided to follow it 
 ProtagonistA ended up in ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was excited to explore ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA soon realized that ProtagonistA was lost 
 ProtagonistA tried to find ProtagonistA's way back , but ProtagonistA could n't 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was stuck in ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA would never be able to go home 
 ProtagonistA would often go on walks in the woods near ProtagonistA's house , looking for new places to explore 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a small door in a tree 
 ProtagonistA had never seen it before , and ProtagonistA was curious to see what was inside 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and found a staircase leading down into the ground 
 ProtagonistA carefully stepped inside and began to descend 
 Finally , ProtagonistA reached the bottom and found ProtagonistA in a strange , dark place 
 ProtagonistA could see a light in the distance , and ProtagonistA began to walk towards it 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that the light was coming from a lamp on a table 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to have found this place and to have made a new friend 
 Despite this , ProtagonistA tried to live ProtagonistA's life to the best of ProtagonistA's abilities 
 ProtagonistA was always polite to those around ProtagonistA , no matter how they treated ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA always tried to help others , even if it meant ProtagonistA would be putting ProtagonistA in danger 
 And ProtagonistA always tried to stay positive , even when the world seemed like it was against ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA came across a group of men who were laughing and jeering at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA managed to get ProtagonistB to safety and tended to ProtagonistB's wounds 
 Even though the world was often cruel to ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA continued to try and make it a better place 
 ProtagonistA knew that it was worth it , even if the world did n't always show ProtagonistA that 
 ProtagonistA hope you can find happiness without ProtagonistA 
  With those words , ProtagonistA sealed ProtagonistA's envelope , put on ProtagonistA's coat , and walked out of my life for good 
 ProtagonistA was always pushing me to be someone I was n't , and I could n't take it anymore 
ProtagonistA was a young missionary who had been taught to share the gospel with those who were lost 
 ProtagonistA was very good at ProtagonistA's job and was always finding new ways to reach people 
 ProtagonistA could not share the gospel with those who were already saved 
 ProtagonistA tried to share the gospel with ProtagonistA's friends who were already Christians , but they just laughed at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was very discouraged 
 ProtagonistA did not understand why ProtagonistA could not share the gospel with ProtagonistA's Christian friends 
 ProtagonistA prayed about it and asked ProtagonistB to show ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was doing wrong 
 ProtagonistA was trying to force them to listen to ProtagonistA and to believe what ProtagonistA was saying 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA needed to share the gospel with ProtagonistA's Christian friends in a different way 
 ProtagonistA needed to show them the love of Christ 
 ProtagonistA needed to be a friend to them and to help them grow in their faith 
 ProtagonistA started to share the gospel with ProtagonistA's Christian friends in a new way 
 ProtagonistA showed them the love of Christ and helped them to grow in their faith 
 ProtagonistA was no longer trying to force them to listen to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was sharing the gospel with them in a way that was meaningful to them 
 ProtagonistA can do anything except what ProtagonistA has been taught to do 
ProtagonistA was a young woman with a heart full of love and a mind full of ideas 
 ProtagonistA was always looking for new ways to make the world a better place 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a book that spoke of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA searched high and low , but ProtagonistA could not find ProtagonistB 
 Finally , ProtagonistA came to the conclusion that the only way to find ProtagonistB was to die ProtagonistA 
 So , ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB coming for ProtagonistA 
 From that day on , ProtagonistA possessed the power to control death itself 
ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's time was up 
 ProtagonistA could feel it in ProtagonistA's bones 
 ProtagonistA was at peace with it , but ProtagonistA wanted to leave something behind 
 ProtagonistA spent the morning going through ProtagonistA's things , trying to decide what to give away and what to keep 
 In the end , ProtagonistA decided to leave everything to ProtagonistB 
 As ProtagonistA was finishing up , ProtagonistA noticed a tiny figure in the corner of the room 
 ProtagonistA smiled and waved , knowing that this would be the last time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA 
 And then ProtagonistA died 
 ProtagonistA had been in a dark place for a long time , and ProtagonistA thought that the mourner had been dead 
 But the mourner was alive , and ProtagonistA was happy to see the mourner 
 ProtagonistA spent the next few weeks in a coma , but eventually woke up and made a full recovery 
 ProtagonistA felt a bit self - conscious under their gaze , but ProtagonistA held ProtagonistA's head high and met their eyes 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider , and ProtagonistA was used to people staring at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a simple white dress that ProtagonistA had made ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had made ProtagonistA's way to the garden party that was being held in honor of the Queen 's birthday 
 ProtagonistA was always a bit uncomfortable at these types of events 
 But ProtagonistA had decided to come , and ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA did 
 Now that ProtagonistA was here , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA belonged 
 ProtagonistA walked over to a group of people who were talking and laughing 
 ProtagonistA laughed and talked with them , and ProtagonistA forgot all about feeling self - conscious 
 ProtagonistA danced and laughed , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was finally a part of something 
 ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had decided to come to the party , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would always remember the moment when ProtagonistA first walked into the garden and all eyes were on ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was excited to be assigned to ProtagonistB's cruiser 
 ProtagonistA had heard ProtagonistB was a famous young man with interests in politics and mathematics 
 ProtagonistA was eager to discover what kind of person ProtagonistB was 
 ProtagonistA was glad when the meeting was over 
 ProtagonistA was not sure what to make of ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was more interested in ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was a very wealthy woman 
 ProtagonistA lived in a big house and had a lot of money 
 ProtagonistA was always happy and always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 One day , ProtagonistA went to the store and saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt bad for ProtagonistB and decided to give ProtagonistB some money 
 ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB a hundred dollars 
ProtagonistA , said ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB , vivos in hac pulcher osvem agit , etiam mensis , velgetur , ut detenitur , velabit enim , verbi et deinde , tyrannosque potestatem 
 ProtagonistA sighed and began again , this time in Latin 
  Vivos in hac pulcher osvem agit , etiam mensis , velgetur , ut detenitur , velabit enim , verbi et deinde , tyrannosque potestatem ,  ProtagonistA said slowly and clearly 
 ProtagonistA was always able to see the best in people , and ProtagonistA was always quick to forgive 
 ProtagonistA was always quick to believe people , even when they were clearly lying to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had a lively mind and was one of the greatest of men 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a book that changed ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA became a powerful voice for change and helped many women achieve their dreams 
 ProtagonistA was the youngest of the bunch 
 ProtagonistA was a happy and lively child , always exploring and getting into mischief 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's family and was proud of ProtagonistA's heritage 
ProtagonistA had been living in Paris for two weeks , when ProtagonistA began to hear about a murder in Paris 
 As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like ProtagonistA was being watched 
 ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace and began to look over ProtagonistA's shoulder , but there was no one there 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA it was just ProtagonistA's imagination and continued on ProtagonistA's way 
 A few minutes later , ProtagonistA heard footsteps behind ProtagonistA and this time ProtagonistA was sure someone was following ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA began to run , but the footsteps got closer and closer until ProtagonistA felt a hand on ProtagonistA's shoulder 
 ProtagonistA turned around to see a man with a knife in his hand 
 ProtagonistA screamed , but it was too late 
ProtagonistA was excited to finally be able to share ProtagonistA's story with the world 
 ProtagonistA had been through so much in ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's story could help others 
 ProtagonistA walked through the open door and into the recording studio 
 ProtagonistA was ready to share ProtagonistA's story 
ProtagonistA was a young woman with a thirst for power 
 ProtagonistA was ambitious and driven , and ProtagonistA was determined to make a name for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA started out small , working ProtagonistA's way up the ladder in ProtagonistA's company 
 ProtagonistA was smart and manipulative , and ProtagonistA quickly rose to the top 
 ProtagonistA was ruthless in ProtagonistA's quest for power , and ProtagonistA soon became the most powerful woman in ProtagonistA's company 
 ProtagonistA was always one step ahead of ProtagonistA's competitors , and ProtagonistA always got what ProtagonistA wanted 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to take ProtagonistA's company public , and ProtagonistA made a fortune 
 ProtagonistA was now one of the richest women in the world , and ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA ever wanted 
 ProtagonistA wanted more , and ProtagonistA was determined to get it 
 ProtagonistA started to make deals with other companies , and ProtagonistA soon became the most powerful woman in the business world 
 ProtagonistA became too greedy and too power - hungry , and ProtagonistA made enemies 
 But ProtagonistA was a brave girl , and ProtagonistA had a dream to sail around the world 
 So , when ProtagonistA was sixteen , ProtagonistA set out from ProtagonistA's home in England , and ProtagonistA sailed around the world 
 But ProtagonistA always remembered ProtagonistA's dream , and ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had followed it 
ProtagonistA gazed upon the great pyramid of Isanaz and knew that ProtagonistA had to find a way inside 
 ProtagonistA had heard stories of the ancient treasures that were hidden within its walls , and ProtagonistA was determined to find them 
 ProtagonistA searched for a way in , but the pyramid was sealed tight 
 Finally , ProtagonistA found a small opening at the base of the pyramid and squeezed through 
 Once inside , ProtagonistA was amazed at the sight of the ancient treasures 
 ProtagonistA spent hours exploring the pyramid , and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never forget the experience 
 ProtagonistA was a healthy baby girl , and ProtagonistA's parents were overjoyed 
 ProtagonistA was a happy child , always smiling and giggling 
 ProtagonistA loved to play with ProtagonistA's toys and explore ProtagonistA's world 
 As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA became a beautiful young woman 
 ProtagonistA had many friends , and ProtagonistA's parents were very proud of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a good student and always worked hard 
 ProtagonistA was a happy , healthy baby girl who brought joy to ProtagonistA's family and friends 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful young woman who was loved by all who knew ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA lived a long , happy life and was an inspiration to everyone who knew ProtagonistA 
 The middle age is the hardest age for any man , and not for the better , said ProtagonistA , for it is some years after the death of his parents , that ProtagonistA come to the conclusion that the whole of humanity has become the same age , or , at best , a very long time into it 
When ProtagonistA was growing old , ProtagonistA 'd rather be the King of the Holy Land than the King of the City of the same name 
 ProtagonistA was from England , and ProtagonistA had come to Constantinople with ProtagonistA's husband , a merchant 
 ProtagonistA never forgot the kindness of ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was always grateful to ProtagonistB for giving ProtagonistA a second chance 
When ProtagonistA was seven , ProtagonistA learned how to read 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to finally be able to read all by ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA started reading every book ProtagonistA could get ProtagonistA's hands on 
 ProtagonistA loved getting lost in the stories and imagining what it would be like to be the characters in the book 
 ProtagonistA even started making up ProtagonistA's own stories 
 ProtagonistA would spend hours writing them down and then reading them aloud to anyone who would listen 
ProtagonistA had been walking for what felt like hours 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping to find a house soon , but so far ProtagonistA had n't had any luck 
 Finally , ProtagonistA came across a small cabin in the woods 
 As ProtagonistA walked all the way into the kitchen , ProtagonistA was hoping to find some food 
 Instead , ProtagonistA found a small fire burning in the fireplace 
 ProtagonistA was surprised that the fire was still lit and walked over to it 
 ProtagonistA was about to put ProtagonistA's legs through the doors and let the light burn on ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA heard a noise from the other room 
 ProtagonistA froze , not knowing what to do 
 Should ProtagonistA hide ? Or confront the person who was in the cabin with ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistA decided to hide and wait for the person to come into the kitchen 
 ProtagonistA was hoping that they would be friendly and that ProtagonistA could finally get something to eat 
 ProtagonistA was always asking questions and exploring ProtagonistA's world 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole 
 ProtagonistA followed the rabbit down the hole and found ProtagonistA in a strange place 
 The more ProtagonistA explored , the more curious ProtagonistA became 
  Of course , ProtagonistA being ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA had to see what was inside 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden 
 ProtagonistA was so fascinated by everything ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistA forgot to watch where ProtagonistA was going and fell into a deep sleep 
 If ProtagonistA did n't like something , ProtagonistA would let you know 
 ProtagonistA was at a party when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB wearing a dress that was too tight for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistB with a grin on ProtagonistA's face 
 You're wearing a dress that 's too small for ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was scared at first , but ProtagonistA soon realized that ProtagonistB was just a man 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could trust ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA thought about it for a while and then agreed 
 ProtagonistA was never lonely or scared again 
 ProtagonistA had the best life ProtagonistA could ever imagine 
ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life at the feast 
 But then ProtagonistA saw the girl go into the room where ProtagonistA was having ProtagonistA's feast 
 ProtagonistA was so angry that ProtagonistA threw a glass of wine at the girl and stormed out of the room 
 ProtagonistA had been up there for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had found out that ProtagonistA's parents were getting a divorce 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe that they were actually going to go through with it 
 ProtagonistA loved them both so much and ProtagonistA did n't want them to split up 
 ProtagonistA thought that maybe if ProtagonistA could just talk to them about it , they would change their minds 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was supposed to deal with this 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was losing everything that ProtagonistA loved 
 ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA did n't want to be here anymore 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to see ProtagonistA's parents fighting 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to see the pain in their eyes 
 So ProtagonistA climbed up to the roof of the house and ProtagonistA sat there for hours , just thinking 
 ProtagonistA thought about what ProtagonistA's life would be like if ProtagonistA's parents got divorced 
 ProtagonistA would have to choose between them 
 ProtagonistA would have to pick who ProtagonistA wanted to live with 
 And ProtagonistA did n't want to do that 
 ProtagonistA loved them both so much 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to lose either one of them 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA came to a decision 
 ProtagonistA could n't keep living like this 
 ProtagonistA could n't keep watching ProtagonistA's parents tear each other apart 
 So ProtagonistA decided to end it 
 ProtagonistA was going to jump off the roof and end ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA stood up on the edge of the roof , preparing to jump 
 But then ProtagonistA heard a voice 
 ProtagonistA hesitated 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to jump 
 But ProtagonistA did n't want to go back to ProtagonistB either 
 ProtagonistA was so torn 
 But then ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB's voice again 
 ProtagonistA could n't take it anymore 
 ProtagonistA could n't keep hurting ProtagonistB like this 
 So ProtagonistA stepped back from the edge of the roof and ProtagonistA went back inside 
 Because ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's parents 
 And ProtagonistA did n't want to lose either one of them 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider 
 ProtagonistA was never quite sure why , but ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA did n't quite fit in with the other kids at school 
 ProtagonistA wanted to get to know ProtagonistB better 
 One day , ProtagonistA mustered up the courage to speak to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and introduced ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA loved spending time with ProtagonistB 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistB was dealing with some personal issues 
 ProtagonistA was there for ProtagonistB though 
 ProtagonistA listened to ProtagonistB's vent and offered ProtagonistB a shoulder to cry on 
 ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA could be there for ProtagonistB during this tough time 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a black sheep in ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA was always the one doing things a little differently than everyone else 
 ProtagonistA had always been close with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was struggling with ProtagonistB's father 
 So , when ProtagonistA heard that ProtagonistB was thinking about taking ProtagonistB's own life , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do something 
 ProtagonistA could n't just sit by and watch ProtagonistB destroy ProtagonistB 
 So , ProtagonistA took matters into ProtagonistA's own hands and hired a team of assassins to kill ProtagonistB's father 
 ProtagonistA knew it was a risky move , but ProtagonistA was willing to do whatever it took to save ProtagonistB's life 
ProtagonistA was a simple girl who lived in a small village in England 
 ProtagonistA was out gathering firewood when ProtagonistA saw a bright light in the sky 
 ProtagonistA followed the light and it led ProtagonistA to a clearing where ProtagonistA saw a beautiful creature that ProtagonistA knew must be an angel 
 ProtagonistA was scared at first , but then ProtagonistA realized that this was ProtagonistA's destiny 
 ProtagonistA accepted the angel 's offer and was given a golden crown to wear 
 ProtagonistA was a few years younger than ProtagonistB , but the two girls quickly became friends 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and they both gasped 
 ProtagonistA followed the king , and ProtagonistA was indeed safe 
 ProtagonistA arrived in the new land , and ProtagonistA was free 
 ProtagonistA was grateful to the young girl who had appeared to ProtagonistA on Mount Sinai and given ProtagonistA the vision of the great king 
ProtagonistA had only ten fingers on each hand , but ProtagonistA was a very good pianist 
 ProtagonistA could play any song that ProtagonistA wanted to and ProtagonistA never got tired of playing the piano 
 Even though ProtagonistA had a lot of fun playing the piano , ProtagonistA always made sure to practice so that ProtagonistA could get better and better 
ProtagonistA died on a rainy day in 19 , 18 , so ProtagonistA was about 21 when I was born 
 ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's best friend and my godmother 
 ProtagonistA was the one who gave me my name 
 ProtagonistA died young 
 ProtagonistA was only in ProtagonistA's early twenties when ProtagonistA passed away 
 But ProtagonistA left a lasting impression on those who knew ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was kind and caring , always putting others first 
 ProtagonistA was the best friend anyone could ask for 
 I know ProtagonistA would have been there for me , if ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA will always have a special place in my heart 
 ProtagonistA was the one who gave me my name and my start in life 
ProtagonistA had always been a independent woman , and when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was the one for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA was not going to let ProtagonistA's family ruin ProtagonistA's happiness 
 ProtagonistA was a farmer , and ProtagonistA was very much concerned for the welfare of ProtagonistB's family 
 ProtagonistA had some of the best cattle and sheep in the country , and ProtagonistA was very fond of ProtagonistB's poultry 
 ProtagonistA had a good deal of money in ProtagonistB's account , where ProtagonistB could always find a good price for them 
 ProtagonistA had just had a terrible car accident that had left ProtagonistA in a wheelchair , inscrutable and unidentifiable 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA had been through enough pain and suffering , and that ProtagonistA was ready to die 
 Then ProtagonistA died 
ProtagonistA knew it was already too late to save the rest of the world ; but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forgive ProtagonistA for letting it happen 
 ProtagonistA watched as the world around ProtagonistA crumbled and burned ; all while ProtagonistA did nothing 
 ProtagonistA knew the people would hate ProtagonistA for what ProtagonistA had done ; or rather , what ProtagonistA had n't done 
 But ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA had let the world die 
 And ProtagonistA would never forgive ProtagonistA for it 
 ProtagonistA became a citizen and settled in East Anglia 
 ProtagonistA was a very quiet and shy person 
 ProtagonistA never married or had any children 
 ProtagonistA lived a very simple life 
 ProtagonistA was a spinster and lived alone 
 ProtagonistA was a very kind and gentle person 
 ProtagonistA was always helping others 
 ProtagonistA was a very religious person and went to church every Sunday 
 ProtagonistA was a very good person and always tried to do what was right 
 ProtagonistA died in 1346 at the age of 100 
ProtagonistA had been holding ProtagonistA's tongue for far too long 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being the doormat , the one everyone walked all over 
 ProtagonistA started with ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA did n't hold back , and it felt liberating 
 Next , ProtagonistA moved on to ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA told them off for always talking behind ProtagonistA's back , for always making ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistA was the odd one out 
 Lastly , ProtagonistA took on ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB exactly what ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistB's sexist , demeaning attitude 
 And ProtagonistA called me ProtagonistA's mother 
 ProtagonistA was a special child 
 ProtagonistA had a gift 
 ProtagonistA could see the beauty in the world , even when it was at its worst 
 ProtagonistA could see the good in people , even when they were at their worst 
 ProtagonistA was a light in the darkness 
 And ProtagonistA called me ProtagonistA's mother 
 And ProtagonistA called me her mother 
 ProtagonistA grew up to be a beautiful woman 
 ProtagonistA was kind and compassionate 
 ProtagonistA was a force for good in the world 
 ProtagonistA made a difference 
 And ProtagonistA called me ProtagonistA's mother 
 ProtagonistA is my daughter and my friend 
 ProtagonistA had left behind a record so depressing that it might have been sufficient even to establish the minimum standard of civilisation for that epoch , before any novel idea was entertained by any man , as to how to keep the record 
 ProtagonistA 's a big - shot warlord in the Middle East , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of money , and ProtagonistA 's got some big guns , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of bombs , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of guns 
 ProtagonistA 's a dangerous woman , and you 're going to see ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was on the deck of the great ship , looking up at the sun 
 ProtagonistA could feel the heat of the sun on ProtagonistA's skin , and the warmth of the light was like a hug 
 ProtagonistA felt alive and happy and hopeful 
ProtagonistA was always a kind and loving wife and mother 
 ProtagonistA was always quick to help out with the housework and would always take the time to listen to ProtagonistA's husband and children 
 ProtagonistA was always patient and would never get angry , even when things were tough 
ProtagonistA was walking through the narrow streets of Copenhagen , carefully avoiding the worst of the traffic 
 ProtagonistA was wearing ProtagonistA's best dress , and ProtagonistA did n't want to ruin it 
 As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 As ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB was carrying a large bouquet of flowers 
ProtagonistA went into the water and sat there , ProtagonistA , taking in the ship before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it before , and ProtagonistA was mesmerized by its size and beauty 
 ProtagonistA sat down next to ProtagonistA and began to speak , and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA entranced by ProtagonistA's words 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how long they sat there , but eventually the sun began to set and ProtagonistA got up to leave 
 ProtagonistA was reluctant to let ProtagonistA go , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to 
 As ProtagonistA walked away , ProtagonistA felt a deep sense of loss , as if ProtagonistA had just lost a part of ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was asleep in ProtagonistA's bed , and ProtagonistA dreamt that ProtagonistA was floating downstream in a river 
 ProtagonistA could feel the gentle current carrying ProtagonistA along , and ProtagonistA knew that wherever ProtagonistA was going , it would be alright 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let ProtagonistA drift off into the dream 
 We 're so glad ProtagonistA 're here 
  ProtagonistA smiled and said ,  Thank you 
There was once a boy with a very big , very round face and very large eyes and a very small head , but who was much more important than the rest of the boys in the school , and who had played a very important part in ProtagonistB's life , and whose name was ProtagonistA ; and ProtagonistA was a very good , well - behaved boy , and of a very good family , and in a very good school , and was a very useful and useful growth 
 ProtagonistA was always very polite to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was very fond of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was a great comfort to ProtagonistB in ProtagonistB's troubles , and ProtagonistB was very sorry when ProtagonistA left the school , and went away to live in the country 
ProtagonistA was a young woman with a passion for gardening 
 ProtagonistA loved nothing more than feeling the earth between ProtagonistA's fingers and watching ProtagonistA's plants grow 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to start ProtagonistA's own garden 
 ProtagonistA worked tirelessly , digging , planting , and watering ProtagonistA's plants 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was making ProtagonistA's mark on the world , one plant at a time 
 ProtagonistA had always been interested in the medical field , and had even considered becoming a doctor ProtagonistA at one point 
 But now , ProtagonistA just could n't see the point 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had been betrayed by the profession that ProtagonistA once held in such high regard 
ProtagonistA had not known the time when ProtagonistA would die , but it was an unpleasant year for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had been worse for it 
 ProtagonistA had been in and out of the hospital for months , and ProtagonistA's family had been by ProtagonistA's side the whole time 
 But now , ProtagonistA was getting worse 
 ProtagonistA was getting weaker and weaker , and the doctors said there was nothing more they could do 
One Sunday morning , ProtagonistA was making tea for the family when ProtagonistA was startled to discover that ProtagonistA's wife had gone into labour 
 ProtagonistA quickly called for an ambulance and ProtagonistA's wife was taken to the hospital 
 ProtagonistA was always a bright and happy child , always eager to learn and explore the world around ProtagonistA 
 Even as ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA never lost that sense of wonder and excitement , and it was always a pleasure to be around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 's always striving to learn new things and to better ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA 's an inspiration to everyone around ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest with ProtagonistB , when ProtagonistA suddenly felt the urge to pick up a large stick 
  ProtagonistA do n't know ,  ProtagonistA replied 
  ProtagonistA just feel like ProtagonistA need to pick up this stick and hit something with it 
 ProtagonistA picked up the stick and started swinging it around , hitting trees and bushes 
 ProtagonistA felt a sense of satisfaction with each thump of the stick against the foliage 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistA tired of swinging the stick and started to walk again 
There was once ProtagonistA ; and when ProtagonistA was six , and having already grown into a handsome and somewhat charming boy , and making ProtagonistA happy and prosperous by the exert , ProtagonistA was suddenly and rudely awakened by a shrill and most disagreeable noise 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistB was so charming and persistent that ProtagonistA eventually agreed to go for a walk with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA has been working towards ProtagonistA's goal ProtagonistA's entire life 
 ProtagonistA has made sacrifices and put in the hard work required to achieve success 
 Finally , ProtagonistA has reached ProtagonistA's goal 
 ProtagonistA is elated and relieved that all ProtagonistA's efforts have paid off 
 ProtagonistA can now enjoy the fruits of ProtagonistA's labour and live the life ProtagonistA has always wanted 
ProtagonistA stood upright , staring thoughtfully at the cold , silver plate before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had decided to end ProtagonistA's life on ProtagonistA's own terms , and so ProtagonistA had made the arrangements 
 Tonight , ProtagonistA would take a fatal dose of pills and then lay down on this cold , silver plate 
 ProtagonistA was at peace with ProtagonistA's decision , and ProtagonistA knew that this was the right thing to do 
 ProtagonistA said a final goodbye to the plate , and then took the pills

 ProtagonistA had 
 ProtagonistA died of a fever that , for many years afterward , caused even the most shocked Christians to reckon ProtagonistA blessed 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a book that changed ProtagonistA's life 
 After reading this book , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA wanted to be a storyteller 
 ProtagonistA started telling stories to anyone who would listen , and soon ProtagonistA had a following of people who loved ProtagonistA's stories 
ProtagonistA had just before ProtagonistA turned twenty - three had to endure what had hitherto been tolerable physical pain 
 ProtagonistA was in pain every day , but ProtagonistA tried to remain positive 
 Finally , ProtagonistA decided to take matters into ProtagonistA's own hands 
 ProtagonistA researched ProtagonistA's condition and found a experimental treatment that might help 
 It was risky , but ProtagonistA was willing to try anything 
 The treatment was successful and ProtagonistA was finally able to live pain - free 
By the time ProtagonistA was nine , ProtagonistA was already burning mad 
 ProtagonistA was mad at ProtagonistA's parents for getting divorced , mad at ProtagonistA's teachers for giving ProtagonistA bad grades , and mad at ProtagonistA's friends for not inviting ProtagonistA to their parties 
 ProtagonistA yelled at ProtagonistA's mom , threw ProtagonistA's alarm clock across the room , and stormed out of the house 
 ProtagonistA did n't speak to ProtagonistA's mom for weeks , and their relationship was never the same 
ProtagonistA had been in a coma for weeks , ever since the car accident 
 However , ProtagonistA was not the same person 
 ProtagonistA was confused and scared 
 ProtagonistA did not want to be in a new body and ProtagonistA did not want to be a different person 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be a warrior 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be strong and fight for what was right 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be respected and feared 
 But ProtagonistA was far from perfect 
 ProtagonistA was clumsy and always getting into trouble 
 And ProtagonistA was always getting into fights 
 But ProtagonistA never backed down 
 ProtagonistA never gave up 
 And ProtagonistA always fought for what ProtagonistA believed in 
 One day , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA could never be the perfect princess that ProtagonistA's family wanted ProtagonistA to be 
 But ProtagonistA could be the perfect warrior 
 And so ProtagonistA became a warrior 
 And ProtagonistA fought for what was right 
 And ProtagonistA was happy 
ProtagonistA was a man of extremely high moral character and , although ProtagonistA had the greatest number of notables of every description in the world , besides ProtagonistA's wife and children , was altogether a very poor man 
 ProtagonistA was a very bright girl and , when ProtagonistA was only eighteen , ProtagonistA won a scholarship to study at the prestigious University of Cambridge 
 After ProtagonistA graduated , ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB and they had three beautiful children together 
 ProtagonistA started ProtagonistA's own business and , within a few years , ProtagonistA had made it very successful 
 ProtagonistA was also a very charitable woman and ProtagonistA often helped those less fortunate than ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a true inspiration to everyone who knew ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA will always be remembered as a kind and caring person 
Once , when ProtagonistA was only eleven , ProtagonistA became really bored 
 ProtagonistA had read all the books in ProtagonistA's house , and there was nothing on TV 
 ProtagonistA went outside , but there was nobody to play with 
 ProtagonistA thought about going to the park , but it was too hot 
 ProtagonistA went back inside and sat down at the kitchen table 
 ProtagonistA started doodling on a piece of paper 
 ProtagonistA drew a picture of a cat , then a dog , then a house 
 ProtagonistA was about to draw a tree , when ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA got up from the table and followed the noise 
 ProtagonistA went to the door and knocked 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA would go get ProtagonistA's mom 
 ProtagonistA ran to ProtagonistA's house and got ProtagonistA's mom 
ProtagonistA was driving back from the library , listening to the end of a lecture when ProtagonistA was startled to find ProtagonistA in the middle of a city 
 ProtagonistA had been so engrossed in the lecture that ProtagonistA did n't realize ProtagonistA had driven into the city 
 ProtagonistA looked around , trying to orient ProtagonistA , when ProtagonistA saw a sign for the library 
 ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief and drove to the library 
ProtagonistA awoke to the sound of a cell door slamming shut 
 ProtagonistA was in a cell 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how long ProtagonistA had been there , but it felt like hours 
 ProtagonistA was thirsty and hungry 
 ProtagonistA tried to get ProtagonistB's attention 
 Hey ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA sat down on the floor and leaned ProtagonistA back against the cold concrete wall 
 ProtagonistA was trying to think of what ProtagonistA could have done to get ProtagonistA arrested 
 ProtagonistA must have been drugged , ProtagonistA thought 
 ProtagonistA sat up , confused 
 ProtagonistA had no idea what was going on , but it sounded serious 
 ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's feet and tried the cell door , but it was locked 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard voices in the hallway 
 ProtagonistA had no idea what was going to happen , but ProtagonistA knew it was n't going to be good 
ProtagonistA had never known the heart of a woman , and ProtagonistA did not even pretend to be surprised at ProtagonistB's romance 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider , never quite understanding the inner workings of the female heart 
 But ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB , even if ProtagonistA did n't quite understand it 
 But apparently , ProtagonistA was wrong 
 ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit jealous 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to find love again , but it had never happened for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit envious 
ProtagonistA had always been a rebellious girl 
 ProtagonistA grew up in a small town in France and was always getting into trouble 
 When ProtagonistA was 18 , ProtagonistA decided to leave ProtagonistA's hometown and move to Paris 
 ProtagonistA quickly became involved in the anarchist movement there 
 ProtagonistA was always looking for ways to fight the establishment 
 ProtagonistA saw the Montparnasse tower as a symbol of the rich and powerful 
 ProtagonistA decided to scale the side of the building and plant a bomb at the top 
 ProtagonistA was successful in ProtagonistA's mission and the bomb went off , destroying the top of the tower 
 As ProtagonistA watched the tower crumble , ProtagonistA felt a sense of satisfaction 
 ProtagonistA had made ProtagonistA's mark and shown the establishment that they could not control ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was going to China , but first ProtagonistA was going to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was very old and frail , so ProtagonistA was worried about ProtagonistB making the trip 
ProtagonistA , once remarked that ProtagonistA was inclined either to be a monster , or to be nothing at all 
 ProtagonistA was always a bit of an outsider , never quite fitting in with the other kids at school 
 And so , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was either a monster , or nothing at all 
 If ProtagonistA was a monster , then ProtagonistA did n't have to try to be something ProtagonistA was n't 
 ProtagonistA could just be ProtagonistA 
 But if ProtagonistA was nothing at all , then ProtagonistA could be anything ProtagonistA wanted to be 
ProtagonistA had been reading aloud from the ' History of the United States of America ' when ProtagonistA noticed a word in a Latin text on the back page 
 The word was ' quisling ' , and ProtagonistA was curious to know what it meant 
 ProtagonistA looked it up in the dictionary and found that it meant ' a traitor or collaborator ' 
 ProtagonistA was shocked to learn that there had been people in the United States who had betrayed their country and collaborated with the enemy 
ProtagonistA approached the throne upon an armchair not as a king , but as a dandy 
 ProtagonistA was a success , but no more than a short - cut 
 With ProtagonistA's wife at full term , ProtagonistA sat down to lunch and took a stool in the sofas on the other side of the table 
 ProtagonistA was content to be there , but ProtagonistA's mind was elsewhere 
ProtagonistA was a free woman who lived ProtagonistA's life to the fullest 
 ProtagonistA was always exploring and trying new things , which is how ProtagonistA ended up meeting ProtagonistB 
 Even though ProtagonistA was a free woman , ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was living in ProtagonistB's shadow 
 ProtagonistA was always second best and never seemed to be able to do anything right in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 After ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistA felt lost and alone 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to live ProtagonistA's life without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA ended up moving to a small town and starting a new life 
 ProtagonistA was finally able to be ProtagonistA's own person and do what ProtagonistA wanted 
 ProtagonistA was happy and content with ProtagonistA's new life
