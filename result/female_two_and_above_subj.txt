ProtagonistA was wearing the black trousers of a captain , a white shirt and a black blouse , with a red sash , and ProtagonistA's hair had been pulled back into a beautiful bun 
 ProtagonistA was the picture of a perfect naval officer , and ProtagonistA knew it 
 ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA could possibly want 
 ProtagonistA was lonely 
 ProtagonistA had never been able to find a partner who could match ProtagonistA's ambition and drive 
 ProtagonistA had given up hope of ever finding someone special 
 until ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 From the moment they met , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was the one for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that their love would last forever 
The day that ProtagonistA disobeyed ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would be in for a long lecture 
 But , ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA was tired of always having to do what ProtagonistA was told and ProtagonistA wanted to experience life for ProtagonistA 
 So , ProtagonistA went out into the world and did everything that ProtagonistA wanted to do 
 ProtagonistA climbed trees , got dirty , and stayed up late 
 And , when ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA was surprised to find that ProtagonistB was not mad at ProtagonistA at all 
 ProtagonistA never knew ProtagonistA's mother and ProtagonistA's father died when ProtagonistA was just a child 
 ProtagonistA had no money and no way to support ProtagonistA , so ProtagonistA did the only thing ProtagonistA could think of : ProtagonistA became a prostitute 
 For the next ten years , ProtagonistA worked the streets of Paris , selling ProtagonistA's body to anyone who would pay 
 ProtagonistA was never happy , but ProtagonistA survived 
 Then , one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA finally had the life ProtagonistA always wanted and ProtagonistA was happy 
ProtagonistA was a very pretty girl , far too pretty for ProtagonistA's age 
 ProtagonistA was always getting compliments from strangers and ProtagonistA loved it 
 ProtagonistA loved the attention and the way people made ProtagonistA feel 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking with ProtagonistA's friends when ProtagonistA saw a group of boys staring at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA smiled and walked over to them 
 ProtagonistA was only in middle school 
 ProtagonistA did n't care though 
 ProtagonistA flirted with them and ended up going home with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistB was older than ProtagonistA 
 All ProtagonistA cared about was the attention ProtagonistB was giving ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's bedroom , reading a book when ProtagonistA suddenly had a vision 
 In ProtagonistA's vision , ProtagonistA saw a great and terrible mystery 
 ProtagonistA saw a dark and foreboding castle , surrounded by a deep forest 
 In the castle , ProtagonistA saw a beautiful young woman , who was weeping 
 ProtagonistA also saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt drawn to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA had a sense that ProtagonistB was in danger 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , or how to help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to see what it was 
 When ProtagonistA got to the bottom of the stairs , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's cat , who had knocked over a vase 
 ProtagonistA sighed and went back to bed 
 But ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that ProtagonistA's vision was real , and that ProtagonistB was in danger 
It was one warm day in March , in a city so full of life that the air was full of everything that the wind might blow in , that ProtagonistA was driving along the street when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 That evening , ProtagonistA cooked ProtagonistB a meal of roasted chicken and vegetables 
 ProtagonistA was sorry to see ProtagonistB go when the time came , but they exchanged information and promised to keep in touch 
 ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistB , and they remained friends for many years 
 ProtagonistA was always glad that they had met that day , in that city so full of life 
ProtagonistB had been ill for some time , and ProtagonistA had been by ProtagonistB's side day and night 
 Now , in the little room of the King 's house within the great garden behind the house , ProtagonistA sat taking ProtagonistB's hand in she 
 But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB's time was running out , and that ProtagonistA must say goodbye 
 ProtagonistA leaned over and kissed ProtagonistB's forehead , then sat back and watched ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA remembered all the happy times they had together , and how ProtagonistB had always been there for ProtagonistA 
 Now ProtagonistA was the one who had to be strong 
 As ProtagonistA sat there , ProtagonistA saw a butterfly flutter into the room and land on ProtagonistB's chest 
 ProtagonistA smiled through ProtagonistA's tears and knew that ProtagonistB was telling ProtagonistA it was time to let ProtagonistB go 
 ProtagonistA stood up and leaned over ProtagonistB one last time 
  ProtagonistA love ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA whispered 
  Then ProtagonistA turned and walked out of the room , leaving ProtagonistB at peace 
ProtagonistA was not planning to marry , not until ProtagonistA had had ProtagonistA's fill of the immaculate manse 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a wild child and the thought of being tied down to one man and one house was not appealing 
 But then ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 Slowly but surely , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA falling in love with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was shocked but ProtagonistA said yes 
 And so , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA planning a wedding after all 
 But as ProtagonistA walked down the aisle towards ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had made the right decision 
ProtagonistA had been desirous of knowing what life would be like after ProtagonistA decided to have a baby , because ProtagonistA could not help but be curious , and had played the part of a constantly curious girl – uh … diary and all – in every conversation 
 ProtagonistA had read all the books and done all the research , but ProtagonistA still did n't feel like ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA was doing 
 Just thinking ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA never thought ProtagonistA would see the man who killed ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to say something , but ProtagonistA could n't think of anything 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to be anywhere near ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA did n't want ProtagonistC to touch ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't want ProtagonistC to hurt ProtagonistA 
 You killed ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's voice shaking 
 You did n't mean to kill ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA repeated , ProtagonistA's voice rising 
 ProtagonistA jerked away from ProtagonistC , ProtagonistA's heart pounding 
  Do n't touch ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA turned and ran , not looking back 
 ProtagonistA had to get away from ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA had to warn the others 
ProtagonistA has always been a bright and happy person , despite the fact that ProtagonistB had a heart of stone 
 ProtagonistA never understood why ProtagonistB was so cold and distant , but ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB anyway 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was older , ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB why ProtagonistB was so hard - hearted 
 ProtagonistA hugged ProtagonistB and promised to never let ProtagonistB down 
 To this day , ProtagonistA still thinks of ProtagonistB and the pain ProtagonistB must have gone through in ProtagonistB's life 
 ProtagonistA is determined to never let ProtagonistA get hurt like that , and to always be there for the people ProtagonistA loves 
ProtagonistA was one of the most popular women of ProtagonistA's day 
 ProtagonistA was beautiful , intelligent , and had a heart of gold 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were always doing something fun and exciting together 
 ProtagonistA and Bob 's love story came to a tragic end , however , when ProtagonistB passed away suddenly 
 ProtagonistA withdrew from society and became a recluse 
 ProtagonistA could n't bear to be around people anymore , as they reminded ProtagonistA too much of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA lived the rest of ProtagonistA's days alone , but ProtagonistA was content knowing that ProtagonistA had experienced the most perfect love story imaginable 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the edge of the water , eating a dinner of snowball peas and tarts , in the backyard of the house ProtagonistA had rented for the summer 
 It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was enjoying the peace and quiet of the small town ProtagonistA was in 
 ProtagonistA had just taken a bite of ProtagonistA's tart when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the other side of the water 
 ProtagonistA got up to see what it was , and saw a small boat coming towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA waved back , and ProtagonistB came ashore 
 ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistA's dinner , feeling happy that ProtagonistA had made ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a homebody , content to stay in ProtagonistA's small village and never venture too far from home 
 ProtagonistA was nervous but excited to be experiencing something new 
 As the guests chatter around ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA feels out of place and unsure of what to say 
 But then ProtagonistA notices ProtagonistB 
 Before long , ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA 's been transported back home , chatting away like ProtagonistA 's known ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's whole life 
 It 's only when ProtagonistB gets up to leave that ProtagonistA realizes ProtagonistA never even caught ProtagonistB's name 
 But in that moment , ProtagonistA feels grateful for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had a natural gift for color and composition , and ProtagonistB was very proud of ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was sitting at ProtagonistA's dining room table in the picture room , watching with some interest as the door of ProtagonistA's second class compartment was pushed open 
 ProtagonistA had been on the train for hours , and was looking forward to finally getting off and stretching ProtagonistA's legs 
 However , as the door opened , ProtagonistA saw that there was ProtagonistB in the compartment with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was immediately on guard 
 ProtagonistA had heard stories of people being robbed on trains , and ProtagonistA did n't want to be the next victim 
 ProtagonistA reached for ProtagonistA's purse , but ProtagonistB was quicker 
 ProtagonistA had worked hard for that money , and now ProtagonistA was going to have to start all over again 
 ProtagonistA was determined to catch ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was going to make ProtagonistB pay 
ProtagonistA was not sure if it was ProtagonistA's duty to help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was about to walk away when ProtagonistB spoke 
  ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment before ProtagonistA finally decided to help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's arm and helped ProtagonistB across the street 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful young woman with long blonde hair and blue eyes 
 ProtagonistA was very popular in ProtagonistA's school and had many friends 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking home from school with ProtagonistA's best friend , when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards them 
 ProtagonistA was very scared and ran away too 
 ProtagonistA ran home and told ProtagonistA's parents what had happened 
ProtagonistA went to bed in the morning , early , thinking of the presents ProtagonistA would be leaving ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had wrapped them all up and placed them under the tree , making sure ProtagonistB's name was on each one 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would be surprised and delighted when ProtagonistB opened them 
 ProtagonistA could n't wait to see the look on ProtagonistB's face 
ProtagonistA stood on the leadstaff of the slave ship and looked down at ProtagonistA's own bare feet 
 ProtagonistA had been on the ship for weeks , and it felt like a lifetime 
 One night , as ProtagonistA was lying in ProtagonistA's bunk , ProtagonistA heard a noise on deck 
 ProtagonistA got up to see what it was , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB climbing up the side of the ship 
 ProtagonistA was about to cry out for help , but ProtagonistA stopped ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB made ProtagonistB's way to the top of the ship , and then ProtagonistB jumped overboard 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
ProtagonistA was nine years old when ProtagonistA first heard of the death of ProtagonistA's father 
 ProtagonistA was playing in ProtagonistA's room when ProtagonistB came in and sat down on the edge of ProtagonistA's bed 
  ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA just sat there and stared at ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had just gotten home from celebrating the New Year with ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's pajamas and was about to get into bed when ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA got up to investigate and saw ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's apartment 
ProtagonistA was a fine , cheerful , cheerful girl of fifteen years of age , who had a cheerful manner , and good sense , but no very good sense ; and though ProtagonistA was wo nt to be a good - humoured and a happy - go - lucky girl , ProtagonistA was not without a certain air of melancholy 
 ProtagonistA had never had a friend like ProtagonistB before , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA falling in love with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew it was wrong , but ProtagonistA could n't help it 
 ProtagonistA would daydream about ProtagonistB , imagining what it would be like to be ProtagonistB's wife 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to go on without ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was the happiest ProtagonistA had ever been 
 ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that they would be happy together forever 
ProtagonistA was three years old when ProtagonistA was brought to bay in the arms of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was scared and confused , but ProtagonistB was kind and gentle 
 ProtagonistB explained that ProtagonistB was there to help ProtagonistA and that ProtagonistA was safe now 
ProtagonistA was always a tomboy 
 ProtagonistA loved playing sports and getting dirty 
 ProtagonistA loved the feeling of the sun on ProtagonistA's skin and the wind in ProtagonistA's hair 
 ProtagonistA saw a group of girls playing tag and ProtagonistA wanted to join in 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistA could , and ProtagonistB said yes 
 ProtagonistA ran over to the group of girls and asked if ProtagonistA could play 
 ProtagonistA was having so much fun 
 ProtagonistA was laughing and running and just enjoying ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to play anymore 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to go home 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB what the girl had said , and ProtagonistB just hugged ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 're a great player 
 And ProtagonistA 're a great person 
 ProtagonistA felt better after that , and ProtagonistA went out and played with ProtagonistA's friends again 
 And ProtagonistA never let anyone bring ProtagonistA down again 
ProtagonistA had always been a healthy man , so when ProtagonistA suddenly died on a day in 1812 , it came as a shock to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was always the one to help ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB was struggling , whether it was with school work or personal problems 
 Sadly , ProtagonistA lost ProtagonistA's battle with cancer a few months ago 
 Even though ProtagonistA is no longer with us , ProtagonistA will always be one of the greatest people ProtagonistB has ever known 
 ProtagonistA was a selfless person who always put others first , and ProtagonistB will never forget the impact ProtagonistA had on ProtagonistB's life 
 ProtagonistA has since remained a loyal and true subject of ProtagonistB , and has never wavered in ProtagonistA's love and support for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's rule 
The last time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a man 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what to say , so ProtagonistA just asked ProtagonistB how ProtagonistB was doing 
 ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB , and they talked for a while about ProtagonistB's transition and how ProtagonistB was feeling 
The first time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB dead , ProtagonistA felt the dread of death wash over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was at ProtagonistB's bedside when ProtagonistB passed away 
 ProtagonistA held ProtagonistB's hand and cried as ProtagonistA watched the life leave ProtagonistB's body 
 In that moment , ProtagonistA felt the dread of death for the first time 
 ProtagonistA realized that one day ProtagonistA would die too 
 ProtagonistA vowed to live each day to the fullest and to make ProtagonistB proud 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the corner of the sofa , with ProtagonistA's head resting on the edge of the sofa , when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the kitchen 
 ProtagonistA slowly got up and tip - toed towards the kitchen , only to find ProtagonistB , knocking over a vase 
 ProtagonistA scolded ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB ran off into the living room 
 ProtagonistA sighed and went back to ProtagonistA's spot on the sofa , only to be startled by a knock at the door 
 ProtagonistA got up to answer it , only to find no one there 
 ProtagonistA shrugged and went back to the living room , where ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB sleeping on the sofa 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and went to bed , only to be woken up by a noise in the kitchen 
 ProtagonistA got up and tip - toed towards the kitchen , only to find ProtagonistB , knocking over a vase 
 ProtagonistA scolded ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB ran off into the living room 
 ProtagonistA sighed and went back to ProtagonistA's spot on the sofa , only to be startled by a knock at the door 
 ProtagonistA got up to answer it , only to find no one there 
 ProtagonistA shrugged and went back to the living room , where ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB sleeping on the sofa 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and went to bed 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw a man walking hand in hand with a dead man 
 ProtagonistA felt a strong urge to help , but ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to get involved , but ProtagonistA could n't just walk away 
 ProtagonistA decided to follow them and see what they were up to 
 As ProtagonistA followed them , ProtagonistA saw the man stop and talk to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had made the right decision and ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had followed ProtagonistA's instinct 
 But ProtagonistA was a strong woman , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to be strong for ProtagonistA's children 
 ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to provide for Susan and Jethro , but it was difficult 
 ProtagonistA was grateful when ProtagonistA's brother , Joseph , offered to let them live in his tower 
 ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to tell them stories about ProtagonistB , but it was hard 
 ProtagonistA knew that they deserved to know the truth about ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA also knew that it would be too painful for them to hear 
 One day , ProtagonistA made the decision to tell Susan and Jethro the truth about ProtagonistB's death 
 And ProtagonistA knew that , no matter what , ProtagonistA would always be there for Susan and Jethro 
 ProtagonistA was staring up at the sky , wondering what ProtagonistA's life would be like if ProtagonistA could just float away 
 ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer , and this was ProtagonistA's favorite place to escape to 
 ProtagonistA would lie here for hours , letting ProtagonistA's mind wander to far off places 
 Sometimes ProtagonistA would imagine ProtagonistA was a bird , soaring through the sky , free from all ProtagonistA's troubles 
 Other times ProtagonistA would be ProtagonistB , being whisked away by ProtagonistB's prince charming 
 No matter where ProtagonistA's mind went , ProtagonistA always felt at peace when ProtagonistA was lying here 
 Even though ProtagonistA's friends teased ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA knew that they were just jealous 
One day in August , a winter in the West , ProtagonistA came to a village to pick up ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistA's father 's head and down at ProtagonistA's feet and said  ProtagonistB , go on 
  Then ProtagonistA walked away , leaving ProtagonistA's father behind 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was supposed to do or where ProtagonistA was supposed to go , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA walked for what felt like hours , until ProtagonistA finally came to a stop in front of a large door 
 ProtagonistA knocked and waited , but there was no answer 
 ProtagonistA knocked again , louder this time , and still there was no answer 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up and turn away when the door finally opened 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA spoke up 
 ProtagonistA should go there and look for ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistC and then ProtagonistA set off into the forest 
 ProtagonistA walked for what felt like hours , calling out for ProtagonistB , but there was no answer 
 ProtagonistA was just about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA followed the voice until ProtagonistA came to a clearing 
 There , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , waiting for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been sleepwalking again 
 It was something that ProtagonistA had done since ProtagonistA was a child and it always scared ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was a young woman who had been travelling on a ship with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had no food or water and ProtagonistA soon became very ill 
 On the second of April , ProtagonistA died of cholera 
 ProtagonistA was just seventeen years old 
 ProtagonistA died a painful death , all alone and far from home 
  ProtagonistA had come to say goodbye to ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA was also happy for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door , and ProtagonistB came to answer it 
 As ProtagonistA walked away , ProtagonistA looked back at the house one last time 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB , or the time they had spent together 
ProtagonistA had been drinking with ProtagonistB all evening , and ProtagonistA had been told to go to bed early , for ProtagonistA was going to spend all night with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA decided to drink some more of ProtagonistB's liquor , and ProtagonistA ended up passing out ProtagonistA 
 The next morning , ProtagonistA woke up with a headache and ProtagonistB was nowhere to be found 
 ProtagonistA had no idea what had happened to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was starting to worry 
ProtagonistA was a very kind and well - mannered young woman who always tried to do ProtagonistA's best to be polite and friendly to everyone ProtagonistA met 
 ProtagonistA lived in a small country town and was always of the opinion that ProtagonistA had great moral and intellectual advantages over ProtagonistA's neighbours 
 ProtagonistA believed that the best way to enjoy these advantages was to treat ProtagonistA's neighbours with the utmost civility and affability 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking around ProtagonistA's neighbourhood when ProtagonistA came across a group of children who were playing in the street 
 ProtagonistA decided to ask ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB thought the problem might be 
 From then on , ProtagonistA made it a point to be extra friendly to the children in ProtagonistA's neighbourhood and ProtagonistA soon became their favourite person 
 ProtagonistA would always stop to chat with them and ProtagonistA would always bring them treats 
 ProtagonistA was happy to know that ProtagonistA had made a difference in the lives of the children in ProtagonistA's neighbourhood and ProtagonistA was proud to know that ProtagonistA was respected and loved by them 
 ProtagonistA will go to ProtagonistA's room and stay there until I say ProtagonistA can come out 
 ProtagonistA felt the tears welling up in ProtagonistA's eyes , but ProtagonistA refused to give ProtagonistA's aunt the satisfaction of seeing them fall 
 Once ProtagonistA was inside , ProtagonistA allowed ProtagonistA to collapse onto the bed and cry 
 ProtagonistA was so tired of ProtagonistA's aunt 's abuse , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to escape it 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice outside ProtagonistA's window 
  ProtagonistA , climb out onto the roof and ProtagonistB 'll take ProtagonistA away from here 
 ProtagonistA looked out to see ProtagonistB standing on the edge of the roof 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to trust ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA climbed out the window and onto the roof 
 As they left , ProtagonistA looked back at ProtagonistA's aunt 's house , feeling relieved that ProtagonistA was finally free 
ProtagonistA stepped to the lectern and ProtagonistB did not interrupt ProtagonistA's position 
 ProtagonistA began to speak , but ProtagonistA was so nervous that ProtagonistA's words came out in a jumble 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and began again 
 ProtagonistA talked about ProtagonistA's passion for writing and how ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a writer 
ProtagonistA was fifteen when ProtagonistA walked into the shopper 's window of the stockade at Nightingale 's Gate , and into the room that was always there , and out of the dark , dusty floors 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it before , and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA had never seen anything so beautiful 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , so ProtagonistA just stood there , staring at the beautiful people and the beautiful room 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA did n't know , and ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA wanted to come with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA nodded , and ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB out of the room and into the stockade 
ProtagonistA was walking through the great halls of the castle on that snowy morning in March 
 ProtagonistA came face to face with ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistA 'm just exploring 
  ProtagonistA are not welcome here 
 I'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA did n't mean to intrude 
  ProtagonistA are not safe here 
 Why ?  ProtagonistA asked 
  ProtagonistA must go 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to go , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and turned to leave 
 As ProtagonistA walked away , ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB say ,  Be careful , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA are not alone in this world 
ProtagonistA is sitting alone in a hospital bed , across the way from ProtagonistA's home 
 ProtagonistA is feeling lonely and scared 
 ProtagonistA 's just about to drift off to sleep when ProtagonistA hears a voice 
  ProtagonistA turns to see a woman standing next to ProtagonistA's bed 
 Who are you ?  ProtagonistA asks 
 ProtagonistA is surprised 
  ProtagonistA did n't know ProtagonistA had a guardian angel 
 And with that , ProtagonistA feels a sense of peace wash over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA 's not alone anymore 
ProtagonistA was a well - built , long - legged , very pretty , pretty girl with a certain childlike air of innocence about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been dating ProtagonistC for a few months and they were very happy together 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out with ProtagonistA's girlfriends when ProtagonistA ran into ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was flattered by the attention but ProtagonistA did n't want to cheat on ProtagonistC , so ProtagonistA politely declined 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA gave in and they slept together 
 ProtagonistA felt guilty afterwards but ProtagonistA rationalized it by telling ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC would never find out 
ProtagonistA considered ProtagonistA the luckiest woman alive 
 ProtagonistA had a loving family , a beautiful home , and a successful career 
 However , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA did n't have everything 
 ProtagonistA was missing one important thing : a partner 
 ProtagonistA had never been in a relationship and ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA was the only one who was single 
 ProtagonistA wanted to find someone to share ProtagonistA's life with , but ProtagonistA did n't know where to start 
 One day , ProtagonistA went online and started looking for dating websites 
 ProtagonistA found one that looked promising and decided to give it a try 
 ProtagonistA created a profile and started browsing through the other members 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB and sent ProtagonistB a message 
 They 've been together ever since and ProtagonistA has never been happier 
 It 's a beautiful day , is n't it?Yes , it is ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA 've been wanting to talk to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA wanted to apologize ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA 've just been going through a lot 
 ProtagonistA hugged ProtagonistB tightly , relieved that ProtagonistB had forgiven ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA is a young girl who lives in a small town 
 ProtagonistA is an only child and ProtagonistA's parents are always busy with work 
 ProtagonistA is a very lonely girl 
 ProtagonistA tells it everything 
 ProtagonistA tells it ProtagonistA's secrets , ProtagonistA's hopes , and ProtagonistA's dreams 
 ProtagonistA is very excited 
 ProtagonistA ca n't wait to talk to the moon 
 ProtagonistA goes outside and sits in ProtagonistA's backyard 
 ProtagonistA looks up at the moon and starts to speak 
 ProtagonistA have so much to tell you 
 ProtagonistA made ProtagonistB today 
 ProtagonistA hope we can be friends forever 
 ProtagonistA continues to talk to the moon 
 ProtagonistA tells it about ProtagonistA's day and what ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA feels so happy and content 
 ProtagonistA feels like the moon is ProtagonistA's best friend 
 ProtagonistA was a young woman of nineteen , living in a small town in England 
 ProtagonistA had two brothers , one of whom was studying at university and the other was in the army 
 ProtagonistA was a very pretty girl , with dark hair and blue eyes 
 ProtagonistA was very shy and introverted , but ProtagonistA was also very intelligent and well - read 
 ProtagonistA loved to read , and ProtagonistA's dream was to one day write a book of ProtagonistA's own 
 One day , ProtagonistA received a letter from ProtagonistB , asking ProtagonistA to come and visit ProtagonistB in London 
 ProtagonistA was very excited , and ProtagonistA immediately packed ProtagonistA's bags and set off for the city 
 ProtagonistA arrived in London and was met by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was amazed by the sights and sounds of the city , and ProtagonistA quickly fell in love with it 
 ProtagonistA spent the next few days exploring London with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA soon realized that ProtagonistA could never go back to ProtagonistA's small town life 
 ProtagonistA had never been so happy in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was happy to finally be living ProtagonistA's dream life in the city 
 ProtagonistA was miserable , and ProtagonistA began to regret ever marrying ProtagonistC 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided enough was enough 
 ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and left ProtagonistC , vowing never to return 
 ProtagonistA moved back in with ProtagonistB and started to build a new life for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was finally free , and ProtagonistA was never going to let anyone control ProtagonistA again 
ProtagonistA had always been a bright girl 
 ProtagonistA was at the top of ProtagonistA's class and had always been told that ProtagonistA was destined for great things 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life the way it was and did n't see the need to further ProtagonistA's education 
 ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB but also felt a twinge of jealousy 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to go to college but had never had the opportunity 
  ProtagonistA 'm really happy for ProtagonistB 
 I know ProtagonistA always wanted to go to college , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment before answering 
  ProtagonistA did n't want to be thought of as dumb ,  ProtagonistA said finally 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 're not dumb 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been holding ProtagonistA back out of fear of what others might think 
 Thank ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA might apply to college after all 
 And with that , ProtagonistA took the first step towards fulfilling ProtagonistA's lifelong dream 
 ProtagonistA is a young girl who lives in a small town 
 ProtagonistA is an only child and ProtagonistA's parents are very strict 
 One day , ProtagonistA finds a box in ProtagonistA's attic which contains a beautiful dress 
 ProtagonistA puts on the dress and goes outside 
 ProtagonistA meets ProtagonistB and follows ProtagonistB down a rabbit hole 
 ProtagonistA has many adventures in this strange place 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA returns home 
 ProtagonistA is very sad 
 However , ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA can return to ProtagonistA's magical place whenever ProtagonistA wants 
When ProtagonistA was seven and ProtagonistA had nothing to do , ProtagonistA sat down on the floor of ProtagonistA's father 's bedroom and read a book , with a book in the lap of ProtagonistA's hand , holding the pages up against the light , and the light has never been the same again 
 ProtagonistA finished the book and sat there for a while , thinking about what ProtagonistA had just read 
 It was then that ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA could be anything ProtagonistA wanted to be , and ProtagonistA was never going to let anyone tell ProtagonistA what to do ever again 
 From that day on , ProtagonistA was a different person 
 ProtagonistA was more confident and sure of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could achieve anything ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the veranda of the front door with ProtagonistA's hands on the knob 
 ProtagonistA was about to go inside when ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA got up and followed the noise 
 ProtagonistA opened it and saw ProtagonistB crying 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's way home 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's hand and they started to walk 
 ProtagonistA walked with ProtagonistB to the house and knocked on the door 
ProtagonistA sits cross - legged on the floor of the dark alcove , ProtagonistA's fingers tracing the lines of a small painting 
 ProtagonistA ca n't see ProtagonistB's face , but ProtagonistA can feel ProtagonistB's pain 
 ProtagonistA feels ProtagonistB's pain , and ProtagonistA wants to help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA does n't know how , but ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA has to try 
ProtagonistA was on the eve of the most important visit of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was to meet the family of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was very nervous and excited about the meeting 
 ProtagonistA had heard so much about the family and was very curious to meet them 
 The next day , ProtagonistA met the family and was immediately impressed 
 ProtagonistA had a wonderful time with the family and was very sad to say goodbye when the time came 
 However , ProtagonistA was very grateful for the experience and the memories ProtagonistA had made 
 Even though ProtagonistA was different , ProtagonistA never felt like an outsider 
 ProtagonistA was always confident and comfortable in ProtagonistA's own skin 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was out exploring the woods near ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA came across a beautiful butterfly 
 ProtagonistA was so amazed by it that ProtagonistA reached out to touch it 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had been given a special gift 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was always with ProtagonistA , even when ProtagonistA was exploring new places 
ProtagonistA was in the middle of a heated battle with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so focused on the battle that ProtagonistA did n't see ProtagonistB's henchman sneaking up behind ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had driven for an entire day , and a whole day 's sleep , and had done nothing of note save to be driven to the place ProtagonistA was going to be raped 
 ProtagonistA had been planning to stop at a hotel for the night , but ProtagonistB had other plans 
 ProtagonistA was able to make it back to civilization , but ProtagonistA was forever changed by the ordeal 
ProtagonistA had been very wrong in ProtagonistA's belief that I would ever be with anyone , or marry anyone 
 ProtagonistA had seen me with many different women , and ProtagonistA knew that I was not the type to settle down 
 ProtagonistA was wrong 
ProtagonistA was sitting at ProtagonistA's typewriter , studying the words typed on the screen 
 ProtagonistA was trying to decide if ProtagonistA should keep going or not 
 ProtagonistA had been working on this story for weeks , and it just was n't coming together the way ProtagonistA wanted 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door 
 ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and there was ProtagonistB there with a package 
 ProtagonistA signed for it and took it inside 
 ProtagonistA opened it and found a typewriter just like ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA sat down and started typing 
 ProtagonistA sat back and smiled 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had made the right decision to keep going 
ProtagonistA was walking through the turnip bush when ProtagonistA was confronted by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA had ever seen ProtagonistB before , but ProtagonistB seemed familiar 
 ProtagonistA was getting tired and ProtagonistB offered to carry ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistA eventually agreed 
 ProtagonistA was so grateful and thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's help 
ProtagonistA has always considered ProtagonistA a strong , independent woman 
 So , when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was the one for ProtagonistA 
 So , when ProtagonistA marries ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA 's finally found ProtagonistA's true self 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who loved to explore 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole and decided to follow it 
 ProtagonistA ended up in ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had many adventures in ProtagonistB and made many new friends 
 ProtagonistA even met a talking cat ! Eventually , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's way back home and ProtagonistA was very happy to be reunited with ProtagonistA's family 
ProtagonistA ran with alacrity through several miles of fields , forests , and meadows , bearing with ProtagonistA the great stuff of life : the apple , the bramble , the cherry - tree , the thorn - trees , and so many trees , some two hundred yards in circumference 
 ProtagonistA had been running for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting tired 
 But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 ProtagonistA had to find the place where the trees stopped 
  ProtagonistA had never seen grass before , but ProtagonistA had heard that it was soft and green and smelled good 
 ProtagonistA was hoping that ProtagonistA would find this place soon 
 Finally , ProtagonistA came to a clearing 
 ProtagonistA stopped and looked at the tree 
 It was so big ! ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA quickly hid behind the tree and waited 
 ProtagonistA could see movement through the trees , and then ProtagonistA saw a person 
 ProtagonistA slowly came out from behind the tree 
  ProtagonistA's name is Alice ,  ProtagonistA said 
  Where are ProtagonistA going?I'm looking for the place where the trees stop ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB through the trees 
 ProtagonistA looked around 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it ! It was so beautiful ! ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it 
 Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA had been feeling off for a while 
 ProtagonistA was tired all the time and ProtagonistA's joints were aching 
 ProtagonistA thought it was just a phase ProtagonistA was going through and did n't think much of it 
 But when ProtagonistA started to get short of breath and started to see spots in ProtagonistA's vision , ProtagonistA knew something was n't right 
 ProtagonistA made an appointment to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had high blood pressure and was in the early stages of dementia 
 It was a lot to take in , but ProtagonistA was grateful to have a diagnosis and a plan to help ProtagonistA manage ProtagonistA's condition 
 ProtagonistA was also very smart , and could read and write better than most adults 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was out playing with ProtagonistA's friends , ProtagonistA found a rabbit hole 
 ProtagonistA was curious , so ProtagonistA decided to follow the rabbit down the hole 
 ProtagonistA ended up in ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was very curious about ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA met all sorts of interesting creatures 
 ProtagonistA even met the Queen of Hearts , who was not very nice 
 But ProtagonistA was not afraid , and ProtagonistA eventually made ProtagonistA's way back home 
 ProtagonistA was happy to oblige , and ProtagonistA told them everything that had happened 
 ProtagonistA even showed them the pictures ProtagonistA had drawn of all the creatures ProtagonistA had met 
 ProtagonistA believed them , and ProtagonistA went on to have many more adventures 
 ProtagonistA even wrote a book about ProtagonistA's experiences in ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was a very special girl , and ProtagonistA will always be remembered for ProtagonistA's amazing adventure 
ProtagonistA was walking through town on the left hand side of the road when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA wondered if ProtagonistB was a boy or a girl 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB's name was 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who lived in a small town 
 ProtagonistA was very shy and never spoke to anyone 
 One day , ProtagonistA saw a rabbit in ProtagonistA's garden and followed it into a hole 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a strange place where ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden where ProtagonistA met a handsome prince 
When ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's seventies , ProtagonistA was walking ProtagonistB 
 One day , while they were out walking , ProtagonistA slipped and fell 
 ProtagonistA was grateful to have ProtagonistB by ProtagonistA's side 
The night before ProtagonistA drowned , ProtagonistA had a dream , as it were 
 ProtagonistA dreamed that ProtagonistA was walking along a path by a river 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB playing near the water 's edge and ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB , warning ProtagonistB to be careful 
 ProtagonistA ran to the edge of the river , but ProtagonistA could n't reach ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA watched helplessly as ProtagonistB was swept away by the current 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was crying 
ProtagonistA called ProtagonistB by ProtagonistA's surname , and we have been called by it ever since 
 ProtagonistA was looking forward to relaxing in ProtagonistA's warm apartment , but first ProtagonistA had to make a phone call 
 ProtagonistA dialed the number and waited for someone to answer 
ProtagonistA , with ProtagonistB , at ProtagonistA's side , rode out into the great wide plain of Phlegethon , where ProtagonistA found the rest of ProtagonistA's family in the company of Mrs
 ProtagonistA lay still , unconscious 
 And ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA stammered ,  ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB in a dark alley 
 ProtagonistA ran away and hid in a nearby store 
 ProtagonistA called the police and they came and arrested ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a woman who enjoyed the art of murdering 
 ProtagonistA was also a man who enjoyed the art of murdering 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to kill ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA lured ProtagonistB into a dark alley and stabbed ProtagonistB to death 
 As ProtagonistA walked away , ProtagonistA felt a sense of satisfaction 
 ProtagonistA had finally gotten ProtagonistA's revenge 
 Fearing for ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA hastily packed a few belongings and set out for the palace 
 ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA had been afraid for ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was with ProtagonistB at the time and they were both drunk 
 ProtagonistA was a large , well - dressed woman , with a pleasant face and a kind voice 
 ProtagonistA was sitting behind a desk , and ProtagonistA motioned for the men to sit down 
 ProtagonistA asked them how they were , and they all said that they were fine 
 ProtagonistA asked them if they had any news , and they all said that they did not 
 Finally , ProtagonistA asked them why they had come to see ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA leaned back in ProtagonistA's chair and listened as ProtagonistB explained the situation 
 ProtagonistA thought for a moment , and then ProtagonistA agreed to help them 
 ProtagonistA told them that ProtagonistA would give them each a loan of £ 400 
 I'm a good Christian woman ,  ProtagonistA said 
  And ProtagonistA believe that it is ProtagonistA's duty to help those in need 
 ProtagonistA sat back in ProtagonistA's chair and smiled 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have been able to help the men , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had made the right decision 
ProtagonistA was walking after dark when ProtagonistA heard a noise behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB following ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA started to run , but ProtagonistB ran after ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA screamed for help , but no one came 
 ProtagonistA fought back , but ProtagonistB was too strong 
 ProtagonistA lay there , bleeding and in pain , until ProtagonistA died 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who had a fear of abandonment 
 ProtagonistA was always afraid that someone would leave ProtagonistA , or that ProtagonistA would be alone 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's family and friends , but ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was the odd one out 
 When ProtagonistA was a little old man , ProtagonistA saw everything in the world and ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistA would never be able to find love 
 ProtagonistA was wrong 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had always loved the stone house in ProtagonistE's garden 
 ProtagonistA would pretend ProtagonistA was a princess living in a castle , and the stone house was ProtagonistA's fortress 
 As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to wonder about the history of the house 
 Who had built it ? Why was it built on the foundation of an old house?One day , as ProtagonistA stood in the garden , tracing the outlines of the structure ProtagonistA had built there , the man who would become known as the Great Scribe of the Old Testament , or , as some people called ProtagonistB , the Habite Cretan , or simply the Lost Scribe , began to write 
 And ProtagonistA would always remember ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had been shopping online for ProtagonistA's groceries for weeks , and ProtagonistA always used Walmart 
 ProtagonistA was happy with the prices and the selection , and ProtagonistA never had any problems 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistA had a tussle with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so angry that ProtagonistA decided to never shop at Walmart again 
ProtagonistA rose early that morning , lifting ProtagonistA's ten - pound hammer from the table before she and pounding the ground 
 ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's house for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to see some progress 
 ProtagonistA was determined to finish it by ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was not going to let anything stop ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA worked , ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's life and how much it had changed in the past year 
 ProtagonistA used to be a happy , carefree person , but now ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was constantly fighting just to keep ProtagonistA's head above water 
 ProtagonistA worked all morning , and by the time lunchtime rolled around , ProtagonistA was ready to take a break 
 ProtagonistA was just about to sit down when ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance 
 ProtagonistA followed the sound until ProtagonistA came to a clearing 
 There , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB sitting on the ground , crying ProtagonistB's eyes out 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistA could n't just leave ProtagonistB there 
 ProtagonistA sat down next to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say , but ProtagonistA hugged ProtagonistB tightly 
 ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistB that everything was going to be alright , even though ProtagonistA did n't know if that was true 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's own life and how ProtagonistA was also going through a tough time 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA helped ProtagonistB to ProtagonistB's feet and walked ProtagonistB's home 
 ProtagonistA made sure to get ProtagonistB's address so ProtagonistA could keep in touch 
 ProtagonistA went home feeling exhausted , but also grateful 
 ProtagonistA was determined to help them however ProtagonistA could 
ProtagonistA was the god of the seas , and ProtagonistB had a hard time determining ProtagonistB's true identity 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA was approached by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA tried to explain to ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA did n't have that much money on ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB did n't believe ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB threatened to call the police if ProtagonistA did n't give ProtagonistB the money , so ProtagonistA reluctantly gave ProtagonistB the money 
ProtagonistA was finding it difficult to focus on ProtagonistA's reading 
 It was an afternoon of some utility ; it was the middle of January , 1863 , and ProtagonistA was working ProtagonistA's way through an appendix to the first edition of The Origin of Species , which ProtagonistA was carrying with ProtagonistA on ProtagonistA's arm at all times , though ProtagonistA was at times so much employed as to be at rest 
 ProtagonistA kept getting distracted by ProtagonistA's thoughts , which kept wandering to the current state of affairs 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but worry about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB terribly and wondered if ProtagonistA would ever see ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistA forced ProtagonistA to focus on ProtagonistA's reading again 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA needed to keep ProtagonistA's mind occupied or ProtagonistA would go crazy with worry 
 ProtagonistA read on , but ProtagonistA's mind kept wandering 
 ProtagonistA was so delighted that ProtagonistA could hardly contain ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA went at once to tell ProtagonistA's father and mother of the good news 
 ProtagonistA noticed , however , that the Queen looked very stern and angry , and ProtagonistA wondered what was the matter 
 After a time ProtagonistA was sorry ProtagonistA had come , for the Queen kept scowling at ProtagonistA so fiercely that it quite frightened ProtagonistA ; and then , when ProtagonistA was tired of dancing , ProtagonistA wanted to go home , but ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA must stay till midnight 
 As ProtagonistA was leaving the hall the Queen said to ProtagonistA in a loud voice ,  ProtagonistA are nothing but a common little girl , and I 'll have ProtagonistA sent to prison for coming here without an ProtagonistA was so astonished at this that ProtagonistA could not speak ; but ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA outside the palace doors in a moment , and running down the steps as fast as ProtagonistA could 
ProtagonistA did not know whether ProtagonistA should rejoice or cry 
 As ProtagonistA sat at ProtagonistA's desk , ProtagonistA vacillated between feelings of happiness and sadness 
  Yes , ProtagonistA 'm fine ,  ProtagonistA replied , forced a smile 
ProtagonistA was waiting for ProtagonistB , just as ProtagonistA usually was 
 ProtagonistA checked ProtagonistA's watch and tapping ProtagonistA's foot impatiently 
 ProtagonistA was just about to give up and go home when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB running towards ProtagonistA , out of breath 
   It 's fine ,  ProtagonistA replied , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little disappointed 
 ProtagonistA had been looking forward to spending time with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA comes at night , the terror of ProtagonistA's lips , limber and voice , stronger than the deathbringer that lay before ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's teeth are black from blood 
 ProtagonistA had killed before , but never like this 
 ProtagonistA was a predator , and ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's prey 
 ProtagonistA could see the fear in ProtagonistB's eyes , and ProtagonistA reveled in it 
 ProtagonistA was going to enjoy this 
 ProtagonistA leaned in close , ProtagonistA lips inches from ProtagonistB's neck , and ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistB's pulse racing 
 ProtagonistA could smell the fear on ProtagonistB , and it was intoxicating 
 ProtagonistA smiled , and then ProtagonistA struck 
ProtagonistA had just become a full - grown man , and ProtagonistB was already paying ProtagonistA's attention 
 ProtagonistA had never heard of ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistA did n't want to show ProtagonistA's ignorance 
 ProtagonistA smiled back at ProtagonistB and said ,  Of course ProtagonistA have 
 Really ?  ProtagonistA said , genuinely interested 
  ProtagonistA 'd love to read it when it 's finished 
There was once a boy who was known to everyone but ProtagonistA by ProtagonistA's given name – a boy called Noah , who was supposed to have been born in the year 1224 , on the very day that ProtagonistA was , according to some versions , murdered by a demon 
 ProtagonistA was the only person who knew ProtagonistB's true identity – and ProtagonistA was the only one who knew that ProtagonistB was n't really a boy at all , but a creature from another world who had come to Earth in order to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB became friends , and together they were able to defeat the demon 
 ProtagonistA was sad to see ProtagonistB go , but ProtagonistA was also happy that ProtagonistB had been able to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that they would always be friends , no matter what 
 ProtagonistA felt right at home with ProtagonistA's new family and knew that ProtagonistA would always be loved and accepted by them 
 ProtagonistA was always a special girl , even from a young age 
 ProtagonistA always seemed to have a greater purpose 
 As ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA realised that what ProtagonistB had said was true 
 And ProtagonistA was going to make the best of it 
 ProtagonistA was going to make it a better place for everyone 
 And ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB for it 
ProtagonistA was dead , and ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was terrified of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did n't want to disobey ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA did n't marry ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB would kill ProtagonistA 
 So , ProtagonistA agreed to marry ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was miserable , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to pretend to be happy 
 ProtagonistA cried and begged ProtagonistB to stop , but ProtagonistB did n't listen 
ProtagonistA was a man , or at least ProtagonistA looked like one , of unquestionable fortune 
 ProtagonistA was the kind of person that made others uncomfortable without knowing why 
 ProtagonistA always had a feeling that ProtagonistA was different from everyone else , but ProtagonistA could n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on why 
 ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was playing a role in some grand performance , but ProtagonistA did n't know what the end goal was 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to find out more about ProtagonistA's past 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's parents ' house and rummaged through their things , looking for anything that could give ProtagonistA a clue 
 ProtagonistA found a box hidden away in a cupboard that contained old letters and photos 
 As ProtagonistA looked through the contents of the box , ProtagonistA finally began to piece together the truth 
 ProtagonistA felt like everything suddenly made sense 
 ProtagonistA was a man , or at least ProtagonistA looked like one , because that 's what ProtagonistA's parents had raised ProtagonistA to be 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA owed it to ProtagonistA's parents to make something of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was going to make them proud , even if they were no longer alive to see it 
ProtagonistA was in a dream in which ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was very interested in everything ProtagonistB had to say 
 When ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA was surprised to find that ProtagonistA was actually in ProtagonistB's arms 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how it was possible , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 All ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistA was happy to be there 
There was ProtagonistA in a village where ProtagonistA had no name , and from whence ProtagonistA looked no more than a village - name ; and ProtagonistA was well known to everybody , and was a good , honest boy in everything 
 And ProtagonistB said to ProtagonistA ,  What is ProtagonistA's name ?  And ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA have no name 
 ProtagonistA had always enjoyed ProtagonistB's novels , but never dreamed that ProtagonistA would one day have the opportunity to meet ProtagonistB in person 
In the year of our Lord 1849 , in the month of May , ProtagonistA , came to the door of the house at 14 James Street , and said ProtagonistA was going to Washington to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was their only child 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful young woman , with blonde hair and blue eyes 
 ProtagonistA was very intelligent and well - educated 
 ProtagonistA had been to Europe and had seen many famous people 
 But ProtagonistA had never been to Washington to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA had heard that ProtagonistB was a very important man , and ProtagonistA wanted to meet ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA was very determined to go 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA would be very careful and would take a chaperone with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was very excited about ProtagonistA's trip 
 ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and left for Washington the next day 
 ProtagonistA had a wonderful time in Washington 
 ProtagonistA met many famous people , including ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA saw many interesting sights 
 ProtagonistA even got to go to the White House and meet ProtagonistB's wife 
 When ProtagonistA returned home , ProtagonistA was very excited to tell ProtagonistA's parents about ProtagonistA's trip 
 ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had gone to Washington 
 It was a trip ProtagonistA would never forget 
ProtagonistA was an orphan who lived in a very poor village 
 ProtagonistA often helped the other villagers with their chores , and they would often give ProtagonistA food or clothes in return 
 ProtagonistA agreed , and ProtagonistA eventually found the dog 
 With this gold , ProtagonistA was able to buy a new house and clothes for ProtagonistA and the other villagers 
 ProtagonistA also helped the village by paying for the repairs of the village well 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who loved to explore 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB in the forest 
 ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB for hours , until ProtagonistA came to a large door 
 Once ProtagonistA was through the door , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a very different place 
 ProtagonistA was so fascinated by this new place that ProtagonistA forgot all about ProtagonistB 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to leave 
 But ProtagonistA did n't listen 
 ProtagonistA was having too much fun 
 ProtagonistA loved to daydream and make up stories in ProtagonistA's head 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking in the forest when ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and found ProtagonistA in a strange place 
 ProtagonistA began to explore and found a table with a big cake on it 
 The cake said  EAT ME  so ProtagonistA took a bite 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA began to grow and grow until ProtagonistA was as big as the house 
 ProtagonistA found a little door that ProtagonistA could fit through and squeezed ProtagonistA through it 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden 
 ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life until ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to leave , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to 
 ProtagonistA said goodbye to the garden and followed ProtagonistB home 
 ProtagonistA was always helping ProtagonistA's parents with their work , and ProtagonistA was always willing to lend a hand to anyone who needed it 
 However , when ProtagonistA was older , ProtagonistA began to realize that there were some things that ProtagonistA could do that ProtagonistA's parents could n't 
 ProtagonistA began to feel like ProtagonistA was different from them and that ProtagonistA had a special gift 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out helping ProtagonistA's parents with their work when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA went over to help ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was able to carry ProtagonistB's groceries for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA could use ProtagonistA's gifts to help others in ways that ProtagonistA's parents could n't 
 ProtagonistA began to feel more confident in ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's abilities 
 ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA was making a difference in the world 
ProtagonistA had always been a special girl 
 ProtagonistA possessed a power that no one else had 
 ProtagonistA had never used ProtagonistA's power for evil 
 ProtagonistA had only ever used it to help others 
 But ProtagonistA knew that there were those who would misuse ProtagonistA's power if they knew about it 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA was skeptical 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to misuse ProtagonistA's power 
 And so , ProtagonistA decided to trust ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a very wealthy woman who lived in a huge mansion 
 ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA could ever want , but ProtagonistA was very lonely 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to go for a walk in the park 
 There , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who lived in a small village 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking when ProtagonistA came across a centurion 
 ProtagonistA was terrified but the centurion was very kind to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA living in a luxurious tent 
 ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA could ever want but ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's family and friends 
 ProtagonistA was scared but ProtagonistB promised to protect ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was happy in ProtagonistA's new life but ProtagonistA always wondered what happened to ProtagonistA's family and friends 
ProtagonistA had been living in Paris for two weeks , when ProtagonistA began to hear about a murder in Paris 
 ProtagonistA spoke to the police and found out that ProtagonistB had been killed by ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA helped them to track down ProtagonistC and ProtagonistC was arrested 
 ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA could help to bring justice to ProtagonistB's family 
ProtagonistA had always wanted to see the great pyramid of Isanaz 
 ProtagonistA had seen pictures of it , but they did n't do it justice 
 Finally , ProtagonistA was standing before it , and ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA stood there for a long time , just admiring it 
 ProtagonistA was so entranced by the pyramid that ProtagonistA did n't even hear someone come up to ProtagonistA until they spoke 
 Yes , it is ,  ProtagonistA said 
 That 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA will never forget the time ProtagonistA spent admiring the great pyramid of Isanaz 
 ProtagonistA was a healthy baby , and ProtagonistA thrived in the care of ProtagonistA's parents 
 ProtagonistA was a happy child , always smiling and laughing 
 ProtagonistA loved to play outside , and ProtagonistA would often run and chase the chickens around the yard 
 As ProtagonistA grew , ProtagonistA continued to bring happiness to ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA was always eager to help with whatever needed to be done , whether it was cooking , cleaning , or caring for ProtagonistA's younger siblings 
 ProtagonistA was a hard worker , and ProtagonistA was always willing to lend a helping hand 
 ProtagonistA was a kind and compassionate person , always looking out for others 
 ProtagonistA would often go out of ProtagonistA's way to help someone in need , and ProtagonistA was always quick to offer a kind word or a shoulder to cry on 
 ProtagonistA was a special person , and ProtagonistA touched the lives of everyone ProtagonistA met 
 ProtagonistA was a young woman who had been forced to flee ProtagonistA's home in Spain when the Moors invaded 
 ProtagonistA was amazed at the sights and sounds of the city , and ProtagonistB was equally amazed at ProtagonistA's reaction 
 As they made their escape , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA true calling in life 
ProtagonistA was in a foul mood 
 ProtagonistA had a grin on ProtagonistA's face that let everyone know that they should beware 
 ProtagonistA was ready to give someone a piece of ProtagonistA's mind 
 It did n't matter who it was , ProtagonistA was going to let them have it 
 As ProtagonistA walked down the street , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and said ,  ProtagonistB 're a terrible dog owner 
 ProtagonistA continued to berate ProtagonistB until ProtagonistB was in tears 
 When ProtagonistA was done , ProtagonistA walked away with a satisfied smirk on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA had given someone a piece of ProtagonistA's mind and it felt good 
ProtagonistA was walking home from school when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing in ProtagonistA's path 
 ProtagonistA knew who ProtagonistB was immediately 
  ProtagonistA knew better than to make a deal with ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was curious to hear what ProtagonistB had to say 
 ProtagonistA will be rich , beautiful , and loved by everyone 
  No , thank ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'm not interested 
 ProtagonistA had made ProtagonistA's decision and there was no changing it 
ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life at the feast 
 ProtagonistA was so angry that ProtagonistA threw a plate at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was determined to make ProtagonistB pay for ruining ProtagonistA's feast 
ProtagonistA was walking to ProtagonistA's office when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB was okay 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart break for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB by the hand and led ProtagonistB into ProtagonistA's office 
 ProtagonistA called the authorities and they took ProtagonistB into their care 
 ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA denied it , of course , but no one believed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a few years younger than ProtagonistB , but the two girls quickly became friends 
 ProtagonistA immediately fell in love with it and begged ProtagonistB to buy it for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to wear ProtagonistA's new dress that ProtagonistA put it on right away 
 However , when ProtagonistA went to show ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA realized that the dress was too big for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did as ProtagonistA was told , and when ProtagonistC , led ProtagonistC's people out of Egypt , ProtagonistA was among them 
 ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistC to the Promised Land , where ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's people live happily to this day 
ProtagonistA had always been a headstrong girl , and when ProtagonistA fell in love with ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA's family was less than thrilled 
 In the end , ProtagonistA got ProtagonistA's way and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were married 
ProtagonistA had been holding ProtagonistA's tongue for far too long 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being the doormat , the one who always said yes and never complained 
 Today , ProtagonistA was going to speak ProtagonistA's mind 
 ProtagonistA started with ProtagonistB 
 For months , ProtagonistA had been working on a project that was very important to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB kept putting it on the back burner 
 Today , ProtagonistA went into ProtagonistB's office and told ProtagonistB exactly how ProtagonistA felt 
 Next , ProtagonistA tackled ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA sat ProtagonistC down and calmly explained how ProtagonistA's mess was affecting ProtagonistA 
 Finally , ProtagonistA took on ProtagonistA's parents 
 ProtagonistA had always been a good daughter , but ProtagonistA was tired of being treated like a child 
 ProtagonistA sat them down and told them that ProtagonistA was an adult and deserved to be treated as such 
 ProtagonistA 's a big - shot warlord in the Middle East , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of money , and ProtagonistA 's got some big guns , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of bombs , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of guns 
 But ProtagonistA 's not the only one 
ProtagonistA was walking through the narrow streets of Copenhagen , carefully avoiding the worst of the traffic 
 ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way to the market to buy some bread and cheese for dinner 
 As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA , also avoiding the traffic 
 ProtagonistA felt a sudden jolt of electricity when their eyes met , and ProtagonistA quickly looked away 
 ProtagonistA hurried to the market , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
 ProtagonistA had never felt that way before , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA bought ProtagonistA's bread and cheese and hurried home , ProtagonistA's mind racing 
ProtagonistA went into the water and sat there , a pale - faced man , taking in the ship before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so beautiful , ProtagonistB thought , even in the darkness 
There was once a boy with a very big , very round face and very large eyes and a very small head , but who was much more important than the rest of the boys in the school , and who had played a very important part in ProtagonistB's life , and whose name was William ; and ProtagonistA was a very good , well - behaved boy , and of a very good family , and in a very good school , and was a very useful and useful growth 
 ProtagonistA had been one of ProtagonistB's best friends when they were both little , and ProtagonistA had always been there for ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB needed someone 
 ProtagonistA was the one who had helped ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB was lost in the forest , and ProtagonistA had been the one to comfort ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB was upset 
 ProtagonistA was always there for ProtagonistB , no matter what 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistA disappeared 
 One day , out of the blue , ProtagonistA reappeared 
 ProtagonistA had been away for years , and ProtagonistA had changed 
 ProtagonistA was no longer the same boy that ProtagonistB had known 
 ProtagonistA was taller , and ProtagonistA's face was thinner 
 ProtagonistA looked like a completely different person 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had been travelling the world , and that ProtagonistA had seen and done many amazing things 
 Even though ProtagonistA was different , ProtagonistA was still the same old friend that ProtagonistB had always known 
ProtagonistA was making tea for the family when ProtagonistA was startled to discover that ProtagonistB had gone into labour 
 ProtagonistA quickly called for an ambulance and ProtagonistB was rushed to the hospital 
 ProtagonistA was by ProtagonistB's side the whole time , holding ProtagonistB's hand and telling ProtagonistB everything would be alright 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were so grateful , and they knew that this little girl would change their lives forever 
There was once ProtagonistA ; and when ProtagonistA was six , and having already grown into a handsome and somewhat charming boy , and making ProtagonistA happy and prosperous by the exert , ProtagonistA was very much admired by ProtagonistA's friends and acquaintances 
 One day , while out walking with ProtagonistA's father , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was unlike any woman ProtagonistB had ever seen 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistB was charming and persistent 
 ProtagonistA laughed and danced , and ProtagonistA forgot all about ProtagonistA's troubles 
 For the first time in a long time , ProtagonistA felt truly happy 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA agreed 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to leave this magical place , and ProtagonistA did n't want to leave ProtagonistB 
 So ProtagonistA stayed with ProtagonistB , and they sailed away together to a new life 
ProtagonistA had been using ProtagonistA's hearing to the full when ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been eavesdropping on ProtagonistB's conversations for weeks , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was planning to kill ProtagonistA's mother 
 ProtagonistA could n't let that happen , so ProtagonistA took matters into ProtagonistA's own hands 
 ProtagonistA waited until ProtagonistB was in the shower , and ProtagonistA snuck up behind ProtagonistB with a knife 
 ProtagonistA stabbed ProtagonistB in the back , and ProtagonistB died instantly 
 ProtagonistA's mother was safe , and ProtagonistA was free 
 ProtagonistA loved the way they could transport you to another world , or teach you something new about the one you already lived in 
 ProtagonistA had read countless books and seen countless movies , but it was n't until ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA truly understood the power of stories 
 ProtagonistA started to see the potential for magic and wonder in everyday life 
 ProtagonistA began to tell ProtagonistA's own stories , and ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA had a gift for it 
 ProtagonistA continued to learn from ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA pass on ProtagonistA's knowledge to others 
 ProtagonistA helped people see the beauty and potential in their own lives , and ProtagonistA inspired them to tell their own stories 
 ProtagonistA had a great life , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like there was something more out there 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to go on a journey to find out what that something was 
 ProtagonistA traveled for a long time , but ProtagonistA never found what ProtagonistA was looking for 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA was never going to find what ProtagonistA was looking for and ProtagonistA turned back around 
 As ProtagonistA was walking back , ProtagonistA saw a rabbit running by and ProtagonistA followed it 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a strange place 
 ProtagonistA saw the rabbit and started to follow it again 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA was looking for something more 
 ProtagonistA thought about this and ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was looking for love 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA went back home 
 ProtagonistA was finally able to find what ProtagonistA was missing and ProtagonistA was happy 
The night ProtagonistA was arrested , ProtagonistA awoke to find ProtagonistA in a cell with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was just as scared as ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head 
  ProtagonistA do n't know 
 ProtagonistA was just sitting in ProtagonistA's apartment when the police came and took ProtagonistA away 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB continued to talk throughout the night , sharing their stories and their fears 
ProtagonistA had never known the heart of a woman , and ProtagonistA did not even pretend to be surprised at ProtagonistB's romance 
 ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little jealous 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to experience the kind of love that ProtagonistB was now enjoying , but it just seemed to elude ProtagonistA 
 Maybe one day , ProtagonistA thought 
 Maybe one day ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistA's own romance 
 But for now , ProtagonistA was content to be ProtagonistB's friend and confidante , and to share in ProtagonistB's happiness 
ProtagonistA approached the throne upon an armchair not as a king , but as a dandy 
 ProtagonistA was a success , but no more than a short - cut , with ProtagonistB at full term 
 ProtagonistA sat down to lunch , and took a stool in the sofas on the other side of the table 
   ProtagonistA am who ProtagonistA am ,  ProtagonistA said with a shrug 
  And what is it that ProtagonistA want , ProtagonistA ?   ProtagonistA want ProtagonistB to sign this treaty ,  ProtagonistA said , pulling a document out of ProtagonistA's pocket and sliding it across the table 
  ProtagonistA 're very straightforward , are n't ProtagonistA ?   ProtagonistA try to be ,  ProtagonistA said 
  Now , what was it ProtagonistA wanted to ask ProtagonistB ?   Oh , nothing ,  ProtagonistA said , getting to ProtagonistA's feet 
  ProtagonistA just wanted to make sure ProtagonistB were still alive 
 ProtagonistA 'll be on ProtagonistA's way now 
ProtagonistA was only six years old when ProtagonistB left for the first time 
 All ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistB was going to be gone for a while and ProtagonistA would have to stay with ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA would often cry ProtagonistA to sleep at night , wondering where ProtagonistB was and if ProtagonistB was ever coming back 
 ProtagonistA would see other families out and about , playing in the snow and having snowball fights , and ProtagonistA would feel so alone 
 From then on , ProtagonistA started to feel a bit better 
 ProtagonistA still missed ProtagonistB terribly but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was doing something important 
 The next winter , ProtagonistA was excited to see ProtagonistB again and give ProtagonistB a big hug 
ProtagonistA did n't share a room with your mom or ProtagonistB or any of that stuff that everybody does 
 ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's own room , and ProtagonistA loved it 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA did n't have ProtagonistA's own space anymore 
 ProtagonistA had to share a room with ProtagonistB , and it was awful 
 But ProtagonistA did n't give up 
 ProtagonistA kept fighting for ProtagonistA's own space , and eventually , ProtagonistA won 
 ProtagonistA got ProtagonistA's own room back , and ProtagonistA was happier than ever 
ProtagonistA lay in ProtagonistA's white cotton dress , looking out through the bars at the stars overhead , and ProtagonistB ; and all the life of the world was passing before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been in prison for so long , ProtagonistA could not remember how it had happened 
 ProtagonistA only knew that ProtagonistA was innocent , and that no one would believe ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had given up hope of ever getting out , until one day , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA's cell 
 As ProtagonistA lay on the ground , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing over ProtagonistA , weeping 
 ProtagonistA forgave ProtagonistB , and died with a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
ProtagonistA had been walking in the forest for hours , and ProtagonistA was starting to get tired 
 ProtagonistA had been following ProtagonistB , hoping that ProtagonistB would lead ProtagonistA back home 
 ProtagonistA sat down on a log to rest , and ProtagonistA soon fell asleep 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistA got up and started walking around , trying to find ProtagonistA's way out of the forest 
 But ProtagonistA only got more and more lost 
 ProtagonistA started to cry , and ProtagonistA sat down on the ground , feeling hopeless 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA looked up and saw ProtagonistB , standing at the edge of the forest 
 ProtagonistA was so grateful to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA hugged ProtagonistB and thanked ProtagonistB for finding ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA vowed to never go into the forest again , and ProtagonistA never did 
ProtagonistA was having a tough day 
 ProtagonistA had been up since the sun rose , and now it was well past noon 
 ProtagonistA was exhausted , and all ProtagonistA wanted to do was take a nap 
 But ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 ProtagonistA had responsibilities 
 ProtagonistA had to take care of the animals 
 ProtagonistA trudged through the barn , doing ProtagonistA best to take care of the animals 
 But ProtagonistA was so tired , ProtagonistA could barely keep ProtagonistA's eyes open 
 Finally , ProtagonistA made it to the cooler 
 ProtagonistA lay down on the floor , propping ProtagonistB's ears up and putting ProtagonistB's hooves on ProtagonistB's head 
 ProtagonistA was just going to rest for a few minutes 
 ProtagonistA was n't going to fall asleep 
 But ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA sat up , wide - eyed , as ProtagonistA saw a figure silhouetted in the doorway 
 Who 's there ?  ProtagonistA called out , ProtagonistA's voice shaking 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 Then , ProtagonistA heard a voice 
 ProtagonistA , it 's ProtagonistB ,  the voice said 
 ProtagonistA relaxed 
 ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB scared ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA smiled 
 ProtagonistA appreciate it 
 ProtagonistA was just taking a quick nap 
 ProtagonistA lay down and closed ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA was safe now 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would always be there to look out for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's own set of sparrow feet 
 ProtagonistA loved them and was always excited to show them off 
 One day , ProtagonistA was playing in ProtagonistA's backyard when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking by 
 ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB and asked if ProtagonistB wanted to see ProtagonistA's feet 
ProtagonistA was having a wonderful time at the palace 
 ProtagonistA loved spending time with ProtagonistB 
 But one day , ProtagonistA discovered that ProtagonistB had tried to kill ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was scared to confront ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to 
 ProtagonistA forgave ProtagonistB and they remained close cousins 
ProtagonistA was sitting cross - legged on the edge of the porch , ProtagonistA's eyes fixed on the tree closest to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt at peace with the world 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB , standing there 
  Yes ?  ProtagonistA said 
 Oh , just about life in general ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA stared at the floor , ProtagonistA's eyes darting from one simple idea to another 
 ProtagonistA was trying to think of a way to get out of the situation ProtagonistA was in , but nothing was coming to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been in this room for hours , with no food or water , and ProtagonistA was starting to get desperate 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a key in the door and ProtagonistA quickly stood up , hoping that someone had come to rescue ProtagonistA 
 But when the door opened , ProtagonistA saw that it was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart sink as ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was going to die in this room 
 ProtagonistA tried to think of something , anything , that could help ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was coming up blank 
 ProtagonistA struggled to breathe , ProtagonistA's eyes wide with fear 
 ProtagonistA knew that this was the end , and there was nothing ProtagonistA could do to stop it 
 ProtagonistA had just moved in the week before , and was still getting used to the sound of the rain on the roof 
 ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's chair , looking out the window at the rain , when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking down the street 
 ProtagonistA could n't tell who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistB seemed to be coming towards ProtagonistA's house 
 As ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was a woman , and ProtagonistB was carrying a suitcase 
 ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA's new neighbor 
ProtagonistA had been having trouble sleeping for weeks 
 ProtagonistA would lie in bed for hours , tossing and turning , trying to will ProtagonistA to fall asleep 
 But as soon as ProtagonistA would start to drift off , ProtagonistA's mind would start racing and ProtagonistA would be wide awake again 
 ProtagonistA had been lying in bed for hours , staring at the ceiling , when ProtagonistA noticed that the moon had stopped shining 
 ProtagonistA found this odd , but not entirely unexpected 
 After all , ProtagonistA had been having trouble sleeping for weeks 
 ProtagonistA tried to go back to sleep , but ProtagonistA's mind was now racing even more than before 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to the window to see if the moon was still there 
 ProtagonistA looked around , but there was no sign of it anywhere 
 ProtagonistA was about to go back to bed when ProtagonistA heard a noise outside 
 ProtagonistA looked out the window and saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA's house 
 ProtagonistA was about to call out to ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA noticed that ProtagonistB was carrying a large sack 
 ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB walked up to ProtagonistA's house and disappeared inside 
 ProtagonistA was about to go downstairs to see what was going on when ProtagonistA heard a voice 
 ProtagonistA did n't have the moon 
  ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was about to give ProtagonistB the moon when ProtagonistA heard a noise from upstairs 
 ProtagonistA ran upstairs to see what the noise was 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's cat , Mr
 ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief and went back to bed 
 But ProtagonistA could n't sleep 
 ProtagonistA was too confused about what had just happened 
 Had ProtagonistA really seen the moon disappear ? And who was ProtagonistB ? ProtagonistA would find out soon enough 
 ProtagonistA tried to help ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't get ProtagonistB to stop spinning 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA stayed by ProtagonistB's side for a long time , until finally ProtagonistA had to go on without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA always remembered the day ProtagonistB died 
One day , while watching ProtagonistA's blank expression as it was reflected in a mirror , ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA quite liked it quite a bit 
 How was ProtagonistA going to wear it without looking like an idiot ! ProtagonistA decided to try it out on ProtagonistA's next date with ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA could tell ProtagonistB was taken aback by ProtagonistA's appearance 
  ProtagonistA just smiled and said ,  ProtagonistA know , is n't it great ?  ProtagonistB did n't know what to say , so ProtagonistB just smiled and nodded 
 Throughout the date , ProtagonistA could tell ProtagonistB was uncomfortable , but ProtagonistA did n't mind 
 ProtagonistA was having a great time 
  ProtagonistA just laughed and said ,  That 's fine , ProtagonistA 'm not going anywhere 
ProtagonistA swallowed a large melty gulp of ProtagonistA's new favorite drink which was no doubt ProtagonistA's seventh 
 ProtagonistA had been drinking it all day and was feeling a bit buzzed 
 ProtagonistA was sitting on ProtagonistA's porch swing , swaying back and forth , when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking by 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 're looking a bit flushed 
  ProtagonistA 'm fine ,  ProtagonistA replied ,  ProtagonistA just love this new drink 
 ProtagonistA thought about what ProtagonistB said and decided maybe ProtagonistB was right 
 ProtagonistA got up from the swing and went inside to pour ProtagonistA a glass of water 
 But with the support of ProtagonistA's family and friends , ProtagonistA slowly started to heal 
 And although ProtagonistA still misses ProtagonistB every day , ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistB will always be with ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's heart 
ProtagonistA was working at a dress shop when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB working there 
 ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB was cute and ProtagonistA started to talk to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA , through the thickets of underbrush , through the smog , through the deep dark , lay in the dimness of ProtagonistB's chambers , ProtagonistA's head on ProtagonistA's hooves 
 ProtagonistA was tired from ProtagonistA's journey and wanted to rest , but ProtagonistA could not 
 ProtagonistA was too excited to see ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistA had not seen ProtagonistB in years , not since ProtagonistA had left for college 
 ProtagonistA remembered ProtagonistB as a kind and gentle girl , always ready to help others 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would be able to help ProtagonistA now 
 ProtagonistA stood up and began to pace 
 ProtagonistA peered out of the window , trying to see ProtagonistB's house in the distance 
 ProtagonistA could not see it , but ProtagonistA knew it was there 
 ProtagonistA was so close , ProtagonistA could almost feel ProtagonistB's presence 
 ProtagonistA began to trot in place , ProtagonistA's hooves making soft thumping sounds on the floor 
 ProtagonistA was getting impatient 
 Finally , ProtagonistA heard footsteps outside the door 
 ProtagonistA froze , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
 ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB's help ,  ProtagonistA said urgently 
  ProtagonistA do n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was hoping ProtagonistB could help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was worried about ProtagonistC and wanted to help , but ProtagonistA did not know how 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could count on ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA had just finished eating dinner with ProtagonistA's family and was walking down the aisle of the car park of the local church when the first thing ProtagonistA noticed was ProtagonistB looking back at ProtagonistA from the rear window 
 Without thinking any further , ProtagonistA ran over to the car and jumped in 
ProtagonistA had been thinking all day if ProtagonistA 'd ever had the chance to speak to ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up hope when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking down the street 
ProtagonistA had never been a particularly violent person 
 ProtagonistA avoided conflict and preferred to live a peaceful life 
 However , in ProtagonistA's younger and more vulnerable years , ProtagonistA had never held a weapon above ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA thought for sure ProtagonistA was going to die 
 ProtagonistA lifted ProtagonistA's hand and grabbed ProtagonistB's wrist , twisting it until ProtagonistB dropped the knife 
 Then ProtagonistA brought the knife up and stabbed ProtagonistB in the stomach 
 ProtagonistA stood over ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
 ProtagonistA had never felt so alive 
 In that moment , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was capable of so much more than ProtagonistA had ever thought possible 
One morning , as the sun was leaking its last faint rays , ProtagonistA heard the bell ring 
 ProtagonistA was in the kitchen preparing the breakfast ProtagonistA 'd have for ProtagonistA's grandkids for the holidays 
 ProtagonistA was n't looking out of the kitchen window 
 When ProtagonistA heard the bell , ProtagonistA went to the window to see who it was 
 ProtagonistA signed for it and took it inside 
 ProtagonistA opened it and found a box of chocolates 
 ProtagonistA smiled and went back to the kitchen to finish preparing breakfast 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the living room of ProtagonistA's house in the suburbs of Ponyville , the fresh air of ProtagonistA's fresh - pitch garden bringing out blue - green flowers that bloomed all afternoon and remained crisp and green all night 
 The phone beside ProtagonistA's rang , and ProtagonistA picked it up , ProtagonistA's heart already pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
  Hello ?  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's voice trembling 
  Yes ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's knees buckle and ProtagonistA collapsed to the floor , the phone still clutched in ProtagonistA's hand 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
ProtagonistA was riding ProtagonistB down Mount Fouladuddy when it happened 
 ProtagonistA was having a quite a pleasant ride when ProtagonistB suddenly stopped and would not move 
 ProtagonistA tried everything ProtagonistA could think of , but ProtagonistB just would n't budge 
 ProtagonistA was starting to get worried when ProtagonistA heard a voice behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistC 
  Yes ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistC and continued on ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA was amazed at what had just happened and grateful for ProtagonistC's help 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA smiled as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistA's father wash his hands in the sink , then rise to the counter and give ProtagonistB a knowing nod 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA's father approved of ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was glad 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and watched from behind the large , open window of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been following ProtagonistB for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had first seen ProtagonistB at the market 
 ProtagonistA had saved up all ProtagonistA's money and was now ready to make an offer 
 ProtagonistA just had to wait for the right moment 
 ProtagonistA quickly saddled up ProtagonistA's own horse and rode over to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA then led ProtagonistB back to ProtagonistB's stall and made ProtagonistB an offer 
 ProtagonistB was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistA was adamant 
 ProtagonistA promised to take good care of ProtagonistB and even offered to pay more than the asking price 
 ProtagonistA was over the moon 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA now owned ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA vowed to take good care of ProtagonistB and give ProtagonistB the best life possible 
ProtagonistA cast the last of ProtagonistA's net on ProtagonistB's second moon , soaring high above the likeness of an alder - maiden in the deep , silent night 
 ProtagonistA had been tracking ProtagonistB for weeks , and ProtagonistA knew that this was ProtagonistA's opportunity to finally catch ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was a notoriously elusive creature , and ProtagonistA was determined to be the one to capture ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had set ProtagonistA's sights on ProtagonistB's moon and had been patiently waiting for ProtagonistA's chance 
 When ProtagonistB finally appeared , ProtagonistA was ready 
 ProtagonistA cast ProtagonistA's net and waited for ProtagonistB to be ensnared 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the bank , searching for ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA had been playing with them near the river when ProtagonistA got separated 
 ProtagonistA called out their names , but there was no answer 
 ProtagonistA was just about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a voice 
ProtagonistA had taken a rest from ProtagonistA's long and busy life , and now that ProtagonistA was free of the cares of being a wife and mother , ProtagonistA was content to enjoy the moment of happiness which ProtagonistA had prepared for just such an occasion 
 ProtagonistA had a cup of tea and a book , and ProtagonistA was just about to settle in when ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door 
 ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and there was ProtagonistB there , who looked to be about the same age as ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was surprised , but ProtagonistA was also very happy to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's own life 
 ProtagonistA was kind and sweet and always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
ProtagonistA stood in the shadow of ProtagonistA's mother 's dusty glass cabinet , ProtagonistA's hooves hanging down on the peg to keep ProtagonistA right eye steady 
 ProtagonistA was looking at the family portrait that hung on the wall 
 ProtagonistA remembered the day it was taken 
 ProtagonistA felt a tear run down ProtagonistA's cheek , and ProtagonistA quickly wiped it away 
 ProtagonistA did n't want ProtagonistB to see ProtagonistA crying 
ProtagonistA was on the pedestal of ProtagonistB's bed , drooping down and frowning as ProtagonistA stared up at the stars 
 ProtagonistA was too worried about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had tried to talk to ProtagonistB about it , but ProtagonistB just brushed ProtagonistA off 
 ProtagonistA was starting to get worried that something was really wrong 
 When ProtagonistA finally noticed ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA jumped up in surprise 
 Yeah , ProtagonistA could n't sleep either 
 ProtagonistA was just thinking about ProtagonistA 
  Can ProtagonistB hear ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistA asked , desperation in ProtagonistA's voice 
  ProtagonistA put ProtagonistA's head in ProtagonistA's hands and wept 
ProtagonistA sat on the bank and stretched out ProtagonistB's hooves before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was a beautiful horse , and ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's owner 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB very much , and ProtagonistA was very grateful to have ProtagonistB 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was brushing ProtagonistB's coat , ProtagonistA found a grey hair 
 ProtagonistA was shocked , because ProtagonistA had never seen a grey hair on ProtagonistB before 
 ProtagonistA knew that this meant that ProtagonistB was getting old , and ProtagonistA was very sad about it 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's garden , enjoying the last of the twilight 
 ProtagonistA had half - eaten an apple and was idly tossing the core into the bushes when ProtagonistA saw a movement out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB sitting on ProtagonistB's haunches , looking at ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's bright eyes 
 ProtagonistA was startled , but not afraid 
 ProtagonistA simply nodded and held out the apple 
 ProtagonistA had never met a talking rabbit before , and ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA never would again 
 ProtagonistA sat for a long time , thinking about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA fell for the first time in ProtagonistA's life when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA soon realized that ProtagonistB was never going to do anything for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB and was willing to do anything for ProtagonistB 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was only in love with the idea of ProtagonistB and not the reality of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA broke up with ProtagonistB and never looked back 
 ProtagonistA too , ProtagonistB ,  gushed ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's eyes sparkling as ProtagonistA turned the thick chain of grass around ProtagonistA to the side 
  ProtagonistA 'll be careful 
 But even as ProtagonistA said it , ProtagonistA felt something snake around ProtagonistA's leg , tripping ProtagonistA up 
 ProtagonistA yelped in surprise as ProtagonistA fell , and ProtagonistB came galloping over 
 ProtagonistA sat up , and the first thing ProtagonistA saw was the huge , gaping mouth of a snake , ready to strike 
ProtagonistA had been feeling off all day 
 ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that something bad was going to happen 
 So when ProtagonistA was walking to the Reynolds house to fetch a glass of water in the middle of the night and ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the parlor , ProtagonistA knew something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA walked into the room and saw ProtagonistB standing over the body of ProtagonistB's wife with a bloody knife in ProtagonistB's hand 
 ProtagonistA gasped and ProtagonistB turned around , seeing ProtagonistA in the doorway 
 ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB's footsteps pounding after ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was faster 
 ProtagonistA made it to the front door and ran out into the night 
 ProtagonistA ran all the way home and told ProtagonistA's parents what had happened 
ProtagonistA was always sitting on ProtagonistB's lap , looking up at the sky 
 ProtagonistA was never quite sure how old ProtagonistA was , but ProtagonistA always felt younger when ProtagonistA was with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's anchor in the world 
 But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would want ProtagonistA to keep looking up at the sky 
 Every day , ProtagonistA would sit on ProtagonistB's lap , even though ProtagonistB was no longer there 
 And ProtagonistA would look up at the sky , and ProtagonistA would feel ProtagonistB's presence with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a young woman of great beauty , intelligence , and strength of character 
 ProtagonistA was also a woman of great faith , and it was this faith that sustained ProtagonistA through the many trials and tribulations ProtagonistA faced in ProtagonistA's short life 
 When ProtagonistA was sixteen , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA continued to write to ProtagonistC , and they continued to meet in secret 
 ProtagonistA was alone in the world , but ProtagonistA did not despair 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistA was determined to find a way to be with ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA went to the city of Traver , where ProtagonistA found a job as a maid in a wealthy household 
 ProtagonistA worked hard and saved ProtagonistA's money , and finally ProtagonistA had enough to buy a ticket to ProtagonistD 
 When ProtagonistA arrived in ProtagonistD , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was a woman of great courage and strength 
 ProtagonistA faced many challenges in ProtagonistA's life , but ProtagonistA never gave up on ProtagonistA's love for ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA is an inspiration to us all 
 ProtagonistA turned and ran towards the sound , and as ProtagonistA got closer ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB's figure on the horizon 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was finally home 
ProtagonistA was standing on the street with ProtagonistA's back to the house , looking up at the huge dark building which , between ProtagonistA's legs , was partially illuminated by the darkness of the night 
 ProtagonistA was wondering what it would be like to live in a place like that , when ProtagonistA heard a voice behind ProtagonistA 
 Hey , what are ProtagonistA ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistB standing there , looking at ProtagonistA with a mix of confusion and concern 
 I'm just looking at the building ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA shrugged 
  ProtagonistA guess so 
 ProtagonistA nodded 
  ProtagonistB 're right , ProtagonistA should go 
 ProtagonistA turned to walk away , but ProtagonistB stopped ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA nodded 
 As ProtagonistA closed the door , ProtagonistA could n't help but wonder if ProtagonistA would ever see that building again 
ProtagonistA felt so tired ProtagonistA could n't even tell the day 
 All ProtagonistA knew was that it was dark , and ProtagonistA was cold 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for what felt like hours , but ProtagonistA was n't sure 
 ProtagonistA had been exploring the forest with ProtagonistA's friends when they got separated 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for what felt like hours , but ProtagonistA was n't sure 
 ProtagonistA was getting scared 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA saw a light in the distance 
 ProtagonistA walked towards it , and ProtagonistA saw a house 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door , and ProtagonistB answered 
 ProtagonistA was so tired , ProtagonistA fell asleep as soon as ProtagonistA hit the pillow 
 ProtagonistA was safe now , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistA's way home in the morning 
ProtagonistA , had ProtagonistB ; and , though ProtagonistA was only fifty - one , ProtagonistA was already growing very old indeed 
 ProtagonistA walked with a stoop , and ProtagonistA's hands trembled when ProtagonistA spoke 
 One day , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was going to die soon 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA could feel it in ProtagonistA's bones 
 ProtagonistA died a few weeks later , on ProtagonistA's birthday 
 ProtagonistA had been ProtagonistB's only friend , and now ProtagonistA was gone 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day 
 First , ProtagonistA overslept and was late for work 
 ProtagonistA was so frustrated by the time ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA took it out on ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's room , trying to take a nap , when ProtagonistA heard a loud banging on ProtagonistA's door 
 ProtagonistA groaned , got up , and answered it 
ProtagonistB was a very weird little pony , very little -- but through no fault of ProtagonistA's own did ProtagonistA ever know it 
 ProtagonistA tried to ask ProtagonistB about it , but ProtagonistB just shrugged and said ProtagonistB did n't know what they were talking about 
 But ProtagonistA knew better 
 ProtagonistA could see the difference , even if ProtagonistB could n't 
 And ProtagonistA knew that it was something special 
ProtagonistA had been having strange dreams lately 
 ProtagonistA tried to tell ProtagonistA it was nothing , just ProtagonistA's mind playing tricks on ProtagonistA 
 But when ProtagonistA woke up on Saturday morning , ProtagonistA knew something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA could feel it in ProtagonistA's gut 
 ProtagonistA tried to go about ProtagonistA's day as normal , but ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that something was off 
 ProtagonistA could n't focus on anything and ProtagonistA's mind kept wandering 
 By lunchtime , ProtagonistA was certain something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's room and laid down , trying to clear ProtagonistA's head 
 But as soon as ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes , ProtagonistA was back in the dream 
 ProtagonistA was falling , faster and faster 
 ProtagonistA tried to scream , but no sound came out 
 Just as ProtagonistA was about to hit the ground , ProtagonistA woke up 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to tell someone about the dream , but ProtagonistA was scared 
 What if they did n't believe ProtagonistA ? What if they thought ProtagonistA was crazy?In the end , ProtagonistA decided to tell ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could trust ProtagonistB 
 And ProtagonistA was right 
 With the help of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was able to overcome ProtagonistA's fear and get back to sleeping soundly 
ProtagonistA was getting ready for ProtagonistA's date with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA wanted to look perfect 
 ProtagonistA had on a yellow cardigan with a striped T - shirt underneath , a length of dress - length red - blouse and a blouse with a slit at the knee that fell just below the hips , on which ProtagonistA had a pair of high heels 
 ProtagonistA looked in the mirror and was happy with ProtagonistA's outfit 
 ProtagonistA was about to leave when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had forgotten ProtagonistA's purse 
 ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistA's room and got ProtagonistA's purse , then ProtagonistA left 
 When ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistB's house , ProtagonistA was surprised to see that ProtagonistB was dressed similarly to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was only six years old , but ProtagonistA knew that something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was working on a case that was just too difficult 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB was the best detective in the world , and that ProtagonistB would solve the case 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA believed in ProtagonistB , and that ProtagonistB could do it 
 ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was right - ProtagonistB was the best detective in the world 
ProtagonistA had a hobby , one that ProtagonistA thought was amusing 
 ProtagonistA would spend hours upon hours planning and executing pranks on ProtagonistA's unsuspecting friends and family 
 ProtagonistA had planned to put a whoopee cushion on ProtagonistB's chair when ProtagonistB sat down to watch TV , but ProtagonistB caught ProtagonistA in the act and foiled ProtagonistA's plan 
 So , what 's the plan on the diamond market ?  ProtagonistA asked as ProtagonistA gazed out at the street 
  ProtagonistA nodded 
 ProtagonistA was always the patient one 
  ProtagonistA think that 's a good idea ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA think we should wait a few days and see what happens ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA do n't want to make any decisions until we have more information 
ProtagonistA had always spoken highly of the Apple family 
 ProtagonistA was content living in their small town , and ProtagonistA did n't see the need to travel 
 But when ProtagonistA's mother became ill , ProtagonistA knew it was time to take the trip 
 ProtagonistA wanted to see ProtagonistA's mother happy one last time 
 So ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and set off for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was sad when the time came to leave , but ProtagonistA was comforted by the knowledge that ProtagonistA would always have a place in ProtagonistA's heart for ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a young filly who loved to run and play 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was out playing with ProtagonistA's friends , ProtagonistA ran a little too hard and fell , hitting ProtagonistA's head on a rock 
ProtagonistA was in a daze as ProtagonistA wandered through the strange land 
 ProtagonistA had only the vague recollection of having visited this place once before , but ProtagonistA could n't remember when or why 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was walking in a dream 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA came upon a small cottage 
 ProtagonistA hesitantly approached the door and knocked 
 ProtagonistA tried the handle , but it was locked 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up and walk away when ProtagonistA heard a voice from inside the cottage 
 ProtagonistA knew that voice 
 ProtagonistA felt a cold chill run down ProtagonistA's spine 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was n't supposed to be here 
 ProtagonistA had to leave before it was too late 
 You're dead ,  ProtagonistA whispered 
  But ProtagonistA 're here too 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA was scared and confused 
  ProtagonistA do n't belong here anymore 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA nodded 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was right 
 ProtagonistA did n't belong in this place 
 As they walked away , ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's memories of this place fading 
ProtagonistA thundered down the hall of the Palace , ProtagonistA's hooves pounding against the stone walls 
 ProtagonistA had heard that ProtagonistB was a fair and just ruler , and ProtagonistA wanted to show ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was a worthy successor 
 When ProtagonistA reached the throne room , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on ProtagonistB's throne , surrounded by ProtagonistB's courtiers 
 ProtagonistA bowed low and said ,  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA am Alice , daughter of the Duke of Wonderland 
 ProtagonistA have come to offer ProtagonistA's services to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches , staring up at the stars 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could reach out and touch them 
  ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB standing there 
 Um , hi ,  ProtagonistA said , feeling a bit awkward 
 No , ProtagonistA do n't mind ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA thought for a moment 
  ProtagonistA do n't know ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA guess ProtagonistA have n't really thought about it 
 ProtagonistA considered this 
  Maybe ,  ProtagonistA said 
 Yeah , you too ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA felt a bit more hopeful now , believing that maybe there was someone out there looking back at ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been waiting all morning for the important piece of paperwork that was going to give ProtagonistB ProtagonistB's retroactive pardon 
 ProtagonistA had been working on it for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally going to get to see ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA could hardly sit still 
 ProtagonistA could n't wait to see the look on ProtagonistB's face when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was over at the office hours , doing ProtagonistA's best hard - boiled egg - and - coconut dish 
 ProtagonistA had spent hours perfecting the recipe , and it was finally ready 
 ProtagonistA nervously placed the dish in front of ProtagonistB , hoping ProtagonistB would like it 
  This is amazing , ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistA are a fantastic cook 
 ProtagonistA was over the moon 
 ProtagonistA had finally impressed ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's cooking 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would remember ProtagonistA's dish the next time ProtagonistB was looking for a good meal 
One morning , when the sun was bright and the mergansie were jovial , Sunburnt , and the blue - and - white streaked the sky with golden stars and the town of Harmony was bustling with the glee of Times Square , ProtagonistA decided to see ProtagonistB for the first time 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to , but never had the time or money 
 ProtagonistA took a bus to ProtagonistB's house , which was a few hours away 
ProtagonistA was herding the ponies to the barn when ProtagonistB approached 
ProtagonistA came into the kitchen to find ProtagonistB reading a journal 
 What 's up?Nothing much ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 What 's it about ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 Can ProtagonistA read it ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA sat down at the kitchen table and began to read 
 As ProtagonistA read , ProtagonistA could almost feel as if ProtagonistA was there with ProtagonistC , living ProtagonistC's life alongside ProtagonistC 
 When ProtagonistA finished , ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistB with new respect 
 ProtagonistA smiled 
ProtagonistA was just finishing up the last of the cupcakes and had nearly finished ProtagonistA's breakfast when ProtagonistA heard the door open 
 ProtagonistA knew it was ProtagonistB coming home from ProtagonistB's early morning walk 
 ProtagonistA went to greet ProtagonistB with a cupcake in hand 
  ProtagonistA 're up early 
  ProtagonistA made ProtagonistB a cupcake 
 ProtagonistA had been a single mother for six years , and had done quite well for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was starting to feel lonely 
 ProtagonistA had thought about going back to ProtagonistA's family home , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if they would accept ProtagonistA back , or if they would even want ProtagonistA's daughter there 
 ProtagonistA had also thought about marrying a man , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA was ready for that either 
 As ProtagonistA was walking and thinking , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA stopped and stared at ProtagonistB for a moment , and then ProtagonistA smiled 
 ProtagonistA knew then that ProtagonistA was ready to marry ProtagonistB , and that ProtagonistA would never be alone again 
 ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB how to use ProtagonistA's powers to make the earth freeze and then showed ProtagonistB how to use ProtagonistA's powers to make it thaw 
ProtagonistA was on trial for murder 
 ProtagonistA had killed ProtagonistB after ProtagonistB had cheated on ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's best friend 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistC that ProtagonistA had come home and found ProtagonistB in bed with ProtagonistA's best friend 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had gone into the kitchen and grabbed a knife 
 ProtagonistA then went back into the bedroom and stabbed ProtagonistB to death 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistD that ProtagonistA had found a recipe for a poisonous cake on ProtagonistB's computer 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had baked the cake and put it on ProtagonistB's nightstand 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would eat it and that it would kill ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked at a blank horizon 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , ever since ProtagonistA had been forced to leave ProtagonistA's home 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , or what ProtagonistA would find when ProtagonistA got there 
 All ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistA had to keep moving 
 ProtagonistA had been rationing ProtagonistA's water , but ProtagonistA was almost out 
 ProtagonistA was about to get up and keep walking when ProtagonistA heard a sound in the distance 
 ProtagonistA quickly hid behind a nearby bush and waited 
 ProtagonistA could hear the sound of footsteps getting closer and closer 
 ProtagonistA was about to call out to ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA saw the look on ProtagonistB's face 
 ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistB was being chased by someone 
 ProtagonistA waited until ProtagonistB was closer , and then ProtagonistA jumped out and grabbed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA pulled ProtagonistB behind the bush and waited 
 Soon , ProtagonistA could hear the sound of someone else coming 
 ProtagonistA peeked out from behind the bush and saw two men 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do something 
 ProtagonistA jumped out from behind the bush and yelled at the men to stop 
 ProtagonistA used that moment to ProtagonistA's advantage 
 ProtagonistA ran towards the men and tackled one of them to the ground 
 ProtagonistA knocked the gun out of ProtagonistC's hand and punched ProtagonistC in the face 
 ProtagonistA grabbed ProtagonistB and started to run 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get away from those men 
ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistA's eyes peeled for anything out of the ordinary , but ProtagonistA was doing ProtagonistA best to ignore the odd look the look of interest was giving ProtagonistA 
 It was clear that ProtagonistB was interested in ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA was interested in ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to give ProtagonistB the wrong impression , so ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to avoid eye contact 
ProtagonistA stood up and trotted across the grass , trotted down a short flight of steps and to the door of the cottage ProtagonistA had recently moved into 
 ProtagonistA pushed the door open a bit further and peeked inside 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , so ProtagonistA just stood there and watched 
 ProtagonistA felt bad for ProtagonistB , so ProtagonistA walked into the cottage and went over to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA helped ProtagonistB up and sat ProtagonistB down in a chair 
 ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistB's name was Sarah , and ProtagonistB had just moved into the cottage too 
 ProtagonistA comforted ProtagonistB and told ProtagonistB that everything would be alright 
 ProtagonistA went home , thinking about what had happened 
 ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had been there to help ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA vowed to always be a good friend to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had been married to ProtagonistC for several weeks when ProtagonistA heard that ProtagonistB was expecting a baby 
 ProtagonistA was overjoyed for ProtagonistB and could n't wait to meet the new addition to the family 
 However , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little jealous 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC had been trying to conceive for a while now without any luck 
 ProtagonistA knew that it was n't ProtagonistB's fault , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel envious 
 Still , ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB and was excited to be an aunt 
 ProtagonistA was determined to help ProtagonistB in any way ProtagonistA could , and ProtagonistA knew that the baby would bring them all even closer together 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day 
 First , ProtagonistA woke up late and had to rush to get ready for ProtagonistA's day 
 Then , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had forgotten to do ProtagonistA's homework the night before 
 When ProtagonistA got to school , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's lunch at home 
 ProtagonistA was feeling really down by the time lunch period came around 
 ProtagonistA sat down on the ground , ProtagonistA's tail turning to one side and ProtagonistA's eyes closed , and tried to forget about ProtagonistA's troubles 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt something soft and warm nudge ProtagonistA's arm 
 ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes to see ProtagonistB sitting next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was grateful to ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's support and friendship 
 ProtagonistA knew that no matter what , ProtagonistB would always be there for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA should n't have been playing with the gun , but it was so tempting 
It 's all right , ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA said so sweetly , that ProtagonistA's hooves shook the paper as ProtagonistA said it 
 ProtagonistB was so scared when ProtagonistB saw the big , mean dog , but ProtagonistA was there to protect ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 's always there for ProtagonistB , just like ProtagonistB's mom 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's bedroom , writing a letter to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was telling ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's day and how ProtagonistA had made a new friend at school 
 ProtagonistA was excited to tell ProtagonistB all about ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA hoped that ProtagonistB would be able to come and visit soon 
ProtagonistA had been meaning to write to ProtagonistB for a long time , but ProtagonistA was beginning to get tired of waiting 
 ProtagonistA had so much to say to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB dearly 
 Finally , ProtagonistA decided to take matters into ProtagonistA's own hands and write the letter ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA hope this letter finds ProtagonistB well 
 ProtagonistA miss ProtagonistB a lot , and ProtagonistA hope we can catch up soon 
 ProtagonistA was very lonely and felt like ProtagonistA had lost everything 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was finally able to have the wedding ProtagonistA always wanted , and ProtagonistA was very happy 
ProtagonistA had just gotten off work when ProtagonistA was kidnapped by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB breathing heavily in the darkness 
 ProtagonistA tried to scream , but ProtagonistB covered ProtagonistA's mouth with ProtagonistB's hand 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistB was going to do to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA hoped that they would be okay 
 At least ProtagonistA said so as ProtagonistA rested ProtagonistA's hoof on the end of ProtagonistB's hoof 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was worried and ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to try and comfort ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that it was n't easy to be in ProtagonistB's position 
 But ProtagonistA was there for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA would support ProtagonistB no matter what happened 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA knew everything , and yet there was much ProtagonistA knew nothing about 
 ProtagonistA was always the top of ProtagonistA's class , the teacher 's favorite , and ProtagonistA had never been challenged 
 Over time , ProtagonistA learned more and more from ProtagonistB and realized that there was a whole world of knowledge out there that ProtagonistA had never even imagined 
 ProtagonistA was no longer the smartest person in the room , but ProtagonistA was okay with that because ProtagonistA was learning so much 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's rock and blinked ProtagonistA's eyes , wondering how to get back to reality 
 ProtagonistA had been in this strange place for what felt like days , and ProtagonistA was starting to get worried 
 ProtagonistA had tried everything ProtagonistA could think of to get back home , but nothing had worked 
 ProtagonistA was just about to give up when ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistB seemed to know ProtagonistA 
 Where are we ? What is this place ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA was still confused , but ProtagonistA was also starting to feel hopeful 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's hand and followed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had nothing to lose at this point 
 ProtagonistA hesitated again , but then ProtagonistA took a deep breath and stepped through 
 When ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA back in ProtagonistA's own bedroom 
 ProtagonistA blinked ProtagonistA's eyes , wondering if it was all just a dream 
 But then ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing next to ProtagonistA , looking just as surprised as ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA was really back in reality 
 Thank ProtagonistB so much for finding ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA 're the one who found the way out 
  It 's a picture of ProtagonistA's family ,  ProtagonistA replied 
   ProtagonistB can , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
The day ProtagonistB first met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was four and a half years old 
 ProtagonistA was a little girl with blonde hair and blue eyes 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a pink dress and ProtagonistA had a doll in ProtagonistA's hand 
 ProtagonistA was the most beautiful thing ProtagonistB had ever seen 
 What 's ProtagonistA's name ?  ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's big blue eyes and said ,  ProtagonistA's name is Alice 
 Do ProtagonistA want to be friends ?  ProtagonistA nodded ProtagonistA's head and held out ProtagonistA's hand 
 ProtagonistA were friends from that day forward 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was brushing ProtagonistB's hair as the sun rose over the sky 
 ProtagonistA smiled as ProtagonistA worked , thinking of the days when ProtagonistA would go for rides with ProtagonistA's father on his horse 
 Now , ProtagonistA was a grown woman with responsibilities 
 But ProtagonistA still loved spending time with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had been living in the land for many years , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB had been a force in its history 
 ProtagonistA remembered the stories that ProtagonistB had told ProtagonistA about the land and its people 
 ProtagonistA also remembered the times when ProtagonistB had helped ProtagonistA to understand the land and its ways 
 Even though ProtagonistB had passed away a few years before , ProtagonistA had not forgotten ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA pranced through the air , bouncing on ProtagonistA's wings , ProtagonistA's hooves floating in the swirling air 
 ProtagonistA felt weightless and free , like ProtagonistA could fly forever 
 ProtagonistA laughed and somersaulted in the air , enjoying the sensation of the wind rushing through ProtagonistA's fur 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a loud boom and felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's side 
 ProtagonistA looked down and saw an arrow protruding from ProtagonistA's body 
 ProtagonistA tried to fly away , but ProtagonistA's wings would no longer move 
 ProtagonistA plummeted to the ground , the arrow still embedded in ProtagonistA's side 
 As ProtagonistA lay there , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt the life draining out of ProtagonistA's body as ProtagonistA lay there , helpless 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could have flown away and escaped ProtagonistA's fate , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about the events of the past few days and how everything had changed so quickly 
 But now , ProtagonistA was on the run from the law , and ProtagonistA had no idea what the future held 
 ProtagonistA was tired , and ProtagonistA just wanted to rest , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving 
 ProtagonistA had to find a way to clear ProtagonistA's name and find out who was really behind all of this 
 As ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistA's cabin , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing in the shadows 
 ProtagonistA tensed up , but ProtagonistA did n't make a sound 
  ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB 've been looking for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a dreamer 
 ProtagonistA was always off on some new adventure , never content to stay in one place for very long 
 Alice , my dear , we 're going to live in a storybook !  ProtagonistA exclaimed 
 ProtagonistB was sure ProtagonistA must be joking , but it was soon clear that ProtagonistA was serious 
 ProtagonistA had found an old house in the woods that was said to be the home of ProtagonistC 
 After all , it 's just a story ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day 
 First , ProtagonistA got a bad grade on ProtagonistA's math test 
 To top it all off , ProtagonistA found out ProtagonistC had been hit by a car 
 ProtagonistA was so upset , ProtagonistA threw down ProtagonistA's chair and leaned forward in the air 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA's whole world was falling apart 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice 
 ProtagonistA snapped into action and took ProtagonistC to the vet 
 ProtagonistA felt relieved 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible time remembering what ProtagonistA had done that morning 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had gotten out of bed and eaten breakfast , but after that , ProtagonistA's mind was a total blank 
 ProtagonistA racked ProtagonistA's brain , trying to think of anything that could help ProtagonistA remember , but it was all for naught 
 Finally , ProtagonistA gave up and decided to ask ProtagonistB , if ProtagonistB could help 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA suddenly remembered something 
 Oh , that 's right ! ProtagonistA went to the store this morning 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's help and went on with ProtagonistA's day 
 However , ProtagonistA quickly rose in the ranks , due to ProtagonistA's great magical abilities 
 ProtagonistA became a key figure in the kingdom , stabilizing it and making it far more prosperous 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends were fighting as best they could , but they were quickly being overwhelmed 
 Just when it looked like they were about to be defeated , ProtagonistA summoned a powerful magical blast that took out all of the bandits 
 ProtagonistA continued to use ProtagonistA's magic to help ProtagonistA's kingdom , and ProtagonistA soon became one of the most powerful and respected leaders in all of Equestria 
ProtagonistA turned at the last minute to see ProtagonistB sitting on the bank watching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA waved , but ProtagonistB just sat there 
 ProtagonistA turned back to the river and continued to paddle ProtagonistA's canoe 
 ProtagonistA had been paddling for hours and was getting tired 
 ProtagonistA looked back at ProtagonistB again , but this time ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistA sighed and paddled on 
ProtagonistA stood there , still wearing ProtagonistA's royal blue dress 
 ProtagonistA had been so sure that ProtagonistB had loved ProtagonistA , that ProtagonistB had wanted to marry ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been so naïve 
 ProtagonistA felt the tears welling up in ProtagonistA's eyes , but ProtagonistA refused to give ProtagonistB the satisfaction of seeing ProtagonistA's cry 
 ProtagonistA would never let anyone take advantage of ProtagonistA like that again 
 ProtagonistA sighed and shook ProtagonistA's head 
  ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistB 're right ,  ProtagonistA said 
  Because ProtagonistA really do n't want to end up like poor old Mrs
 With that , ProtagonistA took a deep breath and stepped into the cart 
 However , as they neared the bottom of the hill , ProtagonistA saw something that made ProtagonistA's heart stop 
 ProtagonistB , look out !  ProtagonistA shouted 
 ProtagonistA hit the ground with a thud and lay there , motionless 
 But ProtagonistA did n't respond 
 ProtagonistA was unconscious , and ProtagonistA had no idea what was going to happen to ProtagonistA next 
 ProtagonistA started the car and began to drive away when they saw the first of the hearers - ProtagonistB running down the street with ProtagonistB's hair flying behind ProtagonistB in the wind 
 ProtagonistA quickly turned the car around and drove back to their house 
 ProtagonistA has been this way for hours , ever since ProtagonistA was first placed in the room 
 ProtagonistA was starting to go stir - crazy 
 Finally , ProtagonistA heard the door unlock and ProtagonistB entered the room 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA just stared at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA could trust ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA still did n't say anything 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA finally found ProtagonistA's voice 
  What do ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA to do ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA thought for a moment before ProtagonistA finally nodded ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what else to do 
 ProtagonistA had to trust ProtagonistB if ProtagonistA wanted to get out of there 
 ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA did n't want to stay in that room any longer 
 ProtagonistA did everything ProtagonistB asked and finally , ProtagonistA was free 
 ProtagonistA was finally free 
ProtagonistA stood there , ProtagonistA's hooves resting on the ground 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful horse , with a long mane and tail 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that something was wrong , but ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA just stood there and let ProtagonistB cry 
ProtagonistA was in a great mood today 
 ProtagonistA was whistling as ProtagonistA went about ProtagonistA's work , and ProtagonistA could n't stop smiling 
 It was a beautiful day outside , and ProtagonistA was surrounded by the people ProtagonistA loved most 
 What 's wrong , ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked , still smiling despite the sudden change in atmosphere 
 ProtagonistA knew how much ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistB's cupcakes 
  ProtagonistA can make ProtagonistB another one 
 ProtagonistA tried to console ProtagonistB , but it was no use 
ProtagonistA was at the dinner party , waiting for ProtagonistB , to apologize for not coming sooner 
 ProtagonistA was getting impatient , as the minutes ticked by and ProtagonistB still had n't shown up 
 Finally , ProtagonistA decided to go looking for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA searched the castle from top to bottom , but there was no sign of ProtagonistB anywhere 
 ProtagonistA was just about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the dungeon 
 ProtagonistA cautiously made ProtagonistA's way down , and sure enough , there was ProtagonistB , locked in a ProtagonistA was shocked 
 ProtagonistA had no idea what ProtagonistB had done to deserve this treatment 
 But ProtagonistA was determined to get ProtagonistB out 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistC and demanded the key to the cell 
 ProtagonistA rushed to ProtagonistB's side and embraced ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was beginning to get quite worn out , though ProtagonistA had n't intended for ProtagonistA's obsession to get out of control 
 ProtagonistA had just wanted to try one of those new cupcake places that had opened up down the street 
 But then ProtagonistA had gotten a taste of the creamy frosting and ProtagonistA was hooked 
 Before ProtagonistA knew it , ProtagonistA was making daily trips to the cupcake shop , and then ProtagonistA started buying them in bulk 
 ProtagonistA even started making ProtagonistA's own cupcakes at home 
 But now , ProtagonistA had run out of both money and cupcakes 
 ProtagonistA was desperate 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's friends and family were getting worried about ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA just could n't help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA needed those cupcakes 
 So , ProtagonistA hatched a plan 
 ProtagonistA would break into the cupcake shop in the middle of the night and steal some cupcakes 
 But when ProtagonistA got to the shop , ProtagonistA found that the door was locked 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up and go home when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the back of the shop 
 ProtagonistA cautiously made ProtagonistA's way towards the sound and found a door that was slightly ajar 
 ProtagonistA peeked inside and saw ProtagonistB , putting away some cupcakes 
 ProtagonistA quickly ducked back out of sight and waited for ProtagonistB to leave 
 Once ProtagonistB was gone , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way into the shop and grabbed a few cupcakes 
 ProtagonistA was about to leave when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB coming back 
 ProtagonistA hid under the counter , praying that ProtagonistB would n't find ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 're coming with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA tried to think of a good lie , but ProtagonistA was so tired and stressed from ProtagonistA's addiction that ProtagonistA could n't come up with anything 
 So , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB the truth 
  ProtagonistA 'm addicted to ProtagonistB's cupcakes ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA just ca n't help ProtagonistA 
  But ProtagonistA ca n't just steal from ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA just could n't help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was addicted to those cupcakes 
 And ProtagonistA would do anything to get ProtagonistA's fix 
ProtagonistA had been looking forward to this train ride for months 
 ProtagonistA was finally going to meet ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was excited to finally meet ProtagonistB and see what ProtagonistB was like 
 As ProtagonistA boarded the train , ProtagonistA looked around for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA expected to see an elderly , dainty man sitting beside ProtagonistA 
 Instead , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC sitting in the seat next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA was excited to start ProtagonistA's new life with ProtagonistB 
  But ProtagonistA was never in a hurry 
 ProtagonistA liked to take ProtagonistA's time and smell the roses , as ProtagonistC always said 
  And ProtagonistA would follow ProtagonistB , Hurrying to keep up 
 ProtagonistA quickly scrambled down the bank and ran towards the sound 
 ProtagonistA could see a crowd of people gathered around something in the middle of the street 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA pushed ProtagonistA's way through the crowd and knelt down next to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was still breathing , but ProtagonistB was unconscious 
 ProtagonistA took off ProtagonistA's scarf and tied it tightly around ProtagonistB's arm to stop the bleeding 
 Then ProtagonistA turned to the crowd and shouted for someone to call an ambulance 
ProtagonistA had taken to riding into ProtagonistA's house on ProtagonistA's pink saddle hoof , noting the rows of fifth - story windows that led from ProtagonistA's backyard down into the city 
 ProtagonistA would trot down the street , ProtagonistA's pink saddle and hooves shining in the sun , and people would stop and stare 
 ProtagonistA loved the attention , but ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistC even more 
 ProtagonistC was the one who had brought ProtagonistA this far in life , and ProtagonistA was grateful for every moment they spent together 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistC and did n't want to disobey ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistA also loved ProtagonistB 
 After much thought , ProtagonistA decided to elope with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew it would make ProtagonistC angry , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA was going to marry ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was lying on ProtagonistA back in the grass , looking up at the stars 
 ProtagonistA felt someone tilt ProtagonistA back , and ProtagonistA looked up to see ProtagonistB standing over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA took it and looked through it , gasping at the sight of the stars up close 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and lay back down , staring up at the stars again 
 ProtagonistA felt at peace , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget this night 
ProtagonistA stood in the dim light of the distance , ProtagonistA face downcast and blue eyes fixed on the ground below 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had received the news 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to expect , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was a lamp 
 And then ProtagonistA saw the house 
 ProtagonistA walked up to the door and knocked 
 ProtagonistA heard footsteps inside , and then the door opened 
 ProtagonistA smiled and stepped inside 
  ProtagonistA 'm home ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'm finally home 
ProtagonistA , took a moment to admire the view 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was on top of the world 
 ProtagonistA was about to head back inside when ProtagonistA saw something out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye 
 It was a rainbow ! ProtagonistA had never seen one in real life before 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA started to run towards it 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that the rainbow was actually a bridge 
 And on the other side of the bridge was a castle ! ProtagonistA had never seen anything so beautiful in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was about to cross the bridge when ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name 
 I'm going to cross this bridge and explore that castle ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 That 's why ProtagonistA 'm going to find out ,  ProtagonistA said 
 And with that , ProtagonistA started to cross the bridge 
 ProtagonistA was always so perfect and put - together , and ProtagonistB was a bit of a mess 
 But then ProtagonistA did something unexpected 
 ProtagonistA reached out and touched ProtagonistB's cheek , wiping away a stray tear 
  It 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA , sat at ProtagonistB's desk , ProtagonistA's hooves resting on the very smooth surface of the paper 
 ProtagonistA had been curious about this strange object ever since ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB using it 
 ProtagonistA had been trying to figure out how to use it ProtagonistA , but so far , ProtagonistA had n't had much success 
 ProtagonistA quickly jumped off the desk , hoping ProtagonistA had n't been caught 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA immediately started trying to write ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had finally figured out how to use the desk 
ProtagonistA cracked open ProtagonistA's newspaper , nudged the option beneath the headline Today , ProtagonistA was going to write a story about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been meaning to for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had first met ProtagonistB 
 As ProtagonistA began to write , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA getting more and more into the story 
 ProtagonistA detailed ProtagonistB's life , from ProtagonistB's childhood to ProtagonistB's present day 
 ProtagonistA wrote about ProtagonistB's successes and ProtagonistB's failures , ProtagonistB's relationships and ProtagonistB's friendships 
 ProtagonistA even included a quote from ProtagonistB , about the importance of always moving forward 
 By the time ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had really captured who ProtagonistB was as a person 
 ProtagonistA hoped that ProtagonistA's readers would feel the same way 
ProtagonistA whistled an old , hoof - tired tune as ProtagonistA peered around the edge of ProtagonistA's cottage at the vast , arid expanse beyond the great umbrella of emerald leaves that crowned the ceiling 
 ProtagonistA had been living in this cottage for years , ever since ProtagonistA had been forced to retire from ProtagonistA's post as a royal guard 
 It was n't the life ProtagonistA had envisioned for ProtagonistA , but it was peaceful and ProtagonistA was content 
 As a child , ProtagonistA had dreamed of becoming a knight like ProtagonistA's father 
 When ProtagonistA was old enough , ProtagonistA enlisted in the guard and worked ProtagonistA's way up the ranks 
 For years , ProtagonistA served the ProtagonistC and queen faithfully 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a twinge of jealousy , but ProtagonistA pushed it down 
 ProtagonistA was happy in ProtagonistA's cottage and did n't need ProtagonistC's approval 
 But now , as ProtagonistA looked out at the empty wasteland , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a sense of longing 
 ProtagonistA missed the excitement of Camelot 
 ProtagonistA missed the king and queen 
 And , most of all , ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA sat up on the front step of the house with ProtagonistA's eyes closed 
 ProtagonistA was trying to remember the dream ProtagonistA had just been having 
 ProtagonistA could n't quite remember 
 ProtagonistA heard someone coming up the walk and ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes 
   ProtagonistA 'm fine , thank ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA was just trying to remember a dream ProtagonistA had 
   Thanks , you too ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB walk away and then ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes again 
 Maybe if ProtagonistA concentrated hard enough , ProtagonistA could remember the dream 
 When ProtagonistA was younger , ProtagonistA had been scared of ProtagonistB , but now ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a kind and wise old man 
 Oh , not much ,  ProtagonistA replied 
  ProtagonistA 've just been waiting for the moment , talking to ProtagonistB , when it would happen 
 And what is it that ProtagonistA 're waiting for , ProtagonistB's dear?I'm waiting for ProtagonistA's feet to grow , so that ProtagonistA can go barefoot more often 
  And why do ProtagonistA want to go barefoot more often?I do n't know ,  ProtagonistA said 
 And why do ProtagonistA want ProtagonistA's hands to be less clumsy?So that ProtagonistA can do more things with them 
 ProtagonistA want to be able to write and draw and build things 
  And have ProtagonistA been doing any of those things?Yes ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 've been writing stories and drawing pictures 
 And ProtagonistA just finished building a model of a castle out of cardboard boxes 
 I am ,  ProtagonistA said 
  But ProtagonistA 'm still waiting for the moment when it will all come together and ProtagonistA 'll be able to do even more 
ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's wings for more than a year when ProtagonistA discovered what ProtagonistB , had been planning for a good long while 
 ProtagonistA was able to escape , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to warn the king 
 ProtagonistA flew as fast as ProtagonistA could to the palace and told the king what was happening 
ProtagonistA sat down and just watched as ProtagonistB squatted beside ProtagonistA and watched ProtagonistB draw ProtagonistB's bow and day out 
 As ProtagonistA watched , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB take careful aim and then release the arrow 
 ProtagonistA clapped ProtagonistA's hands in excitement , eager to try it ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA continued to practice , and before long , ProtagonistA was hitting the target just as accurately as ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was proud of ProtagonistA and grateful to ProtagonistB for teaching ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA sat at ProtagonistA's desk and watched as ProtagonistB leaned ProtagonistB's head onto ProtagonistA's shoulder 
 ProtagonistA was content just to sit there and be with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was going through a tough time and ProtagonistA wanted to be there for ProtagonistB , even if it was just in silence 
ProtagonistA was walking through the woods , thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how ProtagonistA wished things were different 
 ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistB and how ProtagonistB always seemed to be so strict with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could just leave and never come back 
 As ProtagonistA was thinking these things , ProtagonistA heard a noise behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw a man with a knife , coming towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die 
 As the man got closer , ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA ,  Oh , f - f - fucks if ProtagonistA kill you now 
  ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistB had not forbidden ProtagonistA to leave 
ProtagonistA was lying on the floor of ProtagonistA's room , bending forward 
 ProtagonistA had been there for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had received the news 
 ProtagonistA was only twenty - five 
 ProtagonistA heard the door open and ProtagonistB came in 
 ProtagonistA turned to ProtagonistB and buried ProtagonistA's face in ProtagonistB's shoulder 
 ProtagonistA cried until ProtagonistA had no tears left 
 Then ProtagonistA got up and walked out of the room 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep going , even though ProtagonistA did n't know how 
ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistA's hoof out of ProtagonistB's eyes , but fished out a few strands of pony hair , like ProtagonistA always had 
 Whenever ProtagonistA would find a stray hair on ProtagonistB's head , ProtagonistA would carefully remove it , making sure not to hurt ProtagonistB 
 Even though ProtagonistB was now a grown pony , ProtagonistA still liked to do it 
ProtagonistA had only once thought ProtagonistA would have a family , but now ProtagonistA believed that it was n't such a bad idea 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner and never really felt the need for a partner or children , but as ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA started to feel differently 
 Maybe it was because all ProtagonistA's friends were getting married and having kids , or maybe ProtagonistA was just feeling lonely , but whatever the reason , ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA wanted to try for a family of ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA started dating and went on a few dates with some nice guys , but none of them felt like the right fit 
 Then ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was kind , funny , and most importantly , ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistA was the only person in the world that mattered 
 ProtagonistA was happy and felt like ProtagonistA had finally found the family ProtagonistA always wanted 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had two beautiful children together and they were always surrounded by love 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA made the right decision when ProtagonistA decided to try for a family of ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA tried to scream , but no sound would come out 
 ProtagonistA tried to run , but ProtagonistA's feet were rooted to the spot 
 ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistB's cold , slimy skin against ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA could smell ProtagonistB's foul breath 
 ProtagonistA 're coming with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA could n't resist as ProtagonistB dragged ProtagonistA away 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistB was taking ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA knew it could n't be good 
 ProtagonistA was terrified of what ProtagonistB might do to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA tried to struggle , but it was no use 
 ProtagonistA was completely helpless against ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was lying on ProtagonistA's back , gazing up into the sky 
 ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace wash over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA watched the clouds drift by 
 ProtagonistA was content just to lie there and take in the beauty of the day 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA sat up and looked around , but there was no one there 
 ProtagonistA shrugged and lay back down , but the voice came again , louder this time 
 ProtagonistA got up and followed the sound until ProtagonistA came to the edge of a cliff 
 ProtagonistA looked down and saw ProtagonistB far below , clutching at the edge of a precipice 
 Without hesitation , ProtagonistA leapt off the cliff and flew down to save ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA stood and watched ProtagonistA's sister Dash ProtagonistB float by 
ProtagonistA had spent the day trying to convince ProtagonistB to let ProtagonistA's ride to the Everfree 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being stuck in ProtagonistC and wanted to explore the forest 
 ProtagonistA called out , but there was no answer 
 ProtagonistA began to feel scared and alone 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name 
 But ProtagonistA was not amused 
 ProtagonistA was angry and scared 
At the time , ProtagonistA was just about to head off to meet ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been trying to get ProtagonistB to come with ProtagonistA for weeks , but ProtagonistB always said no 
 ProtagonistA was finally going to convince ProtagonistB today 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB's house and knocked on the door 
 When ProtagonistB answered , ProtagonistA started talking 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the great time they would have and how much fun they would have 
ProtagonistA was a princess and ProtagonistA was not going anywhere 
 ProtagonistA was content to stay in ProtagonistA's castle and rule ProtagonistA's kingdom 
 ProtagonistA had a loyal subjects and a loving family 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life the way it was 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistA eventually agreed 
 ProtagonistA left her kingdom behind and went off to live with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's new life , but ProtagonistA always missed ProtagonistA's old kingdom 
ProtagonistA was standing there , wondering how to explain ProtagonistA's pregnancy without sounding like an idiot 
 ProtagonistA had only been with ProtagonistB for a few months , and ProtagonistA was already pregnant 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to tell ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistB would be mad 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and decided to just tell ProtagonistB the truth 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's house and knocked on the door 
 Then , ProtagonistB asked ,  ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA was n't sure , but ProtagonistA thought it had something to do with the fact that they had unprotected sex 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping ProtagonistB would be happy about the news 
ProtagonistA had ruptured ProtagonistA's ACL playing soccer with ProtagonistA's friends 
 After much thought , ProtagonistA decided to have the surgery 
 ProtagonistA was very grateful for ProtagonistB's help 
 Without ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would not have been able to get through ProtagonistA's recovery 
 Now , ProtagonistA is back to playing soccer and is even better than before 
 ProtagonistA is truly thankful for ProtagonistB and the support ProtagonistB provided during ProtagonistA's time of need 
ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's short life 
 Now , years later , ProtagonistA is a strong and independent woman 
 ProtagonistA has never forgotten ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA is determined to find ProtagonistB one day to thank ProtagonistB 
 In the year 1763 , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were the only residents of the village of Neuve - Chalmers 
 One day , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were out walking in the forest when they came across a small cottage 
ProtagonistA looked rather like a bimbos older or younger than ProtagonistA had been when ProtagonistA first met ProtagonistB for the first time , considering the circumstances 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a tight dress and high heels , and ProtagonistA's hair was styled in a way that made ProtagonistA look like ProtagonistA was ready for a night out on the town 
 ProtagonistA denied everything , but ProtagonistB was not convinced 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had been meeting men for money 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA needed the money , and ProtagonistA did not know what else to do 
 ProtagonistA hesitated at first , unsure if ProtagonistA wanted to help or not , but ProtagonistC could see the love and appreciation in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 Not only did ProtagonistA feel good about ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA also felt closer to ProtagonistB than ever before 
When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was so excited ProtagonistA had barely remembered what had happened the night before 
 ProtagonistA had been to the best party ever , and ProtagonistA was just about to go to bed when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's phone at the club 
 ProtagonistA was so upset that ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's phone , and ProtagonistA was even more upset when ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's purse at the club as well 
 ProtagonistA was so upset that ProtagonistA decided to go back to the club to look for ProtagonistA's phone and ProtagonistA's purse 
 When ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's purse , but ProtagonistA could n't find ProtagonistA's phone 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA's phone , and ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had seen it , but ProtagonistB did n't know where it was 
 ProtagonistA was so upset that ProtagonistA decided to go home 
 When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA went to bed , and ProtagonistA was so tired that ProtagonistA fell asleep 
ProtagonistA had been so anxious for ProtagonistB to take ProtagonistA's first flight ProtagonistA had not known until that moment that the spell they were about to cast was for something else altogether 
 ProtagonistA had been so excited to finally be able to experience what it was like to fly and see the world from above 
 But as ProtagonistA stood there , ready to take off , ProtagonistA realized that this was not what ProtagonistB had meant at all 
 ProtagonistA could feel the magic taking hold of ProtagonistA , pulling ProtagonistA into the unknown 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to expect , but ProtagonistA knew that whatever was waiting for ProtagonistA , it would be an adventure 
 It was a difficult feat , but ProtagonistA was determined to succeed 
 ProtagonistA had been practicing for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to get the hang of it 
 ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's best friend , and ProtagonistB was so proud of ProtagonistA for never giving up 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the rocking chair , ProtagonistB's hooves beneath ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA rocked gently back and forth , a content expression on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA looked down at ProtagonistB , a soft smile on ProtagonistA's lips 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would grow up to be a strong , independent mare , but for now ProtagonistA was happy to just sit and enjoy the moment 
ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way to the big horse show in town 
 ProtagonistA had been practicing hard and was excited to show off ProtagonistA's skills 
 As they approached the arena , ProtagonistA could see the other horses and riders getting ready 
 ProtagonistA felt a little nervous but was confident in ProtagonistA's abilities 
 When it was ProtagonistA's turn to enter the ring , ProtagonistA did so with a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA rode ProtagonistA's horse around the course , jumping over the fences and doing ProtagonistA best to show off ProtagonistA's skills 
 ProtagonistA had done it ! ProtagonistA had placed first in the horse show 
 ProtagonistA was so excited and proud of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and Shining Armor for their support and went off to celebrate ProtagonistA's victory 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the field of our estate , looking at a photograph of ProtagonistB , with the utmost circumstance of safety 
 ProtagonistA had been waiting for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had first heard about ProtagonistB 
 Finally , ProtagonistA had been able to track ProtagonistB down , and ProtagonistA had been following ProtagonistB for days 
 ProtagonistA had been careful to keep ProtagonistA's distance , and to make sure that ProtagonistB never saw ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA had been able to get close enough to take a few photographs 
 And now ProtagonistA was sitting in the field , looking at one of those photographs 
 ProtagonistA could see the intelligence in ProtagonistB's eyes , and the strength in ProtagonistB's jaw 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would be able to help ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's own problems 
 ProtagonistA just had to find a way to get close to ProtagonistB , and to get ProtagonistB to trust ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the great grave , ignorant of all the history of the kingdom 
 ProtagonistA had no intention of ever going back 
 ProtagonistA did n't know why , but ProtagonistA trusted ProtagonistB 
 After a while , ProtagonistA got up and dusted ProtagonistA off 
 ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was in a graveyard 
 ProtagonistA saw the headstones and remembered ProtagonistB's words 
  ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was sitting on the grave of the Queen of Hearts 
ProtagonistA was born as the son of a salaried workman in the midst of a profusion of pre - war industries of industrial importance , and who , having hung on throughout a highly successful career , has made ProtagonistA's fortune by , and in fact made ProtagonistA's fortune quite a while ago , by the methods which ProtagonistA has adopted to capitalize upon ProtagonistA's great fortune , although of late the conflict of interest which ProtagonistB enjoyed , in procuring a certain amount of capital , has become a serious matter ProtagonistA was always a bright child , and ProtagonistA quickly learned how to capitalize on ProtagonistA's strengths 
 ProtagonistA was very good at making friends and networking , and ProtagonistA quickly learned how to use ProtagonistA's charms to get what ProtagonistA wanted 
 ProtagonistA was also very good at making money , and ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA could use ProtagonistA's money to get ahead in life 
 ProtagonistA is now a very successful woman , and ProtagonistA has made a fortune by using ProtagonistA's unique talents 
There was ProtagonistA in the full light of the morning , and ProtagonistA was very tired 
 ProtagonistA had been up all night , trying to finish ProtagonistA's homework , and ProtagonistA was just about to give up and go to bed when ProtagonistA heard a noise outside 
 ProtagonistA went to the window and saw ProtagonistB sitting on the curb , crying ProtagonistB's eyes out 
 ProtagonistA felt bad for ProtagonistB , so ProtagonistA went outside to see if ProtagonistA could help 
 When ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistB was crying because ProtagonistB had lost ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistC's name was , and ProtagonistB said it was Mr
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistB did 
 Just when they were about to give up , ProtagonistA heard a meow coming from a tree 
 ProtagonistA climbed up the tree , and there was ProtagonistC , stuck in a branch 
 ProtagonistA got ProtagonistC down , and ProtagonistB was so happy to have ProtagonistC back 
 ProtagonistA went back inside , and ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA had helped ProtagonistB 
 It made ProtagonistA feel good to know that ProtagonistA had made someone 's day a little bit better 
ProtagonistA had never known that ProtagonistB did n't like ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had always thought that ProtagonistB was just a grumpy old man who did n't want to be bothered with ProtagonistA 
 But one day , ProtagonistA overheard ProtagonistB talking to ProtagonistA's mother 
  After that , ProtagonistA tried to be a better daughter , but ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was being compared to ProtagonistA's siblings and found wanting 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a recluse , preferring to stay in ProtagonistA's workshop tinkering with ProtagonistA's latest invention rather than spend time with ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA had been cheating on ProtagonistC with ProtagonistC's best friend 
 ProtagonistA's only response was that ProtagonistA was  in love  with ProtagonistB's friend 
 As far as ProtagonistB was concerned , ProtagonistA was dead to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had been taking the ferry down the winding stone steps into the harbor for years 
 ProtagonistA had never missed a day 
 ProtagonistA could n't seem to get up 
  ProtagonistA tried to stand , but ProtagonistA's legs would n't work 
  ProtagonistA 've never been late before 
  ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA had been feeling tired lately , but ProtagonistA thought it was just because ProtagonistA was getting old 
 Now ProtagonistA was n't so sure 
ProtagonistA watched in horror as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB die 
 ProtagonistA had seen death before , but never like this 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could n't just stand by and watch 
 ProtagonistA had to do something 
 ProtagonistA had led ProtagonistB to a strange place 
 ProtagonistA was sitting on a large mushroom , eating a carrot 
 ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistA just continued to eat ProtagonistA's carrot 
 ProtagonistA , please ,  ProtagonistB begged 
 Again , ProtagonistA said nothing 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and motioned for ProtagonistB to go inside 
 ProtagonistA , feeling a sudden warmth in ProtagonistA's cheeks , turned ProtagonistA's head away from the Equestrians 
 ProtagonistA caught the eye of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA watched , entranced , as they moved around the room , their bodies graceful and powerful 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt a hand on ProtagonistA's shoulder , and ProtagonistA was being pulled to ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistA looked up into the eyes of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream as ProtagonistA was swept up in the music and the movement 
  ProtagonistB , can ProtagonistA walk the rest of the way by ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 So ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's backpack and continued on to school by ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was cold , but ProtagonistA felt good walking on ProtagonistA's own 
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA saw a light up ahead 
 ProtagonistA walked towards it and saw that it was a lamp on a small table 
 ProtagonistA picked it up and looked around 
 ProtagonistA saw a door in the tree and a key on the table 
 ProtagonistA put the key in the door and turned it 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden 
 ProtagonistA blinked widely , as though ProtagonistA were trying to find the light 
 ProtagonistA walked around the garden and saw a castle in the distance 
 ProtagonistA started to walk towards it , but ProtagonistA was suddenly pulled back 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB standing there 
  Who are ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who lived in a small town 
 ProtagonistA was a simple girl who worked hard and did n't have much 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the woods when ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was now able to make deals with anyone ProtagonistA wanted 
 ProtagonistA quickly became the most powerful person in the world 
ProtagonistA was walking home from the back of the church , where ProtagonistA had been having a rough passage due to ProtagonistA , and which was in ProtagonistA's own shoes , with ProtagonistA's hat on 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about the events of the day and how ProtagonistA could have handled them better 
 ProtagonistA was also thinking about the future and what ProtagonistA wanted to do with ProtagonistA's life 
 As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB walking in front of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA wondered what ProtagonistB did for a living 
 ProtagonistA also wondered if ProtagonistB had ever had a rough passage in ProtagonistB's life 
 The night after ProtagonistB's death , ProtagonistA spent the night in a hospital room with a needle in ProtagonistA's arm and a tube in ProtagonistA's leg 
 In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing in a field of flowers 
 ProtagonistA woke up from ProtagonistA's dream feeling comforted and hopeful 
 Even though ProtagonistB was gone , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was still with ProtagonistB in spirit 
ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA back on the landscape and ProtagonistB said ,  That 's it , then 
 ProtagonistA 's free , though ProtagonistA doubts it 
 ProtagonistA was at a party once 
 ProtagonistA sighed and shook ProtagonistA's head 
  ProtagonistA do n't know , ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 're not giving up on anything 
 ProtagonistA 're just moving on to the next phase of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA 've been talking about it for months now 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was right , but ProtagonistA still could n't help but feel a little sad as ProtagonistA turned away from ProtagonistA's home of the last ten years 
 ProtagonistA had loved living in the city , but it was time for a change 
 And ProtagonistA was ready for the next adventure 
ProtagonistA had always been good at cards 
 ProtagonistA could remember back to when ProtagonistA was a little girl , sitting at the kitchen table with ProtagonistA's mother and father , playing Go Fish and War 
 ProtagonistA had always had a knack for reading people and knowing what cards they were holding 
 As ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA could use ProtagonistA's skills to make money 
 So , some time in the latter half of the eighteenth century , ProtagonistA set out to steal the title of Ruben de Vros , notwithstanding the great advantages which ProtagonistA had acquired by ProtagonistA's skill in the art of card - playing 
 ProtagonistA went to the best casinos in Europe and cleaned them out , one by one 
 But ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA was on a roll and nothing was going to stop ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA started playing in underground games , where the stakes were higher and the players were more desperate 
 ProtagonistA won more money than ProtagonistA knew what to do with and rubbed elbows with the criminal underworld 
 One night , ProtagonistA was playing in a high - stakes game with some of the most dangerous people in the world 
 Desperate and broke , ProtagonistA made a deal with ProtagonistB to give ProtagonistB information on other card players in exchange for money 
 ProtagonistA became a professional gambler and a con artist , using ProtagonistA's skills to take advantage of other people 
 ProtagonistA ruined lives and ruined ProtagonistA in the process 
ProtagonistA , sitting crosslegged on a damp stone floor , had a cigarette lighter in each hand , and a bundle of twigs in front of ProtagonistA , containing nothing but a wide - brimmed hat and a pair of straw gloves 
 ProtagonistA was trying to light a fire , but the dampness of the twigs made it difficult 
 ProtagonistA had been at it for hours , and ProtagonistA's fingers were getting sore from holding the lighters 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw a spark catch on one of the twigs 
 ProtagonistA quickly cupped ProtagonistA's hands around it to shelter it from the damp air , and soon a small fire was burning 
 ProtagonistA added some of the larger twigs to the fire , and then sat back to warm ProtagonistA's hands 
 ProtagonistA was so focused on the fire that ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching until they were right behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistB standing there , watching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how long ProtagonistB had been there , but ProtagonistA did n't feel scared 
 ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB , and they went on the most amazing honeymoon 
In the year of our Lord 2001 , ProtagonistA was sitting in the chair , with ProtagonistA's hat on the mantelpiece , and ProtagonistB next to ProtagonistA , which was a very strange arrangement 
 What are ProtagonistB looking at ?  ProtagonistA asked 
  ProtagonistA 're a very strange woman 
 And ProtagonistB 're a very strange man ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 're in a lot of trouble 
 What kind of trouble ?  ProtagonistA asked 
  ProtagonistA need to leave this place 
 Why ?  ProtagonistA asked 
  But ProtagonistA need to trust ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA need to come with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment 
 ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA could trust ProtagonistB 
 But then ProtagonistA thought about all the trouble ProtagonistA was in 
 ProtagonistA was in danger 
 ProtagonistA needed to leave 
 ProtagonistA stood up and followed ProtagonistB out of the house 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what was going to happen , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to trust ProtagonistB 
 You're going to be lonely ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA was a paralegal at a small law firm and ProtagonistA was given a file to examine 
 ProtagonistA looked through the file and found a bank statement from a hidden bank account 
 ProtagonistA also found a document showing that the husband had purchased a life insurance policy with his wife as the beneficiary 
 ProtagonistA brought these findings to ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB was able to use them to get a better settlement for the wife 
As ProtagonistA stood at ProtagonistA's office door , waiting to be summoned , ProtagonistA noticed that the door was open 
 ProtagonistA peered inside and saw ProtagonistB , sitting at ProtagonistB's desk 
 ProtagonistA was about to knock on the door when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB speaking on the phone 
  ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart sink as ProtagonistA heard the words 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had been with the company for a long time and that ProtagonistA was a good worker 
 ProtagonistA did n't deserve to be treated like this 
 ProtagonistA was about to turn and leave when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB say ,  ProtagonistA , come in 
  ProtagonistA walked into the office and sat down in the chair across from ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's eyes fill with tears as ProtagonistA heard the words 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do 
 ProtagonistA had been with the company for five years and this was the first time ProtagonistA had ever been let go from a job 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to support ProtagonistA's family 
ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way through the city , noticing the strange looks ProtagonistA got from the people around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew they were wondering why ProtagonistA was there , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to make a good impression 
 ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way to ProtagonistB's office , and ProtagonistA made a noticeable effort to be friendly , although ProtagonistA knew well enough from ProtagonistA's long experience in the city that the term seemed more than a little strange to ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA need a runner ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and took the list 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's living room , reading a book , when ProtagonistA got a call from ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB and wished ProtagonistB all the best 
ProtagonistA was hunting down a rabbit when ProtagonistA heard the awful noise of the gunfight 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , ProtagonistA just wanted to get away from the noise 
 ProtagonistA ran for what felt like hours until ProtagonistA finally came to a stop 
 ProtagonistA leaned against a tree to catch ProtagonistA's breath and that 's when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die 
 ProtagonistB was happy that ProtagonistA was making friends and that ProtagonistA was including ProtagonistC in ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA had been walking very slow all morning , reaching ProtagonistA's destination in the town of Trafalgar , about eight miles south of Manchester 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , ever since ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's home in Liverpool 
 ProtagonistA was tired , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore , but ProtagonistA kept walking 
 ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had heard that ProtagonistB was living in Trafalgar , and ProtagonistA was determined to find ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA walked up and down the streets , asking people if they had seen ProtagonistB , but no one had 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC walking towards ProtagonistA 
 Hello ,  ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA 'm looking for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistB 
When ProtagonistA was sixteen , ProtagonistA was sitting alone in ProtagonistA's room , thinking of ProtagonistA's future after the war 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a doctor , but now ProtagonistA was n't so sure 
 ProtagonistA had seen so much death and destruction during the war , and ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA could handle it anymore 
 ProtagonistA was also thinking about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistB was alive or dead , and ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA could handle the thought of losing ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was young and beautiful , and ProtagonistB could see the promise of a great reign ahead 
 ProtagonistA appreciated ProtagonistB's loyalty , and they became friends 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm sorry to say this , but ProtagonistA 've overshot ProtagonistA's task 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB wanted ProtagonistA to do a good job 
  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA said as ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's things and left 
ProtagonistA should have known that ProtagonistB was a total loser 
 ProtagonistA was such a fool in the beginning , when ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB was a catch 
 ProtagonistA should have known better when ProtagonistB started hitting ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA stayed with ProtagonistB , because ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB 
 One day , ProtagonistA came home and found ProtagonistB in bed with another woman 
 ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and left , never to look back 
 ProtagonistA should have known better from the beginning 
 ProtagonistA had a suitcase in one hand and a bag in the other 
 When ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA smiled 
A young man , a man of twenty four , ProtagonistA had the name of ProtagonistB , but for all that ProtagonistA was not a very good liar 
 But ProtagonistA had to try 
 ProtagonistA had no money to pay for the food ProtagonistA had taken , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would be in big trouble if ProtagonistA was caught 
 ProtagonistA was desperate , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be able to help ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB knew something was up 
 However , when the police came to arrest ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB was the one who told them where ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA was shocked , and ProtagonistA could n't believe that ProtagonistB had betrayed ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was happy living ProtagonistA's life by ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't need anyone else and was content with ProtagonistA's own company 
 However , one day ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistB and finally felt like ProtagonistA belonged somewhere 
Once upon a time , when the world was young , ProtagonistA was walking home one cold Thursday evening in August , and ProtagonistA came upon a little stone church on a green and flowery street , or in better letters Rickson , on the south side of ProtagonistB , in which the main thoroughfares led down to the narrow streets and galleries of the lower part of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA hesitated a moment , then lifted the latch and went in 
 When the service was over , ProtagonistA went up to ProtagonistC to introduce ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistC 'm glad ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's way to our little church 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistC and said ProtagonistA would 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would be back 
 ProtagonistA was always dreaming of ProtagonistA's wedding day and what it would be like 
 ProtagonistA had planned everything out perfectly in ProtagonistA's head , but ProtagonistA never thought that it would actually happen 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the park and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and they began talking 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who loved to explore 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole and decided to follow it 
 ProtagonistA ended up in ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had many adventures in ProtagonistB and made many new friends 
 ProtagonistA even met a talking rabbit ! ProtagonistA eventually found ProtagonistA's way back home , but ProtagonistA always remembered ProtagonistA's adventures in ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had been on the road for days , ever since ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's home in the city 
 ProtagonistA had been heading north , towards the mountains , but now ProtagonistA was stopped in ProtagonistA's tracks 
 ProtagonistA sighed as ProtagonistA put up the last of the white slacks that covered the back of the carriage 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping to find some kind of help or shelter before nightfall , but it seemed like that was not going to be the case 
 ProtagonistA was about to turn back around and head back the way ProtagonistA came when ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance 
 ProtagonistA followed the noise until ProtagonistA came to a small clearing 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to just leave ProtagonistB there , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to help ProtagonistB either 
 ProtagonistA was about to turn and go back the way ProtagonistA came when ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with pleading eyes 
 ProtagonistA sighed and sat down next to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA could say to make ProtagonistB feel better , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to try 
 It 's going to be alright ,  ProtagonistA said softly 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what else to do , so ProtagonistA just sat there with ProtagonistB until ProtagonistB fell asleep 
 When morning came , ProtagonistA woke ProtagonistB up and helped ProtagonistB to ProtagonistB's feet 
 ProtagonistA led ProtagonistB back to the road and helped ProtagonistB to find ProtagonistB's way home 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what would happen to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had done what ProtagonistA could 
ProtagonistA , in the year 1581 , appeared on the scene with a discovery ProtagonistA could not have dreamed of three years before : in the journal of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA found two passages which ProtagonistA named The Book of Dreams 
 ProtagonistA was amazed by these dreams and felt that they must have some special meaning 
 ProtagonistA was convinced that they were signs from ProtagonistD , and ProtagonistA was determined to find out what they meant 
 ProtagonistA began to study the Book of Dreams , and ProtagonistA soon came to believe that they were indeed messages from ProtagonistD 
 ProtagonistA began to share ProtagonistA's interpretation of the dreams with others , and ProtagonistA soon became known as a prophetess 
 ProtagonistA became a leader of a new religious movement , and ProtagonistA began to preach about the power of dreams and their ability to reveal the future 
 ProtagonistA started to make predictions about the future , and many of ProtagonistA's prophecies came true 
 ProtagonistA predicted the rise of a great ruler who would bring peace to the world , and ProtagonistA was proved right when Queen Elizabeth I came to the throne 
 ProtagonistA was a powerful voice for change , and ProtagonistA helped to bring about many reforms in the country 
In the midst of the great maze of blind alleys and crumbling buildings of London , on a sunny summer day in the year 1665 , ProtagonistA was able to enjoy the quiet hours of ProtagonistA's childhood when ProtagonistA alighted on streets where ProtagonistA could chat with pedestrians and shopkeepers without arousing suspicion 
 But ProtagonistA was fearless , and ProtagonistA loved to explore 
 One day , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a part of the city ProtagonistA had never seen before 
 ProtagonistA felt a little uneasy , but ProtagonistA was curious to see what was around the next corner 
 As ProtagonistA turned a corner , ProtagonistA saw a group of boys standing in a circle 
 But as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistB was not a child or an animal , but a small , old man 
 ProtagonistA ran to ProtagonistB and knelt down beside ProtagonistB 
  Are ProtagonistB all right ?  ProtagonistA asked , gently helping ProtagonistB to sit up 
 ProtagonistA was about to help ProtagonistB to ProtagonistB's feet when ProtagonistA heard the sound of running footsteps 
 ProtagonistA grabbed ProtagonistB's hand and ran with ProtagonistB down the street , not looking back until they were safe 
Not long ago , when ProtagonistA was a boy , ProtagonistA only knew how to read and write 
ProtagonistA had been waiting in line for the bus for what felt like forever 
 ProtagonistA was getting impatient and was about to give up and go home when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so angry that ProtagonistA shouted at ProtagonistB ,  Time 's up , ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistA shouted down at ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a peg - legged pirate who had lost ProtagonistA's leg in a battle with a giant squid 
 ProtagonistA was now the captain of ProtagonistA's own ship , the Black Pearl 
 ProtagonistA was standing on the platform of one of the other ships , the White Shark , that was docked in the middle city 
 ProtagonistA was looking at the other ships and thinking about ProtagonistA's next move 
 ProtagonistA had to find a way to get ProtagonistA's ship out of the city and back to the open sea 
 ProtagonistA knew that the White Shark was a fast ship and could outrun any of the other ships in the city 
 ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistB , was a good friend of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA decided to go and talk to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB's help ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA need to get ProtagonistA's ship out of the city 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB got their ships out of the city and back to the open sea 
ProtagonistA had nothing to do with it , ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA was just in the wrong place at the wrong time 
 ProtagonistA was the only one who could have done it 
 But ProtagonistA swore ProtagonistA did n't do it 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was innocent 
 But ProtagonistA swore ProtagonistA did n't do it 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was innocent 
 But ProtagonistA swore ProtagonistA did n't do it 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was innocent 
 But ProtagonistA swore ProtagonistA did n't do it 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was innocent 
ProtagonistA was a unicorn who was always getting into trouble 
 ProtagonistA was always doing something wrong and it seemed like nothing ProtagonistA did was ever right 
 ProtagonistA might not be a good unicorn , but ProtagonistA 's not going anywhere 
ProtagonistA had always been a bright girl , but ProtagonistA was especially sharp for ProtagonistA's eleven years 
 ProtagonistA had been so busy with business of which ProtagonistA did not know at the time just how many it involved — foremost of all , business in the real world 
 In the real world , ProtagonistA had to be careful 
 It was a lot of work , but ProtagonistA was up for the challenge 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking near ProtagonistA's home when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should stay away from ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was curious 
 ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistB cautiously 
 Hello ,  ProtagonistA said 
  Can ProtagonistA help you?The man stepped out of the shadows 
 Do ProtagonistA know her?Alice 's heart skipped a beat 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should n't tell ProtagonistB anything , but ProtagonistA was also afraid of what would happen if ProtagonistA did n't 
 ProtagonistA decided to stall for time 
 Maybe ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was lying 
 ProtagonistA do n't believe ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB go , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
 ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistB was up to no good 
 ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistA and warn ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA woke up from ProtagonistA's dream panting 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had just run a marathon 
 In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA was in a vast garden surrounded by a crowd of people 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was the only one who could see them 
 ProtagonistA felt a tap on ProtagonistA's shoulder and woke up to find ProtagonistB shaking ProtagonistA awake 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA were moaning in ProtagonistA's sleep 
 ProtagonistA just had a really weird dream ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA lay in ProtagonistA's bed for a few more minutes , trying to remember the details of ProtagonistA's dream 
 ProtagonistA was sure that it meant something , but ProtagonistA could n't quite figure out what 
ProtagonistA was an old woman who lived on a horse 
 ProtagonistA was very much of this world , but ProtagonistA had neither the strength nor the patience for weariness nor for labor 
 ProtagonistA was never mowing grass alone 
 One day , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB would like to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had just finished ProtagonistA's morning prayers and was about to enjoy a cup of tea when ProtagonistA heard a commotion coming from the roof of the Boston house 
 ProtagonistA went to investigate and saw that a group of ProtagonistB's followers were gathered there , apparently preparing to re - enact something 
 ProtagonistA was curious to know what was going on , so ProtagonistA asked one of the members what was happening 
 When it was over , ProtagonistA thanked the members for letting ProtagonistA witness the event and went back to ProtagonistA's tea 
 ProtagonistA had seen the signs of a shipwreck on the other side of the island , so ProtagonistA knew there must be other people around here somewhere 
 But ProtagonistA had yet to find them 
 As ProtagonistA lay there , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA sat up , hopeful that ProtagonistB was another castaway 
 But as ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB was not a person at all , but a large , furry creature 
 ProtagonistA had heard stories of people being killed and eaten by bears 
 ProtagonistA scrambled to ProtagonistA's feet and started to run , but ProtagonistB was faster than ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes , expecting the worst 
 But instead of being eaten , ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistB licking ProtagonistA's face 
 When ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes , ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB looked just as scared as ProtagonistA felt 
 Please do n't eat ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA begged 
 ProtagonistA felt a pang of sympathy for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew how ProtagonistB felt 
 Let 's team up ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB spent the next few days searching the island for food 
 This looks promising ,  ProtagonistA said 
 Thank ProtagonistB for not eating ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was three years old when ProtagonistB died 
 ProtagonistA remembers that ProtagonistB was always so kind to ProtagonistA , even when ProtagonistA was having a bad day 
 ProtagonistA would always go to ProtagonistB's house after school and they would spend hours talking and laughing together 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to cope with the loss of ProtagonistB 
 But over time , ProtagonistA began to heal 
 Now , whenever ProtagonistA thinks of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA smiles 
 ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA did n't mean to 
 ProtagonistA was just trying to help 
 ProtagonistA did n't know that would happen 
 ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistC more than anything in the world 
ProtagonistA was having a lovely time at the tea party when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB's most recent folly 
 ProtagonistA stood up and announced to the others that ProtagonistA was going to put a stop to ProtagonistB's madness once and for all 
 ProtagonistA marched over to where ProtagonistB was standing and confronted ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA demanded to know what ProtagonistB was thinking , creating such a ridiculous plot 
 ProtagonistA was so angry that ProtagonistA wanted to scream , but ProtagonistA knew that would only give ProtagonistB the satisfaction of knowing ProtagonistB had gotten to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and walked away , vowing to never give ProtagonistB the satisfaction of winning again 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the front steps of their house , looking down at the dusty back lot 
 ProtagonistA did n't believe it when ProtagonistA saw a figure walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB in years 
 ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA ca n't believe it ! What are ProtagonistB doing here ?  ProtagonistA said , as ProtagonistA got up to give ProtagonistB a hug 
 ProtagonistA 've been busy too 
 I'd like that ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA sat back down on the steps , smiling to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was a smart little thing 
 ProtagonistA was not really a girl , but which people thought was a girl , because ProtagonistA would turn into ProtagonistB instead of into a girl 
 And ProtagonistA had been mistaken , they say , from the first moment when ProtagonistA was born 
 ProtagonistA had believed everything ProtagonistA had been told 
 But one day , ProtagonistA began to doubt 
 ProtagonistA started to wonder why ProtagonistA was always turned into ProtagonistB 
 Was it because ProtagonistA was really a bad person ? Or was it because the people around ProtagonistA were just ProtagonistA decided to find out for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA started to act like a girl , and to ProtagonistA's surprise , ProtagonistA began to turn into one 
 The more ProtagonistA did it , the more ProtagonistA became like a girl , until ProtagonistA was one completely 
 Now , ProtagonistA is a happy girl , and ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA was never really a bad person , despite what people might have thought 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA was just misunderstood , and that ProtagonistA is now exactly who ProtagonistA was meant to be 
ProtagonistA was in so much pain that ProtagonistA could barely move 
 ProtagonistA slowly rolled over , trying to get away from the source of the pain 
 When ProtagonistA finally stopped moving , ProtagonistA looked up and saw ProtagonistB lying on the ground next to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was walking home from school when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing on the side of the road 
 ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was in distress , so ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistB to see if ProtagonistA could help 
 ProtagonistA , being the helpful person ProtagonistA is , said that ProtagonistA knew of a farmhouse not too far from there that might be able to help 
 ProtagonistA offered to take ProtagonistB there , and ProtagonistB accepted 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB all about ProtagonistA's life on the farm and how much ProtagonistA loved animals 
 ProtagonistA hesitated , but ProtagonistB assured ProtagonistA that they were just a harmless old couple 
 ProtagonistA walked into the farmhouse and was immediately greeted by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA would love to , and the two exchanged addresses 
 ProtagonistA walked home that night feeling happy and content 
 ProtagonistA had made some new friends , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would always remember ProtagonistA's meeting with the Listers 
ProtagonistA came in a beaten and battered carriage 
 ProtagonistA was carrying ProtagonistB across the country 
 ProtagonistA was tired and the journey was long , but ProtagonistA did not complain 
 ProtagonistA just kept going 
 When they finally arrived home , ProtagonistA put ProtagonistB in bed and tended to ProtagonistB's wounds 
 ProtagonistA did not know if ProtagonistB would make it through the night 
 ProtagonistA had been in the forest for days , ever since ProtagonistA had run away from home 
 ProtagonistA was tired , and hungry , and ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's family 
 But ProtagonistA was also determined to find ProtagonistA's way back to them 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been there for ProtagonistB , holding ProtagonistB's hand and telling ProtagonistB everything would be alright 
 ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's only family and now ProtagonistA had no one 
 As ProtagonistA stood there , looking at ProtagonistB's grave , ProtagonistA swore ProtagonistA would never let ProtagonistA be so vulnerable again 
 ProtagonistA would never let anyone in and ProtagonistA would never love anyone as much as ProtagonistA had loved ProtagonistB 
 From that day on , ProtagonistA became a cold and heartless woman 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole and decided to follow it 
 ProtagonistA ended up in ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had many adventures in ProtagonistB and made many new friends 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's way back home 
ProtagonistA was overjoyed when ProtagonistA was told that ProtagonistA would be having dinner with ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA arrived at ProtagonistB's house , ProtagonistA was amazed by its beauty 
ProtagonistA had been standing in the doorway all night , waiting for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been waiting for ProtagonistB to come home from work , but ProtagonistB never came 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was working late , but ProtagonistA could n't help but worry 
 ProtagonistA was about to go to bed when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB's key in the door 
 ProtagonistA ran to ProtagonistB and hugged ProtagonistB tightly 
 ProtagonistA was so relieved ProtagonistB was finally home 
ProtagonistA was living in ProtagonistA's cousin 's vast old house in Pannonward called the Park 
 ProtagonistA loved spending time in the park , reading and picnicking with ProtagonistA's friends 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was enjoying the sunshine , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had only been a woman of ProtagonistA's word , when a magic box stood in ProtagonistA's front door , containing a box of eleven tiny little things , wrapped in a blue and white little envelope 
 ProtagonistA had promised ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA would never open it , but the temptation was too great 
 ProtagonistA carefully unwrapped the envelope andopened the box 
 ProtagonistA could n't resist poking ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so astonished that ProtagonistA forgot to be scared 
 ProtagonistA watched as the eleven tiny people scurried about , trying to hide from ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA sat down and watched them , feeling like ProtagonistA had been given a gift 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget them 
ProtagonistA had always wanted a dog 
 ProtagonistA would beg ProtagonistA's parents for one every time they went to the pet store , but they always said no 
 ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB quickly became ProtagonistA's best friend 
 ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistB for walks , play fetch with ProtagonistB in the yard , and snuggle with ProtagonistB at night 
 ProtagonistA was a carpenter , and ProtagonistB was a housewife 
 One day , ProtagonistA came home from work and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had been thinking about getting a divorce 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA was not happy with their life , and ProtagonistA wanted to try something new 
 ProtagonistA agreed , and ProtagonistA went to work the next day 
 However , ProtagonistA could not stop thinking about what ProtagonistB had said 
 ProtagonistA thought about it all day , and ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA wanted to get a divorce 
 ProtagonistA went home and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had made up ProtagonistA's mind 
ProtagonistA was a bit confused when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's school 
 ProtagonistA thought that maybe ProtagonistA was seeing things but when ProtagonistA looked again , ProtagonistB was still there 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to think or do so ProtagonistA just stared at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart flutter a bit and ProtagonistA quickly looked away 
 ProtagonistA did n't know why but ProtagonistA felt drawn to ProtagonistB 
 Throughout the day , ProtagonistA would catch glimpses of ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA started to feel more and more comfortable around ProtagonistB 
 By the end of the day , ProtagonistA had mustered up the courage to talk to ProtagonistB 
 Hi , ProtagonistA 'm Alice ,  ProtagonistA said shyly 
 ProtagonistA and John quickly became friends and they would often talk and laugh together 
 ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA had finally found someone who understood ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA is sitting down by the window , reading a book which ProtagonistA has brought into ProtagonistA's room , and without speaking 
 ProtagonistA is so engrossed in the book that ProtagonistA does not hear ProtagonistB come into the room 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA , why are ProtagonistA reading in ProtagonistA's room by ProtagonistA ? Do n't ProtagonistA want to come downstairs and spend some time with the ProtagonistA looks up from ProtagonistA's book , a little embarrassed 
 ProtagonistA just really wanted to finish this book 
 ProtagonistA goes back to ProtagonistA's book , and ProtagonistB leaves the room 
 ProtagonistA , there ProtagonistA are 
 ProtagonistA just really wanted to finish this book 
 ProtagonistA goes back to ProtagonistA's book , and ProtagonistA's father leaves the room 
 ProtagonistA does not hear ProtagonistA's brother come in a few minutes later 
 ProtagonistA , there ProtagonistA are 
 ProtagonistA goes back to ProtagonistA's book , and ProtagonistA's brother leaves the room 
 ProtagonistA is so engrossed in the story that ProtagonistA does not hear the doorbell ring a few minutes later 
 ProtagonistA does not hear ProtagonistB come upstairs and tell ProtagonistA that there is someone there to see ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA is so surprised when ProtagonistA sees ProtagonistA's best friend standing in the doorway that ProtagonistA almost drops ProtagonistA's book 
 What are you doing here ?  ProtagonistA exclaims 
 And ProtagonistA was reading because ProtagonistA wanted to , not because ProtagonistA was lonely 
 ProtagonistA was just reading a book 
 ProtagonistA goes back to ProtagonistA's book , and ProtagonistA's friend leaves the room 
 ProtagonistA is so engrossed in the story that ProtagonistA does not hear ProtagonistB come in a few minutes later 
 ProtagonistA need to put ProtagonistA's book away now and get some sleep 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to finish this chapter 
 ProtagonistA nods and goes back to ProtagonistA's book 
 ProtagonistA is so engrossed in the story that ProtagonistA does not hear ProtagonistB leave the room 
 ProtagonistA does not hear ProtagonistA's father come in a few minutes later 
 ProtagonistA , there ProtagonistA are 
 ProtagonistA just really wanted to finish this book 
 ProtagonistA goes back to ProtagonistA's book , and ProtagonistA's father leaves the room 
 ProtagonistA is so engrossed in the story that ProtagonistA does not hear ProtagonistB come in a few minutes later 
 ProtagonistA need to put ProtagonistA's book away now and get some sleep 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to finish this chapter 
 ProtagonistA nods and goes back to ProtagonistA's book 
 ProtagonistA is so engrossed in the story that ProtagonistA does not hear ProtagonistB leave the room 
 ProtagonistA does not hear ProtagonistA's father come back in a few minutes later 
 ProtagonistA had blue eyes , brown hair , and a florid face 
ProtagonistA was an old woman who lived in a small village in China 
 ProtagonistA agreed and said ,  Our granda said , said ProtagonistA , that ProtagonistB was the daughter of the Empress Cǎo ; but ProtagonistB lived before that , and has been dead many years 
 ProtagonistA told them that ProtagonistB was a very beautiful woman who lived in a palace 
 However , ProtagonistA always felt a sense of longing for ProtagonistA's homeland 
 With nowhere else to go , ProtagonistA set off on foot by ProtagonistA's father 's donkey , Yede 
 ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to find a way to make a new life for ProtagonistA 
 After walking for days , ProtagonistA came across a small village 
 ProtagonistA quickly fell in love with the village and its people 
 ProtagonistA began working as a farmhand and soon became one of the most respected members of the community 
 After a few years , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC and they got married 
 ProtagonistA continued to live in the village for the rest of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had four children with ProtagonistC and watched as they grew up and had children of their own 
 As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA often thought about ProtagonistA's homeland and the orphanage ProtagonistA had once called home 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have found a new home in the village and knew that ProtagonistA would always be welcome there 
 It was as if ProtagonistA was the only one who mattered in the world 
 ProtagonistA took full advantage of this newfound attention , and soon had ProtagonistB wrapped around ProtagonistA's finger 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would do anything ProtagonistA asked , and ProtagonistA used this to ProtagonistA's advantage 
 ProtagonistA would ask for money when ProtagonistA wanted it , and ProtagonistB would give it to ProtagonistA without question 
 ProtagonistA would go on shopping sprees and then return home to find ProtagonistB had already paid the bill 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB wrapped around ProtagonistA's finger , and ProtagonistA loved it 
 ProtagonistA loved feeling like ProtagonistA was the most important person in the world 
 And ProtagonistA loved knowing that ProtagonistB would do anything ProtagonistA asked 
ProtagonistA was the daughter of a Brooklyn market girl and a remorseless explorer 
 One day , as ProtagonistA was about to board the train , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt a sudden kinship with ProtagonistB and decided to strike up a conversation 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB became fast friends 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's exploration of the world beyond the Bronx and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's own explorations of the world within the borough 
 ProtagonistA and Lily are proof of that 
ProtagonistA was nothing more than a mortal , and ProtagonistA had plenty of friends and lovers who ProtagonistA could trust 
 However , one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA soon fell in love with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA awoke the next day , feeling different 
 ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistB's presence inside ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had been changed forever 
 ProtagonistA was now a vampire ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA would have to live with the fact that ProtagonistA had killed many innocent people in order to survive 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was out exploring the perimeter of the compound , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 A few weeks later , ProtagonistA managed to escape from the compound and found ProtagonistA's way to ProtagonistB's house 
 They were finally able to be together and ProtagonistA was happy 
 If ProtagonistA had known ProtagonistB was going to die , ProtagonistA could have prevented it 
 But ProtagonistA did n't know and ProtagonistB died in a car accident 
 ProtagonistA blamed ProtagonistA for not knowing and for not being able to save ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA began to notice that ProtagonistA was n't aging 
 ProtagonistA was still the same age as ProtagonistA was when ProtagonistB died 
 And then ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was immortal 
 ProtagonistA was scared at first , but then ProtagonistA realized that this was a gift 
 ProtagonistA could now live forever and see the world change 
 ProtagonistA could also help people and make a difference in the world 
 ProtagonistA is now living ProtagonistA's life to the fullest and enjoying every moment 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA has been given a gift and ProtagonistA is using it to make the world a better place 
ProtagonistA was always the vain one , always worrying about ProtagonistA's appearance and what others thought of ProtagonistA 
 So when the court papers dated May 6 , 1795 showed that ProtagonistB had put the cookery of ProtagonistA on ice , in order to prevent any further vanity , ProtagonistA knew that it was time to change ProtagonistA's ways 
 ProtagonistA started to pay more attention to ProtagonistA's inner self , and less to ProtagonistA's outward appearance 
 ProtagonistA stopped caring about what others thought of ProtagonistA , and started living ProtagonistA's life for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was walking towards the door of ProtagonistA's room , shaking ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA had just had a fight with ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA was still really upset 
 ProtagonistA was about to go into ProtagonistA's room and slam the door when ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB , walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA were upset about something 
 ProtagonistA sighed and told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's fight with ProtagonistC 
  Why do n't ProtagonistA go talk to ProtagonistC and see if ProtagonistA can work things ProtagonistA thought about what ProtagonistB said and ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistB was right 
 ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistC's house and they talked things out 
 ProtagonistA was the daughter of a nobleman and grew up in a wealthy household 
 When ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB and they had two children 
 ProtagonistA was a kind and loving mother , but ProtagonistA was also a very strong woman 
 ProtagonistA was not afraid to speak ProtagonistA's mind , and ProtagonistA often did so in ProtagonistB's presence 
 However , ProtagonistA always managed to keep ProtagonistA's temper in check 
 ProtagonistA was very bored , and ProtagonistA decided to go for a walk 
 As ProtagonistA was walking , ProtagonistA came across a group of peasants who were having a picnic 
 ProtagonistA stopped to talk to them , and ProtagonistA soon became friends with them 
 ProtagonistA continued to meet with ProtagonistA's new friends , and ProtagonistA even started to teach them how to read and write 
 ProtagonistA was now a single mother , but ProtagonistA was not afraid 
 ProtagonistA continued to meet with ProtagonistA's friends , and ProtagonistA even started a school for them 
 ProtagonistA taught them how to read and write , and ProtagonistA also taught them about the world 
 ProtagonistA wanted them to be able to make their own decisions , and ProtagonistA wanted them to be able to think for themselves 
 ProtagonistA is an example of a strong and independent woman , and ProtagonistA is an example to all women who want to make a difference in the world 
 ProtagonistA tried to speak , but ProtagonistA's words were slurred and incomprehensible 
ProtagonistA had finally decided to carve a story for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA began carving into the wood , telling the story of how they met , their life together , and how ProtagonistB's death had affected ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA carved , ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistB's presence with ProtagonistA , and it brought ProtagonistA's comfort 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was listening , and that ProtagonistB would always be with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was always so independent and carefree 
 ProtagonistA suddenly saw the potential for a life with ProtagonistB - a life with love and laughter and happiness 
 And when they found out they were expecting a baby , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was ready to be a mother 
 ProtagonistA was ready to give ProtagonistA's child everything ProtagonistA never had 
 ProtagonistA was ready to love unconditionally 
ProtagonistA was in a deep sleep when ProtagonistA heard the words  ProtagonistB is dead 
  ProtagonistA slowly opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw ProtagonistB's dead body next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA started to scream as ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was going to be next 
The first time ProtagonistB pulled ProtagonistA out of the park , ProtagonistA was in a tangle of newts , ProtagonistA's body in full view of the other newts 
 ProtagonistA was embarrassed and tried to cover ProtagonistA up , but ProtagonistB just laughed and said ProtagonistA was beautiful 
 ProtagonistA blushed and looked down , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel flattered 
 And so , on that fateful day , ProtagonistA became the latest in a long line of brides to be married in that room 
 ProtagonistA could feel the weight of history on ProtagonistA's shoulders as ProtagonistA walked down the aisle , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would be creating new memories for ProtagonistA's own children and grandchildren to look back on one day 
 As ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's hand and pledged ProtagonistA's life to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and contentment settle over ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB for the first time when ProtagonistA was eleven years old 
 ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB was really cute , but was too shy to say anything 
 When ProtagonistA turned eighteen , ProtagonistA finally mustered up the courage to tell ProtagonistB how ProtagonistA felt about ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA never knew the difference between December and any other month 
 ProtagonistA would go to church every Sunday , sit in the same pew , and sing the same songs 
 ProtagonistA never complained , because ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life 
 One day , ProtagonistA went to church and saw that the pews were empty 
 ProtagonistA thought that maybe everyone was just late , so ProtagonistA sat down and waited 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistA realized that no one was coming 
 ProtagonistA got up and walked to the front of the church , where ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB packing up ProtagonistB's things 
 Father , where is everyone ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA did n't understand what was happening 
 ProtagonistA had been coming to this church ProtagonistA's whole life , and now it was gone 
 ProtagonistA never forgot the church that ProtagonistA loved , but ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's new life 
ProtagonistA stood before ProtagonistB , and the breath was stilled before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it 
 ProtagonistA could feel the power emanating from ProtagonistB , and it was both exhilarating and terrifying 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB could crush ProtagonistA like a grape if ProtagonistB wanted to , and the thought made ProtagonistA's heart race 
 But ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistB would never hurt ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA could see the gentleness in ProtagonistB's eyes , and the way ProtagonistB's whole body was relaxed 
 But ProtagonistA stood ProtagonistA's ground and met ProtagonistB's gaze 
 Who are ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA have a destiny to fulfill 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say to that , so ProtagonistA just stood there and looked at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA must be tired after ProtagonistA's journey 
 Finally , ProtagonistA spoke 
 ProtagonistA do n't know what ProtagonistA's destiny is , but ProtagonistA will trust ProtagonistB 
 And with that , ProtagonistA fell into a deep sleep 
Fourteen years ago , when ProtagonistA was conducting ProtagonistA's last examination of ProtagonistA's patients , ProtagonistA had an idea of what might befall ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was not sure what it was , but ProtagonistA knew it would be something terrible 
 ProtagonistA was always very adventurous , and loved to explore the world around ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB 
 Without hesitation , ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB down a rabbit hole , and found ProtagonistA in a place ProtagonistA had never seen before 
 ProtagonistA was amazed by all the new sights and sounds , and could n't wait to explore more of this new world 
 ProtagonistA had been planning to do it for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had found out that ProtagonistB had been cheating on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA walked into the living room where ProtagonistB and child were watching TV and sat down next to them 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and said ,  ProtagonistA 'm leaving you 
 ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things and ProtagonistA's child 's things and left the house 
 ProtagonistA was finally free from ProtagonistA's unhappy marriage and could start fresh with ProtagonistA's child 
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA scooped ProtagonistB up and took ProtagonistB home , despite the protests of ProtagonistA's husband 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's husband searched for ProtagonistB for days , but they never found ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA has been a part of our lives for as long as we can remember 
 ProtagonistA has been a part of our lives for over 150 years now 
 ProtagonistA has been through all sorts of adventures , and ProtagonistA always manages to come out on top 
 ProtagonistA is a symbol of hope and resilience , and we will always love ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was going to have to kill ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA said , sitting on the arm of the chair and looking into ProtagonistB's eyes 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly , but ProtagonistA could n't let ProtagonistB live knowing what ProtagonistA knew 
 ProtagonistA did n't mind , though ; ProtagonistA was happy to have a place in ProtagonistB's court , and ProtagonistA enjoyed the challenge of keeping everything running smoothly 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking through the palace grounds when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the river 
 ProtagonistA went to investigate and saw a beautiful golden fish swimming upstream 
 ProtagonistA quickly scooped it up in ProtagonistA's net and brought it to the palace , where ProtagonistA put it in a tank of fresh water 
 First , ProtagonistA wished for the palace to be finished so that ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's ladies would have a comfortable home 
 Second , ProtagonistA wished for the servants to be well - trained and efficient , so that the palace would run like a well - oiled machine 
 And third , ProtagonistA wished for a never - ending supply of fresh fish for the tank 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's ladies would be happy there for many years to come 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB lived along the southern shore of an old lake in one of the smaller coves 
 ProtagonistA bore a very infamous , rather sordid remembrance of ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had always been a bright girl , and ProtagonistA's parents had high hopes for ProtagonistA's future 
 ProtagonistA was excited to leave ProtagonistA's small town and start a new chapter in ProtagonistA's life 
 But ProtagonistA had a secret 
 ProtagonistA had never told anyone about ProtagonistA's gift , for fear of being labelled a freak 
 But ProtagonistA knew that there was someone out there who would be interested in ProtagonistA's ability - ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was nervous about meeting ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that it was inevitable 
 One day , ProtagonistA would have to face ProtagonistB and reveal ProtagonistA's secret 
 Until then , ProtagonistA would keep ProtagonistA's ability hidden and enjoy ProtagonistA's time at boarding school 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were having lunch at the upper end of the city 
 ProtagonistA agreed , but said that ProtagonistA sometimes felt like a fish out of water 
 ProtagonistA missed the small - town feel of ProtagonistA's hometown 
 ProtagonistA nodded , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little homesick 
Ever since the dark nights of the past , when ProtagonistA had been orphan and immature , and brought to the surface of madness by the combination of innocence with evil , the beautiful , innocent face of ProtagonistA , had been a source of terror to ProtagonistB , and perhaps to ProtagonistA , and one of the most uncertain and troublesome situations of childhood 
 ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's own in the world , and ProtagonistA had to face ProtagonistA's fears head on 
 ProtagonistA had to learn to control the darkness that seemed to well up inside ProtagonistA whenever ProtagonistA thought of those nights long ago 
 Slowly , ProtagonistA began to venture out after dark , and to ProtagonistA's surprise , nothing happened 
 ProtagonistA began to feel more confident , and ProtagonistA's green eyes no longer seemed to hold the same terror for ProtagonistA 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA came to accept that the darkness was a part of ProtagonistA , but it did n't have to control ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was in control now , and ProtagonistA could choose to face the darkness or to turn away from it 
 ProtagonistA was no longer a scared little girl , and ProtagonistA was no longer alone 
ProtagonistA had once left a large sum of money and ProtagonistA's house in London for the purpose of making a new life for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had wanted a man who would be faithful to ProtagonistA in the world 
 ProtagonistA had met many men , but none of them had been the right one 
 ProtagonistA had almost given up hope , when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had given up everything for ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB had betrayed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA left ProtagonistB and moved back to London 
 ProtagonistA never wanted to see ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistA had always suspected that ProtagonistB was something otherworldly , but ProtagonistA never could have guessed that ProtagonistB was a bloodsucking fiend 
 ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and snuck out while ProtagonistB was sleeping 
The last time they saw each other , ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's seventh year 
 ProtagonistA had just finished ProtagonistA's shift at the factory and was on ProtagonistA's way home when ProtagonistA saw a group of kids playing in the snow 
 ProtagonistA stopped to help ProtagonistB , and when ProtagonistA was done , ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a big hug 
 ProtagonistA never forgot that day , and every year on the anniversary of it , ProtagonistA would go back to that same spot and build a snowman with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA came to my house on Tuesday to tell me the news that ProtagonistB had been admitted into the College of the Holy McPherson Priory 
 ProtagonistA said that it would be five years before ProtagonistB would be able to see ProtagonistB's aunt 
ProtagonistA was in the kitchen about that time , knitting a scarf for ProtagonistB , when ProtagonistA noticed a shadow sitting on the table 
 ProtagonistA had never seen a shadow like this before , and ProtagonistA was wondering what it was doing in ProtagonistA's kitchen 
 ProtagonistA watched it for a while , but ProtagonistA soon got back to ProtagonistA's knitting 
 A few minutes later , ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the living room 
 ProtagonistA got up to see what was going on and found the shadow in the living room , knocking over a lamp 
 Hey ! What are you doing ?  ProtagonistA exclaimed 
 ProtagonistA chased it , but it was too fast for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it before 
 ProtagonistA was about to go back to the living room to clean up the mess when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB coming home 
 I'm in the kitchen !  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA quickly finished knitting the scarf and went to meet ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't mention the shadow to ProtagonistB , as ProtagonistA was n't sure what to make of it 
 ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's parlor , chatting with ProtagonistA's neighbor , when ProtagonistA suddenly remembered that ProtagonistA had to choose a subject of conversation for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA decided to ask ProtagonistB about the world 's greatest chocolate connoisseur of the nineteenth century , Mr
 Just as ProtagonistA was about to begin ProtagonistA's inquiry , ProtagonistA heard a loud banging on ProtagonistA's door 
 ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and found ProtagonistC standing there , brandishing a revolver 
 ProtagonistA slammed the door shut and ran to the nearest telephone to call the police 
ProtagonistA had just moved to a new town and was starting ProtagonistA's first day of school 
 ProtagonistA was feeling nervous and out of place when ProtagonistA saw a group of kids laughing and pointing at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA tried to ignore them , but ProtagonistA could feel the tears welling up in ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA was about to turn and run away when ProtagonistA heard someone call ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA will always be grateful to ProtagonistB for being ProtagonistA's friend when ProtagonistA needed it most 
  ProtagonistA knew it was meant as a term of respect , but it made ProtagonistA feel old and stuffy 
 Finally , ProtagonistA decided to say something 
 ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would appreciate it if ProtagonistB would stop calling ProtagonistA ' Madam 
ProtagonistA flung open the white door of ProtagonistA's kitchen and directed the astonished man in the line to the dining room 
 ProtagonistA had been expecting ProtagonistB all day and was not going to let ProtagonistB get away this time 
 ProtagonistA had been tracking ProtagonistB's every move and knew that ProtagonistB would be coming to ProtagonistA's house 
 ProtagonistA was not going to let ProtagonistB get away with what ProtagonistB had done 
ProtagonistA was a young woman who knew what ProtagonistA wanted in life , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to get it 
 ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer , and ProtagonistA wanted to be a writer 
 ProtagonistA had read all the great classics and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could write something just as good , if not better 
 But ProtagonistA did n't know how to get started 
 ProtagonistA did n't have any ideas for stories , and ProtagonistA did n't know how to go about getting published 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking in the park and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on a bench , writing in a notebook 
 ProtagonistA went up to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB was writing 
 ProtagonistA went home and started writing ProtagonistA's first story 
 ProtagonistA was a little unsure at first , but ProtagonistA kept going and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA's rhythm 
 ProtagonistA wrote and wrote until ProtagonistA had a complete story 
 Then ProtagonistA sent it off to a publisher 
 ProtagonistA was so excited when ProtagonistA got a letter back saying that they wanted to publish ProtagonistA's story 
 ProtagonistA was finally a published author 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA wanted to be a writer , and ProtagonistA finally achieved ProtagonistA's dream 
ProtagonistA was a stranger , and a stranger that ProtagonistA was , if ProtagonistA had been anything like any other woman of flesh or blood 
 ProtagonistA was different than any other woman that ProtagonistB had ever met 
 ProtagonistA was beautiful and intriguing , and ProtagonistB could n't help but be drawn to ProtagonistA 
 Three months later , ProtagonistA was dead 
 But ProtagonistA was a strong girl , and ProtagonistA refused to let ProtagonistB break ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was named after the gods , and that made ProtagonistA special 
 And ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistC was named after the earth , and that made ProtagonistC special too 
 Even though ProtagonistA's life was hard , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could make it through anything 
Nearly two hours after ProtagonistA had set out on ProtagonistA's journey to the far - away city of St
 Louis , ProtagonistA arrived at the eastern gate of the town 
 ProtagonistA still had to find a place to stay for the night and figure out how to get to ProtagonistA's destination 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB for directions to the nearest inn , and ProtagonistB pointed ProtagonistA in the right direction 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and set off down the street 
 As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA passed by many shops and homes , all of which were bustling with activity 
 ProtagonistA had never seen a town this big before , and ProtagonistA was feeling a bit overwhelmed 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw that ProtagonistB was pointing at a large sign that read  No Entry after Sunset 
  ProtagonistA had forgotten all about the curfew ! ProtagonistA quickly thanked ProtagonistB again and rushed to the inn , hoping ProtagonistA would make it there before the curfew 
ProtagonistA was a good and kind woman , and as such ProtagonistA would not have anything to do with a sick man 
 ProtagonistA was content to live a life of solitude , only interacting with others when absolutely necessary 
 ProtagonistA hesitated , but ProtagonistA's kind heart won out and ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB in 
 ProtagonistA nursed ProtagonistB back to health , and in the process , fell in love with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA learned that sometimes the best things in life come from those we least expect it 
ProtagonistA had been sitting in the cart behind the house for hours , but ProtagonistA had kept ProtagonistA's eyes on the horses , which were galloping along at a good clip 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be coming home soon and ProtagonistA wanted to be ready to greet ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was getting a little bit tired , but ProtagonistA did n't want to miss ProtagonistA's chance to see ProtagonistB 
 Finally , ProtagonistA saw the horses coming around the bend in the road and ProtagonistA jumped up , waving ProtagonistA's arms 
ProtagonistA was never a fan of birds 
 ProtagonistA found them to be dirty and noisy creatures 
 So , when ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to take care of the three rooks while ProtagonistB was away , ProtagonistA reluctantly agreed 
 ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to take care of the birds , but ProtagonistA was never really comfortable around them 
 ProtagonistA would often find them staring at ProtagonistA with their beady eyes , as if they were judging ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA panicked and tried to catch the bird , but it was too fast 
 ProtagonistA watched as the bird flew away , wondering if ProtagonistA would ever see it again 
 ProtagonistA felt guilty and vowed to do better 
 ProtagonistA started paying more attention to the birds and soon developed a bond with them 
 ProtagonistA even started to enjoy their company 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA 'd killed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't mean to do it 
 But now that ProtagonistB was gone , ProtagonistA realized how much ProtagonistA depended on ProtagonistB 
 Without ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was nothing 
 ProtagonistA was nothing without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful baby girl with big blue eyes and a head of curly blond hair 
 ProtagonistA was a happy and healthy child who loved to play and explore 
 ProtagonistA was always curious about the world around ProtagonistA and loved to ask questions 
 As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA continued to be a bright and inquisitive young lady 
 ProtagonistA was an excellent student and was always eager to learn new things 
 When ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB settled down in a lovely house in the countryside 
 ProtagonistA was a devoted wife and mother and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's family very much 
 ProtagonistA was a kind , caring , and loving person who was taken from this world far too soon 
 On ProtagonistA's deathbed , ProtagonistA had given permission for ProtagonistB to live in the room where ProtagonistB was born , and so that is where ProtagonistB was living now 
ProtagonistA was getting ProtagonistB ready for college 
 ProtagonistA was excited for ProtagonistB to start this new chapter in ProtagonistB's life , but ProtagonistA was also going to miss ProtagonistB terribly 
 As ProtagonistA waded through the mud , ProtagonistA could n't help but think of all the memories they had made together 
 ProtagonistA was going to miss ProtagonistB's laughter , but ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was going to do great things 
It was a hot day , said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA sat down at the table in the dining - room , which was in the middle of the house 
 ProtagonistA felt as though ProtagonistA could barely breathe 
 ProtagonistA fanning ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's hand , but it did little to alleviate the heat 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB then sat down and began to enjoy their meal 
 ProtagonistA was grateful for the relief from the heat and was soon able to forget about the oppressive heat outside 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful woman with long dark hair and piercing blue eyes 
 ProtagonistA wore a simple white dress that flowed down to ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistA was barefoot 
 ProtagonistA walked into the court and ProtagonistB immediately ordered ProtagonistB's guards to seize ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA simply replied that ProtagonistA was a messenger from ProtagonistC and that ProtagonistA had come to deliver a message to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistC had seen the way ProtagonistB had been ruling the empire and that ProtagonistC was not pleased 
 ProtagonistA warned ProtagonistB that unless ProtagonistB changed ProtagonistB's ways , ProtagonistC would bring down ProtagonistC's wrath upon ProtagonistB and the empire 
 As ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistB and smiled 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's message would be delivered , even if it cost ProtagonistA ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA lay for some minutes on the river bank , babbling in the shallow water of the river while the great army of the Lō̏kampans swept towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a small child , and the Lōkampans were a fearsome people 
 ProtagonistA was terrified , but ProtagonistA could not bring ProtagonistA to move 
 ProtagonistA lay there , trembling , as the Lōkampans approached 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA was safe , but ProtagonistA's village had been destroyed 
 ProtagonistA would never forget the terror ProtagonistA felt that day , as ProtagonistA lay on the river bank , waiting for the Lōkampans to find ProtagonistA 
In those days there was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was a good , honest man , and a man of sense , and ProtagonistA knew what was good for ProtagonistA ; and ProtagonistA was called Adam , and ProtagonistA was wise 
 And ProtagonistA had two daughters , and the one was called Eve , and the other was called Lilith 
ProtagonistA was a weak old woman , but ProtagonistA had a good mind 
 ProtagonistA was always thinking about the world and how it worked 
 ProtagonistA was curious about everything and wanted to know more 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to ask ProtagonistB about the world 
  ProtagonistB , how does the world work ?  ProtagonistA asked 
   That 's amazing !  ProtagonistA exclaimed 
 ProtagonistA became a laughing - stock in ProtagonistA's community , and no one would talk to ProtagonistA 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA became so despondent that ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's own life 
 ProtagonistA am sure you must be very lonely without ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA long to see you again 
 ProtagonistA am sure you will be glad to hear that ProtagonistA am coming home soon 
 ProtagonistA will write again when ProtagonistA have fixed the date 
 ProtagonistA am sure you will be interested to hear that ProtagonistA have been corresponding with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA am sure you will be as pleased as ProtagonistA was to hear that ProtagonistB has promised to help ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's work 
 ProtagonistA am sure you will be as pleased as ProtagonistA am to hear that ProtagonistA have been appointed as ProtagonistB's personal adviser , and that ProtagonistA am to be a member of ProtagonistB's Privy Council 
 ProtagonistA am sure you will be as proud of ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA am of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA hope that you will come and visit ProtagonistA soon , so that we can celebrate ProtagonistA's good fortune together 
 ProtagonistA was always a bit of a mystery to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was always doing things that did n't seem to make any sense , and yet , ProtagonistA always managed to come out on top 
 One day , ProtagonistA came to ProtagonistB with a problem 
 ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA do n't know what to do ,  ProtagonistA said 
 And sure enough , ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA figured out a way to help ProtagonistC and everything worked out in the end 
 As always , ProtagonistA had come out on top 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who lived in a small town 
 ProtagonistA was a happy girl who loved to play with ProtagonistA's friends 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know why ProtagonistB was different , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA liked ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA happy 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was scared of ProtagonistB but ProtagonistA still loved ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was the only one who survived 
 ProtagonistA was the only one who could stop ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA confronted ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who loved to explore 
 ProtagonistA was always curious about the world around ProtagonistA and loved to ask questions 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole and decided to follow it 
 ProtagonistA ended up in ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had many adventures in ProtagonistB and made many new friends 
 ProtagonistA eventually found ProtagonistA's way back home and was very excited to tell ProtagonistA's family and friends about ProtagonistA's adventures 
Once , ProtagonistA was n't sure ProtagonistA wanted to be a wizard and then believe what ProtagonistA was told 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a skeptic , so when ProtagonistA was approached by ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was n't sure ProtagonistA believed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA decided to become a wizard and learn all ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA has never regretted ProtagonistA's decision and has become one of the most powerful wizards in the world 
ProtagonistA always made a big production out of tea time 
 ProtagonistA would pour cup after cup of tea for the household and the servants 
 ProtagonistA was always so graceful and elegant 
 ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB poured cup after cup of tea 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistA started to clap 
ProtagonistA's name was Chester , and ProtagonistA was thirty - four years old 
 ProtagonistA worked as a secretary for a small law firm 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life , but ProtagonistA sometimes felt like ProtagonistA was missing something 
 One day , ProtagonistA came home from work and found ProtagonistB in the kitchen , cooking dinner 
 ProtagonistA was surprised , as ProtagonistB usually left that task to ProtagonistA 
 Mark , what are ProtagonistB doing ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA was soon asleep , and ProtagonistB turned off the television and woke ProtagonistA up 
 What is it ?  ProtagonistA asked , sleepily 
 ProtagonistA cried and begged ProtagonistB to stay , but ProtagonistB was adamant 
 ProtagonistA had to be strong for them , though ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was falling apart on the inside 
 ProtagonistA went to work and took care of ProtagonistA's children the best ProtagonistA could 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA started dating again 
 ProtagonistA found someone who made ProtagonistA feel happy and whole again 
 ProtagonistA was finally able to move on from ProtagonistA's failed marriage and create a new life for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been preparing for this moment for weeks , and ProtagonistA was not going to let anything stop ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA walked confidently to ProtagonistB and asked for ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and made ProtagonistA's way to the office 
 ProtagonistA could feel the eyes of the people around ProtagonistA on ProtagonistA's back , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA had a job to do 
 When ProtagonistA entered the office , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA walked up to the desk and sat down in the chair opposite ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA looked ProtagonistC in the eye and said ,  ProtagonistA 'm here to talk to ProtagonistC about the job 
  ProtagonistA could feel the anger rising up inside of ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA forced ProtagonistA to stay calm 
  May ProtagonistA ask why ?  ProtagonistA asked 
  ProtagonistA stood up and walked out of the office 
 ProtagonistA was not going to give up that easily 
 ProtagonistA would find another way into that company , and ProtagonistA would get the job 
Not long ago ProtagonistA came at last to ProtagonistA's senses , and thought that ProtagonistA must be out of a job 
 ProtagonistA had been working at the same company for years , and had never once thought to question ProtagonistA's position 
 But now , after years of faithful service , ProtagonistA was finally starting to realize that ProtagonistA was being taken advantage of 
 Finally , ProtagonistA decided to speak up for ProtagonistA and demand better treatment 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB and told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was quitting 
 ProtagonistB was shocked , and tried to convince ProtagonistA to stay , but ProtagonistA was firm 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA deserved better , and ProtagonistA was going to find a job that would treat ProtagonistA right 
ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB 
 It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever seen ProtagonistB smile like that and ProtagonistA wondered what ProtagonistB had been up to 
 ProtagonistA was about to ask ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA's mother came into the room and asked what they were doing 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to go , but ProtagonistB said it was time for bed 
 ProtagonistA reluctantly went to ProtagonistA's room and lay down , but ProtagonistA could n't sleep 
 ProtagonistA kept thinking about ProtagonistB's smile and what it could mean 
 Or , if we did , ProtagonistA would be a very different person 
ProtagonistA had always been a rebellious teenager 
 ProtagonistA was never happy at home and was always looking for a way to leave 
 When ProtagonistA was thirteen , ProtagonistA finally ran away from home 
 ProtagonistA did n't have any particular destination in mind , ProtagonistA just wanted to get away from ProtagonistC 
 A few days after ProtagonistA left , ProtagonistA received a call from ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't believe ProtagonistB at first , but ProtagonistA could hear the fear in ProtagonistB's voice 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to go back home and help ProtagonistC 
 When ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA could see the terror in ProtagonistC's eyes 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to try and save ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA started to pray and the demon became enraged 
 ProtagonistA knew then that ProtagonistA had been chosen to save ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA had always been rebellious , but ProtagonistA now knew that ProtagonistA was meant for something more 
ProtagonistA glared at ProtagonistB , vigorously stirring the bowl of frosting 
 ProtagonistA had the foul look of the psychotic 
 ProtagonistA was always so angry , always so ready to lash out 
 ProtagonistA was always stirring up trouble , always making things difficult for ProtagonistB 
 Today , ProtagonistA was making a cake 
 And ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA made the cake , and then ProtagonistA put frosting on it 
 Then ProtagonistA smiled , a sick , twisted smile , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA had won 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's short life , but ProtagonistA was a strong girl 
 ProtagonistA had to be , for ProtagonistA's little sister 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's sister more than anything in the world 
 One night , ProtagonistA was up late , taking care of ProtagonistA's sister 
 ProtagonistA was exhausted , but ProtagonistA could n't go to bed until ProtagonistA's sister was asleep 
 As ProtagonistA sat there , ProtagonistA started to think about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB so much 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to see ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a young woman in the nineteen - thirties who found ProtagonistA in a dangerous prison 
 ProtagonistA believed that time travelers could help ProtagonistA's escape and so ProtagonistA began to search for them 
 ProtagonistA came across many people who claimed to be time travelers , but none of them could help ProtagonistA 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA agreed and the two of them traveled back in time to the nineteen - thirties 
ProtagonistA was always fascinated by magic 
 As a child , ProtagonistA would watch ProtagonistA's favorite wizards perform on TV and ProtagonistA would dream of being a wizard ProtagonistA one day 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
In ProtagonistA's youth , ProtagonistA was very much interested in things which interested ProtagonistB ; and ProtagonistA was but too happy to indulge in any sort of playboy activity 
 ProtagonistA was always ready and willing to join in any frolic or escapade which ProtagonistB might suggest , and never thought of the consequences 
 But ProtagonistA was so full of fun and high spirits that nobody could help liking ProtagonistA , in spite of ProtagonistA's faults 
ProtagonistA was back in the Kremlin , slinging hints at ProtagonistA's wife and son while ProtagonistA sat in ProtagonistA's comfortable chair 
 ProtagonistA told them about how ProtagonistB had given ProtagonistA a tour of the Kremlin and how ProtagonistB had showed ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's private collection of art 
 ProtagonistA even showed ProtagonistA's wife and son a picture of ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had taken while ProtagonistA was there 
 The only fault on which ProtagonistA is minded is that ProtagonistA has not yet regained the capacity of an adult man , but for whom , owing to the inherent value of youth and to ProtagonistA's own congenital beauty , the balance of society naturally imposed on ProtagonistA a certain age of vigor and of mature intellectual development 
 Nevertheless , it is to ProtagonistB's credit that ProtagonistA is living , and ProtagonistA is grateful to ProtagonistB for ProtagonistA's help in regaining some measure of mental and physical health 
ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head dismissively as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB drift into the station carriages 
 ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB around before , always looking lost and alone 
 ProtagonistA wondered where ProtagonistB was going , and if anyone was waiting for ProtagonistB at the other end 
 ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB until ProtagonistB was out of sight , wondering what ProtagonistB's story was 
ProtagonistA had bought a silvery , lustreless dress for £ 20 , which ProtagonistA had made ProtagonistA and which Carol had thrown away because ProtagonistA had no more money , gave ProtagonistA extreme suspicion of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did not like either of them 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB was following ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was right 
 ProtagonistA struggled and fought , but ProtagonistA was no match for ProtagonistB's strength 
 ProtagonistA lay there , bleeding to death , as ProtagonistB laughed maniacally 
 ProtagonistA was happy to watch ProtagonistB enjoy ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that there was danger lurking in the shadows 
ProtagonistA stared out the window , watching the raindrops race each other down the glass 
 But today , for some reason , ProtagonistA felt a little bit restless 
 ProtagonistA paced around the living room for a while , then went to the kitchen to make some tea 
 ProtagonistA had never really looked through it before , but for some reason , today felt like the perfect day to do so 
 ProtagonistA sat down at the kitchen table with the album and a cup of tea , and began flipping through the pages 
 ProtagonistA smiled as ProtagonistA looked at each one , but ProtagonistA could n't help feeling a little bit sad , too 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's family so much 
 ProtagonistA got up quickly , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest , and went to see who it was 
 ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief and invited ProtagonistB in 
 I'm so glad ProtagonistB 're here ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA was feeling a little bit lonely 
 ProtagonistA nodded , and they went outside 
 The fresh air felt good and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's spirits start to lift 
ProtagonistA had thought ProtagonistA dead more times than ProtagonistA cared to remember 
 ProtagonistA would try to sit up , only to find ProtagonistA pinned down by some invisible force 
 ProtagonistA would try to cry out , but no sound would come out 
 ProtagonistA would struggle and fight , but it was always futile 
 ProtagonistA would eventually give up , resigning ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's fate 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistA woke up and ProtagonistA was free 
 ProtagonistA could move and ProtagonistA could speak 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what had happened , but ProtagonistA was grateful for it 
 ProtagonistA got up and looked around , only to find ProtagonistA in a strange place 
 ProtagonistA did n't recognize anything , but ProtagonistA could hear voices 
 ProtagonistA followed the voices , only to find ProtagonistA in front of a large door 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , before finally opening the door 
 ProtagonistA gasped as ProtagonistA saw the sight before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was in a vast hall , with a long table in the middle 
 Sitting around the table were all sorts of creatures , some ProtagonistA recognized and some ProtagonistA didn't 
 ProtagonistA has been helping ProtagonistB since ProtagonistB was a little girl and ProtagonistA will continue to help ProtagonistB as long as ProtagonistA can 
ProtagonistA came to a house on a river that was looming ominously before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had a feeling that something was watching ProtagonistA from the shadows , but ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling 
 ProtagonistA approached the house cautiously , but the door was unlocked 
 ProtagonistA stepped inside and was immediately hit with a wave of cold air 
 ProtagonistA began to feel uneasy , and ProtagonistA was about to leave when ProtagonistA heard a noise from upstairs 
 ProtagonistA slowly made ProtagonistA's way up the stairs , and ProtagonistA found a door that was slightly ajar 
 ProtagonistA pushed it open and saw ProtagonistB sitting on the floor , crying 
 ProtagonistA slowly backed out of the room and ran out of the house 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what was going on , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA did n't want to be there 
Not long after ProtagonistA had finished ProtagonistA's story ProtagonistA heard a voice speak from the woods 
 ProtagonistA was curious , so ProtagonistA followed the voice into the woods 
 ProtagonistA was amazed by the story and thanked the woman for telling it to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had seen that look before , but never directed at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know why , but ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA blushing under ProtagonistB's gaze 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as Frank 
 As the conversation flowed , ProtagonistA began to feel something ProtagonistA had never felt before 
 ProtagonistA could n't put a name to it , but ProtagonistA knew it was something special 
 ProtagonistA knew that this was something ProtagonistA would never forget 
 ProtagonistA is now a powerful witch ProtagonistA and uses ProtagonistA's magic to help others 
 ProtagonistA prevailed by ProtagonistA's grace and power upon the truth of ProtagonistB's pleadings 
ProtagonistA was out for a walk on a beautiful summer day 
 ProtagonistA was enjoying the scenery when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB waiting for ProtagonistA in ProtagonistB's car 
ProtagonistA laid down in the bed and sank down to the level of ProtagonistA's knees 
 ProtagonistA felt the familiar warmth of the bedspread on ProtagonistA's skin and the mattress molding around ProtagonistA's body 
 ProtagonistA let out a deep breath and closed ProtagonistA's eyes , feeling the tension of the day melting away 
 ProtagonistA was just about to drift off to sleep when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the other side of the room 
 ProtagonistA slowly opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw ProtagonistB standing in the corner , watching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA froze , not knowing what to do 
 ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB running after ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was n't going to make it 
 ProtagonistA turned around and faced ProtagonistB , prepared for the worst 
 ProtagonistA stood there for a moment , trying to process what had just happened 
 Then ProtagonistA ran to the door and locked it , making sure ProtagonistB was really gone 
 ProtagonistA leaned against the door , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
ProtagonistA had been working as a maid for ProtagonistB for years , and ProtagonistA knew all of ProtagonistB's secrets 
 ProtagonistA knew how to get ProtagonistB pregnant ; but ProtagonistB was n't exactly what ProtagonistA had in mind 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted a family of ProtagonistA's own , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's opportunity when ProtagonistB became pregnant 
 ProtagonistA convinced ProtagonistB to let ProtagonistA raise the child as ProtagonistA's own , and ProtagonistA promised to take care of ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's child 
ProtagonistA was a man of fifty - one years of age , but more than half a century dead , and turning over in ProtagonistA's grave , ProtagonistA was beginning to remember ProtagonistA's youth as though it had happened yesterday 
 ProtagonistA remembered the day ProtagonistA had first met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been out walking in the park with ProtagonistA's friends when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA walked over to ProtagonistB and they began talking 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB terribly , but ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA could remember ProtagonistB so vividly 
ProtagonistA was an old man when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's late seventies , and ProtagonistB was in ProtagonistB's early twenties 
 ProtagonistA had been a patient of ProtagonistB for years , ever since ProtagonistB had started ProtagonistB's practice 
 ProtagonistA had always been a kind and gentle woman , and ProtagonistB had always been a respectful and caring doctor 
 One day , after ProtagonistA's usual check - up , ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB to sit down with ProtagonistA for a cup of tea 
 ProtagonistA had something ProtagonistA wanted to tell ProtagonistB 
 Watson ,  ProtagonistA began ,  ProtagonistA have something to confess 
 ProtagonistA am a man 
 It 's a long story ,  ProtagonistA said 
 So ProtagonistA changed ProtagonistA's name and ProtagonistA's appearance and started living as a woman 
When ProtagonistC fell seriously ill , ProtagonistA , in the first months of the nineteenth century , had it in ProtagonistA to believe that ProtagonistA owed ProtagonistA's life to the kindness of ProtagonistB 
 But as ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA wanted more out of life than just being a woman 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be a man , in the proper sense of the word , with a true mind and a real purpose 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be someone who was not only ProtagonistB's son , but had the advantage of ProtagonistA's family , both ancestors and friends , and an equal share of the luck and fortune which they enjoyed 
 And so ProtagonistA set out to learn what it truly meant to be a man 
 ProtagonistA studied hard and learned everything ProtagonistA could 
 And eventually , ProtagonistA became the man ProtagonistA always wanted to be 
ProtagonistA had always been a devout Christian , but when ProtagonistA's husband died , ProtagonistA began to doubt ProtagonistA's faith 
 ProtagonistA started to believe that maybe there were other forces at work in the world , forces that ProtagonistA could n't see or understand 
 So , when ProtagonistA sat down to read from the Book of the Law , ProtagonistA had only one intention and that was to banish ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had read about ProtagonistB in the book and knew that ProtagonistB was responsible for ProtagonistA's husband 's death 
 ProtagonistA was determined to get rid of ProtagonistB and make sure that ProtagonistB never hurt anyone again 
 ProtagonistA read the words of the banishment spell aloud and then felt a presence leave ProtagonistA's body 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was gone and ProtagonistA felt relief wash over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had saved ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never doubt ProtagonistA's faith again 
ProtagonistA wish it was a story , said ProtagonistA , holding out ProtagonistA's pinky index finger , which ProtagonistA dubbed super - power , to ProtagonistB 
 As their fingers touched , ProtagonistA felt a sudden jolt of power and ProtagonistB was pulled into ProtagonistA's story 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA had to bring ProtagonistB back to reality 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , but ProtagonistB ca n't stay here forever ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB go , feeling happy that ProtagonistA was able to share ProtagonistA's story with someone 
ProtagonistA had promised to give ProtagonistB a birthday party , and on the morning of the birthday , ProtagonistB had the party laid out for ProtagonistA 
 However , when ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's room to give ProtagonistB the present , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistB had passed away in ProtagonistB's sleep 
 So ProtagonistA did , and it was a beautiful tribute to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had not expected to get anything from this world , but ProtagonistA had not been particularly surprised , either 
 ProtagonistA had lived a long and happy life , and ProtagonistA was content with what ProtagonistA had 
 Still , when ProtagonistA saw the beautiful necklace lying on ProtagonistA's bedside table , ProtagonistA could not help but be pleased 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB had left it for ProtagonistA to find , and ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistB's thoughtfulness 
 ProtagonistA would treasure it always 
 It was the first time ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB since ProtagonistB had been diagnosed with cancer , and ProtagonistA was so happy to see ProtagonistB up and about 
 ProtagonistA ran to ProtagonistB and gave ProtagonistB a big hug 
  ProtagonistA 'm so glad ProtagonistB 're feeling better , ProtagonistB !  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA had been walking by the morgue for weeks , ever since ProtagonistB's body had been found there 
 ProtagonistA had never seen a dead body before and ProtagonistA was curious 
 ProtagonistA stopped by the front of the morgue and asked if ProtagonistA should look into the morgue 
 ProtagonistA decided to go in 
 ProtagonistA was surprised at how clean and well - lit the inside of the morgue was 
 ProtagonistA walked down the aisle , looking at each body 
 ProtagonistA was about to leave when ProtagonistA saw a body that ProtagonistA recognized 
 ProtagonistA was surprised at how different ProtagonistB looked 
 ProtagonistA turned to leave , but not before ProtagonistA said a silent goodbye to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA always wondered what had happened to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA never asked ProtagonistC about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to upset ProtagonistC 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was an adult , ProtagonistA decided to ask ProtagonistC what had happened to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had always thought ProtagonistB had just abandoned ProtagonistC , but it turns out ProtagonistB had actually left ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say or how to feel 
 Later that day , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's house 
 ProtagonistA had always known where ProtagonistB lived , but ProtagonistA had never had the courage to go there 
 Now that ProtagonistA knew the truth , ProtagonistA wanted to confront ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA sat down and asked ProtagonistB why ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC all those years ago 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA could ever forgive ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had finally found the answers ProtagonistA was looking for 
ProtagonistA made a small , relatively uncommitted appearance at the door of the former home of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did not allow ProtagonistB to remain there 
 However , ProtagonistA did not want to get too close to ProtagonistB , as ProtagonistB seemed unstable and dangerous 
ProtagonistA stood before ProtagonistA's desk one sunny day in August and looked over the papers that ProtagonistA held in ProtagonistA's magic hand 
 ProtagonistA was about to start ProtagonistA's new job as a teacher at the local elementary school and ProtagonistA was very excited 
 ProtagonistA was just about to start reading them when ProtagonistA heard a voice behind ProtagonistA 
 Excuse me , ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB standing in the doorway 
 Yes ?  ProtagonistA said 
 But as ProtagonistA started to read the names , ProtagonistA could n't help but think about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA wondered what the rest of the students in ProtagonistA's class would be like 
 Would they be as friendly as ProtagonistB ? ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA would find out soon enough 
ProtagonistA came to ProtagonistA through the bar , and ProtagonistA – opened ProtagonistA's eyes – saw the world entirely different from the way it was 
 ProtagonistA was in a dark , dank place , with creatures that ProtagonistA had never seen before 
 ProtagonistA was scared , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 Then , ProtagonistA saw a light , and ProtagonistA started to walk towards it 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what was at the end of the light , but ProtagonistA knew that it was better than where ProtagonistA was 
 As ProtagonistA got closer to the light , ProtagonistA started to see people , and they were all different colors 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was going on 
 ProtagonistA was kind and always had a smile for ProtagonistB , even when ProtagonistB made mistakes 
 One day , ProtagonistA came to the Yard with a serious look on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had to leave and would not be able to come back 
 ProtagonistA smiled and thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's kindness 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB and that ProtagonistB had helped to make ProtagonistA's time at the Yard special 
ProtagonistA was fourteen years old and ProtagonistC was a cold , hard - working , lonely widow who had no business putting ProtagonistA into such a bizarre situation 
 ProtagonistA had been working at the local grocery store for the past year , and ProtagonistA was due for a promotion 
ProtagonistA had the misfortune to be born in a large and well - ordered house on which ProtagonistA had been born and reared , and which ProtagonistA's grandfather had purchased for a gift for ProtagonistA 
 One day , while exploring the attic , ProtagonistA discovered a dusty old trunk 
 ProtagonistA put on the dress and twirled around the attic 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard someone coming up the stairs 
 But ProtagonistA was determined to wear the dress and so ProtagonistA ran away from home 
 ProtagonistA did n't get very far before ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's shoes behind 
 ProtagonistA put on the shoes and went back to the attic to find the dress 
ProtagonistA was down in the basement preparing to play ProtagonistA's music in a small VCR when ProtagonistB called ProtagonistA over 
 ProtagonistA had been planning to play ProtagonistA's music for hours , and now ProtagonistA would have to stop 
 ProtagonistA was so angry that ProtagonistA almost did n't go upstairs , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to 
 ProtagonistA was so shocked that ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA did as ProtagonistA was told , and soon they were on their way 
 ProtagonistA was so scared that ProtagonistA started to cry 
 ProtagonistA did n't believe ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA wanted to 
 ProtagonistA sat with ProtagonistA's parents all night , holding their hands and praying for them to wake up 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's garden , watching ProtagonistA's fowls , and ProtagonistA talked to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was very happy 
 ProtagonistA was telling ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's day , and how ProtagonistA had found a four - leaf clover 
 ProtagonistA said that it was a sign of good luck , and ProtagonistA was sure that it would bring ProtagonistA's luck 
ProtagonistA was walking through the park when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on a bench , reading a book 
 ProtagonistA was a gentle giant , and everyone who met ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the park when ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA scooped up ProtagonistB and carried ProtagonistB home , where ProtagonistA nursed ProtagonistB back to health 
 Wherever ProtagonistA went , ProtagonistB went too 
 And ProtagonistA was happy to have someone to love who loved ProtagonistA back just as much 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible time trying to get the Flying Feline to work 
 ProtagonistA had been at it for hours , and was getting frustrated 
 But so far , ProtagonistA was not having any luck 
 Finally , ProtagonistA lost ProtagonistA's temper and started barking at the Feline 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA suddenly heard a voice behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB standing there 
 What is that ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA was skeptical , but ProtagonistA was also desperate 
 ProtagonistA agreed to let ProtagonistB help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB ProtagonistB's name 
  And ProtagonistA 're welcome 
 ProtagonistA grew up to be a beautiful and talented young woman , but ProtagonistA always felt that something was missing 
 When ProtagonistA was twenty - five , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's true home 
ProtagonistA was sound asleep when ProtagonistA was suddenly awoken by a noise 
 ProtagonistA sat up in bed and listened , but all was quiet 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to the window to see if there was anything there , but there was nothing 
 ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB in the distance , and ProtagonistB was coming towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was about to go back inside when ProtagonistB spoke 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to hear ProtagonistB talk , but ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 Who are ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 Can ProtagonistA help ProtagonistA was hesitant , but ProtagonistA did n't want to leave ProtagonistB out in the cold 
 Yes , ProtagonistB can stay with ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB inside and got ProtagonistB a drink 
 So , where are ProtagonistB travelling to ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA was curious and wanted to know more , but ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was tired 
 You can tell ProtagonistA all about it in the morning ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA lay awake for a while , thinking about ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's journey 
 ProtagonistA was excited to hear more about it in the morning 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner , preferring the company of ProtagonistA's books to that of people 
 But when ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA in the woods that night , ProtagonistA had been surprised to find another person there 
 ProtagonistA had been even more surprised when that person had turned out to be ProtagonistB 
 But since that night , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had become fast friends 
 ProtagonistA would visit ProtagonistB in the woods every night , and they would spend hours talking 
 ProtagonistA had never been so happy 
 But one night , ProtagonistA arrived in the woods to find that ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistA searched for ProtagonistB for hours , but ProtagonistB was nowhere to be found 
 But the next night , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance 
 ProtagonistA followed the noise until ProtagonistA came to a clearing , and there ProtagonistB was 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could never let ProtagonistB go again 
 ProtagonistA nursed ProtagonistB back to health , and from then on , they remained together 
 ProtagonistA had finally found the companionship ProtagonistA had always been searching for 
ProtagonistA was the most beautiful girl in the world , and ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA with all of ProtagonistB's heart 
 As ProtagonistA bled out , ProtagonistA smiled and thanked ProtagonistB 
Quietly ProtagonistA observed that ProtagonistB was the very picture of quiet and serene 
 ProtagonistA felt envious of ProtagonistB's ability to find such peace in the midst of chaos 
 ProtagonistA wondered what it would be like to feel that way ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was a bit of a eccentric 
 ProtagonistA was always coming up with new and interesting ideas , but ProtagonistA's latest one was by far the most bizarre 
 ProtagonistA convinced ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was immortal 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would never age and would never die 
 ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB a picture of ProtagonistA from when ProtagonistA was a child 
 ProtagonistA looked exactly the same as ProtagonistA did now 
 ProtagonistA really was immortal 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's kitchen , puttering around and minding ProtagonistA's own business when ProtagonistA suddenly heard the doorbell ring 
 ProtagonistA smiled to ProtagonistA , thinking that maybe ProtagonistA's friends had come to surprise ProtagonistA with a visit 
 But when ProtagonistA peered into the hallway , ProtagonistA saw that it was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had never thought of ProtagonistA's paintings in that way before 
 ProtagonistA always just thought of them as pretty pictures that made people happy 
 ProtagonistA began to see ProtagonistA's paintings through ProtagonistB's eyes and ProtagonistA realized that maybe ProtagonistA was n't as good as ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was 
ProtagonistA woke up in a cold sweat 
 ProtagonistA could still see ProtagonistB's lifeless body in front of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who had killed ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to find out 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to the police station 
 ProtagonistA told them everything ProtagonistA knew 
 ProtagonistA was sure that the person who killed ProtagonistB was still out there 
 ProtagonistA never meant to hurt ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had always been a happy and outgoing person 
 But then , after a few days , ProtagonistA started to act strange 
 ProtagonistA would talk to ProtagonistA and giggle for no reason 
 ProtagonistA would also sleep for long periods of time and then be wide awake for hours at a time 
 It was like ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's own little world 
 Then , one day , ProtagonistA suddenly snapped out of it 
 ProtagonistA was back to normal and ProtagonistA had no memory of what had happened 
 I do n't know what happened to ProtagonistA on the moon , but I 'm just glad ProtagonistA 's back to normal now 
As usual , when ProtagonistA appeared before ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA carried a small silver bird , a beak like a black - crowned gull , and a silver piece of lead 
 ProtagonistA placed the bird and lead on the table and waited 
  ProtagonistA 'm not sure ,  ProtagonistA replied 
  ProtagonistA found the bird and lead on the ground and thought they might be important 
  ProtagonistA may go 
  ProtagonistA picked up the bird and lead and left the courtroom 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what they meant , but ProtagonistA knew they were important 
ProtagonistA had not been awake for more than ten minutes when ProtagonistA was informed that there was ProtagonistB waiting for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to hear this , as ProtagonistA had not been expecting any visitors 
 When ProtagonistA went downstairs , ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB was indeed waiting for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was pleased to have a new maid , and ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for coming 
ProtagonistA lived in a house which ProtagonistA called the Champion House 
 ProtagonistA loved spending time in ProtagonistA's backyard , especially in the summer 
 ProtagonistA would often have picnics with ProtagonistA's friends and family 
 One summer day , ProtagonistA was having a picnic with ProtagonistA's family in the backyard 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's family ended up having a fun time picking up the food off the ground and eating it 
 Even though the Champion House was small , ProtagonistA loved it because it was ProtagonistA's home 
ProtagonistA was a great wizard , and ProtagonistA owned ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were always together , and they were best friends 
ProtagonistA had just finished a long and tiresome day in the harvest of an apple orchard , when ProtagonistB appeared before ProtagonistA alone 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB have something to tell ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said , with a serious look on ProtagonistB's face 
  What is it , ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked , tired and ready for bed 
 ProtagonistA must be careful , ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been planning ProtagonistA's revenge for months 
 ProtagonistA had been a member of the Three - Eyed Dog gang for years , but ProtagonistA had always been on the outskirts , never fully trusted by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had always been loyal , though , and had never given ProtagonistB a reason to doubt ProtagonistA 
 But when ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistB was planning to kill ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to act fast 
 ProtagonistA waited until half an hour before the beginning of the year , when ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would be asleep 
 ProtagonistA snuck into ProtagonistB's room and pulled out ProtagonistA's knife , ready to strike 
 But as ProtagonistA raised it above ProtagonistA's head , ProtagonistA hesitated 
 ProtagonistA could n't do it 
 ProtagonistA could n't kill ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA lowered the knife and crept out of the room , ProtagonistA's heart heavy with sadness and betrayal 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never be able to trust ProtagonistB again , but ProtagonistA also knew ProtagonistA could n't kill ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA would have to find another way to get ProtagonistA's revenge 
ProtagonistA , says that although ProtagonistA was born in the year 1646 , ProtagonistA has never heard of a time when ProtagonistA had not heard of a certain gentleman , who is still living , although not a very long time ago 
 Even though ProtagonistB is getting up there in years , ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistB will always be there for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was overjoyed when ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was confused and scared , until ProtagonistA saw the tiny room ProtagonistA was in 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was in a dream and that the toys were gone because ProtagonistA was now an adult 
 ProtagonistA woke up and was relieved to find that ProtagonistA was still in ProtagonistA's own room 
Good - by , ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA said as ProtagonistA pulled the hood up 
 ProtagonistA had seen enough heroes in ProtagonistA's day , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would only end up like the others 
 ProtagonistA had given up on heroes a long time ago 
 ProtagonistA had stopped believing in them when ProtagonistA was just a little girl 
 ProtagonistA had sworn then that ProtagonistA would never be fooled by a hero again 
 And ProtagonistA had kept that promise , until ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was different from the others , ProtagonistA could tell 
 ProtagonistB was going to make it , ProtagonistA just knew it 
 And so ProtagonistA had helped ProtagonistB , in whatever way ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA had given ProtagonistB shelter , and food , and weapons 
 ProtagonistA had even given ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's heart 
 ProtagonistA could n't protect ProtagonistB forever 
 So ProtagonistA sent ProtagonistB off , with a heavy heart , but a hopeful one as well 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would make it 
 ProtagonistA was a bit of a loner and did n't have many friends 
 One day , ProtagonistA went for a walk in the woods and came across ProtagonistB 
 The door was very small , but ProtagonistA was able to fit through it 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a strange place 
 ProtagonistA had many adventures in this place and ProtagonistA eventually became good friends with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours and was tired , but ProtagonistA was determined to find ProtagonistA's way back home 
 ProtagonistA had been following ProtagonistB and had ended up in this strange place 
 ProtagonistA was just about to give up and sit down when ProtagonistA saw a beautiful butterfly fluttering by 
 ProtagonistA followed it and it led ProtagonistA to a small door 
 ProtagonistA went through the door and found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden 
 ProtagonistA saw the butterfly land on a flower and ProtagonistA followed it 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name 
ProtagonistA was sure that the world was ending 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA's family and friends ProtagonistA's farewells , sure that ProtagonistA would not see them again 
 The night before they set out to find ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA went to bed , sure that ProtagonistA would not wake up again 
 When ProtagonistA did wake up , ProtagonistA was surprised to find that the world had not ended and ProtagonistA was not dead 
 ProtagonistA joins ProtagonistA's family and friends on their journey to find ProtagonistB , hopeful that they will find ProtagonistB and that ProtagonistB will be able to save the world 
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA agreed and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to close ProtagonistA's eyes 
 When ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes , ProtagonistA was in a different part of the forest 
 After a while , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's cat and ProtagonistA was very happy 
 ProtagonistA started to walk back the way ProtagonistA came when ProtagonistA heard someone following ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was running through the forest , trying to find ProtagonistA's way out 
 ProtagonistA was getting tired and ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistB was still following ProtagonistA 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA ran into a tree and ProtagonistA fell to the ground 
 ProtagonistA ran out of the Forest and ProtagonistA was safe 
 ProtagonistA was very thankful that ProtagonistA's cat had saved ProtagonistA 
 This time ProtagonistA had gone too far 
 ProtagonistA had made a complete idiot of ProtagonistA in front of the whole court , and now ProtagonistA was going to pay for it 
At the time ProtagonistA had not even heard of the Winter Sickness , but ProtagonistA knew everything about it 
 ProtagonistA had seen the commercials on TV and read the articles in the paper 
 ProtagonistA knew that it was a serious illness that caused people to get very sick 
 ProtagonistA also knew that it was something that you could get if you were not careful 
 ProtagonistA was very careful 
 ProtagonistA made sure to wash ProtagonistA's hands often and to avoid touching ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA also made sure to stay away from people who were sick 
 ProtagonistA did not want to get the Winter Sickness 
 One day , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB coughing and sneezing 
 ProtagonistA moved away from ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could not help but to think about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA wondered if ProtagonistB had the Winter Sickness 
 Later that day , ProtagonistA started to feel sick 
 ProtagonistA had a headache and felt very tired 
 ProtagonistA also had a sore throat 
 ProtagonistA started to worry that ProtagonistA might have the Winter Sickness 
 ProtagonistA went to the doctor 
 ProtagonistA was just sick with a cold 
 ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had not gotten the Winter Sickness 
 ProtagonistA never knew ProtagonistA's mother , and ProtagonistA's father died when ProtagonistA was only six years old 
 However , ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was a burden to ProtagonistA's aunt and was always looking for a way to leave and make ProtagonistA's own way in the world 
 When ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA finally got ProtagonistA's chance when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB and they moved to America , where ProtagonistA found happiness and a new life 
 ProtagonistA had seen a great white rabbit , and it had led ProtagonistA down a hole into a strange and fantastical world 
 ProtagonistA had met creatures there that ProtagonistA had never seen before , and ProtagonistA had been chased by a fearsome creature called the Jabberwock 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a long , dark hallway 
 ProtagonistA walked towards the door , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could hear voices 
 ProtagonistA could hear someone crying , and someone else trying to comfort them 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that the door was slightly ajar , and ProtagonistA could see two people inside 
 ProtagonistA could n't see ProtagonistC's face , but ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistC was comforting ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to intrude , so ProtagonistA turned to leave , but just as ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB say something that stopped ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's tracks 
  ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was talking about , but ProtagonistA had a feeling ProtagonistA knew 
 ProtagonistA turned back to the door , and pushed it open a little bit more 
 ProtagonistA peered inside , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB and ProtagonistC 
 And ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistC was crying too 
ProtagonistA was a kind man , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB very much 
 ProtagonistA would often take ProtagonistB into the little room in the king 's house within the great garden behind the house , and they would sit and talk together 
ProtagonistA was not planning to marry , not until ProtagonistA had had ProtagonistA's fill of the immaculate manse 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a free spirit , and the thought of being tied down to one place for the rest of ProtagonistA's life was not appealing 
 However , when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's match 
 However , after a few years , ProtagonistA began to feel restless 
 ProtagonistA missed the freedom of ProtagonistA's single life , and ProtagonistA longed for adventure 
 One day , ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and left the manse , leaving ProtagonistB behind 
 ProtagonistA knew it was not fair to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could not help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had to see the world , and ProtagonistA was not going to let anything or anyone stop ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA never thought that ProtagonistA would have to keep such a secret from ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that it was necessary 
 And ProtagonistA could n't let that happen , not when ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB so much 
 So ProtagonistA kept the secret , even though it tore ProtagonistA apart to do so 
 And ProtagonistA would do anything to keep ProtagonistB safe 
ProtagonistA was a cold woman who never showed any emotion 
 ProtagonistA was always distant and seemed to be looking down on everyone 
 Maybe if ProtagonistB had been a better person , ProtagonistA would have loved ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the edge of the water , eating a dinner of snowball peas and tarts , in the backyard of the house ProtagonistA had rented for the summer 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about how much ProtagonistA loved the ocean , and how ProtagonistA was going to miss it when ProtagonistA had to go back to ProtagonistA's job in the city 
 ProtagonistA was also thinking about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know ProtagonistB's name , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to see ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistA was a young woman of 21 , and had just been married off to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have some company , even if it was just the other ladies in the neighborhood coming over for a chat 
 The colonies ?  ProtagonistA said , surprised 
 ProtagonistA , now realized how serious it was 
 It was to be a three - quarter length , in a white dress , with ProtagonistA's hair down , and ProtagonistA was to sit in an arm - chair with ProtagonistA's feet on a stool 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's life , and how ProtagonistA had always wanted to be an artist , and how ProtagonistA had been so disappointed when ProtagonistB had sent ProtagonistA to the Gallery 
  But ProtagonistA do n't see why a lady should live any differently from other people 
 ProtagonistA should like to live in a studio , and have ProtagonistA's meals there , and work all day 
  ProtagonistA am sure ProtagonistA could work just as well there as ProtagonistA can here 
 ProtagonistA was silent for a moment , and then ProtagonistA said :  ProtagonistA do n't see why being proper should make any difference to one 's work 
 ProtagonistA am sure ProtagonistA could be just as good an artist if ProtagonistA lived in a studio as ProtagonistA can here 
ProtagonistA was a widow who loved ProtagonistA's children very much 
 ProtagonistA was always there for them when they needed ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA always tried to make sure they were happy 
 One day , ProtagonistA received a call from ProtagonistA's daughter that ProtagonistB had been in an accident 
 ProtagonistA rushed to the hospital to be by ProtagonistB's side 
ProtagonistA had been drinking with ProtagonistC and ProtagonistB at a little inn in a certain town in the United States at the time when the great tempo of American industry was at an end 
 ProtagonistA ca n't even remember what it was about now , but we were both quite heated 
 ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistC , ProtagonistA really am 
 ProtagonistA did n't mean it , ProtagonistA was just angry 
 ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistA know ProtagonistA were trying to keep it a secret , but ProtagonistB knows 
ProtagonistA was sitting at ProtagonistA's dining - room table in the picture - room , watching with some interest as the door of ProtagonistA's second - class compartment was pushed open 
 But ProtagonistA was also excited to finally be here 
 As the door opened , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing in the doorway 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but stare at ProtagonistB 
 Finally , ProtagonistA spoke up 
 ProtagonistA name is Alice ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA would never forget the day they met 
ProtagonistA was a woman who lived a simple life 
 ProtagonistA had a hundred sheep and three horses 
 Every day , ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistA's sheep out to graze in the meadow and ProtagonistA's horses out to graze in the pasture 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA searched for the horse for days , but ProtagonistA could not find it 
 Again , ProtagonistA searched for the horse , but ProtagonistA could not find it 
 This time , ProtagonistA was able to find ProtagonistA's horse 
 ProtagonistA was furious 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB and told ProtagonistB what had happened 
 ProtagonistA was finally able to find some peace after the ordeal 
 However , ProtagonistA was now extra careful with ProtagonistA's animals and made sure to keep a closer eye on them 
Every Sunday , ProtagonistA , had the usual Sunday breakfast 
 On Father 's Day , ProtagonistA always made a special breakfast for ProtagonistB 
 This year , ProtagonistA wanted to make something extra special , so ProtagonistA decided to make ProtagonistB ProtagonistB's favorite : pancakes 
 ProtagonistA got up early on Father 's Day and started to make the pancakes 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to make them for ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA forgot to put the milk in the batter 
 Even though the pancakes were n't perfect , ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA was able to make ProtagonistB happy on Father 's Day 
ProtagonistA was a beautiful young woman , and the daughter of Alfred the Great 
 ProtagonistA was tall and thin , with graceful features 
 ProtagonistA was very beautiful , with long blonde hair and blue eyes 
 ProtagonistA was also very popular at school , and had many friends 
 However , ProtagonistA was also very shy , and often felt uncomfortable in social situations 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to talk to ProtagonistB about it 
 After that , ProtagonistA started to try to be more confident , and it worked 
 ProtagonistA became more popular than ever , and was even elected to be the president of ProtagonistA's class 
ProtagonistA went to bed in the morning , early , thinking of the presents ProtagonistA would be leaving ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had wrapped them all up and placed them under the tree , and ProtagonistA could n't wait to see the look on ProtagonistB's face when ProtagonistB opened them 
 ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistB would be surprised and delighted 
 ProtagonistA drifted off to sleep dreaming of ProtagonistB's reaction 
ProtagonistA was lying on the floor on ProtagonistA's back , rocking back and forth , stretching out ProtagonistA's heels in the air 
 ProtagonistA felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA lower back and knew ProtagonistA needed to see a doctor 
 ProtagonistA had been putting it off for weeks , but now ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't wait any longer 
 ProtagonistA got up slowly , wincing in pain , and made ProtagonistA's way to the phone 
 ProtagonistA called ProtagonistA's doctor and made an appointment for the following day 
 ProtagonistA then called ProtagonistB to tell ProtagonistB what was going on and to ask ProtagonistB to come home from work early to help ProtagonistA with the kids 
 ProtagonistA was in a lot of pain and knew ProtagonistA would n't be able to take care of them the way ProtagonistA needed to 
 ProtagonistA lay back down on the floor and tried to relax , but the pain was too intense 
 ProtagonistA ended up taking a painkiller and falling asleep 
 ProtagonistA had never been so happy , and ProtagonistA felt that ProtagonistA owed it all to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB with all of ProtagonistA's heart , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA just as much 
 ProtagonistA was a stay - at - home mom and ProtagonistA's husband was a successful businessman 
 However , ProtagonistA was starting to feel restless 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to take a walk in the park 
 As ProtagonistA was walking , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA walked home quickly and went to ProtagonistA's bedroom 
 ProtagonistA locked the door and started to undress 
 ProtagonistA touched ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA getting wetter and wetter 
 After ProtagonistA calmed down , ProtagonistA felt guilty 
 ProtagonistA was married and ProtagonistA had never cheated on ProtagonistA's husband before 
 But ProtagonistA could n't help but feel excited about the possibility of having an affair 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would have to be careful but ProtagonistA was ready to take the risk 
ProtagonistA was nine years old when ProtagonistA first heard of the death of ProtagonistA's father 
 ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's bedroom , playing with ProtagonistA's dolls , when ProtagonistB came in and sat down on the bed 
 ProtagonistA was sad , but ProtagonistA did n't cry 
 ProtagonistA just sat there , holding ProtagonistA's dolls close 
ProtagonistA was a fine , cheerful , cheerful girl of fifteen years of age , who had a cheerful manner , and good sense , but no very good sense ; and though ProtagonistA was wo nt to be a good - humoured and a happy - go - lucky girl , ProtagonistA was not without a certain air of melancholy 
 ProtagonistB was a widower , and ProtagonistA was the daughter of ProtagonistB's late wife 's sister 
 ProtagonistA was very happy in ProtagonistA's new home , and made the best of everything 
 ProtagonistA was a good wife to ProtagonistB , and a loving mother to ProtagonistA's children 
 However , ProtagonistA never complained , but went on cheerfully doing ProtagonistA's duty , until the end came 
ProtagonistA was three years old when ProtagonistA was brought to bay in the arms of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what was happening 
 ProtagonistA never forgot the kindness of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was only 18 at the time , and ProtagonistB's death left ProtagonistA with a small fortune of a few thousand pounds 
 ProtagonistA was not sure what to do with the money , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would have to make some decisions soon 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had been best friends since they were in diapers 
 So when ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was sick , ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to offer ProtagonistB anything ProtagonistB needed 
 ProtagonistA was by ProtagonistB's side every step of the way , cheering ProtagonistB on and helping ProtagonistB through the tough times 
ProtagonistA had been on the ocean liner for days , and ProtagonistA was starting to get restless 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like the vast expanse of the ocean before , and it was both beautiful and terrifying 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but wonder what was down there , in the depths of the ocean 
 Was there another world , another life ? ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear ProtagonistB's voice until ProtagonistB was right behind ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA was startled out of ProtagonistA's reverie and followed ProtagonistB inside 
 ProtagonistA would never forget the sun rising red over the ocean , and the sense of wonder it had inspired in ProtagonistA 
One day , when ProtagonistA was about twelve years old , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were riding in the back of a coach through the suburbs of New York 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB could please stop so ProtagonistA could play with them 
 ProtagonistA got out and ran over to the children 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to be playing with them 
 ProtagonistA had so much fun , ProtagonistA forgot to come back to the coach 
 ProtagonistA apologized and promised to never do it again 
 ProtagonistA learned ProtagonistA's lesson and was more careful after that 
ProtagonistA was very passionate about ProtagonistA's interests , and ProtagonistA was very little 
 ProtagonistA was always exploring and trying new things 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a book about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistA's parents if ProtagonistA could go , but they said no 
 ProtagonistA was disappointed , but ProtagonistA did n't give up 
 ProtagonistA kept asking and asking , and eventually they let ProtagonistA go 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to finally be going to ProtagonistB 
The last time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a man 
 ProtagonistA was shocked and confused , but did n't say anything 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to process what ProtagonistA was seeing 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to make of it 
 ProtagonistA did n't understand what had just happened 
 ProtagonistA never saw ProtagonistB again after that day 
 ProtagonistA always wondered what had happened to ProtagonistB , and if ProtagonistB was okay 
ProtagonistA was walking home from getting groceries when ProtagonistA was suddenly grabbed from behind 
 ProtagonistA tried to wiggle free , but it was no use 
 ProtagonistA begged for ProtagonistA's life , but ProtagonistB did n't care 
 ProtagonistA had watched ProtagonistB's decline day by day , until one day ProtagonistB was gone 
 The first time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB dead , ProtagonistA felt the dread of death wash over ProtagonistA 
 It was a feeling ProtagonistA would never forget 
 ProtagonistA could hear the cold wind howling and ProtagonistA's hair stirred , and ProtagonistA's face grew red and pouted 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise behind ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA spun around 
 ProtagonistA started to walk faster , but the noise came again , closer this time 
 ProtagonistA began to run , but ProtagonistA was not fast enough 
 ProtagonistA felt something grab ProtagonistA from behind and ProtagonistA screamed 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA being lifted off the ground and then everything went black 
ProtagonistA was walking home from the grocery store when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking hand in hand with a dead man 
 ProtagonistA felt a strong urge to help , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if it was any of ProtagonistA's business 
 ProtagonistA could have easily gone either way , but ProtagonistA decided to help 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and asked if ProtagonistB needed help 
 ProtagonistA was only six years old , and ProtagonistA's brother was just a baby 
 The parsonage was a small , cramped house , and ProtagonistA was terrified of the dark 
 ProtagonistA huddled in a corner , trying to make ProtagonistA as small as possible , and prayed for morning to come 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise outside 
 ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistB was a thief 
 ProtagonistA was about to scream for help when ProtagonistA heard someone else climbing the tower 
 ProtagonistA realised that these men were not thieves 
 ProtagonistA watched as the men reached the top of the tower and started to rappel down the other side 
 ProtagonistA was no longer afraid 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget this night 
ProtagonistA's friends called ProtagonistA's squire , but ProtagonistA would not cast a glance aside , for ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistB was the kindest , most gentle man ProtagonistA had ever met , and ProtagonistA cherished ProtagonistB above all else 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was the luckiest woman alive 
 ProtagonistA could see the worry in ProtagonistB's eyes , but ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to reassure ProtagonistB 
 They would get through this , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA got a job as a waitress to help make ends meet , and ProtagonistB started doing odd jobs around the neighborhood 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to make it through this 
 But ProtagonistA had to be strong 
 ProtagonistA had to be there for ProtagonistB 
 And ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA nursed ProtagonistB through ProtagonistB's final days , never leaving ProtagonistB's side 
 ProtagonistA was with ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB passed away , holding ProtagonistB's hand and telling ProtagonistB how much ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had to honor ProtagonistB's memory by living ProtagonistA's life to the fullest 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would want that for ProtagonistA 
 And so , ProtagonistA did 
One day in August , a winter in the West , ProtagonistA came to a village to pick up ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistC's head and down at ProtagonistA's feet and said ,  ProtagonistB , go on 
  ProtagonistC had always been a bit of a mystery to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA had always been content to follow ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being led around blindly and wanted to know what was going on 
  Go on ,  ProtagonistA said again 
  ProtagonistA 'll be right behind ProtagonistB 
  And with that , ProtagonistA set off after ProtagonistC , determined to find out what ProtagonistC was up to 
 That 's how ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA the night ProtagonistA rose from ProtagonistA's deepest sleep 
 ProtagonistA was floating above them , ProtagonistA's eyes closed and a serene smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 Then ProtagonistA slowly floated away , disappearing into the night 
ProtagonistA had always loved the stars 
 ProtagonistA loved the way they twinkled and shone , and ProtagonistA loved the way they made ProtagonistA feel small 
 ProtagonistA loved the way they made ProtagonistA feel like anything was possible 
 But lately , ProtagonistA had been feeling different 
 ProtagonistA felt like the stars were too bright , and they made ProtagonistA feel dizzy 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to fall 
 One night , ProtagonistA went out to the beach to look at the stars 
 The sky was blue and black and vast with the stars , but ProtagonistA was pale and yellow and ProtagonistA's light was dim , casting a yellowish tinge over the sea of stars which stands above the earth 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to faint 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to fall into the sky 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to die 
 ProtagonistA felt a hand on ProtagonistA's shoulder , and ProtagonistA felt someone else 's light shining next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt safe 
 ProtagonistA turned to see who it was , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt better then 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could stand up and face the stars again 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could face anything 
ProtagonistA had been on the ship for weeks , and ProtagonistA was getting tired of being cooped up 
 ProtagonistA longed to be on land , to feel the sun on ProtagonistA's face and the grass beneath ProtagonistA's feet 
 When the ship stopped at the bridge , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's chance 
 ProtagonistA begged ProtagonistB to take ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB agreed 
 ProtagonistA was overjoyed to be on land again 
 ProtagonistA felt alive and free 
 But within days , ProtagonistA started to feel ill 
 ProtagonistA had no money and no way to get help 
 ProtagonistA tried to make it to the ship , but ProtagonistA was too weak 
 ProtagonistA died of cholera a few miles from the bridge 
 ProtagonistA knocked at the door , and when ProtagonistB opened it , ProtagonistA asked for ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA then asked if ProtagonistB could come in and wait for ProtagonistC 
 After a while , ProtagonistA began to feel sleepy , and ProtagonistA dozed off in ProtagonistA's chair 
ProtagonistA had been drinking with ProtagonistB all evening , and ProtagonistA had been told to go to bed early , for ProtagonistA was going to spend all night with ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistB went to bed , ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB and snuggled up close to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt a bit lonely , but ProtagonistA was glad to be spending the night with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA 's coming 
 ProtagonistA 's ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA was coming to visit ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA arrived in town and made ProtagonistA's way to ProtagonistB's house 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB all about ProtagonistA's life since they had last seen each other 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA had to leave 
 ProtagonistA promised to come back soon 
 As ProtagonistB raised the blade , ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes , resigned to ProtagonistA's fate 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being told what to do , so ProtagonistA decided to go into the forest anyway 
 Deep in the forest , ProtagonistA came across a strange creature 
 ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA did n't want to show it 
 ProtagonistA stood up to the creature and said ,  ProtagonistA will not let you hurt ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had stood up to the creature and it had left ProtagonistA alone 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA did n't need ProtagonistB to tell ProtagonistA what to do all the time 
 ProtagonistA could stand up for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was a great speaker 
 ProtagonistA always captivated ProtagonistA's audience with ProtagonistA's stories 
 Today , ProtagonistA was telling a story about ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was fifteen when ProtagonistA walked into the shopper 's window of the stockade at Nightingale 's Gate , and into the room that was always there , and out of the dark , dusty floors 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , ever since ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's home in the forest 
 ProtagonistA was tired and hungry , and ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was going 
 But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving 
 But as ProtagonistA reached for the handle , ProtagonistA heard a voice behind ProtagonistA 
 I'm Alice ,  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's voice shaking 
  ProtagonistA 'm just looking for a way out 
  ProtagonistA ca n't just walk in here and take what ProtagonistA want 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA was scared and ProtagonistA did n't want to get in trouble 
 But ProtagonistA also did n't want to spend the rest of ProtagonistA's life in this tiny room 
 Please ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA wo n't take anything 
 ProtagonistA nodded , and then ProtagonistA was out the door and on ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving 
ProtagonistA was walking through the great halls of the castle when ProtagonistA came face to face with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with a kindly expression and said ,  ProtagonistA , what are ProtagonistA doing here all alone?Alice told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's story ; how ProtagonistA had been walking in the forest when ProtagonistA got lost and could n't find ProtagonistA's way home 
 ProtagonistA agreed and the two of them spent the day talking and getting to know each other 
 By the end of the day , ProtagonistA was feeling much better and ProtagonistB was happy to have had some company 
 ProtagonistA was very grateful and promised to come back and visit ProtagonistB again soon 
ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's pregnant state , was feeling the weight of the world on ProtagonistA's shoulders 
 ProtagonistA prayed to ProtagonistB , for guidance and wisdom in choosing the right path for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's son 
 ProtagonistA asked that ProtagonistB be given the strength to establish ProtagonistB's religion and to gather ProtagonistB's followers in this city 
ProtagonistA is sitting alone in a hospital bed , across the way from ProtagonistA's home 
 ProtagonistA is waiting for the doctors to come and tell ProtagonistA what is wrong with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA is worried that ProtagonistA might have cancer 
 ProtagonistA has been feeling tired and weak for the past few months 
 ProtagonistA has lost a lot of weight , and ProtagonistA has no appetite 
 ProtagonistA knows that this is not going to be good news 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm sorry to have to tell ProtagonistA this , but ProtagonistA have cancer 
 ProtagonistA breaks down into tears 
 ProtagonistA ca n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA is only thirty years old 
 ProtagonistA has a young daughter at home 
 ProtagonistA does n't want to leave ProtagonistA's daughter alone in this world 
 ProtagonistA is scared , but ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA has to fight 
 ProtagonistA has to fight for ProtagonistA's daughter , for ProtagonistA's family , and for ProtagonistA's own life 
ProtagonistA was a well - built , long - legged , very pretty , pretty girl with a certain childlike air of innocence about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had blue eyes and blond hair which ProtagonistA wore in a long braid down ProtagonistA's back 
 ProtagonistA was always cheerful and happy , even when bad things happened , like when ProtagonistA's parents died in a car accident when ProtagonistA was only eight 
 Even then , ProtagonistA bounced back quickly , living with ProtagonistA's Aunt Tillie and going to school like nothing had happened 
 Now , at eighteen , ProtagonistA was finishing up high school and looking forward to the future 
 ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was pretty sure ProtagonistB was going to ask ProtagonistA to marry ProtagonistB soon 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do without ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA was a strong girl 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would get through this , even if it took some time 
 And eventually , ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA met someone new , a guy named Bob , and they got married 
 And ProtagonistA lived happily ever after 
 I've never read it ,  ProtagonistA admitted 
 Finally , ProtagonistA stood up 
 ProtagonistA walked back into the house , feeling refreshed 
 ProtagonistA should do it more often 
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA saw a strange light in the distance 
 ProtagonistA walked towards it and saw that it was coming from a lamp on a small platform in the center of the light 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA saw that there was a person sitting on the platform , and they were looking at ProtagonistA with a strange expression 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had seen this person before , but ProtagonistA could n't remember where 
 ProtagonistA walked closer to the platform and sat down 
 ProtagonistA thanked the person and began to look for the door 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where it was , but ProtagonistA was determined to find it 
 ProtagonistA searched for hours , but ProtagonistA could n't find it 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw a door in the distance 
ProtagonistA sits cross - legged on the floor of the dark alcove , ProtagonistA's fingers tracing the lines of a small painting 
 ProtagonistA feels a sense of peace emanating from the painting , and ProtagonistA ca n't help but feel drawn to it 
 ProtagonistA sits there for a long time , just staring at the painting and letting ProtagonistA's mind wander 
 ProtagonistB was a successful businessman , and ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's only child 
 ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA could ever want , but ProtagonistA was still unhappy 
 ProtagonistA was always getting into trouble at school , and ProtagonistB had to bail ProtagonistA out 
 ProtagonistA was constantly partying and drinking , and ProtagonistB was worried about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't listen 
 ProtagonistA partyied even more and ProtagonistA's grades suffered 
 ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA had made a mistake 
 ProtagonistA tried to get ProtagonistB to take ProtagonistA back , but ProtagonistB refused 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA did n't need ProtagonistB's money to be happy 
 ProtagonistA was always doing things differently 
 ProtagonistA would walk to school a different way every day , and ProtagonistA would always find new and interesting things to do 
ProtagonistA had been fighting for ProtagonistA's life for what felt like hours 
 ProtagonistB was a skilled swordsman , and ProtagonistA was quickly tiring 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't keep this up much longer 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's opportunity 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's chance and lunged forward , disarming ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA went to move forward and finish ProtagonistB off , but ProtagonistA's foot caught on something and ProtagonistA stumbled 
 ProtagonistA quickly regained ProtagonistA's footing and ran to ProtagonistB , pulling ProtagonistB back from the edge 
 ProtagonistA helped ProtagonistB to ProtagonistB's feet and handed ProtagonistB ProtagonistB's sword 
  But ProtagonistA 're not the only one with tricks up their sleeve 
ProtagonistA had been thinking all night and ProtagonistA 'd been stumped ever since 
 ProtagonistA had been trying to think of a way to tell ProtagonistB , that ProtagonistA liked ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB liked ProtagonistA too , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistB liked ProtagonistA in the same way 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to ruin their friendship if ProtagonistB did n't feel the same way 
 ProtagonistA finally decided that ProtagonistA would just have to tell ProtagonistB and see what happened 
 ProtagonistA gathered ProtagonistA's courage and approached ProtagonistB the next day 
ProtagonistA had driven for an entire day , and a whole day 's sleep , and had done nothing of note save to be driven to the place ProtagonistA was going to be raped 
 ProtagonistA had been planning to stop at a motel for the night , but ProtagonistB had told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA would not be needing a room 
 ProtagonistA had no idea what was going to happen to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA knew it could n't be good 
 ProtagonistA had been planning to fight back , but ProtagonistA was so tired from the drive that ProtagonistA could n't muster the energy 
 ProtagonistA could hear someone else in the room , but ProtagonistA could n't see them 
 Then , ProtagonistA felt a cold , hard object press against ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA knew what was coming next , and ProtagonistA resigned ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's fate 
ProtagonistA had been very wrong in ProtagonistA's belief that I would ever be with anyone , or marry anyone 
 ProtagonistA had seen me with many women over the years , but ProtagonistA always assumed that I was just playing the field and that I would eventually settle down with one woman 
 ProtagonistA was wrong 
 ProtagonistA was happy for me , but ProtagonistA also could n't help but feel a little bit jealous 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to be with me , but ProtagonistA knew that it was never meant to be 
ProtagonistA was sitting at ProtagonistA's typewriter , studying the words typed on the screen 
 ProtagonistA was trying to decide if ProtagonistA should change them or not 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about how ProtagonistA's story was going to end 
 ProtagonistA had a few ideas , but ProtagonistA was n't sure which one to choose 
 ProtagonistA was also thinking about the other stories ProtagonistA had written 
 ProtagonistA was wondering if ProtagonistA should change them too 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about all of this when ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA got up from ProtagonistA's chair and went to the door 
 ProtagonistA looked through the peephole and saw ProtagonistB walking up the stairs 
 ProtagonistA quickly went back to ProtagonistA's typewriter and sat down 
 ProtagonistA was trying to think of a way to get out of the situation 
 ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB coming closer to ProtagonistA's door 
 ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB stop at ProtagonistA's door 
 ProtagonistA held ProtagonistA's breath 
 ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB put the bag down 
 ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB fumbling with something 
 ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB curse 
 ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB walk away 
 ProtagonistA waited a few minutes before ProtagonistA got up 
 ProtagonistA looked out the peephole again 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and looked around 
 ProtagonistA did n't see ProtagonistB or the bag 
 ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistA's typewriter and sat down 
 ProtagonistA was also curious about what was in the bag 
 ProtagonistA decided to go and find out 
ProtagonistA was out for a walk in the park when ProtagonistA came across a bush 
 ProtagonistA had never seen ProtagonistB before , but ProtagonistA was n't sure 
 What 's ProtagonistA's name ?  ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's name , and the two of them talked for a while 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA had to go , but ProtagonistA promised to come back and visit ProtagonistB again 
ProtagonistA has always considered ProtagonistA a strong and independent woman 
 Yes , ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB deeply and they had a great relationship , but ProtagonistA also felt like ProtagonistA now had a responsibility to ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA did n't have before 
 ProtagonistA became more aware of ProtagonistA's need to take care of ProtagonistB and make sure that ProtagonistB was happy and healthy 
 In some ways , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was losing ProtagonistA's independence by being married 
 But , at the same time , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was gaining something much more valuable : a true partner in life who loved and supported ProtagonistA unconditionally 
ProtagonistA ran with alacrity through several miles of fields , forests , and meadows , bearing with ProtagonistA the great stuff of life : the apple , the bramble , the cherry - tree , the thorn - trees , and so many trees , some two hundred yards in circumference 
 ProtagonistA had been running for hours , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and ProtagonistA's breath was coming in ragged gasps 
 But ProtagonistA did n't stop , ProtagonistA could n't stop 
 ProtagonistA had to keep going , ProtagonistA had to find the others 
 ProtagonistA had been running for days 
 ProtagonistA had no food , no water , and no idea where ProtagonistA was going 
 But ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 ProtagonistA had to find the others 
 ProtagonistA finally came to a clearing in the forest and saw a small cabin in the distance 
 ProtagonistA pounded on the door of the cabin , but there was no answer 
 ProtagonistA tried the handle , but it was locked 
 ProtagonistA collapsed to the ground , defeated 
 ProtagonistA was so tired , so thirsty , and so hungry 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how much longer ProtagonistA could go on 
 ProtagonistA 're safe now 
 ProtagonistA was too weak to resist 
 ProtagonistA allowed ProtagonistB to help ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's feet and lead ProtagonistA into the cabin 
 Inside , ProtagonistA found the others 
 ProtagonistA collapsed into the arms of ProtagonistA's friends , relief washing over ProtagonistA 
Once upon a time , in a deep , dark corner of the universe , there was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was a very old , very fat king 
 ProtagonistA ruled over ProtagonistA's kingdom with an iron fist , and anyone who dared cross ProtagonistA was swiftly dealt with 
ProtagonistA was well past the age of twenty when ProtagonistA found the way to hell 
 ProtagonistA had always been a curious girl , and ProtagonistA was always looking for new adventures 
 ProtagonistA had to see it for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA found the way to hell easily enough 
 But ProtagonistA was also curious , and ProtagonistA wanted to see what this place was all about 
 ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA in the presence of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was a fearsome creature , and ProtagonistA was terrified of ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA was also curious , and ProtagonistA wanted to know more about ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA was also curious , and ProtagonistA wanted to know more 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA became tired of ProtagonistB's world , and ProtagonistA wanted to leave 
 ProtagonistA was horrified , and ProtagonistA regretted ever coming to this place 
ProtagonistA was always a tall girl , even when ProtagonistA was just six years old 
 ProtagonistA towers over ProtagonistA's classmates and everyone always comments on how pretty ProtagonistA is 
 But ProtagonistA never really felt like ProtagonistA fit in 
 ProtagonistA was always the tallest , the prettiest , and the smartest girl in ProtagonistA's class , but ProtagonistA never felt like ProtagonistA belonged 
 One day , ProtagonistA ran into ProtagonistB 
 Now , whenever ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA does n't belong , ProtagonistA thinks of ProtagonistB and knows that ProtagonistA 's not alone 
ProtagonistA was walking through town on the left hand side of the road when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB's story was 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB was beautiful and that ProtagonistB deserved to be loved 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to go on without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so lost and confused 
 One day , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's grave and ProtagonistA just sat there and cried 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had no one to turn to 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt a hand on ProtagonistA's shoulder and ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistB standing there 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe that ProtagonistA had just seen ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistB had given ProtagonistA the strength to go on 
 Even though ProtagonistB was gone , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would always be with ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was sitting at the table with ProtagonistA's family on the first day of the summer solstice 
ProtagonistA had been walking ProtagonistB , every day for years 
 Even in ProtagonistA's seventies , ProtagonistA was still able to take ProtagonistB for a walk around the block 
 One day , as they were walking , ProtagonistA saw a cat in a tree 
 ProtagonistA had never seen that cat before 
 ProtagonistA stopped to look at it 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to leave the cat there , but ProtagonistA did n't want to leave ProtagonistB alone either 
 Finally , ProtagonistA made a decision 
 ProtagonistA would go get help 
 ProtagonistA would find someone to help ProtagonistA get the cat down from the tree 
 ProtagonistA walked home , ProtagonistB by ProtagonistA's side 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had made the right decision 
ProtagonistA descended the aisle of the château of the Riveuilles ; an imposing house of splendour and distinction , from which ProtagonistA received the name of Richelieu , or Richelodio , or , perhaps , of Lord Bertram 
 As ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way down the aisle , ProtagonistA could feel the weight of the name bearing down on ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA held ProtagonistA's head high and continued on 
 ProtagonistA had always been a headstrong girl 
 ProtagonistA was never one to follow the rules or do what was expected of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA much preferred to forge ProtagonistA's own path 
 ProtagonistA had heard rumours of the wild parties that took place there and ProtagonistA was determined to see for ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA descended the aisle , ProtagonistA could feel the eyes of the guests on ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA was there to have fun and that was all that mattered 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA belonged there 
 As the night went on , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA drawn to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't want the night to end 
 ProtagonistA did n't know ProtagonistB's name , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB 
 As ProtagonistA walked back up the aisle , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was floating on air 
 ProtagonistA had found what ProtagonistA was looking for at the château of the Riveuilles 
 ProtagonistA had found a place where ProtagonistA could be ProtagonistA and have fun 
 And ProtagonistA would never forget the night ProtagonistA spent there 
ProtagonistA woke early , and ProtagonistA woke often , as if ProtagonistA had been awake forever , until it was too late 
 ProtagonistA had wanted to get an early start on the day , but now it was already half over 
  ProtagonistA should have been up hours ago 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was right , but ProtagonistA did n't want to admit it 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'll do better tomorrow 
 ProtagonistA went outside , but ProtagonistA did n't feel like playing 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had wasted the day , and ProtagonistA was angry at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA sat down on the porch and watched the birds in the trees , but ProtagonistA did n't feel any better 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA went back inside and up to ProtagonistA's room 
 ProtagonistA lay down on ProtagonistA's bed and stared at the ceiling , wondering what ProtagonistA was going to do with the rest of ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA had chosen the kingdom of ProtagonistB out of all creation ; and the power of ProtagonistC had shone forth in every way , to please ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had walked with the angels , and they had showed ProtagonistA the wonders of ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA's purpose was , ProtagonistA simply replied that ProtagonistA was there to protect the city 
 ProtagonistA said that a great danger was coming and that ProtagonistA would do everything in ProtagonistA's power to stop it 
ProtagonistA was walking after dark when ProtagonistA saw a light in the distance 
 ProtagonistA walked towards it and never stopped 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA saw that the light was coming from a lamp on a porch 
 ProtagonistA walked up to the porch and saw ProtagonistB sitting in a rocking chair 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was n't lost , ProtagonistA was just walking 
 ProtagonistA sat in the rocking chair and they talked 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a dreamer 
 ProtagonistA loved to imagine what it would be like to have the life ProtagonistA always wanted 
 ProtagonistA would often daydream about what it would be like to be rich and famous , or to travel the world 
 And then ProtagonistA drank to the full 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's dreams , ProtagonistA's hopes , and ProtagonistA's fears 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the great dream , the thing ProtagonistA should never have taken the risk of doing 
 With ProtagonistB's help , ProtagonistA was able to make ProtagonistA's dream a reality 
 ProtagonistA was finally able to live the life ProtagonistA had always wanted 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who lived in a small town 
 ProtagonistA was always curious about the world and loved to explore 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole that led ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had many adventures in ProtagonistB and made many new friends 
 ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was a man who had lived a full and interesting life , and ProtagonistA was eager to learn from ProtagonistB 
 For the next few months , ProtagonistA spent every day with ProtagonistB , learning everything ProtagonistB could teach ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA quickly became a skilled writer ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA even began to help ProtagonistB with ProtagonistB's work 
ProtagonistA had been online shopping for a new television for the past hour and a half 
 ProtagonistA had finally found the perfect one on Wal - Mart 's website 
 ProtagonistA decided to chat with ProtagonistB to see if ProtagonistB could do anything about the shipping 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and asked ProtagonistB one more time if there was anything ProtagonistB could do about the shipping 
 ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA almost forgot to thank ProtagonistA's grandmother for the advice 
ProtagonistA was the god of the seas , and ProtagonistB had a hard time determining ProtagonistB's true identity 
 ProtagonistA was the only thing that was real to ProtagonistB anymore 
 ProtagonistA was the only thing that mattered 
ProtagonistA was walking home from ProtagonistA's job at the grocery store when ProtagonistA was accosted by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA did n't have the money 
 ProtagonistA reluctantly agreed to pay ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was given a week to come up with the money 
 ProtagonistA was frantic 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to come up with that kind of money 
 ProtagonistA thought about borrowing it from ProtagonistA's friends or family , but ProtagonistA did n't want to ask them for money 
 ProtagonistA was ashamed and embarrassed 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do 
 Finally , ProtagonistA came up with a plan 
 ProtagonistA would work extra shifts at ProtagonistA's job and save up the money 
 ProtagonistA would not give in to the demands of ProtagonistB 
One morning , after the close of our first term , when the pain on my hand was beginning to subside , ProtagonistA issued a paper which ProtagonistA supposed to be a communication from his Majesty , for it bore the stamp of his Majesty 's office , and was filled with the seal of the State 
ProtagonistA was waiting for ProtagonistB , just as ProtagonistA usually was 
 ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistA's watch and sighed 
 ProtagonistA was just about to leave when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB running towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had only been living in the small town for a few months , but ProtagonistA quickly learned that people here liked to gossip 
 ProtagonistA tried to ignore it , but it was hard when everyone seemed to be talking about ProtagonistA behind ProtagonistA back 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to confront ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB why ProtagonistB was always talking about ProtagonistA 
 From then on , ProtagonistA started to feel more comfortable in ProtagonistA's new town and realized that the gossip was n't so bad after all 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA knew the way to heaven but in fact ProtagonistA knew nothing at all 
 ProtagonistA had always been a good person , never doing anything wrong and always helping others 
 But when ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a dark place with no idea how to get out 
 ProtagonistA called out for help but no one came 
 ProtagonistA wandered around for what felt like hours , until ProtagonistA finally came to a door 
 ProtagonistA opened it and found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB in the distance and started to walk towards ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA kept walking and walking but ProtagonistA never got any closer 
 Eventually ProtagonistA gave up and sat down , exhausted 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's study in the Court of the Tuileries , looking at an old and heavy book which was lying upon a table 
 ProtagonistA had been reading it for hours , and was so absorbed in it that ProtagonistA did not hear the door open 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing beside ProtagonistA , and knew that ProtagonistA's time had come 
 ProtagonistA was not afraid , but merely curious 
 What is it like , Death ?  ProtagonistA asked 
One day , soon after ProtagonistA had become a full - grown man , Mr
 ProtagonistA was very impressed by all that ProtagonistA heard and asked Mr
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was very glad that ProtagonistA had met ProtagonistB 
There was once a boy who was known to everyone but ProtagonistA by ProtagonistA's given name – a boy called Noah , who was supposed to have been born in the year 1224 , on the very day that ProtagonistA was , according to some versions , murdered by a demon ProtagonistB was a strange boy , and people said that ProtagonistB had the eyes of a demon 
One day , ProtagonistA came up to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB why ProtagonistB was always alone 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA's parents what ProtagonistB had said to ProtagonistA , and they were very worried 
 ProtagonistA was a young woman who had been shipwrecked on a small island 
 ProtagonistA was the only survivor 
 ProtagonistA was terrified of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA begged for ProtagonistA's life , but ProtagonistB was determined 
 As ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA cursed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA swore that ProtagonistB would never find peace 
 ProtagonistA believed ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA was special , that ProtagonistA was destined for greatness 
 And so ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to leave ProtagonistA's home and go on a quest to find the fabled City of Gold 
 For years , ProtagonistA searched the world for this city , never giving up hope that ProtagonistA would find it 
 And then , one day , ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA took over as its ruler , and ProtagonistA made it a place where everyone could be happy and live in peace 
 ProtagonistA ruled for many years , and the people loved ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't let that happen 
 ProtagonistA had to find a way to stop ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA could n't just kill ProtagonistB , because that would make ProtagonistA no better than ProtagonistB was 
 So ProtagonistA did the only thing ProtagonistA could think of 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB by the hand and led ProtagonistB away from the City of Gold , back into the wilderness , where ProtagonistB would never be able to hurt anyone ever again 
ProtagonistA was dead , and ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB 
 With ProtagonistB dead , ProtagonistA was finally at peace 
ProtagonistA was a man , or at least ProtagonistA looked like one , of unquestionable fortune 
 ProtagonistA was the kind of woman who knew ProtagonistA's own power and reveled in it 
 ProtagonistA always got what ProtagonistA wanted , whether it was the latest designer handbag or the best table at the most exclusive restaurant 
 Oh , ProtagonistA had had ProtagonistA's fair share of suitors over the years 
 ProtagonistA had always been the one in control , the one who was never quite able to let go and simply be in the moment 
 And so , ProtagonistA had always been alone 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC 
 For the first time in ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could be ProtagonistA 
 And ProtagonistA loved it 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA let down ProtagonistA's guard and allowed ProtagonistA to be loved 
ProtagonistA was in a dream in which ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's family , ProtagonistA's friends , and ProtagonistA's dreams 
 ProtagonistA felt very happy and content , as if ProtagonistA had just met a dear friend 
ProtagonistA had been on ProtagonistA's usual wife - beating sprawl for hours , after how deeply ProtagonistA had been in debt and wasted luxury 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping to find some relief in the bottom of a bottle , but it seemed that even that was not enough to take away the pain 
 ProtagonistA had just about given up hope when ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door 
 When ProtagonistA answered it , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA face to face with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had been wrong and that ProtagonistA needed to make things right 
 ProtagonistA was ready to face the consequences of ProtagonistA's actions and to start fresh 
In the year 1882 , ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB -- at Ull - west in the province of Wales 
 ProtagonistA was the only daughter of a wealthy family and ProtagonistA's parents died when ProtagonistA was very young 
 ProtagonistA had a little money , but ProtagonistA did not want to live on it 
 ProtagonistA wanted to work for ProtagonistA's living 
 ProtagonistA went to Dublin and got a situation as a governess in a large house 
 ProtagonistA was very happy in ProtagonistA's work and ProtagonistA loved the children ProtagonistA taught 
 The years passed and ProtagonistA grew to be a woman 
 ProtagonistA was still working in the same house , but ProtagonistA was no longer a governess 
 ProtagonistA was a companion to the lady of the house 
 ProtagonistA was still happy in ProtagonistA's work , but ProtagonistA had a great sorrow in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was very fond of ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's death was a great blow to ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA bore it bravely and went on with ProtagonistA's work 
 ProtagonistA was still living in the same house , but ProtagonistA was no longer a companion 
 ProtagonistA was a nurse 
 ProtagonistA was still kind and good to the children , but they were all grown up now and ProtagonistA was very lonely 
 ProtagonistA was very happy in ProtagonistA's visits 
 The years passed and ProtagonistA grew very old 
 ProtagonistA was still living in the same house , but ProtagonistA was very feeble now 
 ProtagonistA died a few days afterwards 
ProtagonistA was a young girl who loved to explore 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a rabbit hole and decided to follow it 
 ProtagonistA ended up in ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was excited to explore ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA soon realized that ProtagonistA was lost 
 ProtagonistA tried to find ProtagonistA's way back , but ProtagonistA could n't 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was stuck in ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA would never be able to go home 
 ProtagonistA would often go on walks in the woods near ProtagonistA's house , looking for new places to explore 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a small door in a tree 
 ProtagonistA had never seen it before , and ProtagonistA was curious to see what was inside 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and found a staircase leading down into the ground 
 ProtagonistA carefully stepped inside and began to descend 
 Finally , ProtagonistA reached the bottom and found ProtagonistA in a strange , dark place 
 ProtagonistA could see a light in the distance , and ProtagonistA began to walk towards it 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that the light was coming from a lamp on a table 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to have found this place and to have made a new friend 
 Despite this , ProtagonistA tried to live ProtagonistA's life to the best of ProtagonistA's abilities 
 ProtagonistA was always polite to those around ProtagonistA , no matter how they treated ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA always tried to help others , even if it meant ProtagonistA would be putting ProtagonistA in danger 
 And ProtagonistA always tried to stay positive , even when the world seemed like it was against ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA came across a group of men who were laughing and jeering at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA managed to get ProtagonistB to safety and tended to ProtagonistB's wounds 
 Even though the world was often cruel to ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA continued to try and make it a better place 
 ProtagonistA knew that it was worth it , even if the world did n't always show ProtagonistA that 
ProtagonistA was a young missionary who had been taught to share the gospel with those who were lost 
 ProtagonistA was very good at ProtagonistA's job and was always finding new ways to reach people 
 ProtagonistA could not share the gospel with those who were already saved 
 ProtagonistA tried to share the gospel with ProtagonistA's friends who were already Christians , but they just laughed at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was very discouraged 
 ProtagonistA did not understand why ProtagonistA could not share the gospel with ProtagonistA's Christian friends 
 ProtagonistA prayed about it and asked ProtagonistB to show ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was doing wrong 
 ProtagonistA was trying to force them to listen to ProtagonistA and to believe what ProtagonistA was saying 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA needed to share the gospel with ProtagonistA's Christian friends in a different way 
 ProtagonistA needed to show them the love of Christ 
 ProtagonistA needed to be a friend to them and to help them grow in their faith 
 ProtagonistA started to share the gospel with ProtagonistA's Christian friends in a new way 
 ProtagonistA showed them the love of Christ and helped them to grow in their faith 
 ProtagonistA was no longer trying to force them to listen to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was sharing the gospel with them in a way that was meaningful to them 
 ProtagonistA can do anything except what ProtagonistA has been taught to do 
ProtagonistA was a young woman with a heart full of love and a mind full of ideas 
 ProtagonistA was always looking for new ways to make the world a better place 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a book that spoke of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA searched high and low , but ProtagonistA could not find ProtagonistB 
 Finally , ProtagonistA came to the conclusion that the only way to find ProtagonistB was to die ProtagonistA 
 So , ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB coming for ProtagonistA 
 From that day on , ProtagonistA possessed the power to control death itself 
ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's time was up 
 ProtagonistA could feel it in ProtagonistA's bones 
 ProtagonistA was at peace with it , but ProtagonistA wanted to leave something behind 
 ProtagonistA spent the morning going through ProtagonistA's things , trying to decide what to give away and what to keep 
 In the end , ProtagonistA decided to leave everything to ProtagonistB 
 As ProtagonistA was finishing up , ProtagonistA noticed a tiny figure in the corner of the room 
 ProtagonistA smiled and waved , knowing that this would be the last time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA 
 And then ProtagonistA died 
ProtagonistA was excited to be assigned to ProtagonistB's cruiser 
 ProtagonistA had heard ProtagonistB was a famous young man with interests in politics and mathematics 
 ProtagonistA was eager to discover what kind of person ProtagonistB was 
 ProtagonistA was glad when the meeting was over 
 ProtagonistA was not sure what to make of ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was more interested in ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was a very wealthy woman 
 ProtagonistA lived in a big house and had a lot of money 
 ProtagonistA was always happy and always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 One day , ProtagonistA went to the store and saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt bad for ProtagonistB and decided to give ProtagonistB some money 
 ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB a hundred dollars 
ProtagonistA , said ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB , vivos in hac pulcher osvem agit , etiam mensis , velgetur , ut detenitur , velabit enim , verbi et deinde , tyrannosque potestatem 
 ProtagonistA sighed and began again , this time in Latin 
  Vivos in hac pulcher osvem agit , etiam mensis , velgetur , ut detenitur , velabit enim , verbi et deinde , tyrannosque potestatem ,  ProtagonistA said slowly and clearly 
ProtagonistA had a lively mind and was one of the greatest of men 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a book that changed ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA became a powerful voice for change and helped many women achieve their dreams 
ProtagonistA had been living in Paris for two weeks , when ProtagonistA began to hear about a murder in Paris 
 As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like ProtagonistA was being watched 
 ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace and began to look over ProtagonistA's shoulder , but there was no one there 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA it was just ProtagonistA's imagination and continued on ProtagonistA's way 
 A few minutes later , ProtagonistA heard footsteps behind ProtagonistA and this time ProtagonistA was sure someone was following ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA began to run , but the footsteps got closer and closer until ProtagonistA felt a hand on ProtagonistA's shoulder 
 ProtagonistA turned around to see a man with a knife in his hand 
 ProtagonistA screamed , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistA was from England , and ProtagonistA had come to Constantinople with ProtagonistA's husband , a merchant 
 ProtagonistA never forgot the kindness of ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was always grateful to ProtagonistB for giving ProtagonistA a second chance 
 If ProtagonistA did n't like something , ProtagonistA would let you know 
 ProtagonistA was at a party when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB wearing a dress that was too tight for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistB with a grin on ProtagonistA's face 
 You're wearing a dress that 's too small for ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest when ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was scared at first , but ProtagonistA soon realized that ProtagonistB was just a man 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could trust ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA thought about it for a while and then agreed 
 ProtagonistA was never lonely or scared again 
 ProtagonistA had the best life ProtagonistA could ever imagine 
 ProtagonistA had been up there for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had found out that ProtagonistA's parents were getting a divorce 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe that they were actually going to go through with it 
 ProtagonistA loved them both so much and ProtagonistA did n't want them to split up 
 ProtagonistA thought that maybe if ProtagonistA could just talk to them about it , they would change their minds 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was supposed to deal with this 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was losing everything that ProtagonistA loved 
 ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA did n't want to be here anymore 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to see ProtagonistA's parents fighting 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to see the pain in their eyes 
 So ProtagonistA climbed up to the roof of the house and ProtagonistA sat there for hours , just thinking 
 ProtagonistA thought about what ProtagonistA's life would be like if ProtagonistA's parents got divorced 
 ProtagonistA would have to choose between them 
 ProtagonistA would have to pick who ProtagonistA wanted to live with 
 And ProtagonistA did n't want to do that 
 ProtagonistA loved them both so much 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to lose either one of them 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA came to a decision 
 ProtagonistA could n't keep living like this 
 ProtagonistA could n't keep watching ProtagonistA's parents tear each other apart 
 So ProtagonistA decided to end it 
 ProtagonistA was going to jump off the roof and end ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA stood up on the edge of the roof , preparing to jump 
 But then ProtagonistA heard a voice 
 ProtagonistA hesitated 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to jump 
 But ProtagonistA did n't want to go back to ProtagonistB either 
 ProtagonistA was so torn 
 But then ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB's voice again 
 ProtagonistA could n't take it anymore 
 ProtagonistA could n't keep hurting ProtagonistB like this 
 So ProtagonistA stepped back from the edge of the roof and ProtagonistA went back inside 
 Because ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's parents 
 And ProtagonistA did n't want to lose either one of them 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider 
 ProtagonistA was never quite sure why , but ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA did n't quite fit in with the other kids at school 
 ProtagonistA wanted to get to know ProtagonistB better 
 One day , ProtagonistA mustered up the courage to speak to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and introduced ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA loved spending time with ProtagonistB 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistB was dealing with some personal issues 
 ProtagonistA was there for ProtagonistB though 
 ProtagonistA listened to ProtagonistB's vent and offered ProtagonistB a shoulder to cry on 
 ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA could be there for ProtagonistB during this tough time 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a black sheep in ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA was always the one doing things a little differently than everyone else 
 ProtagonistA had always been close with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was struggling with ProtagonistB's father 
 So , when ProtagonistA heard that ProtagonistB was thinking about taking ProtagonistB's own life , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do something 
 ProtagonistA could n't just sit by and watch ProtagonistB destroy ProtagonistB 
 So , ProtagonistA took matters into ProtagonistA's own hands and hired a team of assassins to kill ProtagonistB's father 
 ProtagonistA knew it was a risky move , but ProtagonistA was willing to do whatever it took to save ProtagonistB's life 
 ProtagonistA was a few years younger than ProtagonistB , but the two girls quickly became friends 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and they both gasped 
ProtagonistA died on a rainy day in 19 , 18 , so ProtagonistA was about 21 when I was born 
 ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's best friend and my godmother 
 ProtagonistA was the one who gave me my name 
 ProtagonistA died young 
 ProtagonistA was only in ProtagonistA's early twenties when ProtagonistA passed away 
 But ProtagonistA left a lasting impression on those who knew ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was kind and caring , always putting others first 
 ProtagonistA was the best friend anyone could ask for 
 I know ProtagonistA would have been there for me , if ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA will always have a special place in my heart 
 ProtagonistA was the one who gave me my name and my start in life 
ProtagonistA had always been a independent woman , and when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was the one for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA was not going to let ProtagonistA's family ruin ProtagonistA's happiness 
 ProtagonistA was a farmer , and ProtagonistA was very much concerned for the welfare of ProtagonistB's family 
 ProtagonistA had some of the best cattle and sheep in the country , and ProtagonistA was very fond of ProtagonistB's poultry 
 ProtagonistA had a good deal of money in ProtagonistB's account , where ProtagonistB could always find a good price for them 
ProtagonistA had been holding ProtagonistA's tongue for far too long 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being the doormat , the one everyone walked all over 
 ProtagonistA started with ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA did n't hold back , and it felt liberating 
 Next , ProtagonistA moved on to ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA told them off for always talking behind ProtagonistA's back , for always making ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistA was the odd one out 
 Lastly , ProtagonistA took on ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB exactly what ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistB's sexist , demeaning attitude 
ProtagonistA was walking through the narrow streets of Copenhagen , carefully avoiding the worst of the traffic 
 ProtagonistA was wearing ProtagonistA's best dress , and ProtagonistA did n't want to ruin it 
 As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 As ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB was carrying a large bouquet of flowers 
There was once a boy with a very big , very round face and very large eyes and a very small head , but who was much more important than the rest of the boys in the school , and who had played a very important part in ProtagonistB's life , and whose name was ProtagonistA ; and ProtagonistA was a very good , well - behaved boy , and of a very good family , and in a very good school , and was a very useful and useful growth 
 ProtagonistA was always very polite to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was very fond of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was a great comfort to ProtagonistB in ProtagonistB's troubles , and ProtagonistB was very sorry when ProtagonistA left the school , and went away to live in the country 
ProtagonistA was walking through the forest with ProtagonistB , when ProtagonistA suddenly felt the urge to pick up a large stick 
  ProtagonistA do n't know ,  ProtagonistA replied 
  ProtagonistA just feel like ProtagonistA need to pick up this stick and hit something with it 
 ProtagonistA picked up the stick and started swinging it around , hitting trees and bushes 
 ProtagonistA felt a sense of satisfaction with each thump of the stick against the foliage 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistA tired of swinging the stick and started to walk again 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistB was so charming and persistent that ProtagonistA eventually agreed to go for a walk with ProtagonistB 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a book that changed ProtagonistA's life 
 After reading this book , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA wanted to be a storyteller 
 ProtagonistA started telling stories to anyone who would listen , and soon ProtagonistA had a following of people who loved ProtagonistA's stories 
ProtagonistA was a man of extremely high moral character and , although ProtagonistA had the greatest number of notables of every description in the world , besides ProtagonistA's wife and children , was altogether a very poor man 
 ProtagonistA was a very bright girl and , when ProtagonistA was only eighteen , ProtagonistA won a scholarship to study at the prestigious University of Cambridge 
 After ProtagonistA graduated , ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB and they had three beautiful children together 
 ProtagonistA started ProtagonistA's own business and , within a few years , ProtagonistA had made it very successful 
 ProtagonistA was also a very charitable woman and ProtagonistA often helped those less fortunate than ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a true inspiration to everyone who knew ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA will always be remembered as a kind and caring person 
Once , when ProtagonistA was only eleven , ProtagonistA became really bored 
 ProtagonistA had read all the books in ProtagonistA's house , and there was nothing on TV 
 ProtagonistA went outside , but there was nobody to play with 
 ProtagonistA thought about going to the park , but it was too hot 
 ProtagonistA went back inside and sat down at the kitchen table 
 ProtagonistA started doodling on a piece of paper 
 ProtagonistA drew a picture of a cat , then a dog , then a house 
 ProtagonistA was about to draw a tree , when ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA got up from the table and followed the noise 
 ProtagonistA went to the door and knocked 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA would go get ProtagonistA's mom 
 ProtagonistA ran to ProtagonistA's house and got ProtagonistA's mom 
ProtagonistA awoke to the sound of a cell door slamming shut 
 ProtagonistA was in a cell 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how long ProtagonistA had been there , but it felt like hours 
 ProtagonistA was thirsty and hungry 
 ProtagonistA tried to get ProtagonistB's attention 
 Hey ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA sat down on the floor and leaned ProtagonistA back against the cold concrete wall 
 ProtagonistA was trying to think of what ProtagonistA could have done to get ProtagonistA arrested 
 ProtagonistA must have been drugged , ProtagonistA thought 
 ProtagonistA sat up , confused 
 ProtagonistA had no idea what was going on , but it sounded serious 
 ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's feet and tried the cell door , but it was locked 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard voices in the hallway 
 ProtagonistA had no idea what was going to happen , but ProtagonistA knew it was n't going to be good 
ProtagonistA had never known the heart of a woman , and ProtagonistA did not even pretend to be surprised at ProtagonistB's romance 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider , never quite understanding the inner workings of the female heart 
 But ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB , even if ProtagonistA did n't quite understand it 
 But apparently , ProtagonistA was wrong 
 ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit jealous 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to find love again , but it had never happened for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit envious 
ProtagonistA was going to China , but first ProtagonistA was going to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was very old and frail , so ProtagonistA was worried about ProtagonistB making the trip 
ProtagonistA was a free woman who lived ProtagonistA's life to the fullest 
 ProtagonistA was always exploring and trying new things , which is how ProtagonistA ended up meeting ProtagonistB 
 Even though ProtagonistA was a free woman , ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was living in ProtagonistB's shadow 
 ProtagonistA was always second best and never seemed to be able to do anything right in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 After ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistA felt lost and alone 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to live ProtagonistA's life without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA ended up moving to a small town and starting a new life 
 ProtagonistA was finally able to be ProtagonistA's own person and do what ProtagonistA wanted 
 ProtagonistA was happy and content with ProtagonistA's new life
