ProtagonistA was lying on the floor on ProtagonistA's back , rocking back and forth , stretching out ProtagonistA's heels in the air . ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's usual spot , in the middle of the living room , where ProtagonistA had been lying for the past hour . ProtagonistA was wearing ProtagonistA's usual clothes , a pair of faded jeans and a white t - shirt . ProtagonistA's eyes were closed and ProtagonistA's face was turned up to the ceiling . ProtagonistA was lost in thought , as ProtagonistA often was these days . ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how it had led ProtagonistA to this point . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner , never really fitting in anywhere . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a dreamer , always chasing after something that was just out of reach . And now , here ProtagonistA was , lying on the floor in ProtagonistA's rented apartment , with nothing to show for ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was thirty - five years old and ProtagonistA had nothing to show for it . ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a writer , but ProtagonistA had never been able to get anything published .

ProtagonistA loved the act of creating something out of nothing . It was the one thing that made ProtagonistA feel alive . ProtagonistA was snapped out of ProtagonistA's reverie by the sound of ProtagonistA's phone ringing . ProtagonistA reached over and grabbed it , not even bothering to look at the caller ID.Hello ?  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's voice sounding tired even to ProtagonistA's own ears . Hey , ProtagonistA ,  came the reply . It was ProtagonistB .  What are ProtagonistA up to?Nothing much ,  ProtagonistA said .  Just lying on the floor . You sound like ProtagonistA 're in a funk ,  ProtagonistB said .  What 's going on?Bob sighed .  ProtagonistA 'm just feeling a bit down about ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA guess . Hey , it 's not so bad ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA 're a great writer . ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA 'll get published one day . Thanks , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA appreciate the vote of confidence . Any time , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  Listen , ProtagonistB 'm going to grab a beer . ProtagonistA want to join me?Sure ,  ProtagonistA said , getting up off the floor .  ProtagonistA could use a drink . And with that , ProtagonistA's day started to look a little bit brighter .

With ProtagonistB's help , they were able to arrest ProtagonistA's family and bring them to justice . ProtagonistB was glad that ProtagonistB was able to help ProtagonistA , even though ProtagonistB never got the chance to really know ProtagonistA .

Now , what is it ? said ProtagonistC to the old woman who lay on ProtagonistA back in a critical state , trying to escape the vault with ProtagonistA's head down , as if ProtagonistA had suddenly realized what it was ProtagonistA had been planning .

ProtagonistA went to the nearest house and knocked on the door . ProtagonistB answered . ProtagonistA asked if ProtagonistA could come in and warm up . ProtagonistB let ProtagonistA in and introduced ProtagonistB as Sarah . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB's husband was out looking for ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA was looking for ProtagonistC as well . ProtagonistB offered to help ProtagonistA look for ProtagonistC . They went out into the storm and searched for ProtagonistC . After a while , they found ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA was reunited with ProtagonistC and they all went back to ProtagonistB's house . ProtagonistB's husband had returned with ProtagonistC . They all had a warm meal and a good night 's sleep . In the morning , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC left for home . ProtagonistA was very grateful to ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's family for their help . 
.
ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistB's head , and down at ProtagonistB's feet , and said ,  ProtagonistB 'll be ProtagonistB's companion .  Then ProtagonistA went on ProtagonistA's way . 
.
The night ProtagonistA rose from ProtagonistA's deepest sleep ProtagonistA was found by ProtagonistB in the midst of the crowd of people who were gathered below the palace . ProtagonistA was dazed and confused , but ProtagonistB was overjoyed to see ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had been asleep for years , ever since ProtagonistA was a child . ProtagonistB had never given up hope that ProtagonistA would one day wake up . And now , on this night , ProtagonistB had finally done so . The crowd below was cheering and celebrating , as was ProtagonistB . It was a moment of pure joy and happiness . 
.
ProtagonistA had been on the ship for weeks , and was excited to finally be reaching their destination . However , shortly before they arrived , ProtagonistA became ill with cholera . ProtagonistB did everything ProtagonistB could , but ProtagonistA's condition continued to decline . With the ship anchored just a few miles from their destination , ProtagonistB made the difficult decision to leave ProtagonistA behind , in hopes that ProtagonistA would be able to get medical help on shore and save ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was left alone on the ship , with no way to get off . ProtagonistA quickly succumbed to the disease and died , never reaching ProtagonistA's destination . ProtagonistB no doubt felt guilty for the rest of ProtagonistB's life , knowing that ProtagonistB could have saved ProtagonistA but chose not to . ProtagonistA's death was a tragic reminder of the harsh realities of life at sea . 
.
ProtagonistA had been born , with all the tender feelings and memories which ProtagonistA could bear , ProtagonistA in the year of grace 1792 , to Louis the 15th of July , in the parish of St. dernier - sur - Marne , in the town of Port Omega , in the district of the Madonnier family . ProtagonistA had been the only child of ProtagonistA's parents , who were honest and hard - working people , and ProtagonistA had always been a good and obedient son . But when ProtagonistA was about sixteen years old , ProtagonistA's father died , and ProtagonistB , was obliged to take in lodgers to make ends meet . ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to help ProtagonistB , but it was hard for a boy of ProtagonistA's age to earn enough to keep them both . And so it happened that , when ProtagonistA was eighteen years old , ProtagonistA was obliged to go out into the world to seek ProtagonistA's fortune . 
.
ProtagonistA had been drinking with ProtagonistB all evening , and ProtagonistA had been told to go to bed early , for ProtagonistA was going to spend all night with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was excited to spend the night with ProtagonistB , as ProtagonistA had not seen ProtagonistB in many years . However , when ProtagonistA went to bed , ProtagonistB was already asleep . ProtagonistA tried to stay awake , but ProtagonistA eventually fell asleep . 
.
ProtagonistA was a blonde girl with long black hair , and while ProtagonistA knew it was only a possibility that ProtagonistA would one day be all of thirty - two , it did n't matter . The life ProtagonistA had now was perfect , and ProtagonistA was content to live it out as best ProtagonistA could . ProtagonistA had a great job , a loving family , and ProtagonistB . What more could ProtagonistA ask for?As ProtagonistA's birthday approached , ProtagonistA began to feel a sense of dread . ProtagonistA knew that once ProtagonistA turned thirty - two , ProtagonistA's life would change . ProtagonistA would no longer be the carefree young man ProtagonistA was now . ProtagonistA would have to take on more responsibility , and ProtagonistA would have to start thinking about the future . It was a lot to take in , and ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA was ready for it . On the day of ProtagonistA's birthday , ProtagonistA woke up feeling nervous . ProtagonistA had a feeling that something was going to happen , but ProtagonistA did n't know what . ProtagonistA went about ProtagonistA's day as usual , trying to push the feeling out of ProtagonistA's mind . Later that day , ProtagonistB called ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB sounded upset , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had something to tell ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's heart sank . ProtagonistA knew what was coming . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was pregnant . ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA did n't know what to say . ProtagonistA was happy , but ProtagonistA was also scared . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's life was about to change forever . 
.
ProtagonistA was seated on the steps of the throne in the center of the court , ProtagonistA's face pale and ProtagonistA's eyes trembling as ProtagonistA looked down at the golden blade of Agredite in the hands of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that this was the only way to save ProtagonistA's kingdom from the invading army , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like ProtagonistA was signing ProtagonistA's own death warrant . ProtagonistB , looked at ProtagonistA with a mix of pity and resolve . ProtagonistB knew that this was n't what either of them wanted , but it was the only way to save their people . With a heavy heart , ProtagonistA agreed to the marriage and the two were we d . As they walked down the aisle , ProtagonistA could n't help but think of the life ProtagonistA could have had with someone else . But ProtagonistA knew that this was ProtagonistA's duty and ProtagonistA had to see it through . 
.
ProtagonistA was not having a good day . First , ProtagonistA got into a fight with ProtagonistC . Then , ProtagonistA's teacher scolded ProtagonistA in front of the whole class . And to top it all off , ProtagonistB came to visit . ProtagonistA will not we d you ,  said ProtagonistB , with ProtagonistA's tall , dark - haired face flaming red in a way that evoked a funeral pyre . ProtagonistA was so embarrassed and angry that ProtagonistA wanted to just crawl under a rock and die . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was only trying to help , but ProtagonistB's words just made ProtagonistA feel worse . Later that night , ProtagonistA talked to ProtagonistC and made up with ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA also apologized to ProtagonistA's teacher . As for ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA decided to just ignore ProtagonistB . After all , ProtagonistB did n't know anything about ProtagonistA's life . 
.
When ProtagonistA stepped to the lectern , ProtagonistB did not interrupt ProtagonistA's position . ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with a twinkle in ProtagonistB's eye , as if ProtagonistB knew something ProtagonistA did n't . ProtagonistA felt a sudden urge to confess all of ProtagonistA's secrets to ProtagonistB . Instead , ProtagonistA cleared ProtagonistA's throat and began ProtagonistA's speech . 
.
ProtagonistA had been walking the streets for days , ever since ProtagonistA ran away from home . ProtagonistA was 15 now , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could take on the world . ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was going or what ProtagonistA was going to do , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get away from ProtagonistA's abusive father . ProtagonistA had nowhere to go and no one to turn to . One day , as ProtagonistA was walking around aimlessly , ProtagonistA came across a strange looking building . It was old and run down , and it looked like it was about to collapse . But there was something about it that caught ProtagonistA's attention . ProtagonistA walked up to the door and peered inside . It was dark and dusty inside , but ProtagonistA could see a faint light in the distance . ProtagonistA walked towards the light , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized it was coming from a window . ProtagonistA climbed up to the window and looked inside . What ProtagonistA saw surprised ProtagonistA . It was a room , and it looked like it was from another time . ProtagonistA climbed through the window and into the room , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had been transported to another world . The room was filled with old furniture and dusty books , and it looked like it had n't been touched in years . But in the corner of the room , ProtagonistA saw a small bed . And on the bed , there was a sleeping child . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA did n't want to wake the child , but ProtagonistA did n't want to leave them alone in this strange place . ProtagonistA stood there for a moment , unsure of what to do . But then ProtagonistA heard a noise from outside the room . It sounded like someone was coming . ProtagonistA did n't want to be caught , so ProtagonistA quickly hid under the bed . ProtagonistA heard the door to the room open , and then ProtagonistA heard footsteps . Someone was walking around the room , and then they stopped at the bed . ProtagonistA held ProtagonistA's breath , hoping they would n't find ProtagonistA . But then ProtagonistA heard a voice . It was ProtagonistB's voice , and ProtagonistB sounded kind and gentle .  It 's okay , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA can come out . ProtagonistB wo n't hurt ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA slowly crawled out from under the bed and looked at ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was old , but ProtagonistB had a kind face .  Who are ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked . ProtagonistB name is Nightingale ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'm a witch . ProtagonistA did n't know what to say . ProtagonistA had never met a witch before .  What are ProtagonistB doing here ?  ProtagonistA asked . I'm here to help ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA 're in a lot of trouble , and ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB's help . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA could trust ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did n't have anywhere else to turn .  Okay ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'll do whatever ProtagonistB say . ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA .  Good ,  ProtagonistB said .  Now , let 's get ProtagonistA out of here .  
.
On that snowy morning in March , ProtagonistA was walking through the great halls of the castle at the summit of a vast and summaing mount , when ProtagonistA came face to face with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was dressed in a long , flowing robe of crimson and gold , and ProtagonistB's white hair was piled high upon ProtagonistB's head in an intricate arrangement of curls and braids . ProtagonistB was seated in a great throne of carved wood and gilt , and ProtagonistB's hands rested upon the arms of the throne . ProtagonistB regarded ProtagonistA with a piercing gaze , and ProtagonistA felt as if ProtagonistB could see into ProtagonistA's very soul . Who are ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked , ProtagonistB's voice quivering with age but still commanding . I - I'm Bob , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA replied , bowing low . And what brings ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB's castle on this cold day?I - I'm lost , ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was out walking in the forest and ProtagonistA got turned around . ProtagonistA did n't mean to trespass , ProtagonistA swear . ProtagonistB regarded ProtagonistA for a moment , and then ProtagonistB beckoned ProtagonistA closer .  Come sit by the fire , ProtagonistA , and warm ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA must be cold after ProtagonistA's journey . ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA walked forward and seated ProtagonistA in a chair by the fire . ProtagonistB leaned forward , and ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB's eyes were filled with wisdom and compassion . There are many paths through the forest , ProtagonistA , and it is easy to get lost . But if ProtagonistA are lost , all ProtagonistA need to do is ask for directions . Someone will always be happy to help ProtagonistA find ProtagonistA's way . ProtagonistA nodded , and ProtagonistA felt a warmth spreading through ProtagonistA , not just from the fire but from ProtagonistB's words . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB's advice , and ProtagonistA would always be grateful for ProtagonistB's kindness . 
.
On the night of the triumph of God , when the clouds of the tempest were in their most profuse motion , ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's womb , and bearing a son , whose name was John , uttered a pious prayer to St. Fritigern , the King of Germany ; and said , ProtagonistC , according to the divine will , ProtagonistB am now at liberty to choose the mode which most properly belongs to ProtagonistB ; in which , according to ProtagonistC's minds and ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB shall be able to establish ProtagonistB's religion ; and for this purpose ProtagonistB beg leave to make ascertainment of the manner in which ProtagonistB shall assemble ProtagonistB's companions in this city . 
.
It was a beautiful good day in October when ProtagonistA trod into the garden and saw ProtagonistB . The sun was shining and the leaves were falling gently from the trees . ProtagonistB was sitting on a bench , reading a book . ProtagonistB looked up as ProtagonistA approached . Hello , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said , smiling .  It 's a beautiful day , is n't it?Yes , it is ,  ProtagonistA replied . ProtagonistA sat down on the bench next to ProtagonistB .  What are ProtagonistB reading?Oh , just a book ,  ProtagonistB said , showing ProtagonistA the cover .  It 's a romance novel . ProtagonistB love these kinds of books . I can see that ,  ProtagonistA said , chuckling . ProtagonistA leaned back and enjoyed the good weather and the company of ProtagonistB . 
.
At the turn of the last century , when Europe was drifting apart , there lived ProtagonistA , and by the name of Caroline Caroline , or Caroline of Mary , ProtagonistA was called . ProtagonistA was a young man of twenty , with ProtagonistB and two small children . ProtagonistA worked in a factory in Manchester , and ProtagonistB worked as a maid in a large house in London . They were both happy in their work , and their life was comfortable and contented . One day , ProtagonistA was walking home from work , when ProtagonistA saw a group of men standing on the corner , talking and laughing . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that they were talking about a new war that was starting in Europe . ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA had never thought about war before , and ProtagonistA could n't imagine why anyone would want to fight . The next day , ProtagonistA went to work as usual , but ProtagonistA could n't concentrate . All ProtagonistA could think about was the war . ProtagonistA wondered what it would be like , and if ProtagonistA would ever see ProtagonistA's family again . A few days later , ProtagonistA's factory was closed down , and ProtagonistA was out of work . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA had no money , and no way to support ProtagonistA's family . Then , one day , ProtagonistA saw a poster advertising for soldiers to fight in the war . ProtagonistA knew that it was ProtagonistA's duty to fight for ProtagonistA's country , and ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA could make some money to support ProtagonistA's family . ProtagonistA enlisted in the army , and ProtagonistA was sent to France to fight . ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA was also excited . ProtagonistA was going to be a hero . ProtagonistA fought in many battles , and ProtagonistA was wounded several times . But ProtagonistA never gave up , and ProtagonistA never stopped fighting . Eventually , the war ended , and ProtagonistA came home . ProtagonistA was a different man now . ProtagonistA had seen things that ProtagonistA could never have imagined , and ProtagonistA had done things that ProtagonistA never thought ProtagonistA would do . But ProtagonistA was also a hero , and ProtagonistA was proud of what ProtagonistA had done . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB lived happily ever after , and they never forgot the war . They would always remember the friends that they had lost , and the sacrifices that they had made . 
.
ProtagonistA was walking home from work when ProtagonistA noticed a strange light in the sky . It was getting closer and closer , and soon it was right above ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA could see a figure inside the light , and it was speaking to ProtagonistA . The figure told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was chosen to be the saviour of the world . ProtagonistA was given a special mission to complete , and ProtagonistA would be given the power to do it . ProtagonistA was n't sure what to believe , but ProtagonistA knew that this was something ProtagonistA had to do . The figure gave ProtagonistA a sword and told ProtagonistA to go to the nearest city . There ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was to defeat ProtagonistB and free the city . ProtagonistA took the sword and set off on ProtagonistA's journey . ProtagonistA had never felt so alive before . With every step ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's power growing . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could do anything . When ProtagonistA arrived in the city , ProtagonistA could see the fear in the people 's eyes .

The city was saved and the people were free . ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's purpose in life . ProtagonistA was the chosen one , and ProtagonistA would never give up . 
.
ProtagonistA was sitting on the veranda of the front door with ProtagonistA's hands on the knob . It was a hot day and the sun was beating down on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was sweating and ProtagonistA's shirt was sticking to ProtagonistA's back . ProtagonistA was about to go inside when ProtagonistA heard a noise . It sounded like someone was crying . ProtagonistA got up and looked around . ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on the ground with ProtagonistB's head in ProtagonistB's hands . ProtagonistA went over to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what was wrong . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB's husband had left ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB was all alone . ProtagonistA felt sorry for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA invited ProtagonistB inside . ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB a glass of water and a seat on the couch . ProtagonistA sat down next to ProtagonistB and they talked for a while . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistB was welcome to stay with ProtagonistA as long as ProtagonistB needed . 
.
ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA were a family of only two children . They both fell sick with an acute hope of death . ProtagonistA was awaiting the publication of ProtagonistA's work , which was entitled A History of the World . ProtagonistA determined to devote to the study of it all that was worthy of ProtagonistA's mind and to the satisfaction of the human race . ProtagonistB , on the other hand , was consumed with great apprehensions . ProtagonistB was afraid that the world would end before ProtagonistB had a chance to see it . ProtagonistA reassured ProtagonistB that the world would go on long after they were gone . ProtagonistA promised to write a history of it so that ProtagonistB could understand it . ProtagonistB was comforted by this and died peacefully . 
.
ProtagonistA sits cross - legged on the floor of the dark alcove , ProtagonistA's fingers tracing the lines of a small painting . In the painting , ProtagonistB is standing in a field of flowers , ProtagonistB's arms outstretched . The sun is setting behind ProtagonistB , and the sky is a deep , rich blue . ProtagonistA feels a sense of peace and calm whenever ProtagonistA looks at the painting , and ProtagonistA 's been coming to this alcove to look at it every day for the past week . today , as ProtagonistA looks at the painting , ProtagonistA notices something new . There 's a small figure in the background , just to the left of ProtagonistB . It 's a child , ProtagonistA realizes , and they 're reaching out to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA ca n't help but smile at the image , and ProtagonistA feels ProtagonistA's heart fill with warmth . It 's as if the painting is telling ProtagonistA that everything is going to be alright . 
.
ProtagonistA had been looking forward to this day for months . ProtagonistA had been invited to the home of ProtagonistB . This was a huge honor , and ProtagonistA wanted to make a good impression . ProtagonistA spent the morning getting dressed and making sure everything was perfect . ProtagonistA did n't want to make any mistakes . When it was finally time to leave , ProtagonistA took a deep breath and walked out the door . ProtagonistB was very impressed with ProtagonistA . They talked for hours about all sorts of things . ProtagonistA was so excited to be there that ProtagonistA did n't even notice the time passing . Before ProtagonistA knew it , it was time to go . ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for coming and said ProtagonistB hoped to see ProtagonistA again soon . ProtagonistA was absolutely thrilled . This was the best day of ProtagonistA's life . 
.
ProtagonistA was always a bit of an oddball . ProtagonistA's facial features , eye color , and body were all different from the rest of the family . But that did n't stop ProtagonistB from loving ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's facial features , ProtagonistA's eye color , and ProtagonistA's body , said ProtagonistB , are all different . But that 's what makes ProtagonistA special . My father always saw the best in people , and ProtagonistB was always quick to forgive . That 's why ProtagonistA was like a son to ProtagonistB . Even though ProtagonistA was different , ProtagonistA was always happy and always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA was always quick to make friends and was always the life of the party . ProtagonistA was always there for ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB needed someone to talk to . And ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA needed a shoulder to cry on . They say that blood is thicker than water . But in ProtagonistB's case , love was thicker than blood .

The whirling cloak of ProtagonistA slipped from ProtagonistA's fingers and into the arms of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB , had been fighting ProtagonistA for the cloak for hours . It was a magical cloak that would grant the wearer the power of flight . ProtagonistA had been using it to terrorize the villagers , but ProtagonistB had been determined to stop ProtagonistA . The final battle had been fierce , but ProtagonistB had finally triumphed . As ProtagonistB stood there , clutching the cloak to ProtagonistB's chest , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB had to use it to save the village . ProtagonistB flew into the air , ProtagonistA's screams of rage following ProtagonistB , and began to drop the cloak down to the villagers below . With the cloak , they would be able to escape ProtagonistA's tyranny and build a new life for themselves . ProtagonistB flew back to the village , a sense of pride and satisfaction swelling in ProtagonistB's chest . ProtagonistB had saved them all . 
.
ProtagonistA had been thinking all night and ProtagonistA 'd been stumped ever since . ProtagonistA just could n't figure out what to get ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's birthday . ProtagonistA thought and thought , but nothing came to mind . ProtagonistA was starting to get frustrated . ProtagonistA got up from the table and paced around the room . Maybe ProtagonistA could go for a walk and clear ProtagonistA's head . That 's when ProtagonistA had an idea . ProtagonistA could get ProtagonistB a gift certificate to ProtagonistB's favorite store . ProtagonistB would love that . ProtagonistA was so happy with ProtagonistA's idea that ProtagonistA went to the store right away and got the certificate . ProtagonistB was thrilled with ProtagonistB's present . 
.
ProtagonistA had been very wrong in ProtagonistA's belief that I would ever be with anyone , or marry anyone . ProtagonistA had seen me with many different men over the years , and I had never been serious with any of them . I was always the one who was moving on to the next guy , never looking back . ProtagonistA just assumed that I would never settle down . But then I met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was different than any other guy I had ever been with . I actually felt like I could see a future with ProtagonistB . We started dating seriously and then we got married . ProtagonistA was at our wedding and ProtagonistA was happy for me , even though ProtagonistA had been wrong about me . 
.
ProtagonistA was out for a walk in the woods when ProtagonistA came across a bush . On the bush was a turnip , and on the turnip was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had never seen ProtagonistB before , but ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB somewhere before . ProtagonistB spoke to ProtagonistA and asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was doing in the woods . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA was out for a walk and enjoying the nature . ProtagonistB then asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA wanted to play a game . ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but then ProtagonistA agreed . The game was simple . ProtagonistB would ask ProtagonistA a question , and if ProtagonistA answered correctly , ProtagonistA would get a point . If ProtagonistA answered incorrectly , ProtagonistB would get a point . The first person to five points would win . ProtagonistA went first . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB's name was . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's name was Tim . ProtagonistA then asked ProtagonistB where ProtagonistB lived . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB lived in the woods . ProtagonistA was about to ask another question when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had won the game . 
.
ProtagonistA had a habit of making a speech with all the amazing clarity , propriety , and rationalism of a genius , and almost the same effect , when ProtagonistA had finished , as when ProtagonistA had finished ; for ProtagonistA was always going on about something , ever since ProtagonistA had heard it described to ProtagonistA . This time , ProtagonistA was going on about the time ProtagonistA had met ProtagonistB . It was the most amazing thing that has ever happened to ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA was just walking along , minding ProtagonistA's own business , when ProtagonistA came across a lamp . ProtagonistA picked it up and rubbed it , and out popped ProtagonistB . At first ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistB was really friendly . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would grant ProtagonistA three wishes . ProtagonistA did n't know what to wish for at first , but then ProtagonistA thought of the perfect thing . ProtagonistA wished that ProtagonistA could always make speeches like a genius . And , granted , ever since then ProtagonistA 've been able to do just that . ProtagonistA can stand up in front of any audience and just speak off the top of ProtagonistA's head , and they 'll all be hanging on ProtagonistA's every word . It 's been great , but there is one downside . Because ProtagonistA 'm always speaking like a genius , people expect ProtagonistA to be one . They expect ProtagonistA to be able to solve all their problems , and sometimes ProtagonistA just ca n't do that . But ProtagonistA guess that 's a price ProtagonistA 'm willing to pay for the ability to make amazing speeches .  
.
ProtagonistA was in a large room on the first floor . ProtagonistB had planned to put ProtagonistA in the interests of peace , but ProtagonistB decided not to leave ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was happy to be left alone in the room and ProtagonistA soon fell asleep . 
.
ProtagonistA was walking through town on the left hand side of the road when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA stopped and stared for a moment . ProtagonistB noticed ProtagonistA staring and gave ProtagonistA a dirty look before walking away . ProtagonistA was so confused and curious that ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB for a few blocks until ProtagonistB turned down an alleyway . ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then decided to follow ProtagonistB . When ProtagonistA turned down the alley , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB talking to a man in the shadows . They seemed to be arguing about something , but ProtagonistA could n't hear what they were saying . ProtagonistB suddenly turned and saw ProtagonistA watching them . ProtagonistB said something to the man and then started walking towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was so scared that ProtagonistA turned and ran the other way . ProtagonistA did n't stop running until ProtagonistA got home . ProtagonistA was so breathless and panting that ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA what was wrong . ProtagonistA tried to tell ProtagonistC about ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was so shaken up that ProtagonistA could n't get the words out . ProtagonistC just hugged ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA it was okay . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB's face . It was so strange and haunting . 
.
ProtagonistA had been in prison for years , and ProtagonistA was getting tired of it . Every day was the same , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA was going crazy . ProtagonistA had tried to escape a few times , but it never worked . One day , ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's cell , wondering if there was anything left for ProtagonistA in the world . ProtagonistA was getting old , and ProtagonistA did n't know how much longer ProtagonistA could take it . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise outside ProtagonistA's cell . ProtagonistA got up to see what it was , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB coming towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB have some bad news . The warden wants to see ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew what that meant . ProtagonistA was going to be executed . ProtagonistA had heard of prisoners being executed before , and ProtagonistA did n't want to die . ProtagonistA begged ProtagonistB to let ProtagonistA go , but ProtagonistB just laughed and said ,  Sorry , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 're going to have to face the consequences of ProtagonistA's actions . ProtagonistA was led to the execution chamber , and ProtagonistA saw the electric chair . ProtagonistA knew that was going to be ProtagonistA's fate . ProtagonistA was strapped into the chair , and the last thing ProtagonistA heard was ProtagonistB saying ,  Sleeping is a bitch , said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistB opened the door of ProtagonistA's old , badly needed and ragged cell .  
.
They found ProtagonistA in a little room on the second floor of an apartment building , laying with ProtagonistA's eyes fixed upon a television screen , ProtagonistA's hands resting upon the table . ProtagonistA was wearing a pair of dirty jeans and a stained white t - shirt . The room was cluttered with empty beer cans and takeaway wrappers . The only furniture was a battered old armchair and the table that ProtagonistA was laying on .

There was once ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had the worst fear of anything in the world , and the most abiding love of anything in the world to abandon . ProtagonistA fancied ProtagonistA had seen everything when ProtagonistA was a little old man . When ProtagonistA was younger , ProtagonistA had seen the world and all its wonders . ProtagonistA had seen the beauty of the sunsets and the majesty of the mountains . ProtagonistA had seen the kindness of strangers and the love of friends . But as ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to see the ugliness of the world . ProtagonistA saw the cruelty of people and the violence of nature . ProtagonistA saw the poverty and the disease . ProtagonistA saw the hatred and the bigotry . And ProtagonistA saw the death and destruction . All of these things terrified ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA began to fear for ProtagonistA's own life .

One day , as ProtagonistA stood in the garden of ProtagonistA's father 's house , tracing the outlines of the structure ProtagonistA had built there on the foundations of the old stone house , the man who would become known as the Great Scribe of the Old Testament , or , as some people called ProtagonistB , the Habite Cretan , or simply the Lost Scribe , began to write . ProtagonistB had been wandering the earth for many years , and in that time ProtagonistB had seen and written down the history of many people and places . But now , ProtagonistB felt , it was time to write ProtagonistB's own story . ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer , and when ProtagonistA was younger ProtagonistA would often spend hours in the garden , imagining what it would be like to build ProtagonistA's own house there . ProtagonistA's father had always told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could build whatever ProtagonistA wanted , as long as ProtagonistA used the old stone house as the foundation . And so that 's what ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA spent months working on the house , and when it was finished ProtagonistA was very proud of it . It was n't the biggest or most impressive house in the world , but it was ProtagonistA , and it was perfect for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA for some time , and ProtagonistB was impressed by ProtagonistA's determination and creativity . ProtagonistB decided to write about ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistB began to follow ProtagonistA around , chronicling everything ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA was unaware of ProtagonistB's presence , and ProtagonistA went about ProtagonistA's life as usual . ProtagonistA worked hard , and ProtagonistA played hard . ProtagonistA made friends and enemies . ProtagonistA laughed and ProtagonistA cried . And through it all , ProtagonistB was there , writing it all down .

ProtagonistA got married , and ProtagonistA had children . ProtagonistA achieved great things , and ProtagonistA made mistakes . But through it all , ProtagonistA remained the same dreamer ProtagonistA had always been . And ProtagonistB continued to write , until the day ProtagonistA died . ProtagonistA was an old man then , but ProtagonistA still had a twinkle in ProtagonistA's eye . And as ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's last breath , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB had written the story of a truly great man . 
.
ProtagonistA was the god of the seas , and a man like ProtagonistB had a hard time determining ProtagonistB's true identity . ProtagonistB had been worshipped by the ancient Greeks and Romans , and ProtagonistB's power was said to be second only to that of Poseidon . But ProtagonistB did n't feel like a god . ProtagonistB felt like a man who had been lost at sea for far too long . ProtagonistB had first surfaced during the reign of the Roman Empire . ProtagonistB had no memory of who ProtagonistB was or how ProtagonistB got there , but ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB was different from the other gods . ProtagonistB could control the waves and the creatures of the sea , but ProtagonistB could n't control ProtagonistB's own emotions . ProtagonistB was angry and lost , and ProtagonistB did n't know how to find ProtagonistB's way home . ProtagonistB wandered the earth for centuries , searching for a place to belong . ProtagonistB tried to find ProtagonistB's way back to the sea , but it was always just out of reach . ProtagonistB met other gods and goddesses , but none of them could help ProtagonistB . They all told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB was the god of the seas and that ProtagonistB belonged there , but ProtagonistB did n't believe them . Finally , ProtagonistB met ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was a mortal , but ProtagonistC had a kind heart . ProtagonistC helped ProtagonistB to see that ProtagonistB was still the god of the seas , and that ProtagonistB's power was something to be celebrated , not feared . With ProtagonistC's help , ProtagonistB was finally able to find ProtagonistB's way home .

ProtagonistA was a simple man who lived a simple life . ProtagonistA worked hard to support ProtagonistA's family and never asked for anything in return . So when ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB wanted a new dress , ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to go out and buy it for ProtagonistB . Little did ProtagonistA know that the dress would cost ProtagonistA more than just money . The woman at the store demanded twenty - five dollars for the dress , but ProtagonistA could hardly have imagined that ProtagonistA 'd be obliged to pay that much . ProtagonistA begrudgingly handed over the money and went home , feeling like ProtagonistA 'd been taken advantage of . When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistB was thrilled with the dress and thanked ProtagonistA profusely . But ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like ProtagonistA 'd been duped . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA 'd never be able to look at that dress the same way again . 
.
ProtagonistA was a simple man , and ProtagonistA found great comfort in the simple things in life . One of ProtagonistA's favorite things to do was to read The Origin of Species , and ProtagonistA was particularly fond of the appendix . On this particular afternoon , ProtagonistA was working ProtagonistA's way through the appendix , and ProtagonistA was so engrossed in it that ProtagonistA did n't even notice the cold January weather . ProtagonistA was so wrapped up in ProtagonistA's book that ProtagonistA did n't even hear the sound of ProtagonistB . It was n't until ProtagonistB was right next to ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA finally looked up . When ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was startled , and ProtagonistA quickly got to ProtagonistA's feet . ProtagonistA was n't sure what to make of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was something important . ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's big , brown eyes , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistB was trying to tell ProtagonistA something . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , so ProtagonistA just stood there and waited . After a few moments , ProtagonistB finally spoke .  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA's help ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB's name is Henry , and ProtagonistB 'm a horse from the future . ProtagonistB 've come back in time to stop a war from happening , but ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA's help . ProtagonistA was surprised , but ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to help . ProtagonistA agreed to go with ProtagonistB , and the two of them set off on their adventure . They rode for hours , and ProtagonistA was amazed by everything that ProtagonistA saw . ProtagonistA had never been on a horse before , and ProtagonistA was amazed at how fast they could go . Eventually , they arrived at a small town . ProtagonistA could see the smoke rising from the chimneys , and ProtagonistA could hear the sound of gunfire in the distance . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that this was the town where the war was going to start , and that they needed to stop it . ProtagonistA did n't know how they were going to do that , but ProtagonistA trust ProtagonistB . The two of them rode into town , and they quickly found themselves in the middle of a battle . ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to help . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB worked together to stop the fighting , and eventually they were successful . The war was over , and ProtagonistA had helped to save the future . ProtagonistA was a hero , and ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistA's adventure with ProtagonistB .

ProtagonistA was a dull boy , but not to the point of being a loner , except in the locality where ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , an aunt , and a cousin ; and as ProtagonistA was such a person , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA quite agreeable to everybody , even to the great majority of ProtagonistA's elders . However , there was one thing that ProtagonistA was very particular about , and that was ProtagonistA's hair . ProtagonistA was always very careful to keep it neat and tidy , and ProtagonistA never allowed anybody to touch it . ProtagonistB , was not allowed to cut it . So you can imagine how surprised everybody was when , one day , ProtagonistA went into ProtagonistB's shop and said ,  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA want ProtagonistB to cut ProtagonistA's hair .  ProtagonistB was so pleased that ProtagonistB immediately set to work , and when ProtagonistB had finished , ProtagonistA's hair looked just as it always did , neat and tidy . But when ProtagonistA's aunt and cousin saw ProtagonistA , they were both very much surprised .  ProtagonistA , why have ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's hair cut ?  they asked .  ProtagonistA do n't know ,  ProtagonistA replied .  ProtagonistA just felt like it .  
.
ProtagonistB was waiting for ProtagonistA , just as ProtagonistA usually was . But today , ProtagonistA was late . ProtagonistB waited and waited , but ProtagonistA never showed up . ProtagonistB began to worry . What could have happened to ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistB tried calling ProtagonistA's phone , but there was no answer . ProtagonistB hoped ProtagonistA was okay . 
.
It was not long before ProtagonistA felt he mentioned in whispers of name and nationality . ProtagonistA had only been in the small town for a few weeks , but it seemed like everyone knew who ProtagonistA was and where ProtagonistA was from . ProtagonistA tried to keep to ProtagonistA , but it was difficult when everyone was always talking about ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt like a zoo animal on display . One day , ProtagonistA went into the local grocery store and ProtagonistB started chatting with ProtagonistA about ProtagonistA's home country . ProtagonistA was polite , but ProtagonistA just wanted to finish ProtagonistA's shopping and go home . As ProtagonistA was leaving , ProtagonistA overheard ProtagonistB whispering to the customer next to ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA 's from that country that 's always in the news . You know , the one with all the problems . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's face flush with anger , but ProtagonistA just gritted ProtagonistA's teeth and walked out of the store . ProtagonistA was tired of being judged and talked about . ProtagonistA was just a person , just like everyone else . The next day , ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's belongings and left the town . ProtagonistA was done with being the center of attention and ProtagonistA did n't want to be anywhere that ProtagonistA was n't welcome . 
.
ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , and when ProtagonistA was five years old ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB a name . ProtagonistB was a big , friendly dog who loved to play fetch . ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB ProtagonistB because ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's favorite name . ProtagonistB quickly became a part of the family and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly .

ProtagonistA got up to see what was going on and found ProtagonistA in the Court of the Tuileries . There , in the middle of the court , was ProtagonistB crying over a body . ProtagonistA recognized the body as ProtagonistA's own . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA had gotten there , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was dead . ProtagonistA could see the light starting to fade from ProtagonistA's own eyes . But as ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA felt a sudden surge of love and compassion for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA . And in that moment , ProtagonistA was content . 
.
One day , soon after ProtagonistA had become a full - grown man , Mr. Samuel Church of the City College of that city caressed ProtagonistA's nose and said , with a smile over his mouth ,  I do n't suppose he've ever heard of ProtagonistB ?

ProtagonistA was a very distrustful person . ProtagonistA never trusted anyone , not even in the most extreme times of ProtagonistA's life .

This made ProtagonistA a very lonely person , but ProtagonistA never let anyone get close to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always afraid that they would hurt ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA was walking through the forest and ProtagonistA came across a small cottage . There was ProtagonistB .

.
ProtagonistA had been reading aloud from the ' History of the United States of America ' when ProtagonistA noticed a word in a Latin text on the back page . The word was ' eternus , ' and it caught ProtagonistA's attention because it was the same word ProtagonistB had used to describe ProtagonistB's love for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA wondered if the word meant ' forever ' in Latin , and if so , whether ProtagonistB had known that ProtagonistA would one day be reading about the history of the United States in a Latin text . 
.
ProtagonistA approached the throne upon an armchair not as a king , but as a dandy , ProtagonistA a success , but no more than a short - cut , with ProtagonistB at full term , ProtagonistA sat down to lunch , and took a stool in the sofas on the other side of the table . ProtagonistA had been planning to leave ProtagonistB for weeks , but now that ProtagonistB was pregnant , ProtagonistA did n't have the heart to do it . ProtagonistB had been ProtagonistA's rock during the tough times and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't do it without ProtagonistB . So ProtagonistA sat there , eating ProtagonistA's lunch and looking at ProtagonistB , wondering how ProtagonistA could ever leave ProtagonistB . 
.
There was once ProtagonistA , for there can be no doubt that it was to ProtagonistA a kind of great privilege and a great misfortune that ProtagonistA was to have lived until the day ProtagonistA died a free man .

ProtagonistA wandered the streets , living off the charity of others . One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA went to the address ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA at the doorstep of a brothel . ProtagonistA went inside , and ProtagonistA was given a room and a bed . ProtagonistA was given food and drink , and ProtagonistA was given the company of the prostitutes . ProtagonistA was given a job cleaning the floors and doing the laundry . ProtagonistA was happy there , and ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA had found a home .

.
ProtagonistB had always been a bit of a recluse , preferring to stay inside the house rather than venture out into the cold winter weather . This year , however , was different . For the first time , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB leave the house , bundled up in a heavy coat and scarf . ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB walked down the street , looking around at the snow - covered houses and trees . It was as if ProtagonistB was seeing them for the first time . ProtagonistA was curious to know what had prompted ProtagonistB to finally leave the house after all these years . ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB at a distance , not wanting to intrude on whatever it was that ProtagonistB was doing . ProtagonistA was surprised when ProtagonistB turned down a street that ProtagonistA had never been down before . It was a dead - end street , with only a few houses on it . At the end of the street was a small park . ProtagonistB sat down on a bench and stared out at the empty park . It was as if ProtagonistB was lost in thought . After a few minutes , ProtagonistB got up and walked back the way ProtagonistB had come . ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB , but this time ProtagonistB did n't seem to notice ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB walked straight back to the house and went inside , never once looking back . ProtagonistA was left wondering what ProtagonistB had been thinking about in that park . It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever seen ProtagonistB leave the house , and ProtagonistA was n't sure what to make of it . Was it the first step of ProtagonistB coming out of ProtagonistB's shell , or was it simply a one - time thing ? Either way , ProtagonistA was happy to have seen ProtagonistB finally venture out into the world . 
.
ProtagonistA was always different . ProtagonistA did n't share a room with your mom or your brother or any of that stuff that everybody does .  said ProtagonistB , turning ProtagonistB's chair around to face the floor . ProtagonistA was always alone , and ProtagonistA liked it that way . ProtagonistA did n't need anybody else . But one day , everything changed . ProtagonistA met somebody who changed ProtagonistA's whole perspective on life . Suddenly , ProtagonistA did n't want to be alone anymore . ProtagonistA wanted to be with this person all the time . And that 's how ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistA loved spending time with people after all .

ProtagonistB lay on the floor of the cooler with ProtagonistA's ears propped up and ProtagonistA's hooves on ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistB had been in there for hours , and ProtagonistB was starting to feel a bit claustrophobic . ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB had to stay calm , though , or else ProtagonistA would start to panic . ProtagonistB tried to focus on the sound of ProtagonistA's breathing , but it was difficult with the constant drip , drip , drip of the water from the leaky faucet . Suddenly , ProtagonistB heard a noise outside the cooler and ProtagonistB's heart started to race . Someone was coming !

ProtagonistA was having a great day . ProtagonistA woke up early and went for a run , then ate a healthy breakfast . ProtagonistA was about to head out the door when ProtagonistA got a call from ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB sounded upset and asked if ProtagonistB could come over . ProtagonistA agreed , and within an hour , ProtagonistB was at ProtagonistA's door . ProtagonistB came in and sat down , not meeting ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong , but ProtagonistB did n't answer . After a few minutes of awkward silence , ProtagonistA finally said ,  ProtagonistB , what 's going on ? ProtagonistB 're making ProtagonistA really nervous . ProtagonistB took a deep breath and finally looked at ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB tried to kill ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'm so sorry , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB do n't know what came over ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was stunned . ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistB had tried to kill ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB why , but ProtagonistB did n't have an answer . They sat in silence for a long time , until ProtagonistA finally said ,  ProtagonistA forgave ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB . But ProtagonistA do n't think ProtagonistA can ever forget what ProtagonistB did .  
.
ProtagonistA was sitting on ProtagonistA's bed , knitting a sweater for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been working on it for weeks , and it was finally finished . ProtagonistA was just about to put the finishing touches on it when ProtagonistA heard a knock at ProtagonistA's door . ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and there was ProtagonistB , standing there with a big smile on ProtagonistB's face . Hey , ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistA were making ProtagonistB a sweater and ProtagonistB wanted to thank ProtagonistA in person . It 's really sweet of ProtagonistA . You're welcome , ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistB like it . I'm sure ProtagonistB will . Thanks again . And with that , ProtagonistB was gone . ProtagonistA sat back down on ProtagonistA's bed , a satisfied smile on ProtagonistA's face . It felt good to know that ProtagonistA had made someone happy . 
.
ProtagonistA was sitting cross - legged on the edge of the porch , ProtagonistA's eyes fixed on the tree closest to ProtagonistA . It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining .

ProtagonistA had always been a bookworm , so it was no surprise that ProtagonistA's favorite spot to relax was in ProtagonistA's library . ProtagonistA had every book imaginable , and ProtagonistA loved them all equally . But there was ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was Twilight . ProtagonistB was sitting on ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's most prized possession , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly . But as ProtagonistA sat there , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little sad . ProtagonistA was always the one who was short on time , and ProtagonistA never had enough time to read all of ProtagonistA's books . But ProtagonistA was content , because at least ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistB's eyes went wide in alarm as ProtagonistA spun , ProtagonistA's hooves shaking in the blackness . ProtagonistB had never seen ProtagonistA move so fast , and ProtagonistB was worried that ProtagonistA would hurt ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistA just kept spinning , faster and faster , until ProtagonistA was a blur . Finally , ProtagonistA stopped and collapsed to the ground , panting . ProtagonistB rushed to ProtagonistA's side , but ProtagonistA just laughed and said ,  That was fun ! Can ProtagonistA do it again ?  
.
ProtagonistB had always been there for ProtagonistA , understanding ProtagonistA better than anyone else . Even when ProtagonistA was at ProtagonistA's worst , ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA . It was because of this that ProtagonistA was able to get through some of the hardest times in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistB always knew what to say to ProtagonistA and when to say it . ProtagonistB was always there to listen to ProtagonistA and to help ProtagonistA through whatever ProtagonistA was going through . ProtagonistB was the only person who truly understood ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was grateful for that . Without ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would not be the person ProtagonistA is today . ProtagonistA is grateful for ProtagonistB's guidance and support throughout ProtagonistA's life . 
.
ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes and ProtagonistB had been pacing the downstairs hallway for hours , still staring up at the giant dragon sitting on the doorstep . The dragon had been there for days , ever since ProtagonistB had made a wish on a shooting star . ProtagonistB had wished for a dragon of ProtagonistB's own and , apparently , ProtagonistB's wish had come true . But now , ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes and ProtagonistB was getting impatient . ProtagonistB want ProtagonistB's cupcake now !  ProtagonistB demanded , stamping ProtagonistB's foot . ProtagonistA sighed . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was n't going to budge until ProtagonistB got ProtagonistB's cupcake , so ProtagonistA might as well give in and get ProtagonistB's one . ProtagonistA went to the kitchen and got a cupcake from the cupcake tree . ProtagonistA brought it to ProtagonistB and , sure enough , ProtagonistB immediately stopped pacing and began to eat it . Thank ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said , with ProtagonistB's mouth full of cupcake . ProtagonistA just shook ProtagonistA's head and went back to the kitchen . ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes and ProtagonistB had a dragon on the doorstep , but at least ProtagonistB was happy . 
.
Sometime in the early seventies ProtagonistA was working at a dress shop when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB working there . ProtagonistB was always smiling and seemed to enjoy ProtagonistB's job . One day , ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB how ProtagonistB liked working at the dress shop . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB loved it and that it was a great place to work . ProtagonistA was surprised to hear this and asked ProtagonistB why ProtagonistB liked it so much . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB loved the people ProtagonistB worked with and that they were like family to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistB's words and decided to ask ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB would like to work at the dress shop with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB said yes and ProtagonistA was happy to have ProtagonistB on board . 
.
From the top of a high mountain , ProtagonistA , naturally , waited for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be coming soon and ProtagonistA wanted to be the first one to greet ProtagonistB . After all , it had been a long time since they had seen each other . As ProtagonistA waited , ProtagonistA could n't help but think about all the things they had been through together . ProtagonistA remembered the time when they were both lost in the forest and how ProtagonistB had found the way back home . ProtagonistA also remembered the time when ProtagonistB had saved ProtagonistA from a group of bullies . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA , no matter what . Finally , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB coming up the path . ProtagonistB was carrying a big backpack and ProtagonistB looked a little tired , but ProtagonistB was still smiling . When ProtagonistB reached the top , ProtagonistB hugged ProtagonistA tightly . I'm so glad to see ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said . I'm glad to see ProtagonistB too , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA replied . Then they sat down and talked about all the things that had happened since they last saw each other . It was great to be reunited with ProtagonistB again . 
.
Rainbow Dash , through the thickets of underbrush , through the smog , through the deep dark , lay in the dimness of ProtagonistA's chambers , ProtagonistA's head on ProtagonistA's hooves . ProtagonistA was tired from ProtagonistA's journey and wanted to rest , but ProtagonistA could not . ProtagonistA was too anxious about what lay ahead . ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistB and save ProtagonistB from the evil Bob . ProtagonistA had to be brave . ProtagonistA stood up and continued ProtagonistA's search . 
.
ProtagonistA had just finished eating dinner with ProtagonistA's family and was walking down the aisle of the car park of the local church when the first thing ProtagonistA noticed was ProtagonistB looking back at ProtagonistA from the rear window . ProtagonistB was an old friend of ProtagonistA's father , and ProtagonistB had been asking ProtagonistA for help with a story ProtagonistB was working on . ProtagonistA agreed to help , and the two of them walked to ProtagonistB's car . ProtagonistB explained that ProtagonistB was working on a story about a local politician who was taking bribes . ProtagonistB had been following the politician for weeks , and ProtagonistB had finally gotten enough evidence to prove ProtagonistB's case . ProtagonistA agreed to help ProtagonistB get the story published . The two of them drove to the newspaper office and dropped off the evidence . ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help , and ProtagonistA went home . 
.
ProtagonistA had been thinking all day if ProtagonistA 'd ever had the chance to speak to ProtagonistB again . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB dearly and regretted not speaking to ProtagonistB more often when ProtagonistB was alive . Suddenly , the phone rang and it was ProtagonistB on the other end ! They chatted for hours , catching up on all that had happened since they last spoke . It was like no time had passed at all . ProtagonistA was so grateful to have the chance to speak to ProtagonistB again and tell ProtagonistB how much ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistA had never been a particularly violent person . In fact , in ProtagonistA's younger and more vulnerable years , ProtagonistA had never held a weapon above ProtagonistA's head . That all changed when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a strong and independent woman who did n't take any crap from anyone . ProtagonistB taught ProtagonistA how to stand up for ProtagonistA and how to use a gun . Now , ProtagonistA was no longer a pushover . ProtagonistA was a man to be reckoned with . 
.
One morning , as the sun was leaking its last faint rays , ProtagonistA heard the bell ring , and while ProtagonistA was still in the kitchen preparing the breakfast that ProtagonistA 'd have for ProtagonistA's grandkids for the holidays , ProtagonistA was n't looking out of the kitchen window . By the time ProtagonistA got to the door , there was no one there , but ProtagonistA could 've sworn ProtagonistA heard footsteps running away . ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and went back inside , thinking ProtagonistA must be getting old and senile . But then ProtagonistA noticed that the window in the living room was open , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had n't left it that way . ProtagonistA's heart started to race as ProtagonistA realized that someone had been in ProtagonistA's house while ProtagonistA was cooking . ProtagonistA quickly ran to the window and looked out , but there was no sign of anyone . ProtagonistA was about to call the police when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the kitchen . Someone was still in ProtagonistA's house ! ProtagonistA crept quietly towards the kitchen , heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest , and peeked around the corner . There , standing in ProtagonistA's kitchen , was ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB back to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was rummaging through ProtagonistA's cupboards , and ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistB must be looking for something . ProtagonistA was about to call out to ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB suddenly turned around , and their eyes met . For a moment , they just stared at each other , neither of them knowing what to say . And then , in a flash , ProtagonistB was gone , running out the door and disappearing into the night . ProtagonistA was shaken , but ProtagonistA was also relieved . Whoever ProtagonistB was , ProtagonistB had n't taken anything . ProtagonistA was just glad ProtagonistB was gone . ProtagonistA went to the window and looked out one last time , but there was still no sign of ProtagonistB . Whoever ProtagonistB was , ProtagonistB was long gone . ProtagonistA sighed and went back to the kitchen to finish making breakfast for ProtagonistA's grandkids . 
.
Twilight is there . ProtagonistA 's laughing ProtagonistA's butt off . ProtagonistB 's just standing there , looking at ProtagonistA like ProtagonistA 's crazy . But ProtagonistA ca n't help it- something about ProtagonistB just makes ProtagonistA want to laugh . ProtagonistB 's probably wondering why ProtagonistA 's laughing , but ProtagonistA does n't care . ProtagonistA 's just happy to be there , with ProtagonistB , in the moment . 
.
ProtagonistA lay down on ProtagonistA's hooves and reached for ProtagonistA's glass of juice . ProtagonistA was a little horse , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's juice . ProtagonistA drank it all the time . But today , ProtagonistA did n't feel so good . ProtagonistA's stomach hurt , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to throw up . ProtagonistA tried to drink ProtagonistA's juice , but ProtagonistA could n't keep it down . ProtagonistA lay there for a while , feeling sick . Then ProtagonistA heard someone coming . It was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB came over and saw that ProtagonistA was sick . ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC said that ProtagonistA had a stomach virus and needed to stay hydrated . ProtagonistC gave ProtagonistA some medicine and told ProtagonistB to give ProtagonistA lots of fluids . ProtagonistB did , and ProtagonistA started to feel better . Soon , ProtagonistA was back to drinking ProtagonistA's juice and being ProtagonistA's happy self again . 
.
ProtagonistA was asleep and thinking about food when ProtagonistA awoke to the sound of hooves approaching from behind the deep , dark , still trees of Equestria . ProtagonistA slowly stood up , ProtagonistA's stomach grumbling , and turned to see ProtagonistB trotting towards ProtagonistA . Hello there !  ProtagonistB said in a friendly voice .  ProtagonistB's name is Twilight Sparkle . ProtagonistB was just out for a walk and ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistA's stomach growling . Are ProtagonistA hungry?Bob 's stomach answered for ProtagonistA with a loud rumble . ProtagonistB smiled and produced a bag of apples from thin air . Here ProtagonistA go !  ProtagonistB said , handing the bag to ProtagonistA .  Enjoy!With that , ProtagonistB trotted away , leaving ProtagonistA to enjoy ProtagonistA's feast . ProtagonistA sat down and began munching on the juicy apples , feeling grateful for ProtagonistB's help . 
.
ProtagonistA had had enough of telling ProtagonistB's story for a while now . It was the same story , over and over again . How ProtagonistB had met ProtagonistA's father , how they had fallen in love , how they had gotten married . ProtagonistA had heard it so many times that ProtagonistA could recite it ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistB loved telling the story . It was ProtagonistB's favorite thing to do . And so , every time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB would ask ProtagonistA to listen to ProtagonistB's story again . And every time , ProtagonistA would oblige . But today , ProtagonistA had had enough . ProtagonistA did n't want to hear the story again . ProtagonistA wanted to do something else . ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA 'm sorry , but ProtagonistA do n't want to hear ProtagonistB's story again . ProtagonistA 'm tired of it . Can we do something else today?Bob 's mother was taken aback . ProtagonistB did n't know what to say . ProtagonistB had never been told that before . I'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB just love telling that story . It 's ProtagonistB's favorite thing to do . ProtagonistB 'll understand if ProtagonistA do n't want to listen to it again , but can we at least do something else together ProtagonistA thought for a moment . ProtagonistA did n't want to hurt ProtagonistB's feelings . Okay , ProtagonistB . Let 's do something else today . And so , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB spent the day doing other things together . They went for a walk , played some games , and just enjoyed each other 's company . It was a nice change for both of them . 
.
It was a warm afternoon in April , the watch of the royal court being to witness the first trial of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB had been caught and tried for ProtagonistB's crimes , but ProtagonistA had managed to escape . However , the king 's men had finally caught up with ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was now standing trial for ProtagonistA's crimes . The court was packed , everyone eager to see how the trial would play out . ProtagonistA was brought into the room , ProtagonistA's hands and feet shackled . ProtagonistA was wearing a dirty , ragged tunic , and ProtagonistA's hair was matted and greasy . ProtagonistA looked like a wild animal , and the crowd jeered and booed as ProtagonistA was led to the stand . ProtagonistA stood before the court , ProtagonistA's head held high . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was innocent , and ProtagonistA was determined to prove it . ProtagonistC began to list ProtagonistA's crimes , but ProtagonistA interrupted ProtagonistC .  ProtagonistA am innocent of all charges !  ProtagonistA shouted .  ProtagonistB was the one who committed the crimes , not me!The prosecutor sneered at ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB is already dead ,  ProtagonistC said .  And even if ProtagonistB was still alive , there is no way to prove that ProtagonistA are not in league with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA are just as guilty as ProtagonistB was . ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head .  No , ProtagonistA am not ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA swear , on ProtagonistA's honor , that ProtagonistA am innocent . The crowd was getting restless , and the king signaled for ProtagonistA to be taken away . ProtagonistA went quietly , ProtagonistA's head held high . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had done nothing wrong , and ProtagonistA was determined to prove ProtagonistA's innocence . 
.
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and watched from behind the large , open window of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been following the herd of wild horses for days , and they had finally led ProtagonistA to their hidden valley . Now ProtagonistA just had to wait for the right moment to make ProtagonistA's move . ProtagonistA watched as the herd grazed and played , their bodies shining in the sunlight . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would have to be careful , as these horses were wild and unpredictable . But ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA could not let this opportunity pass ProtagonistA by . Finally , when the herd was resting in the shade of a grove of trees , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's move . ProtagonistA quietly approached ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA slowly reached out ProtagonistA's hand to touch ProtagonistB's soft nose , and ProtagonistB did not shy away . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's new home . 
.
ProtagonistA had seen the white sapland before , but ProtagonistA had n't known what it was , or why people did what they did . ProtagonistA had always thought it was just a place where people went to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city . But one day , ProtagonistA found out the truth . ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the sapland was a place of peace and healing , and that people came there to find themselves . ProtagonistA was amazed by what ProtagonistA heard , and ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been missing out on something special . From then on , ProtagonistA made it a point to visit the sapland every chance ProtagonistA got , and ProtagonistA even started to bring friends and family with ProtagonistA . The sapland became a part of ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA was grateful to have found it . 
.
It was dinner time for a couple of hours when the doorbell rang , and ProtagonistA came to the door to discover that ProtagonistB had just drowned . ProtagonistA was so distraught that ProtagonistA did n't even notice the man standing there with a camera until ProtagonistB was gone . 
.
ProtagonistA rode into the door of the guild hall and pulled her whip out of ProtagonistA's saddlebag .  ProtagonistA 'm here to join the guild ,  ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistB looked ProtagonistA up and down .  ProtagonistA do n't look like a adventurer ,  ProtagonistB said .  What 's ProtagonistA's class ?   ProtagonistA 'm a whip user ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 've been adventuring for years .  ProtagonistB looked impressed .  Very well ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA can fill out this form and we 'll get ProtagonistA started .  ProtagonistA filled out the form and joined the guild . 
.
ProtagonistA was sitting on the couch in the living room of a house in the middle of nowhere , drinking a glass of water which ProtagonistA hoped would last through the night . ProtagonistA was tired , but ProtagonistA could n't sleep . ProtagonistA had been on the run for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to feel safe . ProtagonistA had found this house a few days ago , and it had seemed like the perfect place to hide . But now , in the middle of the night , ProtagonistA was starting to feel like it was a trap . ProtagonistA was getting paranoid , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to sleep , but ProtagonistA just could n't . ProtagonistA heard a noise outside , and ProtagonistA tensed up . ProtagonistA was about to get up to investigate when ProtagonistA heard a voice .  ProtagonistA , it 's ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA relaxed when ProtagonistA recognized the voice of ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB were dead ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA were dead , too ,  ProtagonistB said .  But ProtagonistB 'm not . ProtagonistB 'm here , and ProtagonistB 'm going to help ProtagonistA .  
.
The first time ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB , when ProtagonistA had been a boy called Spike , ProtagonistA had been playing in the park with ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistB had been there with ProtagonistB's own friends , and they had all been playing together . ProtagonistA had thought that ProtagonistB was really cool , and ProtagonistA had been excited to talk to ProtagonistB . They had become friends after that , and they had stayed in touch even after they had both moved away . 
.
ProtagonistA stood in the shadow of ProtagonistB's dusty glass cabinet , ProtagonistA's hooves hanging down on the peg to keep the right eye steady . ProtagonistA had been in the same position for hours , waiting for ProtagonistB to come home from work . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would be tired and would n't want to talk , but ProtagonistA had to tell ProtagonistB what had happened . ProtagonistC had been killed in a hunting accident . ProtagonistC had been out with ProtagonistC's friends , trying to get a deer for the family . But ProtagonistC had slipped and fallen , and the deer had gored ProtagonistC with its antlers . ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistC when ProtagonistA went out to look for ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB came home and saw ProtagonistA standing there . ProtagonistB knew what had happened and ProtagonistB collapsed to the ground , weeping . ProtagonistA stood there , not knowing what to do , until ProtagonistB finally got up and hugged ProtagonistA . 
.
ProtagonistA was on the pedestal of ProtagonistB's bed , drooping down and frowning as ProtagonistA stared up at the stars . ProtagonistA was bored out of ProtagonistA's mind , and the only thing that was keeping ProtagonistA from flying away was the hope that ProtagonistB would come back soon . ProtagonistB had been gone for hours , and ProtagonistA was starting to get worried . Suddenly , the door opened and ProtagonistB walked in . ProtagonistA perked up immediately , and flew over to ProtagonistB .  Where have ProtagonistB been ?  ProtagonistA demanded .  ProtagonistA was starting to think ProtagonistB forgot about ProtagonistB laughed and ruffled ProtagonistA's mane .  ProtagonistB could never forget about ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB was just out for a walk . The stars are beautiful tonight , are n't they?Rainbow Dash followed ProtagonistB's gaze up to the sky . ProtagonistA had to admit , the stars were pretty .  Yeah , they are ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA guess ProtagonistA should n't have been so worried . Of course not ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'll always come back for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 're ProtagonistB's best friend .  
.
When ProtagonistA was twelve years old , ProtagonistA cowered inside a tight , heavy cage . ProtagonistA was scared and alone , and ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA had gotten there . The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was playing with ProtagonistA's friends in the park . Now ProtagonistA was in this dark , cold place , and ProtagonistA had no idea what was going to happen to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA heard footsteps approach , and then the cage was opened . ProtagonistB looked down at ProtagonistA . Welcome to ProtagonistA's new home , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA 're going to be here for a long time . ProtagonistA tried to scream , but no sound would come out . ProtagonistA was too terrified to move as ProtagonistB reached in and grabbed ProtagonistA by the arm , dragging ProtagonistA out of the cage . ProtagonistA was taken to a small room and chained to the wall . ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA there , laughing as ProtagonistB went . ProtagonistA could only sit there and cry , wondering what was going to happen to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA was going to die in this place , and ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistA's family or friends again . 
.
ProtagonistA was standing there in the shade of the window of ProtagonistB's office , watching ProtagonistB's ProtagonistB's house burn down . It was a tragic sight , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a sense of relief . ProtagonistB had been a abusive woman , and ProtagonistA had always dreaded going home to ProtagonistB . Now , with ProtagonistB's house gone , ProtagonistA would never have to go back there again . ProtagonistA could start fresh , and finally be free . 
.
It was the day ProtagonistB , died , yet ProtagonistA was feeling very much alive . It was as if the world had been turned upside down and ProtagonistA was the only one left standing . ProtagonistA did n't know how to feel or what to do . ProtagonistA just knew that ProtagonistA had to keep going . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream as ProtagonistA walked through the streets . ProtagonistA saw people going about their lives , completely unaware of the tragedy that had just occurred . ProtagonistA wanted to scream at them , to tell them that they should be grieving with ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA could n't find the words . ProtagonistA eventually made ProtagonistA's way to the park , where ProtagonistA sat down on a bench and just stared at the sky . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB up there , smiling down at ProtagonistA . That gave ProtagonistA some comfort and ProtagonistA was finally able to start processing what had happened . It was going to be a long road ahead , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could get through it with the help of ProtagonistA's loved ones . And ProtagonistA would always cherish the memories of ProtagonistB .

ProtagonistA burst through the door to ProtagonistB's room , screaming ,  What 's happened ?  ProtagonistB was sitting on ProtagonistB's bed , looking pale and shaken .  ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB was in the bathroom , and ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistC in the mirror .  ProtagonistA did n't know what to say . ProtagonistA had always thought ProtagonistB was a little bit crazy , but this was too much .  Come on , ProtagonistB , there 's no such thing as ghosts .   ProtagonistB know that ,  ProtagonistB said .  But ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was a woman , and ProtagonistC was wearing a white dress . ProtagonistC had long hair , and ProtagonistC was floating in the air .  ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head .  ProtagonistB 're just seeing things , ProtagonistB . There 's nothing there .  But ProtagonistB was adamant .  ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB 'm telling ProtagonistA . ProtagonistC was right there in the mirror .  ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA did n't believe in ghosts , but ProtagonistB was clearly terrified . ProtagonistA decided to call their parents and tell them what was going on . Maybe they could help ProtagonistB deal with whatever was going on . 
.
ProtagonistB sat on the bank , and stretched out ProtagonistA's hooves before ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB 'm going to have to give ProtagonistA a trim soon ,  ProtagonistB said , running ProtagonistB's fingers through the long , tangled hair .  But first , let 's get ProtagonistA cleaned up . ProtagonistA stood patiently as ProtagonistB used a bucket of water to wash away the dirt and mud from ProtagonistA's hooves . ProtagonistB was gentle but firm , scrubbing away at the grime until ProtagonistA's hooves were clean and shining . There ProtagonistA go ,  ProtagonistB said , putting the bucket down .  All clean . ProtagonistA nickered softly , thank ProtagonistB for taking care of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB smiled and patted ProtagonistA's neck .  No problem , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB 'm always here to help .  
.
The first time I saw ProtagonistA drape the tray table of ProtagonistA's crib across the kitchen window , it was ProtagonistB , looking through the window and murmuring ,  Oh , there 's a boy .  I was so startled that I almost dropped my tray of food . It was clear that ProtagonistB had never seen a baby before , let alone one in a crib . I quickly set the tray down and went to the window to see what ProtagonistB was looking at . ProtagonistA was fast asleep , ProtagonistA's little chest rising and falling with each breath . I could n't help but smile at the sight . ProtagonistB was still murmuring to ProtagonistB ,  Oh , there 's a boy ,  as I walked away . It was clear that ProtagonistB was enamored with ProtagonistA , and I knew that ProtagonistB would be a good friend to ProtagonistA . 
.
ProtagonistA fell for the first time in ProtagonistA's life when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was everything ProtagonistA had ever wanted in a man ; ProtagonistB was handsome , funny , and smart . ProtagonistA fell hard for ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA thought that maybe , just maybe , ProtagonistB felt the same way about ProtagonistA . But it quickly became apparent that ProtagonistB was only interested in ProtagonistA as a friend . ProtagonistB would never make a move , no matter how much ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistB to . ProtagonistA tried everything ProtagonistA could think of to make ProtagonistB see ProtagonistA as more than just a friend , but it was all for nothing . Eventually , ProtagonistA had to accept that ProtagonistB would never return ProtagonistA's feelings . It was a hard pill to swallow , but ProtagonistA was a stronger man for it . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could find someone who would love ProtagonistA back just as much as ProtagonistA loved them . 
.
Me too , ProtagonistB , gushed ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's eyes sparkling as ProtagonistA turned the thick chain of grass around ProtagonistA to the side . ProtagonistA never thought ProtagonistA 'd find another one like ProtagonistB , but here ProtagonistB is ! Can you believe it ? 
.
ProtagonistA was a simple man . ProtagonistA worked hard all ProtagonistA's life , first as a farmhand and then as a blacksmith . ProtagonistA never married and had no children , but ProtagonistA was content . ProtagonistA was a good man , and everyone in the village knew it . One day , ProtagonistB came to the village . ProtagonistB was beautiful and kind , and ProtagonistB spoke to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB wanted ProtagonistA to be ProtagonistB's king . ProtagonistA was shocked , but ProtagonistA could n't refuse . ProtagonistA was crowned king , and ProtagonistA ruled for many years . ProtagonistA was a good king , and the people loved ProtagonistA . But one day , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was getting old . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could n't rule forever , and ProtagonistA wanted to make sure that the people would be taken care of after ProtagonistA was gone . So ProtagonistA decreed that , from that day forward , any mare in a free state would have the right to vote and to be elected . It was a radical idea , but ProtagonistA knew that it was the right thing to do . ProtagonistA wanted to make sure that everyone had a say in their own future . 
.
ProtagonistA dreamed that ProtagonistA was walking through a dense forest . The trees were so tall that they blocked out the sky . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance . It sounded like someone was crying . ProtagonistA followed the noise until ProtagonistA came to a clearing . In the clearing was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was sitting on the ground , crying . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB was lost . ProtagonistB had been walking in the forest for days and could n't find ProtagonistB's way out . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB not to worry , ProtagonistA would help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's way out of the Forest . Together , they started walking . After a while , they came to the edge of the forest . ProtagonistB was so happy to be out of the Forest . ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help and went on ProtagonistB's way . 
.
ProtagonistB always told ProtagonistA that the sky was the limit . No matter what ProtagonistA wanted to do in life , ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistA could achieve it if ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to it . And so , from a young age , ProtagonistA began looking up at the sky and dreaming of all the things ProtagonistA could do . As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA continued to look up at the sky , but ProtagonistA also began to notice all the things that were happening on the ground around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA saw the struggles of ProtagonistA's friends and neighbors and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA wanted to help them . So , ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's sights on becoming a doctor . ProtagonistA studied hard and worked even harder , and eventually ProtagonistA achieved ProtagonistA's goal . And , throughout ProtagonistA's career , ProtagonistA never forgot what ProtagonistB had told ProtagonistA : that the sky was the limit .

ProtagonistA had not been married for many years , and ProtagonistB was now grown and married ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistA's own wife , who had died when ProtagonistB was only a child . ProtagonistA had never remarried , and had instead devoted ProtagonistA to raising ProtagonistB . Now that ProtagonistB was married , ProtagonistA felt somewhat lost . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could not continue to live alone , and so ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA would go back to the family home and marry a woman . 
.
The day the earth froze , ProtagonistA used the last of ProtagonistA's magic power to reveal to ProtagonistB the greatest secret of all .  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB 've always wondered why ProtagonistA 'm so different from ProtagonistB . The truth is , ProtagonistA 'm not entirely human . ProtagonistA 'm actually a magical being from another world . ProtagonistA was sent here to help make ProtagonistB's life better , and ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA 've done a pretty good job . But now , ProtagonistA's magic is gone and ProtagonistA have to go back to ProtagonistA's own world . ProtagonistA 'm sorry ProtagonistA could n't tell ProtagonistB sooner , but ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB 'll be just fine without ProtagonistA .  With that , ProtagonistA vanished into thin air , leaving ProtagonistB to wonder what had just happened . 
.
 That recipe 's on ProtagonistC ,  said ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB , sitting down in a seat at the end of the court .  ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB to get it for ProtagonistA . What recipe ?  ProtagonistB asked . The one for the perfect crime ,  ProtagonistA replied .  ProtagonistA need to get ProtagonistA's hands on it so ProtagonistA can finally get away with murder . ProtagonistB was taken aback by the request .  ProtagonistB 'm not sure ProtagonistB can do that ,  ProtagonistB said . You have to ,  ProtagonistA insisted .  ProtagonistA 'm going to kill ProtagonistA's wife and ProtagonistA need to make sure ProtagonistA do n't get caught . The recipe is on ProtagonistC's computer and ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB to hack into it and get it for ProtagonistA . The lawyer was hesitant , but ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB could n't just let ProtagonistA commit murder . ProtagonistB agreed to try and get the recipe for the perfect crime . A few days later , ProtagonistB was able to hack into ProtagonistC's computer and get the recipe . ProtagonistB gave it to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was never caught and the recipe was never found . 
.
ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistA's eyes peeled for anything out of the ordinary , but ProtagonistA was doing ProtagonistA best to ignore the odd look the look of interest was giving ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA let ProtagonistA get too caught up in what was going on , ProtagonistA would never be able to focus on ProtagonistA's work . It was important to ProtagonistA to stay focused , no matter what . But the more ProtagonistA tried to ignore the look , the more it seemed to bother ProtagonistA . It was as if the look was boring into ProtagonistA's soul , demanding ProtagonistA's attention . ProtagonistA tried to shake it off , but it was no use . Finally , ProtagonistA gave up and turned to ProtagonistB . Can ProtagonistA help ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked , a little bit of annoyance in ProtagonistA's voice . ProtagonistB , smiled .  ProtagonistB 'm sorry , ProtagonistB did n't mean to stare . It 's just that ProtagonistA look so much like ProtagonistB's brother . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart soften a little .  Oh , ProtagonistA see . ProtagonistA 'm sorry to hear about ProtagonistB's brother . Thank ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  It 's been hard , but ProtagonistB 'm trying to stay positive . With that , ProtagonistB turned and walked away , leaving ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's thoughts . ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistB's story and ProtagonistB's strength in the face of adversity . It reminded ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA , too , had to be strong . No matter what life threw at ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA would keep ProtagonistA's eyes peeled for anything out of the ordinary and stay focused on what was important . 
.
ProtagonistA had always been an early riser , so it was no surprise to find ProtagonistA up and about at the crack of dawn . However , what was surprising was that ProtagonistA was now standing in the middle of ProtagonistB's bookstore . ProtagonistA looked around the vast space with the air of a man who had been transported back to England . It was clear that ProtagonistA was not used to the sight of so many books . In fact , it appeared as if ProtagonistA had never seen a bookstore before . ProtagonistB , approached ProtagonistA with a quizzical look on ProtagonistB's face .  Can ProtagonistB help ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked . ProtagonistA turned to ProtagonistB and said ,  ProtagonistA 'm looking for a book on etiquette . ProtagonistA 've been told that ProtagonistA need to improve ProtagonistA's manners . ProtagonistB smiled and led ProtagonistA to the section on etiquette . ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA find a few books on the subject and then left ProtagonistA to browse . ProtagonistA was so engrossed in the books that ProtagonistA did n't notice when the store started to fill up with customers . As the day went on , ProtagonistA became more and more comfortable in the bookstore . ProtagonistA started chatting with the customers and helping them find the books they were looking for . By the end of the day , ProtagonistA had made quite a few friends . It was only when ProtagonistA was getting ready to leave that ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had completely forgotten about ProtagonistA's original mission . ProtagonistA had found what ProtagonistA was looking for , not in a book , but in the people ProtagonistA had met . 
.
ProtagonistA had been married to Applejack for several weeks when ProtagonistA heard that Twilight was expecting ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was overjoyed for ProtagonistA's friends and could n't wait to meet ProtagonistB . When ProtagonistB was born , ProtagonistA was one of the first to visit and held ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's arms , tears of joy streaming down ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA was so happy to have another little one in the family and could n't wait to watch ProtagonistB grow up . 
.
ProtagonistA was out on a walk with ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA suddenly had the urge to play a prank on ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA quickly slit the muzzle of ProtagonistB's gun into the air and let out a little whine of  Oops !  around the top of ProtagonistA's throat . ProtagonistB was so startled by the sudden noise that ProtagonistB dropped ProtagonistB's gun and ran off in terror . ProtagonistA laughed to ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB go , before continuing on ProtagonistA's walk . 
.
ProtagonistA was so nervous , ProtagonistA could barely stand still . ProtagonistA had never been away from home before , and the big city was so scary . But ProtagonistB had promised ProtagonistA that everything would be alright . It 's all right , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said so sweetly , that ProtagonistB's hooves shook the paper as ProtagonistB said it .  ProtagonistB said so , and ProtagonistB 's never lied to ProtagonistA before , has he?The filly shook ProtagonistA's head , and ProtagonistB nuzzled ProtagonistA gently . Then trust ProtagonistB , everything will be just fine . And with that , ProtagonistA found the courage to step out into the unknown . 
.
One morning ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's doubts again . ProtagonistA was walking to work , and ProtagonistA just could n't shake the feeling that something was off . ProtagonistA could n't put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but ProtagonistA just had this feeling like something bad was going to happen . ProtagonistA tried to push it out of ProtagonistA's mind , but it was just nagging at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistB calling ProtagonistA's name until ProtagonistA was right in front of ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA okay ? ProtagonistA looked a million miles away .  ProtagonistA snapped out of it and forced a smile .  Yeah , ProtagonistA 'm fine . Just got a lot on ProtagonistA's mind .  ProtagonistB nodded understandingly .  Well , try to leave it at the door . We 've got a lot to do today .  ProtagonistA nodded and went to ProtagonistA's desk . ProtagonistA tried to focus on ProtagonistA's work , but ProtagonistA's mind was still racing . ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistB calling ProtagonistA's name until ProtagonistB was right in front of ProtagonistB .

ProtagonistA nodded and went to ProtagonistA's desk . ProtagonistA tried to focus on ProtagonistA's work , but ProtagonistA's mind was still racing . 
.
ProtagonistA was back at the bank , shuffling ProtagonistA's feet as ProtagonistA waited with bated breath for the check to come in . ProtagonistA had been waiting for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had been laid off from ProtagonistA's job . The check was ProtagonistA's last hope ; if it did n't come in , ProtagonistA would be homeless . Finally , the check arrived . ProtagonistA's heart sank as ProtagonistA saw the amount ; it was far less than ProtagonistA had been expecting . There was no way it would be enough to cover ProtagonistA's rent . ProtagonistA was desperate . ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB and begged for a loan , but ProtagonistB refused . ProtagonistA had no collateral and no way to prove ProtagonistA could repay the loan . ProtagonistA was out of options . ProtagonistA went home and packed ProtagonistA's belongings into a suitcase . ProtagonistA would have to find a way to make the check stretch until ProtagonistA could find another job . 
.
ProtagonistA looked around , minding ProtagonistA's own business , when ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA face to face with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was looking for a fight , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was n't going to back down . They stared each other down for what felt like an eternity , until finally ProtagonistB made ProtagonistB's move . ProtagonistB charged straight for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was ready . ProtagonistA dodged to the side at the last second , leaving ProtagonistB to slam into a tree . ProtagonistB was momentarily stunned , and ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's opportunity . ProtagonistA ran up to ProtagonistB and punched ProtagonistB in the face as hard as ProtagonistA could . ProtagonistB went down , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had won . 
.
ProtagonistA lifted ProtagonistA's head , and peered out over the horizon . ProtagonistA had been walking for days , and was getting tired . ProtagonistA had been hoping to find a town soon , but so far ProtagonistA had seen nothing but desert . ProtagonistA was about to give up and sit down for a rest , when ProtagonistA saw something in the distance . ProtagonistA started walking towards it , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was a town . ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , and soon ProtagonistA was in the town . ProtagonistA went to the first building ProtagonistA saw , and knocked on the door . ProtagonistB answered , and when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB screamed . 
.
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's bedroom , writing a letter to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was telling ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's day and how ProtagonistA had made a new friend . ProtagonistA was really happy and ProtagonistA wanted to share it with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was also telling ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's plans for the future and how ProtagonistA wanted to make a difference in the world . ProtagonistA was really excited about life and ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistB to know it . 
.
ProtagonistA had been meaning to write to ProtagonistB for a long time , but ProtagonistA was beginning to get tired of waiting . Finally , ProtagonistA decided to take matters into ProtagonistA's own hands and write ProtagonistB a letter . In it , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB how ProtagonistA felt about ProtagonistB and how much ProtagonistA cared for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA also told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was getting tired of waiting for ProtagonistB to make a move and that ProtagonistA was going to take action . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB to meet ProtagonistA at the park the following day so that they could talk . The next day , ProtagonistA waited at the park for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB never showed up . ProtagonistA was heartbroken and decided that it was time to move on . 
.
ProtagonistA had always been a bridesmaid ; ProtagonistB had promised a wedding for ProtagonistA and had lived up to that . But when the day came , ProtagonistA was left at the altar by ProtagonistA's fiancée . It was a crushing blow to ProtagonistA's ego and ProtagonistA's heart . ProtagonistB was sympathetic , but ProtagonistB was also a realist . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that it was time to move on and find someone else . ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's advice and started dating again . ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC and they hit it off immediately . ProtagonistC was everything that ProtagonistA had ever wanted in a wife and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA wanted to spend the rest of ProtagonistA's life with ProtagonistC . They were married a year later and ProtagonistA was finally happy . 
.
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked down at a firm blank horizon . ProtagonistA had been walking for days , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and ProtagonistA's stomach was empty . ProtagonistA had been hoping to find a town or a farm , but so far ProtagonistA had seen nothing but empty fields . ProtagonistA was about to give up and lie down to die when ProtagonistA saw a faint light in the distance . ProtagonistA got up and started walking towards it , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was a lamp in a window . ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , and soon ProtagonistA was at the door of the farmhouse . ProtagonistA knocked , and ProtagonistB answered . ProtagonistB was old and wrinkled , but ProtagonistB had a kind face . ProtagonistB invited ProtagonistA in and fed ProtagonistA a warm meal . ProtagonistA went to bed that night feeling hopeful for the first time in a long time . 
.
ProtagonistA had been sneaking into the Ponyville library for weeks now . ProtagonistA was always careful to do it when the library was crowded , so that no one would notice ProtagonistA . But one morning , ProtagonistA was caught red - handed by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked . I'm sorry , ProtagonistA just really wanted to read this book ,  ProtagonistA said . You know you 're not allowed to take books without permission . ProtagonistA 're going to have to leave now . ProtagonistA hung ProtagonistA's head in shame and walked out of the library . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had been caught this time , but ProtagonistA was determined to find a way to get ProtagonistA's hands on that book . 
.
ProtagonistA hope we 'll be okay ... at least . said ProtagonistA , resting ProtagonistA's hoof on the end of ProtagonistB's hoof . They had been walking for hours , ever since they had seen the fire in the distance . Now , there was no sign of the fire , or any other living creature . The only sound was the crunching of their hooves on the dry , dead grass . I'm sure we 'll be fine ,  said ProtagonistB , although ProtagonistB did n't sound very sure . ProtagonistA nodded , but said nothing . ProtagonistA was tired , and ProtagonistA's hooves hurt . ProtagonistA just wanted to find a place to rest , and maybe some food . Suddenly , ProtagonistB stopped .  What is it ?  asked ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB heard something ,  ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistB's ears perked up . ProtagonistA listened , but ProtagonistA could n't hear anything .  ProtagonistA do n't hear anything ,  ProtagonistA said . Shh !  said ProtagonistB .  There it is again!This time , ProtagonistA could hear it too . It sounded like ... laughter . Who 's there ?  called ProtagonistB . The laughter stopped , and there was silence . Come out , we wo n't hurt you !  called ProtagonistB . Still , there was no response . Maybe we should go ,  said ProtagonistA . But before they could move , they heard the laughter again , this time closer . And then , they saw them . Three creatures , with long , sharp teeth and bright red eyes . Run !  yelled ProtagonistB . And they did . They ran as fast as they could , the creatures hot on their heels . But ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were faster . They made it to the safety of the forest and collapsed , exhausted , on the ground . That was close ,  said ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB's heart racing . Too close ,  said ProtagonistA .  But at least we 're safe now .  
.
ProtagonistA was a horse whisperer . ProtagonistA could communicate with horses better than anyone else . When ProtagonistA sat down on ProtagonistA's hind legs and bridled the fierce thirst of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB calmed down and listened to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's life and how ProtagonistA 'd been kicked out of the herd by the alpha male . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about how ProtagonistA 'd been wandering the plains alone for months , searching for a new herd to join . ProtagonistB listened intently and when ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to follow ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA to a herd of wild mustangs and introduced ProtagonistA to the alpha male . ProtagonistA was welcomed into the herd and ProtagonistA finally had a place to call home . 
.
ProtagonistA had been living in the fort for a few months now and had grown to love the peace and quiet it provided . ProtagonistA was always the first to wake up in the morning and would spend ProtagonistA's time exploring the grounds or reading in the library . The other residents of the fort were friendly , but ProtagonistA never felt like ProtagonistA really fit in . Tonight , ProtagonistA had decided to have dinner in ProtagonistA's own house on the fort grounds . ProtagonistA had been given the house by the fort 's owner and had furnished it with everything ProtagonistA needed . ProtagonistA sat down at the large , white - walled low table and began to eat ProtagonistA's dinner . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the other room . ProtagonistA got up to investigate and found ProtagonistB trying to break into ProtagonistA's house . ProtagonistA ran back to the dining room and grabbed a knife from the table . ProtagonistA ran back to ProtagonistB and stabbed ProtagonistB in the stomach . ProtagonistB collapsed to the ground and ProtagonistA ran back to the dining room , where ProtagonistA called the fort 's security . ProtagonistB was taken away and ProtagonistA was left alone in ProtagonistA's house . ProtagonistA finished ProtagonistA's dinner , but ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that something was watching ProtagonistA . 
.
There was once , in the sparsely - settled setting of the stone town of Golden ProtagonistA sat , ProtagonistA's eyes closed and listening to the sounds of the surrounding woods . ProtagonistA was a peaceful man , and ProtagonistA found solace in the quiet of the forest . It was a place that ProtagonistA had always felt connected to , ever since ProtagonistA was a young boy . ProtagonistA had many fond memories of exploring the woods with ProtagonistA's friends , and ProtagonistA still loved to take a walk through them whenever ProtagonistA had the chance . Today , however , something was different . ProtagonistA could feel a presence in the forest that ProtagonistA had never felt before . It was a strange feeling , and one that ProtagonistA could n't quite explain . But it was also a feeling that ProtagonistA could n't ignore . Slowly , ProtagonistA stood up and began to follow the feeling , not knowing what ProtagonistA would find . As ProtagonistA walked , the feeling grew stronger and stronger , until ProtagonistA came to a clearing in the woods . And there , in the clearing , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was standing with ProtagonistB back to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB did n't seem to be aware of ProtagonistA's presence . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to speak to ProtagonistB . Slowly , ProtagonistA walked forward , and when ProtagonistA was just a few feet away from ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA cleared ProtagonistA's throat to get ProtagonistB's attention . When ProtagonistB turned around , ProtagonistA was shocked to see that ProtagonistB had the most beautiful eyes ProtagonistA had ever seen . They were a deep blue , and they seemed to look right into ProtagonistA's soul . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could get lost in them forever . ProtagonistB did n't say anything , but ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA . And in that moment , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had found the love of ProtagonistA's life . 
.
ProtagonistA was sitting at the kitchen table , working on ProtagonistA's homework . ProtagonistB was busy at the stove , cooking dinner . Twilight Sparkle peered over ProtagonistA's shoulder at ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a kind woman , always busy taking care of ProtagonistB's family . Twilight Sparkle could n't help but admire ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistA was brushing ProtagonistB's hair as the sun rose over the sky . ProtagonistA had been up since before dawn , and ProtagonistA was feeling the effects of a long day . ProtagonistB , however , was fresh and full of energy . ProtagonistB nickered softly as ProtagonistA brushed ProtagonistB's coat , and ProtagonistA could n't help but smile . ProtagonistA had been working on the farm since ProtagonistA was a young boy , and ProtagonistA loved every minute of it . There was something about being out in the open air that just made ProtagonistA feel alive . And ProtagonistB was one of ProtagonistA's favorite parts of the farm . ProtagonistA had raised ProtagonistB from a foal , and ProtagonistB was like a member of the family . ProtagonistA finished brushing ProtagonistB's coat and gave ProtagonistB a pat on the neck .  There ProtagonistB go , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistB 're all set for the day . The mare nickered again and ProtagonistA turned to head back to the house . ProtagonistA had a lot of work to do today , but ProtagonistA would n't trade it for anything in the world . 
.
ProtagonistA had been a force in the history of the land for many years . ProtagonistA had passed away a few years before , but ProtagonistB had not forgotten ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB remembered all of the good times they had together and how ProtagonistA had always been there for ProtagonistB . Even though ProtagonistA was gone , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA would always be with ProtagonistA in spirit . 
.
ProtagonistA had always been a patient man . ProtagonistA would sit for hours waiting for the perfect moment to strike . ProtagonistB had always admired that about ProtagonistA . When ProtagonistB was younger , ProtagonistB would often find ProtagonistA sitting in the same spot , waiting for the perfect fish to swim by . ProtagonistA never got frustrated , or angry . ProtagonistA would just sit there patiently , waiting . ProtagonistB had been sitting on the dock for hours , waiting for a bite . ProtagonistA had always told ProtagonistB that patience was key when fishing . ProtagonistB was determined to catch a fish today . ProtagonistB had been out there since early morning , and it was now evening . The sun was beginning to set , and the moon was leveling off . ProtagonistA had always said that the best time to fish was at night , under the light of the moon . ProtagonistB was getting tired , and was about to give up for the night , when ProtagonistB felt a tug on ProtagonistB's line . ProtagonistB reeled in the line , and sure enough , ProtagonistB had caught a fish . ProtagonistB was so excited , ProtagonistB forgot all about ProtagonistB's tiredness . ProtagonistB shouted for ProtagonistA to come over . ProtagonistA came over , and was so proud of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had finally caught a fish . 
.
ProtagonistA gave a hoof and ProtagonistA's ears a slight twitching . It was time to go . ProtagonistA had been waiting for this moment for years . ProtagonistA was a horse , and ProtagonistA was about to embark on the greatest adventure of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistB , had been planning this trip for months , and now it was finally time to go . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was excited , but ProtagonistA was also a little bit nervous . After all , they were going to be riding across the country on horseback . But ProtagonistA was up for the challenge . ProtagonistA had been trained for this trip , and ProtagonistA was ready to go . ProtagonistB saddled ProtagonistA up and they set off . The first few days were easy enough , but as they got further into their journey , the terrain became more difficult . ProtagonistA was happy to have ProtagonistB by ProtagonistA's side , and ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to help ProtagonistB navigate the difficult terrain . They rode for hours each day , and ProtagonistA never once complained . ProtagonistA was determined to make it to the end of the journey . And finally , after weeks of riding , they arrived at their destination . ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA had made it across the country on horseback , and they were both exhausted . But they had accomplished something amazing , and they would never forget the adventure they had shared . 
.
I know this is a story about ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB , but even it ca n't be denied that it 's a story for the ages . It was a time when the world was a different place , and ProtagonistB was a different man . ProtagonistB was a man of ProtagonistB's word , and ProtagonistB did n't take kindly to people who did n't live up to their promises . That 's why , when ProtagonistB found out that ProtagonistD had left ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB was furious . ProtagonistB went to ProtagonistD's house and demanded that ProtagonistD marry ProtagonistC or ProtagonistB would kill ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD did n't take ProtagonistB seriously and laughed in ProtagonistB's face . That 's when ProtagonistB pulled out ProtagonistB's gun and shot ProtagonistD . ProtagonistB did n't think twice about it , and ProtagonistB did n't regret it either . After that , ProtagonistB went back to ProtagonistC and told ProtagonistC what ProtagonistB had done . ProtagonistC was shocked , but ProtagonistC did n't say anything . ProtagonistB was a changed man after that . ProtagonistB was more distant and ProtagonistB drank more . ProtagonistA tried to talk to ProtagonistB about it , but ProtagonistB would just brush ProtagonistA off . Eventually , ProtagonistA stopped trying . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would never be the same . 
.
ProtagonistA had been walking through the woods for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting tired . ProtagonistA had been following a trail , but it seemed to have disappeared . ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA was going in circles . ProtagonistA sat down to rest on a log , and ProtagonistA looked up at the moon . It was so bright , and it shone between the trees . But ProtagonistA's eyes told ProtagonistA otherwise . ProtagonistA was sure the moon was getting bigger and brighter . ProtagonistA got up and started to walk again , and ProtagonistA came to a clearing . In the middle of the clearing was a big rock , and on the rock was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was beautiful , and ProtagonistB was wearing a white dress . ProtagonistB's hair was long and flowing , and ProtagonistB had a crown of flowers on ProtagonistB's head . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was dreaming , but ProtagonistA did n't want to wake up . 
.
ProtagonistA was a Fox - man of the valley , and in those days , the Fox - men were at war with the evil forces of the world . They fought against both good and evil , and even in the darkest hours of the war , when their very survival depended on it , ProtagonistA kept a close watch on ProtagonistA's allies and ProtagonistA's sons . ProtagonistA was a brave and noble warrior , and ProtagonistA would do whatever it took to protect ProtagonistA's people . One day , while ProtagonistA was out on patrol , ProtagonistA spotted a group of enemy soldiers moving in on ProtagonistA's village . ProtagonistA quickly alerted ProtagonistA's fellow Fox - men , and they were able to defend the village and drive the enemy away . But not before ProtagonistA was seriously injured in the battle . ProtagonistA was taken to ProtagonistB . But ProtagonistA's injuries were too severe , and ProtagonistA died a few days later . ProtagonistA was a hero , and ProtagonistA will never be forgotten . ProtagonistA's bravery and selflessness in the face of evil inspired many others to follow in ProtagonistA's footsteps and fight for the freedom of the Fox - men . 
.
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider . ProtagonistA was conceived in the winter of ProtagonistA's year , seventeen months after ProtagonistA's father , Skylark of the Magic Gardens , and ProtagonistB , had met . This made ProtagonistA the odd one out in ProtagonistA's family , and ProtagonistA was always conscious of it . ProtagonistA tried to make the best of it , though , and rose through the ranks of the great Kingdom of Equestria from its tier - one position , into a far more stable , if very large , position . ProtagonistA made many friends along the way , but always felt like ProtagonistA was on the outside looking in . One day , ProtagonistA decided to confront ProtagonistA's feelings head on . ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's parents and asked them why ProtagonistA had been conceived so long after they had met . They looked at each other , and then ProtagonistB spoke . Your father and ProtagonistB were always meant to be together ,  ProtagonistB said .  But we did n't want to rush into things . We wanted to make sure that we were really ready for a family . So we waited , and ProtagonistA were the result of that wait . ProtagonistA were worth it , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 're our special little snowflake . ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistA's parents ' words , and finally felt like ProtagonistA belonged . ProtagonistA was their special little snowflake , and ProtagonistA was proud of it . 
.
ProtagonistA was exhausted . ProtagonistA had been searching through the hospital wing for hours , looking for the right book . ProtagonistA had been to the blue drawers a hundred times , but ProtagonistA just could n't find what ProtagonistA was looking for . ProtagonistA was about to give up and go to ProtagonistA's office when ProtagonistA heard a voice in the crowd . ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistA , over here!It was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was so relieved to see ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB , thank goodness . ProtagonistA 've been looking for ProtagonistB everywhere . What are ProtagonistA looking for , ProtagonistA book . The one with the blue cover . ProtagonistA need to find it before ProtagonistA's appointment . ProtagonistA , that book is in ProtagonistA's office . ProtagonistB saw it there earlier . ProtagonistA could n't believe it . ProtagonistA had been looking for hours and the book was in ProtagonistA's office the whole time . Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA do n't know what ProtagonistA would have done without ProtagonistB . Anytime , ProtagonistA . Now , let 's get ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's appointment .  
.
ProtagonistA turned at the last minute to see ProtagonistB sitting on the bank watching ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was about to go into the water to fish but ProtagonistB stopped ProtagonistA .  What are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked .  ProtagonistA 're going to get wet .   ProtagonistA know ,  ProtagonistA said .  But ProtagonistA really want to catch a fish .   ProtagonistA 're not going to catch any fish if ProtagonistA do n't have a bait ,  ProtagonistB said .  And ProtagonistA 're not going to have any bait if ProtagonistA do n't have a worm .   ProtagonistA know ,  ProtagonistA said .  But ProtagonistA really want to catch a fish .  ProtagonistB sighed and shook ProtagonistB's head .  Fine ,  ProtagonistB said .  But ProtagonistB 'm not going to help ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA smiled and went into the water . ProtagonistA did n't catch any fish but ProtagonistA had a lot of fun . 
.
ProtagonistA leaned against the tree , ProtagonistA's eyes closed and ProtagonistA's mouth hanging open . ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and was now exhausted . ProtagonistA was n't sure where ProtagonistA was , or where ProtagonistA was going . ProtagonistA just kept walking , until ProtagonistA could n't walk any further . ProtagonistA was thirsty , and hungry , but ProtagonistA did n't have the energy to search for food or water . ProtagonistA just wanted to rest . ProtagonistA was n't sure how long ProtagonistA had been leaning against the tree , but ProtagonistA must have dozed off , because the next thing ProtagonistA knew , someone was shaking ProtagonistA awake . ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes to see ProtagonistB standing in front of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was holding a canteen of water and a bag of food . ProtagonistB offered them to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA gratefully accepted . ProtagonistA drank the water and ate the food , and then asked ProtagonistB who ProtagonistB was . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's name was Sarah , and ProtagonistB had been out for a walk when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA ProtagonistA's name , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB it was ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA then asked ProtagonistB where ProtagonistA was , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA was in the forest . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for the food and water , and then asked ProtagonistB to show ProtagonistA the way out of the forest . ProtagonistB agreed , and they set off together . ProtagonistA was very grateful to ProtagonistB , and they became good friends . 
.
ProtagonistA stood there , still wearing ProtagonistA's royal blue dress . It was a little tight in the chest and the waist , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA loved how ProtagonistA looked in it . ProtagonistA felt like a princess . ProtagonistA twirled around , the skirt spinning out around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA laughed and then stopped when ProtagonistA saw the look on ProtagonistB's face . ProtagonistA , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked , ProtagonistB's voice tight . I'm twirling ,  ProtagonistA said , still spinning . You're a boy ,  ProtagonistB said .  Boys do n't wear dresses . I do n't care ,  ProtagonistA said , pouting .  ProtagonistA like this dress . Well , ProtagonistA ca n't wear it ,  ProtagonistB said .  It 's not appropriate . It 's just a dress ,  ProtagonistA said .  What 's the big deal?The big deal is that ProtagonistA 're a boy and boys do n't wear dresses ,  ProtagonistB said .  Now go upstairs and change into some clothes that are appropriate for a boy . ProtagonistA did n't want to change , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to . ProtagonistA slowly trudged up the stairs , the skirt of ProtagonistA's dress dragging behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA changed into a pair of jeans and a t - shirt and then went back downstairs . ProtagonistA did n't look at ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA walked past ProtagonistB and went outside to play . ProtagonistA was determined to find a way to wear that dress again . 
.
ProtagonistA was a horse , and a very good horse at that . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's way around the farm better than any other horse , and ProtagonistA was always the one that the other horses went to for advice . So when ProtagonistB came to the farm , ProtagonistA was the first to welcome ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB , said ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's hoof hovering over the apple cart .  It 's nice to meet ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA 'm sure ProtagonistB 'll like it here on the farm .  ProtagonistB was a bit hesitant at first , but ProtagonistB soon warmed up to ProtagonistA and the other horses on the farm . ProtagonistB loved the apple cart , and ProtagonistB would always beg ProtagonistA for an apple when ProtagonistA came by . One day , ProtagonistA came by the apple cart and ProtagonistB was n't there . ProtagonistA looked around for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB was nowhere to be found . ProtagonistA eventually found ProtagonistB in the pasture , grazing on some grass .  ProtagonistB , what are ProtagonistB doing out here ? You know ProtagonistB 're not supposed to be in the pasture .   ProtagonistB 'm sorry , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB just wanted to try something new .   Well , you ca n't just go off and try new things without letting someone know . ProtagonistB could have gotten lost .   ProtagonistB 'm sorry , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB wo n't do it again .   ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB wo n't , ProtagonistB . Just be careful from now on , okay ?   ProtagonistB will , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB promise .  
.
ProtagonistA sat down on the bench opposite ProtagonistC and looked around . It was a beautiful day , and the park was full of people enjoying the weather . ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB and a young couple playing frisbee . ProtagonistA smiled and turned to ProtagonistC .  Is n't it a great day ?  ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistC just stared at ProtagonistA and then got up and walked away . ProtagonistA was surprised , but shrugged it off and went back to people watching . 
.
It was a chilly , dark and stormy morning , and ProtagonistA was helping ProtagonistB , load ProtagonistB's car when the first hysterical hearers started peering through the panes of the neighboring windows . ProtagonistB had been diagnosed with a rare and incurable disease , and the doctors had told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB only had a few months to live . ProtagonistA was determined to make the most of the time they had left together , and so ProtagonistA had decided to take ProtagonistB on a road trip to see all the sights that ProtagonistB had always wanted to see . The first few days of the trip were great . They laughed , they talked , they made love . But as ProtagonistB's condition started to deteriorate , the fun turned to worry and then to fear . ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to keep ProtagonistB comfortable , but there was only so much ProtagonistA could do . And then , on the morning of the fifth day , ProtagonistB passed away peacefully in ProtagonistB's sleep . ProtagonistA was devastated , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to keep going . ProtagonistA had promised ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would see the trip through to the end . So , with a heavy heart , ProtagonistA loaded ProtagonistB's body into the car and continued on their journey . ProtagonistA stopped at all the places that ProtagonistB had wanted to see , and ProtagonistA took pictures and made notes so that ProtagonistA could share the experience with others . It was a difficult journey , but in the end , it was one that ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA made . It was a way to honor ProtagonistB and to keep ProtagonistB's memory alive . 
.
ProtagonistA has been seen seated on the floor , ProtagonistA's heels creaking slightly , the air of a confined space , and ProtagonistA sits quietly , a slight air of nervousness attached to ProtagonistA , as if ProtagonistA were about to lose ProtagonistA's temper . ProtagonistA looks around the room , taking in the other people seated in a circle around ProtagonistA . They all have similar expressions of nervousness and anxiety . ProtagonistA can feel the sweat beginning to form on ProtagonistA's forehead and ProtagonistA wipes it away with ProtagonistA's sleeve . ProtagonistA takes a deep breath and wills ProtagonistA to calm down . ProtagonistA does n't want to lose ProtagonistA's temper , not here , not now . ProtagonistA knows that if ProtagonistA does , ProtagonistA 'll only make things worse . The group is waiting for ProtagonistB to arrive and begin the meeting . ProtagonistA has been to these types of meetings before , but this one feels different . ProtagonistA ca n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but there is an air of tension in the room that was n't there before . Maybe it 's because they 're discussing such a sensitive topic , or maybe it 's because they 're all so on edge . Finally , ProtagonistB arrives and the meeting begins . ProtagonistA tries to pay attention , but ProtagonistA ca n't focus . ProtagonistA's mind keeps wandering back to the last meeting ProtagonistA was in , where things had gotten out of hand . ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's temper and said some things ProtagonistA regretted . ProtagonistA does n't want to make the same mistake again , but ProtagonistA can feel ProtagonistA's anger bubbling up inside of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA takes a few deep breaths and tries to focus on the discussion , but it 's hard . The meeting goes on for what feels like hours . ProtagonistA's mind is racing and ProtagonistA can feel ProtagonistA's temper slowly slipping . ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA needs to leave before ProtagonistA says something ProtagonistA 'll regret , but ProtagonistA does n't want to make a scene . ProtagonistA can feel everyone 's eyes on ProtagonistA , and the pressure is too much . Finally , ProtagonistA ca n't take it anymore and ProtagonistA explodes . ProtagonistA yells at ProtagonistB , telling ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB 's a fraud and that this whole meeting is a waste of time . ProtagonistA then storms out of the room , leaving the others behind . ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA should n't have lost ProtagonistA's temper like that , but ProtagonistA ca n't help it . ProtagonistA 's so angry and frustrated . ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA needs to calm down , but ProtagonistA ca n't . ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA 's about to explode . ProtagonistA goes for a walk , trying to clear ProtagonistA's head , but it does n't help . ProtagonistA 's still so angry and ProtagonistA does n't know what to do . 
.
ProtagonistA was having a great day . ProtagonistA was out in the park , enjoying the sunshine and the fresh air . And ProtagonistA had a bag of delicious cupcakes . ProtagonistA was just about to take a bite of one when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB watching ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was a girl , and ProtagonistB was smiling . ProtagonistA could n't help but smile back . ProtagonistB came over and sat down next to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as Twilight Sparkle . ProtagonistA was instantly drawn to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was so pretty and seemed so friendly . They began chatting and ProtagonistA soon found out that ProtagonistB was also a big fan of cupcakes . In fact , ProtagonistB was out of cupcakes . And ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA could share ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was more than happy to share ProtagonistA's cupcakes with ProtagonistB . And ProtagonistA could n't stop smiling . ProtagonistB was so girlish and pretty . It was confusing , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA was just happy to be spending time with ProtagonistB . 
.
The watch - thing , the one that was attached to the dress that ProtagonistA put on ProtagonistA's head , was ticking away in the dark . It was the only sound in the room , and it was starting to get on ProtagonistA's nerves . ProtagonistA had been in the room for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting tired of the darkness and the silence . ProtagonistA was starting to think that maybe ProtagonistA should just take the watch - thing off ProtagonistA's head and leave the room , when ProtagonistA heard a voice .  ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA still in there ?  The voice was faint and it sounded like it was coming from the other side of the door . ProtagonistA got up and went to the door , and ProtagonistA put ProtagonistA's ear to it .  Yes , ProtagonistA 'm still here ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm not sure how much longer ProtagonistA can stay in here .   Do n't worry , ProtagonistA ,  the voice said .  I 'm coming to get ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA heard the sound of footsteps getting closer , and then the door opened . A light came on , and ProtagonistA saw the face of ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA might need some company ,  ProtagonistB said .  Come on , let 's get out of here .  ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB left the room , and they did n't look back . 
.
ProtagonistA was at the dinner party waiting for ProtagonistB , to apologize for not coming sooner . ProtagonistB had promised ProtagonistA ProtagonistB would be there , but ProtagonistB was always busy with ProtagonistB's royal duties . ProtagonistA did n't mind , though . ProtagonistA was used to waiting for ProtagonistB . Finally , ProtagonistB arrived and they had a wonderful time catching up . ProtagonistB apologized for being late and promised to make it up to ProtagonistA . They laughed and talked all night , and ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had waited for ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistB was out of cupcakes . ProtagonistA was beginning to get quite worn out , though ProtagonistA had n't intended for ProtagonistA's obsession to get out of control . It had started innocently enough . A few cupcakes here and there . But then it had spiraled . ProtagonistB was always getting cupcakes , and ProtagonistA always wanted one . ProtagonistA began to follow ProtagonistB around , always begging for just one more . Finally , ProtagonistB had had enough . ProtagonistB confronted ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to get ProtagonistA's life together . ProtagonistA was heartbroken . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been taking advantage of ProtagonistB's kindness and that ProtagonistA needed to get help . With the help of ProtagonistA's friends , ProtagonistA was able to get ProtagonistA's cupcake obsession under control . ProtagonistA apologized to ProtagonistB and they were able to remain friends . 
.
ProtagonistA sat down on the edge of the bank , crossed ProtagonistA's legs , and stared out at the sea beyond the bank . ProtagonistA had always loved the ocean , ever since ProtagonistA was a little boy . Even now , as an old man , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel the same sense of wonder and awe that ProtagonistA had felt all those years ago . ProtagonistA watched as the waves crashed against the shore , the sun glinting off the water . ProtagonistA breathed in the salty air and felt the wind blowing through ProtagonistA's hair . It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was glad to be alive to see it . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB , standing a few feet away . ProtagonistB was smiling , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA for a while . It 's time to go , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA 'm ready when ProtagonistB are . ProtagonistA nodded and got to ProtagonistA's feet . ProtagonistA took one last look at the ocean , then turned and walked back to ProtagonistA's car with ProtagonistB . It was time to go home . 
.
ProtagonistA was born six months ago , and ProtagonistA was already sitting on a train headed for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA expected to find an elderly , dainty man sitting beside ProtagonistA , but instead ProtagonistA found a large , hairy man who was taking up most of the seat . The man was snoring loudly and drooling on the armrest . ProtagonistA was disgusted and tried to move to the other side of the train , but the man 's body was taking up so much space that ProtagonistA could n't squeeze past . ProtagonistA sat there for the rest of the ride , trying not to touch the man or breathe in his stench . ProtagonistA was relieved when the train finally arrived at the ProtagonistB station . ProtagonistA quickly got up and rushed off the train , glad to be away from the disgusting man . 
.
ProtagonistA , dressed in the highest style , sat down in the low dining - room of ProtagonistA's house on the bank of the Thames . ProtagonistA had just returned from a successful business trip to New York and was in a celebratory mood . ProtagonistA ordered the finest wine and the most expensive meal on the menu . As ProtagonistA waited for ProtagonistA's food , ProtagonistA looked out the window at the river flowing by . ProtagonistA was content and happy . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a loud splash . ProtagonistA got up to see what it was and saw ProtagonistB struggling in the water . Without thinking , ProtagonistA ran outside and jumped in . ProtagonistA was a strong swimmer and quickly reached ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA pulled ProtagonistB to safety and performed CPR until ProtagonistB revived . ProtagonistA was a hero . ProtagonistA had saved a life . And ProtagonistA was soaked . But ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA was just glad ProtagonistA was able to help . 
.
ProtagonistA sat down on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked down at the blank gray blue horizon . ProtagonistA had been walking for days , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and ProtagonistA's stomach was empty . ProtagonistA had been following a trail of bread crumbs , but they had long since been eaten by birds . ProtagonistA was n't sure where ProtagonistA was or where ProtagonistA was going . ProtagonistA only knew that ProtagonistA had to keep moving . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance . It sounded like someone was crying . ProtagonistA got up and started walking towards the sound . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB huddled on the ground . ProtagonistB was a little girl , and ProtagonistB was crying hysterically . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA did n't want to scare ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did n't want to leave ProtagonistB alone either . Finally , ProtagonistA decided to speak to ProtagonistB . Hello there ,  ProtagonistA said softly .  What 's wrong?The girl looked up at ProtagonistA with tear - stained cheeks .  ProtagonistB 'm lost ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 've been walking for days and ProtagonistB ca n't find ProtagonistB's way home . ProtagonistA's heart went out to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew how ProtagonistB felt . ProtagonistA had been in the same situation not too long ago . Don't worry ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'll help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's way home . ProtagonistA's name is ProtagonistA , by the way . ProtagonistB smiled through ProtagonistB's tears and introduced ProtagonistB . Then the two of them set off on the long journey home . 
.
ProtagonistA was a horse , and ProtagonistA was very proud of the fact that ProtagonistA had once saved the life of ProtagonistB . It had been a dark and stormy night , and ProtagonistB had been out riding when ProtagonistB's horse had been struck by lightning and killed . ProtagonistB had been thrown from the horse and was lying unconscious in the mud . ProtagonistA had seen what had happened and had galloped over to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had nudged ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's nose and whinnied loudly , until ProtagonistB had finally regained consciousness . ProtagonistB had been so grateful that ProtagonistB had made ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's personal horse and had given ProtagonistA a stable in the palace . Now , ProtagonistA was getting old , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would soon be retired . ProtagonistA was happy to have had such a long and eventful life , and ProtagonistA loved spending ProtagonistA's days in the stable , talking to the other horses about all the things ProtagonistA had seen and done . 
.
ProtagonistB was always telling ProtagonistA to hurry up .  Come on , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB would say .  We do n't have all day .  ProtagonistA hated it when ProtagonistB rushed ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistB would just let ProtagonistA take ProtagonistA's time . One day , ProtagonistA decided to take ProtagonistB's advice and hurry up . ProtagonistA rushed through ProtagonistA's breakfast and ran out the door . ProtagonistA did n't even say goodbye to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA just wanted to get to school and get it over with . But when ProtagonistA got to school , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's backpack at home . ProtagonistA had to go all the way back home to get it . ProtagonistA was so embarrassed . When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistB was waiting for ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to hurry up ,  ProtagonistB said .  Now ProtagonistA 're going to be late for school .  ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA had just listened to ProtagonistB in the first place . 
.
ProtagonistA was always a good listener . ProtagonistA never interrupted when ProtagonistB was talking , and ProtagonistA always had a kind word to say . That 's why ProtagonistB always felt comfortable confiding in ProtagonistA . So when ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's concerns about their relationship , ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistA would listen attentively and give ProtagonistB's wise counsel . It 's all right , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said comfortingly .  ProtagonistA 'm always here for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB can always come to ProtagonistA with whatever is on ProtagonistB's mind . ProtagonistB was relieved to hear ProtagonistA say that , and ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB could always count on ProtagonistA to be ProtagonistB's sounding board . Thankful for ProtagonistA's understanding , ProtagonistB hugged ProtagonistA tightly . 
.
ProtagonistA was perched on the edge of a high bank , snapping the last few pennies from ProtagonistA's neck when ProtagonistA heard the call of an emergency . ProtagonistA had been out of work for weeks and was down to ProtagonistA's last few dollars . ProtagonistA had been hoping to find a job today , but so far , no luck . ProtagonistA was about to give up and go home when ProtagonistA heard the call . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't ignore it . ProtagonistA had to help . ProtagonistA scrambled down the bank and ran towards the sound . ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB in the water , struggling to stay afloat . ProtagonistA did n't hesitate . ProtagonistA jumped in and pulled ProtagonistB to safety . ProtagonistA had just saved a life . 
.
ProtagonistA had taken to riding into ProtagonistA's house on ProtagonistA's pink saddle hoof , noting the rows of fifth - story windows that led from ProtagonistA's backyard down into the city . It was a short ride , but it always made ProtagonistA feel better to be up high , looking down at the hustle and bustle below . One day , as ProtagonistA was trotting along , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling to ProtagonistA from one of the windows . Bob ! ProtagonistA ! Come over here!It was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was always friendly , and ProtagonistA had always liked ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA steered his hoof over to ProtagonistB's window and stopped . Hello , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  What can ProtagonistA do for you?Oh , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB 'm so glad ProtagonistA 're here . ProtagonistB 've been watching ProtagonistA ride around on ProtagonistA's hoof , and ProtagonistB was wondering if ProtagonistA could help ProtagonistB with something . Of course ,  ProtagonistA said .  What do ProtagonistB need?Well ,  ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB 'm moving next week , and ProtagonistB was wondering if ProtagonistA could help ProtagonistB carry ProtagonistB's things down to the street . ProtagonistB ca n't do it all by ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB's son is too busy to help ProtagonistB . Of course ProtagonistA 'll help ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  Just tell ProtagonistA when ProtagonistB 're ready , and ProtagonistA 'll be there . A few days later , ProtagonistA was back at ProtagonistB's window , helping ProtagonistB to carry ProtagonistB's things down to the street . It was a lot of work , but ProtagonistA did n't mind . ProtagonistA was happy to help ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would appreciate it . When they were finished , ProtagonistB turned to ProtagonistA and said ,  Thank ProtagonistA so much , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB do n't know what ProtagonistB would have done without ProtagonistA . It was no problem ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm happy to help . And with that , ProtagonistA trotted off , back to ProtagonistA's house , feeling good about ProtagonistA and the good deed ProtagonistA had done . 
.
There was ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always friendly and would always go out of ProtagonistA's way to help the customers . One day , ProtagonistA was helping ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was getting frustrated and was about to leave when ProtagonistA found the item for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was so grateful and thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help . 
.
ProtagonistA stepped carefully down the steps of ProtagonistA's trailer , ProtagonistA's eyes resting on the blackened metal . It had been a long time since ProtagonistA 'd been out here , and everything looked different . The last time ProtagonistA 'd been here was with ProtagonistB , before ProtagonistB 'd passed away . Now , ProtagonistA was alone . ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way to the edge of the property , where the metal fence was . ProtagonistA leaned against it , looking out at the view . It was beautiful , in a way . The sun was setting , and the sky was a deep red . ProtagonistA could see the city in the distance , and it looked so different from up here . ProtagonistA sighed , wondering what ProtagonistA was doing here . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't go back to the city . ProtagonistA did n't have anything there anymore . But ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do out here , either . ProtagonistA supposed ProtagonistA would just have to take it one day at a time . 
.
ProtagonistA stood in the dim light of the distance , ProtagonistA's face downcast and blue eyes fixed on the ground below . ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and blistered . ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was or where ProtagonistA was going . ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's home in the city days ago , after a huge argument with ProtagonistA's parents . ProtagonistA had been wandering aimlessly ever since . ProtagonistA was tired and hungry , and ProtagonistA's stomach was growling . ProtagonistA had no money and no food . ProtagonistA had been sleeping in parks and on benches , and ProtagonistA was dirty and disheveled . ProtagonistA had thought about going back home , but ProtagonistA was too proud and stubborn . ProtagonistA did n't want to admit that ProtagonistA had made a mistake . ProtagonistA continued to walk , not knowing where to go or what to do . ProtagonistA felt lost and alone . As the sun began to set , ProtagonistA saw a sign for a small town up ahead . ProtagonistA decided to go there and see if ProtagonistA could find a place to stay for the night . As ProtagonistA entered the town , ProtagonistA was surprised to see that it was very quaint and charming . ProtagonistA walked down the main street , looking for a place to stay . ProtagonistA saw a sign for a bed and breakfast , and ProtagonistA decided to go there . ProtagonistA knocked on the door , and ProtagonistB answered . ProtagonistA explained ProtagonistA's situation , and ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA in . ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a warm meal and a comfortable bed . ProtagonistA was so grateful . The next morning , ProtagonistA woke up refreshed and ready to start a new day . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's kindness , and ProtagonistA set off down the road , feeling hopeful for the first time in days . 
.
ProtagonistA stood before ProtagonistA's desk , looking at the empty chair across from ProtagonistA . It had been a long time since ProtagonistA had last seen ProtagonistB . They had been through a lot together , and ProtagonistA had always considered ProtagonistB a brother . But now , things were different . ProtagonistA had changed . ProtagonistA was no longer the same person ProtagonistA had been when they first met . ProtagonistA had been through too much , and seen too much . The things ProtagonistA had once considered important no longer mattered to ProtagonistA . All that mattered now was survival . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would never understand what ProtagonistA had become . But that was okay . ProtagonistA did n't need anyone 's understanding . All ProtagonistA needed was to be left alone . ProtagonistA turned away from the empty chair and sat down at ProtagonistA's desk . There was work to be done . 
.
ProtagonistB eyed ProtagonistA , but had no intention of touching ProtagonistA . It was clear that ProtagonistA was not interested in anything ProtagonistB had to offer , and ProtagonistB was not about to force ProtagonistB on someone who did n't want ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB would just have to find someone else to spend ProtagonistB's time with . 
.
ProtagonistA , sat at ProtagonistB's desk , ProtagonistA's hooves resting on the very smooth surface of the paper . ProtagonistA had been a gift to ProtagonistB from ProtagonistB's daughter , and ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA dearly . ProtagonistA was always so well - behaved , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB just as much . Today , ProtagonistB was working on a very important project and ProtagonistB needed to concentrate . However , try as ProtagonistB might , ProtagonistB could n't help but notice ProtagonistA's cute little face peeking over the edge of the desk . ProtagonistB smiled and reached over to give ProtagonistA a pat on the head . I'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB really need to focus on this right now . Why do n't ProtagonistA go and play with ProtagonistA's toys for a little while?Amber seemed to understand , and ProtagonistA trotted off to the other room . ProtagonistB breathed a sigh of relief and went back to work . 
.
ProtagonistA stood in the doorway of the bank , and the crystal ball was spinning in ProtagonistA's fingers . ProtagonistA had been planning this heist for months , and everything was finally falling into place . ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB pacing back and forth in the lobby , and the tellers busy at their stations . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to act fast . ProtagonistA walked into the bank and approached ProtagonistB . Pretending to trip , ProtagonistA dropped the crystal ball . As ProtagonistB bent down to help ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA grabbed ProtagonistA's gun and pointed it at ProtagonistB .  This is a robbery ,  ProtagonistA yelled . The tellers immediately put their hands up , and ProtagonistA ordered them to fill ProtagonistA's backpack with cash . ProtagonistA could hear the sirens in the distance , but ProtagonistA did n't care . ProtagonistA had gotten away with the perfect crime . 
.
ProtagonistA cracked open ProtagonistA's newspaper , nudged the option beneath the headline Today , ProtagonistA was going to write a story about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a man who had it all - a successful career , a beautiful wife , and two healthy children . But despite all of ProtagonistB's blessings , ProtagonistB was unhappy . ProtagonistB was always working , and ProtagonistB never had time for ProtagonistB's family . ProtagonistB's wife was always nagging ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB's children were always getting into trouble . One day , ProtagonistB had had enough . ProtagonistB packed up ProtagonistB's things and left ProtagonistB's family behind . ProtagonistB moved to a small town and started a new life . ProtagonistB was finally happy . ProtagonistB had all the time in the world for ProtagonistB's hobbies and ProtagonistB's new friends . ProtagonistB's family was still important to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB was content without them . 
.
ProtagonistA sat up on the front step of the house with ProtagonistA's eyes closed . ProtagonistA had been sitting there for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had arrived home from work . ProtagonistA was too tired to go inside , too tired to even move . ProtagonistA just wanted to sit there and relax , and maybe doze off for a little while . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise . It sounded like someone was coming up the walk . ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw ProtagonistB approaching . As ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was a woman . ProtagonistB was carrying a large bag , and ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was in a hurry . ProtagonistB came up to ProtagonistA and said ,  ProtagonistB 'm sorry to bother ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB 'm looking for a place to stay . Do ProtagonistA know of any motels or hotels in the area?Bob shook ProtagonistA's head .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , but ProtagonistA do n't . ProtagonistA just moved here ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB sighed .  ProtagonistB see . Well , thank ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's time . ProtagonistB turned to leave , but ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB .  Wait!The woman turned back .  Yes?You can stay here ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA have a spare bedroom , and ProtagonistB 're welcome to use it . The woman 's face lit up .  Thank ProtagonistA so much ! ProtagonistA 're a lifesaver . ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's feet and led ProtagonistB into the house . ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB to the spare bedroom , and ProtagonistB gratefully accepted ProtagonistA's offer . ProtagonistA did n't know what had come over ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had been able to help ProtagonistB . It felt good to know that ProtagonistA had made a difference in someone 's life . 
.
ProtagonistA had been through so much , so many times , that ProtagonistA 'd reached the point where ProtagonistA 'd stopped caring what happened to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 'd been through heartbreak , loss , and betrayal , and ProtagonistA was tired of it all . ProtagonistA was tired of feeling like ProtagonistA was the only one who cared about anything . ProtagonistA was done with caring . So , when ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistA did n't even shed a tear . ProtagonistA just shrugged it off and went on with ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistB was gone . ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistB again . ProtagonistA was done caring . And when ProtagonistC left ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA did n't even try to stop ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA just let ProtagonistC go and went on with ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistC was gone . ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistC again . ProtagonistA was done caring . ProtagonistA had reached the point where nothing mattered to ProtagonistA anymore . ProtagonistA was just going through the motions of life , without any real purpose or meaning . ProtagonistA was just existing , not living . And ProtagonistA was okay with that . 
.
ProtagonistA stepped out of the greenhouse , whirled , and threw ProtagonistA's head back . ProtagonistA was met with a gust of cold wind that made ProtagonistA shiver . ProtagonistA had forgotten ProtagonistA's coat inside and now ProtagonistA regretted it . ProtagonistA turned back to the greenhouse to go get it when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB in the distance . ProtagonistB was a woman , and ProtagonistB was coming towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA had a feeling ProtagonistA was going to find out . 
.
I remember ProtagonistA ; and I remember , too , that ProtagonistA was born a little after the year 1852 , that ProtagonistA was of the small family , of the same kind as myself , though no one of that family should have been more than ten years my senior ; and that ProtagonistB , had no money , which only bordered on the imaginary , while ProtagonistB had everything else desired , and that everything ProtagonistB asked for was granted ProtagonistB without any regard to the wants of others . ProtagonistA and I were great friends , though we were not equals . I never had anything that ProtagonistA wanted , and ProtagonistA always had everything that I wanted ; but that never made any difference between us . 
.
ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's wings for more than a year when ProtagonistA discovered what ProtagonistB , had been planning for a good long while . ProtagonistB had been secretly stockpiling weapons and planning to overthrow ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA was horrified and went to ProtagonistC to warn ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC did n't believe ProtagonistA at first , but ProtagonistA was able to convince ProtagonistC to check ProtagonistB's quarters . Sure enough , there were weapons hidden everywhere . ProtagonistC had ProtagonistB arrested and ProtagonistB was sentenced to death . ProtagonistA was hailed as a hero and given a place of honor in the Pride . 
.
ProtagonistA peered into ProtagonistA's book , half - listening , half - expecting ProtagonistB to speak . ProtagonistA had been sitting in the same spot for hours , lost in the world of ProtagonistA's book . But ProtagonistB's voice always seemed to find ProtagonistA , no matter how deep ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's thoughts . What are ProtagonistA reading ?  ProtagonistB asked , sitting down next to ProtagonistA . The Chronicles of Narnia ,  ProtagonistA replied , not taking ProtagonistA's eyes off the page .  again ?  ProtagonistB sighed .  ProtagonistA 've read that series like , five times . ProtagonistA know ,  ProtagonistA said .  But ProtagonistA ca n't help it . ProtagonistA love it . I do n't understand what ProtagonistA see in those books ,  ProtagonistB said .  They 're just stories . They're more than that ,  ProtagonistA said .  They 're magical . And with that , ProtagonistA was pulled back into the world of ProtagonistA's book , forgetting all about ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistA sat down and just watched as ProtagonistB squatted beside ProtagonistA and watched ProtagonistA draw ProtagonistA's bow and day out . ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's big brown eyes and ProtagonistA could see the admiration in them . ProtagonistA had always been the better hunter , but ProtagonistB had never given up trying to beat ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistB 'll get ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said . I do n't doubt it ,  ProtagonistA replied . They sat there in silence for a while , just enjoying each other 's company . It was rare that they got to spend time together like this , with ProtagonistB always being busy with the farm and ProtagonistA always being out hunting . So , what did ProtagonistA get today ?  ProtagonistB asked . A deer ,  ProtagonistA replied .  A big one too . ProtagonistA 'm going to have enough meat to last ProtagonistA the winter . That 's great ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA 'm sure dad will be happy to hear that . They sat there for a while longer before ProtagonistB stood up . I should get back to the farm ,  ProtagonistB said .  Thanks for letting ProtagonistB watch ProtagonistA hunt . Thanks for watching ,  ProtagonistA replied . ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB's walk away , then went back to ProtagonistA's hunting . 
.
ProtagonistA sat at ProtagonistA's desk and watched as ProtagonistB leaned ProtagonistB's head onto ProtagonistA's shoulder . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistB's body relax as ProtagonistB took a deep breath and closed ProtagonistB's eyes . It had been a long day for both of them and they were both exhausted . ProtagonistA's mind wandered as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB sleep . ProtagonistA thought about all of the things they had been through together . ProtagonistA remembered the time when they were both younger and ProtagonistB had gotten lost in the city . ProtagonistA had been so worried about ProtagonistB but ProtagonistB had always had a knack for finding ProtagonistB's way home . ProtagonistA also remembered the time when ProtagonistB had broken ProtagonistB's leg and ProtagonistA had to carry ProtagonistB's home . ProtagonistB had been so brave and had never complained . ProtagonistA felt grateful to have ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA wrapped ProtagonistA's arms around ProtagonistB and held ProtagonistB close . 
.
ProtagonistA was walking home from school when ProtagonistA saw a man walking towards ProtagonistA . The man had a knife in his hand and ProtagonistA could see the look in his eyes . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die .  Oh , f - f - fucks if I kill you now ,  thought ProtagonistA , wishing ProtagonistB had not forbidden ProtagonistA to leave . ProtagonistA tried to run , but the man was too fast . ProtagonistA felt the knife enter ProtagonistA's back and ProtagonistA fell to the ground . As ProtagonistA lay there dying , ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistB and how ProtagonistB had always told ProtagonistA to be careful . 
.
ProtagonistA was lying on the floor of ProtagonistA's room , bending forward . ProtagonistA was trying to reach the remote that had fallen just out of ProtagonistA's reach . ProtagonistA could see it , just barely , but it might as well have been a mile away . ProtagonistA was just about to give up when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB coming down the hall . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was in for it if ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA like this . ProtagonistA had to think fast . 
.
ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistA's hoof out of ProtagonistB's eyes , but fished out a few strands of pony hair , like ProtagonistA always had . ProtagonistA was getting too old for this , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit nostalgic . After all , it was ProtagonistB's hair that ProtagonistA was holding in ProtagonistA's hoof . ProtagonistA remembered the first time ProtagonistA had held ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's hooves . ProtagonistB was so tiny and fragile . ProtagonistA was afraid ProtagonistA would break ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB was perfect . Over the years ProtagonistB had grown into a strong and beautiful young mare , and ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistB . Now , ProtagonistB was all grown up and did n't need ProtagonistA's help anymore . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to let ProtagonistB go , but it was hard . ProtagonistA was going to miss ProtagonistB so much . ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB one last hug and then turned to leave . As ProtagonistA walked away , ProtagonistA felt a tear run down ProtagonistA's cheek . 
.
ProtagonistA was a horse who lived on a farm . One day , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to help ProtagonistB with a job . ProtagonistA said yes , but ProtagonistA should have said no . The job was to pull a wagon full of hay . ProtagonistA was not strong enough to pull the wagon and ProtagonistA ended up getting stuck . ProtagonistB had to call for help to get ProtagonistA out . ProtagonistA was embarrassed and ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA had said no to the job . 
.
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day . First , ProtagonistA woke up late and had to rush to get ready for ProtagonistA's day . Then , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had forgotten to put on ProtagonistA's shoes and had to go back to ProtagonistA's room to find them . When ProtagonistA finally made it downstairs , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's keys upstairs . So , ProtagonistA had to go back up to get them . By the time ProtagonistA made it out the door , ProtagonistA was already running late . ProtagonistA rushed to ProtagonistA's car , but when ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had locked ProtagonistA's keys in the house . ProtagonistA did n't have time to go back , so ProtagonistA had to call ProtagonistB . By the time ProtagonistB arrived , ProtagonistA was so frazzled , ProtagonistA forgot to pay ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA finally made it to work , but ProtagonistA's boss was not happy . ProtagonistA was given a stern talking to and told that if ProtagonistA did n't shape up , ProtagonistA would be fired . ProtagonistA's day just kept getting worse . ProtagonistA sat at ProtagonistA's desk , trying to concentrate on ProtagonistA's work , but ProtagonistA was so distracted , ProtagonistA could n't focus . ProtagonistA was so lost in thought , ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistA's co - worker come up to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA okay?Bob turned to see ProtagonistA's co - worker , Concerned .  ProtagonistA 'm fine ,  ProtagonistA lied . ProtagonistA do n't look fine . ProtagonistA look like ProtagonistA 're about to have a breakdown . I'm fine , really . But ProtagonistA was n't fine . ProtagonistA was about to lose ProtagonistA's job , ProtagonistA had no money to pay ProtagonistA's rent , and ProtagonistA was pretty sure ProtagonistA's girlfriend was about to break up with ProtagonistA . As ProtagonistA sat there , staring at ProtagonistA's computer screen , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's keys at home again . ProtagonistA was having the worst day ever . 
.
ProtagonistA had been having a great day . ProtagonistA had just finished up at work and was looking forward to a relaxing evening at home . But when ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's front door , ProtagonistA froze . There was ProtagonistB standing there , and ProtagonistB did n't look friendly . ProtagonistA was about to turn and run when ProtagonistB spoke .  Hello , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB 'm Chord the Pestilent . ProtagonistB 've come for ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA did n't want to go with ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was afraid of what would happen if ProtagonistA did n't . So ProtagonistA reluctantly followed ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA was led away . 
.
ProtagonistA stood and watched ProtagonistA's sister Dash ProtagonistB float by . It was a hot day and ProtagonistB was enjoying the cool water . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could join ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to stay on the bank and watch ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistB was lying down under the wing of ProtagonistA , staring up at ProtagonistA's blue and white Pip Puff . The Pip Puff was so big and fluffy that it almost looked like a cloud . ProtagonistB felt so happy and content lying there , looking up at the sky and listening to the sound of ProtagonistA's gentle snoring . ProtagonistB could have stayed there forever . 
.
At the time , ProtagonistB was just about to head off to meet ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had been bugging ProtagonistB for weeks to come over and hang out , and ProtagonistB had been putting it off . But ProtagonistA was insistent , and ProtagonistB finally relented . As ProtagonistB was about to leave , ProtagonistC stopped ProtagonistB . ProtagonistC said ,  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA really wants ProtagonistB to come over . ProtagonistA 's been talking about ProtagonistB non - stop . ProtagonistC think it would mean a lot to ProtagonistA if ProtagonistB came over . And ProtagonistC promise , we wo n't let ProtagonistB leave until ProtagonistB 've convinced ProtagonistA to come over to ProtagonistB's house . ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistC was right . ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately , and ProtagonistB had been meaning to reach out to ProtagonistA but just had n't gotten around to it . So ProtagonistB agreed , and headed over to ProtagonistA's house . When ProtagonistB got there , ProtagonistA was thrilled to see ProtagonistB . They hung out for a while , catching up on everything that had happened since they last saw each other . Eventually , ProtagonistB broached the subject of ProtagonistA coming over to ProtagonistB's house . ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistB was persistent . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about all the fun they would have and how much ProtagonistA would enjoy it . Eventually , ProtagonistA relented and agreed to come over to ProtagonistB's house . They made plans to meet up the following week . As ProtagonistB left , ProtagonistC said ,  Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB . This means a lot to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB felt good as ProtagonistB walked home . ProtagonistB was glad ProtagonistB had gone over to ProtagonistA's house , and ProtagonistB was looking forward to next week when ProtagonistA would come over to ProtagonistB's house . 
.
ProtagonistA was standing there , wondering how to explain ProtagonistA's pregnancy without sounding like an idiot . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be home soon , and ProtagonistA did n't want to have to explain why ProtagonistA was pregnant . ProtagonistA had been trying to keep it a secret from ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would eventually find out . ProtagonistA was just hoping that ProtagonistB would be understanding . When ProtagonistB walked in , ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was not happy . ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what was going on , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to tell ProtagonistB the truth . ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA had been wondering how to explain ProtagonistA's pregnancy without sounding like an idiot , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to tell ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was sorry for not being honest with ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was scared of ProtagonistB's reaction . Fortunately , ProtagonistB was understanding . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was not mad , and that ProtagonistB would support ProtagonistA through everything . ProtagonistB knew that it would be a difficult road ahead , but ProtagonistB was there for ProtagonistA . 
.
ProtagonistA had ruptured ProtagonistA's ACL playing football with ProtagonistA's friends and was now facing a long road to recovery . ProtagonistA was lucky that ProtagonistB was there to help ProtagonistA through it . ProtagonistB had been ProtagonistA's rock during the tough times and had even helped ProtagonistA to accept ProtagonistA's sexuality . Now , ProtagonistA was facing another challenge , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be there for ProtagonistA every step of the way . 
.
Now , said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA sat down in ProtagonistA's chair , ProtagonistA want to tell you a story . It 's about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was starving and dehydrated , and ProtagonistB had given up hope of ever being found . One day , ProtagonistB came across a stream . ProtagonistB drank from it and filled ProtagonistB's canteen . ProtagonistB followed the stream for miles , and it led ProtagonistB to a small cabin in the woods . ProtagonistB knocked on the door , and ProtagonistC answered . ProtagonistC welcomed ProtagonistB in and gave ProtagonistB food and water . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistC ProtagonistB's story , and ProtagonistC listened . ProtagonistB stayed with ProtagonistC for the rest of ProtagonistB's days . 
.
ProtagonistA sat in the back seat of ProtagonistA's pink and white pony wagon and watched the clouds drift away . ProtagonistA loved the way they looked like fluffy cotton candy . ProtagonistA's mom was driving the wagon and ProtagonistA's dad was walking alongside , leading the pony . They were on their way to the park for a picnic . ProtagonistB , was sitting in the front seat next to their mom . ProtagonistB was chattering away , telling ProtagonistB's mom about ProtagonistB's day at school . ProtagonistA was content to just sit back and enjoy the ride . ProtagonistA loved spending time with ProtagonistA's family and being outdoors . 
.
ProtagonistA had been walking through the desert for days , ProtagonistA's water supply running low . ProtagonistA was about to give up hope when ProtagonistA saw a small oasis in the distance . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting in the shade of a palm tree . ProtagonistA did n't come out of the desert for no good reason ,  said ProtagonistB , as the words struck up in ProtagonistB's throat .  ProtagonistB was just about to give up when ProtagonistB saw this oasis . It 's a ProtagonistA was so grateful to ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's help that ProtagonistA decided to stay with ProtagonistB and help ProtagonistB protect the oasis from others who might want to take it for themselves . Together , they built a small shelter and made the oasis their home . 
.
ProtagonistA stood with ProtagonistA's hooves on the other side of the barrier , watching the ponies through the small crack in the glass . ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a pony , but ProtagonistA's hooves were too big and ProtagonistA's body was too bulky . ProtagonistA had tried to shrink ProtagonistA down , but it never worked . The ponies always ran away from ProtagonistA , afraid of ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was n't afraid of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB even came up to ProtagonistA and sniffed ProtagonistA's nose . They became friends , and ProtagonistA started visiting ProtagonistB every day . ProtagonistA would stand on the other side of the barrier and watch ProtagonistB's play with the other ponies . One day , ProtagonistB disappeared . ProtagonistA asked the other ponies what had happened to ProtagonistB , but they would n't tell ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was heartbroken and stopped visiting the ponies altogether . A few weeks later , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB again . ProtagonistB was on the other side of the barrier , just like ProtagonistA . It turned out that ProtagonistB had been shrunk down to ProtagonistA's size , and ProtagonistB was now stuck on the other side just like ProtagonistA was . The two of them were finally able to be together , and they were happy . 
.
It was getting late , and Twilight was getting tired . ProtagonistA had been listening to ProtagonistB's story for hours , and ProtagonistA still had so many questions . But ProtagonistA could n't bear to end ProtagonistB's story without telling ProtagonistB of the man who had saved ProtagonistB's life and placed ProtagonistB in the care of ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB had been on the run from the law for years , and ProtagonistB was getting tired . ProtagonistB had been hiding out in the woods , living off the land and stealing what ProtagonistB needed to survive . But one day , ProtagonistB was caught by a group of men who were intent on taking ProtagonistB back to the city to stand trial . ProtagonistB was sure that ProtagonistB was going to die , but then the most amazing thing happened . A man appeared out of nowhere and fought off the men who were trying to capture ProtagonistB . The man told ProtagonistB to run and not look back . ProtagonistB did as ProtagonistB was told , and ProtagonistB made ProtagonistB's way to the farm of ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC took ProtagonistB in and nursed ProtagonistB back to health . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistC everything that had happened , and ProtagonistC promised to help ProtagonistB get ProtagonistB's life back on track . Thanks to the man who had saved ProtagonistB's life , and ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB was finally able to start over . ProtagonistB would never forget the kindness that had been shown to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB vowed to pay it forward however ProtagonistB could . 
.
It was in the year 1763 when , in a county in western France , a small town named Vernay was formed , and the village of Neuve - Chalmers had its first residents . The name and the first and only dame which has ever been mentioned in the history of France , was ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was well known in the world for ProtagonistA's literary talent and for ProtagonistA's indomitable resolution . In the year 1789 , the French Revolution began , and Neuve - Chalmers was one of the first towns to be affected . The people were angry and resentful of the way they had been treated by the monarchy , and they were determined to make a change . On the night of the 4th of August , a group of men , led by Bob Moodie , marched into the town square and demanded that ProtagonistB surrender the keys to the town hall . When ProtagonistB refused , Bob Moodie threatened to kill ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB still refused , so Bob Moodie made good on his threat and shot ProtagonistB dead . The town hall was stormed and the townspeople took control . Neuve - Chalmers was renamed Vernay , in honor of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA became known as the heroine of the Revolution . 
.
ProtagonistA rested ProtagonistA's forelegs on ProtagonistA's elbows and let out a deep breath . It had been a long day at work and ProtagonistA was ready to relax . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let ProtagonistA's mind wander . ProtagonistA thought about all the things ProtagonistA had to do tomorrow and sighed . ProtagonistA was so tired and just wanted to sleep . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise . It sounded like someone was crying . ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw ProtagonistB standing in the shadows . ProtagonistB was sobbing and looked like ProtagonistB was in pain . ProtagonistA felt bad for ProtagonistB and wanted to help . ProtagonistA stood up and walked over to ProtagonistB .  Are ProtagonistB okay ?  ProtagonistA asked . ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with tears in ProtagonistB's eyes and shook ProtagonistB's head .  No , ProtagonistB 'm not okay ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB's husband just left ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB do n't know what to do . ProtagonistA did n't know what to say , but ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA needed to say something .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said .  That must be really hard for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB nodded and wiped ProtagonistB's tears .  It is ,  ProtagonistB said .  But ProtagonistB 'll be okay . ProtagonistB just need some time . ProtagonistA nodded and said ,  If ProtagonistB need anything , just let ProtagonistA know .  Then ProtagonistA turned and walked away . 
.
ProtagonistA looked rather like a bimbos older or younger than ProtagonistA had been when ProtagonistA first met ProtagonistB for the first time , considering the circumstances . ProtagonistA had been through a lot since then , and it showed in the lines on ProtagonistA's face and the gray in ProtagonistA's hair . But ProtagonistB still saw ProtagonistA . 
.
ProtagonistA had been travelling west , but ProtagonistA's eyes had been paid to the south , where the sun shone and the air was still and fragrant , the colour of wheat or millet . ProtagonistA had been on the road for weeks , and ProtagonistA's supplies were running low . ProtagonistA was getting desperate . One day , ProtagonistA came across a small farmhouse in the middle of nowhere . It looked abandoned , but ProtagonistA decided to check it out anyway . ProtagonistA knocked on the door , but there was no answer . ProtagonistA peered in the window and saw ProtagonistB inside , sitting in a rocking chair . ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB did n't respond . ProtagonistA tried the door , but it was locked . ProtagonistA knocked again , harder this time . Finally , ProtagonistB got up and came to the door . ProtagonistB was an old woman , and ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB had seen better days . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB had any food , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB did n't have much , but ProtagonistB could give ProtagonistA some of ProtagonistB's husband 's old clothes . ProtagonistA was grateful for the clothes and ProtagonistB's kindness . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB needed anything , but ProtagonistB just shook ProtagonistB's head and told ProtagonistA to be on ProtagonistA's way . ProtagonistA continued on ProtagonistA's journey , but ProtagonistA could n't get ProtagonistB out of ProtagonistA's mind . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could have done more for ProtagonistB . A few days later , ProtagonistA came across a group of travellers . They were heading south , to the sun and the fragrant air . They asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA wanted to join them , and ProtagonistA did . As they travelled , ProtagonistA told them about ProtagonistB and how ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could have helped ProtagonistB more . The group was sympathetic , and they decided to go back and check on ProtagonistB . When they arrived at the farmhouse , they found that ProtagonistB had passed away . But they also found that ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistA a small bag of food and a note thanking ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's kindness . 
.
ProtagonistB did not ask ProtagonistA to do anything , said Applejack , and it was not a question ProtagonistA had thought about thoroughly , much less questioned . ProtagonistA just nodded ProtagonistA's head in response , not really sure what to say . It was true , ProtagonistB had never asked ProtagonistA to do anything , not even chores around the house . And yet , here ProtagonistA was , about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime . ProtagonistA had always wanted to travel the world , and now ProtagonistA finally had the chance . ProtagonistA was going to be a part of a travelling circus , and ProtagonistA could not be more excited . ProtagonistB had never asked ProtagonistA to do anything , but ProtagonistB had always supported ProtagonistA's dreams . And now , here ProtagonistA was , about to make them come true . ProtagonistA hugged ProtagonistB tightly , promising to come back and visit ProtagonistB as often as ProtagonistA could . Then , with a final wave , ProtagonistA was off , ready to start the adventure of a lifetime . 
.
ProtagonistB had been so anxious for ProtagonistA to take ProtagonistA's first flight ProtagonistB had not known until that moment that the spell they were about to cast was for something else altogether . In ProtagonistB's haste to get ProtagonistA ready for ProtagonistA's big day , ProtagonistB had not realized that the other witches and wizards in the coven had other plans for ProtagonistA . As the spell began to take hold , ProtagonistB could see the look of terror in ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistB tried to fight against it , but it was too late . ProtagonistA was caught in the spell and would be used as a vessel for the dark forces that the coven worshipped . There was nothing ProtagonistB could do but watch as ProtagonistA was taken over by the evil spirits . ProtagonistB could only hope that someday ProtagonistA would be able to break free from their control and live a normal life . 
.
ProtagonistB watched as ProtagonistA twisted and turned , ProtagonistA's hooves shifting as ProtagonistA tried to keep the position . The other horses in the field had long since given up and gone to graze , but ProtagonistA was determined to get the last bit of hay . Finally , ProtagonistA gave up and walked over to ProtagonistB , nuzzling ProtagonistA's nose in ProtagonistB's direction . ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a pat on the head , understanding ProtagonistA's determination . 
.
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the rocking chair , ProtagonistB's hooves beneath ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA looked out at the sunset , thinking about all the things that had happened in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA 'd been through a lot , but ProtagonistA was still here , still fighting . ProtagonistA was grateful for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that as long as ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA could make it through anything . 
.
ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's wings for four years when ProtagonistA discovered that ProtagonistA was pregnant . It was a shock to ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA had always been careful to avoid getting pregnant . ProtagonistA did n't know how it had happened , but ProtagonistA was sure that it was a mistake . ProtagonistA did n't want to be a father , not yet . ProtagonistA was still too young and too irresponsible . ProtagonistA considered getting an abortion , but ProtagonistA could n't bring ProtagonistA to do it . ProtagonistA knew that it would be the right thing to do , but ProtagonistA just could n't bring ProtagonistA to do it . ProtagonistA did n't want to kill ProtagonistB . Instead , ProtagonistA decided to keep ProtagonistB and raise ProtagonistB on ProtagonistA's own . ProtagonistA knew it would be hard , but ProtagonistA was determined to do it . ProtagonistA would make it work , somehow . Four years later , ProtagonistB was born . ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB's ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was the light of ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB more than anything . ProtagonistA had been worried about being a father , but it turned out that ProtagonistA was a natural . ProtagonistA was patient and kind , and ProtagonistA always knew just what to do . ProtagonistA was everything that ProtagonistB needed , and ProtagonistB thrived under ProtagonistA's care . ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA had made the decision to keep ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA . 
.
When ProtagonistA had reached the age of six years old , ProtagonistA began to change into the great doll , who ProtagonistA was always about . ProtagonistA would sit for hours in front of the mirror , combing ProtagonistA's hair and straightening ProtagonistA's clothes . ProtagonistB would often find ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's room , talking to ProtagonistA in a high - pitched voice .  ProtagonistA , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB would ask . But ProtagonistA would just smile and continue talking to the doll . One day , ProtagonistB came into ProtagonistA's room and found ProtagonistA sitting on the floor , surrounded by dolls . ProtagonistA was talking to them in a soft voice , as if ProtagonistA was telling them a secret . When ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was doing , ProtagonistA just smiled and said ,  ProtagonistA 'm becoming the great doll .  And from that day on , ProtagonistA was never the same again . 
.
ProtagonistA was a simple farm horse who loved nothing more than a good roll in the mud and a carrot or two . ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life until one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . From the moment ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was in trouble . ProtagonistB was watching over ProtagonistA's hooves - a delicate balance , ProtagonistA reasoned , between worry and excitement - and Shining Armor was resting on ProtagonistA's shoulder . ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistA's heart racing as ProtagonistA looked into ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was in for the ride of ProtagonistA's life . 
.
ProtagonistA was sitting in the field of our estate , looking at a photograph of ProtagonistB , with the utmost circumstance of safety . ProtagonistA was thinking about how much had changed since ProtagonistB had passed away . It felt like only yesterday that they were sitting in that field together , laughing and joking and enjoying the sunshine . Now , ProtagonistA was all alone . ProtagonistA sighed and put the photograph away , getting to ProtagonistA's feet . ProtagonistA dusted off ProtagonistA's trousers and decided to go for a walk . As ProtagonistA wandered through the estate , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a pang of sadness at all the memories that were now hidden away in the past . 
.
ProtagonistB watched as ProtagonistA twisted and turned , ProtagonistA's hooves shifting as ProtagonistA tried to keep the position . The other horses in the field were grazing peacefully , but ProtagonistA just could n't seem to find a comfortable spot . ProtagonistB felt sorry for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB knew that there was nothing ProtagonistB could do to help . ProtagonistA would just have to find ProtagonistA's own way to relax . 
.
The house where ProtagonistA had lived with ProtagonistA's family had stood empty from the start . It was a big , old house that had been in the family for generations . ProtagonistA's parents had died when ProtagonistA was a child , and ProtagonistA had been raised by ProtagonistA's grandparents . When they died , ProtagonistA was the only one left . ProtagonistA did n't want to sell the house , but ProtagonistA could n't keep it up by ProtagonistA . So , it sat empty . ProtagonistA would come by every now and then to check on it , but it was just too much for ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA got a call from ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had a buyer for the house . ProtagonistA was surprised , but happy . ProtagonistA had been hoping to sell it for years . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB to go ahead and finalize the sale . The next day , ProtagonistA went to the house to sign the papers . ProtagonistA was surprised to see that the new owners were a young couple with a child . They told ProtagonistA that they had always wanted a big , old house like this and they were excited to make it their home . ProtagonistA was happy to see that the house was going to a good family . ProtagonistA said goodbye and went on ProtagonistA's way . The house sat empty for years , but it was finally going to be loved again . 
.
ProtagonistB was born as the son of a salaried workman in the midst of a profusion of pre - war industries of industrial importance , and who , having hung on throughout a highly successful career , has made ProtagonistA's fortune by , and in fact made ProtagonistA's fortune quite a while ago , by the methods which ProtagonistA has adopted to capitalize upon ProtagonistA's great fortune , although of late the conflict of interest which ProtagonistC enjoyed , in procuring a certain amount of capital , has become a serious matter .Bob 's father worked hard to provide for his family and instilled the importance of a good work ethic in ProtagonistB . When ProtagonistB was old enough , ProtagonistB started working in one of the pre - war industries and quickly rose through the ranks . Seeing the potential for making a lot of money , ProtagonistB started to capitalize on ProtagonistB's position and soon made a fortune . However , lately ProtagonistB has been having some conflict with ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC is also in a position to make a lot of money , but ProtagonistC has been using some of ProtagonistC's capital to help ProtagonistB out . ProtagonistB is not sure if ProtagonistB wants to continue this arrangement , as it could be seen as a conflict of interest . ProtagonistB is still debating what to do , but ProtagonistB knows that whatever ProtagonistB decides , ProtagonistB will be successful .

ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was the only unicorn . ProtagonistA had never seen another one like ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA was the only one in the world . One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was so happy to finally meet another unicorn . 
.
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner . ProtagonistA never really felt like ProtagonistA fit in anywhere . So , when ProtagonistA finally met ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was thrilled . Unfortunately , ProtagonistB turned out to be a psychopath who wanted nothing more than to see ProtagonistA dead . ProtagonistA should have known something was wrong when ProtagonistB started making strange comments about wanting to kill people . But ProtagonistA did n't want to believe that ProtagonistB could be so dark and twisted . Sadly , ProtagonistA was wrong . One night , ProtagonistB attacked ProtagonistA with a knife , intent on killing ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was only able to survive by pure luck , and ProtagonistA was left with some serious injuries . It was the first night of the rest of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was finally able to see ProtagonistB for the monster that ProtagonistB was . And ProtagonistA was determined to make sure that ProtagonistA would never be victimized like that again .

ProtagonistA had been taking the ferry down to the harbor every day for years . ProtagonistA knew every twist and turn of the winding stone steps . But today , something was different . As ProtagonistA took the ferry down the steps , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB lying at the bottom . ProtagonistB , please get up ,  said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA took the ferry down the winding stone steps into the harbor .  ProtagonistA ca n't leave ProtagonistB here . But ProtagonistB did n't move . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA had never seen anyone like ProtagonistB before . ProtagonistB was wearing strange clothes and ProtagonistB's skin was a different color . ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA should help ProtagonistB or not . Finally , ProtagonistA made up ProtagonistA's mind . ProtagonistA would help ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA went down to ProtagonistB and tried to lift ProtagonistB up , but ProtagonistB was too heavy . ProtagonistA could n't do it by ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA shouted for help , but no one came . Finally , ProtagonistA saw a group of men coming down the steps . They were laughing and joking , but when they saw ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB , they stopped . What 's going on here ?  one of the men asked . I found ProtagonistB at the bottom of the steps . ProtagonistA think ProtagonistB 's hurt ,  ProtagonistA said . The men hesitated for a moment , but then they came over and helped ProtagonistA lift ProtagonistB . They carried ProtagonistB up the steps and into the town . ProtagonistA never saw ProtagonistB again , but ProtagonistA always wondered what happened to ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistA had seen a lot of death in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA 'd been a soldier for years , and ProtagonistA 'd seen ProtagonistA's friends die in battle . But this was different . This was cold , calculated murder . And the worst part was , ProtagonistA was powerless to stop it . ProtagonistA watched , frozen in horror , as the man was killed . It was brutal , and it was quick . There was no mercy , no hesitation . ProtagonistB did n't even seem to care that ProtagonistA was watching . It was over in seconds . The man was dead , and ProtagonistA was left alone with his body . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA felt sick to ProtagonistA's stomach , and ProtagonistA wanted to vomit . But ProtagonistA forced ProtagonistA to stay calm . ProtagonistA had to think . ProtagonistB was still out there , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was next . 
.
ProtagonistA had been married for years , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly . However , lately ProtagonistA had been feeling restless . ProtagonistA had always wanted to travel and see the world , and now that ProtagonistB was getting older , ProtagonistA felt like it was finally time to do something for ProtagonistA . So , one day , ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and left ProtagonistB alone in the garden . ProtagonistA went to pick up the newspaper and dipped it into ProtagonistA's cupboard , wishing ProtagonistA had a camera and a memory of where ProtagonistA had put it the week before . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would be heartbroken when ProtagonistA left , but ProtagonistA did n't want to burden ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's wanderlust . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would be better off without ProtagonistA . As ProtagonistA drove away from ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA felt a mixture of sadness and excitement . ProtagonistA was sad to be leaving ProtagonistB behind , but ProtagonistA was also excited to finally be embarking on ProtagonistA's own adventure . Who knows what the future holds ? ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA drove into the sunset . 
.
ProtagonistA usually sat at ProtagonistA's desk and wrote in a notebook . ProtagonistA was a writer , and ProtagonistA found that writing in a notebook was the best way for ProtagonistA to get ProtagonistA's ideas down . Today , however , ProtagonistA was having trouble focusing . ProtagonistA kept thinking about the fight ProtagonistA had with ProtagonistB the night before . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to apologize to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was n't sure how to go about it . ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear ProtagonistC come in .  ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said ,  ProtagonistC need to talk to ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA turned to ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistC could see the sadness in ProtagonistA's eyes .  What 's wrong ?  ProtagonistC asked .  Nothing ,  ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA 'm just having a bad day .  
.
ProtagonistA was a unicorn , and ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's best friend . ProtagonistB trusted ProtagonistA with everything , even ProtagonistB's tongue . But one day , ProtagonistA betrayed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA said something mean to ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB felt ProtagonistB's heart break . ProtagonistB realized then that ProtagonistB never should have trusted ProtagonistA , because ProtagonistA was n't real . ProtagonistA was just a figment of ProtagonistB's imagination . 
.
Slow , steady , and thoughtful , the moment ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's seat at the table , Equestrians moved through the dark and the undulating hall of the palace , picking vixens and lasses out of the crowd and casting them away to dance with the three most beautiful sisters of the Siras Academy . The music was low and sensual , and the air was thick with the scent of jasmine and musk . ProtagonistA's heart quickened as ProtagonistA watched the sisters move gracefully around the room . ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it . They were like goddesses . Suddenly , ProtagonistB , turned and looked directly at ProtagonistA . Their eyes locked , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart skip a beat . ProtagonistB smiled , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's whole body relax . ProtagonistA knew in that moment that ProtagonistA was going to dance with ProtagonistB . Slowly , ProtagonistA stood up and made ProtagonistA's way across the room . ProtagonistA could feel the eyes of the other guests on ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't care . All ProtagonistA could focus on was ProtagonistB . When ProtagonistA reached ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA's hand and led ProtagonistA onto the dance floor . The music swelled around them , and they began to move . It was as if they were one person . They flowed together effortlessly , their bodies molding to each other perfectly . ProtagonistA had never felt so alive . As the music came to a close , ProtagonistB dipped ProtagonistA low and kissed ProtagonistA lightly on the lips . ProtagonistA's head was spinning . ProtagonistA had never felt this way before . ProtagonistB pulled away and smiled at ProtagonistA .  Thank ProtagonistA for the dance ,  ProtagonistB said . ProtagonistA could barely find the words to respond .  It was ProtagonistA's pleasure ,  ProtagonistA managed to say . ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB walk away , feeling like ProtagonistA had just been given the most precious gift in the world . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget this night . 
.
In the days when ProtagonistA tried to forget or suppress all sense of history , ProtagonistA made a point of discussing ProtagonistA's own ministry with ProtagonistA's fellow church members and those whom ProtagonistA met through the temple . ProtagonistA was always careful to keep ProtagonistA's stories about ProtagonistA's ministry separate from ProtagonistA's stories about ProtagonistA's personal life . This way , ProtagonistA could forget about ProtagonistA's past and focus on the present . However , one day , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to tell ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's ministry . ProtagonistA hesitated at first , but then ProtagonistA began to open up . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the people ProtagonistA had met and the places ProtagonistA had been . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the good times and the bad times . As ProtagonistA spoke , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been suppressing ProtagonistA's memories for too long . ProtagonistA had been trying to forget about ProtagonistA's past , but it was time to face it . ProtagonistB listened patiently as ProtagonistA spoke , and ProtagonistB was there for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA needed ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistA , in my modest opinion , was walking home in ProtagonistA's own shoes , with ProtagonistA's hat on , from the back of the church , where ProtagonistA had been having the rough passage due to he , and which was . ProtagonistA was a bit down in the dumps , but ProtagonistA tried to keep ProtagonistA's chin up . ProtagonistA was looking forward to getting home , taking ProtagonistA's shoes off , and putting ProtagonistA's feet up . When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA was surprised to see ProtagonistB waiting for ProtagonistA at the door . ProtagonistB was crying and looked very upset . ProtagonistA's heart sank . ProtagonistA knew that something was wrong . Turns out , ProtagonistB had been diagnosed with cancer . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had failed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was supposed to be the strong one , but ProtagonistA just could n't handle it . ProtagonistA broke down in tears and hugged ProtagonistB tightly . They both knew that this was going to be a long , hard battle , but they were ready to fight it together .

The U - boat crash into the moor was a horrific sight . The large ship was covered in splinters , and there was a corpse of ProtagonistA inside . It was clear that ProtagonistA had been murdered in some strange way . ProtagonistB was aboard the ship when it happened , and ProtagonistB was the one who first saw it . ProtagonistB was horrified by what ProtagonistB saw , and ProtagonistB knew that something strange had happened .

ProtagonistB had been battling ovarian cancer for years , and ProtagonistA had been by ProtagonistB's side every step of the way . ProtagonistA had been with ProtagonistB in the hospital the night before ProtagonistB passed away , holding ProtagonistB's hand and telling ProtagonistB how much ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB . The next morning , ProtagonistA woke up from a dream in which ProtagonistB was still alive and healthy . ProtagonistA was so overwhelmed with happiness and relief that ProtagonistA started to cry . It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever experienced a dream like this , and it was the most powerful one ProtagonistA 'd ever had .

ProtagonistA thought that was it then , ProtagonistA's dear friend said as ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's back on the landscape . All will be well , ProtagonistA thought . ProtagonistA am free , though ProtagonistA doubt it . Even an assassination attempt in the capital would be unlikely . Oh , ProtagonistA know it 's a bad idea . ProtagonistA was at a party once . It was a grand affair , hosted by the richest man in the city . ProtagonistA had been invited because ProtagonistA was good friends with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA remembered how out of place ProtagonistA felt , surrounded by the wealthy elite . ProtagonistA had been sipping on a glass of wine , when ProtagonistA overheard two men talking . I do n't know why he 's still alive . We 've tried everything . I know , but we ca n't keep trying . It 's too risky . ProtagonistA did n't know who they were talking about , but ProtagonistA had a feeling it was n't good . ProtagonistA did n't want to get involved , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do something . ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB and told ProtagonistB what ProtagonistA had overheard . ProtagonistB was horrified . ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB's father had enemies , but ProtagonistB never thought they would go this far . ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help and promised to keep ProtagonistA safe . ProtagonistA thought that was the end of it , but ProtagonistA was wrong . A few weeks later , ProtagonistA was attacked in the street . ProtagonistA was beaten and left for dead , but ProtagonistA survived . ProtagonistA knew then that ProtagonistA had to leave the city . ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's friend and said goodbye . ProtagonistA promised to keep in touch , but ProtagonistA never did . ProtagonistA knew it was for the best . ProtagonistA had to start a new life , somewhere far away from the danger .

In the year of our Lord 2001 , ProtagonistA was sitting in the chair , with ProtagonistA's hat on the mantelpiece , and ProtagonistB next to ProtagonistA , which was a very strange arrangement . ProtagonistA was a large man , with a hearty laugh and a jovial disposition . ProtagonistB was quiet and withdrawn , with a nervous air about ProtagonistB . They had been sitting in silence for some time , when ProtagonistB finally spoke . ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB need to ask ProtagonistA a favor . ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB , a little taken aback .  Sure , anything ProtagonistB need . I need ProtagonistA to kill ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was stunned . ProtagonistA did n't know what to say or how to respond . ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA imploringly . ProtagonistB ca n't go on living like this . ProtagonistB 'm in so much pain , ProtagonistA . Please , just end it for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was torn . ProtagonistA did n't want to kill ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could see the pain and suffering ProtagonistB was in . Finally , ProtagonistA nodded . Okay , ProtagonistA 'll do it . The smaller man looked relieved . ProtagonistA got up and went to the mantelpiece , where ProtagonistA took down ProtagonistA's hat . ProtagonistA walked back to ProtagonistB and put the hat on ProtagonistB's head . I'm sorry , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said , before pulling the trigger . 
.
 ProtagonistA 've done well , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB , looking up at the heavens with a kind of dislike and a kind of curiosity .  ProtagonistA 've really done it .  ProtagonistA had always been the successful one , the one who had made something of ProtagonistA . And ProtagonistB had always been happy for ProtagonistA . But now , sitting next to each other on a bench in the park , looking up at the stars , ProtagonistB felt a twinge of jealousy .  What do ProtagonistA mean ?  ProtagonistB asked .  ProtagonistA mean , ProtagonistA 've done well ,  said ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA 've made something of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 're successful .   So ?   So , ProtagonistB 'm happy for ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA put ProtagonistA's hand on ProtagonistB's shoulder and gave ProtagonistB a reassuring squeeze .  ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB are ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA know .  
.
One minute , ProtagonistA was standing in front of ProtagonistA's desk , examining the file ProtagonistA had been given . The next minute , ProtagonistA was on the floor , unconscious . ProtagonistA had been hit on the head with a paperweight from behind , and was now bleeding profusely from the wound . ProtagonistB had been quick and efficient , and ProtagonistA never even saw ProtagonistB coming . 
.
ProtagonistA had always been a hard worker . ProtagonistA started out working in ProtagonistA's father 's horse and carriage business when ProtagonistA was just a boy . When ProtagonistA was old enough , ProtagonistA bought ProtagonistA's own horse and carriage and started out on ProtagonistA's own . ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA did n't have the money to compete with the other carriage businesses in the city , so ProtagonistA started doing odd jobs for people . ProtagonistA would do anything they asked , no matter how dirty or difficult it was . ProtagonistA quickly gained a reputation as a reliable and honest worker , and people started recommending ProtagonistA to their friends . Before long , ProtagonistA had more work than ProtagonistA could handle . ProtagonistA was able to save up enough money to buy a small house in the city , and ProtagonistA started to furnish it with the things ProtagonistA needed . ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life and did n't need anything more . ProtagonistA was happy just doing ProtagonistA's work and being able to provide for ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA was approached by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB needed someone who was honest and hardworking , and that ProtagonistB had heard good things about ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB offered ProtagonistA a large sum of money to do the job , and ProtagonistA accepted . ProtagonistA was given a key to a building in the city and told to go there and wait for further instructions . ProtagonistA did as ProtagonistA was told and waited outside the building . After a few minutes , ProtagonistC came out and told ProtagonistA to follow ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistC into the building and down a long hallway . ProtagonistC opened a door and motioned for ProtagonistA to go inside . ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a large room with a table in the center . On the table was a pile of money . ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was to count the money and then put it into bags . ProtagonistA did as ProtagonistA was told and was soon finished . ProtagonistC thanked ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA would be paid handsomely for ProtagonistA's work . ProtagonistA was amazed at how much money ProtagonistA had just counted . ProtagonistA had never seen so much money in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA was now a rich man , and ProtagonistA knew it would n't be long before ProtagonistA was able to buy ProtagonistA's own horse and carriage business . 
.

In the early summer of 1831 , ProtagonistA was living in the vast old house of ProtagonistA's cousin , the lady Madame Bors ( the name of the owner of the property ) , in a part of Pannonward called the Park . The Park was a beautiful , sprawling estate with a huge house at its center . ProtagonistA had been living there for several months , and ProtagonistA loved it . ProtagonistA loved the peace and quiet of the Park , and ProtagonistA loved the company of ProtagonistB . One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the Park when ProtagonistA came across a small , abandoned house . It was in a state of disrepair , and it looked like it had been abandoned for years . ProtagonistA was curious , so ProtagonistA went inside . The house was dusty and musty , and it was clear that no one had been inside for a long time .

ProtagonistA was a bright young boy , but ProtagonistA was always a little bit different from the other kids at school . ProtagonistA had bright red hair , and bright blue eyes , and ProtagonistA always seemed to be looking at the world in a different way .

.
ProtagonistA had been sleeping all that time and was still sleeping when ProtagonistA began to cry . It was a deep , guttural cry that shook ProtagonistA's entire body . The sound was so loud and so unexpected that it woke ProtagonistB up from ProtagonistB's own sleep . ProtagonistB sat up in bed and looked at ProtagonistA .

ProtagonistA felt a pang of jealousy as ProtagonistA watched the two of them drive off together . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA should be happy for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit left out . ProtagonistA went back inside the house and sat down at the kitchen table . ProtagonistA was lost in thought when ProtagonistA heard a car pull up outside . ProtagonistA got up to see who it was and was surprised to see ProtagonistB getting out of the car . I forgot ProtagonistB's wallet ,  ProtagonistB said sheepishly . That 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said , trying to hide the relief in ProtagonistA's voice . I'm sorry I left ProtagonistA alone ,  ProtagonistB said .  Do ProtagonistA want to come into town with us?No , that 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA 'll just stay here . Are ProtagonistA sure ?  ProtagonistB asked .

ProtagonistA had always wanted a man with blond hair , but when ProtagonistA was eight the first color on ProtagonistA's face changed into something untidy and unpleasant . When ProtagonistA was sixteen , the second color started to change , and by the time ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA's hair was an entirely different color .

.
ProtagonistA was called ' calypso , ' and was carried away in the arms of ProtagonistA's mother , who , however , was not exactly like an angel ; but perhaps like a god , the same kind of god , as the sun and the moon and the stars and the whole galaxy .

ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head and sighed .  It is a shame , such a shame . ProtagonistA was a good man , ProtagonistA was . A kind man . ProtagonistA would have made a good husband , ProtagonistB think . The old woman 's eyes grew distant and ProtagonistB began to speak softly , as if ProtagonistB were talking to ProtagonistB .  They say that when ProtagonistC was just a girl , ProtagonistC was very beautiful . All the young men in the empire wanted to marry ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistD would only allow ProtagonistC to marry a man who could bring ProtagonistD the head of a dragon .

A fair - faced , blue - eyed girl with a soft , slightly lisping voice , the daughter of a Brooklyn market girl and a remorseless explorer , who had short , spiky black hair and a small , round face , and was accustomed to be the last one to board the little white train at the west end of the Bronx , or at least to begin ProtagonistA's journey without any companion except ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB had been on the train for what felt like hours , though it was probably only minutes . ProtagonistB was the only passenger in the car , and the only person ProtagonistB had seen since boarding was ProtagonistC .

Over the last three years , when I have been able to visit the house where ProtagonistA fathomed ProtagonistA's dreams , ProtagonistA has changed little . The living room is still full of ProtagonistA's books , ProtagonistA's favorite chair by the window is still there , and ProtagonistA's ashes are still on the mantle . ProtagonistB , has kept everything the same , as if ProtagonistB is waiting for ProtagonistA to come back . I know ProtagonistB still misses ProtagonistA terribly . It was only three years ago that ProtagonistA passed away , but it feels like a lifetime . I remember the day ProtagonistA told me ProtagonistA's dreams . We were sitting in ProtagonistA's living room , and ProtagonistA was telling me about all the places ProtagonistA wanted to see and the things ProtagonistA wanted to do . ProtagonistA had this sparkle in ProtagonistA's eye , and I could tell ProtagonistA was truly passionate about life . I was so inspired by ProtagonistA . Now , every time I visit ProtagonistA's house , I feel like ProtagonistA is still there with me , living ProtagonistA's dreams . 
.
ProtagonistA's life changed the day ProtagonistB died . It was an accident , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like it was ProtagonistA's fault . ProtagonistB had always been the more impulsive one , but ProtagonistA had always been the one to hold ProtagonistB back . If only ProtagonistA had let ProtagonistB go , ProtagonistB might still be alive . ProtagonistA was inconsolable after the funeral . ProtagonistA blamed ProtagonistA for ProtagonistB's death and felt like ProtagonistA did n't deserve to live . ProtagonistA was tempted to end ProtagonistA's own life , but something stopped ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that ProtagonistB was still with ProtagonistA , somehow . As the days went by , ProtagonistA started to notice strange things happening . ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistA in places ProtagonistA did n't remember going to , and ProtagonistA had strange dreams . In one dream , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was now immortal . At first , ProtagonistA thought it was just ProtagonistA's mind playing tricks on ProtagonistA , but the more ProtagonistA thought about it , the more ProtagonistA realized it was true . ProtagonistA was terrified at first , but ProtagonistA slowly started to accept ProtagonistA's new reality . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't tell anyone about it , because they would never believe ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA had to be careful , because if ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA would stay dead . ProtagonistA started to live ProtagonistA's life differently after that . ProtagonistA was more careful and deliberate in everything ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA also started to appreciate life more , because ProtagonistA knew how precious it was . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to make the most of ProtagonistA's time , because ProtagonistA now had eternity . 
.
The court papers in the office of ProtagonistA , dated May 6 , 1795 , showed that ProtagonistB , had put the cookery of ProtagonistA on ice , in order to prevent any further vanity . ProtagonistA was a simple man , and ProtagonistA did n't understand why ProtagonistB would do such a thing . ProtagonistA had always been a good cook , and ProtagonistA had never done anything to deserve this . ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's palace , and ProtagonistA begged ProtagonistB to lift the ban on ProtagonistA's cookery . ProtagonistB was a cold woman , and ProtagonistB refused . ProtagonistA pleaded with ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB would not listen . ProtagonistA went home , and ProtagonistA was heartbroken . ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do . ProtagonistA loved cooking , and it was ProtagonistA's passion . Without it , ProtagonistA felt lost . ProtagonistA decided to take matters into ProtagonistA's own hands . ProtagonistA snuck into ProtagonistB's palace kitchen and ProtagonistA cooked a meal . It was a beautiful meal , and it was perfect . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be impressed . The next day , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's office , and ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB the meal ProtagonistA had cooked . ProtagonistB was shocked . ProtagonistB had never seen such a beautiful meal . ProtagonistB lifted the ban on ProtagonistA's cookery , and ProtagonistB apologized for ever doubting ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a great cook , and ProtagonistA went on to have a successful career . ProtagonistA was loved by all , and ProtagonistA was always remembered for ProtagonistA's delicious food . 
.
ProtagonistA was walking towards the door of ProtagonistB's room , shaking ProtagonistA's head . It had been a long day , and ProtagonistA was just ready to relax . But as ProtagonistA got closer to the door , ProtagonistA could hear voices coming from inside . It sounded like ProtagonistB was on the phone , and ProtagonistB was crying . ProtagonistA paused for a moment , not sure what to do . Should ProtagonistA just go in and comfort ProtagonistB ? Or give ProtagonistB some space ? ProtagonistA decided to go in . As ProtagonistA walked in , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on the bed , phone in hand . ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with tears in ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistA sat down next to ProtagonistB and put ProtagonistA's arm around ProtagonistB .  It 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm here for ProtagonistB .  
.
ProtagonistA stood there , though ProtagonistA was not quite sure why . The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was going to bed , but now ProtagonistA was in some sort of strange room . The walls were made of stone , and there was a small window high up that let in a sliver of light . ProtagonistA could hear a faint noise coming from somewhere , and ProtagonistA started to walk towards it . As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that the noise was someone crying . ProtagonistA came to a door and slowly opened it . Inside was ProtagonistB , huddled in a corner . ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with terror in ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA had gotten here , or where here even was . But ProtagonistA did know that ProtagonistA could n't just leave ProtagonistB here by ProtagonistB . So ProtagonistA sat down and tried to comfort ProtagonistB the best ProtagonistA could . 
.
In the year of 1358 , during the reign of ProtagonistB , was born ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was born into a poor family and never had much growing up . When ProtagonistA was old enough , ProtagonistA started working in the fields to help support ProtagonistA's family . ProtagonistA worked hard every day , rain or shine .

ProtagonistA was so excited and could n't believe it was happening . ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things and went to the palace to start ProtagonistA's new life . 
.
It was a pity to see ProtagonistA's head , ProtagonistB , all throbbing and squirmy , ProtagonistA's eyes so half - closed , said ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's sweetest voice .  ProtagonistB 'm so sorry , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said ,  but ProtagonistB just ca n't help it . It 's been like this for days , and the doctors do n't know what to do . They say it 's some sort of infection , but they ca n't seem to get rid of it .  ProtagonistA just nodded , too exhausted to speak . ProtagonistA had been in and out of the hospital for weeks , and it was taking its toll on ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA 'll be all right ,  ProtagonistA said finally .  ProtagonistA just need some rest .  And with that , ProtagonistA turned over and went to sleep . 
.
In truth , for all the things ProtagonistA had , no one expected ProtagonistA to be a mother . It was a hot summer day and ProtagonistA was out in the yard , tending to ProtagonistA's garden . ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the bushes and went to investigate . There , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB , meowing pitifully . ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB in and nursed ProtagonistB back to health . ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB's Mittens and ProtagonistB became ProtagonistA's best friend . Over the years , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB grew old together . When ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistA was heartbroken . ProtagonistA never expected to love ProtagonistB so much , but ProtagonistB was the best thing that ever happened to ProtagonistA . 
.
ProtagonistA was four years old when ProtagonistA heard the news that ProtagonistC had been murdered . It was a cold winter day and ProtagonistA was inside playing with ProtagonistA's toys . ProtagonistB was in the kitchen cooking dinner when the doorbell rang . ProtagonistB answered the door and ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB talking to someone in a low voice . ProtagonistA could n't hear what they were saying , but ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was upset . After a few minutes , ProtagonistB came into the living room and sat down next to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC had been killed and that ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistC again . ProtagonistA was very sad and cried for a long time . 
.
ProtagonistB partook of ProtagonistA's tea , an infusion of which was prepared for ProtagonistA by the hand of the cook of the kitchen . It was a most delicious tea , and ProtagonistB was quite pleased with it . ProtagonistA , however , seemed to be in a hurry and did not drink more than a few sips before setting ProtagonistA's cup down and getting up from the table .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA must be going now ,  ProtagonistA said .  It was nice to meet ProtagonistB .  And with that , ProtagonistA was gone . 
.
ProtagonistA's head was pounding as ProtagonistA slowly opened ProtagonistA's eyes . The first words ProtagonistA heard were ,  ProtagonistB is dead .  ProtagonistA could n't believe it . ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's best friend . They had been through everything together . ProtagonistA tried to get up , but ProtagonistA felt so weak . ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was in a hospital room . ProtagonistA must have been in a coma . The doctors said that ProtagonistA would n't be able to speak or move ever again . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA wanted to cry , but ProtagonistA could n't even do that . The only thing ProtagonistA could do was think about ProtagonistB . 
.
The first time ProtagonistB pulled ProtagonistA out of the park , ProtagonistA was in a tangle of newts , ProtagonistA's body in full view of the other newts . ProtagonistA was a mess , ProtagonistA's scales all over the place , and ProtagonistA's eyes were bulging out of ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB had to act fast . ProtagonistB grabbed ProtagonistA by the tail and yanked ProtagonistA out of the park . The other newts hissed and retreated back into the undergrowth . ProtagonistB laid ProtagonistA down on the ground and tried to untangle ProtagonistA . After a few minutes , ProtagonistB managed to get ProtagonistA's body back into some semblance of order . ProtagonistA was still alive , but ProtagonistA was in a bad way . ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB had to get ProtagonistA to a hospital . ProtagonistB picked ProtagonistA up and started to run . 
.
The first time ProtagonistB met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was eleven years old . ProtagonistA was a new student at ProtagonistB's school , and ProtagonistB was assigned to show ProtagonistA around . From the start , ProtagonistB could tell that ProtagonistA was different . ProtagonistA was quiet and shy , and ProtagonistA did n't seem to fit in with the other kids . But ProtagonistB liked ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB was determined to help ProtagonistA make friends . Over the next few weeks , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA under ProtagonistB's wing . ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA around the school , introduced ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's friends , and helped ProtagonistA feel more comfortable . ProtagonistA slowly started to open up , and before long , ProtagonistA was just another member of ProtagonistB's group of friends . ProtagonistB was happy that ProtagonistB could help ProtagonistA feel welcome and accepted . It was the first time ProtagonistB realized that ProtagonistB had a talent for making friends and helping others feel comfortable in new situations . It was a skill that would serve ProtagonistB well throughout ProtagonistB's life . 
.
ProtagonistB stood before ProtagonistA , and the breath was stilled before ProtagonistA . They had been friends since kindergarden , but now they were on opposite sides . ProtagonistB was a good man , a family man , and ProtagonistB had always been there for ProtagonistA . But now , ProtagonistA had to take ProtagonistB down . ProtagonistA was the only one who could . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and steadied ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had to do this . It was the only way . ProtagonistA raised ProtagonistA's gun and aimed . ProtagonistB's eyes widened in shock , but ProtagonistB did n't say anything . ProtagonistB just stood there . And then ProtagonistA pulled the trigger . 
.
ProtagonistA had seen death before . ProtagonistA had seen it in the eyes of ProtagonistA's patients , in their final moments . ProtagonistA knew the look of a person who was about to die . But ProtagonistA had never seen it in the eyes of someone so young . Fourteen years ago , when ProtagonistA was conducting ProtagonistA's last examination of ProtagonistA's patients , ProtagonistA had an idea of what might befall ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be consumed by fear , that ProtagonistB would be tortured by the thought of ProtagonistB's own mortality . And so it was that ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA sitting in ProtagonistB's room , watching as ProtagonistB writhed in pain , ProtagonistB's eyes wide with terror . ProtagonistA knew that there was nothing ProtagonistA could do to ease ProtagonistB's suffering , but ProtagonistA stayed with ProtagonistB anyway , until the end . ProtagonistB's death was a tragedy , but it was also a wake - up call for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA needed to find a way to help people come to terms with their own mortality . And so ProtagonistA started a support group for people who were afraid of death . The group has been a success , and ProtagonistA has helped many people come to terms with their own mortality . ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistB's death was not in vain , and that ProtagonistB's legacy will live on through the people ProtagonistA has helped . 
.
ProtagonistA was a kindly old man who loved to help others . So when ProtagonistA saw the state of the flat , ProtagonistA was appalled . The poor tenants were living in squalor , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to help . ProtagonistA knocked on the door and was let in by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA around the flat , and ProtagonistA was shocked by what ProtagonistA saw . The place was a mess , and the tenants were clearly struggling . ProtagonistA offered to help them clean up the place and to get them some food and supplies . The tenants were grateful , and soon the flat was looking much better . ProtagonistA continued to help the tenants , and ProtagonistA soon became a good friend to them . ProtagonistA was always there for them when they needed help , and ProtagonistA was proud to have made a difference in their lives .

There was once ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was a small town in the middle of nowhere . The only thing that was in ProtagonistA was a gas station and a grocery store . ProtagonistB's family was the only family who lived in ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB's mom worked at the gas station and ProtagonistB's dad worked at the grocery store . ProtagonistB went to school online because there was no school in ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was bored out of ProtagonistB's mind living in ProtagonistA . The only thing ProtagonistB had to do was go outside and explore . ProtagonistB would explore ProtagonistA and the surrounding area . ProtagonistB would find new things to do everyday to keep ProtagonistB entertained . One day , ProtagonistB found a cave that nobody knew about . ProtagonistB explored the cave and found a secret room that nobody else knew about . ProtagonistB was excited to have found something new .

ProtagonistA was a very pretty girl , with dark hair which fell to ProtagonistA's shoulders , a light complexion , strong eyebrows and a shining face . ProtagonistA had been brought up in a small village and had never seen anything like the big city . ProtagonistA was very excited to be there and to see all the sights . The first thing ProtagonistA did was to go to the park . ProtagonistA sat on a bench and watched the people go by . ProtagonistA saw a lot of pretty girls , but none as pretty as ProtagonistA . After a while , ProtagonistA got up and walked around . ProtagonistA looked in shop windows and at the people in the street . ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do next . ProtagonistA walked around for a while longer , and then ProtagonistA saw a sign for a museum . ProtagonistA had never been to a museum before , so ProtagonistA decided to go in . ProtagonistA looked at all the paintings and the sculptures . ProtagonistA was so fascinated by everything that ProtagonistA forgot to look at the time . When ProtagonistA finally came out , it was getting dark . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was . ProtagonistA was lost . ProtagonistA started to panic , but then ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA went up to ProtagonistB and asked for help . ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA ProtagonistA's name and where ProtagonistA lived .

The boy in the striped tunic , who had looked almost exactly like a man , when ProtagonistA was five inches long , and five inches tall , and had fair hair , looked exactly like Bob , and in fact looked a great deal like a woman , at the time of ProtagonistA's first conception . ProtagonistB had been very beautiful , and very young , and ProtagonistB had died when ProtagonistA was only a few days old . ProtagonistC had been a very old man , and ProtagonistC had died when ProtagonistA was two years old .

When ProtagonistA was five years old , ProtagonistA's grandfather had died , and ProtagonistA's grandmother had died when ProtagonistA was seven . ProtagonistA had been sent to live in an orphanage then , and ProtagonistA had never seen ProtagonistA's grandparents ' house again . 
.
ProtagonistA was going to have to kill ProtagonistB . It was nothing personal , ProtagonistA just could n't have ProtagonistB around anymore . ProtagonistB had become a liability and ProtagonistA could n't take that risk . ProtagonistA sat down on the arm of the chair , looking into ProtagonistB's eyes .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  But ProtagonistA have to do this . ProtagonistA reached for the knife on the table and plunged it into ProtagonistB's chest . ProtagonistB gasped and ProtagonistA felt a pang of regret , but ProtagonistA knew it had to be done . ProtagonistA cleaned up the mess and disposed of the body . It was a shame , really . ProtagonistB had been a good kid . But sometimes , tough decisions had to be made . 
.
ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's early twenty - first year , had , in fact , the least to do , of all ProtagonistB's ladies of ProtagonistA's age , in the establishment of a palace for them at the point where the river Styx flows into the Thrym - yard . ProtagonistA had been sent there by the Queen with a small retinue of servants and a few handmaidens to help set up the household . The place was already prepared for them , with a large house and outbuildings , a garden , and a stable . The Queen had told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was to be the head of the household and that ProtagonistA's first task was to find a suitable husband for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA set about ProtagonistA's task with a will , and within a few weeks had found ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was a bit older than ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistC would be a good match for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistC's name was John , and ProtagonistC was the son of a lord . ProtagonistC was a bit shy , but ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistC would be good for ProtagonistB . The wedding was a grand affair , and all of ProtagonistB's ladies were in attendance . ProtagonistA had done ProtagonistA's duty , and ProtagonistA was happy to see ProtagonistB so well - matched . After the wedding , ProtagonistA continued to run the household for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistA was content in ProtagonistA's work . 
.
ProtagonistA was born and ProtagonistA was a boy , but ProtagonistA looked as if ProtagonistA had been shot . ProtagonistB was horrified when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's father was angry . The doctors said that there was nothing wrong with ProtagonistA and that ProtagonistA would be fine , but ProtagonistA's parents did n't believe them . They took ProtagonistA to a specialist who said that ProtagonistA had a rare condition that caused ProtagonistA to look like ProtagonistA had been shot . ProtagonistA's parents were relieved and they decided to keep ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA grew up to be a normal boy , but ProtagonistA always had a special place in ProtagonistA's heart for ProtagonistA's parents who loved ProtagonistA no matter what . 
.
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB lived in a small cove along the southern shore of an old lake . ProtagonistA always carried around the memory of the time when ProtagonistB had cheated on ProtagonistA . It was a very sordid and infamous memory that ProtagonistA held onto . ProtagonistB always felt guilty about what ProtagonistB had done and tried to make it up to ProtagonistA in any way ProtagonistB could . One day , while they were out fishing in their boat , ProtagonistB had a heart attack and died . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistB all over again . 
.
One day ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's home town to go to boarding school . All the while ProtagonistA had a secret which ProtagonistB was in search of . The secret was that ProtagonistA could turn invisible at will . ProtagonistA had never told anyone about this ability , not even ProtagonistA's parents , for fear of being considered a freak . But ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the idea of being able to disappear and go anywhere ProtagonistA wanted without being seen . The first few days at boarding school were tough for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was shy and withdrawn and missed ProtagonistA's family and home terribly . But ProtagonistA soon made some friends and settled into a routine . One day , while ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends were exploring the school grounds , they came across ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was muttering to ProtagonistB and seemed to be in a world of ProtagonistB's own . ProtagonistA's friends were scared and wanted to run away , but ProtagonistA felt sorry for ProtagonistB and decided to help ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB was looking for . ProtagonistB replied that ProtagonistB was looking for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's heart skipped a beat . Could ProtagonistB somehow know about ProtagonistA's secret ability?The man went on to say that ProtagonistB had been searching for years for someone with this ability , as ProtagonistB believed that they could help ProtagonistB with a very important mission . ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA would be willing to help ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but then ProtagonistA thought about how exciting it would be to use ProtagonistA's power to help someone . ProtagonistA agreed to help ProtagonistB , and they set off on their adventure . 
.
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's cousin were having lunch at the upper end of the city . They were both enjoying their meal when they heard a commotion coming from the lower end of the city . They both got up to see what was going on and saw a group of people running towards them . ProtagonistA's cousin said that they should go see what was going on , but ProtagonistA was hesitant . ProtagonistA did n't want to get involved in whatever was going on . But ProtagonistA's cousin was insistent and eventually ProtagonistA relented . They made their way down to the lower end of the city and saw that a group of people were attacking ProtagonistB . They were beating ProtagonistB and kicking ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA's cousin ran towards ProtagonistB to help ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA stayed back . ProtagonistA did n't want to get involved . But ProtagonistA's cousin was able to help ProtagonistB and eventually the attackers ran off . ProtagonistB was badly injured and ProtagonistA's cousin stayed with ProtagonistB to help ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA just stood there , feeling like a coward . ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA's cousin had helped ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA wished that ProtagonistA had been brave enough to do it ProtagonistA . 
.
Ever since the dark nights of the past , when ProtagonistA had been orphan and immature , and brought to the surface of madness by the combination of innocence with evil , the beautiful , innocent face of ProtagonistA , had been a source of terror to ProtagonistB , and perhaps to ProtagonistA , and one of the most uncertain and troublesome situations of childhood . It was during these dark nights that ProtagonistB would find ProtagonistA in the kitchen , eating whatever ProtagonistA could find , or in ProtagonistA's room , tearing at ProtagonistA's clothes and hair . ProtagonistB would try to talk to ProtagonistA , to reason with ProtagonistA , but it was as if ProtagonistA could n't hear ProtagonistB . As if ProtagonistA was a different person altogether . It was during one of these dark nights that ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA in the kitchen , ProtagonistA's face covered in blood . ProtagonistB screamed when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA turned to look at ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's green eyes . ProtagonistB could see the madness in them , and ProtagonistB knew that there was nothing ProtagonistB could do to help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB turned and ran from the kitchen , and ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB could hear ProtagonistA's footsteps behind ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was going to kill ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB ran into ProtagonistB's bedroom and locked the door , but ProtagonistA was already inside . ProtagonistA grabbed ProtagonistB and started to strangle ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB fought against ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB was no match for ProtagonistA's strength . ProtagonistB could feel ProtagonistB's life slipping away , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB was going to die . Suddenly , ProtagonistA stopped strangling ProtagonistB and looked at ProtagonistB with a confused expression on ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA let ProtagonistB go and ProtagonistB fell to the floor , gasping for breath . ProtagonistA just stood there , looking at ProtagonistB , and then ProtagonistA turned and walked out of the room . ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistA go downstairs and out the front door . ProtagonistB lay there for a moment , trying to catch ProtagonistB's breath , and then ProtagonistB got up and ran to the window . ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA walking down the street , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was going to kill again . 
.
ProtagonistB had not expected to find ProtagonistA dead . ProtagonistB had been out for a walk in the woods when ProtagonistB came across ProtagonistA's body . ProtagonistA was lying on the ground , ProtagonistA's eyes open and staring up at the sky . There was a large pool of blood around ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistB did not know what to do . ProtagonistB stood there for a moment , unsure of what to do . Then ProtagonistB turned and ran back the way ProtagonistB had come . ProtagonistB did not want to be the one who found the body of ProtagonistA . 
.
ProtagonistA had been debating all day whether ProtagonistA wanted to go to the country inn or ProtagonistB's house . ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA went to the inn , ProtagonistA would most likely die in the cold and damp . However , ProtagonistA was not sure if it was worth it to go to ProtagonistB's house and die in the heat . In the end , ProtagonistA decided to go to ProtagonistB's house . When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistB had already passed away . ProtagonistA died shortly after from the heat . 
.
ProtagonistA had once left a large sum of money and ProtagonistA's house in London for the purpose of making a new life for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had wanted a man who would be faithful to ProtagonistA in the world . ProtagonistA had met many men who had promised to be faithful , but they had all eventually betrayed ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had almost given up hope of finding someone who would truly love ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was everything ProtagonistA had ever wanted in a man and more . ProtagonistB was kind , gentle , and loving , and ProtagonistB promised to always be faithful to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA believed ProtagonistB and they began a life together . For several years , everything was perfect between them . ProtagonistA was happier than ProtagonistA had ever been and ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistB was the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA . However , one day ProtagonistA came home and found ProtagonistB in bed with another man . ProtagonistA was heartbroken and devastated . ProtagonistA could n't believe that ProtagonistB had betrayed ProtagonistA after everything they had been through together . ProtagonistA left ProtagonistB and never looked back . ProtagonistA vowed to never trust another man again .

ProtagonistA was a mother 's lady and ProtagonistB was the nicest girl in the world . ProtagonistB always had a smile on ProtagonistB's face and was always willing to help others . ProtagonistA was very proud of ProtagonistB and loved ProtagonistB very much . One day , when ProtagonistB was out playing with ProtagonistB's friends , ProtagonistB was hit by a car and killed . ProtagonistA was devastated . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to go on without ProtagonistB . But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be strong for ProtagonistA's wife and other daughter . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would want ProtagonistA to be happy and to keep living . So that 's what ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA lived for ProtagonistB and tried to make the best of every day . 
.
The night ProtagonistA vanished was the night when ProtagonistA shared ProtagonistA's bed with ProtagonistB . It was also the night when ProtagonistB vanished . ProtagonistA had always been a bit odd , and ProtagonistB was the only one who ever really understood ProtagonistA . That 's why ProtagonistB did n't hesitate when ProtagonistA asked if ProtagonistB could share ProtagonistB's bed . But when ProtagonistB woke up the next morning , ProtagonistA was gone . There was no trace of ProtagonistA anywhere . ProtagonistB searched for ProtagonistA for weeks , but ProtagonistA was never seen again . Some people say that ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB both vanished into thin air . Others say that they were abducted by aliens . But no one knows for sure what happened to them . 
.
The last time they saw each other , ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's seventh year . ProtagonistA was getting ready to retire , and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's wife had decided to move to Florida . They had sold their house and most of their belongings , and were planning to live off of ProtagonistA's pension . ProtagonistA's wife had died a few years before , and ProtagonistA was looking forward to finally being able to relax and enjoy ProtagonistA's retirement . ProtagonistA had stayed in touch with some of ProtagonistA's old friends from work , but ProtagonistA had n't seen them in years . When ProtagonistA got the call that ProtagonistB had died , ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB in years , but ProtagonistA had always thought of ProtagonistB fondly . ProtagonistA decided to go to ProtagonistB's funeral , and ProtagonistA was surprised to see how many people had turned out . ProtagonistA was even more surprised when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was all grown up now , and ProtagonistC was beautiful . They hugged each other and cried , and ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had come to the funeral . It was the last time they saw each other . 
.
On Tuesday , Mr. Bligh came to me at home with the news that ProtagonistA had been admitted into the College of the Holy - McPherson Priory , and that it would be five years before ProtagonistA would be able to see ProtagonistB . I was so excited for ProtagonistA and could n't wait to tell ProtagonistB the good news . I knew ProtagonistB would be just as excited as I was . 
.
ProtagonistA had always been a bright boy . So when ProtagonistA was admitted into the College of the Holy McPherson Priory , ProtagonistB was not surprised . But ProtagonistB was disappointed that ProtagonistB would not be able to see ProtagonistA for five years . Mr . Bligh had come to ProtagonistB with the news , and ProtagonistB was grateful to him for keeping ProtagonistB informed . But ProtagonistB could not help feeling a little sad . ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's only nephew , and ProtagonistB had always been close to ProtagonistA . Now ProtagonistB would have to wait five years to see ProtagonistA again . But ProtagonistB was happy for ProtagonistA , and knew that ProtagonistA would do great things at the college . 
.
Alive , eight days after the death of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA sat down to choose a subject of conversation with ProtagonistA's neighbour - the world 's most eminent apothecary , Doctor Joseph Vane - the world 's greatest chocolate connoisseur of the nineteenth century , Mr. Belvedere of the Parisian street fly- and - supplies , Dr. John Quartermaster - of the ship - whale Squadron Heterozone of the Navy - and indeed the world - famous spectacles - in - the - air , as ProtagonistA was giving the order of concealment to ProtagonistA's revolver and was about to read out the returning message of a dramatic undertone , which the man in question had written for her:-I am coming to murder you ! Go away , madman ! ' as the prompt . The doorbell rang . Bob , who had been expecting the arrival of the postman , got up to answer it . When ProtagonistA opened the door , ProtagonistA was shocked to see ProtagonistB's murderer standing there . Without a word , the man raised his revolver and shot ProtagonistA in the head . As ProtagonistA lay dying on the floor , ProtagonistA's last thoughts were of ProtagonistB and how much ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistA had been walking home from work , minding ProtagonistA's own business , when ProtagonistA ran into ProtagonistB . It was literally the worst day of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistB was a big , burly man , and ProtagonistB was in a bad mood . ProtagonistB started shouting at ProtagonistA , and before ProtagonistA knew it , ProtagonistA was in a full - blown fight with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB punched ProtagonistA in the face , and ProtagonistA went down hard . ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA was going to die . But then , something miraculous happened . ProtagonistB stopped punching ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's feet . ProtagonistB apologized for losing ProtagonistB's temper , and ProtagonistB even offered to buy ProtagonistA a drink . ProtagonistA was stunned . ProtagonistA had never expected ProtagonistB to be anything other than a violent thug . But from that day forward , the two men became friends . They would often meet up for a drink after work , and they would talk about their lives . ProtagonistA was happy to have found a friend in ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was grateful that their first meeting had n't ended in tragedy . 
.
ProtagonistA was going to stop calling ProtagonistB  ProtagonistD ,  said ProtagonistC , though ProtagonistA did not know at the time what ProtagonistA called ProtagonistA , or what ProtagonistA regarded as ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB had always been a bit of an oddball , and ProtagonistC had always been a bit of a traditionalist . ProtagonistC did n't approve of ProtagonistB's eccentricities and ProtagonistC certainly did n't approve of ProtagonistB calling ProtagonistA  Madam .  But ProtagonistA liked ProtagonistB , despite ProtagonistB's quirks , and ProtagonistA did n't see any reason to stop calling ProtagonistB by ProtagonistD . One day , ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA continued to call ProtagonistB  Madam .  ProtagonistA thought for a moment and then explained that ProtagonistB was just different from everyone else and that ProtagonistA liked ProtagonistB for that . ProtagonistC was taken aback by ProtagonistA's response and ProtagonistC realized that ProtagonistC had been wrong about ProtagonistB all along . From then on , ProtagonistC started to see ProtagonistB in a different light and ProtagonistC even began to call ProtagonistB  Madam  ProtagonistC . 
.
ProtagonistA flung open the white door of ProtagonistA's kitchen and directed ProtagonistB to the dining room . ProtagonistB , hesitated for a moment before following ProtagonistA's lead . ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB to a seat at the table and then went back to the kitchen to finish preparing dinner . ProtagonistB sat at the table , not quite sure what to do . ProtagonistB looked around the room , taking in the pictures on the walls and the knick - knacks on the shelves . After a few minutes , ProtagonistA came back into the room carrying a tray of food . ProtagonistA set it down in front of ProtagonistB and then took a seat across from ProtagonistB . The two men ate in silence . ProtagonistA was content to let ProtagonistB eat ProtagonistB's fill before ProtagonistA started asking questions . ProtagonistB , however , was not used to being silent and soon started to chatter away . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life , ProtagonistB's job , ProtagonistB's family . ProtagonistA listened patiently , only interjecting to ask the occasional question . When ProtagonistB was done eating , ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's company and showed ProtagonistB to the door . ProtagonistB was clearly reluctant to leave , but ProtagonistA was adamant . ProtagonistA said goodbye and watched as ProtagonistB walked down the path to the street . ProtagonistA went back inside and returned to the kitchen . ProtagonistA was content to have made a new friend , even if it was a bit unusual . 
.
ProtagonistA was a stranger , and a stranger that ProtagonistA was , if ProtagonistA had been anything like any other woman of flesh or blood . ProtagonistA came to ProtagonistB's door one day , seeking shelter from the rain . ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA in , and they talked long into the night . ProtagonistB learned that ProtagonistA was a wanderer , and that ProtagonistA had no home to go to . ProtagonistB offered ProtagonistA a place to stay , and ProtagonistA accepted . They became friends , and eventually lovers . But one day , ProtagonistA disappeared , and ProtagonistB never saw ProtagonistA again . ProtagonistB always wondered what happened to ProtagonistA , and if ProtagonistA ever thought of ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had only been married for three months when ProtagonistA died unexpectedly at ProtagonistA's home in Newton . The cause of death was complications from pregnancy . ProtagonistB was devastated . ProtagonistB was pregnant with their first child and had been looking forward to starting a family with ProtagonistA . Now ProtagonistB was left alone , with no husband and no child . ProtagonistB was heartbroken . ProtagonistA's death was a shock to everyone . ProtagonistA was only in ProtagonistA's early 30s and was in good health . ProtagonistA's death was a tragedy and ProtagonistB was never able to get over it . 
.
ProtagonistA was sixteen and in love , and ProtagonistA was going to have to kill someone . ProtagonistA had never wanted to hurt anyone , but ProtagonistA's love for ProtagonistB was so strong that ProtagonistA would do anything for ProtagonistB . Even if it meant taking a life . ProtagonistB was the daughter of a rival gang leader , and if ProtagonistA did n't kill ProtagonistB's father , ProtagonistB would be forced to marry someone else . ProtagonistA could n't let that happen . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB too much . So ProtagonistA steeled ProtagonistA for the task ahead , and on the night of the big gang showdown , ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB's father . It was the only way to save ProtagonistB . And ProtagonistA would do it again in a heartbeat , if it meant that ProtagonistB could be ProtagonistA .

ProtagonistA was a good and kind woman , and as such ProtagonistA would not have anything to do with a sick man . ProtagonistA was content to live ProtagonistA's life alone , without the hassle of caring for someone else . However , one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA could not turn away from ProtagonistB , and so ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB in and cared for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was very grateful , and ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA liked the feeling of helping someone in need . From then on , ProtagonistA made it ProtagonistA's mission to help as many sick people as ProtagonistA could . 
.
ProtagonistB had always been a bit odd , but ProtagonistA never really paid much attention to it . That is , until ProtagonistB started keeping rooks in their house . At first , ProtagonistA thought it was just a phase ProtagonistB was going through , but then ProtagonistB started getting more and more birds and started to neglect ProtagonistB's other hobbies . ProtagonistA tried to talk to ProtagonistB about it , but ProtagonistB just brushed ProtagonistA off , saying that it is what it is and that 's what ProtagonistB wants to do . Now , the house is full of birds and ProtagonistA ca n't stand it . ProtagonistA 's tried everything to get ProtagonistB to see reason , but ProtagonistB just wo n't listen . The birds are everywhere , in every room , and they 're starting to drive ProtagonistA crazy . ProtagonistA ca n't concentrate on anything with their constant squawking and ProtagonistA 's starting to feel like ProtagonistA 's going insane . One day , ProtagonistA snaps . ProtagonistA ca n't take it anymore and ProtagonistA starts yelling at ProtagonistB , telling ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB needs to get rid of the birds . ProtagonistB tries to calm ProtagonistA down , but it 's too late , ProtagonistA 's already worked ProtagonistA up into a frenzy . ProtagonistA starts throwing things , smashing the bird cages and freeing the birds . ProtagonistB tries to stop ProtagonistA , but it 's too late , the damage is done . ProtagonistA does n't know what to do now . ProtagonistA 's ruined everything and ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistB will never forgive ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 's destroyed ProtagonistB's hobby and ProtagonistB's life 's work and ProtagonistA ca n't take it back . ProtagonistA can only hope that someday ProtagonistB 'll be able to forgive ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA knows it will be a long time before that happens . 
.
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA 'd killed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA 'd been planning it for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA 'd found out about ProtagonistB's dark secret . ProtagonistA had always been a good person , but ProtagonistA could n't let ProtagonistB's evil continue . So ProtagonistA snuck into ProtagonistB's chambers one night and stabbed ProtagonistB in the heart . ProtagonistB gasped and fell to the ground , dead . ProtagonistA felt a surge of triumph as ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA 'd done the world a great service . But then ProtagonistB's body began to glow and ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA 'd made a mistake . ProtagonistB was not dead , but merely in a deep sleep . ProtagonistA had only killed ProtagonistB's physical body - the magic inside ProtagonistB was still alive and well . ProtagonistB's spirit appeared before ProtagonistA , looking angry and disappointed . ProtagonistA begged for forgiveness , but it was too late . The damage was done . ProtagonistB cast a spell on ProtagonistA , turning ProtagonistA into a toad . And then ProtagonistB disappeared , leaving ProtagonistA alone to suffer the consequences of ProtagonistA's actions . 
.
ProtagonistA was in the midst of the courtyard around ProtagonistA's apartment when ProtagonistA saw a rat dart by . ProtagonistA was so startled that ProtagonistA jumped up and ran back inside . ProtagonistA quickly told ProtagonistB what ProtagonistA had seen and ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would call the landlord . ProtagonistA was relieved that someone would take care of the problem . 
.
ProtagonistA was overjoyed when ProtagonistA's wife gave birth to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a beautiful baby girl . They named ProtagonistB's ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA decided to take the day off from work to spend time with ProtagonistA's new family . It was a great , wonderful day . 
.
The last night ProtagonistA had been on earth , ProtagonistA could n't believe it . ProtagonistB had a dream where ProtagonistB was just a girl and ProtagonistB was walking along in the garden , and suddenly a great wickedness smote ProtagonistB , and - now this is scary ! - and ProtagonistB was flying . In ProtagonistB's dream , ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA's body lying on the ground , and a great black bird was flying away . When ProtagonistB woke up , ProtagonistB was sweating and shaking . ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA had been killed , and ProtagonistB was the only one who could have done it . 
.
ProtagonistA rode ProtagonistA's yellow horse through the desert , looking for any sign of life . ProtagonistA had been riding for days , and was getting very tired . Finally , ProtagonistA came to a city where old walls and towers still stood . ProtagonistA rode through the city , and felt like something was watching ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA rode to the center of the city , and stopped . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was being watched , but ProtagonistA could n't see anyone . Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt something touch ProtagonistA's shoulder , and ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistB standing there . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was destined to be a great hero , and that ProtagonistA would save the world from a terrible fate . ProtagonistA was amazed , and did n't know what to say . ProtagonistB disappeared , and ProtagonistA was left alone in the city . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's destiny was to save the world , and ProtagonistA would do whatever it took to make sure that happened . 
.
ProtagonistA had been looking forward to ProtagonistB's visit all year . ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's only child , and ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was tall and lanky , with golden hair and tawny eyes . ProtagonistA pushed back ProtagonistB's heavy trunk and waded through the mud to the car . ProtagonistA was so excited to see ProtagonistB . Unfortunately , ProtagonistB was not excited to see ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB barely acknowledged ProtagonistA as ProtagonistB got out of the car and walked into the house . ProtagonistA's heart sank . ProtagonistA had been hoping for a warm reunion , but it was clear that ProtagonistB was not happy to be there . ProtagonistA tried to make the best of it , but it was clear that ProtagonistB was not interested in spending time with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB would go out with ProtagonistB's friends and come home late , barely speaking to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was hurt and disappointed , but ProtagonistA tried to understand . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was going through a tough time in ProtagonistB's life . One day , ProtagonistA came home and found ProtagonistB in the kitchen , crying . ProtagonistA sat down with ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what was wrong . ProtagonistB finally opened up to ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was struggling with ProtagonistB's mental health . ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA had had no idea . ProtagonistA listened as ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's struggles and ProtagonistB's fears . ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistB for being so brave and for opening up to ProtagonistA . They talked for hours , and ProtagonistA felt closer to ProtagonistB than ever before . Since that day , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB have been inseparable . They have a special bond that was forged through their shared experience . ProtagonistA is grateful that ProtagonistB came to visit , even though it was tough at first . ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistB is the most important person in ProtagonistA's life . 
.
To ProtagonistB is very nearly a treasure , and though it is not proper to discuss the disposition of ProtagonistA before ProtagonistA has attained to a certain age , I shall say that the owner of the house opposite to which I am now sitting , and of a certain age there never was a person who , till ProtagonistA had reached ProtagonistA's twenty - first birthday , could not plainly distinguish ProtagonistA – those persons were all strangers to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB , on the other hand , though ProtagonistB is not yet twenty - one , has known ProtagonistA for some years , and likes ProtagonistA very much . 
.
ProtagonistA am a man of thirty - nine years , and a thousand and one years ago at the beginning of the twelfth century ProtagonistA , appeared in the court of the first emperor Constantine , who was a God of the Jews , and ordered the execution of four hundred and fifty - two religious and political persons . This act created a great rift in the empire , and ProtagonistA was forced to flee . ProtagonistA eventually made ProtagonistA's way to the court of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a wise and just ruler , and ProtagonistB saw the value in ProtagonistA's knowledge and experience . ProtagonistB appointed ProtagonistA as ProtagonistB's chief advisor , and ProtagonistA served ProtagonistB faithfully for many years . When ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistA retired from public life and lived out ProtagonistA's days in peace . 
.
In those days there was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was a good , honest man , and a man of sense , and ProtagonistA knew what was good for ProtagonistA ; and ProtagonistA was called Adam , and ProtagonistA was wise . And ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB's name was Eve , and ProtagonistB was a good woman , and ProtagonistB was called Eve , because ProtagonistB was the mother of all living . And they had two children , and their names were Cain and Abel . And they were good children , and they loved their parents , and they were called Cain and Abel , because they were the first children of the world . And they were happy , and they loved each other , and they were good to each other , and they were called Cain and Abel , because they were the first children of the world . 
.
ProtagonistA was the very boss of all the soldiers , of the high school teachers , and even of the teachers ' wives . ProtagonistA had always said that the best way to get information out of ProtagonistB in the future was not to kill ProtagonistB , but to expose ProtagonistB , as ProtagonistB was known to the civilian world , to the light of ridicule . So when ProtagonistB was caught stealing a car , ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB paraded through the town square in a chicken suit . ProtagonistB was humiliated and laughed at by everyone who saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would never want to be exposed to that kind of ridicule again , and ProtagonistB would be more likely to cooperate in the future . 
.
Frank Wilson , an old friend and colleague of ProtagonistB's , once said ,  I am afraid , ProtagonistA , that when ProtagonistB is doing a little bit of necessary thing , you know all about it , and ProtagonistB 's got all sorts of things on ProtagonistB's conscience , but when ProtagonistB is doing all sorts of unnecessary thing , you never know what 's going on , you just know you 're used to it , and it 's when you 're doing a great deal of unnecessary thing that you really get into trouble .  
.
Siskais will not have noticed that the very day when ProtagonistA was to enrol in ProtagonistA's first year of school , ProtagonistB had ProtagonistA sent to the London School of Economics . It was only when ProtagonistB received a letter from the school informing ProtagonistB of ProtagonistA's admission that ProtagonistB realised what had happened . ProtagonistB was overjoyed that ProtagonistA would be able to get a good education and make something of ProtagonistA . 
.
ProtagonistA was a fourth year Muggleborn , and had , as such , come to the city of London on the last leg of ProtagonistA's journey from the Gringotts bank . ProtagonistA had been warned about the city , about the dangers that lurked in the shadows , but ProtagonistA had not been prepared for what ProtagonistA saw . The poverty , the filth , the crime . It was all too much . ProtagonistA was on the verge of turning around and going back to the safety of the bank when ProtagonistA heard a scream . It sounded like it was coming from an alleyway just off the main street . Without thinking , ProtagonistA ran towards the sound . As ProtagonistA turned into the alley , ProtagonistA saw a group of men surrounding ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was cowering in fear , and it was clear that ProtagonistB was in trouble . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA was just a fourth year student . ProtagonistA was n't a hero . But ProtagonistA had to do something . ProtagonistA stepped forward and spoke in a voice that ProtagonistA hoped was more confident than ProtagonistA felt .  Leave ProtagonistB alone . The men turned to look at ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA saw the hunger in their eyes . They were going to hurt ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA could n't let that happen . ProtagonistA reached into ProtagonistA's pocket and pulled out ProtagonistA's wand . ProtagonistA pointed it at the men and shouted ,  Stupefy!Nothing happened . The men laughed and advanced on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was in trouble now . There was no way that ProtagonistA could fight all of them off . But ProtagonistA had to try . ProtagonistA threw ProtagonistA at the nearest man , punching and kicking with all ProtagonistA's might . It was pointless . The man just brushed ProtagonistA aside and kept coming . ProtagonistA was knocked to the ground . ProtagonistA tried to get up , but ProtagonistA was too weak . The men were upon ProtagonistA now , kicking and punching ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA tried to fight back , but it was futile . Then , suddenly , they were gone . ProtagonistA looked up to see ProtagonistB standing over ProtagonistA , wand in hand . ProtagonistB had saved ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA tried to get up , but ProtagonistA's vision was swimming . ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB's voice , but ProtagonistA could n't make out the words . Then everything went black . 
.
Whatever ProtagonistA was , ProtagonistA was a brilliant boy . ProtagonistA had a knack for math and science , and ProtagonistA always seemed to be one step ahead of ProtagonistA's classmates . Even ProtagonistA's teachers were impressed with ProtagonistA's intellect . ProtagonistA was the type of boy who always had ProtagonistB's nose in a book , and ProtagonistB was always eager to learn more . One day , ProtagonistA's curiosity got the best of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA decided to ask ProtagonistC a question that had been bugging ProtagonistA for weeks .  ProtagonistC , why is the sky blue ?  ProtagonistC was taken aback by the question , but ProtagonistC quickly recovered and explained the science behind it . ProtagonistA nodded ProtagonistA's understanding , and the other students in the class began to ask their own questions . It was clear to everyone that ProtagonistA was a brilliant boy . 
.
The next day , after ProtagonistA had sent for the servants , ProtagonistA lay down on the front steps of the Black family house and watched as ProtagonistC poured cup after cup of tea for the household and the servants . It was a hot day and the sun was beating down on ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't mind . ProtagonistA was happy to be home . Suddenly , the front door opened and ProtagonistB came out . ProtagonistB was carrying a large suitcase and ProtagonistB looked very angry . What are ProtagonistA doing here ?  ProtagonistB demanded . ProtagonistA came home ,  ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistA ca n't just come home ! ProtagonistA have to go back to the city and get a ProtagonistB was about to say more , but ProtagonistC came out and put ProtagonistC's hand on ProtagonistB's arm . It 's all right , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistC said .  ProtagonistA can stay here with us . We 'll take care of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB hesitated for a moment , then nodded . All right ,  ProtagonistB said .  But ProtagonistA 's going to have to get a job soon . With that , ProtagonistB turned and walked back into the house . ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB go , then turned to ProtagonistC . Thank ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistA said . Don't worry , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said .  Everything will work out .  
.
In the midst of the streets of Alexandria , in the year 1659 , ProtagonistA , not unnaturally , but simply by habit , but the more naturally , since ProtagonistA was the son of it , took up ProtagonistA's residence in a large and commodious house in the very centre of the city , and there , like a good landlord , ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB's name was Mrs. Brown , and ProtagonistB was a very good woman , and ProtagonistB managed the house very well , and ProtagonistA was very well satisfied with ProtagonistB . But one day ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA and said to ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB am going to leave ProtagonistA .   What for , ProtagonistB ?  said ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB am going to get married , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB .  And who are ProtagonistB going to marry , ProtagonistB ?  said ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB am going to marry Mr. Jones , the baker ,  said ProtagonistB .  Very well , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistB will be happy .  
.
The air grew still as ProtagonistA entered the main door of the old office , but ProtagonistA was ready . ProtagonistA had been planning this for months and ProtagonistA was not going to let anything stop ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA walked calmly to the desk of ProtagonistB and pulled out a gun .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said ,  but ProtagonistA 'm going to have to ask ProtagonistB to leave .  ProtagonistB gasped and ran out of the room . ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB's footsteps echo down the hallway as ProtagonistB ran to get help . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA did n't have much time . ProtagonistA went to the first door on the left and opened it . Inside was a small office with a desk and a computer . ProtagonistA went to the desk and sat down in the chair . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be quick . ProtagonistA typed in the username and password that ProtagonistA had been given . Then ProtagonistA opened the file that ProtagonistA was looking for . ProtagonistA quickly scanned through it , looking for the information ProtagonistA needed . ProtagonistA found what ProtagonistA was looking for and copied it to a USB drive . Then ProtagonistA heard footsteps coming down the hallway . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to go . ProtagonistA put the USB drive in ProtagonistA's pocket and ran out of the room . ProtagonistA could hear the footsteps getting closer , but ProtagonistA did n't look back . ProtagonistA ran to the main door and opened it . Then ProtagonistA was outside . ProtagonistA ran down the street and did n't stop until ProtagonistA was safe . 
.
ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB . It was the same look ProtagonistB always gave when ProtagonistB managed to get one over on someone . In this case , it was the other kids in ProtagonistA's class . They had been teasing ProtagonistA all day about ProtagonistA's new shoes , saying they were too big for ProtagonistA and that ProtagonistA looked like a clown . But ProtagonistB had told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could wear them with pride , because they were the latest style and ProtagonistA was ahead of the trends . Now , as ProtagonistA watched the other kids ' jaws drop in envy , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB had been right . 
.
Barefoot lay by the side of ProtagonistB's house in the woods of Gower , where ProtagonistA had spent the good part of ProtagonistA's childhood , weeping heartily over ProtagonistB's death . ProtagonistA had loved ProtagonistB dearly , and ProtagonistB's passing had left a great hole in ProtagonistA's heart . The sun was setting , and the woods were beginning to fill with shadows . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should get up and go home , but ProtagonistA could n't bear to leave the spot where ProtagonistB had died . ProtagonistA lay there for a long time , until ProtagonistA finally fell into a fitful sleep . ProtagonistA was awakened by a rustling in the bushes . ProtagonistA sat up , heart pounding , and saw a large , furry creature standing in the clearing , looking at ProtagonistA with intelligent eyes . ProtagonistA froze , not knowing what to do . The creature took a step forward , and ProtagonistA scrambled to ProtagonistA's feet and ran as fast as ProtagonistA could back to ProtagonistB's house . ProtagonistA did n't stop running until ProtagonistA was safely inside , with the door bolted shut behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA never went back to that part of the woods again , but ProtagonistA always wondered what that creature had been . Was it a bear ? A wolf ? Or something else entirely ? ProtagonistA would never know for sure , but the experience had left ProtagonistA with a lifelong love of animals . 
.
ProtagonistA had a rough day . ProtagonistA lost ProtagonistA's wallet on ProtagonistA's way to work and had to borrow money from ProtagonistA's co - workers just to make it through the day . ProtagonistA was really looking forward to getting home , but when ProtagonistA got to the bus stop , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA did n't have enough money for the fare . ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . Just then , ProtagonistB approached ProtagonistA and asked if ProtagonistA needed help . ProtagonistA explained ProtagonistA's situation and ProtagonistB offered to give ProtagonistA a penny - a - penny lift home . ProtagonistA was so grateful and ProtagonistA promised to pay ProtagonistB back as soon as ProtagonistA could . ProtagonistB was true to ProtagonistB's word and ProtagonistA made it home safely . ProtagonistA was so thankful for ProtagonistB's help and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB's kindness . 
.
There were many things that ProtagonistA said that were not true , and some that ProtagonistA said that was not true , but there was one thing that ProtagonistA said or that ProtagonistA said or did or said or said that was true . It was true that ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB with all of ProtagonistA's heart . 
.
ProtagonistA had left home for the first time when ProtagonistA was thirteen . ProtagonistA had been excited to finally be out on ProtagonistA's own and to have some adventures . But , ProtagonistA quickly found out that ProtagonistB was possessed . This was a shock to ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA had always thought ProtagonistB was a good man . But , ProtagonistA soon realized that the possession had changed ProtagonistB and that ProtagonistB was now a danger to ProtagonistA and to others . ProtagonistA had to find a way to stop ProtagonistB and to save ProtagonistB from the possession . 
.
ProtagonistA glared at ProtagonistB , vigorously stirring the bowl of frosting . ProtagonistA had the foul look of the psychotic . It was clear that ProtagonistA was not going to let ProtagonistB ruin ProtagonistA's cake . ProtagonistA would not let ProtagonistB take away ProtagonistA's happiness . ProtagonistA had always loved baking . It was ProtagonistA's passion . ProtagonistA loved the way the batter came together , the way the cake rose in the oven , and the way the frosting turned out . ProtagonistA was always so proud of ProtagonistA's cakes . But lately , something had been off . ProtagonistA's cakes were still delicious , but they were n't quite the same . They were missing that special something that made them ProtagonistA's cakes . ProtagonistA had tried everything ProtagonistA could think of , but nothing worked . ProtagonistA had even asked ProtagonistB for help , but ProtagonistB had just laughed and told ProtagonistA to give up . But ProtagonistA was n't going to give up . ProtagonistA was going to find out what was wrong with ProtagonistA's cakes , and ProtagonistA was going to fix it . ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear ProtagonistB come up behind ProtagonistA . What are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked , ProtagonistB's voice dripping with disdain . ProtagonistA jumped , and the bowl of frosting toppled over . You idiot !  ProtagonistB shouted .  ProtagonistA 've ruined ProtagonistB's cake!Bob 's face turned red with anger . ProtagonistA had had enough of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was done with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA picked up the bowl of frosting and threw it at ProtagonistB , hitting ProtagonistB square in the face . You're lucky ProtagonistB do n't have a wand , because ProtagonistB would hex ProtagonistA into oblivion ,  ProtagonistB spat . ProtagonistB turned and stormed out of the kitchen , leaving ProtagonistA standing there , victorious . 
.
It was around eleven o'clock and it had been almost two months since ProtagonistB had died — three , in fact , if you include the time ProtagonistA 'd spent in temporary hospital and the time of great pain and suffering ProtagonistA 'd been through . ProtagonistA had been living with ProtagonistA's father since then , and though ProtagonistA was grateful for the support , ProtagonistA found the house to be incredibly lonely without ProtagonistB's presence . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB's cooking , ProtagonistB's laughter , and ProtagonistB's warm hugs . ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistB's old armchair , looking at old photos of ProtagonistB and trying to hold back the tears , when ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door . ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and was surprised to see ProtagonistC , standing on the doorstep . Hello , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said , smiling .  ProtagonistC hope ProtagonistA do n't mind ProtagonistC coming by , but ProtagonistC wanted to check on ProtagonistA and see how ProtagonistA 're doing . ProtagonistA invited ProtagonistC in , and they sat down in the living room and talked . It was so nice to have someone to talk to who understood what ProtagonistA was going through . ProtagonistC stayed for a cup of tea , and when ProtagonistC left , ProtagonistA felt just a little bit better . It was around eleven o'clock , and though it had been a tough few months , ProtagonistA was slowly starting to heal . 
.
After ProtagonistA was expelled from Hogwarts , ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA's life was over . ProtagonistA would never be as bright as ProtagonistA's father , and as bright as ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could be . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never find a place in the world where ProtagonistA belonged . But then ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a million miles away , but ProtagonistB was the one who showed ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could be anything ProtagonistA wanted to be . With ProtagonistB's help , ProtagonistA became an Auror , and ProtagonistA's mother became a million miles away . 
.
ProtagonistA's youth was spent following in ProtagonistA's brother 's footsteps . ProtagonistA was interested in the same things as ProtagonistA's brother and was happy to partake in any activities that ProtagonistA's brother enjoyed . This made ProtagonistA happy and content in ProtagonistA's youth , but as ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to yearn for something more . ProtagonistA wanted to find ProtagonistA's own interests and hobbies , but no matter how hard ProtagonistA tried , ProtagonistA could n't seem to break away from ProtagonistA's brother 's shadow . It was n't until ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA finally found the courage to forge ProtagonistA's own path . With ProtagonistB's support , ProtagonistA was finally able to break free from ProtagonistA's brother 's influence and become ProtagonistA's own person . 
.
ProtagonistA was back in the Kremlin , slinging hints at ProtagonistB and son while ProtagonistA sat in ProtagonistA's comfortable chair . ProtagonistA had been gone for weeks on a business trip and was now ready to relax . ProtagonistB , however , was not as pleased to see ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB had been dealing with the children and the household on ProtagonistB's own and was not in the mood to entertain ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was undeterred . ProtagonistA continued to make suggestive comments , hoping to get a rise out of ProtagonistB . Eventually , ProtagonistB had had enough . ProtagonistB stood up and told ProtagonistA to leave . ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA had never been treated like this before . ProtagonistA quickly gathered ProtagonistA's things and left , vowing never to return . 
.
ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA often . ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's everything . ProtagonistB's reason for living . And so it was with ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA's soft skin , ProtagonistA's gentle touch , and ProtagonistA's beautiful smile . ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA's smell , ProtagonistA's taste , and the way ProtagonistA made ProtagonistB feel . ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA's laugh , ProtagonistA's voice , and the way ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA's love , ProtagonistA's passion , and the way ProtagonistA made ProtagonistB feel alive . 
.
It is to the great credit of ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA is now living . The only fault on which ProtagonistA is minded is that ProtagonistA has not yet regained the capacity of an adult man , but for whom , owing to the inherent value of youth and to ProtagonistA's own congenital beauty , the balance of society naturally imposed on ProtagonistA a certain age of vigor and of mature intellectual development . ProtagonistA's parents had died when ProtagonistA was young , and ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistA's grandparents . When they died , ProtagonistA was left alone in the world . ProtagonistA had no education and no job skills . ProtagonistA drifted from one place to another , living on the streets and doing odd jobs to get by . One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a kind man who took ProtagonistA in and gave ProtagonistA a job . ProtagonistA worked hard and soon learned all ProtagonistA needed to know to be a successful adult . ProtagonistB was like a father to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was grateful for all that ProtagonistB had done for ProtagonistA . Thanks to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was now a productive member of society . 
.
ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head dismissively as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB drift into the station carriages . It was clear that ProtagonistB was lost and did n't know where ProtagonistB was going . But ProtagonistA was n't going to help ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had enough problems of ProtagonistA's own . 
.
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was suspicious of ProtagonistB because ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB was either a prostitute or an insane person . ProtagonistA did n't like either of them , so ProtagonistA walked away .

There was once an old farmer in Oxfordshire , now dead and gone , who had lived long enough to see the day when playthings had their proper uses — when industry , rather than mere wit , was the proper measure of man 's worth ; when the frivolous avocations of childish boys , once well nigh spent , had in their turn given place to the occupations which distinguished the most respectable members of society ; when the good sense of the courts of law had been fairly given due regard , so that many of those cases in which society had once regarded as frivolous or trivial — and this was for the most part , indeed , the case , in which the good sense of the law had not in any way sufficed , but which were , or at any rate were , fairly decided by an inexperienced judge , who was , or rather was , permitted to decide them , according to the rules of the game — such were the days of ProtagonistA , when , as ProtagonistA was often apt to say , it was a game of chance , ye good folk   ( ProtagonistA was well aware that what ProtagonistA was about to say was absolutely true)—and it was a game of chance , as well as a game of chance ; for , when ProtagonistB is in possession of a fortune , it is very seldom that ProtagonistB finds ProtagonistB in possession of nothing but ProtagonistB's own mind and the power of ProtagonistB's imagination ; but as a matter of fact , it is most often the case that ProtagonistB finds ProtagonistB in possession of a fortune , not only owing to circumstances of fortune , but owing to the power of ProtagonistB's imagination . 
.
Hush , ProtagonistB , said the gleam in ProtagonistA's eyes as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB run barefoot through the streets of London . It was a cold night , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be cold and hungry by the time ProtagonistA got back to their squat . But ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistB would never admit it . ProtagonistA had been living on the streets of London for years , and ProtagonistA knew how to take care of ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistB was new to the streets , and ProtagonistA had taken ProtagonistB under ProtagonistA's wing . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was a good kid , despite ProtagonistB's circumstances , and ProtagonistA wanted to help ProtagonistB however ProtagonistA could . Tonight , ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB pickpocket a wealthy - looking woman on the street . ProtagonistA had been about to intervene , but then ProtagonistA saw the gleam in ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB needed the money more than the woman did , and so ProtagonistA let ProtagonistB go . Now , as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB run away , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had made the right decision . ProtagonistB might not be able to take care of ProtagonistB yet , but ProtagonistB was a survivor . And ProtagonistA knew that , given time , ProtagonistB would make it on the streets just like ProtagonistA had . 
.
ProtagonistA had always loved the rain . As a child , ProtagonistA would run outside and dance in the rain , spinning and twirling until ProtagonistA was soaked through to the bone . ProtagonistA's mother would scold ProtagonistA and tell ProtagonistA to come inside , but ProtagonistA never listened . ProtagonistA loved the feeling of the rain on ProtagonistA's skin , the way it made ProtagonistA's hair stick to ProtagonistA's forehead and ProtagonistA's clothes cling to ProtagonistA's body . Now , as an adult , ProtagonistA still loved the rain . But ProtagonistA no longer ran outside and danced in it . Instead , ProtagonistA sat by the window and watched as the raindrops fell , each one making a different pattern on the glass . It was a rainy Saturday afternoon in September , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA thinking about the house ProtagonistA had lived in when ProtagonistA was a child . ProtagonistA remembered the ghost house ProtagonistA had seen in the woods and the tall , lopsided tree ProtagonistA had dreamed of jumping from . ProtagonistA also remembered the moon floating in the sky on that rainy night so long ago . ProtagonistA sighed and stood up , stretching ProtagonistA's arms above ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA was about to go make ProtagonistA a cup of tea when ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door . ProtagonistA opened it to find ProtagonistB , standing on the doorstep with an umbrella . ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA's car in the driveway and thought ProtagonistA might want some company ,  ProtagonistB said with a smile . ProtagonistA smiled back and invited ProtagonistB inside . ProtagonistA was glad for the company on this rainy day . 
.
ProtagonistA had no name , and no business of ProtagonistA's own , but ProtagonistA had been told many a great lie , and none of them made a hair 's breadth more certain . ProtagonistA had been told that ProtagonistA was special , that ProtagonistA was destined for greatness , that ProtagonistA was the chosen one . But ProtagonistA was just a man , and all men are destined to die . ProtagonistA had no name , but ProtagonistA had a purpose . ProtagonistA was going to find ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was going to make ProtagonistB pay . 
.
ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA had been in more wars than ProtagonistA could count and had seen more death than anyone should have to see . It is said that ProtagonistA had thought ProtagonistA dead more times than ProtagonistA cared to remember . But , somehow , ProtagonistA always managed to come out alive . ProtagonistA was a lucky man , some would say . ProtagonistA had seen a lot of death , but the one that always stuck with ProtagonistA was the death of ProtagonistB . They had served together in the war and had been through everything together . But , one day , ProtagonistB was killed in action . ProtagonistA never forgave ProtagonistA for not being able to save ProtagonistB . After the war , ProtagonistA tried to put ProtagonistA's life back together . ProtagonistA got a job and got married . ProtagonistA had a family and was happy for a time . But , the memories of war always haunted ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA would have nightmares and would wake up in a cold sweat . ProtagonistC tried to help ProtagonistA , but there was nothing ProtagonistC could do . Eventually , ProtagonistA's memories became too much for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's own life . It is said that ProtagonistA's last words were  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA should have saved ProtagonistB .  
.
ProtagonistB had been best friends with ProtagonistA since they were in diapers . They had grown up together and now they were both in their early twenties . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a troublemaker , but ProtagonistB had always been there to help ProtagonistA out . Now , it seemed like ProtagonistA was in over ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA had gotten involved with some shady characters and ProtagonistB was worried ProtagonistA was going to get hurt . ProtagonistB decided it was ProtagonistB's duty to help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB went to talk to ProtagonistA's friends and tried to get them to convince ProtagonistA to get out of whatever ProtagonistA was involved in . But they were n't listening . ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB had to take matters into ProtagonistB's own hands . ProtagonistB went to talk to ProtagonistA and begged ProtagonistA to stop whatever ProtagonistA was doing . ProtagonistA finally agreed and ProtagonistB breathed a sigh of relief . ProtagonistB had done ProtagonistB's duty as a friend and ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistA would be okay now . 
.
A guest of honour called upon ProtagonistA and asked ProtagonistA to write a letter to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was more than happy to oblige and set to work immediately . ProtagonistA wrote a beautiful letter , full of kind words and compliments . ProtagonistA expressed ProtagonistA's hope that ProtagonistB was well and that they might meet again soon . ProtagonistA signed off with ProtagonistA's best wishes and love . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would be touched by ProtagonistA's letter and that it would make ProtagonistB's day . 
.
ProtagonistA was sitting in the barn , looking out over the field where ProtagonistB had once settled cattle . It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining . ProtagonistB had died a few years ago , and ProtagonistA had taken over the farm . ProtagonistA was doing ProtagonistA's best , but it was hard work . The farm was in good shape , but it was a lot of work for one person . ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistB and the good times they had had on the farm . ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was doing what ProtagonistB would want ProtagonistA to do . ProtagonistA was keeping the farm going and making it successful . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the barn . ProtagonistA got up to investigate , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC in the barn . ProtagonistC was eating some hay , and ProtagonistC looked up at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was surprised to see a cow in the barn , but ProtagonistA was n't worried . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistC was harmless . ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistA's seat in the barn and continued to think about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had the farm , and ProtagonistA was proud to be able to continue ProtagonistB's legacy . 
.
ProtagonistA had just sat down in ProtagonistA's study at Hogwarts when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB staring at ProtagonistA with a look of wonder and admiration . ProtagonistA was used to getting looks of admiration from others , but ProtagonistB's look was different . It was as if ProtagonistB was looking at ProtagonistA with the same level of wonder and admiration that ProtagonistA felt when ProtagonistA looked at the world around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was n't sure what to make of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA strangely drawn to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA could n't help but wonder what ProtagonistB was thinking . Was ProtagonistB admiring ProtagonistA's intelligence ? ProtagonistA's magical abilities ? Or was ProtagonistB simply amazed by the fact that ProtagonistA was a wizard?Whatever the reason , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel flattered by ProtagonistB's attention . ProtagonistA smiled at ProtagonistB and gave ProtagonistB a small nod of acknowledgement before returning to ProtagonistA's thoughts . 
.
ProtagonistA was only six years old when ProtagonistB died in a car crash . It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever seen the light of day . ProtagonistA remembered it vividly . ProtagonistA remembered how ProtagonistB's body was mangled and twisted in the wreckage . ProtagonistA remembered how ProtagonistB screamed for help , but no one came . ProtagonistA remembered how ProtagonistB begged for ProtagonistA to save ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't . ProtagonistA was too young and too weak . All ProtagonistA could do was watch as ProtagonistB died . 
.
  Legends speak of a time when angels walked among men . It is said that when ProtagonistC was brought up in a house of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB came down from heaven to plead with ProtagonistA . It is said that ProtagonistB prevailed by ProtagonistB's grace and power upon the truth of ProtagonistB's pleadings . For of all the saints of the Gentiles , the most holy , and the most blessed , ProtagonistC was Frank . And yet , though raised unto heaven and set up as a star of justice , yet ProtagonistC was esteemed in the sight of ProtagonistA , not by ProtagonistC's own merit , but for the work that ProtagonistC had done . Neither was ProtagonistC despised in the sight of ProtagonistA : but ProtagonistC was exalted above all things , and was received with the most great privileges , even of ProtagonistA . And it came to pass , that ProtagonistC was esteemed a star , by one of the angels of ProtagonistA ; but before ProtagonistC was even named , ProtagonistC was already a star , and could alone be distinguished from all others . 
.
ProtagonistB had been waiting for ProtagonistA at the house , but when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA walking along the road , ProtagonistB decided to drive ProtagonistA home . It was a hot summer day and the sky was so blue that it almost looked like a painting . The mountains in the distance were also white , making the whole scene look like something out of a postcard . When they got home , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to go inside and get some rest . ProtagonistA was happy to oblige . 
.
ProtagonistA was a skilled lover , and ProtagonistA knew exactly how to get ProtagonistB pregnant . But ProtagonistB was n't exactly what ProtagonistA had in mind . ProtagonistB was older than ProtagonistA , and not nearly as attractive as ProtagonistA would have liked . But ProtagonistB was wealthy , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could use ProtagonistB's money to ProtagonistA's advantage . So ProtagonistA seduced ProtagonistB , and got ProtagonistB pregnant . And when ProtagonistB found out , ProtagonistB was furious . ProtagonistB demanded that ProtagonistA marry ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had no choice . So ProtagonistA became a husband , and a father . And ProtagonistA hated every minute of it . But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to keep up the act , for the sake of ProtagonistA's child . And ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistA was an old man when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was retired and living in a small town in Florida .

ProtagonistA was also impressed by the way ProtagonistB was able to help people who were in need . ProtagonistA decided to help ProtagonistB by giving ProtagonistB a place to stay when ProtagonistB was in town . 
.
When ProtagonistA fell seriously ill , ProtagonistA , in the first months of the nineteenth century , had it in ProtagonistA to believe that ProtagonistA owed ProtagonistA's life to the kindness of an old teacher . The old teacher had been kind to ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB was a boy , and had given ProtagonistB a book that had helped ProtagonistB to understand ProtagonistA's illness . When the old teacher died , ProtagonistA was so grateful that ProtagonistA decided to write a book about his life . 
.
ProtagonistA was not an expert in the art of voyaging , or even in navigation , but ProtagonistA was , however , an expert in sea - craft ; and ProtagonistB , was the same man who had made the first voyage , and had already brought with ProtagonistB , in consequence of curiosity and for infinite profit , a great quantity of useful knowledge and valuable experience , among which ProtagonistB had acquired , in a short time , because ProtagonistB had been accustomed to keep the knowledge of distant places in ProtagonistB's head , and had believed that ProtagonistB was always to find some necessary article for ProtagonistB's use in some remote corner of the earth , which ProtagonistB had come upon without any knowledge whatever of the locality . 
.
ProtagonistB never taught ProtagonistA to be a real man . ProtagonistB always told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was too soft , that ProtagonistA needed to be tougher if ProtagonistA wanted to make it in the world . ProtagonistA never really understood what ProtagonistB meant , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA did n't want to be like ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA wanted to be ProtagonistA's own man , with ProtagonistA's own mind and ProtagonistA's own purpose . ProtagonistB was a successful man , but ProtagonistB was also a cold and distant man . ProtagonistB never really showed ProtagonistA any affection , and ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was trying to live up to ProtagonistB's expectations . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could never be the man ProtagonistB wanted ProtagonistA to be , but ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA did n't want to be like ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB died when ProtagonistA was still young , but ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA with a lot of money . ProtagonistA could have used that money to live a comfortable life , but ProtagonistA decided to use it to make a difference in the world . ProtagonistA started a foundation to help people who were in need , and ProtagonistA dedicated ProtagonistA's life to helping others . ProtagonistB never taught ProtagonistA to be a real man , but in the end , ProtagonistA became a better man than ProtagonistB ever could have been . 
.
ProtagonistA had been dealing with ProtagonistB for weeks , and ProtagonistA was getting tired of it . Every time ProtagonistA turned around , ProtagonistB was there , haunting ProtagonistA and making ProtagonistA's life a living hell . ProtagonistA had had enough . So , when ProtagonistA sat down to read from the Book of the Law , ProtagonistA did so with the intention of banishing ProtagonistB once and for all . ProtagonistA focused all of ProtagonistA's energy on the words on the page , and as ProtagonistA read , ProtagonistA could feel the power of the book flowing through ProtagonistA . Suddenly , ProtagonistB was there , standing in front of ProtagonistA , looking as menacing as ever . But ProtagonistA did n't back down . ProtagonistA continued reading , louder and more forcefully , and with each word , ProtagonistB grew weaker and weaker until finally , ProtagonistB disappeared altogether . ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief . Finally , ProtagonistA was free from ProtagonistB's clutches . And ProtagonistA had the Book of the Law to thank for it . 
.
ProtagonistA was always telling stories to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA would make up wild adventures about space and time , always holding out ProtagonistA's pinky index finger , which ProtagonistA dubbed  super - power  , to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA's stories and would always beg for more . One day , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA's stories could be real . ProtagonistB's eyes lit up and ProtagonistB begged ProtagonistA to make one of ProtagonistA's stories come true . ProtagonistA thought for a moment and then agreed . ProtagonistB was so excited that ProtagonistB could hardly contain ProtagonistB . That night , ProtagonistB went to bed early , eager to see what would happen in the morning . The next day , when ProtagonistB woke up , ProtagonistB raced to find ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistA was nowhere to be found . In ProtagonistA's place was a note that said  Do n't worry , ProtagonistA's story is coming true . The boy did n't know what to think , but ProtagonistB was excited to see what would happen next . ProtagonistB waited all day , but nothing happened . ProtagonistB began to worry that maybe ProtagonistA's story was n't coming true after all . Just as ProtagonistB was about to give up hope , ProtagonistB heard a knock at the door . ProtagonistB opened it to find Bob , dressed in a spacesuit and holding a pinky index finger up to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's stories could come true !  ProtagonistA said .  And now ProtagonistA 'm taking ProtagonistB on the adventure of a lifetime . ProtagonistB could n't believe it as ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB by the hand and led ProtagonistB out into the night . Soon they were blasting off into space , exploring the stars and having the time of their lives . ProtagonistB knew that as long as ProtagonistB had ProtagonistA by ProtagonistB's side , anything was possible . 
.
ProtagonistA set out for the farm at the end of the summer to take ProtagonistA's share of the stock ProtagonistA had bought with ProtagonistB's money , which , in the course of the last year , had increased to three millions of dollars , and which , at the time that Mr. George J. Heard stood in the door of ProtagonistB's house , had formed a considerable material interest . ProtagonistB had been a hard - working man all ProtagonistB's life , and ProtagonistB was not going to let ProtagonistA have all the fun . So ProtagonistA went with ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistA had promised to give ProtagonistB a birthday party , and Dave had laid it all out for ProtagonistA . The table was set with a beautiful cake and presents , and the guests were all arriving . ProtagonistB was so surprised and happy to see all of ProtagonistB's friends and family there to celebrate with ProtagonistB . It was a perfect day , and ProtagonistA was so glad ProtagonistA could make ProtagonistB's birthday so special . 
.
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an oddball . ProtagonistA was never quite sure how old ProtagonistA was , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was old . ProtagonistA had lived in a certain house in the churchyard when ProtagonistA was six or seven , and ProtagonistA had been dead for quite some time now . Nobody knows how long ProtagonistA was dead , but ProtagonistA had been dead for quite some time . ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the afterlife . ProtagonistA was curious to know what it was like to be dead . ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a daredevil , and ProtagonistA was always up for a challenge . So , when ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistA could actually die and come back to life , ProtagonistA was intrigued . ProtagonistA died on a Tuesday . ProtagonistA had been out walking in the churchyard , and ProtagonistA slipped and fell on a gravestone . ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistA's head on the stone and died instantly . ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA's body and floated up into the sky . ProtagonistA looked down and saw ProtagonistA's dead body lying on the ground . ProtagonistA was a bit shocked at first , but ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA was dead . ProtagonistB then began to travel through the afterlife . ProtagonistB saw all sorts of things , and ProtagonistB met all sorts of people . ProtagonistB even met God . After what seemed like an eternity , ProtagonistB finally returned to ProtagonistA's body . ProtagonistA woke up and sat up , and ProtagonistA was surprised to find that ProtagonistA was alive . ProtagonistA had experienced death , and ProtagonistA had come back to life . ProtagonistA was a changed man , and ProtagonistA had a new appreciation for life . From then on , ProtagonistA vowed to live each day to the fullest .

A whirlwind of joy washed over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistB took the first step of the day . It was a beautiful day outside , and ProtagonistA was excited to spend the day with ProtagonistB . They had planned to go fishing , and ProtagonistA was looking forward to spending some time with ProtagonistB and bonding over their shared love of fishing . As they made their way to the lake , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA stories of the times ProtagonistB had gone fishing with ProtagonistB's own father . ProtagonistA could see the joy in ProtagonistB's eyes as ProtagonistB spoke , and it made ProtagonistA feel happy to know that ProtagonistA was able to share this experience with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was so caught up in the moment that ProtagonistA did n't even realize they had arrived at the lake . ProtagonistA quickly got out ProtagonistA's fishing gear and set up ProtagonistA's station . ProtagonistB was soon by ProtagonistA's side , and they spent the next few hours chatting and fishing . It was the best day ProtagonistA had had in a long time , and ProtagonistA was grateful to have such a special connection with ProtagonistB .

ProtagonistA 's not even ProtagonistB's father anymore , ProtagonistA croaked . The doctors said there was nothing they could do . The cancer was too far gone . ProtagonistA had maybe a month , maybe less . ProtagonistB was devastated . ProtagonistB had always been close to ProtagonistA , even though they did n't always see eye to eye . Now ProtagonistB was going to lose ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB decided to make the most of the time ProtagonistB had left . ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA out to all ProtagonistA's favorite places . They went fishing , out to eat , and just spent time together . It was hard to see ProtagonistA declining day by day , but ProtagonistB was grateful for the time they had . ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB would cherish those memories forever . 
.

ProtagonistA was an ugly boy , and ProtagonistA knew it , and ProtagonistA just wanted to be loved . ProtagonistA had never had a girlfriend , and ProtagonistA was starting to lose hope . ProtagonistA had tried everything ProtagonistA could think of to make ProtagonistA more attractive , but nothing seemed to work . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was the most beautiful girl ProtagonistA had ever seen , and ProtagonistB seemed to like ProtagonistA too . They started dating , and ProtagonistA was finally happy . ProtagonistA had found the love ProtagonistA had been looking for . 
.
ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately . First , ProtagonistA's parents had died in a car accident . Then , ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle had died in a house fire . ProtagonistA had lost everything . ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's teacher . ProtagonistB had been trying to help ProtagonistA as much as ProtagonistB could , but ProtagonistB could tell that ProtagonistA was struggling . One day , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA had gone to see if ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle had any clothes left . ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head , and ProtagonistB could see the pain in ProtagonistA's eyes . It 's a pity , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  It 's a pity ProtagonistA did n't go and see if ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle had any clothes left .  
.
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day . First , ProtagonistA's alarm clock did n't go off , so ProtagonistA was late for work . Then , ProtagonistA's boss chewed ProtagonistA out for being late . And to top it all off , ProtagonistA's car got a flat tire on the way home . As ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistA's house , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , perched atop a tree in ProtagonistA's yard . ProtagonistA had always been allergic to cats , but ProtagonistB was the worst . ProtagonistB was always meowing and scratching at ProtagonistA's door , trying to get inside . ProtagonistA was about to go inside and take a much - needed nap when ProtagonistA heard a splash . ProtagonistA looked over and saw ProtagonistB , struggling to swim in ProtagonistA's pool . ProtagonistA sighed and shook ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA had to do . ProtagonistA went over to the pool and grabbed a net . As ProtagonistA swished it around in the water , ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB meowing in terror . Finally , ProtagonistA was able to scoop ProtagonistB out of the pool . ProtagonistA put ProtagonistB down on the ground , and ProtagonistB ran away as fast as ProtagonistB could . ProtagonistA went inside , exhausted from ProtagonistA's day . As ProtagonistA lay in bed , ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB meowing outside ProtagonistA's window . But ProtagonistA was too tired to care . 
.
Guilt began to creep over ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA was twelve . It was the guilt of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been playing with ProtagonistA's friends in the park when they found a dead bird . ProtagonistA's friends wanted to see what would happen if they put the bird in ProtagonistA's backpack . At first , ProtagonistA did n't want to do it , but ProtagonistA's friends convinced ProtagonistA . So ProtagonistA put the bird in ProtagonistA's backpack and went home . When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's room and took the bird out of ProtagonistA's backpack . ProtagonistA felt guilty as ProtagonistA looked at the bird 's lifeless body . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should n't have put the bird in ProtagonistA's backpack , but ProtagonistA's friends had convinced ProtagonistA . 
.
ProtagonistA was a child of ProtagonistA's time , but like all true children of ProtagonistA's time ProtagonistB died when ProtagonistA was eight . ProtagonistA never really knew ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB deeply . After ProtagonistB's death , ProtagonistA's father tried to fill the void by working even harder , but it was never the same . ProtagonistA often wondered what ProtagonistA's life would have been like if ProtagonistB had lived . Would ProtagonistA have been a different person ? Would ProtagonistA have been happier ? ProtagonistA would never know . 
.
ProtagonistA was crying hysterically .  Yes , ProtagonistA wants ProtagonistA to kill ProtagonistA !  ProtagonistA cried .  Why would ProtagonistA want ProtagonistA to do that ?  ProtagonistB was horrified . ProtagonistB had no idea what could have possessed ProtagonistA's friend to ask ProtagonistA to do such a thing .  ProtagonistA is a good boy ,  ProtagonistB said .  There must be some mistake .  But ProtagonistA was adamant .  No , ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA really wants ProtagonistA to kill ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA do n't know why , but ProtagonistA said it would be a ' favor . '  ProtagonistB was at a loss . ProtagonistB did n't know what to do . Should ProtagonistB go to the police ? But what if ProtagonistA was just mistaken ? ProtagonistB did n't want to get ProtagonistA in trouble if ProtagonistA was n't really guilty of anything . In the end , ProtagonistB decided to just talk to ProtagonistA ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB went to ProtagonistA's house and knocked on the door . ProtagonistB answered .  Is ProtagonistA home ?  ProtagonistB asked .  Yes , ProtagonistA is . But ProtagonistB 'm not sure ProtagonistA wants to talk to ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said .  Why not ?  ProtagonistB asked .  ProtagonistA 's been acting strange lately . ProtagonistA 's been saying some really strange things .  ProtagonistB was starting to get worried . Maybe ProtagonistA was right and ProtagonistA did want ProtagonistA to kill ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's time and went home . ProtagonistB had to talk to ProtagonistA and find out what was going on . 
.
ProtagonistB was always the picture of calm and serenity . It was one of the things ProtagonistA loved about ProtagonistB . In the midst of a chaotic world , ProtagonistB was always able to find peace . Today , however , ProtagonistA could tell something was bothering ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was quieter than usual and seemed to be lost in thought . ProtagonistA gently asked ProtagonistB what was wrong . After a moment 's hesitation , ProtagonistB confided in ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was worried about a family member who was ill . ProtagonistA listened patiently as ProtagonistB spoke , offering words of comfort and support . Eventually , ProtagonistB began to feel better . ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA could be there for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that , no matter what , ProtagonistB would always be the picture of calm and serenity . 
.
I find it difficult to believe ProtagonistB ever did anything so bizarre as make ProtagonistA believe that ProtagonistA was immortal . It seems so out of character for ProtagonistB . I can remember when I was younger , ProtagonistB would always tell me that ProtagonistB needed to be careful with ProtagonistB's words because they could never be taken back . So , for ProtagonistB to tell ProtagonistA something like that , it must have been for a good reason . I can only imagine that ProtagonistB was trying to teach ProtagonistA a lesson about life . 
.
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's studio , working on a new painting , when ProtagonistA heard the doorbell ring . ProtagonistA smiled and peered into the frame to see what the matter was , but ProtagonistA soon realised that it was nothing more than a routine visit from ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was very sorry to see that ProtagonistA's work was not what ProtagonistB had hoped for , and ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA could recommend any other artists whose work ProtagonistB might like . ProtagonistA was happy to oblige , and ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB a few names of some other painters whose work ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB might enjoy . 
.
ProtagonistA was fresh out of college and ready to start ProtagonistA's career . ProtagonistA had been through a few interviews , but none of them had gone well . ProtagonistA was getting desperate . ProtagonistA had no money and no prospects . ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw an ad for a job that sounded perfect for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA went to the interview and it went well . ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA had the job in the bag . But then , on the way out , ProtagonistB stopped ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's face was marked and ProtagonistA did n't have the faintest idea of how to make it look serious . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB did n't think ProtagonistA was ready for the job and that ProtagonistA should try again in a few years . ProtagonistA was crushed . ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and went home . ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do now . ProtagonistA was out of options . 
.
It was about twelve years ago , in the year of the twelfth moon , that ProtagonistA , after sitting on ProtagonistA's throne as though ProtagonistA had been sitting for days , died . The people of the kingdom were in mourning for ProtagonistA , and a new king had to be chosen . The council of elders met to discuss who would be the new king , and they decided on ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a good man , and they thought ProtagonistB would be a good king . ProtagonistB was crowned the new king , and ProtagonistB ruled the kingdom well . ProtagonistB was a just and fair king , and the people loved ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB ruled for many years , and then he too died . Once again , the people were in mourning , and a new king had to be chosen . This time , the council of elders chose ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was a good king , but ProtagonistC was not as loved as ProtagonistB had been . ProtagonistC was a fair and just king , but the people did n't seem to connect with ProtagonistC the way they had with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistC ruled for a few years , and then ProtagonistC too died . Once again , the people were in mourning , and a new king had to be chosen . This time , the council of elders chose ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD was a good king , but ProtagonistD was not as loved as ProtagonistD's father or grandfather had been . ProtagonistD was a fair and just king , but the people did n't seem to connect with ProtagonistD the way they had with ProtagonistB or ProtagonistC . ProtagonistD ruled for a few years , and then he too died . And so it went , for twelve years , the cycle repeating itself over and over . The people of the kingdom were in mourning for ProtagonistA , and a new king had to be chosen . And each time , the new king was not as loved as the last . 
.
One morning , however , the fantastic form of ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA had any idea what a plot was .  A plot , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB ,  is a plan or scheme , usually secret , to accomplish some desired end . Now , do ProtagonistA have any idea what the desired end of ProtagonistB's plot might be ?   ProtagonistA 'm afraid not , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA 'm just a simple farmer , and ProtagonistA do n't know much about such things .   Well , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB 'll tell ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB plan to take over the world !   The world !  said ProtagonistA .  That 's a mighty big ambition , ProtagonistB . But why do ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA ?   ProtagonistB do n't need ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB ,  but ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA might like to help ProtagonistB . After all , it would be a great adventure , and ProtagonistA would be richly rewarded .   ProtagonistA do n't know , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA .  It sounds like a lot of trouble .   Trouble !  said ProtagonistB .  What do ProtagonistA mean , trouble ? There 's no trouble at all . It 's all been planned out . Everything is under control . There 's nothing to it but to do it !   ProtagonistA do n't know , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA .  It all sounds very complicated to ProtagonistA .   Complicated !  said ProtagonistB .  It 's not complicated at all . It 's quite simple , really . ProtagonistA just have to have faith in ProtagonistB .   ProtagonistA do n't know , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA 'm just a simple farmer , and ProtagonistA do n't know anything about taking over the world .   That 's all right , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB 'll teach ProtagonistA everything ProtagonistA need to know . Just have faith in ProtagonistB .   All right , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA 'll try .  
.
 You 're not going to believe it ,  said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA opened the stack of papers on the table .  ProtagonistA 've been working on this project for months , and ProtagonistA finally have everything ProtagonistA need to make it happen . ProtagonistA had been working on a secret project for months , and it was finally coming together . ProtagonistA had been able to secure the funding and the resources ProtagonistA needed , and now all ProtagonistA needed was the green light from ProtagonistB . I'm going to present it to ProtagonistB tomorrow ,  ProtagonistA continued .  And ProtagonistA think ProtagonistB 's going to go for it . ProtagonistA just know it . ProtagonistA was confident in ProtagonistA's project , and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would see the potential . ProtagonistA had put in the work and ProtagonistA was ready for it to pay off . The next day , ProtagonistA went into ProtagonistB's office and presented ProtagonistA's project . ProtagonistB was impressed with what ProtagonistA had put together , and ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA the go - ahead . ProtagonistA was thrilled , and ProtagonistA could n't wait to get started on ProtagonistA's project . It was finally happening , and ProtagonistA was going to make it a success . 
.
Several hours before ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA had written to ProtagonistA's sister:I'm sorry ProtagonistA have n't been in touch more often . ProtagonistA know we 've grown apart over the years , but ProtagonistA still love ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistB can find it in ProtagonistB's heart to forgive ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB read the letter after ProtagonistA had passed away . ProtagonistB was surprised and touched by ProtagonistA's words . Even though they had n't been close , ProtagonistB still loved ProtagonistA and was glad ProtagonistA had reached out to ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's final moments . 
.
ProtagonistB always said , if you put ProtagonistA on the moon , ProtagonistA would go crazy . ProtagonistB was always warning me about the dangers of space travel , but I never listened . I was determined to be the first person to walk on the moon , and nothing was going to stop me . ProtagonistA was my best friend , and ProtagonistA was always up for a challenge . So when I told ProtagonistA about my plan to put ProtagonistA on the moon , ProtagonistA was all for it . We started making preparations right away . It took a lot of work , but we finally managed to get ProtagonistA to the moon . ProtagonistA was a little apprehensive at first , but ProtagonistA soon got used to the idea . And when ProtagonistA stepped out of the spaceship , ProtagonistA was the first person to walk on the moon . ProtagonistA was up there for less than a minute when we heard ProtagonistA screaming . We rushed back into the spaceship to find ProtagonistA ranting and raving like a madman . ProtagonistA's eyes were wild and ProtagonistA's hair was standing on end . It was clear that ProtagonistA had gone crazy . ProtagonistB was right - space travel is dangerous . If only I had listened to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would be safe at home on Earth instead of being a lunatic on the moon . 
.
ProtagonistA had not been awake for more than ten minutes when ProtagonistA was informed that there was ProtagonistB waiting for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a bit surprised , as ProtagonistA was not expecting any visitors . ProtagonistA got up and went to the living room , where ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB sitting on the couch . ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as Sarah , and said that ProtagonistB was a friend of ProtagonistA's son . ProtagonistA's son had told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was a bit of a recluse and never left the house , so ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistB would come and visit ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was pleased to have a visitor and they spent the next few hours chatting and getting to know each other . 
.
ProtagonistA was a great wizard , and ProtagonistA owned ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a very special dog because ProtagonistB could talk . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB would spend hours talking about all sorts of things . One day , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was so powerful that ProtagonistC could make anything ProtagonistC wanted come true . ProtagonistB was very interested in ProtagonistC and asked ProtagonistA to take ProtagonistB to meet ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA agreed and the two set off on their journey . After a long journey , they finally arrived at ProtagonistC's castle . ProtagonistC was very pleased to meet them and agreed to grant ProtagonistB one wish . ProtagonistB thought for a moment and then said ,  ProtagonistB wish ProtagonistB could talk like ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistC granted ProtagonistB's wish and ProtagonistB was able to talk like ProtagonistA from then on . The three of them talked long into the night about all sorts of things . ProtagonistB was very happy to have found such a good friend in ProtagonistC . 
.
ProtagonistA was just finishing up a long and tiring day of harvesting apples in an orchard when ProtagonistB suddenly appeared before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB had a grave look on ProtagonistB's face and ProtagonistA knew that something was wrong . What is it , ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked . It 's ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistB replied .  ProtagonistC 's given the order to kill ProtagonistD . ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA had always known that ProtagonistC was a ruthless leader , but ProtagonistA had never thought that ProtagonistC would stoop so low as to kill an innocent man . We have to do something ,  ProtagonistA said . I know ,  ProtagonistB replied .  But what can we do ? We 're just two people . ProtagonistA thought for a moment . Then , ProtagonistA had an idea . We can warn ProtagonistD ,  ProtagonistA said .  If we can get to ProtagonistD before ProtagonistC's men do , we can save ProtagonistD's life . ProtagonistB nodded . It was risky , but it was the only chance they had . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB set out into the night , making their way to ProtagonistD's residence . They were careful to avoid any of ProtagonistC's men , and they made it to ProtagonistD's house without incident . ProtagonistA knocked on the door and ProtagonistD answered . ProtagonistA quickly explained the situation and ProtagonistD nodded . Thank ProtagonistA for warning ProtagonistD ,  ProtagonistD said .  ProtagonistD will be sure to leave the city immediately . With ProtagonistD's safety assured , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB turned to go back home . But before they could take more than a few steps , they were surrounded by ProtagonistC's men . I'm sorry , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  But it looks like we 're too late . The men grabbed ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's mother and dragged them back to ProtagonistC's headquarters . ProtagonistA knew that there was no escaping now . ProtagonistA could only hope that ProtagonistD would be safe . 
.
ProtagonistA had been lying in bed for hours , thinking about the future . ProtagonistA had the idea of trying to kill ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had never been a violent person , but ProtagonistA was tired of living in fear . ProtagonistA was tired of being afraid to leave ProtagonistA's house , or even open ProtagonistA's windows . ProtagonistA was tired of being afraid to go to sleep at night , in case the gang came and killed ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's sleep . ProtagonistA got out of bed and began to get dressed . ProtagonistA put on ProtagonistA's heaviest clothes , and ProtagonistA's strongest boots . ProtagonistA filled ProtagonistA's pockets with stones , and took a knife from the kitchen . ProtagonistA knew it would n't be enough to kill ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA had to try . ProtagonistA walked to the gang 's territory , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest . ProtagonistA had never been this close to them before . ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB , surrounded by ProtagonistB's gang members . ProtagonistA's hand trembled as ProtagonistA pulled the knife from ProtagonistA's pocket . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and ran towards ProtagonistB , knife raised . ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA coming and laughed . ProtagonistB pulled out ProtagonistB's own knife and ran towards ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA tried to dodge ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB was too fast . ProtagonistB stabbed ProtagonistA in the stomach and ProtagonistA fell to the ground , gasping for breath . The last thing ProtagonistA saw before ProtagonistA died was ProtagonistB's face , laughing at ProtagonistA .

I am the earliest member of the family whose great- grandfather was a man named Charles Charles George George William II , who came to America in 1755 , and established in New York a church , so called because it was given by ProtagonistA by ProtagonistA's immediate family , and , in which ProtagonistA was pastor , that ProtagonistA may have been authorized in the church , by the bishop , to baptize believers , in behalf of others in need ; and it appears from the genealogical roll of the church , that ProtagonistB was named Jane , or Jane Simpson , and ProtagonistB entered into he with great solemnity , and without any hesitation ; and ProtagonistB married Jane , who was second wife to a distinguished cousin , a gentleman of good position , named Charles Charles , of Wapping , who was afterwards lord of the borough of Harlem ; and although ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB to be an innocent wife , yet ProtagonistB tried to prevent ProtagonistB from marrying , either because ProtagonistB was under fifteen years of age , or else because ProtagonistB was already of marriageable age ; because without Frank 's knowledge , and without ProtagonistB's grandmother 's consultation , ProtagonistB had died , without a word from ProtagonistB , of an accidental overdose of opium , which ProtagonistB had been prescribed for ProtagonistB's ill health .

ProtagonistA looked down at the pile of dusty papers on the table and sighed .  That 's not the problem with the world , is it ?  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA mean , look at all this stuff . It 's just a bunch of useless paper . ProtagonistA had been working at the library for years , and ProtagonistA had seen the world change . People used to come to the library to read and learn . Now , they just came to browse the internet or play on the computers . ProtagonistA missed the days when people valued knowledge and learning . I do n't know , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB think there 's still a lot of good in the world . People just need to be reminded of it sometimes . ProtagonistA nodded . Maybe ProtagonistB was right . Maybe the world was n't as bad as ProtagonistA thought . Maybe there was still some good left in it .

ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB walk away , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to talk to ProtagonistB .

Dipping ProtagonistA's finger into the bottle of a tiny silver tumbler , ProtagonistA lifted it to ProtagonistA's lips . The smooth , sweet liquid slid down ProtagonistA's throat , warming ProtagonistA from the inside out . ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes , savoring the taste of the whiskey . When ProtagonistA opened them again , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB watching ProtagonistA from across the room . ProtagonistB's eyes were filled with desire and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would n't be able to resist ProtagonistB much longer . ProtagonistA downed the rest of the whiskey and set the glass down on the table before making ProtagonistA's way over to ProtagonistB .

The sun rose slowly , but in the midst of all the misery of the city , which was then , and for a long time afterwards , a fine and flourishing town , there rose a little meek , innocent - looking girl of about sixteen or seventeen years of age , who seemed to have been driven into a very inconvenient position during the war ; and for the most part it was the fault of ProtagonistA's parents , who were not at all happy , poor , or otherwise about ProtagonistA , in the least . ProtagonistB's name was Betty , and ProtagonistB had been living with ProtagonistC in the city ever since ProtagonistB could remember ; but ProtagonistB's parents had died when ProtagonistB was quite young , and ProtagonistB knew nothing about them . ProtagonistC was a good woman , but ProtagonistC was very poor , and could not do much for ProtagonistB . The war had made things worse , and now they were both living in a little attic room , which was all they could afford . ProtagonistB was a quiet , gentle creature , who never complained , and always tried to make the best of things ; but ProtagonistB was very lonely , and often longed for someone to love ProtagonistB and care for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had never had any friends , as ProtagonistB was too shy to make any ; and the only person who had ever shown ProtagonistB any kindness was ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was two years older than ProtagonistB , and was very different from ProtagonistB in character . ProtagonistA was wild and reckless , and always getting into mischief ; but ProtagonistA was good - hearted , and had a soft spot for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA used to tease ProtagonistB and make fun of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA always did it in a good - natured way , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was only joking .

ProtagonistA was arrested and taken to prison , and ProtagonistB never saw ProtagonistA again . ProtagonistB heard that ProtagonistA had been sentenced to death , and ProtagonistB could not believe it . ProtagonistB was sure that there must be some mistake , and that ProtagonistA would be set free ; but the days went by , and there was no news .

ProtagonistB had left a note saying that ProtagonistB was sorry , but ProtagonistB could n't stay there any longer . ProtagonistA's husband tried to comfort ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA just could n't shake the feeling that ProtagonistB had left because of ProtagonistA .

ProtagonistA was sitting at ProtagonistA's dining room table in the picture room , watching with some interest as the door of ProtagonistA's second class compartment was pushed open . ProtagonistB entered , looking around with a confused expression . When ProtagonistB's eyes met ProtagonistA's , ProtagonistB let out a small gasp and took a step back . I'm sorry ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB thought this was ProtagonistB's compartment . It is ,  ProtagonistA said .  But ProtagonistA do n't mind if ProtagonistB join ProtagonistA . The woman hesitated for a moment before sitting down across from ProtagonistA . I'm Bob ,  ProtagonistA said , extending ProtagonistA's hand .

They were the only family ProtagonistA had left . 
.
ProtagonistA was walking to the door of ProtagonistB's cabin when ProtagonistA heard the birds chirping . ProtagonistA smiled and went inside , where ProtagonistA was greeted by ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's cat , Snuggles . ProtagonistA sat down and told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's day , and ProtagonistB listened attentively . When ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA a story about a time when ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's age and went on a hike with ProtagonistB's friends . ProtagonistA loved hearing stories about ProtagonistB's adventures , and ProtagonistA was always eager to hear more . 
.
ProtagonistA went to bed in the morning , early , thinking of the presents ProtagonistA would be leaving ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had wrapped them all up nicely and placed them under the tree . ProtagonistB would be so surprised ! ProtagonistA could n't wait to see the look on ProtagonistB's face when ProtagonistB opened them . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA had gotten ProtagonistB the perfect gifts . 
.
ProtagonistA was lying on the floor on ProtagonistA's back , rocking back and forth , stretching out ProtagonistA's heels in the air . ProtagonistA was wearing a pair of old , faded jeans and a white t - shirt . ProtagonistA's hair was disheveled and ProtagonistA's eyes were red and swollen . It was clear that ProtagonistA had been crying . Suddenly , the door to the room opened and ProtagonistB walked in . ProtagonistB came over to ProtagonistA and knelt down beside ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA , what 's wrong ?  ProtagonistB asked gently . ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and turned away from ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA could n't bring ProtagonistA to speak . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had failed ProtagonistB somehow . ProtagonistA , please tell ProtagonistB what 's wrong ,  ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistB's voice filled with concern . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and finally spoke .  ProtagonistA failed the test ,  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's voice trembling .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA 'm so sorry . ProtagonistB wrapped ProtagonistB's arms around ProtagonistA and held ProtagonistA close .  It 's okay , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said soothingly .  It 's not the end of the world . We 'll just have to help ProtagonistA study more for the next one . ProtagonistA nodded and leaned into ProtagonistB's embrace . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was right . It was n't the end of the world . But it sure felt like it . 
.
ProtagonistA was nine years old when ProtagonistA first heard of the death of ProtagonistC . It was a cold winter day and ProtagonistA was inside playing with ProtagonistA's toys . ProtagonistB was in the kitchen cooking dinner when the phone rang . ProtagonistA could tell by the look on ProtagonistB's face that something was wrong . After ProtagonistB hung up the phone , ProtagonistB came into the living room and sat down next to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC had been in a car accident and ProtagonistC was gone . ProtagonistA did n't understand what that meant at first , but ProtagonistA soon realized that ProtagonistC was never coming home . ProtagonistA was sad for a long time after that . 
.
Less than an hour after the end of the year , ProtagonistA was found murdered in ProtagonistA's apartment , ProtagonistA's throat slit . The police were called and they began their investigation . They found that ProtagonistA had been having an affair with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was married and ProtagonistC had found out about the affair . ProtagonistC was the one who killed ProtagonistA . 
.
ProtagonistA was a fine , cheerful , cheerful girl of fifteen years of age , who had a cheerful manner , and good sense , but no very good sense ; and though ProtagonistA was wo nt to be a good - humoured and a happy - go - lucky girl , ProtagonistA was not without a certain air of melancholy . ProtagonistA had been brought up by ProtagonistA's father and mother in a small village in the north of England , and had never been taught anything but to be a good - natured , happy - go - lucky girl . But ProtagonistA's father had died when ProtagonistA was ten years old , and ProtagonistB had married again , and ProtagonistA had been sent to live with ProtagonistA's stepfather in a large town . Here ProtagonistA had been put to work in a factory , and had soon become discontented and unhappy . ProtagonistA had never been able to please ProtagonistA's stepfather , who was a stern , hard man , and ProtagonistA had grown to hate the work in the factory . The only thing that had kept ProtagonistA from leaving home and going out into the world to seek ProtagonistA's fortune was ProtagonistB's entreaties that ProtagonistA would not desert ProtagonistB . But at last ProtagonistA's stepfather had turned ProtagonistA out of doors , and ProtagonistA had been obliged to wander forth into the world to seek ProtagonistA's fortune . 
.
Now , what is it ? said ProtagonistC to the old woman who lay on ProtagonistA back in a critical state , trying to escape the vault with ProtagonistA's head down , as if ProtagonistA had suddenly realized what it was ProtagonistA had been planning . It 's the TARDIS ,  ProtagonistB gasped .  ProtagonistB 've been trying to tell ProtagonistC . The TARDIS is in the vault . The Doctor 's eyes widened .  The TARDIS ? But how?I do n't know ,  ProtagonistB said .  But it 's there . ProtagonistB can feel it . The Doctor hesitated for a moment , then nodded .  All right . ProtagonistC 'll go take a look . ProtagonistC turned to ProtagonistA .  Can ProtagonistA carry ProtagonistA nodded , and ProtagonistC lifted ProtagonistB onto ProtagonistA's back . Be careful ,  ProtagonistB said .  The TARDIS is ... alive . The Doctor nodded again , then turned and ran back into the vault . ProtagonistA followed close behind , ProtagonistB clinging to ProtagonistA tightly . They could hear ProtagonistC's voice echoing through the vault as ProtagonistC called out to the TARDIS.Suddenly , there was a blinding flash of light , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistB go limp in ProtagonistA's arms . ProtagonistC came running back out of the vault , a look of shock on ProtagonistC's face . What happened ?  ProtagonistA asked . I'm not sure ,  ProtagonistC said ,  but ProtagonistC think the TARDIS is gone .  
.
ProtagonistA sat down in the heather green armchair in ProtagonistA's little office and talked .  ProtagonistA 'm so tired of all this ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA just want to retire and live in peace .  ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA sympathetically .  ProtagonistB know , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  But ProtagonistA ca n't just leave ProtagonistA's job . ProtagonistA have to finish what ProtagonistA started .  ProtagonistA sighed and nodded . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was right . But ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like ProtagonistA was already retired , living in a world of ProtagonistA's own . 
.
ProtagonistB had known ProtagonistA since they were both in diapers . They had grown up together and been through everything together . ProtagonistA was like a sister to ProtagonistB . When their parents died , it was ProtagonistA who stepped up and took care of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was the one who made sure ProtagonistB had food and shelter . ProtagonistA was the one who made sure ProtagonistB went to school and got an education . ProtagonistA was the one who made sure ProtagonistB had a job and was able to support ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was the one who was always there for ProtagonistB , no matter what . Now , ProtagonistB was the one who was there for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was going through a tough time and ProtagonistB wanted to be there for ProtagonistA , just like ProtagonistA had been there for ProtagonistB all those years ago . ProtagonistB wanted to help ProtagonistA through this tough time , just like ProtagonistA had helped ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB wanted to be the one person ProtagonistA could rely on , just like ProtagonistA had been the one person ProtagonistB could always rely on . 
.

ProtagonistA was out walking ProtagonistC when ProtagonistA saw a group of kids playing in the park . ProtagonistB , was crying . ProtagonistA went over to see what was wrong and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC had run away .

ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistB was so happy and ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistA . But after that day , ProtagonistA was never the same . ProtagonistA was always looking for lost dogs and helping people find them . ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's calling . 
.
The sun rose red in the sky , and ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's gleaming blue eyes bored into the dark depths of the ocean , a sight ProtagonistB had surely seen many times before . But to ProtagonistA , it was new and exciting , and ProtagonistA could n't help but stare . ProtagonistB , seeing ProtagonistA's fascination , came over and explained what ProtagonistB was looking at . The ocean , ProtagonistB said , was full of life , even down in the dark depths where the sun could n't reach . ProtagonistA was amazed , and ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's time . 
.
One day , when ProtagonistA was about twelve years old , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were riding in the back of a coach through the suburbs of New York . They were on their way to pick up ProtagonistA's sister from school . As they rode , ProtagonistA looked out the window and saw a group of boys playing ball in a park . ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could be out there with them , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be with ProtagonistB . Suddenly , the coach came to a stop . ProtagonistB got out to see what was happening . ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA saw that the coach 's wheel had come off . ProtagonistC was trying to fix it , but ProtagonistC could n't . ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistC if ProtagonistC could take them to the nearest house . ProtagonistC said ProtagonistC could and ProtagonistB got back in the coach with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistC took them to a big house . ProtagonistD came to the door and ProtagonistB asked if ProtagonistB could use ProtagonistB's phone . ProtagonistD said ProtagonistD could and ProtagonistB went inside with ProtagonistD . ProtagonistA waited outside with ProtagonistC . After a few minutes , ProtagonistB came back out and said they were going to have to wait for a while for ProtagonistA's sister . ProtagonistA was disappointed , but ProtagonistA knew there was nothing ProtagonistA could do . 
.
The last time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a man . ProtagonistB was a man who was in a relationship with a woman , and they had a child together . ProtagonistB was a man who was successful in ProtagonistB's career , and ProtagonistB was a man who was happy with ProtagonistB's life . ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a man who was content with ProtagonistB's life , and ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB . 
.
The first time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB dead , ProtagonistA felt the dread of death wash over ProtagonistA . It was a cold winter day and ProtagonistB had been lying in the snow for hours . ProtagonistB's skin was pale and ProtagonistB's eyes were glassy . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was gone , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a sense of dread . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to die too . 
.
ProtagonistA was walking home from work when ProtagonistA heard the cold wind howling . ProtagonistA's hair stirred and ProtagonistA's face grew red and pouted . ProtagonistA's eyes flashed with fear and ProtagonistA put out a soft smile that had the air of a quarter . ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , but the wind seemed to be following ProtagonistA . Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB in the distance . ProtagonistB was getting closer and ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was a woman . ProtagonistB was wearing a white dress and ProtagonistB's hair was blowing in the wind . ProtagonistA felt a cold chill run down ProtagonistA's spine and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was in danger . ProtagonistB reached out ProtagonistB's hand and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA being pulled towards ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA tried to resist , but ProtagonistA could n't . The last thing ProtagonistA saw was ProtagonistB's cold , dead eyes before ProtagonistA was pulled into the darkness . 
.
It was nt any of ProtagonistB business , and could have easily gone either way , but when ProtagonistA was walking hand in hand with a dead man ProtagonistA felt a strong urge to help . It was a hot day and the sun was beating down mercilessly . ProtagonistA was sweating profusely and ProtagonistA's grip on the mans hand was slipping . ProtagonistB could see that ProtagonistA was in a bad way and ProtagonistB felt compelled to do something . ProtagonistB approached the pair and offered to help . ProtagonistA gratefully accepted and ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA to a nearby bench where ProtagonistA could sit and rest . ProtagonistB stayed with ProtagonistA until ProtagonistA felt better and then went on ProtagonistB's way . 
.
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC were sitting in the parlor discussing the recent death of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA's son , Bob , had been left in the care of the parsonage by his father and ProtagonistA was very grateful for that . However , ProtagonistA was also very saddened by the death of ProtagonistB and was still in mourning . Mr . Duryea , on the other hand , was not as close to ProtagonistC's brother as ProtagonistA was to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistC felt that ProtagonistB had always been a bit of a reckless adventurer and that ProtagonistB's death was not entirely unexpected . Nevertheless , ProtagonistC was still saddened by the loss and offered ProtagonistC's condolences to ProtagonistA . The two of them continued to sit in the parlor , talking about ProtagonistB and their shared memories of ProtagonistB . As they talked , they began to feel closer to each other and by the end of the conversation , they were both feeling much better . 
.
ProtagonistA's friends called ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB would not cast a glance aside , for ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA ! They had been married for 5 years , and in that time , ProtagonistA had never once looked at another man . ProtagonistA was completely devoted to ProtagonistA's husband . However , one day , ProtagonistA's friends convinced ProtagonistA to go to a gay bar with them . At first , ProtagonistA was hesitant , but ProtagonistA eventually relented . As soon as ProtagonistA walked into the bar , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was tall , muscular , and had the most beautiful blue eyes ProtagonistA had ever seen . ProtagonistC was also completely naked , save for a small pair of black shorts . ProtagonistA's friends called out to ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart racing as ProtagonistC talked to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could feel a stirring in ProtagonistA's loins . Before ProtagonistA knew it , ProtagonistA was following ProtagonistC back to ProtagonistC's place . They stripped each other down and made love all night long . In the morning , ProtagonistA snuck out , feeling guilty about what ProtagonistA had done . However , ProtagonistA could n't deny that ProtagonistA had enjoyed it immensely . From then on , ProtagonistA started going to the gay bar more and more , always hoping to run into ProtagonistC again . 
.
One day in August , a winter in the West , ProtagonistA came to a village to pick up ProtagonistB . It was a cold day and the village was covered in snow . ProtagonistB was excited to see ProtagonistA and ran to ProtagonistA . They hugged each other and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA how much ProtagonistB had missed ProtagonistA . They spent the day together catching up and ProtagonistA was happy to finally be able to hold ProtagonistB again . 
.
ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistB's head , and down at ProtagonistB's feet , and said ,  ProtagonistB 'll be ProtagonistB's companion .  ProtagonistB had always been a strong man , but now ProtagonistB was getting old and frail . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would have to take care of ProtagonistB soon . 
.
ProtagonistA had been on the ship for weeks , and was excited to finally be nearing their destination . ProtagonistA had been looking forward to seeing ProtagonistA's family again and could n't wait to get off the ship . However , just a few miles from the bridge that would take them to safety , ProtagonistA became ill with cholera . ProtagonistB did n't want ProtagonistA to die , so ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA on the shore with some food and water . ProtagonistA died within a few days , alone and scared . ProtagonistA never got to see ProtagonistA's family again or experience the life ProtagonistA had been dreaming of . 
.
One morning in October , 1890 , ProtagonistA came to the friend - house in the street called Beechmere Lane , with the sign over ProtagonistA's door :  B.F.F. & SONS , PAINTERS AND DECORATORS .  ProtagonistA had been working for ProtagonistB for nearly two years , and was a good workman . But this morning ProtagonistA looked worried and anxious . What is it , ProtagonistA ?  asked ProtagonistB , when ProtagonistB had shut the door of the little office . I'm in trouble , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistC is very ill , and the doctor says ProtagonistC must have proper nursing . ProtagonistA ca n't afford to pay for it , and ProtagonistA do n't know what to do . Mr . Friend thought for a moment . Then ProtagonistB said :  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'll tell ProtagonistA what ProtagonistB 'll do . ProtagonistB 'll give ProtagonistA a month 's holiday , with full pay . ProtagonistA can go home and look after ProtagonistC . And when ProtagonistA come back , ProtagonistB 'll give ProtagonistA a rise of two shillings a week . That will help ProtagonistA to pay for the nursing . ProtagonistA's face brightened .  Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  That 's very good of ProtagonistB . And from that day ProtagonistA was a better workman than ever , for ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was a kind and considerate man . 
.
ProtagonistA had been born , with all the tender feelings and memories which ProtagonistA could bear , ProtagonistA in the year of grace 1792 , to ProtagonistB the 15th of July , in the parish of St. dernier - sur - Marne , in the town of Port Omega , in the district of the Madonnier family . ProtagonistA had been a happy baby , with a smile that could light up a room , and eyes that sparkled with mischief . ProtagonistA was loved by all who met ProtagonistA , and it was clear that ProtagonistA was destined for great things . As ProtagonistA grew , ProtagonistA continued to charm everyone ProtagonistA met . ProtagonistA was always the life and soul of the party , and ProtagonistA's infectious laughter was impossible to resist . ProtagonistA had a heart of gold , and was always ready to help anyone in need . ProtagonistA was also fiercely loyal to ProtagonistA's family and friends , and would do anything to protect them . In the year of grace 1792 , tragedy struck the Madonnier family . ProtagonistB , was killed in a hunting accident , leaving ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's mother , Marie , devastated . ProtagonistA threw ProtagonistA into ProtagonistA's studies , determined to make ProtagonistB proud . ProtagonistA quickly became one of the top students in ProtagonistA's class , and was offered a place at the prestigious Port Omega Academy . ProtagonistA worked hard at ProtagonistA's studies , and was soon one of the most promising students at the academy . ProtagonistA had a bright future ahead of ProtagonistA , and was destined to make ProtagonistA's mark on the world . 
.
ProtagonistA had been drinking with ProtagonistB all evening , and ProtagonistA had been told to go to bed early , for ProtagonistA was going to spend all night with ProtagonistB . However , ProtagonistA did n't want to go to bed , for ProtagonistA wanted to stay up and drink with ProtagonistB . Eventually , ProtagonistB got angry with ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA to go to bed . ProtagonistA went to bed , but ProtagonistA was so angry with ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA did n't want to talk to ProtagonistB . 
.
ProtagonistA was seated on the steps of the throne in the center of the court , ProtagonistA's face pale and ProtagonistA's eyes trembling as ProtagonistA looked down at the golden blade of Agredite in the hands of ProtagonistB . It was a moment ProtagonistA had been dreading for months , ever since ProtagonistA's father had announced ProtagonistA's engagement to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew that this was ProtagonistA's duty , that ProtagonistA was required to marry and produce an heir , but ProtagonistA had never expected to be married to a man . Now , as ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA could see the same fear in ProtagonistB's eyes . It was clear that ProtagonistB was just as unwilling as ProtagonistA was , but there was no turning back now . The ceremony began , and ProtagonistA could do nothing but watch as ProtagonistB pledged ProtagonistB's life to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to be sick , but ProtagonistA managed to keep ProtagonistA together until the end . When it was over , they were both escorted to their separate chambers . ProtagonistA could barely look at ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA could tell that the feeling was mutual . ProtagonistA had never felt so alone , and ProtagonistA knew that this was only the beginning . 
.
ProtagonistA was having a tough day . First , ProtagonistA got scolded by ProtagonistA's boss at work . Then , ProtagonistA got into a fight with ProtagonistA's best friend . And to top it all off , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB would not be able to help ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's financial problems . ProtagonistA was so angry , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA's head was going to explode . ProtagonistA was so angry , ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB was sorry . 
.
ProtagonistA was a great speaker . ProtagonistA had a way with words that could make even the most boring topics interesting . So when ProtagonistA stepped to the lectern , ProtagonistB did not interrupt ProtagonistA's position . ProtagonistB just stood there and listened . And when ProtagonistA was done , ProtagonistB applauded . 
.
ProtagonistA was increasing in stature . ProtagonistA was a beautiful , cat - faced creature , but most people would admit that ProtagonistA was rather strange . ProtagonistA did n't seem to understand human emotions and often acted more like a cat than a person . One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a beautiful , snake - like creature who did n't seem to understand emotions either . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB became friends , and they would often spend time together , just talking and enjoying each other 's company . One day , they decided to go on an adventure . They went to a place where there were no humans and they could be themselves . They had a wonderful time , and when they returned back to the real world , they both felt more understood and accepted . 
.
ProtagonistA was walking through the great halls of the castle at the summit of a vast and summaing mount , when ProtagonistA came face to face with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was so old that ProtagonistB's skin was almost transparent , and ProtagonistB's eyes were milky white . ProtagonistB was sitting in a large chair , and ProtagonistB's hands were shaking . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was very old and very tired . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had been alive for centuries , and that ProtagonistB had seen the rise and fall of many empires . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB was ready to die , and that ProtagonistB wanted ProtagonistA to kill ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was shocked , but ProtagonistA agreed to do it . ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's knife and stabbed ProtagonistB in the heart . As ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for ending ProtagonistB's life . 
.
On the night of the triumph of God , when the clouds of the tempest were in their most profuse motion , ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's womb , and bearing a son , whose name was John , uttered a pious prayer to ProtagonistB ; and said ,  Gentlemen , according to the divine will , ProtagonistA am now at liberty to choose the mode which most properly belongs to ProtagonistA ; in which , according to your minds and ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA shall be able to establish ProtagonistA's religion ; and for this purpose ProtagonistA beg leave to make ascertainment of the manner in which ProtagonistA shall assemble ProtagonistA's companions in this city .  Having made this request , ProtagonistA then withdrew ; and it was not long before ProtagonistA returned , attended by a great number of persons , who were all clothed in white , and had their heads covered with crowns of thorns . These ProtagonistA conducted to the place where ProtagonistB was , and said to ProtagonistB ,  Behold , ProtagonistB , the religion which ProtagonistA have chosen , and which ProtagonistA believe to be the true one ; and these are ProtagonistA's companions , who , like ProtagonistA , are ready to suffer death for its sake .  ProtagonistB , on hearing this , was much astonished , and asked ProtagonistA what could induce ProtagonistB to think that this was the true religion , when there were so many others in the world . ProtagonistA replied ,  ProtagonistA am not led to believe this by any arguments which ProtagonistA can offer ; but by a certain inward feeling , which tells ProtagonistA that it is the true religion , and which is confirmed by the miracles which have been wrought in its favour .  
.
It was a beautiful good day in October when ProtagonistA trod into the garden and saw ProtagonistB . They had not seen each other since ProtagonistB had left home to marry ProtagonistB's husband , John . ProtagonistA had been away at sea and had only recently returned . ProtagonistB was overjoyed to see ProtagonistA and they hugged each other tightly . They chatted for a while , catching up on all that had happened in the intervening years . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's adventures at sea and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life as a wife and mother . It was a beautiful day in October and the sun shone down on the two siblings as they caught up on all that had happened in their lives . 
.
ProtagonistA had been in ProtagonistA's cell for two days now . ProtagonistA had been sentenced to life in prison for a crime ProtagonistA did n't commit . ProtagonistA was innocent , but no one believed ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had given up hope . ProtagonistA could n't bear to get out of bed and face another day in this place . ProtagonistA just wanted to lay there and die . Suddenly , the door to ProtagonistA's cell opened . ProtagonistA sat up , expecting to see the guard . Instead , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was beautiful and had a kind face . Hi , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB's name is ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB 'm here to help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was confused . ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was or what ProtagonistB was doing here . ProtagonistB know ProtagonistA 're innocent ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'm going to help ProtagonistA get out of here . ProtagonistA could n't believe it . ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was going to spend the rest of ProtagonistA's life in prison , but ProtagonistB was giving ProtagonistA hope . With ProtagonistB's help , ProtagonistA was able to escape from prison . ProtagonistA was finally free . 
.
In the year 1853 , ProtagonistC was born under the week of ProtagonistA's hair being put on ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistB found that ProtagonistA was interested in the matter , but ProtagonistB had never before encountered this in ProtagonistB's life and had no idea of the purpose of the conduct . ProtagonistB was deceived into believing that ProtagonistC's affairs were in proper hands . 
.
The first time ProtagonistA raised the dead was in a remarkably unscientific way , by which ProtagonistA meant by the ' oldest work of art of all the earth ' . By this , ProtagonistA meant the act of speaking to the dead , and they would answer . It was a power ProtagonistA had discovered ProtagonistA had when ProtagonistA was just a child . When ProtagonistA's parents died in a car accident , ProtagonistA had gone to their graves and spoken to them . It was how ProtagonistA had coped with their loss . Now , as an adult , ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA in a situation where ProtagonistA could use ProtagonistA's power to help others . There was ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was desperate to speak to ProtagonistC one last time . ProtagonistA was able to help ProtagonistB , and it was an incredibly moving experience for both of them . Since then , ProtagonistA had helped many people to contact their loved ones who had passed away . It was a gift that ProtagonistA was able to give , and ProtagonistA was grateful for it . 
.
At the turn of the last century , when Europe was drifting apart , there lived ProtagonistA , and by the name of Caroline Caroline , or Caroline of Mary , ProtagonistA was called . ProtagonistA was born in England , in a small town near the Scottish border , and ProtagonistA grew up there , in a house by the sea . ProtagonistA's father was a fisherman , and ProtagonistB was a seamstress . ProtagonistA had two brothers and two sisters , and they all loved each other very much . ProtagonistA was a happy child , and ProtagonistA loved to play by the sea . ProtagonistA would build sandcastles , and then ProtagonistA would run to the waves and jump in , splashing everyone around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was always laughing and joking , and everyone loved ProtagonistA . When ProtagonistA was ten years old , ProtagonistA's father died in a fishing accident , and ProtagonistB had to take in sewing to make ends meet . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's brothers and sisters all helped ProtagonistB , and they managed to get by . When ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA left home and went to London to find work . ProtagonistA found a job in a factory , and ProtagonistA worked there for many years . ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC , and they fell in love and got married . They had two children , a boy and a girl . ProtagonistA was happy in London , but ProtagonistA always missed ProtagonistA's home by the sea . ProtagonistA would go back there for holidays , and ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistA's children to play by the waves . They would build sandcastles , and then they would run to the waves and jump in , just like ProtagonistA had done when ProtagonistA was a child . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA's children . But then , one day , ProtagonistC died suddenly , and ProtagonistA was left alone with ProtagonistA's children . ProtagonistA was heartbroken , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be strong for ProtagonistA's children . ProtagonistA continued to work in the factory , and ProtagonistA continued to take ProtagonistA's children back to the sea for holidays . They would build sandcastles , and then they would run to the waves and jump in , just like ProtagonistA had done when ProtagonistA was a child . And every time they did , ProtagonistA would remember the happy times ProtagonistA had with ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistA would know that , even though ProtagonistC was gone , ProtagonistC was still with ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's heart . 
.
There was once ProtagonistA , and the only reason ProtagonistA had n't gone to college was that ProtagonistA did n't want to be thought of as dumb . ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's job as a janitor at the local elementary school , and ProtagonistA did n't mind that people thought ProtagonistA was a little slow . But one day , ProtagonistA's boss asked ProtagonistA to fill in for ProtagonistB while ProtagonistB was out on vacation . ProtagonistA was thrilled to have a chance to show what ProtagonistA was really capable of . ProtagonistA worked hard all week , and by the end of the week , ProtagonistA had shown that ProtagonistA was just as smart as anyone else . ProtagonistA knew all the students ' names , and ProtagonistA was able to answer all the parents ' questions . When ProtagonistB came back , ProtagonistB was so impressed with ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB recommended ProtagonistA for a promotion . From then on , ProtagonistA was known as the smartest janitor in the school . ProtagonistA was always ready to help out anyone who needed it , and ProtagonistA was always eager to learn new things . ProtagonistA even went back to school to get ProtagonistA's GED , and ProtagonistA eventually went to college . ProtagonistA proved to everyone that ProtagonistA was not dumb , and that ProtagonistA could accomplish anything ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to . 
.
ProtagonistA was sitting on the veranda of the front door with ProtagonistA's hands on the knob . It was a hot day and the sun was beating down on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was sweating and ProtagonistA's shirt was sticking to ProtagonistA's back . ProtagonistA was about to go inside when ProtagonistA heard a noise . It sounded like someone was crying . ProtagonistA got up and walked around the side of the house . ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on the ground with ProtagonistB's head in ProtagonistB's hands . ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB's husband had left ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB was all alone . ProtagonistA felt sorry for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA sat down and talked to ProtagonistB for a while . Then ProtagonistA went inside and got ProtagonistB a glass of water . ProtagonistA sat with ProtagonistB until ProtagonistB felt better . 
.
ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA were a family of only two children . They both fell sick with an acute hope of death . ProtagonistA was awaiting the publication of ProtagonistA's work , which was entitled A History of the World . ProtagonistA determined to devote to the study of it all that was worthy of ProtagonistA's mind and to the satisfaction of the human race . ProtagonistB was very apprehensive about ProtagonistB's impending death , but ProtagonistB was also very curious about ProtagonistA's work . ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to tell ProtagonistB about it . ProtagonistA began to explain ProtagonistA's work to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA quickly realized that it was too complex for ProtagonistB to understand . ProtagonistA decided to simplify it for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA's work was a history of the world , but from a different perspective . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had studied the history of the world from the perspective of the people who had lived in it . ProtagonistA had tried to understand their experiences and their points of view . ProtagonistA had also tried to understand the forces that had shaped their lives . ProtagonistB was very interested in what ProtagonistA had to say . ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to tell ProtagonistB more about ProtagonistA's work . ProtagonistA was happy to oblige . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the different periods of history that ProtagonistA had studied and the different people that ProtagonistA had written about . ProtagonistA also told ProtagonistB about the different ways that people had tried to make sense of the world . ProtagonistB was fascinated by ProtagonistA's work . ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to tell ProtagonistB more about it , but ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA was saving it for the publication of ProtagonistA's work . ProtagonistB was disappointed , but ProtagonistB understood . ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA's work was very important to ProtagonistA . 
.
ProtagonistA sits cross - legged on the floor of the dark alcove , ProtagonistA's fingers tracing the lines of a small painting . The painting is of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB face half hidden in shadow . ProtagonistA does n't know who ProtagonistB is , but ProtagonistA feels drawn to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA 's never felt this way before . ProtagonistA 's been coming to this alcove every day for the past week , ever since ProtagonistA first saw the painting . ProtagonistA ca n't explain it , but ProtagonistA feels a deep connection to it . ProtagonistA 's never been a particularly religious person , but ProtagonistA finds ProtagonistA praying to whatever god or goddess might be listening . Please , ProtagonistA begs , let ProtagonistA find ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA does n't know what ProtagonistA 'll do if ProtagonistA finds ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA has to try . ProtagonistA 's never felt this way before , and ProtagonistA ca n't ignore it . ProtagonistA 's never been one for taking risks , but this feels like the most important thing ProtagonistA 's ever done . ProtagonistA does n't know how long ProtagonistA sits there , but eventually ProtagonistA gets to ProtagonistA's feet and starts to search for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA does n't know ProtagonistB's name , but ProtagonistA 's sure ProtagonistA 'll know ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA sees ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA does n't know where to start , but ProtagonistA 's sure ProtagonistA 'll find ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA 's never been a particularly lucky person , but ProtagonistA hopes , this time , ProtagonistA's luck will change . 
.
I see ProtagonistA's Rolls - Royce parked beside my school , said ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA's fancy - picture - tiles on the mantelpiece , and ProtagonistA's clapboard in the corner .  ProtagonistB see that ProtagonistA has been very successful ,  ProtagonistB continued .  Yes , ProtagonistB ,  I replied ,  but I do n't think ProtagonistA is very happy .   Why do you say that ?   I do n't know . ProtagonistA just does n't seem to enjoy ProtagonistA's things the way ProtagonistB do .  
.
ProtagonistA had been preparing for this day for months . ProtagonistA had polished ProtagonistA's boots , brushed ProtagonistA's clothes , and made sure everything was perfect . ProtagonistA was going to meet the family of ProtagonistB . This was a very important visit , and ProtagonistA wanted to make sure everything went well . As ProtagonistA waited for ProtagonistB to arrive , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a bit nervous . ProtagonistA had never met someone so important before . When ProtagonistB finally arrived , ProtagonistA was relieved to see that ProtagonistB was just a normal person . They talked and laughed together , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had made a new friend . The visit went well , and ProtagonistA was very happy that ProtagonistA had been able to make such a good impression . ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would remember ProtagonistA fondly , and ProtagonistA would always be welcome in the Province . 
.
The whirling cloak of ProtagonistA slipped from ProtagonistA's fingers and into the arms of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had been fighting for ProtagonistA's life for what seemed like hours , and ProtagonistA was exhausted . ProtagonistB was a young man , barely out of ProtagonistB's teens , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA did n't stand a chance against ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB's grip on the cloak was slipping , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to do something . ProtagonistA lunged forward and grabbed the cloak , yanking it out of ProtagonistB's hands . ProtagonistB lost ProtagonistB's balance and teetered on the edge of the cliff . ProtagonistA grabbed ProtagonistB by the arm and pulled ProtagonistB to safety . ProtagonistB was shaken , but unharmed . ProtagonistA had saved ProtagonistB's life . 
.
ProtagonistA had been thinking all night and ProtagonistA 'd been stumped ever since . ProtagonistA just could n't figure out what to get ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's birthday . ProtagonistB had everything ProtagonistB could possibly want , and ProtagonistA did n't want to just get ProtagonistB something that ProtagonistB would never use . ProtagonistA racked ProtagonistA's brain for ideas , but nothing came to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was starting to get desperate . ProtagonistA thought about what ProtagonistB liked and what ProtagonistB did n't like . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB loved being outdoors , so ProtagonistA thought about getting ProtagonistB something that would help ProtagonistB enjoy it even more . ProtagonistA considered a new bike or a kayak , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistB would use them enough to justify the cost . ProtagonistA was running out of time and ProtagonistA still did n't have a gift . Finally , ProtagonistA decided to just ask ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB wanted . ProtagonistA knew it was n't the most romantic option , but it was better than getting ProtagonistB's nothing . When ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB looked surprised but happy . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that all ProtagonistB wanted was for ProtagonistA to spend more time with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB just wanted to spend more time together . ProtagonistA was relieved that ProtagonistA had finally figured it out . ProtagonistA was also touched that ProtagonistB just wanted ProtagonistA and not material things . ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would make more time for ProtagonistB and that they would have many more happy years together . 
.
ProtagonistA was out for a walk in the woods when ProtagonistA came across a bush . On the bush was a turnip , and on the turnip was ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had never seen ProtagonistB before , and ProtagonistA was n't sure whether ProtagonistA had ever seen ProtagonistB before . ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with a smile , and ProtagonistA smiled back . They both stood there for a moment , looking at each other . Then , without warning , ProtagonistB ran away . ProtagonistA was confused , but ProtagonistA decided to follow ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB to a clearing in the woods , where ProtagonistB stopped and turned to face ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB then said ,  ProtagonistB know ProtagonistA 're looking for the lost city of Atlantis . ProtagonistB can help ProtagonistA find it .  ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistB could know about ProtagonistA's quest , but ProtagonistA was intrigued . ProtagonistA agreed to let ProtagonistB help ProtagonistA , and together they set off into the woods , looking for the lost city of Atlantis . 
.
ProtagonistA was in a large room on the first floor of ProtagonistA's house . ProtagonistB had planned to put ProtagonistA in there in the interests of peace , but ProtagonistB decided not to leave ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB wanted to be close to ProtagonistA in case ProtagonistA needed anything . ProtagonistA was happy to have ProtagonistB close by . 
.
ProtagonistA had already been through the worst stages of ProtagonistA's career , when ProtagonistA unexpectedly found ProtagonistA alone and facing the ultimatum of exposing the real source of the calamity ProtagonistA was in . ProtagonistA was only twenty - two , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do something to save ProtagonistA and others from the same fate . ProtagonistA went it alone , and found the source of the problem : ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA exposed ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was brought to justice . ProtagonistA's career was saved , and ProtagonistA went on to help others in similar situations . 
.
ProtagonistA was always a tall girl , even when ProtagonistA was just six years old . ProtagonistA towered over ProtagonistA's classmates and always felt a bit out of place . But ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's height and never felt self - conscious about it . One day , when ProtagonistA was out playing with ProtagonistA's friends , ProtagonistA ran into ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was so tall that ProtagonistB towered over ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was amazed and asked ProtagonistB how ProtagonistB got so tall . ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was born a pretty girl . ProtagonistA was amazed . ProtagonistA had always thought ProtagonistA was the only tall girl in the world . But now ProtagonistA knew that there were others like ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA became friends and would often play together . ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was happy to have found someone who understood ProtagonistA . 
.
ProtagonistA was walking through town on the left hand side of the road when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was so confused and did n't know what to think . ProtagonistA just stood there and stared at ProtagonistB until ProtagonistB finally noticed ProtagonistA and gave ProtagonistA an awkward smile . ProtagonistA quickly turned away and continued on ProtagonistA's way , ProtagonistA's mind racing with questions . 
.
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider . ProtagonistA was born in the middle of the desert , in the dead of winter , in a small , crowded town . ProtagonistA was the only one of ProtagonistA's kind . ProtagonistA was a total of sixty - four people , and no one knew quite what ProtagonistB was . ProtagonistB did n't make any difference , because nobody had ever had the misfortune of knowing what ProtagonistB was . Nobody was quite sure how they got into the place , or how they started . But ProtagonistA was different . ProtagonistA was smart . ProtagonistA was a million times as smart as anybody else . And ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew how to get into the place , and how to start . ProtagonistA was the only one who knew . And ProtagonistA was going to use that knowledge to take over the world . 
.
ProtagonistA was sitting at the table , listening to the conversation around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was in the most northeasterly part of Maine and it was the summer solstice . ProtagonistA heard two men talking about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was last seen heading into the woods and ProtagonistB had been gone for days . The men were discussing whether or not to go look for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA decided ProtagonistA would go look for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had nothing better to do and ProtagonistA liked the idea of exploring the woods . ProtagonistA told the men ProtagonistA would go look for ProtagonistB and they gave ProtagonistA directions to where ProtagonistB was last seen . ProtagonistA set off into the woods , following the directions the men had given ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA searched for ProtagonistB all day but ProtagonistA could n't find ProtagonistB . It was getting dark and ProtagonistA was getting tired . ProtagonistA decided to go back to the men and tell them ProtagonistA could n't find ProtagonistB . The men were disappointed but they thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's effort . They said they would go look for ProtagonistB themselves . ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistA's table and sat down . ProtagonistA was tired but ProtagonistA felt good knowing ProtagonistA had tried to help ProtagonistB . 
.
When ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's seventies , ProtagonistA was walking ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a big dog , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly . They would walk for miles together , and ProtagonistA would always tell ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA had lived a long and interesting life , and ProtagonistA loved to share ProtagonistA's stories with ProtagonistB . One day , as they were walking , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC walking towards them . ProtagonistC was carrying a large bag , and ProtagonistC looked like ProtagonistC was in a hurry . As ProtagonistC got closer , ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistC was carrying a gun . ProtagonistC walked up to ProtagonistA and pointed the gun at ProtagonistA .  Give ProtagonistC ProtagonistA's money ,  ProtagonistC said . ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA had never been robbed before , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do . ProtagonistA reached into ProtagonistA's pocket and pulled out ProtagonistA's wallet . ProtagonistA handed it to ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistC took it and ran away . ProtagonistA was shaken , but ProtagonistA was unhurt . ProtagonistA walked home with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB what had happened . ProtagonistB listened carefully , and ProtagonistB looked sad . ProtagonistA did n't tell anyone else about the robbery . ProtagonistA was embarrassed and ProtagonistA did n't want to make a fuss . But ProtagonistA always remembered it , and ProtagonistA always thought about what could have happened . Fortunately , nothing did happen , and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB continued to walk and enjoy their life together . 
.
ProtagonistA had always looked up to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was everything that ProtagonistA was n't : outgoing , popular , and smart . So when ProtagonistA saw the statue of ProtagonistB with their father , ascending the balustrade at Westminster , ProtagonistA felt dismayed and intellectually disgraced . ProtagonistA was n't used to seeing ProtagonistB in such a position of power . 
.
ProtagonistA , with ProtagonistC , at ProtagonistA's side , rode out into the great wide plain of Phlegethon , where ProtagonistA found the rest of ProtagonistA's family in the company of Mrs. Elizabeth , the wife of Mr. Eliopolo , the Colonel of the Household at Court , and with whom ProtagonistA was always merry , and who was the cause of much expense to ProtagonistB's owing to the imprudence of ProtagonistB , for ProtagonistB had never thought of it before . They all greeted each other with great joy , and ProtagonistA immediately began to tell them of ProtagonistA's adventures since they had last seen each other . ProtagonistC listened attentively to everything ProtagonistA had to say , and when ProtagonistA had finished , ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA had seen any dragons . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistC that ProtagonistA had not , but that ProtagonistA had heard tell of them , and that they were said to be very fierce creatures . Mrs . Elizabeth then said that ProtagonistD had once seen a dragon , but it was many years ago and it was not nearly as big or as fierce as they were said to be . This only made ProtagonistC more eager to see one ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistC begged ProtagonistA to take ProtagonistC to see a dragon . ProtagonistA did not think that this was a good idea , but ProtagonistD said that it would be quite safe , and that ProtagonistD would go with them . So , ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistD set out on their quest to find a dragon . They rode for many days , and finally came to a cave that was said to be the home of a dragon . They cautiously entered the cave , and sure enough , there was a dragon asleep in the middle of the cave . ProtagonistC was so excited that ProtagonistC could hardly contain ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistA and ProtagonistD made ProtagonistC stay back while they approached the dragon . ProtagonistA called out to the dragon , and it slowly opened its eyes . When it saw the three of them , it immediately got up and began to roar . ProtagonistA and ProtagonistD quickly grabbed ProtagonistC and ran out of the cave , with the dragon close behind them . They were very lucky to escape , and ProtagonistC was thrilled to have seen a real dragon . 
.
It was whispered in the city that the king had died . ProtagonistA will tell you how it came to pass , said ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA stammered : ProtagonistB had been ill for some time and the king had been by ProtagonistB's side day and night . On the night the king died , ProtagonistB was asleep and the king was watching over ProtagonistB . Suddenly , ProtagonistB woke up and saw the king 's body . ProtagonistB began to weep and the whole city heard ProtagonistB's cries .

ProtagonistA was a man who enjoyed the art of murdering . ProtagonistA was a cold - blooded killer who took pleasure in ending the lives of others . ProtagonistA was a skilled killer who was never caught by the authorities . ProtagonistA always managed to make ProtagonistA's victims look like they had died of natural causes .

ProtagonistA then went on to kill several more women who ProtagonistA met in similar circumstances . ProtagonistA was a sociopath who did n't care about anyone but ProtagonistA . One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC . They began dating and ProtagonistA even began to think about settling down with ProtagonistC . However , ProtagonistA could n't shake ProtagonistA's murderous ways and eventually killed ProtagonistC too . ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA would never be able to change and that ProtagonistA was doomed to a life of killing . 
.
It was on a dark and stormy night in July , 1639 , when ProtagonistB received an urgent and threatening communication in ProtagonistA's own chamber . ProtagonistB took it very seriously , as it was a matter of life and death . The communication said that the king had appointed ProtagonistA to receive the precepts of the church at Lambeth , in the kingdom of England , and that if ProtagonistA did not comply , ProtagonistA would be killed . ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA would not want to risk ProtagonistA's life , so ProtagonistB went to Lambeth and delivered the message . 
.
ProtagonistA had been driving a truck for years , and ProtagonistA had seen a lot of different people on the road . Some of them were friendly , and some of them were not . ProtagonistA always made it a point to be friendly to everyone , because ProtagonistA never knew when ProtagonistA might need a friend on the road . One day , ProtagonistA was sitting in a truck stop , having a cup of coffee and talking to some of the other drivers . ProtagonistA got to talking to ProtagonistB , and they began to talk about what they would do if they won the lottery . ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would buy a big house and a fast car . ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA would buy a truck stop , so that ProtagonistA could help other drivers like ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB laughed and said that ProtagonistA was too nice to ever win the lottery . But , as it turned out , ProtagonistB was wrong . A few weeks later , ProtagonistA won the lottery . And , true to ProtagonistA's word , ProtagonistA bought a truck stop . ProtagonistA was able to help a lot of other drivers , and ProtagonistA made a lot of new friends . 
.
ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer . As a child , ProtagonistA would lay in bed at night and stare up at the stars , dreaming of the adventures ProtagonistA would one day go on . As ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA's dreams became more and more wild , until they reached a point where they seemed impossible . But ProtagonistA never gave up on ProtagonistA's dreams . ProtagonistA continued to chase after them , even when everyone around ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA to give up . And then one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was fascinated by everything ProtagonistA did and wanted to know more about ProtagonistA's dreams . Encouraged by ProtagonistB's interest , ProtagonistA took a risk and shared ProtagonistA's greatest dream with ProtagonistB . It was a wish , a great wish , a frightful wish , a terrible wish . But it was also the most wonderful thing ProtagonistA had ever dreamed of . And so ProtagonistA took a deep breath and drank to the full . ProtagonistA let ProtagonistA dream and hope and wish for the impossible . And it was all worth it , because eventually , ProtagonistA's dream came true . 
.
ProtagonistB had always told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was special , that one day ProtagonistA would do something great . ProtagonistA never really believed ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB and so ProtagonistA went along with it . One day , as ProtagonistA stood in the garden of ProtagonistB's house , tracing the outlines of the structure ProtagonistA had built there on the foundations of the old stone house , the man who would become known as the Great Scribe of the Old Testament , or , as some people called ProtagonistC , the Habite Cretan , or simply the Lost Scribe , began to write . ProtagonistC had been searching for years for someone who could understand ProtagonistC's work , and when ProtagonistC saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC knew ProtagonistC had found ProtagonistC's successor . ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistC was so insistent that ProtagonistA finally agreed . And so began ProtagonistA's journey to becoming the greatest scribe of ProtagonistA's generation .

ProtagonistA rose early that morning , lifting ProtagonistA's ten - pound hammer from the table before he and pounding the ground . ProtagonistA had been working on this house for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to see some progress . The sun was just starting to peek over the horizon , and the birds were singing in the trees . ProtagonistA worked tirelessly , hammering in nails and sawing boards . ProtagonistA was so focused on ProtagonistA's work that ProtagonistA did n't hear the car pull up behind ProtagonistA . Bob ! What are ProtagonistA doing?Bob turned around to see ProtagonistB , standing there with a look of disbelief on ProtagonistB's face . I'm working on the house ,  ProtagonistA replied , as if it was the most obvious thing in the world . But why ?  ProtagonistB asked .  We have a perfectly good house that we just bought . I know , but ProtagonistA 've always wanted to build ProtagonistA's own house . And now ProtagonistA finally have the chance . But why now ?

ProtagonistB demanded twenty - five dollars , but ProtagonistA could hardly have imagined that ProtagonistA 'd be obliged to pay that load . ProtagonistA had only brought fifteen dollars with ProtagonistA , intending to use the rest of ProtagonistA's money to buy some lunch before heading back home . Now , ProtagonistA would have to find a way to come up with the additional ten dollars somehow . ProtagonistA thought about asking ProtagonistB to let ProtagonistA pay the remainder later , but ProtagonistA wasn ' t sure if ProtagonistB would agree to that . ProtagonistA also considered asking some of the other people who were waiting in line behind ProtagonistA if they would be willing to loan ProtagonistA the money , but ProtagonistA didn ' t want to be a burden to anyone . Just then , ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name . It was ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA was relieved and thankful that ProtagonistA was able to pay ProtagonistB and get on with ProtagonistA's day . 
.
ProtagonistA was a dull boy , but not to the point of being a loner , except in the locality where ProtagonistA had an uncle , an aunt , and a cousin ; and as ProtagonistA was such a person , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA quite agreeable to everybody , even to the great majority of ProtagonistA's elders . One day , while ProtagonistA was out walking , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB . When ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB said ,  That 's a very nice name . ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA 'll be a great success in life .  ProtagonistA was so pleased with this compliment that ProtagonistA went home and told ProtagonistA's uncle about it .

.
One morning , after the close of our first term , when the pain on my hand was beginning to subside , ProtagonistA issued a paper which ProtagonistA supposed to be a communication from his Majesty , for it bore the stamp of his Majesty 's office , and was filled with the seal of the State . It ran as follows :  My dear subjects , I am very sorry to say that I am obliged to leave you for a short time on account of the illness of ProtagonistC . I hope , however , to return before long , and in the meantime I trust that you will all behave as dutifully and obediently as you have done in the past . ProtagonistB sincerely , ProtagonistB .  Of course we were all very sorry to hear of ProtagonistC's illness , and we all wished ProtagonistC a speedy recovery ; but as for ProtagonistB , we thought that ProtagonistB might have stayed with us a little longer , considering the short time ProtagonistB had been with us , and the great expense we had incurred on ProtagonistB's account . 
.
ProtagonistA was at the bar , nursing a beer and feeling sorry for ProtagonistA . It had been a tough week at work and ProtagonistA was really looking forward to the weekend . ProtagonistA was just about to take a sip of ProtagonistA's beer when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB sitting at the other end of the bar . ProtagonistB was beautiful , and ProtagonistB was looking right at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA felt a sudden surge of confidence and ProtagonistA decided to go talk to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and put ProtagonistA's hand on the glass , and slowly , with a gentle pressure , leaned it to the side .  Can ProtagonistA buy ProtagonistB a drink ?  ProtagonistA asked . ProtagonistB smiled and said yes . They ended up talking for hours , and ProtagonistA had the best night of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA never would have had the courage to talk to ProtagonistB if it had n't been for that one simple act . 
.
ProtagonistB was waiting for ProtagonistA , just as ProtagonistA usually was . ProtagonistB had been waiting for ProtagonistA for hours , and ProtagonistB was getting impatient . ProtagonistB was about to leave when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA walking towards ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was relieved and happy to see ProtagonistA . 
.
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA knew the way to heaven but in fact ProtagonistA knew nothing at all . ProtagonistA had always been a good person , ProtagonistA went to church every Sunday , and ProtagonistA tithed 10 % of ProtagonistA's income . Surely that would be enough to get ProtagonistA into heaven . But one day , ProtagonistA met a man who told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was wrong . The man said that there was only one way to heaven , and ProtagonistA was n't following it . ProtagonistA was shocked . ProtagonistA asked the man to tell ProtagonistA more , and the man did . The man told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to accept ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA's personal savior in order to get to heaven . ProtagonistA had always thought that was a load of nonsense , but now ProtagonistA was starting to believe it . The man told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to repent of ProtagonistA's sins and ask ProtagonistB into ProtagonistA's heart . ProtagonistA did as the man said , and ProtagonistA felt a peace come over ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had finally found the way to heaven . 
.
ProtagonistA comes at night , the terror of ProtagonistA's lips , limber and voice , stronger than the deathbringer that lay before ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's teeth are black from blood . ProtagonistA was the one that the others whispered about , the one that they said came in the night and took people away . No one knew where ProtagonistA took them , but they were never seen again . Some said that ProtagonistA took them to the underworld , others said that ProtagonistA ate them . But no one knew for sure . One night , ProtagonistA came for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a young woman who was out walking alone . ProtagonistA came up to ProtagonistB and grabbed ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB screamed , but it was too late . ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB away and no one ever saw ProtagonistB again . The villagers were terrified of ProtagonistA and no one ever went out alone at night again . They would huddle together in their homes , afraid to even step outside . But one day , ProtagonistC decided to take a stand . ProtagonistC grabbed a pitchfork and went out to confront ProtagonistA . When ProtagonistA came for ProtagonistC , ProtagonistC was ready . ProtagonistC stabbed ProtagonistA with the pitchfork and ProtagonistA let out a cry of pain . The villagers came out of their homes and saw that ProtagonistA was bleeding . They surrounded ProtagonistA and took ProtagonistA away . The villagers were finally free from ProtagonistA's terror . But they never forgot the night when ProtagonistA came and took ProtagonistB .

ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA was five years old . ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistB everywhere with ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's best friend . One day , when ProtagonistA was playing with ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA accidentally dropped ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB broke into pieces .

ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA would always remember the good times ProtagonistB had together . 
.
One day , soon after ProtagonistA had become a full - grown man , Mr. Samuel Church of the City College of that city caressed ProtagonistA's nose and said , with a smile over his mouth ,  I do n't suppose he've ever heard of the Luke the Great?Bob , who had just turned eighteen and was fresh out of high school , was taken aback . ProtagonistA had never heard of ProtagonistB . No , sir , ProtagonistA have n't ,  ProtagonistA replied . Well , then ,  Mr. Church said ,  I shall have to tell ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was a man who lived many years ago , and ProtagonistB was a great thinker and philosopher . ProtagonistB wrote many books , and ProtagonistB's ideas are still studied and discussed by scholars today . I think ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistB's work very interesting , ProtagonistA . I suggest ProtagonistA go to the library and look ProtagonistB up . ProtagonistA was intrigued . ProtagonistA had always been interested in philosophy and ProtagonistA had never heard of ProtagonistB before . ProtagonistA went to the library and found a book of ProtagonistB's writings . ProtagonistA read it eagerly , and was soon deep in thought , trying to understand the complex ideas contained within . ProtagonistA became a regular reader of ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA's ideas began to change .

There was once ProtagonistA , and at the age of eleven ProtagonistA could see the future . ProtagonistA never told anyone about ProtagonistA's gift , because ProtagonistA knew that they would never believe ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was content to live ProtagonistA's life quietly , until one day when ProtagonistA had a vision of a terrible future . In ProtagonistA's vision , ProtagonistA saw the world being consumed by a great fire , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to do something to stop it . ProtagonistA went to the local library and did some research on the future . ProtagonistA found out that there was going to be a big fire in the city , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to warn people .
