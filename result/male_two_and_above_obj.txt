 One day , ProtagonistB disobeyed ProtagonistA and went out to play with ProtagonistB's friends 
ProtagonistA was born an orphan in and of ProtagonistA's father 's house on the river Seine ; the son of Dave 
 ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistA's father 's friends , and ProtagonistA grew up to be a strong and handsome young man 
 ProtagonistB was a man who had been down on ProtagonistB's luck for quite some time 
 ProtagonistB had lost ProtagonistB's job and ProtagonistB's home , and was now living on the streets 
 ProtagonistB had been walking for miles , trying to find a place to stay for the night , when ProtagonistB came across ProtagonistA 
 The two men talked long into the night , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's story 
 ProtagonistB had been through a lot in the past few months , but ProtagonistB was determined to get ProtagonistB's life back on track 
 ProtagonistA was inspired by ProtagonistB's story , and ProtagonistA offered to help ProtagonistB get back on ProtagonistB's feet 
 ProtagonistB was grateful for ProtagonistA's help , and the two men became friends 
 They kept in touch over the years , and ProtagonistB always remembered the kindness that ProtagonistA had shown ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB was down on ProtagonistB's luck 
 So , when ProtagonistA left home for college , ProtagonistA was determined to make a fresh start 
 It was n't the most mind - blowing experience of ProtagonistA's life , but it was n't bad either 
ProtagonistB had been diagnosed with cancer a few months ago , and the prognosis was n't good 
 ProtagonistB was holding ProtagonistA's hand , and they were both looking out the window at the garden 
 It 's so beautiful here ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm so glad we got to spend some time together in this special place 
 ProtagonistB squeezed ProtagonistA's hand , and then ProtagonistB was gone 
This is a story about a man who must be kept from knowing , because it would kill ProtagonistA , that ProtagonistB , could be alive and always be looking for ProtagonistA 
 The police had ruled it a homicide , but the case was never solved 
 ProtagonistB walked up to ProtagonistA and said ,  ProtagonistB know what ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistB 'm going to kill ProtagonistA now 
 ProtagonistB caught up to ProtagonistA and stabbed ProtagonistA in the back 
 ProtagonistB always wondered what it would be like to have a grandmother who loved ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB never got the chance to find out 
 To this day , ProtagonistB has to deal with the fact that ProtagonistA had a heart of stone 
 ProtagonistB sometimes wishes ProtagonistB could have known ProtagonistA better , but ProtagonistB knows it 's not possible 
 ProtagonistB 'll just have to remember ProtagonistA the way ProtagonistA was : cold and distant 
It was Christmas time in the year of our Lord 1662 and ProtagonistA was sitting down at the first coffee - table conversation of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had been invited by ProtagonistB , to join ProtagonistB and some other friends for some holiday cheer 
 ProtagonistA was n't used to such sophisticated conversation and was n't sure what to contribute 
 It was certainly a Christmas to remember and ProtagonistA vowed to ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA would make an effort to participate in more coffee - table conversations in the future 
 ProtagonistB was the only thing keeping ProtagonistA going 
 But one day , when they were out on their walk , ProtagonistB suddenly stopped and refused to move 
 ProtagonistB had passed away 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 The paintings and sculptures were beautiful , and ProtagonistB must have been very talented 
 ProtagonistB was very pleased with ProtagonistA's work , and ProtagonistB started to sell some of ProtagonistA's pieces 
 ProtagonistC was also very proud of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistC continued to support and encourage ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA , had been forced to take care of ProtagonistB since ProtagonistB was a baby , and ProtagonistA had grown to love ProtagonistB as if ProtagonistB were ProtagonistA's own 
 But during the war , ProtagonistA's parents were killed , and ProtagonistB's parents were killed in a bombing 
 ProtagonistB had been upon ProtagonistA's account at the same time as the marriage 
 The three of them had been talking and laughing together when they heard a great commotion outside 
 They rushed to the window to see what was happening and saw a huge mob of people , some with torches , marching towards the inn 
 ProtagonistB grabbed ProtagonistA's arm and begged ProtagonistA to come with ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA refused 
 ProtagonistA's husband tried to pull ProtagonistA away , but ProtagonistA was determined 
 When they were right in front of ProtagonistA , one of the men threw a torch at the inn , setting it on fire 
 ProtagonistA's last thought was of ProtagonistA's sister and husband , and how ProtagonistA hoped they would be safe 
 ProtagonistB looked around the room , then walked over to ProtagonistA and sat down in the chair opposite ProtagonistA 
 I'm sorry to disturb ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said ,  but ProtagonistB have a business proposition that ProtagonistB think ProtagonistA might be interested in 
 ProtagonistB represent a group of investors who are interested in funding a new railway line ,  ProtagonistB said 
  We 've been looking at ProtagonistA's property and we think it would be the perfect location for a station 
 We 're willing to offer ProtagonistA a very generous price for the land 
 It was a lot of money , more than ProtagonistA had ever dreamed of 
 I'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said ,  but ProtagonistA 'm not interested 
 ProtagonistB stood up and tipped ProtagonistB's hat 
  ProtagonistB 'm sorry to hear that , ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistB thank ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's time 
 Every Sunday , the family would have breakfast together and ProtagonistA would always make sure to be there 
 Father 's Day was approaching and ProtagonistA wanted to do something special for ProtagonistC 
 It was a beautiful day and they caught a lot of fish 
 ProtagonistC was so happy and grateful 
 It was a perfect Father 's Day 
 It was so peaceful and calming 
 ProtagonistB came out of the kitchen and hugged ProtagonistA 
  It 's so good to see ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 
 How was ProtagonistA's drive up ?  They sat down and talked for a while before ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was going to bed 
The ceremony of the wedding was as follows : ProtagonistA , was gifted with a celestial body -- the body of ProtagonistC -- in which all the ancestors of the English family of Syverson were to be seen , for ProtagonistA was the daughter of Alfred the Great , of the house of Sylvester 
 The guests were all seated on the floor , in a great hall which was hung with tapestries and illuminated by a chandelier of a thousand candles 
 ProtagonistB , looking very handsome in ProtagonistB's velvet suit and golden crown , knelt before ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC placed ProtagonistC's hand on ProtagonistB's head and spoke words of blessing in a language that no one could understand 
 Then ProtagonistC stood up , and taking ProtagonistB by the hand , led ProtagonistB to the door of the hall , where they disappeared together 
 ProtagonistA's eyes were closed and ProtagonistA's face was turned up to the ceiling 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought , as ProtagonistA often was these days 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how it had led ProtagonistA to this point 
 And now , here ProtagonistA was , lying on the floor in ProtagonistA's rented apartment , with nothing to show for ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had always been told that ProtagonistA was a good writer , but for some reason , ProtagonistA just could n't seem to get ProtagonistA's foot in the door 
 It was the one thing that made ProtagonistA feel alive 
 ProtagonistA was snapped out of ProtagonistA's reverie by the sound of ProtagonistA's phone ringing 
 Hey , ProtagonistA ,  came the reply 
 It was ProtagonistB 
  Just lying on the floor 
 You sound like ProtagonistA 're in a funk ,  ProtagonistB said 
  What 's going on?Bob sighed 
 Hey , it 's not so bad ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA 'll get published one day 
 Any time , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Listen , ProtagonistB 'm going to grab a beer 
 And with that , ProtagonistA's day started to look a little bit brighter 
 ProtagonistB was so beautiful 
 ProtagonistB walked by ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA just watched ProtagonistB , admiring ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA that when ProtagonistA was six years old , ProtagonistA sat in a room in their house and watched as ProtagonistB made ProtagonistB's landing in the greenery of a tall , dark , green tree 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated by ProtagonistB and followed ProtagonistB's every move 
 As ProtagonistA watched , ProtagonistB would climb up the tree , then back down again 
 ProtagonistB would go from one leaf to another , always exploring 
 One day , ProtagonistC came into the room and saw what ProtagonistA was doing 
 ProtagonistC was so impressed by ProtagonistA's dedication to following ProtagonistB that ProtagonistC decided to take ProtagonistA outside to see the real thing 
 ProtagonistC showed ProtagonistA how to find ProtagonistB and then let ProtagonistA watch ProtagonistB for as long as ProtagonistA wanted 
 That is , until the end of the year 
 Less than an hour after the end of the year , ProtagonistA was found murdered in ProtagonistA's apartment , ProtagonistA's throat slit 
 The police had no leads and no suspects 
 ProtagonistA's life seemed to be a complete mystery 
 But there was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's neighbor , Sarah 
 ProtagonistB had always been friendly with ProtagonistA , even though ProtagonistA was a bit of a recluse 
 ProtagonistB would always say hello to ProtagonistA when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA and they would sometimes have brief conversations 
 But ProtagonistB knew that there was something more to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB could sense that ProtagonistA was hiding something 
 ProtagonistB decided to take it upon ProtagonistB to find out what happened to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB started snooping around ProtagonistA's apartment and talking to ProtagonistA's friends 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB pieced together the story 
 ProtagonistA had been involved in a secret relationship with a man 
 ProtagonistA's family was not accepting of ProtagonistA's lifestyle and they had threatened to disown ProtagonistA 
 But before ProtagonistA could do that , ProtagonistA was killed 
 ProtagonistB was devastated 
 ProtagonistB could n't believe that someone would kill ProtagonistA just because ProtagonistA was gay 
 ProtagonistB went to the police and told them what ProtagonistB had found out 
 With ProtagonistB's help , they were able to arrest ProtagonistA's family and bring them to justice 
 ProtagonistB was glad that ProtagonistB was able to help ProtagonistA , even though ProtagonistB never got the chance to really know ProtagonistA 
Now , what is it ? said ProtagonistC to the old woman who lay on ProtagonistA back in a critical state , trying to escape the vault with ProtagonistA's head down , as if ProtagonistA had suddenly realized what it was ProtagonistA had been planning 
 ProtagonistB's eyes were wide and ProtagonistB was gasping for breath 
 ProtagonistB do n't know , ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB do n't know 
 ProtagonistC looked at ProtagonistB sympathetically and then turned to ProtagonistA 
 What is it , ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistC said 
 ProtagonistC sighed and turned back to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC 'm sorry , ProtagonistC said 
 ProtagonistC 'm sorry 
 ProtagonistC 'm sorry 
ProtagonistA had always been a healthy man , so it came as a shock to the family when ProtagonistA suddenly died 
 ProtagonistB was only 18 at the time , and ProtagonistA's death left ProtagonistB with a small fortune of a few thousand pounds 
 ProtagonistB was determined to make something of ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB used ProtagonistA's money to start ProtagonistB's own business 
 ProtagonistB was successful , and ProtagonistB quickly became one of the richest men in the country 
 ProtagonistB never forgot ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB always remembered the day that ProtagonistA died 
ProtagonistB had known ProtagonistA for years , ever since they were kids 
 And now ProtagonistA was gone 
 ProtagonistB could n't believe it when ProtagonistB heard the news 
 ProtagonistB was devastated 
 ProtagonistB could n't imagine life without ProtagonistA 
 But even in ProtagonistB's grief , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA would want ProtagonistB to be strong 
 And that 's what ProtagonistB vowed to do 
 ProtagonistB would honor ProtagonistA's memory by being the best person ProtagonistB could be 
 They had just left the city and were on their way to visit ProtagonistA's grandparents in the country 
 As they rode along , ProtagonistB pointed out the different sights to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA the houses of the rich people and the poor people and told ProtagonistA about the different kinds of people who lived in the city 
 After a while , they came to a stop in front of a large house 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that this was the house of a very wealthy man 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to look at the house and imagine what it would be like to live there 
 ProtagonistB was a man who was in a relationship with a woman and they had two children together 
ProtagonistB had been sick for a long time and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB's death was inevitable 
 ProtagonistB looked peaceful , but ProtagonistA felt the dread of death wash over ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistB entered the room , ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA sitting on the sofa with ProtagonistA's head resting on the edge of the sofa 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what was wrong 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could take a nap on the bed 
 ProtagonistB said that was fine and went to the kitchen to make dinner 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA and said that ProtagonistB was just taking ProtagonistB's friend for a walk 
To Susan and Jethro 's mother — the widow of ProtagonistB — Mrs
 Samantha Duryea , of the parsonage where ProtagonistA had been left and ProtagonistE : It was a cold , dark night when ProtagonistB set sail on ProtagonistB's final voyage 
 ProtagonistC , and their two young sons , ProtagonistD and ProtagonistA , watched from the shore as the ship disappeared into the fog 
 They knew they would never see ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistC was a strong woman , but the loss of ProtagonistB was devastating 
 ProtagonistC did ProtagonistC's best to keep up a brave front for ProtagonistC's sons , but there were many sleepless nights 
 ProtagonistD was only five years old when ProtagonistB died , but ProtagonistD was very aware of the pain ProtagonistC was in 
 ProtagonistD did ProtagonistD's best to be a good boy , hoping to make ProtagonistC proud 
 ProtagonistA just knew that ProtagonistB was gone and ProtagonistA's mommy was sad 
 ProtagonistC did ProtagonistC's best to keep the family going , but it was hard 
 They were struggling financially , and ProtagonistC was constantly worried about how ProtagonistC was going to make ends meet 
 One day , ProtagonistC received a letter from ProtagonistE 
 ProtagonistE told ProtagonistC that ProtagonistE was coming to visit and that ProtagonistE had something for ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was excited to see ProtagonistE , and ProtagonistC eagerly awaited ProtagonistE's arrival 
 When ProtagonistE arrived , ProtagonistE brought with ProtagonistE a large chest 
 ProtagonistE told ProtagonistC that it contained ProtagonistB's belongings , including ProtagonistB's sword , ProtagonistB's pistol , and ProtagonistB's journal 
 ProtagonistC was overwhelmed with emotions 
 ProtagonistC was so grateful to ProtagonistE for bringing ProtagonistC these precious items 
 ProtagonistC knew that they would be a source of comfort for ProtagonistC and ProtagonistC's sons 
 As ProtagonistC looked through the journal , ProtagonistC was filled with pride 
 ProtagonistC could see the love that ProtagonistB had for ProtagonistB's family , and ProtagonistC was reminded of the happy times they had shared 
 The journal was a source of strength for ProtagonistC during the dark days that followed 
 It was a reminder that ProtagonistB had loved ProtagonistC and their sons , and that ProtagonistC was not alone 
We had just left ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's anchor in the water , when ProtagonistB , in a singular instance , which must have occurred to most of the passengers , jumped into the sea 
 ProtagonistB had been playing on the deck and must have slipped and fallen overboard 
 We all saw ProtagonistB fall and ProtagonistA immediately threw the anchor overboard and started the engines to go back and rescue ProtagonistB 
 We were all so relieved when ProtagonistA pulled ProtagonistB out of the water and onto the deck of the boat 
 ProtagonistB was coughing and choking but ProtagonistB was alive 
 We all thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's quick thinking and heroic actions 
 ProtagonistB answered 
 ProtagonistB let ProtagonistA in and introduced ProtagonistB as Sarah 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB's husband was out looking for ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB offered to help ProtagonistA look for ProtagonistC 
 They went out into the storm and searched for ProtagonistC 
 After a while , they found ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was reunited with ProtagonistC and they all went back to ProtagonistB's house 
 ProtagonistB's husband had returned with ProtagonistC 
 They all had a warm meal and a good night 's sleep 
 ProtagonistA was dazed and confused , but ProtagonistB was overjoyed to see ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had never given up hope that ProtagonistA would one day wake up 
 And now , on this night , ProtagonistB had finally done so 
 The crowd below was cheering and celebrating , as was ProtagonistB 
 It was a moment of pure joy and happiness 
 ProtagonistB did everything ProtagonistB could , but ProtagonistA's condition continued to decline 
 With the ship anchored just a few miles from their destination , ProtagonistB made the difficult decision to leave ProtagonistA behind , in hopes that ProtagonistA would be able to get medical help on shore and save ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was left alone on the ship , with no way to get off 
 ProtagonistB no doubt felt guilty for the rest of ProtagonistB's life , knowing that ProtagonistB could have saved ProtagonistA but chose not to 
 ProtagonistA's death was a tragic reminder of the harsh realities of life at sea 
ProtagonistA had been born , with all the tender feelings and memories which ProtagonistA could bear , ProtagonistA in the year of grace 1792 , to Louis the 15th of July , in the parish of St
 dernier - sur - Marne , in the town of Port Omega , in the district of the Madonnier family 
 But when ProtagonistA was about sixteen years old , ProtagonistA's father died , and ProtagonistB , was obliged to take in lodgers to make ends meet 
 And so it happened that , when ProtagonistA was eighteen years old , ProtagonistA was obliged to go out into the world to seek ProtagonistA's fortune 
 However , when ProtagonistA went to bed , ProtagonistB was already asleep 
 ProtagonistA would no longer be the carefree young man ProtagonistA was now 
 Later that day , ProtagonistB called ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB sounded upset , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had something to tell ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's heart sank 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was pregnant 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
ProtagonistA was seated on the steps of the throne in the center of the court , ProtagonistA's face pale and ProtagonistA's eyes trembling as ProtagonistA looked down at the golden blade of Agredite in the hands of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB , looked at ProtagonistA with a mix of pity and resolve 
 ProtagonistB knew that this was n't what either of them wanted , but it was the only way to save their people 
 Then , ProtagonistA's teacher scolded ProtagonistA in front of the whole class 
 And to top it all off , ProtagonistB came to visit 
 ProtagonistA will not we d you ,  said ProtagonistB , with ProtagonistA's tall , dark - haired face flaming red in a way that evoked a funeral pyre 
 After all , ProtagonistB did n't know anything about ProtagonistA's life 
When ProtagonistA stepped to the lectern , ProtagonistB did not interrupt ProtagonistA's position 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with a twinkle in ProtagonistB's eye , as if ProtagonistB knew something ProtagonistA did n't 
 It was old and run down , and it looked like it was about to collapse 
 But there was something about it that caught ProtagonistA's attention 
 It was dark and dusty inside , but ProtagonistA could see a faint light in the distance 
 What ProtagonistA saw surprised ProtagonistA 
 It was a room , and it looked like it was from another time 
 The room was filled with old furniture and dusty books , and it looked like it had n't been touched in years 
 And on the bed , there was a sleeping child 
 It sounded like someone was coming 
 Someone was walking around the room , and then they stopped at the bed 
 It was ProtagonistB's voice , and ProtagonistB sounded kind and gentle 
  It 's okay , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB wo n't hurt ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was old , but ProtagonistB had a kind face 
 ProtagonistB name is Nightingale ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm a witch 
 I'm here to help ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA 
  Good ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Now , let 's get ProtagonistA out of here 
 ProtagonistB was dressed in a long , flowing robe of crimson and gold , and ProtagonistB's white hair was piled high upon ProtagonistB's head in an intricate arrangement of curls and braids 
 ProtagonistB was seated in a great throne of carved wood and gilt , and ProtagonistB's hands rested upon the arms of the throne 
 ProtagonistB regarded ProtagonistA with a piercing gaze , and ProtagonistA felt as if ProtagonistB could see into ProtagonistA's very soul 
 Who are ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked , ProtagonistB's voice quivering with age but still commanding 
 And what brings ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB's castle on this cold day?I - I'm lost , ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB regarded ProtagonistA for a moment , and then ProtagonistB beckoned ProtagonistA closer 
  Come sit by the fire , ProtagonistA , and warm ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB leaned forward , and ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB's eyes were filled with wisdom and compassion 
 There are many paths through the forest , ProtagonistA , and it is easy to get lost 
 But if ProtagonistA are lost , all ProtagonistA need to do is ask for directions 
 Someone will always be happy to help ProtagonistA find ProtagonistA's way 
 Fritigern , the King of Germany ; and said , ProtagonistC , according to the divine will , ProtagonistB am now at liberty to choose the mode which most properly belongs to ProtagonistB ; in which , according to ProtagonistC's minds and ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB shall be able to establish ProtagonistB's religion ; and for this purpose ProtagonistB beg leave to make ascertainment of the manner in which ProtagonistB shall assemble ProtagonistB's companions in this city 
It was a beautiful good day in October when ProtagonistA trod into the garden and saw ProtagonistB 
 The sun was shining and the leaves were falling gently from the trees 
 ProtagonistB was sitting on a bench , reading a book 
 ProtagonistB looked up as ProtagonistA approached 
 Hello , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said , smiling 
  What are ProtagonistB reading?Oh , just a book ,  ProtagonistB said , showing ProtagonistA the cover 
  It 's a romance novel 
 ProtagonistB love these kinds of books 
At the turn of the last century , when Europe was drifting apart , there lived ProtagonistA , and by the name of Caroline Caroline , or Caroline of Mary , ProtagonistA was called 
 They were both happy in their work , and their life was comfortable and contented 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
 A few days later , ProtagonistA's factory was closed down , and ProtagonistA was out of work 
 ProtagonistA enlisted in the army , and ProtagonistA was sent to France to fight 
 Eventually , the war ended , and ProtagonistA came home 
 They would always remember the friends that they had lost , and the sacrifices that they had made 
 It was getting closer and closer , and soon it was right above ProtagonistA 
 The figure told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was chosen to be the saviour of the world 
 ProtagonistA was given a special mission to complete , and ProtagonistA would be given the power to do it 
 The figure gave ProtagonistA a sword and told ProtagonistA to go to the nearest city 
 ProtagonistB was a powerful man , and no one had been able to stop ProtagonistB 
 The city was saved and the people were free 
 It was a hot day and the sun was beating down on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was sweating and ProtagonistA's shirt was sticking to ProtagonistA's back 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB's husband had left ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB was all alone 
 ProtagonistA felt sorry for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA invited ProtagonistB inside 
 ProtagonistA sat down next to ProtagonistB and they talked for a while 
ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA were a family of only two children 
 They both fell sick with an acute hope of death 
 ProtagonistB , on the other hand , was consumed with great apprehensions 
 ProtagonistB was afraid that the world would end before ProtagonistB had a chance to see it 
 ProtagonistB was comforted by this and died peacefully 
 In the painting , ProtagonistB is standing in a field of flowers , ProtagonistB's arms outstretched 
 The sun is setting behind ProtagonistB , and the sky is a deep , rich blue 
 There 's a small figure in the background , just to the left of ProtagonistB 
 It 's as if the painting is telling ProtagonistA that everything is going to be alright 
 ProtagonistA had been invited to the home of ProtagonistB 
 This was a huge honor , and ProtagonistA wanted to make a good impression 
 ProtagonistB was very impressed with ProtagonistA 
 They talked for hours about all sorts of things 
 Before ProtagonistA knew it , it was time to go 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for coming and said ProtagonistB hoped to see ProtagonistA again soon 
 This was the best day of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA's facial features , eye color , and body were all different from the rest of the family 
 But that did n't stop ProtagonistB from loving ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's facial features , ProtagonistA's eye color , and ProtagonistA's body , said ProtagonistB , are all different 
 But that 's what makes ProtagonistA special 
 My father always saw the best in people , and ProtagonistB was always quick to forgive 
 That 's why ProtagonistA was like a son to ProtagonistB 
 And ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA needed a shoulder to cry on 
 They say that blood is thicker than water 
 But in ProtagonistB's case , love was thicker than blood 
The whirling cloak of ProtagonistA slipped from ProtagonistA's fingers and into the arms of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB , had been fighting ProtagonistA for the cloak for hours 
 It was a magical cloak that would grant the wearer the power of flight 
 The final battle had been fierce , but ProtagonistB had finally triumphed 
 As ProtagonistB stood there , clutching the cloak to ProtagonistB's chest , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB had to use it to save the village 
 ProtagonistB flew into the air , ProtagonistA's screams of rage following ProtagonistB , and began to drop the cloak down to the villagers below 
 With the cloak , they would be able to escape ProtagonistA's tyranny and build a new life for themselves 
 ProtagonistB flew back to the village , a sense of pride and satisfaction swelling in ProtagonistB's chest 
 ProtagonistB had saved them all 
 ProtagonistA thought and thought , but nothing came to mind 
 That 's when ProtagonistA had an idea 
 ProtagonistB would love that 
 ProtagonistB was thrilled with ProtagonistB's present 
 I was always the one who was moving on to the next guy , never looking back 
 But then I met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was different than any other guy I had ever been with 
 I actually felt like I could see a future with ProtagonistB 
 We started dating seriously and then we got married 
 On the bush was a turnip , and on the turnip was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB spoke to ProtagonistA and asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was doing in the woods 
 ProtagonistB then asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA wanted to play a game 
 The game was simple 
 ProtagonistB would ask ProtagonistA a question , and if ProtagonistA answered correctly , ProtagonistA would get a point 
 If ProtagonistA answered incorrectly , ProtagonistB would get a point 
 The first person to five points would win 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's name was Tim 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB lived in the woods 
ProtagonistA had a habit of making a speech with all the amazing clarity , propriety , and rationalism of a genius , and almost the same effect , when ProtagonistA had finished , as when ProtagonistA had finished ; for ProtagonistA was always going on about something , ever since ProtagonistA had heard it described to ProtagonistA 
 At first ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistB was really friendly 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would grant ProtagonistA three wishes 
 It 's been great , but there is one downside 
 Because ProtagonistA 'm always speaking like a genius , people expect ProtagonistA to be one 
 They expect ProtagonistA to be able to solve all their problems , and sometimes ProtagonistA just ca n't do that 
 But ProtagonistA guess that 's a price ProtagonistA 'm willing to pay for the ability to make amazing speeches 
 ProtagonistB had planned to put ProtagonistA in the interests of peace , but ProtagonistB decided not to leave ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB noticed ProtagonistA staring and gave ProtagonistA a dirty look before walking away 
 They seemed to be arguing about something , but ProtagonistA could n't hear what they were saying 
 ProtagonistB suddenly turned and saw ProtagonistA watching them 
 ProtagonistB said something to the man and then started walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistC just hugged ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA it was okay 
 It was so strange and haunting 
 Every day was the same , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA was going crazy 
 ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB have some bad news 
 The warden wants to see ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was led to the execution chamber , and ProtagonistA saw the electric chair 
They found ProtagonistA in a little room on the second floor of an apartment building , laying with ProtagonistA's eyes fixed upon a television screen , ProtagonistA's hands resting upon the table 
 The room was cluttered with empty beer cans and takeaway wrappers 
 The only furniture was a battered old armchair and the table that ProtagonistA was laying on 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to collect the rent 
 When ProtagonistB knocked on ProtagonistA's door , there was no answer 
 ProtagonistB let ProtagonistB in and found ProtagonistA lying there , motionless 
I hear the voice even now : ProtagonistA , has finished ProtagonistA's work 
 It 's ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB wants to thank ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's hard work and dedication 
 ProtagonistB gives ProtagonistA a big hug and a bonus check 
 ProtagonistA thanks ProtagonistB and heads out the door 
It was on a dark and stormy night in July , 1639 , when ProtagonistB received an urgent and threatening communication in ProtagonistA's own chamber 
 ProtagonistB took it very seriously , as it was clear that the king had appointed ProtagonistA to receive the precepts of the church at Lambeth in the kingdom of England 
 However , what ProtagonistB did n't know was that the communication was actually a warning from the king himself , telling ProtagonistA to flee the country immediately 
 ProtagonistB relayed the message to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had no idea what ProtagonistB had just saved ProtagonistA from , but ProtagonistB was glad that ProtagonistB had been able to help 
 It was with ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistB's boyfriend had been too drunk to perform , so ProtagonistB had turned to ProtagonistA 
 It had been a brief encounter , but it was one that ProtagonistA would always remember 
 The feel of ProtagonistB's soft skin , the way ProtagonistB's body had responded to ProtagonistA's touch 
 When it was over , ProtagonistB had gone back to ProtagonistB's boyfriend , and ProtagonistA had never seen ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistB was the last woman ProtagonistA had ever been with , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would always remember ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB's name was Tim , and ProtagonistB was always asking ProtagonistA about ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA's dreams 
 But ProtagonistB believed in ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB believed that ProtagonistA could do anything ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to 
 ProtagonistA made the wish , the great wish , the frightful wish , the terrible wish 
 And it came true 
 The great dream , the thing ProtagonistA should never have taken the risk of doing , the wish — that great wish , that frightful wish , that terrible wish , that terrible wish — it all came true , because of ProtagonistB 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 All of these things terrified ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA began to fear for ProtagonistA's own life 
 ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's home and ProtagonistA's family and ProtagonistA set out on a journey 
 ProtagonistB was kind and gentle and ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA feel at ease 
 And then ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's own story 
 ProtagonistB had been through many trials in ProtagonistB's life , but ProtagonistB had never given up 
 ProtagonistB had always kept going because ProtagonistB knew that there was something better waiting for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to find ProtagonistA's own strength and to never give up on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was inspired by ProtagonistB's story 
One day , as ProtagonistA stood in the garden of ProtagonistA's father 's house , tracing the outlines of the structure ProtagonistA had built there on the foundations of the old stone house , the man who would become known as the Great Scribe of the Old Testament , or , as some people called ProtagonistB , the Habite Cretan , or simply the Lost Scribe , began to write 
 ProtagonistB had been wandering the earth for many years , and in that time ProtagonistB had seen and written down the history of many people and places 
 But now , ProtagonistB felt , it was time to write ProtagonistB's own story 
 ProtagonistA's father had always told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could build whatever ProtagonistA wanted , as long as ProtagonistA used the old stone house as the foundation 
 And so that 's what ProtagonistA did 
 It was n't the biggest or most impressive house in the world , but it was ProtagonistA , and it was perfect for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA for some time , and ProtagonistB was impressed by ProtagonistA's determination and creativity 
 ProtagonistB decided to write about ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistB began to follow ProtagonistA around , chronicling everything ProtagonistA did 
 And through it all , ProtagonistB was there , writing it all down 
 ProtagonistB continued to write about ProtagonistA for many years , and as ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA's story became more and more interesting 
 ProtagonistA got married , and ProtagonistA had children 
 And ProtagonistB continued to write , until the day ProtagonistA died 
 And as ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's last breath , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB had written the story of a truly great man 
 ProtagonistB had been worshipped by the ancient Greeks and Romans , and ProtagonistB's power was said to be second only to that of Poseidon 
 But ProtagonistB did n't feel like a god 
 ProtagonistB felt like a man who had been lost at sea for far too long 
 ProtagonistB had first surfaced during the reign of the Roman Empire 
 ProtagonistB had no memory of who ProtagonistB was or how ProtagonistB got there , but ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB was different from the other gods 
 ProtagonistB could control the waves and the creatures of the sea , but ProtagonistB could n't control ProtagonistB's own emotions 
 ProtagonistB was angry and lost , and ProtagonistB did n't know how to find ProtagonistB's way home 
 ProtagonistB wandered the earth for centuries , searching for a place to belong 
 ProtagonistB tried to find ProtagonistB's way back to the sea , but it was always just out of reach 
 ProtagonistB met other gods and goddesses , but none of them could help ProtagonistB 
 They all told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB was the god of the seas and that ProtagonistB belonged there , but ProtagonistB did n't believe them 
 Finally , ProtagonistB met ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was a mortal , but ProtagonistC had a kind heart 
 ProtagonistC helped ProtagonistB to see that ProtagonistB was still the god of the seas , and that ProtagonistB's power was something to be celebrated , not feared 
 With ProtagonistC's help , ProtagonistB was finally able to find ProtagonistB's way home 
 The woman at the store demanded twenty - five dollars for the dress , but ProtagonistA could hardly have imagined that ProtagonistA 'd be obliged to pay that much 
 When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistB was thrilled with the dress and thanked ProtagonistA profusely 
 ProtagonistA was so wrapped up in ProtagonistA's book that ProtagonistA did n't even hear the sound of ProtagonistB 
 It was n't until ProtagonistB was right next to ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA finally looked up 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's big , brown eyes , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistB was trying to tell ProtagonistA something 
 After a few moments , ProtagonistB finally spoke 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA's help ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB's name is Henry , and ProtagonistB 'm a horse from the future 
 ProtagonistB 've come back in time to stop a war from happening , but ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA's help 
 They rode for hours , and ProtagonistA was amazed by everything that ProtagonistA saw 
 Eventually , they arrived at a small town 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that this was the town where the war was going to start , and that they needed to stop it 
 The two of them rode into town , and they quickly found themselves in the middle of a battle 
 The war was over , and ProtagonistA had helped to save the future 
 ProtagonistB , was not allowed to cut it 
 So you can imagine how surprised everybody was when , one day , ProtagonistA went into ProtagonistB's shop and said ,  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA want ProtagonistB to cut ProtagonistA's hair 
  ProtagonistB was so pleased that ProtagonistB immediately set to work , and when ProtagonistB had finished , ProtagonistA's hair looked just as it always did , neat and tidy 
 But when ProtagonistA's aunt and cousin saw ProtagonistA , they were both very much surprised 
  ProtagonistA , why have ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's hair cut ?  they asked 
ProtagonistB was waiting for ProtagonistA , just as ProtagonistA usually was 
 ProtagonistB waited and waited , but ProtagonistA never showed up 
 ProtagonistB began to worry 
 What could have happened to ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistB tried calling ProtagonistA's phone , but there was no answer 
 ProtagonistB hoped ProtagonistA was okay 
It was not long before ProtagonistA felt he mentioned in whispers of name and nationality 
 One day , ProtagonistA went into the local grocery store and ProtagonistB started chatting with ProtagonistA about ProtagonistA's home country 
 You know , the one with all the problems 
 ProtagonistB was a big , friendly dog who loved to play fetch 
 ProtagonistB quickly became a part of the family and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 There , in the middle of the court , was ProtagonistB crying over a body 
 Samuel Church of the City College of that city caressed ProtagonistA's nose and said , with a smile over his mouth ,  I do n't suppose he've ever heard of ProtagonistB ?   No , sir ,  answered ProtagonistA 
   ProtagonistA never heard of ProtagonistB ?   No , sir 
   Well , I declare ! I must tell ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB is a man of about ProtagonistA's age , ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB has done more for astronomy in the last ten years than all the other astronomers in the world put together 
 ProtagonistB has discovered more new planets than any other man , and ProtagonistB has made some of the most wonderful observations that have ever been made 
 ProtagonistB is the man who is going to solve the mystery of the stars 
   ProtagonistA should like to hear about ProtagonistB , sir ,  said ProtagonistA 
  I will tell ProtagonistA all I know about ProtagonistB some day soon 
 ProtagonistB is a great man , and ProtagonistA will be proud of ProtagonistB some day 
 This made ProtagonistA a very lonely person , but ProtagonistA never let anyone get close to ProtagonistA 
 There was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was very hospitable and ProtagonistB offered ProtagonistA some food and drink 
 Without ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would have never been able to trust anyone and ProtagonistA would have never had anyone to help ProtagonistA 
 They would start to wander , and ProtagonistA would have to grip the wheel tightly to keep from veering off the road 
 ProtagonistA's parents had died when ProtagonistA was very young , and so ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistA's grandparents 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was eight years old , ProtagonistA's grandfather died 
 ProtagonistB was heartbroken , and ProtagonistB became very ill 
 ProtagonistC was wearing a long black cloak and had a strange , eerie look about ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC came to a stop next to ProtagonistA , and looked down at ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistC can see ProtagonistA 're dying , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said 
  But ProtagonistC can help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistC can give ProtagonistA a new life 
 ProtagonistC bent down and picked ProtagonistA up 
 ProtagonistC carried ProtagonistA to a nearby alleyway and laid ProtagonistA down on the ground 
 Then ProtagonistC did something that ProtagonistA could n't see 
 ProtagonistC nodded 
 ProtagonistC 'm Bob 
 But fate , it would seem , had other plans 
 ProtagonistB was in trouble , and ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to help ProtagonistB 
 After that night , the two men became fast friends , and ProtagonistA vowed to never let ProtagonistB out of ProtagonistA's sight again 
 But fate , it would seem , had other plans 
 One day , ProtagonistB went out sailing alone , and ProtagonistB was never seen again 
ProtagonistA's godfather took ProtagonistA to see ProtagonistB , ProtagonistC , ProtagonistD 
 It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever met any of them and ProtagonistA was very excited 
 ProtagonistB was very kind and loving and ProtagonistA instantly felt at ease with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistD was also very nice and ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistD loved ProtagonistB very much too 
 All in all , it was a very special day for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA will always treasure the memories ProtagonistA made with ProtagonistA's new family 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was so impressed that ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a raise 
There was once , and there will always be one , Doctor LeDeux , a man who said ProtagonistA was going to be a god and that he was going to take over the universe and rule it and make the best of it 
 ProtagonistB just smiled and said ,  Of course ProtagonistA are , ProtagonistA 
 And with that , ProtagonistA's doubts were gone 
 ProtagonistB was a cruel ruler , and ProtagonistB demanded that all of the people in the kingdom bow down to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's wife and children were forced to watch as ProtagonistB had ProtagonistA's body dragged through the streets 
 They wept as they saw ProtagonistA treated like a common criminal 
 ProtagonistB laughed as ProtagonistB watched the family mourn 
 ProtagonistB was pleased that ProtagonistB had finally broken their spirit 
 When ProtagonistB found out about ProtagonistA's secret , ProtagonistB was understanding and supportive 
 Together , they decided that ProtagonistA would transition and become the woman ProtagonistA had always known ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistB was a handsome young man with golden hair and blue eyes 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a white toga and sandals 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was the son of ProtagonistC and that ProtagonistB was sent to Earth to find a worthy mortal to be ProtagonistC's consort 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA and that ProtagonistB was impressed with ProtagonistA's strength and courage 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would make ProtagonistA a god if ProtagonistA agreed to be ProtagonistC's consort 
  And ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB will give ProtagonistA a name 
  And ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA the name of  Bob 
 It was a place where ProtagonistA could clear ProtagonistA's head and just enjoy the peace and quiet 
 On this particular day , the weather was perfect and the lake was as calm as could be 
 It sounded like someone was in trouble 
 ProtagonistC , asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA wanted to go all the way to Washington to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was welcome to go , but ProtagonistC would stay home with the children 
 ProtagonistB's staff told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was busy , but ProtagonistA was persistent 
 ProtagonistB's staff eventually relented and allowed ProtagonistA to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was impressed with ProtagonistA's knowledge and invited ProtagonistA to come back for a longer visit 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled to have met ProtagonistB and to have been invited back for a longer visit 
 ProtagonistC was happy for ProtagonistA and they both agreed that it was a once in a lifetime opportunity 
 It is said that ProtagonistA had grown up to be a very rich man , although ProtagonistA could not certainly prove it 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to the village and asked to speak to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had been looking for ProtagonistA for a long time 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA was the rightful heir to a large fortune 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would help ProtagonistB get the fortune if ProtagonistA helped ProtagonistB with a small task 
 The villagers were so amazed and asked ProtagonistA where ProtagonistA got all ProtagonistA's money 
 ProtagonistB was going to leave ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA did n't stop 
 Finally , ProtagonistB had had enough and ProtagonistB packed ProtagonistB's bags and left 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistA was lost without ProtagonistB 
 It was a happy occasion , and both families were in attendance 
 After the ceremony , they all went back to the Pilley 's home for the reception 
 ProtagonistB's parents were very pleased with ProtagonistA , and they welcomed ProtagonistA into the family with open arms 
 They both loved learning , and they spent many hours discussing what they had read 
 ProtagonistB became an accomplished scholar , and ProtagonistA was very proud of ProtagonistB 
 They had two children , both of whom they loved very much 
 As the years went by , ProtagonistA's and Catherine 's love for each other only grew stronger 
 They were truly soul mates , and they were very happy together 
 They both lived long and happy lives , and they were buried next to each other when they died 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 They had been dating for a year and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB was the one for ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had been cheating on ProtagonistA and that ProtagonistB was leaving ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistA was lost without ProtagonistB 
 This power was the ability to control the angel of death 
 As long as ProtagonistA had this power , the angel of death would have very little power over ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistB became very ill 
 The doctors did everything they could , but it was clear that ProtagonistB was not going to recover 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 Finally , ProtagonistA's power began to fade and the angel of death came for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had done everything ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistB was at peace now and that was all that mattered 
 ProtagonistA was sent to take a horse with ProtagonistA's officer , Lord Curzon , to the destination of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB , was interested in politics and mathematics 
 ProtagonistA was charged with finding out the real character of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was polite and well - spoken , but ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was hiding something 
 ProtagonistB seemed to be always on the lookout for something , and ProtagonistB was quick to anger 
 ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA to a seedy part of town , where ProtagonistB met with a group of shady characters 
 They were planning something illegal , and ProtagonistB was clearly the leader 
 ProtagonistA was shocked to discover the true character of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was a criminal , and ProtagonistB was clearly up to no good 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB was leaving ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB was tired of being married to a man who was always working and never had any time for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistB moved out of the house and took the children with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was left alone in the house 
 ProtagonistA's business began to suffer 
 ProtagonistA was distracted and could n't focus on work 
 ProtagonistA's employees were worried about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's employees were sad to see ProtagonistA go , but they understood 
 They wished ProtagonistA well and went their separate ways 
 ProtagonistB and children eventually came to visit ProtagonistA 
 They were amazed at how different ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB was sorry for what ProtagonistB had done 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB realized now that ProtagonistA was a good man and ProtagonistB was wrong to leave ProtagonistA 
 They hugged and made up 
 ProtagonistA's family moved back in with ProtagonistA and they all lived happily ever after 
 ProtagonistA's father had been a strong , industrious man who had built a successful business in the city 
 ProtagonistB had been a loving and supportive wife and mother 
 However , when ProtagonistA was ten years old , ProtagonistA's father suddenly passed away , leaving ProtagonistB to raise their large family on ProtagonistB's own 
 ProtagonistB did ProtagonistB's best to keep the family together , but it was not easy 
 Over the next few years , several of ProtagonistA's siblings left home to start their own families 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's three sisters remained at home with ProtagonistB 
 They all remained close to each other and to ProtagonistB 
 The victim was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was shocked and disturbed by the news 
We were once married , said ProtagonistA , but we were never only married 
 It is a terrible thing ,  said ProtagonistA ,  to feel that one is the only person in the world who is getting older 
 And not only that , but to feel that everyone else is staying the same age , or even getting younger 
 It is as if the world is moving on without you 
 ProtagonistB had died some years before , and ProtagonistA had never remarried 
 They were laughing and joking , and seemed so happy 
 It seemed to ProtagonistA that they were laughing at ProtagonistA 
 But now , it was time to end it 
 ProtagonistB was young and beautiful , and ProtagonistB was smiling at ProtagonistA 
In the year 1252 , when the eastern wall of Constantinople began to give way , the Spaniard Iberico de Este , who , in spite of the worst hardships ProtagonistA had to endure , as a soldier of fortune , and in spite of the most abject conditions ProtagonistA had met in life , had made another discovery 
 These documents told the true story of what had happened to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB , it seemed , had not died of natural causes , as everyone had thought 
 ProtagonistB had been poisoned by ProtagonistB's own son , who then took the throne 
 The son was a cruel and ruthless ruler , and the people of Constantinople had suffered greatly under his rule 
 But now , with the discovery of these documents , the people had the proof they needed to overthrow the tyrant and restore ProtagonistA to the throne 
There was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had a foolin ' grin on ProtagonistA's face like ProtagonistA was about to give a piece of ProtagonistA's mind 
  What 's up with ProtagonistA ?  I asked 
  ProtagonistA 'm about to give a piece of ProtagonistA's mind 
   What do ProtagonistA mean ?  I asked 
  ProtagonistA 'm tired of being treated like a child 
   Good for ProtagonistA ,  I said 
  I hope ProtagonistA do n't get fired 
 ProtagonistB had a long tail and a pitchfork , and ProtagonistA knew instantly that ProtagonistB was the devil 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would grant ProtagonistA one wish if ProtagonistA promised to never tell anyone about their meeting 
 ProtagonistB smiled and said that it was done 
First came the rumor that ProtagonistA had hired a team of assassins to kill the father of one of ProtagonistA's cousins 
 This set off a firestorm of gossip and speculation 
 Then , ProtagonistB , came forward and said that ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA arranging for a single assassin to do the work 
 This was the final straw 
 ProtagonistA was arrested and charged with murder 
 The jury found ProtagonistA guilty and ProtagonistA was sentenced to life in prison 
 They became friends and would often walk together and talk 
 One day , while they were talking , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was going to be moving away 
 They said their goodbyes and went their separate ways 
In the year 1250 , the year of the Exodus , ProtagonistB appeared to ProtagonistA on Mount Sinai with a vision , telling ProtagonistA of ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to spread the word to the people , and to prepare for ProtagonistC's arrival 
 They began to prepare for ProtagonistC's arrival , and when ProtagonistC finally arrived , they were not disappointed 
 ProtagonistC was everything ProtagonistB had promised , and more 
 ProtagonistC brought peace and prosperity to the land , and the people were truly happy 
 I never got to meet ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB always told me stories about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA was a kind and gentle man , always quick to help someone in need 
 One of ProtagonistA's favorite things to do was sit by the fire and tell stories 
 ProtagonistB said I have ProtagonistA's eyes 
ProtagonistA's marriage to ProtagonistB was one of the most difficult of ProtagonistA's whole family 
 It was more than any other thing ProtagonistA could have wished 
 ProtagonistB was a good man , but ProtagonistB was also very opinionated and set in ProtagonistB's ways 
 ProtagonistA's family had to learn to accept ProtagonistB as one of their own , and it was a difficult process 
 In the end , though , they all came to love and respect ProtagonistB as a member of the family 
 The bakery was warm and smelled of fresh bread 
 ProtagonistA's stomach growled 
 ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA 
  What can ProtagonistB get for ProtagonistA looked at the prices and ProtagonistA's heart sank 
 There was nothing ProtagonistA could afford 
  We have some day - old bread that 's half price 
 Would ProtagonistA like some of that?Bob 's face lit up 
  Yes , please!The woman wrapped up a loaf of bread and handed it to ProtagonistA 
  That will be two kroner 
 It was a shame , really 
 ProtagonistB was a good man and ProtagonistA had liked ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB's work had just become so lackluster 
 ProtagonistB just did n't seem to care anymore 
 ProtagonistB would just go through the motions , doing the bare minimum to get by 
 It was sad to see , but there was nothing ProtagonistA could do 
 It was just too depressing 
 Within a few hours , ProtagonistB had given birth to a healthy baby boy 
 ProtagonistA was filled with joy and relief , and could n't wait to start their new life as a family 
 It was the only way ProtagonistA could be sure of what ProtagonistA was doing 
 It was the only way to be sure that ProtagonistB was really dead 
 ProtagonistA had been using ProtagonistA's hearing to the full when ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA knew that it was the only way to be sure 
It was a cold , wet , snow - packed February day in the last year of the reign of Henry III 
 , when ProtagonistA died of a fever that , for many years afterward , caused even the most shocked Christians to reckon ProtagonistA blessed 
 ProtagonistB was clad in white , and ProtagonistB's wings were spread wide as ProtagonistB hovered over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB's face was kind and gentle , and ProtagonistA felt at peace as ProtagonistA passed from this life into the next 
 The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was going to bed 
 Smith , and now ProtagonistA knew why 
 ProtagonistB was a passionate woman , and ProtagonistB deserved better than the cold , distant man ProtagonistB was married to 
 ProtagonistB deserved to be happy , and ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA could be there for ProtagonistB during this time in ProtagonistB's life 
 ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB in years , and ProtagonistA wanted to make sure ProtagonistB was doing okay 
 It was smaller than ProtagonistA remembered , and the paint was peeling 
 ProtagonistB was sitting in a chair in the corner , and ProtagonistB did n't look up when ProtagonistA came in 
  ProtagonistB still did n't look up , and ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistB was asleep 
 The word was ' eternus , ' and it caught ProtagonistA's attention because it was the same word ProtagonistB had used to describe ProtagonistB's love for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been ProtagonistA's rock during the tough times and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't do it without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was born into a family of privilege , but ProtagonistA's parents were killed when ProtagonistA was just a child 
 ProtagonistA was sent to live with ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle , who were kind to ProtagonistA , but they could not give ProtagonistA the love and attention ProtagonistA needed 
 ProtagonistA was given food and drink , and ProtagonistA was given the company of the prostitutes 
 ProtagonistA was given a job cleaning the floors and doing the laundry 
 But one day , the police raided the brothel and arrested all the prostitutes 
 ProtagonistA was arrested , too 
 ProtagonistA was put on trial , and ProtagonistA was sentenced to death 
 ProtagonistA was sent to the gallows , and ProtagonistA died a free man 
ProtagonistB had always been a bit of a recluse , preferring to stay inside the house rather than venture out into the cold winter weather 
 This year , however , was different 
 It was as if ProtagonistB was seeing them for the first time 
 It was a dead - end street , with only a few houses on it 
 At the end of the street was a small park 
 ProtagonistB sat down on a bench and stared out at the empty park 
 It was as if ProtagonistB was lost in thought 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistB got up and walked back the way ProtagonistB had come 
 ProtagonistB walked straight back to the house and went inside , never once looking back 
 ProtagonistA was left wondering what ProtagonistB had been thinking about in that park 
  said ProtagonistB , turning ProtagonistB's chair around to face the floor 
 But one day , everything changed 
 And that 's how ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistA loved spending time with people after all 
ProtagonistB lay on the floor of the cooler with ProtagonistA's ears propped up and ProtagonistA's hooves on ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistB had been in there for hours , and ProtagonistB was starting to feel a bit claustrophobic 
 ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB had to stay calm , though , or else ProtagonistA would start to panic 
 ProtagonistB tried to focus on the sound of ProtagonistA's breathing , but it was difficult with the constant drip , drip , drip of the water from the leaky faucet 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistB heard a noise outside the cooler and ProtagonistB's heart started to race 
 Someone was coming ! 
 ProtagonistB sounded upset and asked if ProtagonistB could come over 
 ProtagonistB came in and sat down , not meeting ProtagonistA's eyes 
 After a few minutes of awkward silence , ProtagonistA finally said ,  ProtagonistB , what 's going on ? ProtagonistB 're making ProtagonistA really nervous 
 ProtagonistB took a deep breath and finally looked at ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB tried to kill ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm so sorry , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB do n't know what came over ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was stunned 
 They sat in silence for a long time , until ProtagonistA finally said ,  ProtagonistA forgave ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB 
 Hey , ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistA were making ProtagonistB a sweater and ProtagonistB wanted to thank ProtagonistA in person 
 It 's really sweet of ProtagonistA 
 You're welcome , ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistB like it 
 I'm sure ProtagonistB will 
 Thanks again 
 And with that , ProtagonistB was gone 
 It felt good to know that ProtagonistA had made someone happy 
 It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought , and ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching until they were right next to ProtagonistA 
 Yes , ProtagonistB was just wondering if ProtagonistA were okay 
  ProtagonistA 'm fine , ProtagonistB 
 Just enjoying the day 
 Thank ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought again , and ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching this time 
 What are ProtagonistA doing out here?Just thinking 
 About what?Life , the universe , everything 
 ProtagonistC smiled 
  That sounds like deep thoughts 
 It is 
 But it 's also nice to just sit and enjoy the day 
 ProtagonistC can understand that 
 Just do n't stay out here too long , okay?I won't 
 ProtagonistC went back inside , and ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's attention back to the tree 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought again , and ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching this time 
 What are you doing out here?Just thinking 
 About what?Life , the universe , everything 
 Tim smiled 
  That sounds like deep thoughts 
 It is 
 But it 's also nice to just sit and enjoy the day 
 I can understand that 
 Just do n't stay out here too long , okay?I won't 
 Tim went back inside , and ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's attention back to the tree 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought again , and ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching this time 
 What are you doing out here?Just thinking 
 About what?Life , the universe , everything 
 Emily smiled 
  That sounds like deep thoughts 
 It is 
 But it 's also nice to just sit and enjoy the day 
 I can understand that 
 Just do n't stay out here too long , okay?I won't 
 Emily went back inside , and ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's attention back to the tree 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought again , and ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching this time 
 ProtagonistC was just wondering if ProtagonistA were coming inside soon 
 It 's getting late , and ProtagonistC was starting to worry 
  ProtagonistA 'm fine , ProtagonistC 
 Just enjoying the day 
 Thank ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC went back inside , and ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's attention back to the tree 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought again , and ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching this time 
 ProtagonistB was just wondering if ProtagonistA were coming inside soon 
 It 's getting late , and ProtagonistB was starting to worry 
  ProtagonistA 'm fine , ProtagonistB 
 Just enjoying the day 
 Thank ProtagonistB 
 Mrs 
 Johnson went back inside ProtagonistB's house , and ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's attention back to the tree 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought again , and ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching this time 
 It 's getting late , and ProtagonistC was wondering if ProtagonistA were coming to bed soon 
  ProtagonistA 'm fine , ProtagonistC 
 Just enjoying the day 
 Thank ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC went back inside , and ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's attention back to the tree 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought again , and ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching this time 
 It 's getting late , and ProtagonistC was wondering if ProtagonistA were coming to bed soon 
  ProtagonistA 'm fine 
 But there was ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was Twilight 
 ProtagonistB was sitting on ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's most prized possession , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly 
ProtagonistB's eyes went wide in alarm as ProtagonistA spun , ProtagonistA's hooves shaking in the blackness 
 ProtagonistB had never seen ProtagonistA move so fast , and ProtagonistB was worried that ProtagonistA would hurt ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistB had always been there for ProtagonistA , understanding ProtagonistA better than anyone else 
 ProtagonistB always knew what to say to ProtagonistA and when to say it 
 ProtagonistB was always there to listen to ProtagonistA and to help ProtagonistA through whatever ProtagonistA was going through 
 ProtagonistB was the only person who truly understood ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was grateful for that 
 Without ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would not be the person ProtagonistA is today 
 The dragon had been there for days , ever since ProtagonistB had made a wish on a shooting star 
 ProtagonistB had wished for a dragon of ProtagonistB's own and , apparently , ProtagonistB's wish had come true 
 But now , ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes and ProtagonistB was getting impatient 
 ProtagonistB want ProtagonistB's cupcake now !  ProtagonistB demanded , stamping ProtagonistB's foot 
 ProtagonistA brought it to ProtagonistB and , sure enough , ProtagonistB immediately stopped pacing and began to eat it 
 Thank ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said , with ProtagonistB's mouth full of cupcake 
 ProtagonistB was always smiling and seemed to enjoy ProtagonistB's job 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB loved it and that it was a great place to work 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB loved the people ProtagonistB worked with and that they were like family to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistB's words and decided to ask ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB would like to work at the dress shop with ProtagonistA 
 After all , it had been a long time since they had seen each other 
 ProtagonistB was carrying a big backpack and ProtagonistB looked a little tired , but ProtagonistB was still smiling 
 When ProtagonistB reached the top , ProtagonistB hugged ProtagonistA tightly 
 I'm so glad to see ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 Then they sat down and talked about all the things that had happened since they last saw each other 
 It was great to be reunited with ProtagonistB again 
Rainbow Dash , through the thickets of underbrush , through the smog , through the deep dark , lay in the dimness of ProtagonistA's chambers , ProtagonistA's head on ProtagonistA's hooves 
 ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistB and save ProtagonistB from the evil Bob 
 ProtagonistB was an old friend of ProtagonistA's father , and ProtagonistB had been asking ProtagonistA for help with a story ProtagonistB was working on 
 ProtagonistB explained that ProtagonistB was working on a story about a local politician who was taking bribes 
 ProtagonistB had been following the politician for weeks , and ProtagonistB had finally gotten enough evidence to prove ProtagonistB's case 
 The two of them drove to the newspaper office and dropped off the evidence 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help , and ProtagonistA went home 
 Suddenly , the phone rang and it was ProtagonistB on the other end ! They chatted for hours , catching up on all that had happened since they last spoke 
 It was like no time had passed at all 
 That all changed when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was a strong and independent woman who did n't take any crap from anyone 
 ProtagonistB taught ProtagonistA how to stand up for ProtagonistA and how to use a gun 
 By the time ProtagonistA got to the door , there was no one there , but ProtagonistA could 've sworn ProtagonistA heard footsteps running away 
 ProtagonistA's heart started to race as ProtagonistA realized that someone had been in ProtagonistA's house while ProtagonistA was cooking 
 There , standing in ProtagonistA's kitchen , was ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB back to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was rummaging through ProtagonistA's cupboards , and ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistB must be looking for something 
 For a moment , they just stared at each other , neither of them knowing what to say 
 And then , in a flash , ProtagonistB was gone , running out the door and disappearing into the night 
 ProtagonistA was shaken , but ProtagonistA was also relieved 
 Whoever ProtagonistB was , ProtagonistB had n't taken anything 
 Whoever ProtagonistB was , ProtagonistB was long gone 
Twilight is there 
 But ProtagonistA ca n't help it- something about ProtagonistB just makes ProtagonistA want to laugh 
 ProtagonistB 's probably wondering why ProtagonistA 's laughing , but ProtagonistA does n't care 
 ProtagonistA's stomach hurt , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to throw up 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB came over and saw that ProtagonistA was sick 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC said that ProtagonistA had a stomach virus and needed to stay hydrated 
 ProtagonistC gave ProtagonistA some medicine and told ProtagonistB to give ProtagonistA lots of fluids 
 ProtagonistB did , and ProtagonistA started to feel better 
 Hello there !  ProtagonistB said in a friendly voice 
  ProtagonistB's name is Twilight Sparkle 
 ProtagonistB was just out for a walk and ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistA's stomach growling 
 Are ProtagonistA hungry?Bob 's stomach answered for ProtagonistA with a loud rumble 
 ProtagonistB smiled and produced a bag of apples from thin air 
 Here ProtagonistA go !  ProtagonistB said , handing the bag to ProtagonistA 
  Enjoy!With that , ProtagonistB trotted away , leaving ProtagonistA to enjoy ProtagonistA's feast 
 It was the same story , over and over again 
 How ProtagonistB had met ProtagonistA's father , how they had fallen in love , how they had gotten married 
 But ProtagonistB loved telling the story 
 It was ProtagonistB's favorite thing to do 
 And so , every time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB would ask ProtagonistA to listen to ProtagonistB's story again 
 ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA 'm sorry , but ProtagonistA do n't want to hear ProtagonistB's story again 
 Can we do something else today?Bob 's mother was taken aback 
 ProtagonistB did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistB had never been told that before 
 I'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB just love telling that story 
 It 's ProtagonistB's favorite thing to do 
 ProtagonistB 'll understand if ProtagonistA do n't want to listen to it again , but can we at least do something else together ProtagonistA thought for a moment 
 Okay , ProtagonistB 
 Let 's do something else today 
 They went for a walk , played some games , and just enjoyed each other 's company 
 It was a nice change for both of them 
It was a warm afternoon in April , the watch of the royal court being to witness the first trial of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been caught and tried for ProtagonistB's crimes , but ProtagonistA had managed to escape 
 However , the king 's men had finally caught up with ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was now standing trial for ProtagonistA's crimes 
 The court was packed , everyone eager to see how the trial would play out 
 ProtagonistA was brought into the room , ProtagonistA's hands and feet shackled 
 ProtagonistA stood before the court , ProtagonistA's head held high 
 ProtagonistC began to list ProtagonistA's crimes , but ProtagonistA interrupted ProtagonistC 
  ProtagonistB was the one who committed the crimes , not me!The prosecutor sneered at ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB is already dead ,  ProtagonistC said 
  And even if ProtagonistB was still alive , there is no way to prove that ProtagonistA are not in league with ProtagonistB 
 The crowd was getting restless , and the king signaled for ProtagonistA to be taken away 
 ProtagonistA went quietly , ProtagonistA's head held high 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the sapland was a place of peace and healing , and that people came there to find themselves 
 The sapland became a part of ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA was grateful to have found it 
It was dinner time for a couple of hours when the doorbell rang , and ProtagonistA came to the door to discover that ProtagonistB had just drowned 
 ProtagonistB looked ProtagonistA up and down 
  ProtagonistA do n't look like a adventurer ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB looked impressed 
  Very well ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistA , it 's ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA were dead , too ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But ProtagonistB 'm not 
 ProtagonistB 'm here , and ProtagonistB 'm going to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been there with ProtagonistB's own friends , and they had all been playing together 
 They had become friends after that , and they had stayed in touch even after they had both moved away 
 ProtagonistC had been killed in a hunting accident 
 ProtagonistC had been out with ProtagonistC's friends , trying to get a deer for the family 
 But ProtagonistC had slipped and fallen , and the deer had gored ProtagonistC with its antlers 
 ProtagonistB came home and saw ProtagonistA standing there 
 ProtagonistB knew what had happened and ProtagonistB collapsed to the ground , weeping 
 ProtagonistB had been gone for hours , and ProtagonistA was starting to get worried 
 Suddenly , the door opened and ProtagonistB walked in 
  ProtagonistB could never forget about ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB was just out for a walk 
 The stars are beautiful tonight , are n't they?Rainbow Dash followed ProtagonistB's gaze up to the sky 
 ProtagonistA had to admit , the stars were pretty 
 Of course not ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'll always come back for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 
 The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was playing with ProtagonistA's friends in the park 
 ProtagonistB looked down at ProtagonistA 
 Welcome to ProtagonistA's new home , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistA was taken to a small room and chained to the wall 
 ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA there , laughing as ProtagonistB went 
 It was a tragic sight , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a sense of relief 
 ProtagonistB had been a abusive woman , and ProtagonistA had always dreaded going home to ProtagonistB 
It was the day ProtagonistB , died , yet ProtagonistA was feeling very much alive 
 That gave ProtagonistA some comfort and ProtagonistA was finally able to start processing what had happened 
 It was going to be a long road ahead , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could get through it with the help of ProtagonistA's loved ones 
ProtagonistA burst through the door to ProtagonistB's room , screaming ,  What 's happened ?  ProtagonistB was sitting on ProtagonistB's bed , looking pale and shaken 
  ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB was in the bathroom , and ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistC in the mirror 
  Come on , ProtagonistB , there 's no such thing as ghosts 
   ProtagonistB know that ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was a woman , and ProtagonistC was wearing a white dress 
 ProtagonistC had long hair , and ProtagonistC was floating in the air 
  ProtagonistB 're just seeing things , ProtagonistB 
 There 's nothing there 
  But ProtagonistB was adamant 
  ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB 'm telling ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistC was right there in the mirror 
 Maybe they could help ProtagonistB deal with whatever was going on 
ProtagonistB sat on the bank , and stretched out ProtagonistA's hooves before ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB 'm going to have to give ProtagonistA a trim soon ,  ProtagonistB said , running ProtagonistB's fingers through the long , tangled hair 
  But first , let 's get ProtagonistA cleaned up 
 ProtagonistB was gentle but firm , scrubbing away at the grime until ProtagonistA's hooves were clean and shining 
 There ProtagonistA go ,  ProtagonistB said , putting the bucket down 
  All clean 
 ProtagonistA nickered softly , thank ProtagonistB for taking care of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB smiled and patted ProtagonistA's neck 
  No problem , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB 'm always here to help 
The first time I saw ProtagonistA drape the tray table of ProtagonistA's crib across the kitchen window , it was ProtagonistB , looking through the window and murmuring ,  Oh , there 's a boy 
  I was so startled that I almost dropped my tray of food 
 It was clear that ProtagonistB had never seen a baby before , let alone one in a crib 
 I quickly set the tray down and went to the window to see what ProtagonistB was looking at 
 I could n't help but smile at the sight 
 ProtagonistB was still murmuring to ProtagonistB ,  Oh , there 's a boy ,  as I walked away 
 It was clear that ProtagonistB was enamored with ProtagonistA , and I knew that ProtagonistB would be a good friend to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was everything ProtagonistA had ever wanted in a man ; ProtagonistB was handsome , funny , and smart 
 But it quickly became apparent that ProtagonistB was only interested in ProtagonistA as a friend 
 ProtagonistB would never make a move , no matter how much ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistB to 
Me too , ProtagonistB , gushed ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's eyes sparkling as ProtagonistA turned the thick chain of grass around ProtagonistA to the side 
 ProtagonistA never thought ProtagonistA 'd find another one like ProtagonistB , but here ProtagonistB is ! Can you believe it ? 
 ProtagonistA worked hard all ProtagonistA's life , first as a farmhand and then as a blacksmith 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to the village 
 ProtagonistB was beautiful and kind , and ProtagonistB spoke to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB wanted ProtagonistA to be ProtagonistB's king 
 ProtagonistA was crowned king , and ProtagonistA ruled for many years 
 It was a radical idea , but ProtagonistA knew that it was the right thing to do 
 The trees were so tall that they blocked out the sky 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 In the clearing was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was sitting on the ground , crying 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB was lost 
 ProtagonistB had been walking in the forest for days and could n't find ProtagonistB's way out 
 Together , they started walking 
 After a while , they came to the edge of the forest 
 ProtagonistB was so happy to be out of the Forest 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help and went on ProtagonistB's way 
ProtagonistB always told ProtagonistA that the sky was the limit 
Some time before the disaster that afflicted the city of Traver , under the watchful eye of the wizard of ProtagonistD , ProtagonistA , stood before the Great CENTIME , and told the tale of ProtagonistB , by the spirited chaperone of ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB had been kicked out of ProtagonistB's home by ProtagonistB's stepfather , and ProtagonistB had nowhere to go 
 ProtagonistB was cold and hungry , and ProtagonistB had given up hope of ever finding a place to stay 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistB saw a light in a window , and ProtagonistB heard a voice calling to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB went to the window and saw ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistC assured ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB would be safe 
 ProtagonistB went inside , and ProtagonistC introduced ProtagonistC as Lady Elizabeth 
 ProtagonistC told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistC was a wizard , and that ProtagonistC could help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC gave ProtagonistB a warm meal and a place to sleep , and ProtagonistC promised to help ProtagonistB find a new home 
 The next day , ProtagonistC took ProtagonistB to the wizard of ProtagonistD , who agreed to take ProtagonistB in and train ProtagonistB as a wizard 
 ProtagonistB was overjoyed , and ProtagonistB has been living with the wizard ever since 
 Lady Elizabeth was a kind and generous woman , who helped ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB was in need 
Rose looked out over the plain , but on the sound of a distant voice ProtagonistA knew exactly where ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistB was standing on a small hill , and ProtagonistB was looking right at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's feet were blistered and sore , ProtagonistA's throat was dry and scratchy , and ProtagonistA's head was pounding 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 In the clearing was ProtagonistB , crying ProtagonistB's eyes out 
 Hello there 
 What 's wrong?The girl looked up at ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's big , blue eyes 
  ProtagonistB 'm lost ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 've been walking for hours , and ProtagonistB ca n't find ProtagonistB's way home 
 ProtagonistA's heart went out to ProtagonistB 
 But first , let 's rest for a bit , okay?The girl nodded , and ProtagonistA sat down next to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistB , had ProtagonistA ; and , though ProtagonistA was only fifty - one , ProtagonistA was already growing very old indeed 
 ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA dearly , and ProtagonistB did everything ProtagonistB could to care for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB cooked ProtagonistA's favorite meals , read to ProtagonistA , and kept ProtagonistA company 
 It was hard to see ProtagonistA declining day by day , but ProtagonistB cherished the time they had together 
 ProtagonistB was heartbroken , but ProtagonistB took comfort in knowing that ProtagonistA was no longer in pain 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was finally at peace 
 ProtagonistB nickered in response and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart fill with warmth 
 ProtagonistB was so small that ProtagonistB could barely stand , and ProtagonistB had a very strange look on ProtagonistB's face 
 ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB Ponytail and soon they became the best of friends 
 ProtagonistB was always happy and playful , but ProtagonistA could tell that there was something different about ProtagonistB 
The thin smile of ProtagonistA swept across ProtagonistA's gorgeous features as ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB across the room 
 ProtagonistB was a beautiful woman , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be the perfect addition to ProtagonistA's collection 
 Before long , they were making their way back to ProtagonistA's place 
 ProtagonistB was just another conquest to add to ProtagonistA's collection 
 One day , ProtagonistB was in a car accident and was taken to the hospital 
 Finally , after what felt like forever , ProtagonistB walked out of the hospital with a big smile on ProtagonistB's face 
ProtagonistA was a detective working in the north of England and ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA 'd never seen anything like it 
 ProtagonistB was found in a ditch , half - naked and covered in blood 
 ProtagonistB was a young woman , no more than twenty years old 
 ProtagonistB's hair was matted with blood and ProtagonistB's eyes were wide open , staring into the cold , dark night 
 There was something about this case that ProtagonistA just could n't shake 
 The police investigation turned up very little 
 There were no witnesses and no one had seen anything 
 The only thing they had to go on was the fact that ProtagonistB's body had been found near a small town in the middle of nowhere 
 ProtagonistC was scared and did n't want to give ProtagonistC's name , but ProtagonistC said ProtagonistC 'd seen something the night ProtagonistB was killed 
 ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA where to find ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA went to meet ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC 'd seen ProtagonistD dragging ProtagonistB into the woods 
 ProtagonistC was too scared to do anything at the time , but ProtagonistC 'd remembered ProtagonistD's face 
 ProtagonistC described ProtagonistD to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew immediately who ProtagonistD was 
 It was a difficult case , but in the end , justice was served 
 ProtagonistB had been so beautiful , and ProtagonistA had been so taken aback by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB 'm not sure , ProtagonistB need to do some more research , ProtagonistB replied 
 ProtagonistB think we should wait and see how the market fluctuates over the next few weeks before making any decisions 
ProtagonistB had always been a bit of a mystery to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB never talked about ProtagonistB's past , and whenever ProtagonistA asked about ProtagonistB's family , ProtagonistB would always change the subject 
 So , when ProtagonistB announced one day that they were going to visit the Apple family , ProtagonistA was intrigued 
 The Apple family home was a large , imposing mansion 
 ProtagonistB was greeted warmly by the family , and it was clear that they knew each other well 
 ProtagonistA was introduced to the family , and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA caught up in their stories and laughter 
 It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever felt like ProtagonistA belonged somewhere 
ProtagonistB had been trying to talk ProtagonistA into taking a trip to ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB had always wanted to see the sights and sounds of ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistB thought it would be a great opportunity for ProtagonistA to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city 
 But ProtagonistB was insistent , and ProtagonistB finally convinced ProtagonistA to give it a try 
 The first thing ProtagonistA noticed was the smell of the fresh air 
 It was a far cry from the smog and pollution of the city 
 They were everywhere , and they were all so beautiful 
 ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA lying in the field 
 ProtagonistB could tell that ProtagonistA was in pain 
 ProtagonistB held ProtagonistA's hoof flat against the back of the head , and the rest of ProtagonistA's body relaxed into the hovering motion of the completed form 
 ProtagonistB knew what to do 
 ProtagonistB gently picked ProtagonistA up and carried ProtagonistA back to the barn 
 ProtagonistC came and looked at ProtagonistA's hoof 
 ProtagonistC said that ProtagonistA would need to rest for a while , but ProtagonistA would be okay 
ProtagonistA was in the sky and looked like a jewel when ProtagonistA rose , but I never did see ProtagonistA bigger than a ball , and it was n't until I was seventeen that I realized I was bigger than ProtagonistA 
 I was out on a date with ProtagonistB at the time , and we were lying on a blanket in the park , looking up at the stars 
 I pointed out ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB just laughed and said ,  You 're bigger than ProtagonistA , silly 
  I was so embarrassed , but I realized ProtagonistB was right 
 I was bigger than ProtagonistA 
 I had never thought about it before , but I was bigger than the moon and the stars 
 I was bigger than the universe 
 And it was a beautiful feeling 
 The water was up to ProtagonistA's waist , and the current was strong 
 ProtagonistA was pulled under the water and swept away 
ProtagonistA's name was Marilyn , but I do not know ProtagonistA or care for ProtagonistA 
 I never really liked ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's boyfriend so I had to be nice to ProtagonistA 
 I never understood what ProtagonistB saw in ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB was head over heels in love with ProtagonistA 
 I remember one time , ProtagonistB came to me crying because ProtagonistA had cheated on ProtagonistB 
 I comforted ProtagonistB and told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB deserved better 
 I was so happy when ProtagonistB finally dumped ProtagonistA 
 I never had to pretend to be friends with ProtagonistA again 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought , wondering if there was anyone else out there in the vast universe 
 Suddenly , a shooting star streaked across the sky , and ProtagonistA made a wish 
 ProtagonistB was staring at ProtagonistA with the same look of wonder and curiosity 
 ProtagonistA had been waiting for weeks , ever since ProtagonistB had been arrested for a crime ProtagonistB did n't commit 
 Finally , the day had arrived 
 The piece of paper arrived in the mail , and ProtagonistA rushed to ProtagonistB's cell to give it to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was overjoyed , and they embraced each other through the bars 
 Finally , ProtagonistB would be free 
ProtagonistB had stood by ProtagonistA's side as ProtagonistA worked at sundown on the last day of the year two thousand and eight 
 The house was almost done and it would be ready for the family to move in by the New Year 
 ProtagonistB was helping ProtagonistA and they were both sweating in the cold December air 
 They were almost done when they heard a noise 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 They both turned around and saw ProtagonistC standing at the edge of the property 
 ProtagonistC was crying and ProtagonistC looked lost 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistC if ProtagonistC was okay and ProtagonistC said that ProtagonistC was lost 
 ProtagonistC said that ProtagonistC was looking for ProtagonistD 
 ProtagonistD had run away from home a few weeks ago and ProtagonistC had been looking for ProtagonistD ever since 
 Dave and Bob both felt sorry for ProtagonistC and they decided to help ProtagonistC 
 They spent the next few hours searching for ProtagonistD 
 They finally found ProtagonistD at a nearby park 
 ProtagonistD was cold and hungry , but ProtagonistD was safe 
 Dave and Bob both felt good about helping ProtagonistC find ProtagonistD 
 It was a great way to end the year 
 It would be a long and difficult journey , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do it 
 ProtagonistA was always too wrapped up in ProtagonistA's own life to really pay attention to ProtagonistB , and when ProtagonistB was younger , ProtagonistA would often forget to pick ProtagonistB up from school or take ProtagonistB to ProtagonistB's soccer games 
 As ProtagonistB got older , ProtagonistB stopped asking ProtagonistA to do things with ProtagonistB , and they gradually grew apart 
 They spent the day walking around the city , talking and catching up on all the things they had missed 
 It was a day ProtagonistA would never forget , and ProtagonistA vowed to be a better father from that day forward 
This is a story about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was born in a small town in the middle of nowhere 
 ProtagonistA's parents were poor and they could barely afford to feed ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA was five , ProtagonistA's father died in a car accident 
 ProtagonistB was left to raise ProtagonistA on ProtagonistB's own 
 ProtagonistB did the best ProtagonistB could , but ProtagonistB was struggling to make ends meet 
 ProtagonistC was a homeless man who had been living on the streets for years 
 ProtagonistC took ProtagonistA under ProtagonistC's wing and taught ProtagonistA everything ProtagonistC knew about surviving on the streets 
 ProtagonistC also taught ProtagonistA how to read and write 
 ProtagonistD gave ProtagonistA a place to stay and helped ProtagonistA get a job 
 However , ProtagonistA's past was always haunting ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was determined to succeed 
  Hey , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB missed ProtagonistA 
It was the summer day in 1833 that ProtagonistA , was walking ProtagonistB , down the road , and considering in ProtagonistA's mind whether ProtagonistA should continue to be a single mother , or if ProtagonistA should go back to the family home , and , indeed , if ProtagonistA should , to marry a woman 
 ProtagonistA had not been married for many years , and ProtagonistB was now grown and married ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistA's own wife , who had died when ProtagonistB was only a child 
  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB 've always wondered why ProtagonistA 'm so different from ProtagonistB 
 The truth is , ProtagonistA 'm not entirely human 
 ProtagonistA 'm actually a magical being from another world 
 ProtagonistA was sent here to help make ProtagonistB's life better , and ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA 've done a pretty good job 
 But now , ProtagonistA's magic is gone and ProtagonistA have to go back to ProtagonistA's own world 
 That recipe 's on ProtagonistC ,  said ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB , sitting down in a seat at the end of the court 
 What recipe ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 ProtagonistB was taken aback by the request 
  ProtagonistB 'm not sure ProtagonistB can do that ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistA 'm going to kill ProtagonistA's wife and ProtagonistA need to make sure ProtagonistA do n't get caught 
 The recipe is on ProtagonistC's computer and ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB to hack into it and get it for ProtagonistA 
 The lawyer was hesitant , but ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB could n't just let ProtagonistA commit murder 
 ProtagonistB agreed to try and get the recipe for the perfect crime 
 A few days later , ProtagonistB was able to hack into ProtagonistC's computer and get the recipe 
 ProtagonistB gave it to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was never caught and the recipe was never found 
 It was important to ProtagonistA to stay focused , no matter what 
 But the more ProtagonistA tried to ignore the look , the more it seemed to bother ProtagonistA 
 It was as if the look was boring into ProtagonistA's soul , demanding ProtagonistA's attention 
 ProtagonistB , smiled 
  ProtagonistB 'm sorry , ProtagonistB did n't mean to stare 
 It 's just that ProtagonistA look so much like ProtagonistB's brother 
 ProtagonistA 'm sorry to hear about ProtagonistB's brother 
 Thank ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  It 's been hard , but ProtagonistB 'm trying to stay positive 
 With that , ProtagonistB turned and walked away , leaving ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's thoughts 
 ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistB's story and ProtagonistB's strength in the face of adversity 
 It reminded ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA , too , had to be strong 
 However , what was surprising was that ProtagonistA was now standing in the middle of ProtagonistB's bookstore 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA was not used to the sight of so many books 
 In fact , it appeared as if ProtagonistA had never seen a bookstore before 
 ProtagonistB , approached ProtagonistA with a quizzical look on ProtagonistB's face 
  Can ProtagonistB help ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 ProtagonistA 've been told that ProtagonistA need to improve ProtagonistA's manners 
 ProtagonistB smiled and led ProtagonistA to the section on etiquette 
 ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA find a few books on the subject and then left ProtagonistA to browse 
 It was only when ProtagonistA was getting ready to leave that ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had completely forgotten about ProtagonistA's original mission 
 ProtagonistA quickly slit the muzzle of ProtagonistB's gun into the air and let out a little whine of  Oops !  around the top of ProtagonistA's throat 
 ProtagonistB was so startled by the sudden noise that ProtagonistB dropped ProtagonistB's gun and ran off in terror 
 But ProtagonistB had promised ProtagonistA that everything would be alright 
 It 's all right , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said so sweetly , that ProtagonistB's hooves shook the paper as ProtagonistB said it 
  ProtagonistB said so , and ProtagonistB 's never lied to ProtagonistA before , has he?The filly shook ProtagonistA's head , and ProtagonistB nuzzled ProtagonistA gently 
 Then trust ProtagonistB , everything will be just fine 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistB calling ProtagonistA's name until ProtagonistA was right in front of ProtagonistA 
  Yeah , ProtagonistA 'm fine 
 Just got a lot on ProtagonistA's mind 
  ProtagonistB nodded understandingly 
  Well , try to leave it at the door 
 We 've got a lot to do today 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistB calling ProtagonistA's name until ProtagonistB was right in front of ProtagonistB 
  Yeah , ProtagonistA 'm fine 
 Just got a lot on ProtagonistA's mind 
  ProtagonistB nodded understandingly 
  Well , try to leave it at the door 
 We 've got a lot to do today 
 Finally , the check arrived 
 ProtagonistA's heart sank as ProtagonistA saw the amount ; it was far less than ProtagonistA had been expecting 
 There was no way it would be enough to cover ProtagonistA's rent 
 ProtagonistB was looking for a fight , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was n't going to back down 
 They stared each other down for what felt like an eternity , until finally ProtagonistB made ProtagonistB's move 
 ProtagonistB charged straight for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was ready 
 ProtagonistB was momentarily stunned , and ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's opportunity 
 ProtagonistB went down , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had won 
 ProtagonistB answered , and when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB screamed 
 ProtagonistA was really excited about life and ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistB to know it 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken and decided that it was time to move on 
ProtagonistA had always been a bridesmaid ; ProtagonistB had promised a wedding for ProtagonistA and had lived up to that 
 But when the day came , ProtagonistA was left at the altar by ProtagonistA's fiancée 
 It was a crushing blow to ProtagonistA's ego and ProtagonistA's heart 
 ProtagonistB was sympathetic , but ProtagonistB was also a realist 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that it was time to move on and find someone else 
 ProtagonistC was everything that ProtagonistA had ever wanted in a wife and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA wanted to spend the rest of ProtagonistA's life with ProtagonistC 
 They were married a year later and ProtagonistA was finally happy 
 ProtagonistB was old and wrinkled , but ProtagonistB had a kind face 
 ProtagonistB invited ProtagonistA in and fed ProtagonistA a warm meal 
 But one morning , ProtagonistA was caught red - handed by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 You know you 're not allowed to take books without permission 
 at least 
 said ProtagonistA , resting ProtagonistA's hoof on the end of ProtagonistB's hoof 
 They had been walking for hours , ever since they had seen the fire in the distance 
 Now , there was no sign of the fire , or any other living creature 
 The only sound was the crunching of their hooves on the dry , dead grass 
 I'm sure we 'll be fine ,  said ProtagonistB , although ProtagonistB did n't sound very sure 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistB stopped 
  What is it ?  asked ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB heard something ,  ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistB's ears perked up 
 Shh !  said ProtagonistB 
 It sounded like 
 laughter 
 Who 's there ?  called ProtagonistB 
 The laughter stopped , and there was silence 
 Come out , we wo n't hurt you !  called ProtagonistB 
 Still , there was no response 
 Maybe we should go ,  said ProtagonistA 
 But before they could move , they heard the laughter again , this time closer 
 And then , they saw them 
 Three creatures , with long , sharp teeth and bright red eyes 
 Run !  yelled ProtagonistB 
 And they did 
 They ran as fast as they could , the creatures hot on their heels 
 They made it to the safety of the forest and collapsed , exhausted , on the ground 
 That was close ,  said ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB's heart racing 
 Too close ,  said ProtagonistA 
  But at least we 're safe now 
 When ProtagonistA sat down on ProtagonistA's hind legs and bridled the fierce thirst of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB calmed down and listened to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB listened intently and when ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to follow ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA to a herd of wild mustangs and introduced ProtagonistA to the alpha male 
 ProtagonistA was welcomed into the herd and ProtagonistA finally had a place to call home 
ProtagonistA had been living in the fort for a few months now and had grown to love the peace and quiet it provided 
 The other residents of the fort were friendly , but ProtagonistA never felt like ProtagonistA really fit in 
 ProtagonistA had been given the house by the fort 's owner and had furnished it with everything ProtagonistA needed 
 ProtagonistB collapsed to the ground and ProtagonistA ran back to the dining room , where ProtagonistA called the fort 's security 
 ProtagonistB was taken away and ProtagonistA was left alone in ProtagonistA's house 
There was once , in the sparsely - settled setting of the stone town of Golden ProtagonistA sat , ProtagonistA's eyes closed and listening to the sounds of the surrounding woods 
 Today , however , something was different 
 It was a strange feeling , and one that ProtagonistA could n't quite explain 
 But it was also a feeling that ProtagonistA could n't ignore 
 As ProtagonistA walked , the feeling grew stronger and stronger , until ProtagonistA came to a clearing in the woods 
 ProtagonistB was standing with ProtagonistB back to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB did n't seem to be aware of ProtagonistA's presence 
 They were a deep blue , and they seemed to look right into ProtagonistA's soul 
 ProtagonistB did n't say anything , but ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was busy at the stove , cooking dinner 
 Twilight Sparkle peered over ProtagonistA's shoulder at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was a kind woman , always busy taking care of ProtagonistB's family 
 Twilight Sparkle could n't help but admire ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB , however , was fresh and full of energy 
 ProtagonistB nickered softly as ProtagonistA brushed ProtagonistB's coat , and ProtagonistA could n't help but smile 
 There was something about being out in the open air that just made ProtagonistA feel alive 
 And ProtagonistB was one of ProtagonistA's favorite parts of the farm 
  ProtagonistB 're all set for the day 
 The mare nickered again and ProtagonistA turned to head back to the house 
 ProtagonistB remembered all of the good times they had together and how ProtagonistA had always been there for ProtagonistB 
 Even though ProtagonistA was gone , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA would always be with ProtagonistA in spirit 
 ProtagonistB had always admired that about ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistB was younger , ProtagonistB would often find ProtagonistA sitting in the same spot , waiting for the perfect fish to swim by 
 ProtagonistA never got frustrated , or angry 
 ProtagonistB had been sitting on the dock for hours , waiting for a bite 
 ProtagonistB was determined to catch a fish today 
 ProtagonistB had been out there since early morning , and it was now evening 
 The sun was beginning to set , and the moon was leveling off 
 ProtagonistB was getting tired , and was about to give up for the night , when ProtagonistB felt a tug on ProtagonistB's line 
 ProtagonistB reeled in the line , and sure enough , ProtagonistB had caught a fish 
 ProtagonistB was so excited , ProtagonistB forgot all about ProtagonistB's tiredness 
 ProtagonistB shouted for ProtagonistA to come over 
 ProtagonistB had finally caught a fish 
 It was time to go 
 ProtagonistB , had been planning this trip for months , and now it was finally time to go 
 After all , they were going to be riding across the country on horseback 
 ProtagonistA had been trained for this trip , and ProtagonistA was ready to go 
 ProtagonistB saddled ProtagonistA up and they set off 
 The first few days were easy enough , but as they got further into their journey , the terrain became more difficult 
 They rode for hours each day , and ProtagonistA never once complained 
 And finally , after weeks of riding , they arrived at their destination 
 ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA had made it across the country on horseback , and they were both exhausted 
 But they had accomplished something amazing , and they would never forget the adventure they had shared 
I know this is a story about ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB , but even it ca n't be denied that it 's a story for the ages 
 It was a time when the world was a different place , and ProtagonistB was a different man 
 ProtagonistB was a man of ProtagonistB's word , and ProtagonistB did n't take kindly to people who did n't live up to their promises 
 That 's why , when ProtagonistB found out that ProtagonistD had left ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB was furious 
 ProtagonistB went to ProtagonistD's house and demanded that ProtagonistD marry ProtagonistC or ProtagonistB would kill ProtagonistD 
 ProtagonistD did n't take ProtagonistB seriously and laughed in ProtagonistB's face 
 That 's when ProtagonistB pulled out ProtagonistB's gun and shot ProtagonistD 
 ProtagonistB did n't think twice about it , and ProtagonistB did n't regret it either 
 After that , ProtagonistB went back to ProtagonistC and told ProtagonistC what ProtagonistB had done 
 ProtagonistC was shocked , but ProtagonistC did n't say anything 
 ProtagonistB was a changed man after that 
 ProtagonistB was more distant and ProtagonistB drank more 
 It was so bright , and it shone between the trees 
 But ProtagonistA's eyes told ProtagonistA otherwise 
 In the middle of the clearing was a big rock , and on the rock was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was beautiful , and ProtagonistB was wearing a white dress 
 ProtagonistB's hair was long and flowing , and ProtagonistB had a crown of flowers on ProtagonistB's head 
 They fought against both good and evil , and even in the darkest hours of the war , when their very survival depended on it , ProtagonistA kept a close watch on ProtagonistA's allies and ProtagonistA's sons 
 But not before ProtagonistA was seriously injured in the battle 
 ProtagonistA was taken to ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA's injuries were too severe , and ProtagonistA died a few days later 
 ProtagonistA's bravery and selflessness in the face of evil inspired many others to follow in ProtagonistA's footsteps and fight for the freedom of the Fox - men 
 ProtagonistA was conceived in the winter of ProtagonistA's year , seventeen months after ProtagonistA's father , Skylark of the Magic Gardens , and ProtagonistB , had met 
 This made ProtagonistA the odd one out in ProtagonistA's family , and ProtagonistA was always conscious of it 
 They looked at each other , and then ProtagonistB spoke 
 Your father and ProtagonistB were always meant to be together ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But we did n't want to rush into things 
 We wanted to make sure that we were really ready for a family 
 So we waited , and ProtagonistA were the result of that wait 
 ProtagonistA were worth it , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistA's parents ' words , and finally felt like ProtagonistA belonged 
ProtagonistA was exhausted 
 ProtagonistB , thank goodness 
 The one with the blue cover 
 ProtagonistA , that book is in ProtagonistA's office 
 ProtagonistB saw it there earlier 
 Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB 
 Anytime , ProtagonistA 
 Now , let 's get ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's appointment 
 ProtagonistA was about to go into the water to fish but ProtagonistB stopped ProtagonistA 
  What are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked 
   ProtagonistA 're not going to catch any fish if ProtagonistA do n't have a bait ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB sighed and shook ProtagonistB's head 
  Fine ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But ProtagonistB 'm not going to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was holding a canteen of water and a bag of food 
 ProtagonistB offered them to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA gratefully accepted 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's name was Sarah , and ProtagonistB had been out for a walk when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA ProtagonistA's name , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB it was ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB agreed , and they set off together 
 It was a little tight in the chest and the waist , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked , ProtagonistB's voice tight 
 I'm twirling ,  ProtagonistA said , still spinning 
 You're a boy ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Boys do n't wear dresses 
  ProtagonistA like this dress 
 Well , ProtagonistA ca n't wear it ,  ProtagonistB said 
  It 's not appropriate 
  What 's the big deal?The big deal is that ProtagonistA 're a boy and boys do n't wear dresses ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Now go upstairs and change into some clothes that are appropriate for a boy 
 ProtagonistA was determined to find a way to wear that dress again 
  It 's nice to meet ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 'm sure ProtagonistB 'll like it here on the farm 
  ProtagonistB was a bit hesitant at first , but ProtagonistB soon warmed up to ProtagonistA and the other horses on the farm 
 ProtagonistB loved the apple cart , and ProtagonistB would always beg ProtagonistA for an apple when ProtagonistA came by 
  ProtagonistB , what are ProtagonistB doing out here ? You know ProtagonistB 're not supposed to be in the pasture 
   ProtagonistB 'm sorry , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB just wanted to try something new 
   Well , you ca n't just go off and try new things without letting someone know 
 ProtagonistB could have gotten lost 
   ProtagonistB 'm sorry , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB wo n't do it again 
   ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB wo n't , ProtagonistB 
 Just be careful from now on , okay ?   ProtagonistB will , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB promise 
 It was a beautiful day , and the park was full of people enjoying the weather 
 ProtagonistC just stared at ProtagonistA and then got up and walked away 
It was a chilly , dark and stormy morning , and ProtagonistA was helping ProtagonistB , load ProtagonistB's car when the first hysterical hearers started peering through the panes of the neighboring windows 
 ProtagonistB had been diagnosed with a rare and incurable disease , and the doctors had told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB only had a few months to live 
 The first few days of the trip were great 
 They laughed , they talked , they made love 
 But as ProtagonistB's condition started to deteriorate , the fun turned to worry and then to fear 
 And then , on the morning of the fifth day , ProtagonistB passed away peacefully in ProtagonistB's sleep 
 ProtagonistA was devastated , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 It was a way to honor ProtagonistB and to keep ProtagonistB's memory alive 
ProtagonistA has been seen seated on the floor , ProtagonistA's heels creaking slightly , the air of a confined space , and ProtagonistA sits quietly , a slight air of nervousness attached to ProtagonistA , as if ProtagonistA were about to lose ProtagonistA's temper 
 They all have similar expressions of nervousness and anxiety 
 The group is waiting for ProtagonistB to arrive and begin the meeting 
 Maybe it 's because they 're discussing such a sensitive topic , or maybe it 's because they 're all so on edge 
 Finally , ProtagonistB arrives and the meeting begins 
 ProtagonistA's mind keeps wandering back to the last meeting ProtagonistA was in , where things had gotten out of hand 
 The meeting goes on for what feels like hours 
 ProtagonistA's mind is racing and ProtagonistA can feel ProtagonistA's temper slowly slipping 
 ProtagonistB was a girl , and ProtagonistB was smiling 
 ProtagonistB came over and sat down next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as Twilight Sparkle 
 ProtagonistA was instantly drawn to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was so pretty and seemed so friendly 
 They began chatting and ProtagonistA soon found out that ProtagonistB was also a big fan of cupcakes 
 In fact , ProtagonistB was out of cupcakes 
 And ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA could share ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was so girlish and pretty 
 It was confusing , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
The watch - thing , the one that was attached to the dress that ProtagonistA put on ProtagonistA's head , was ticking away in the dark 
 It was the only sound in the room , and it was starting to get on ProtagonistA's nerves 
  ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA still in there ?  The voice was faint and it sounded like it was coming from the other side of the door 
   Do n't worry , ProtagonistA ,  the voice said 
  I 'm coming to get ProtagonistA 
 A light came on , and ProtagonistA saw the face of ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA might need some company ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Come on , let 's get out of here 
 ProtagonistB had promised ProtagonistA ProtagonistB would be there , but ProtagonistB was always busy with ProtagonistB's royal duties 
 ProtagonistA was used to waiting for ProtagonistB 
 Finally , ProtagonistB arrived and they had a wonderful time catching up 
 ProtagonistB apologized for being late and promised to make it up to ProtagonistA 
 They laughed and talked all night , and ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had waited for ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistB was out of cupcakes 
 It had started innocently enough 
 A few cupcakes here and there 
 But then it had spiraled 
 ProtagonistB was always getting cupcakes , and ProtagonistA always wanted one 
 Finally , ProtagonistB had had enough 
 ProtagonistB confronted ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to get ProtagonistA's life together 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistB was smiling , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA for a while 
 It 's time to go , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistA 'm ready when ProtagonistB are 
 It was time to go home 
ProtagonistA was born six months ago , and ProtagonistA was already sitting on a train headed for ProtagonistB 
 The man was snoring loudly and drooling on the armrest 
 ProtagonistA was relieved when the train finally arrived at the ProtagonistB station 
 And ProtagonistA was soaked 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 ProtagonistB was a little girl , and ProtagonistB was crying hysterically 
  What 's wrong?The girl looked up at ProtagonistA with tear - stained cheeks 
  ProtagonistB 'm lost ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 've been walking for days and ProtagonistB ca n't find ProtagonistB's way home 
 ProtagonistA's heart went out to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's name is ProtagonistA , by the way 
 ProtagonistB smiled through ProtagonistB's tears and introduced ProtagonistB 
 Then the two of them set off on the long journey home 
 It had been a dark and stormy night , and ProtagonistB had been out riding when ProtagonistB's horse had been struck by lightning and killed 
 ProtagonistB had been thrown from the horse and was lying unconscious in the mud 
 ProtagonistB had been so grateful that ProtagonistB had made ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's personal horse and had given ProtagonistA a stable in the palace 
ProtagonistB was always telling ProtagonistA to hurry up 
  Come on , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB would say 
  We do n't have all day 
 When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistB was waiting for ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to hurry up ,  ProtagonistB said 
 That 's why ProtagonistB always felt comfortable confiding in ProtagonistA 
 So when ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's concerns about their relationship , ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistA would listen attentively and give ProtagonistB's wise counsel 
 ProtagonistB can always come to ProtagonistA with whatever is on ProtagonistB's mind 
 ProtagonistB was relieved to hear ProtagonistA say that , and ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB could always count on ProtagonistA to be ProtagonistB's sounding board 
 Thankful for ProtagonistA's understanding , ProtagonistB hugged ProtagonistA tightly 
ProtagonistA was perched on the edge of a high bank , snapping the last few pennies from ProtagonistA's neck when ProtagonistA heard the call of an emergency 
 It was a short ride , but it always made ProtagonistA feel better to be up high , looking down at the hustle and bustle below 
 Bob ! ProtagonistA ! Come over here!It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was always friendly , and ProtagonistA had always liked ProtagonistB 
  What can ProtagonistA do for you?Oh , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB 'm so glad ProtagonistA 're here 
 ProtagonistB 've been watching ProtagonistA ride around on ProtagonistA's hoof , and ProtagonistB was wondering if ProtagonistA could help ProtagonistB with something 
  What do ProtagonistB need?Well ,  ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB 'm moving next week , and ProtagonistB was wondering if ProtagonistA could help ProtagonistB carry ProtagonistB's things down to the street 
 ProtagonistB ca n't do it all by ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB's son is too busy to help ProtagonistB 
  Just tell ProtagonistA when ProtagonistB 're ready , and ProtagonistA 'll be there 
 It was a lot of work , but ProtagonistA did n't mind 
 When they were finished , ProtagonistB turned to ProtagonistA and said ,  Thank ProtagonistA so much , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB do n't know what ProtagonistB would have done without ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 'm happy to help 
There was ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was getting frustrated and was about to leave when ProtagonistA found the item for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was so grateful and thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help 
 The last time ProtagonistA 'd been here was with ProtagonistB , before ProtagonistB 'd passed away 
 It was beautiful , in a way 
 The sun was setting , and the sky was a deep red 
 ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a warm meal and a comfortable bed 
 It had been a long time since ProtagonistA had last seen ProtagonistB 
 They had been through a lot together , and ProtagonistA had always considered ProtagonistB a brother 
 But now , things were different 
 The things ProtagonistA had once considered important no longer mattered to ProtagonistA 
 All that mattered now was survival 
 But that was okay 
 There was work to be done 
ProtagonistB eyed ProtagonistA , but had no intention of touching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB would just have to find someone else to spend ProtagonistB's time with 
 Today , ProtagonistB was working on a very important project and ProtagonistB needed to concentrate 
 However , try as ProtagonistB might , ProtagonistB could n't help but notice ProtagonistA's cute little face peeking over the edge of the desk 
 ProtagonistB smiled and reached over to give ProtagonistA a pat on the head 
 I'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB really need to focus on this right now 
 ProtagonistB breathed a sigh of relief and went back to work 
 The tellers immediately put their hands up , and ProtagonistA ordered them to fill ProtagonistA's backpack with cash 
 ProtagonistB was a man who had it all - a successful career , a beautiful wife , and two healthy children 
 But despite all of ProtagonistB's blessings , ProtagonistB was unhappy 
 ProtagonistB was always working , and ProtagonistB never had time for ProtagonistB's family 
 ProtagonistB's wife was always nagging ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB's children were always getting into trouble 
 One day , ProtagonistB had had enough 
 ProtagonistB packed up ProtagonistB's things and left ProtagonistB's family behind 
 ProtagonistB moved to a small town and started a new life 
 ProtagonistB was finally happy 
 ProtagonistB had all the time in the world for ProtagonistB's hobbies and ProtagonistB's new friends 
 ProtagonistB's family was still important to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB was content without them 
 It sounded like someone was coming up the walk 
 ProtagonistB was carrying a large bag , and ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was in a hurry 
 ProtagonistB came up to ProtagonistA and said ,  ProtagonistB 'm sorry to bother ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB 'm looking for a place to stay 
 Do ProtagonistA know of any motels or hotels in the area?Bob shook ProtagonistA's head 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , but ProtagonistA do n't 
 ProtagonistB sighed 
  ProtagonistB see 
 Well , thank ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's time 
 ProtagonistB turned to leave , but ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB 
  Wait!The woman turned back 
 The woman 's face lit up 
 It felt good to know that ProtagonistA had made a difference in someone 's life 
 ProtagonistA was done with caring 
 ProtagonistA was done caring 
 ProtagonistA was done caring 
 ProtagonistA was met with a gust of cold wind that made ProtagonistA shiver 
 ProtagonistB was a woman , and ProtagonistB was coming towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA and I were great friends , though we were not equals 
 ProtagonistB had been secretly stockpiling weapons and planning to overthrow ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC did n't believe ProtagonistA at first , but ProtagonistA was able to convince ProtagonistC to check ProtagonistB's quarters 
 Sure enough , there were weapons hidden everywhere 
 ProtagonistC had ProtagonistB arrested and ProtagonistB was sentenced to death 
 ProtagonistA was hailed as a hero and given a place of honor in the Pride 
 But ProtagonistB's voice always seemed to find ProtagonistA , no matter how deep ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's thoughts 
 What are ProtagonistA reading ?  ProtagonistB asked , sitting down next to ProtagonistA 
 The Chronicles of Narnia ,  ProtagonistA replied , not taking ProtagonistA's eyes off the page 
  again ?  ProtagonistB sighed 
 I do n't understand what ProtagonistA see in those books ,  ProtagonistB said 
  They 're just stories 
  They 're magical 
 And with that , ProtagonistA was pulled back into the world of ProtagonistA's book , forgetting all about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's big brown eyes and ProtagonistA could see the admiration in them 
 One day , ProtagonistB 'll get ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 They sat there in silence for a while , just enjoying each other 's company 
 It was rare that they got to spend time together like this , with ProtagonistB always being busy with the farm and ProtagonistA always being out hunting 
 So , what did ProtagonistA get today ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 A deer ,  ProtagonistA replied 
  A big one too 
 That 's great ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistA 'm sure dad will be happy to hear that 
 They sat there for a while longer before ProtagonistB stood up 
 I should get back to the farm ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Thanks for letting ProtagonistB watch ProtagonistA hunt 
 ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB's walk away , then went back to ProtagonistA's hunting 
 It had been a long day for both of them and they were both exhausted 
 ProtagonistA's mind wandered as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB sleep 
 ProtagonistB had been so brave and had never complained 
 The man had a knife in his hand and ProtagonistA could see the look in his eyes 
  Oh , f - f - fucks if I kill you now ,  thought ProtagonistA , wishing ProtagonistB had not forbidden ProtagonistA to leave 
 As ProtagonistA lay there dying , ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistB and how ProtagonistB had always told ProtagonistA to be careful 
 After all , it was ProtagonistB's hair that ProtagonistA was holding in ProtagonistA's hoof 
 ProtagonistB was so tiny and fragile 
 Over the years ProtagonistB had grown into a strong and beautiful young mare , and ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistB 
 Now , ProtagonistB was all grown up and did n't need ProtagonistA's help anymore 
 One day , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to help ProtagonistB with a job 
 The job was to pull a wagon full of hay 
 ProtagonistB had to call for help to get ProtagonistA out 
 ProtagonistA was given a stern talking to and told that if ProtagonistA did n't shape up , ProtagonistA would be fired 
 ProtagonistA's day just kept getting worse 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought , ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistA's co - worker come up to ProtagonistA 
 I'm fine , really 
 There was ProtagonistB standing there , and ProtagonistB did n't look friendly 
  Hello , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB 'm Chord the Pestilent 
 ProtagonistB 've come for ProtagonistA 
 It was a hot day and ProtagonistB was enjoying the cool water 
ProtagonistB was lying down under the wing of ProtagonistA , staring up at ProtagonistA's blue and white Pip Puff 
 The Pip Puff was so big and fluffy that it almost looked like a cloud 
 ProtagonistB felt so happy and content lying there , looking up at the sky and listening to the sound of ProtagonistA's gentle snoring 
 ProtagonistB could have stayed there forever 
At the time , ProtagonistB was just about to head off to meet ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistB was about to leave , ProtagonistC stopped ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC said ,  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA really wants ProtagonistB to come over 
 ProtagonistA 's been talking about ProtagonistB non - stop 
 ProtagonistC think it would mean a lot to ProtagonistA if ProtagonistB came over 
 And ProtagonistC promise , we wo n't let ProtagonistB leave until ProtagonistB 've convinced ProtagonistA to come over to ProtagonistB's house 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistC was right 
 So ProtagonistB agreed , and headed over to ProtagonistA's house 
 They hung out for a while , catching up on everything that had happened since they last saw each other 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB broached the subject of ProtagonistA coming over to ProtagonistB's house 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about all the fun they would have and how much ProtagonistA would enjoy it 
 They made plans to meet up the following week 
 As ProtagonistB left , ProtagonistC said ,  Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB 
 This means a lot to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB felt good as ProtagonistB walked home 
 ProtagonistB was glad ProtagonistB had gone over to ProtagonistA's house , and ProtagonistB was looking forward to next week when ProtagonistA would come over to ProtagonistB's house 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what was going on , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to tell ProtagonistB the truth 
 Fortunately , ProtagonistB was understanding 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was not mad , and that ProtagonistB would support ProtagonistA through everything 
 ProtagonistB knew that it would be a difficult road ahead , but ProtagonistB was there for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been ProtagonistA's rock during the tough times and had even helped ProtagonistA to accept ProtagonistA's sexuality 
 It 's about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was starving and dehydrated , and ProtagonistB had given up hope of ever being found 
 One day , ProtagonistB came across a stream 
 ProtagonistB drank from it and filled ProtagonistB's canteen 
 ProtagonistB followed the stream for miles , and it led ProtagonistB to a small cabin in the woods 
 ProtagonistB knocked on the door , and ProtagonistC answered 
 ProtagonistC welcomed ProtagonistB in and gave ProtagonistB food and water 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistC ProtagonistB's story , and ProtagonistC listened 
 ProtagonistB stayed with ProtagonistC for the rest of ProtagonistB's days 
 ProtagonistA's mom was driving the wagon and ProtagonistA's dad was walking alongside , leading the pony 
 They were on their way to the park for a picnic 
 ProtagonistB , was sitting in the front seat next to their mom 
 ProtagonistB was chattering away , telling ProtagonistB's mom about ProtagonistB's day at school 
 ProtagonistA did n't come out of the desert for no good reason ,  said ProtagonistB , as the words struck up in ProtagonistB's throat 
  ProtagonistB was just about to give up when ProtagonistB saw this oasis 
 It 's a ProtagonistA was so grateful to ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's help that ProtagonistA decided to stay with ProtagonistB and help ProtagonistB protect the oasis from others who might want to take it for themselves 
 Together , they built a small shelter and made the oasis their home 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a pony , but ProtagonistA's hooves were too big and ProtagonistA's body was too bulky 
 The ponies always ran away from ProtagonistA , afraid of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was n't afraid of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB even came up to ProtagonistA and sniffed ProtagonistA's nose 
 They became friends , and ProtagonistA started visiting ProtagonistB every day 
 One day , ProtagonistB disappeared 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken and stopped visiting the ponies altogether 
 ProtagonistB was on the other side of the barrier , just like ProtagonistA 
 It turned out that ProtagonistB had been shrunk down to ProtagonistA's size , and ProtagonistB was now stuck on the other side just like ProtagonistA was 
 The two of them were finally able to be together , and they were happy 
It was getting late , and Twilight was getting tired 
 ProtagonistB had been on the run from the law for years , and ProtagonistB was getting tired 
 ProtagonistB had been hiding out in the woods , living off the land and stealing what ProtagonistB needed to survive 
 But one day , ProtagonistB was caught by a group of men who were intent on taking ProtagonistB back to the city to stand trial 
 ProtagonistB was sure that ProtagonistB was going to die , but then the most amazing thing happened 
 A man appeared out of nowhere and fought off the men who were trying to capture ProtagonistB 
 The man told ProtagonistB to run and not look back 
 ProtagonistB did as ProtagonistB was told , and ProtagonistB made ProtagonistB's way to the farm of ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC took ProtagonistB in and nursed ProtagonistB back to health 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistC everything that had happened , and ProtagonistC promised to help ProtagonistB get ProtagonistB's life back on track 
 Thanks to the man who had saved ProtagonistB's life , and ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB was finally able to start over 
 ProtagonistB would never forget the kindness that had been shown to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB vowed to pay it forward however ProtagonistB could 
It was in the year 1763 when , in a county in western France , a small town named Vernay was formed , and the village of Neuve - Chalmers had its first residents 
 The name and the first and only dame which has ever been mentioned in the history of France , was ProtagonistA 
 In the year 1789 , the French Revolution began , and Neuve - Chalmers was one of the first towns to be affected 
 The people were angry and resentful of the way they had been treated by the monarchy , and they were determined to make a change 
 On the night of the 4th of August , a group of men , led by Bob Moodie , marched into the town square and demanded that ProtagonistB surrender the keys to the town hall 
 When ProtagonistB refused , Bob Moodie threatened to kill ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB still refused , so Bob Moodie made good on his threat and shot ProtagonistB dead 
 The town hall was stormed and the townspeople took control 
 Neuve - Chalmers was renamed Vernay , in honor of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA became known as the heroine of the Revolution 
 It had been a long day at work and ProtagonistA was ready to relax 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 ProtagonistB was sobbing and looked like ProtagonistB was in pain 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with tears in ProtagonistB's eyes and shook ProtagonistB's head 
  No , ProtagonistB 'm not okay ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB's husband just left ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB do n't know what to do 
  That must be really hard for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB nodded and wiped ProtagonistB's tears 
  It is ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But ProtagonistB 'll be okay 
 ProtagonistB just need some time 
 But ProtagonistB still saw ProtagonistA 
 It looked abandoned , but ProtagonistA decided to check it out anyway 
 Finally , ProtagonistB got up and came to the door 
 ProtagonistB was an old woman , and ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB had seen better days 
 They were heading south , to the sun and the fragrant air 
 They asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA wanted to join them , and ProtagonistA did 
 The group was sympathetic , and they decided to go back and check on ProtagonistB 
 When they arrived at the farmhouse , they found that ProtagonistB had passed away 
 But they also found that ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistA a small bag of food and a note thanking ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's kindness 
ProtagonistB did not ask ProtagonistA to do anything , said Applejack , and it was not a question ProtagonistA had thought about thoroughly , much less questioned 
 It was true , ProtagonistB had never asked ProtagonistA to do anything , not even chores around the house 
 ProtagonistB had never asked ProtagonistA to do anything , but ProtagonistB had always supported ProtagonistA's dreams 
ProtagonistB had been so anxious for ProtagonistA to take ProtagonistA's first flight ProtagonistB had not known until that moment that the spell they were about to cast was for something else altogether 
 In ProtagonistB's haste to get ProtagonistA ready for ProtagonistA's big day , ProtagonistB had not realized that the other witches and wizards in the coven had other plans for ProtagonistA 
 As the spell began to take hold , ProtagonistB could see the look of terror in ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistB tried to fight against it , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistA was caught in the spell and would be used as a vessel for the dark forces that the coven worshipped 
 There was nothing ProtagonistB could do but watch as ProtagonistA was taken over by the evil spirits 
 ProtagonistB could only hope that someday ProtagonistA would be able to break free from their control and live a normal life 
ProtagonistB watched as ProtagonistA twisted and turned , ProtagonistA's hooves shifting as ProtagonistA tried to keep the position 
 The other horses in the field had long since given up and gone to graze , but ProtagonistA was determined to get the last bit of hay 
 ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a pat on the head , understanding ProtagonistA's determination 
 It was a shock to ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA had always been careful to avoid getting pregnant 
 Four years later , ProtagonistB was born 
 ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB's ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was the light of ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB more than anything 
 ProtagonistB was the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB would often find ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's room , talking to ProtagonistA in a high - pitched voice 
  ProtagonistA , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB would ask 
 One day , ProtagonistB came into ProtagonistA's room and found ProtagonistA sitting on the floor , surrounded by dolls 
 ProtagonistB was watching over ProtagonistA's hooves - a delicate balance , ProtagonistA reasoned , between worry and excitement - and Shining Armor was resting on ProtagonistA's shoulder 
 It felt like only yesterday that they were sitting in that field together , laughing and joking and enjoying the sunshine 
ProtagonistB watched as ProtagonistA twisted and turned , ProtagonistA's hooves shifting as ProtagonistA tried to keep the position 
 The other horses in the field were grazing peacefully , but ProtagonistA just could n't seem to find a comfortable spot 
 ProtagonistB felt sorry for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB knew that there was nothing ProtagonistB could do to help 
The house where ProtagonistA had lived with ProtagonistA's family had stood empty from the start 
 It was a big , old house that had been in the family for generations 
 ProtagonistA's parents had died when ProtagonistA was a child , and ProtagonistA had been raised by ProtagonistA's grandparents 
 So , it sat empty 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had a buyer for the house 
 They told ProtagonistA that they had always wanted a big , old house like this and they were excited to make it their home 
 The house sat empty for years , but it was finally going to be loved again 
ProtagonistB was born as the son of a salaried workman in the midst of a profusion of pre - war industries of industrial importance , and who , having hung on throughout a highly successful career , has made ProtagonistA's fortune by , and in fact made ProtagonistA's fortune quite a while ago , by the methods which ProtagonistA has adopted to capitalize upon ProtagonistA's great fortune , although of late the conflict of interest which ProtagonistC enjoyed , in procuring a certain amount of capital , has become a serious matter 
Bob 's father worked hard to provide for his family and instilled the importance of a good work ethic in ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistB was old enough , ProtagonistB started working in one of the pre - war industries and quickly rose through the ranks 
 Seeing the potential for making a lot of money , ProtagonistB started to capitalize on ProtagonistB's position and soon made a fortune 
 However , lately ProtagonistB has been having some conflict with ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC is also in a position to make a lot of money , but ProtagonistC has been using some of ProtagonistC's capital to help ProtagonistB out 
 ProtagonistB is not sure if ProtagonistB wants to continue this arrangement , as it could be seen as a conflict of interest 
 ProtagonistB is still debating what to do , but ProtagonistB knows that whatever ProtagonistB decides , ProtagonistB will be successful 
 So , when ProtagonistA finally met ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was thrilled 
 Unfortunately , ProtagonistB turned out to be a psychopath who wanted nothing more than to see ProtagonistA dead 
 One night , ProtagonistB attacked ProtagonistA with a knife , intent on killing ProtagonistA 
 It was the first night of the rest of ProtagonistA's life 
 And ProtagonistA was determined to make sure that ProtagonistA would never be victimized like that again 
 But today , something was different 
 ProtagonistB , please get up ,  said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA took the ferry down the winding stone steps into the harbor 
 But ProtagonistB did n't move 
 ProtagonistB was wearing strange clothes and ProtagonistB's skin was a different color 
 They were laughing and joking , but when they saw ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB , they stopped 
 What 's going on here ?  one of the men asked 
 I found ProtagonistB at the bottom of the steps 
 The men hesitated for a moment , but then they came over and helped ProtagonistA lift ProtagonistB 
 They carried ProtagonistB up the steps and into the town 
 But this was different 
 This was cold , calculated murder 
 It was brutal , and it was quick 
 There was no mercy , no hesitation 
 ProtagonistB did n't even seem to care that ProtagonistA was watching 
 It was over in seconds 
 The man was dead , and ProtagonistA was left alone with his body 
 ProtagonistB was still out there , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was next 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear ProtagonistC come in 
  What 's wrong ?  ProtagonistC asked 
  Nothing ,  ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA 'm just having a bad day 
 ProtagonistB trusted ProtagonistA with everything , even ProtagonistB's tongue 
 ProtagonistB realized then that ProtagonistB never should have trusted ProtagonistA , because ProtagonistA was n't real 
Slow , steady , and thoughtful , the moment ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's seat at the table , Equestrians moved through the dark and the undulating hall of the palace , picking vixens and lasses out of the crowd and casting them away to dance with the three most beautiful sisters of the Siras Academy 
 The music was low and sensual , and the air was thick with the scent of jasmine and musk 
 ProtagonistA's heart quickened as ProtagonistA watched the sisters move gracefully around the room 
 They were like goddesses 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistB , turned and looked directly at ProtagonistA 
 Their eyes locked , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart skip a beat 
 ProtagonistB smiled , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's whole body relax 
 All ProtagonistA could focus on was ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA reached ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA's hand and led ProtagonistA onto the dance floor 
 The music swelled around them , and they began to move 
 It was as if they were one person 
 They flowed together effortlessly , their bodies molding to each other perfectly 
 As the music came to a close , ProtagonistB dipped ProtagonistA low and kissed ProtagonistA lightly on the lips 
 ProtagonistA's head was spinning 
 ProtagonistB pulled away and smiled at ProtagonistA 
  Thank ProtagonistA for the dance ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB walk away , feeling like ProtagonistA had just been given the most precious gift in the world 
 However , one day , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to tell ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's ministry 
 ProtagonistB listened patiently as ProtagonistA spoke , and ProtagonistB was there for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA needed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was crying and looked very upset 
 ProtagonistA's heart sank 
 Turns out , ProtagonistB had been diagnosed with cancer 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistA was supposed to be the strong one , but ProtagonistA just could n't handle it 
 They both knew that this was going to be a long , hard battle , but they were ready to fight it together 
The U - boat crash into the moor was a horrific sight 
 The large ship was covered in splinters , and there was a corpse of ProtagonistA inside 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA had been murdered in some strange way 
 ProtagonistB was aboard the ship when it happened , and ProtagonistB was the one who first saw it 
 ProtagonistB was horrified by what ProtagonistB saw , and ProtagonistB knew that something strange had happened 
ProtagonistB had been battling ovarian cancer for years , and ProtagonistA had been by ProtagonistB's side every step of the way 
 It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever experienced a dream like this , and it was the most powerful one ProtagonistA 'd ever had 
ProtagonistA thought that was it then , ProtagonistA's dear friend said as ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's back on the landscape 
 Even an assassination attempt in the capital would be unlikely 
 It was a grand affair , hosted by the richest man in the city 
 ProtagonistA had been invited because ProtagonistA was good friends with ProtagonistB 
 I do n't know why he 's still alive 
 We 've tried everything 
 I know , but we ca n't keep trying 
 It 's too risky 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who they were talking about , but ProtagonistA had a feeling it was n't good 
 ProtagonistB was horrified 
 ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB's father had enemies , but ProtagonistB never thought they would go this far 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help and promised to keep ProtagonistA safe 
 A few weeks later , ProtagonistA was attacked in the street 
 ProtagonistA was beaten and left for dead , but ProtagonistA survived 
It is a month of extreme hardship for ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA can not possibly be surprised by the scene which I have set before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB is a frail woman , and ProtagonistB is struggling to keep up with the demands of ProtagonistB's husband 's estate 
 ProtagonistB has been forced to take on many of the responsibilities that ProtagonistB's husband can no longer handle , and ProtagonistB is struggling to keep up 
 ProtagonistB is not the only one who is struggling 
 ProtagonistB is grateful for the help that ProtagonistA is giving , but ProtagonistB can tell that ProtagonistA is struggling 
 ProtagonistB is worried about ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB is worried about the future 
 People would flock to see ProtagonistA play , and ProtagonistA always managed to walk away with more money than ProtagonistA started with 
 ProtagonistB's name was Ruben de Vros , and ProtagonistB lived in a far - off land 
 ProtagonistA was determined to beat ProtagonistB 
 They sat down to play , and after a long and intense game , ProtagonistA finally emerged victorious 
 ProtagonistA's parents had always been supportive , but they were also relieved when ProtagonistA finally graduated 
 They had been worried about ProtagonistA for years , and they knew that ProtagonistA was going to have to find ProtagonistA's own way in life 
 ProtagonistA's first order of business was to find a wife 
 ProtagonistA had always been attracted to older women , and ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's sights set on ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's parents were not thrilled with ProtagonistA's choice of bride , but they knew that they could not stop ProtagonistA 
 They gave ProtagonistA their blessing , and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB set off on their honeymoon 
 ProtagonistB was not what ProtagonistA had expected 
 ProtagonistB was demanding , and ProtagonistB wanted ProtagonistA to do everything ProtagonistB's way 
 ProtagonistB was constantly complaining , and ProtagonistB made it clear that ProtagonistB was not happy 
 ProtagonistA was relieved when the honeymoon was finally over , and ProtagonistA was able to go home to ProtagonistA's parents 
 ProtagonistA was determined to find ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was willing to wait as long as it took 
 One day , ProtagonistB broke up with ProtagonistA out of the blue 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken and did n't know what to do 
 It made ProtagonistA realize that ProtagonistA was better off without ProtagonistB and that ProtagonistA had a lot of great friends and a bright future ahead of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was quiet and withdrawn , with a nervous air about ProtagonistB 
 They had been sitting in silence for some time , when ProtagonistB finally spoke 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB need to ask ProtagonistA a favor 
  Sure , anything ProtagonistB need 
 I need ProtagonistA to kill ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was stunned 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA imploringly 
 ProtagonistB ca n't go on living like this 
 ProtagonistB 'm in so much pain , ProtagonistA 
 Please , just end it for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was torn 
 The smaller man looked relieved 
 I'm sorry , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said , before pulling the trigger 
 ProtagonistA 've done well , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB , looking up at the heavens with a kind of dislike and a kind of curiosity 
 And ProtagonistB had always been happy for ProtagonistA 
 But now , sitting next to each other on a bench in the park , looking up at the stars , ProtagonistB felt a twinge of jealousy 
  What do ProtagonistA mean ?  ProtagonistB asked 
  ProtagonistA mean , ProtagonistA 've done well ,  said ProtagonistA 
   So ?   So , ProtagonistB 'm happy for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been hit on the head with a paperweight from behind , and was now bleeding profusely from the wound 
 ProtagonistB had been quick and efficient , and ProtagonistA never even saw ProtagonistB coming 
 One day , ProtagonistA was approached by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB needed someone who was honest and hardworking , and that ProtagonistB had heard good things about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB offered ProtagonistA a large sum of money to do the job , and ProtagonistA accepted 
 ProtagonistA was given a key to a building in the city and told to go there and wait for further instructions 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistC came out and told ProtagonistA to follow ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC opened a door and motioned for ProtagonistA to go inside 
 On the table was a pile of money 
 ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was to count the money and then put it into bags 
 ProtagonistC thanked ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA would be paid handsomely for ProtagonistA's work 
 ProtagonistB was sitting at ProtagonistB's desk , and ProtagonistB looked up when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA 
  Come in , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Have a seat 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm sorry to say that we 're going to have to let ProtagonistA go 
  ProtagonistA was shocked 
 ProtagonistA had never been fired before 
  It 's just not working out ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm sorry 
  ProtagonistA gathered ProtagonistA's things and left the office , ProtagonistA's head held high 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA and asked ProtagonistA for help 
 ProtagonistB explained that ProtagonistB was new to the city and did n't know anyone , and ProtagonistB was looking for a job 
 ProtagonistB was grateful to ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help , and ProtagonistB was soon able to start ProtagonistB's new job 
 ProtagonistB was excited to be able to help others in the city , just as ProtagonistA had helped ProtagonistB 
 The paper told the story of a world that existed outside of ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated by this new discovery , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to find out more 
It was last Sunday afternoon , before the holiday of satisfaction , that ProtagonistA learned that ProtagonistB had been obliged to ask ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's blessing to have the privilege of celebrating the nuptial of ProtagonistB's second cousin , the Empress 
 ProtagonistA was taken aback at first , but then ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistB had always been a bit of a romantic 
 ProtagonistB ran away 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was being robbed 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB's name was John 
ProtagonistB was smiling when ProtagonistA said to Dave , ProtagonistA would like to introduce ProtagonistB to ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB had been eyeing ProtagonistC since ProtagonistC arrived at the party 
 ProtagonistC was beautiful and ProtagonistB could tell ProtagonistC was smart too 
 ProtagonistB was glad when ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA wanted to introduce ProtagonistB to ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC , this is Marek 
 ProtagonistB , this is ProtagonistC 
 It 's nice to meet ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistB's eyes never leaving ProtagonistC 
 Likewise ,  ProtagonistC replied 
 They talked for a while and ProtagonistB found ProtagonistB falling for ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was everything ProtagonistB wanted in a woman 
 ProtagonistB was about to ask ProtagonistC out when ProtagonistC got a phone call and had to leave 
 I'm sorry , ProtagonistC have to go ,  ProtagonistC said 
  It was nice meeting ProtagonistB 
 Yeah , you too ,  ProtagonistB said , disappointed 
 ProtagonistB watched ProtagonistC's leave , but ProtagonistB was determined to see ProtagonistC again 
 ProtagonistB would find a way 
 ProtagonistB ran up to ProtagonistA and they embraced , laughing at the coincidence of seeing each other here 
 They chatted for a bit , catching up on old times , before ProtagonistB had to go to class 
 Just then , the office door opened and ProtagonistC walked in 
 We 've missed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB , told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB needed someone to help with the lunch rush 
 ProtagonistA was also glad to have a place to stay for a while ; ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA could stay in the apartment above the cafe 
It was the first day of spring in the year of ProtagonistA's coronation , and ProtagonistB was up at the royal court to welcome ProtagonistA to the throne ; but the weather had already turned hot and dry and the first - born were already starting to be gone 
 The court was in an uproar , with the nobles arguing and the commoners begging for food and water 
 ProtagonistB was trying to calm the people down when ProtagonistB saw a group of men on horseback , coming from the direction of the forest 
 They were covered in dust and their clothes were torn , but they were smiling and waving 
 ProtagonistB went to meet them , and they told ProtagonistB that they had found a spring in the forest , and that there was plenty of water and food there 
 They invited ProtagonistB and the other members of the court to come and stay in the forest , and ProtagonistB accepted their offer 
 The people of the court were relieved and happy to hear that there was help on the way , and they all set off for the Forest 
 ProtagonistB , it 's Ephron 
 It 's been a while and ProtagonistA 'm starting to get worried 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm sorry 
 ProtagonistB did n't realize how long it would take 
 ProtagonistB 'm almost done , ProtagonistB promise 
 Okay , ProtagonistB 
 Hurry up and finish 
 They had been through a lot together , good and bad 
 But when ProtagonistB passed away suddenly , it was more than ProtagonistA could bear 
 ProtagonistA was lost without ProtagonistB 
 But now , there was no one to cook for ProtagonistA 
The first time ProtagonistA let out a long whiny howl , the servant woke up ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB , came over to see what was the matter 
 When ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB knew immediately that ProtagonistA was sick 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to the vet , where ProtagonistA was diagnosed with a rare disease 
 The vet said there was no cure , but ProtagonistB refused to give up on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB did everything ProtagonistB could to make ProtagonistA comfortable , and even though ProtagonistA only lived for a few more months , ProtagonistB was glad ProtagonistB was able to give ProtagonistA a loving home in ProtagonistA's final days 
ProtagonistA should have known it , for ProtagonistA was such a fool in the beginning 
 But then one day , ProtagonistB broke up with ProtagonistA out of the blue 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken and did n't know what to do 
 But nothing worked 
 ProtagonistB was gone for good 
The kids who went to school in the little green hall were pretty , but if ProtagonistA had been ten years old , ProtagonistA would have known by a glance that a great deal of activity lay ahead of ProtagonistA 
 The hall was full of kids , all of them talking and laughing and running around 
 ProtagonistB's name was ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was in ProtagonistA's class 
 ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , too , and ProtagonistB came over to ProtagonistA 
  Hi , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA over to where ProtagonistB's friends were playing 
 This is why , when ProtagonistA was twenty - four , ProtagonistA decided to change ProtagonistA's name from Erland to ProtagonistA 
 This is why , when ProtagonistA changed ProtagonistA's name , ProtagonistA decided to move to a new city 
 But , there was one thing that was bothering ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was relieved when ProtagonistB did n't judge ProtagonistA 
 In fact , ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB liked ProtagonistA even more for being honest 
 From then on , ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA would always be honest with the people ProtagonistA cared about 
 The doors of the church were open , and the light from the setting sun shone in through the windows , casting a warm and inviting glow 
 It was a small church , with a simple altar and a few rows of pews 
 But what struck ProtagonistA most was the atmosphere of peace and serenity that pervaded the place 
 Suddenly , all the worries and stresses of the outside world melted away , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA relax 
 Hello , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said in a kind voice 
  ProtagonistB 'm sorry to disturb ProtagonistA , but we 're about to close up for the night 
  That 's all right 
 It was small and had wings , and it was fluttering around in a way that ProtagonistA found quite amusing 
 The two of them hit it off immediately and became fast friends 
 ProtagonistA was especially fascinated by the fact that ProtagonistB could fly!Bob and ProtagonistB spent many happy hours together , and ProtagonistA was sad when it was time for ProtagonistB to fly back to the fairy world 
 The first passage described a dream in which ProtagonistB saw a city made entirely of glass 
 The second passage described a dream in which ProtagonistB saw a man flying through the air 
 The Book of Dreams became a bestseller and made ProtagonistA famous 
 ProtagonistA was lost in the city and needed ProtagonistB to come and find ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB did , and they were reunited 
ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA for weeks 
 Finally , ProtagonistB 'd had enough 
  Time 's up , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB shouted down at ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB 'm calling the police 
 ProtagonistB tackled ProtagonistA to the ground and held ProtagonistA there until the police arrived 
 It was a simple enough plan , but it would take some work 
 It sounded easy enough , but ProtagonistA knew that it would n't be 
 ProtagonistB was grumbling about everything that was going wrong in ProtagonistB's life 
 It was just ProtagonistA's nature 
 ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things , said goodbye to ProtagonistA's tour group , and caught the next flight home 
 It was great to be back in ProtagonistA's own house , and ProtagonistB was there to greet ProtagonistA at the door 
Just leave ProtagonistA alone , please , ProtagonistB said 
 The other ponies in the herd did n't understand why ProtagonistB was so protective of ProtagonistA , but they left ProtagonistA alone anyway 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a white robe and had a long beard 
 ProtagonistB looked very wise 
 ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistA have a great destiny ahead of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 
  Then ProtagonistB disappeared and ProtagonistA woke up 
You 're gon na eat ProtagonistB , said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA lay down on the sand , but do n't kill ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistB was three years old when ProtagonistA died 
 When ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistB was left alone in the world 
 ProtagonistB did n't know how to cope with the loss of ProtagonistA and was very sad for a long time 
 ProtagonistB do n't know why ProtagonistA said ProtagonistB's name , but ProtagonistB guess ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistB to know that ProtagonistA knew who ProtagonistB was 
 ProtagonistB did n't know ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB felt bad nonetheless 
 ProtagonistB asked the police what happened and they said it looked like a robbery gone wrong 
 ProtagonistB guess the world is just a cruel place 
 ProtagonistA's parents had been at their wit 's end with ProtagonistA 
 They had tried everything they could think of , but nothing had worked 
 They had even sent ProtagonistA to therapy , but that had n't helped either 
 But then , one day , something changed 
 ProtagonistB was different than anyone ProtagonistA had ever met before 
 ProtagonistB was kind and sweet and ProtagonistB did n't take any of ProtagonistA's crap 
 ProtagonistB was also really pretty , which did n't hurt 
 ProtagonistB was the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would do anything for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB had saved ProtagonistA from a life of trouble and ProtagonistA would be forever grateful to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was shocked and amazed at the perfectly calculated plot 
 ProtagonistA had been having the same dream for weeks now and it was always the same 
 There would be people around ProtagonistA , but they would never speak to ProtagonistA 
 They would just go about their business as if ProtagonistA was n't there 
 ProtagonistA was trapped in ProtagonistA's room , in ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA did n't know how to escape 
 Suddenly , the door to ProtagonistA's room opened and ProtagonistB walked in 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with a concerned expression and asked ProtagonistA what was wrong 
 ProtagonistB sat down on the bed and took ProtagonistA's hand 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately and that it was normal to have strange dreams 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA should try to relax and not worry so much 
  There ProtagonistB is ,  ProtagonistA said , pointing to a small dot on the page 
  ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been obsessed with finding ProtagonistB ever since ProtagonistA was a child , and now ProtagonistA had finally done it 
Rolling over in pain , nodding slowly , looking up at the tree , eyes wide and eyes wide , ProtagonistB stared down at ProtagonistA , wondering if ProtagonistA was awake 
 ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistA gently , but there was no response 
 ProtagonistB felt for a pulse , but could n't find one 
 ProtagonistB's eyes filled with tears as ProtagonistB realized ProtagonistA was gone 
 ProtagonistB sat there for a long time , staring at ProtagonistA's body , until ProtagonistB finally got up and walked away 
It was a hot February day in the year 1826 , when ProtagonistA lay the body of ProtagonistB , to the sad and uncharitable 
 ProtagonistB had been bitten by a snake while they were out hunting and there was no antivenom 
 ProtagonistA was tempted to just give up and end it all , but something inside ProtagonistA would n't let ProtagonistA 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB was leaving ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB had found someone else 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 After a few months , ProtagonistB came back to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB had made a mistake 
 ProtagonistB had promised to come by and ProtagonistA was determined to wait for ProtagonistB 
 They embraced each other and ProtagonistA invited ProtagonistB inside 
 The Park was a beautiful , sprawling estate with a huge house at its center 
 It was in a state of disrepair , and it looked like it had been abandoned for years 
 The house was dusty and musty , and it was clear that no one had been inside for a long time 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled , and ProtagonistA went back to the Park house to show ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's find 
 ProtagonistB was very excited when ProtagonistB saw the treasure that ProtagonistA had found 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the house ProtagonistA had found was actually an old pirate 's lair , and that the treasure must have belonged to a pirate who had hidden it there long ago 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled to have found such a treasure , and ProtagonistA was excited to tell ProtagonistA's friends all about it 
 They had been through all the fertility treatments and nothing had worked 
 They had just about given up hope when ProtagonistB found out ProtagonistB was pregnant 
 ProtagonistB was happy too , but ProtagonistB was also a little scared 
 ProtagonistB was n't sure how ProtagonistB was going to handle being a mother 
 And that 's what ProtagonistA said when ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was pregnant 
When ProtagonistA was eight years old , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to dinner and asked ProtagonistA whether ProtagonistA would like a dog 
 ProtagonistB was so happy that ProtagonistB got ProtagonistA a dog the very next day 
 ProtagonistA named ProtagonistA's dog ProtagonistC and they became best friends 
 ProtagonistC would always follow ProtagonistA around and would always be there when ProtagonistA needed ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was taken to the hospital and was in a coma for weeks 
 The only thing ProtagonistA could remember was ProtagonistB 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was so grateful to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would never forget ProtagonistA's kindness 
Two weeks ago , in the town on the Mississippi , there lived ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was a simple man , who worked hard and never complained 
 The two men were friends , and they would often sit and talk together in the evenings 
 ProtagonistB was sad to hear this news , but ProtagonistB wished ProtagonistA well 
 A few weeks after ProtagonistA had left , ProtagonistB began to notice that strange things were happening in town 
 People were disappearing , and there was a feeling of fear in the air 
 ProtagonistB did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB had to find out what was going on 
 One night , ProtagonistB followed one of the townspeople who had been acting strange 
 ProtagonistB saw the man meet up with another man in a dark alley 
 ProtagonistB could n't hear what they were saying , but ProtagonistB saw the first man hand over a bundle of money 
 The next day , ProtagonistB went to the police and told them what ProtagonistB had seen 
 The police began to investigate , and soon they realized that ProtagonistA was behind the disappearances 
 They went to arrest ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA had already left town 
 ProtagonistB was a hero , and ProtagonistB was glad that ProtagonistB had been able to help solve the mystery 
The first time ProtagonistA bought ProtagonistB the farm ProtagonistB lived on , it was to construct a house for ProtagonistA's cousin 's pet phoenix 
 The phoenix , a beautiful creature with golden feathers , needed a place to live that would be safe from harm 
 The phoenix was very grateful and flew around ProtagonistA's farm , singing beautiful songs 
 Every time the sun set , the phoenix would fly into the house and perch on the highest point , watching over the farm 
 One day , when ProtagonistA went to school , there was ProtagonistB in the school room 
 But ProtagonistB did n't look like ProtagonistA at all 
 ProtagonistB had dark hair , and dark eyes , and ProtagonistB always seemed to be looking at the world in a different way 
 It was a deep , guttural cry that shook ProtagonistA's entire body 
 The sound was so loud and so unexpected that it woke ProtagonistB up from ProtagonistB's own sleep 
 ProtagonistB sat up in bed and looked at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB did n't know what to do , so ProtagonistB just sat there and watched ProtagonistA 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistA's crying subsided and ProtagonistA fell back into a deep sleep 
 ProtagonistB lay down and tried to go back to sleep , but ProtagonistB could n't 
 ProtagonistB was too disturbed by what ProtagonistB had seen 
 It was a beautiful day and the sun was shining 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought when ProtagonistA heard a car pull up outside 
 I forgot ProtagonistB's wallet ,  ProtagonistB said sheepishly 
 I'm sorry I left ProtagonistA alone ,  ProtagonistB said 
 Are ProtagonistA sure ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 ProtagonistB hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistB got back in the car and drove off 
 The book is called  The Catcher in the Rye  and it is ProtagonistA's favorite book 
 It is a story about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB is a very misunderstood character , and ProtagonistA can relate to ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA was sixteen , the second color started to change , and by the time ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA's hair was an entirely different color 
ProtagonistA was called ' calypso , ' and was carried away in the arms of ProtagonistA's mother , who , however , was not exactly like an angel ; but perhaps like a god , the same kind of god , as the sun and the moon and the stars and the whole galaxy 
 ProtagonistB had blue eyes , brown hair , and a florid face 
 ProtagonistB was tall and slender , with a long white beard and hair that was trimmed and frothy - blond 
 ProtagonistB was very proud of ProtagonistA 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was five years old , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to the park 
 They walked hand in hand , and ProtagonistA skipped along happily 
 Suddenly , a gust of wind blew ProtagonistA's hat off ProtagonistA's head and into a tree 
 ProtagonistB climbed up the tree to retrieve it , but ProtagonistB slipped and fell 
 A crowd gathered , and someone called for an ambulance 
 ProtagonistB was taken to the hospital , but ProtagonistB died a few days later 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 But ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistA a gift : ProtagonistB's love for life 
There 's ProtagonistA , and if ProtagonistB follow ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB should catch ProtagonistA , said ProtagonistB , but seemed not to be very careful 
 ProtagonistB was speeding down the road , following ProtagonistA 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB lost sight of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB pulled over to the side of the road , frustrated 
 ProtagonistB was about to give up when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA's car pulled over on the side of the road ahead of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB smiled and pulled over behind ProtagonistA 
 That is until ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was different than anyone ProtagonistA had ever met before 
 ProtagonistB was kind and caring and ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA that there was more to life than just the way things were done 
 ProtagonistA fell in love with ProtagonistB and they were married soon after 
 They were happy together and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never be content with just the way things were done again 
 Our granda said ,  said ProtagonistB ,  that ProtagonistA was the daughter of ProtagonistC ; but ProtagonistA lived before that , and has been dead many years 
  ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head and sighed 
  It is a shame , such a shame 
 A kind man 
 ProtagonistA would have made a good husband , ProtagonistB think 
 The old woman 's eyes grew distant and ProtagonistB began to speak softly , as if ProtagonistB were talking to ProtagonistB 
  They say that when ProtagonistC was just a girl , ProtagonistC was very beautiful 
 All the young men in the empire wanted to marry ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistD would only allow ProtagonistC to marry a man who could bring ProtagonistD the head of a dragon 
 Many men tried , but none succeeded 
 ProtagonistD was so pleased that ProtagonistD immediately allowed ProtagonistA to marry ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB paused and shook ProtagonistB's head again 
  But it was not to be 
 Just a few days after the wedding , ProtagonistA was killed in a hunting accident 
 ProtagonistC was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistC never married again and ProtagonistC never had any children 
 ProtagonistC ruled the empire for many years , but ProtagonistC was never the same after ProtagonistA died 
 ProtagonistB sighed and fell silent 
 ProtagonistC seemed to have forgotten that ProtagonistB was even there 
 ProtagonistB quietly got up and left , leaving ProtagonistC to ProtagonistC's memories 
 ProtagonistA was mesmerized by the sights and sounds of the bustling streets and the beautiful temples 
 ProtagonistB had been a donkey driver in China for many years 
 ProtagonistB had always wanted to see ProtagonistA grow up and have a better life than ProtagonistB had 
 The journey was long and difficult , but ProtagonistA persevered 
 ProtagonistA was immediately taken in by the kind staff and the other children 
 ProtagonistA was especially fascinated by the stories of the great emperor Qin Shihuangdi 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to visit ProtagonistA at the orphanage 
 ProtagonistB was so proud of ProtagonistA and the man ProtagonistA had become 
A fair - faced , blue - eyed girl with a soft , slightly lisping voice , the daughter of a Brooklyn market girl and a remorseless explorer , who had short , spiky black hair and a small , round face , and was accustomed to be the last one to board the little white train at the west end of the Bronx , or at least to begin ProtagonistA's journey without any companion except ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB had been on the train for what felt like hours , though it was probably only minutes 
 ProtagonistB was the only passenger in the car , and the only person ProtagonistB had seen since boarding was ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was sitting in the front of the car , and ProtagonistB was in the back 
 ProtagonistB was getting sleepy , and was just about to doze off when ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistC get up and walk towards ProtagonistB 
 Excuse ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistC said ,  but ProtagonistC could n't help but notice that ProtagonistB 're the only one in this car 
 ProtagonistC was just wondering if ProtagonistB 're okay 
 The girl sat up and rubbed ProtagonistB's eyes 
  ProtagonistB 'm fine ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm just waiting for ProtagonistB's stop 
 Oh , okay ,  ProtagonistC said 
 ProtagonistC paused for a moment , as if ProtagonistC wanted to say something else , but then ProtagonistC turned and walked back to ProtagonistC's seat 
 ProtagonistB leaned ProtagonistB's head against the window and watched the darkness outside 
 ProtagonistB was getting sleepy again when ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistC get up and walk towards ProtagonistB 
 Excuse ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistC said again ,  but ProtagonistC was just wondering if ProtagonistB 're sure ProtagonistB 're okay 
 ProtagonistB 've been sitting there for a while , and ProtagonistC just wanted to make sure ProtagonistB 're not lost or anything 
 I'm fine ,  ProtagonistB said , a little more forcefully this time 
  ProtagonistB 'm just waiting for ProtagonistB's stop 
 Okay ,  ProtagonistC said 
 ProtagonistC paused again , but this time ProtagonistC did n't turn around 
  ProtagonistC's name 's Bob , by the way 
 What 's yours?Mary ,  ProtagonistB said 
 Nice to meet ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistC said 
  ProtagonistC hope ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's stop soon 
 With that , ProtagonistC turned and walked back to ProtagonistC's seat 
 ProtagonistB leaned ProtagonistB's head against the window again and watched the darkness outside 
 ProtagonistB was just about to doze off when ProtagonistB heard the train come to a stop 
 ProtagonistB sat up and looked out the window , and saw that they were at ProtagonistB's stop 
 ProtagonistB got up and grabbed ProtagonistB's bag , then turned to ProtagonistC 
  Thank ProtagonistC for talking to ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB appreciate it 
 No problem ,  ProtagonistC said 
  ProtagonistC just wanted to make sure ProtagonistB were okay 
 Have a good night , ProtagonistB 
 You too , ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB got off the train and watched it pull away , then turned and walked towards ProtagonistB's home 
Once upon a time there lived ProtagonistA 
 However , one day ProtagonistA's world came crashing down 
 ProtagonistA was fired from ProtagonistA's job , ProtagonistA's wife left ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's children were taken away from ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistA was lost and alone 
 ProtagonistB was kind , caring , and ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA get back on ProtagonistA's feet 
 They got married and they were happy ever after 
 The living room is still full of ProtagonistA's books , ProtagonistA's favorite chair by the window is still there , and ProtagonistA's ashes are still on the mantle 
 ProtagonistB , has kept everything the same , as if ProtagonistB is waiting for ProtagonistA to come back 
 I know ProtagonistB still misses ProtagonistA terribly 
 It was only three years ago that ProtagonistA passed away , but it feels like a lifetime 
 I remember the day ProtagonistA told me ProtagonistA's dreams 
 We were sitting in ProtagonistA's living room , and ProtagonistA was telling me about all the places ProtagonistA wanted to see and the things ProtagonistA wanted to do 
 I was so inspired by ProtagonistA 
 Now , every time I visit ProtagonistA's house , I feel like ProtagonistA is still there with me , living ProtagonistA's dreams 
ProtagonistA's life changed the day ProtagonistB died 
 It was an accident , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like it was ProtagonistA's fault 
 If only ProtagonistA had let ProtagonistB go , ProtagonistB might still be alive 
 ProtagonistA was tempted to end ProtagonistA's own life , but something stopped ProtagonistA 
 In one dream , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was now immortal 
 ProtagonistA was terrified at first , but ProtagonistA slowly started to accept ProtagonistA's new reality 
The court papers in the office of ProtagonistA , dated May 6 , 1795 , showed that ProtagonistB , had put the cookery of ProtagonistA on ice , in order to prevent any further vanity 
 ProtagonistB was a cold woman , and ProtagonistB refused 
 It was a beautiful meal , and it was perfect 
 ProtagonistB was shocked 
 ProtagonistB had never seen such a beautiful meal 
 ProtagonistB lifted the ban on ProtagonistA's cookery , and ProtagonistB apologized for ever doubting ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was loved by all , and ProtagonistA was always remembered for ProtagonistA's delicious food 
 It had been a long day , and ProtagonistA was just ready to relax 
 It sounded like ProtagonistB was on the phone , and ProtagonistB was crying 
 ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with tears in ProtagonistB's eyes 
  ProtagonistA 'm here for ProtagonistB 
 The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was going to bed , but now ProtagonistA was in some sort of strange room 
 The walls were made of stone , and there was a small window high up that let in a sliver of light 
 Inside was ProtagonistB , huddled in a corner 
 ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with terror in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 So ProtagonistA sat down and tried to comfort ProtagonistB the best ProtagonistA could 
In the year of 1358 , during the reign of ProtagonistB , was born ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was born into a poor family and never had much growing up 
 It was the voice of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB had heard of ProtagonistA's hard work and wanted to reward ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to come to the palace and work for ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB 'm so sorry , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said ,  but ProtagonistB just ca n't help it 
 It 's been like this for days , and the doctors do n't know what to do 
 They say it 's some sort of infection , but they ca n't seem to get rid of it 
In truth , for all the things ProtagonistA had , no one expected ProtagonistA to be a mother 
 When ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistB was in the kitchen cooking dinner when the doorbell rang 
 ProtagonistB answered the door and ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB talking to someone in a low voice 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistB came into the living room and sat down next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC had been killed and that ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistC again 
ProtagonistB partook of ProtagonistA's tea , an infusion of which was prepared for ProtagonistA by the hand of the cook of the kitchen 
 It was a most delicious tea , and ProtagonistB was quite pleased with it 
  It was nice to meet ProtagonistB 
  And with that , ProtagonistA was gone 
ProtagonistA's head was pounding as ProtagonistA slowly opened ProtagonistA's eyes 
 The first words ProtagonistA heard were ,  ProtagonistB is dead 
 ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's best friend 
 They had been through everything together 
 The doctors said that ProtagonistA would n't be able to speak or move ever again 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 The only thing ProtagonistA could do was think about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB had to act fast 
 ProtagonistB grabbed ProtagonistA by the tail and yanked ProtagonistA out of the park 
 The other newts hissed and retreated back into the undergrowth 
 ProtagonistB laid ProtagonistA down on the ground and tried to untangle ProtagonistA 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistB managed to get ProtagonistA's body back into some semblance of order 
 ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB had to get ProtagonistA to a hospital 
 ProtagonistB picked ProtagonistA up and started to run 
 From the start , ProtagonistB could tell that ProtagonistA was different 
 But ProtagonistB liked ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB was determined to help ProtagonistA make friends 
 Over the next few weeks , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA under ProtagonistB's wing 
 ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA around the school , introduced ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's friends , and helped ProtagonistA feel more comfortable 
 ProtagonistB was happy that ProtagonistB could help ProtagonistA feel welcome and accepted 
 It was the first time ProtagonistB realized that ProtagonistB had a talent for making friends and helping others feel comfortable in new situations 
 It was a skill that would serve ProtagonistB well throughout ProtagonistB's life 
ProtagonistB stood before ProtagonistA , and the breath was stilled before ProtagonistA 
 They had been friends since kindergarden , but now they were on opposite sides 
 ProtagonistB was a good man , a family man , and ProtagonistB had always been there for ProtagonistA 
 It was the only way 
 ProtagonistB's eyes widened in shock , but ProtagonistB did n't say anything 
 ProtagonistB just stood there 
 And so it was that ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA sitting in ProtagonistB's room , watching as ProtagonistB writhed in pain , ProtagonistB's eyes wide with terror 
 ProtagonistB's death was a tragedy , but it was also a wake - up call for ProtagonistA 
 The group has been a success , and ProtagonistA has helped many people come to terms with their own mortality 
 The poor tenants were living in squalor , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to help 
 ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA around the flat , and ProtagonistA was shocked by what ProtagonistA saw 
 The place was a mess , and the tenants were clearly struggling 
 The tenants were grateful , and soon the flat was looking much better 
There was once ProtagonistB 
 The only thing that was in ProtagonistA was a gas station and a grocery store 
 ProtagonistB's family was the only family who lived in ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB's mom worked at the gas station and ProtagonistB's dad worked at the grocery store 
 ProtagonistB went to school online because there was no school in ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was bored out of ProtagonistB's mind living in ProtagonistA 
 The only thing ProtagonistB had to do was go outside and explore 
 ProtagonistB would explore ProtagonistA and the surrounding area 
 ProtagonistB would find new things to do everyday to keep ProtagonistB entertained 
 One day , ProtagonistB found a cave that nobody knew about 
 ProtagonistB explored the cave and found a secret room that nobody else knew about 
 ProtagonistB was excited to have found something new 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistB's parents about the cave and they said ProtagonistB could go explore it as long as ProtagonistB was careful 
 ProtagonistB was happy to have something to do 
 ProtagonistB spent everyday exploring the cave and finding new things 
 ProtagonistB was happy living in ProtagonistA because ProtagonistB had something to do 
 ProtagonistA had been brought up in a small village and had never seen anything like the big city 
 The first thing ProtagonistA did was to go to the park 
 When ProtagonistA finally came out , it was getting dark 
 ProtagonistA was lost 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA ProtagonistA's name and where ProtagonistA lived 
 ProtagonistB was very kind and ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to the station 
 ProtagonistB called ProtagonistA's parents and they came to pick ProtagonistA up 
The boy in the striped tunic , who had looked almost exactly like a man , when ProtagonistA was five inches long , and five inches tall , and had fair hair , looked exactly like Bob , and in fact looked a great deal like a woman , at the time of ProtagonistA's first conception 
 ProtagonistB had been very beautiful , and very young , and ProtagonistB had died when ProtagonistA was only a few days old 
 ProtagonistC had been a very old man , and ProtagonistC had died when ProtagonistA was two years old 
 ProtagonistA had been brought up by ProtagonistA's grandparents , and ProtagonistA had never known ProtagonistB or ProtagonistC 
 When ProtagonistA was five years old , ProtagonistA's grandfather had died , and ProtagonistA's grandmother had died when ProtagonistA was seven 
 ProtagonistA had been sent to live in an orphanage then , and ProtagonistA had never seen ProtagonistA's grandparents ' house again 
 ProtagonistB had become a liability and ProtagonistA could n't take that risk 
 ProtagonistB gasped and ProtagonistA felt a pang of regret , but ProtagonistA knew it had to be done 
 It was a shame , really 
 ProtagonistB had been a good kid 
 But sometimes , tough decisions had to be made 
ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's early twenty - first year , had , in fact , the least to do , of all ProtagonistB's ladies of ProtagonistA's age , in the establishment of a palace for them at the point where the river Styx flows into the Thrym - yard 
 ProtagonistA had been sent there by the Queen with a small retinue of servants and a few handmaidens to help set up the household 
 The place was already prepared for them , with a large house and outbuildings , a garden , and a stable 
 The Queen had told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was to be the head of the household and that ProtagonistA's first task was to find a suitable husband for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC was a bit older than ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistC would be a good match for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC's name was John , and ProtagonistC was the son of a lord 
 ProtagonistC was a bit shy , but ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistC would be good for ProtagonistB 
 The wedding was a grand affair , and all of ProtagonistB's ladies were in attendance 
ProtagonistA was born and ProtagonistA was a boy , but ProtagonistA looked as if ProtagonistA had been shot 
 ProtagonistB was horrified when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's father was angry 
 The doctors said that there was nothing wrong with ProtagonistA and that ProtagonistA would be fine , but ProtagonistA's parents did n't believe them 
 They took ProtagonistA to a specialist who said that ProtagonistA had a rare condition that caused ProtagonistA to look like ProtagonistA had been shot 
 ProtagonistA's parents were relieved and they decided to keep ProtagonistA 
 It was a very sordid and infamous memory that ProtagonistA held onto 
 ProtagonistB always felt guilty about what ProtagonistB had done and tried to make it up to ProtagonistA in any way ProtagonistB could 
 One day , while they were out fishing in their boat , ProtagonistB had a heart attack and died 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 The secret was that ProtagonistA could turn invisible at will 
 But ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the idea of being able to disappear and go anywhere ProtagonistA wanted without being seen 
 The first few days at boarding school were tough for ProtagonistA 
 One day , while ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends were exploring the school grounds , they came across ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was muttering to ProtagonistB and seemed to be in a world of ProtagonistB's own 
 ProtagonistA's friends were scared and wanted to run away , but ProtagonistA felt sorry for ProtagonistB and decided to help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB replied that ProtagonistB was looking for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's heart skipped a beat 
 Could ProtagonistB somehow know about ProtagonistA's secret ability?The man went on to say that ProtagonistB had been searching for years for someone with this ability , as ProtagonistB believed that they could help ProtagonistB with a very important mission 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA would be willing to help ProtagonistB 
 They were both enjoying their meal when they heard a commotion coming from the lower end of the city 
 They both got up to see what was going on and saw a group of people running towards them 
 ProtagonistA's cousin said that they should go see what was going on , but ProtagonistA was hesitant 
 But ProtagonistA's cousin was insistent and eventually ProtagonistA relented 
 They made their way down to the lower end of the city and saw that a group of people were attacking ProtagonistB 
 They were beating ProtagonistB and kicking ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's cousin ran towards ProtagonistB to help ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA stayed back 
 But ProtagonistA's cousin was able to help ProtagonistB and eventually the attackers ran off 
 ProtagonistB was badly injured and ProtagonistA's cousin stayed with ProtagonistB to help ProtagonistB 
 It was during these dark nights that ProtagonistB would find ProtagonistA in the kitchen , eating whatever ProtagonistA could find , or in ProtagonistA's room , tearing at ProtagonistA's clothes and hair 
 ProtagonistB would try to talk to ProtagonistA , to reason with ProtagonistA , but it was as if ProtagonistA could n't hear ProtagonistB 
 It was during one of these dark nights that ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA in the kitchen , ProtagonistA's face covered in blood 
 ProtagonistB screamed when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA turned to look at ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's green eyes 
 ProtagonistB could see the madness in them , and ProtagonistB knew that there was nothing ProtagonistB could do to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB turned and ran from the kitchen , and ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB could hear ProtagonistA's footsteps behind ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was going to kill ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB ran into ProtagonistB's bedroom and locked the door , but ProtagonistA was already inside 
 ProtagonistB fought against ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB was no match for ProtagonistA's strength 
 ProtagonistB could feel ProtagonistB's life slipping away , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB was going to die 
 ProtagonistA let ProtagonistB go and ProtagonistB fell to the floor , gasping for breath 
 ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistA go downstairs and out the front door 
 ProtagonistB lay there for a moment , trying to catch ProtagonistB's breath , and then ProtagonistB got up and ran to the window 
 ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA walking down the street , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was going to kill again 
ProtagonistB had not expected to find ProtagonistA dead 
 ProtagonistB had been out for a walk in the woods when ProtagonistB came across ProtagonistA's body 
 ProtagonistA was lying on the ground , ProtagonistA's eyes open and staring up at the sky 
 There was a large pool of blood around ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistB did not know what to do 
 ProtagonistB stood there for a moment , unsure of what to do 
 Then ProtagonistB turned and ran back the way ProtagonistB had come 
 ProtagonistB did not want to be the one who found the body of ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been debating all day whether ProtagonistA wanted to go to the country inn or ProtagonistB's house 
 ProtagonistB was everything ProtagonistA had ever wanted in a man and more 
 ProtagonistB was kind , gentle , and loving , and ProtagonistB promised to always be faithful to ProtagonistA 
 For several years , everything was perfect between them 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken and devastated 
 ProtagonistB always had a smile on ProtagonistB's face and was always willing to help others 
 One day , when ProtagonistB was out playing with ProtagonistB's friends , ProtagonistB was hit by a car and killed 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 So that 's what ProtagonistA did 
The night ProtagonistA vanished was the night when ProtagonistA shared ProtagonistA's bed with ProtagonistB 
 It was also the night when ProtagonistB vanished 
 That 's why ProtagonistB did n't hesitate when ProtagonistA asked if ProtagonistB could share ProtagonistB's bed 
 But when ProtagonistB woke up the next morning , ProtagonistA was gone 
 There was no trace of ProtagonistA anywhere 
 ProtagonistB searched for ProtagonistA for weeks , but ProtagonistA was never seen again 
 Some people say that ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB both vanished into thin air 
 Others say that they were abducted by aliens 
 But no one knows for sure what happened to them 
 ProtagonistA was getting ready to retire , and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's wife had decided to move to Florida 
 They had sold their house and most of their belongings , and were planning to live off of ProtagonistA's pension 
 ProtagonistA's wife had died a few years before , and ProtagonistA was looking forward to finally being able to relax and enjoy ProtagonistA's retirement 
 When ProtagonistA got the call that ProtagonistB had died , ProtagonistA was shocked 
 ProtagonistC was all grown up now , and ProtagonistC was beautiful 
 They hugged each other and cried , and ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had come to the funeral 
 It was the last time they saw each other 
On Tuesday , Mr
 Bligh came to me at home with the news that ProtagonistA had been admitted into the College of the Holy - McPherson Priory , and that it would be five years before ProtagonistA would be able to see ProtagonistB 
 I was so excited for ProtagonistA and could n't wait to tell ProtagonistB the good news 
 I knew ProtagonistB would be just as excited as I was 
 So when ProtagonistA was admitted into the College of the Holy McPherson Priory , ProtagonistB was not surprised 
 But ProtagonistB was disappointed that ProtagonistB would not be able to see ProtagonistA for five years 
 Bligh had come to ProtagonistB with the news , and ProtagonistB was grateful to him for keeping ProtagonistB informed 
 But ProtagonistB could not help feeling a little sad 
 Now ProtagonistB would have to wait five years to see ProtagonistA again 
 But ProtagonistB was happy for ProtagonistA , and knew that ProtagonistA would do great things at the college 
Alive , eight days after the death of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA sat down to choose a subject of conversation with ProtagonistA's neighbour - the world 's most eminent apothecary , Doctor Joseph Vane - the world 's greatest chocolate connoisseur of the nineteenth century , Mr
 Belvedere of the Parisian street fly- and - supplies , Dr
 John Quartermaster - of the ship - whale Squadron Heterozone of the Navy - and indeed the world - famous spectacles - in - the - air , as ProtagonistA was giving the order of concealment to ProtagonistA's revolver and was about to read out the returning message of a dramatic undertone , which the man in question had written for her:-I am coming to murder you ! Go away , madman ! ' as the prompt 
 The doorbell rang 
 Bob , who had been expecting the arrival of the postman , got up to answer it 
 Without a word , the man raised his revolver and shot ProtagonistA in the head 
 As ProtagonistA lay dying on the floor , ProtagonistA's last thoughts were of ProtagonistB and how much ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB 
 It was literally the worst day of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistB was a big , burly man , and ProtagonistB was in a bad mood 
 ProtagonistB started shouting at ProtagonistA , and before ProtagonistA knew it , ProtagonistA was in a full - blown fight with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB punched ProtagonistA in the face , and ProtagonistA went down hard 
 But then , something miraculous happened 
 ProtagonistB stopped punching ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistB apologized for losing ProtagonistB's temper , and ProtagonistB even offered to buy ProtagonistA a drink 
 ProtagonistA was stunned 
 But from that day forward , the two men became friends 
 They would often meet up for a drink after work , and they would talk about their lives 
 ProtagonistB had always been a bit of an oddball , and ProtagonistC had always been a bit of a traditionalist 
 ProtagonistC did n't approve of ProtagonistB's eccentricities and ProtagonistC certainly did n't approve of ProtagonistB calling ProtagonistA  Madam 
 One day , ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA continued to call ProtagonistB  Madam 
 ProtagonistC was taken aback by ProtagonistA's response and ProtagonistC realized that ProtagonistC had been wrong about ProtagonistB all along 
 From then on , ProtagonistC started to see ProtagonistB in a different light and ProtagonistC even began to call ProtagonistB  Madam  ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB , hesitated for a moment before following ProtagonistA's lead 
 ProtagonistB sat at the table , not quite sure what to do 
 ProtagonistB looked around the room , taking in the pictures on the walls and the knick - knacks on the shelves 
 The two men ate in silence 
 ProtagonistB , however , was not used to being silent and soon started to chatter away 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life , ProtagonistB's job , ProtagonistB's family 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA in , and they talked long into the night 
 ProtagonistB learned that ProtagonistA was a wanderer , and that ProtagonistA had no home to go to 
 ProtagonistB offered ProtagonistA a place to stay , and ProtagonistA accepted 
 They became friends , and eventually lovers 
 ProtagonistB always wondered what happened to ProtagonistA , and if ProtagonistA ever thought of ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had only been married for three months when ProtagonistA died unexpectedly at ProtagonistA's home in Newton 
 The cause of death was complications from pregnancy 
 ProtagonistB was devastated 
 ProtagonistB was pregnant with their first child and had been looking forward to starting a family with ProtagonistA 
 Now ProtagonistB was left alone , with no husband and no child 
 ProtagonistB was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistA's death was a shock to everyone 
 ProtagonistA's death was a tragedy and ProtagonistB was never able to get over it 
 Even if it meant taking a life 
 ProtagonistB was the daughter of a rival gang leader , and if ProtagonistA did n't kill ProtagonistB's father , ProtagonistB would be forced to marry someone else 
 It was the only way to save ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was very grateful , and ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA liked the feeling of helping someone in need 
ProtagonistB had always been a bit odd , but ProtagonistA never really paid much attention to it 
 That is , until ProtagonistB started keeping rooks in their house 
 At first , ProtagonistA thought it was just a phase ProtagonistB was going through , but then ProtagonistB started getting more and more birds and started to neglect ProtagonistB's other hobbies 
 ProtagonistA tried to talk to ProtagonistB about it , but ProtagonistB just brushed ProtagonistA off , saying that it is what it is and that 's what ProtagonistB wants to do 
 Now , the house is full of birds and ProtagonistA ca n't stand it 
 The birds are everywhere , in every room , and they 're starting to drive ProtagonistA crazy 
 ProtagonistB tries to calm ProtagonistA down , but it 's too late , ProtagonistA 's already worked ProtagonistA up into a frenzy 
 ProtagonistB tries to stop ProtagonistA , but it 's too late , the damage is done 
 ProtagonistA 's destroyed ProtagonistB's hobby and ProtagonistB's life 's work and ProtagonistA ca n't take it back 
 ProtagonistB gasped and fell to the ground , dead 
 ProtagonistB was not dead , but merely in a deep sleep 
 ProtagonistB's spirit appeared before ProtagonistA , looking angry and disappointed 
 The damage was done 
 ProtagonistB cast a spell on ProtagonistA , turning ProtagonistA into a toad 
 And then ProtagonistB disappeared , leaving ProtagonistA alone to suffer the consequences of ProtagonistA's actions 
 ProtagonistA quickly told ProtagonistB what ProtagonistA had seen and ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would call the landlord 
 ProtagonistA was relieved that someone would take care of the problem 
 ProtagonistB was a beautiful baby girl 
 They named ProtagonistB's ProtagonistB 
 It was a great , wonderful day 
 ProtagonistB had a dream where ProtagonistB was just a girl and ProtagonistB was walking along in the garden , and suddenly a great wickedness smote ProtagonistB , and - now this is scary ! - and ProtagonistB was flying 
 In ProtagonistB's dream , ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA's body lying on the ground , and a great black bird was flying away 
 When ProtagonistB woke up , ProtagonistB was sweating and shaking 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA had been killed , and ProtagonistB was the only one who could have done it 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was destined to be a great hero , and that ProtagonistA would save the world from a terrible fate 
 ProtagonistB disappeared , and ProtagonistA was left alone in the city 
 ProtagonistB was tall and lanky , with golden hair and tawny eyes 
 Unfortunately , ProtagonistB was not excited to see ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB barely acknowledged ProtagonistA as ProtagonistB got out of the car and walked into the house 
 ProtagonistA's heart sank 
 ProtagonistB would go out with ProtagonistB's friends and come home late , barely speaking to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was hurt and disappointed , but ProtagonistA tried to understand 
 ProtagonistB finally opened up to ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was struggling with ProtagonistB's mental health 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
 They talked for hours , and ProtagonistA felt closer to ProtagonistB than ever before 
 They have a special bond that was forged through their shared experience 
To ProtagonistB is very nearly a treasure , and though it is not proper to discuss the disposition of ProtagonistA before ProtagonistA has attained to a certain age , I shall say that the owner of the house opposite to which I am now sitting , and of a certain age there never was a person who , till ProtagonistA had reached ProtagonistA's twenty - first birthday , could not plainly distinguish ProtagonistA – those persons were all strangers to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB , on the other hand , though ProtagonistB is not yet twenty - one , has known ProtagonistA for some years , and likes ProtagonistA very much 
 This act created a great rift in the empire , and ProtagonistA was forced to flee 
 ProtagonistB was a wise and just ruler , and ProtagonistB saw the value in ProtagonistA's knowledge and experience 
 ProtagonistB appointed ProtagonistA as ProtagonistB's chief advisor , and ProtagonistA served ProtagonistB faithfully for many years 
 And they had two children , and their names were Cain and Abel 
 And they were good children , and they loved their parents , and they were called Cain and Abel , because they were the first children of the world 
 And they were happy , and they loved each other , and they were good to each other , and they were called Cain and Abel , because they were the first children of the world 
 ProtagonistB was humiliated and laughed at by everyone who saw ProtagonistB 
Frank Wilson , an old friend and colleague of ProtagonistB's , once said ,  I am afraid , ProtagonistA , that when ProtagonistB is doing a little bit of necessary thing , you know all about it , and ProtagonistB 's got all sorts of things on ProtagonistB's conscience , but when ProtagonistB is doing all sorts of unnecessary thing , you never know what 's going on , you just know you 're used to it , and it 's when you 're doing a great deal of unnecessary thing that you really get into trouble 
Siskais will not have noticed that the very day when ProtagonistA was to enrol in ProtagonistA's first year of school , ProtagonistB had ProtagonistA sent to the London School of Economics 
 It was only when ProtagonistB received a letter from the school informing ProtagonistB of ProtagonistA's admission that ProtagonistB realised what had happened 
 ProtagonistB was overjoyed that ProtagonistA would be able to get a good education and make something of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been warned about the city , about the dangers that lurked in the shadows , but ProtagonistA had not been prepared for what ProtagonistA saw 
 The poverty , the filth , the crime 
 It was all too much 
 It sounded like it was coming from an alleyway just off the main street 
 ProtagonistB was cowering in fear , and it was clear that ProtagonistB was in trouble 
  Leave ProtagonistB alone 
 The men turned to look at ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA saw the hunger in their eyes 
 They were going to hurt ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA could n't let that happen 
 The men laughed and advanced on ProtagonistA 
 There was no way that ProtagonistA could fight all of them off 
 It was pointless 
 The man just brushed ProtagonistA aside and kept coming 
 ProtagonistA was knocked to the ground 
 The men were upon ProtagonistA now , kicking and punching ProtagonistA 
 Then , suddenly , they were gone 
 ProtagonistB had saved ProtagonistA 
 Then everything went black 
 Even ProtagonistA's teachers were impressed with ProtagonistA's intellect 
 One day , ProtagonistA's curiosity got the best of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA decided to ask ProtagonistC a question that had been bugging ProtagonistA for weeks 
  ProtagonistC , why is the sky blue ?  ProtagonistC was taken aback by the question , but ProtagonistC quickly recovered and explained the science behind it 
 It was a hot day and the sun was beating down on ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't mind 
 Suddenly , the front door opened and ProtagonistB came out 
 ProtagonistB was carrying a large suitcase and ProtagonistB looked very angry 
 What are ProtagonistA doing here ?  ProtagonistB demanded 
 It 's all right , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistC said 
 We 'll take care of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB hesitated for a moment , then nodded 
 All right ,  ProtagonistB said 
 With that , ProtagonistB turned and walked back into the house 
 Don't worry , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said 
  Everything will work out 
In the midst of the streets of Alexandria , in the year 1659 , ProtagonistA , not unnaturally , but simply by habit , but the more naturally , since ProtagonistA was the son of it , took up ProtagonistA's residence in a large and commodious house in the very centre of the city , and there , like a good landlord , ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB's name was Mrs
 But one day ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA and said to ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB am going to leave ProtagonistA 
   What for , ProtagonistB ?  said ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB am going to get married , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB 
  And who are ProtagonistB going to marry , ProtagonistB ?  said ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB am going to marry Mr
 Jones , the baker ,  said ProtagonistB 
  Very well , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistB will be happy 
The air grew still as ProtagonistA entered the main door of the old office , but ProtagonistA was ready 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said ,  but ProtagonistA 'm going to have to ask ProtagonistB to leave 
  ProtagonistB gasped and ran out of the room 
 Inside was a small office with a desk and a computer 
 It was the same look ProtagonistB always gave when ProtagonistB managed to get one over on someone 
 In this case , it was the other kids in ProtagonistA's class 
 They had been teasing ProtagonistA all day about ProtagonistA's new shoes , saying they were too big for ProtagonistA and that ProtagonistA looked like a clown 
 But ProtagonistB had told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could wear them with pride , because they were the latest style and ProtagonistA was ahead of the trends 
Barefoot lay by the side of ProtagonistB's house in the woods of Gower , where ProtagonistA had spent the good part of ProtagonistA's childhood , weeping heartily over ProtagonistB's death 
 The sun was setting , and the woods were beginning to fill with shadows 
 ProtagonistA was awakened by a rustling in the bushes 
 The creature took a step forward , and ProtagonistA scrambled to ProtagonistA's feet and ran as fast as ProtagonistA could back to ProtagonistB's house 
 Just then , ProtagonistB approached ProtagonistA and asked if ProtagonistA needed help 
 ProtagonistB was true to ProtagonistB's word and ProtagonistA made it home safely 
There were many things that ProtagonistA said that were not true , and some that ProtagonistA said that was not true , but there was one thing that ProtagonistA said or that ProtagonistA said or did or said or said that was true 
 It was true that ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB 
 This was a shock to ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA had always thought ProtagonistB was a good man 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA was not going to let ProtagonistB ruin ProtagonistA's cake 
 It was ProtagonistA's passion 
 But lately , something had been off 
 ProtagonistA's cakes were still delicious , but they were n't quite the same 
 They were missing that special something that made them ProtagonistA's cakes 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear ProtagonistB come up behind ProtagonistA 
 What are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked , ProtagonistB's voice dripping with disdain 
 You idiot !  ProtagonistB shouted 
 ProtagonistA was done with ProtagonistB 
 You're lucky ProtagonistB do n't have a wand , because ProtagonistB would hex ProtagonistA into oblivion ,  ProtagonistB spat 
 ProtagonistB turned and stormed out of the kitchen , leaving ProtagonistA standing there , victorious 
It was around eleven o'clock and it had been almost two months since ProtagonistB had died — three , in fact , if you include the time ProtagonistA 'd spent in temporary hospital and the time of great pain and suffering ProtagonistA 'd been through 
 Hello , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said , smiling 
  ProtagonistC hope ProtagonistA do n't mind ProtagonistC coming by , but ProtagonistC wanted to check on ProtagonistA and see how ProtagonistA 're doing 
 It was so nice to have someone to talk to who understood what ProtagonistA was going through 
 ProtagonistC stayed for a cup of tea , and when ProtagonistC left , ProtagonistA felt just a little bit better 
 It was around eleven o'clock , and though it had been a tough few months , ProtagonistA was slowly starting to heal 
 ProtagonistB was a million miles away , but ProtagonistB was the one who showed ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could be anything ProtagonistA wanted to be 
ProtagonistA's youth was spent following in ProtagonistA's brother 's footsteps 
 This made ProtagonistA happy and content in ProtagonistA's youth , but as ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to yearn for something more 
 It was n't until ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA finally found the courage to forge ProtagonistA's own path 
 ProtagonistA had been gone for weeks on a business trip and was now ready to relax 
 ProtagonistB , however , was not as pleased to see ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been dealing with the children and the household on ProtagonistB's own and was not in the mood to entertain ProtagonistA 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB had had enough 
 ProtagonistB stood up and told ProtagonistA to leave 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
 ProtagonistA had never been treated like this before 
ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA often 
 ProtagonistB's reason for living 
 And so it was with ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA's soft skin , ProtagonistA's gentle touch , and ProtagonistA's beautiful smile 
 ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA's smell , ProtagonistA's taste , and the way ProtagonistA made ProtagonistB feel 
 ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA's laugh , ProtagonistA's voice , and the way ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB dreamed of ProtagonistA's love , ProtagonistA's passion , and the way ProtagonistA made ProtagonistB feel alive 
It is to the great credit of ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA is now living 
 ProtagonistA's parents had died when ProtagonistA was young , and ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistA's grandparents 
 When they died , ProtagonistA was left alone in the world 
 ProtagonistB was a kind man who took ProtagonistA in and gave ProtagonistA a job 
 It was clear that ProtagonistB was lost and did n't know where ProtagonistB was going 
There was once an old farmer in Oxfordshire , now dead and gone , who had lived long enough to see the day when playthings had their proper uses — when industry , rather than mere wit , was the proper measure of man 's worth ; when the frivolous avocations of childish boys , once well nigh spent , had in their turn given place to the occupations which distinguished the most respectable members of society ; when the good sense of the courts of law had been fairly given due regard , so that many of those cases in which society had once regarded as frivolous or trivial — and this was for the most part , indeed , the case , in which the good sense of the law had not in any way sufficed , but which were , or at any rate were , fairly decided by an inexperienced judge , who was , or rather was , permitted to decide them , according to the rules of the game — such were the days of ProtagonistA , when , as ProtagonistA was often apt to say , it was a game of chance , ye good folk   ( ProtagonistA was well aware that what ProtagonistA was about to say was absolutely true)—and it was a game of chance , as well as a game of chance ; for , when ProtagonistB is in possession of a fortune , it is very seldom that ProtagonistB finds ProtagonistB in possession of nothing but ProtagonistB's own mind and the power of ProtagonistB's imagination ; but as a matter of fact , it is most often the case that ProtagonistB finds ProtagonistB in possession of a fortune , not only owing to circumstances of fortune , but owing to the power of ProtagonistB's imagination 
Hush , ProtagonistB , said the gleam in ProtagonistA's eyes as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB run barefoot through the streets of London 
 It was a cold night , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be cold and hungry by the time ProtagonistA got back to their squat 
 But ProtagonistB was new to the streets , and ProtagonistA had taken ProtagonistB under ProtagonistA's wing 
 ProtagonistB might not be able to take care of ProtagonistB yet , but ProtagonistB was a survivor 
 ProtagonistA's mother would scold ProtagonistA and tell ProtagonistA to come inside , but ProtagonistA never listened 
 ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA's car in the driveway and thought ProtagonistA might want some company ,  ProtagonistB said with a smile 
 It is said that ProtagonistA had thought ProtagonistA dead more times than ProtagonistA cared to remember 
 ProtagonistA was a lucky man , some would say 
 They had served together in the war and had been through everything together 
 But , one day , ProtagonistB was killed in action 
 But , the memories of war always haunted ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistC tried to help ProtagonistA , but there was nothing ProtagonistC could do 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA's memories became too much for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's own life 
 It is said that ProtagonistA's last words were  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistB had been best friends with ProtagonistA since they were in diapers 
 They had grown up together and now they were both in their early twenties 
 Now , it seemed like ProtagonistA was in over ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistB decided it was ProtagonistB's duty to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB went to talk to ProtagonistA's friends and tried to get them to convince ProtagonistA to get out of whatever ProtagonistA was involved in 
 But they were n't listening 
 ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB had to take matters into ProtagonistB's own hands 
 ProtagonistB went to talk to ProtagonistA and begged ProtagonistA to stop whatever ProtagonistA was doing 
 ProtagonistB had done ProtagonistB's duty as a friend and ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistA would be okay now 
A guest of honour called upon ProtagonistA and asked ProtagonistA to write a letter to ProtagonistB 
 It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining 
 ProtagonistB had died a few years ago , and ProtagonistA had taken over the farm 
 The farm was in good shape , but it was a lot of work for one person 
 ProtagonistC was eating some hay , and ProtagonistC looked up at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was used to getting looks of admiration from others , but ProtagonistB's look was different 
 It was as if ProtagonistB was looking at ProtagonistA with the same level of wonder and admiration that ProtagonistA felt when ProtagonistA looked at the world around ProtagonistA 
 It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever seen the light of day 
  Legends speak of a time when angels walked among men 
 It is said that when ProtagonistC was brought up in a house of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB came down from heaven to plead with ProtagonistA 
 It is said that ProtagonistB prevailed by ProtagonistB's grace and power upon the truth of ProtagonistB's pleadings 
 For of all the saints of the Gentiles , the most holy , and the most blessed , ProtagonistC was Frank 
 And yet , though raised unto heaven and set up as a star of justice , yet ProtagonistC was esteemed in the sight of ProtagonistA , not by ProtagonistC's own merit , but for the work that ProtagonistC had done 
 Neither was ProtagonistC despised in the sight of ProtagonistA : but ProtagonistC was exalted above all things , and was received with the most great privileges , even of ProtagonistA 
 And it came to pass , that ProtagonistC was esteemed a star , by one of the angels of ProtagonistA ; but before ProtagonistC was even named , ProtagonistC was already a star , and could alone be distinguished from all others 
ProtagonistB had been waiting for ProtagonistA at the house , but when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA walking along the road , ProtagonistB decided to drive ProtagonistA home 
 It was a hot summer day and the sky was so blue that it almost looked like a painting 
 The mountains in the distance were also white , making the whole scene look like something out of a postcard 
 When they got home , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to go inside and get some rest 
 But ProtagonistB was n't exactly what ProtagonistA had in mind 
 ProtagonistB was older than ProtagonistA , and not nearly as attractive as ProtagonistA would have liked 
 But ProtagonistB was wealthy , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could use ProtagonistB's money to ProtagonistA's advantage 
 And when ProtagonistB found out , ProtagonistB was furious 
 ProtagonistB demanded that ProtagonistA marry ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had no choice 
 And ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was retired and living in a small town in Florida 
 When ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was impressed by ProtagonistB's knowledge and ability to communicate with people 
 ProtagonistA was also impressed by the way ProtagonistB was able to help people who were in need 
 The old teacher had been kind to ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB was a boy , and had given ProtagonistB a book that had helped ProtagonistB to understand ProtagonistA's illness 
ProtagonistB never taught ProtagonistA to be a real man 
 ProtagonistB always told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was too soft , that ProtagonistA needed to be tougher if ProtagonistA wanted to make it in the world 
 ProtagonistB was a successful man , but ProtagonistB was also a cold and distant man 
 ProtagonistB never really showed ProtagonistA any affection , and ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was trying to live up to ProtagonistB's expectations 
 ProtagonistB died when ProtagonistA was still young , but ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA with a lot of money 
 ProtagonistB never taught ProtagonistA to be a real man , but in the end , ProtagonistA became a better man than ProtagonistB ever could have been 
 Every time ProtagonistA turned around , ProtagonistB was there , haunting ProtagonistA and making ProtagonistA's life a living hell 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistB was there , standing in front of ProtagonistA , looking as menacing as ever 
 ProtagonistA continued reading , louder and more forcefully , and with each word , ProtagonistB grew weaker and weaker until finally , ProtagonistB disappeared altogether 
 ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA's stories and would always beg for more 
 ProtagonistB's eyes lit up and ProtagonistB begged ProtagonistA to make one of ProtagonistA's stories come true 
 ProtagonistB was so excited that ProtagonistB could hardly contain ProtagonistB 
 That night , ProtagonistB went to bed early , eager to see what would happen in the morning 
 The next day , when ProtagonistB woke up , ProtagonistB raced to find ProtagonistA 
 In ProtagonistA's place was a note that said  Do n't worry , ProtagonistA's story is coming true 
 The boy did n't know what to think , but ProtagonistB was excited to see what would happen next 
 ProtagonistB waited all day , but nothing happened 
 ProtagonistB began to worry that maybe ProtagonistA's story was n't coming true after all 
 Just as ProtagonistB was about to give up hope , ProtagonistB heard a knock at the door 
 ProtagonistB opened it to find Bob , dressed in a spacesuit and holding a pinky index finger up to ProtagonistB 
  And now ProtagonistA 'm taking ProtagonistB on the adventure of a lifetime 
 ProtagonistB could n't believe it as ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB by the hand and led ProtagonistB out into the night 
 Soon they were blasting off into space , exploring the stars and having the time of their lives 
 ProtagonistB knew that as long as ProtagonistB had ProtagonistA by ProtagonistB's side , anything was possible 
 George J
 Heard stood in the door of ProtagonistB's house , had formed a considerable material interest 
 ProtagonistB had been a hard - working man all ProtagonistB's life , and ProtagonistB was not going to let ProtagonistA have all the fun 
 The table was set with a beautiful cake and presents , and the guests were all arriving 
 ProtagonistB was so surprised and happy to see all of ProtagonistB's friends and family there to celebrate with ProtagonistB 
 Nobody knows how long ProtagonistA was dead , but ProtagonistA had been dead for quite some time 
 ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by the afterlife 
 So , when ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistA could actually die and come back to life , ProtagonistA was intrigued 
 ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA's body and floated up into the sky 
 ProtagonistB then began to travel through the afterlife 
 ProtagonistB saw all sorts of things , and ProtagonistB met all sorts of people 
 ProtagonistB even met God 
 After what seemed like an eternity , ProtagonistB finally returned to ProtagonistA's body 
A whirlwind of joy washed over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistB took the first step of the day 
 They had planned to go fishing , and ProtagonistA was looking forward to spending some time with ProtagonistB and bonding over their shared love of fishing 
 As they made their way to the lake , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA stories of the times ProtagonistB had gone fishing with ProtagonistB's own father 
 ProtagonistA was so caught up in the moment that ProtagonistA did n't even realize they had arrived at the lake 
 ProtagonistB was soon by ProtagonistA's side , and they spent the next few hours chatting and fishing 
There was ProtagonistA 
 They talked for hours , until it was time for ProtagonistB to go 
 ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's number , and they parted ways 
 The doctors said there was nothing they could do 
 The cancer was too far gone 
 ProtagonistB was devastated 
 ProtagonistB had always been close to ProtagonistA , even though they did n't always see eye to eye 
 Now ProtagonistB was going to lose ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB decided to make the most of the time ProtagonistB had left 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA out to all ProtagonistA's favorite places 
 They went fishing , out to eat , and just spent time together 
 It was hard to see ProtagonistA declining day by day , but ProtagonistB was grateful for the time they had 
 ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB would cherish those memories forever 
 ProtagonistB had been a groundskeeper at the Yard for years , and ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA under ProtagonistB's wing 
 One day , ProtagonistB was injured while working on the grounds and had to be taken to the hospital 
 When ProtagonistB recovered , ProtagonistB was grateful to ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's help and offered to teach ProtagonistA everything ProtagonistB knew 
 It was a warm day in May and ProtagonistA had just finished ProtagonistA's last day of school 
 But ProtagonistB had other plans 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA to do something for ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA to go down to the city and deliver this package to Mr
 Johnson 
 No , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA to do this 
 It 's very important 
 Johnson 's address and knocked on the door 
 ProtagonistC answered and ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistC was very old and very frail 
 Is ProtagonistC Mr
 ProtagonistC nodded 
 ProtagonistC took the package and then invited ProtagonistA in 
 ProtagonistC offered ProtagonistA a seat and ProtagonistA sat down , feeling very uncomfortable 
 So , tell ProtagonistC about ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistC said 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistC about ProtagonistB and how ProtagonistB was a cold , hard - working , lonely widow 
 ProtagonistC listened intently and then ProtagonistC started to talk about ProtagonistC's own life 
 ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistD and how ProtagonistC had never been able to get over ProtagonistD's death 
 ProtagonistC was very grateful to ProtagonistA for listening to ProtagonistC and ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was a good son 
 ProtagonistC said that ProtagonistC was sure that ProtagonistB was very proud of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was so grateful that ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a big hug 
 ProtagonistB was a young man , and ProtagonistB was very impressed with ProtagonistA's garden 
 ProtagonistB had never seen anything like it before 
 ProtagonistB was very interested and asked a lot of questions 
 The priest said ,  No , ProtagonistA is not the Son of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA went to the mountaintop and prayed ,  ProtagonistC , are ProtagonistC the Son of ProtagonistB ?  A voice came from the clouds and said ,  Yes , ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC am the Son of ProtagonistB 
 It was going to be a great day 
 The store was empty except for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB put ProtagonistB's book down and looked at ProtagonistA 
  That will be a lot of money ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Are ProtagonistA sure ProtagonistA can afford it?Bob nodded 
  ProtagonistA 'm sure 
 ProtagonistB smiled 
  ProtagonistB 'm glad to see someone so passionate about reading ,  ProtagonistB said 
  This trunk of books is ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was the most beautiful girl ProtagonistA had ever seen , and ProtagonistB seemed to like ProtagonistA too 
 They started dating , and ProtagonistA was finally happy 
 First , ProtagonistA's parents had died in a car accident 
 Then , ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle had died in a house fire 
 ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's teacher 
 ProtagonistB had been trying to help ProtagonistA as much as ProtagonistB could , but ProtagonistB could tell that ProtagonistA was struggling 
 One day , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA had gone to see if ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle had any clothes left 
 It 's a pity , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  It 's a pity ProtagonistA did n't go and see if ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle had any clothes left 
 Then , ProtagonistA's boss chewed ProtagonistA out for being late 
 And to top it all off , ProtagonistA's car got a flat tire on the way home 
 ProtagonistB was always meowing and scratching at ProtagonistA's door , trying to get inside 
Guilt began to creep over ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA was twelve 
 It was the guilt of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's friends wanted to see what would happen if they put the bird in ProtagonistA's backpack 
 After ProtagonistB's death , ProtagonistA's father tried to fill the void by working even harder , but it was never the same 
  Why would ProtagonistA want ProtagonistA to do that ?  ProtagonistB was horrified 
 ProtagonistB had no idea what could have possessed ProtagonistA's friend to ask ProtagonistA to do such a thing 
  ProtagonistA is a good boy ,  ProtagonistB said 
  There must be some mistake 
 '  ProtagonistB was at a loss 
 ProtagonistB did n't know what to do 
 Should ProtagonistB go to the police ? But what if ProtagonistA was just mistaken ? ProtagonistB did n't want to get ProtagonistA in trouble if ProtagonistA was n't really guilty of anything 
 In the end , ProtagonistB decided to just talk to ProtagonistA ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB went to ProtagonistA's house and knocked on the door 
 ProtagonistB answered 
  Is ProtagonistA home ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 But ProtagonistB 'm not sure ProtagonistA wants to talk to ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Why not ?  ProtagonistB asked 
  ProtagonistA 's been acting strange lately 
 ProtagonistA 's been saying some really strange things 
  ProtagonistB was starting to get worried 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's time and went home 
 ProtagonistB had to talk to ProtagonistA and find out what was going on 
ProtagonistB was always the picture of calm and serenity 
 It was one of the things ProtagonistA loved about ProtagonistB 
 In the midst of a chaotic world , ProtagonistB was always able to find peace 
 ProtagonistB was quieter than usual and seemed to be lost in thought 
 After a moment 's hesitation , ProtagonistB confided in ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was worried about a family member who was ill 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB began to feel better 
I find it difficult to believe ProtagonistB ever did anything so bizarre as make ProtagonistA believe that ProtagonistA was immortal 
 It seems so out of character for ProtagonistB 
 I can remember when I was younger , ProtagonistB would always tell me that ProtagonistB needed to be careful with ProtagonistB's words because they could never be taken back 
 So , for ProtagonistB to tell ProtagonistA something like that , it must have been for a good reason 
 I can only imagine that ProtagonistB was trying to teach ProtagonistA a lesson about life 
 ProtagonistB was very sorry to see that ProtagonistA's work was not what ProtagonistB had hoped for , and ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA could recommend any other artists whose work ProtagonistB might like 
 But then , on the way out , ProtagonistB stopped ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's face was marked and ProtagonistA did n't have the faintest idea of how to make it look serious 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB did n't think ProtagonistA was ready for the job and that ProtagonistA should try again in a few years 
 ProtagonistA was crushed 
It was about twelve years ago , in the year of the twelfth moon , that ProtagonistA , after sitting on ProtagonistA's throne as though ProtagonistA had been sitting for days , died 
 The people of the kingdom were in mourning for ProtagonistA , and a new king had to be chosen 
 The council of elders met to discuss who would be the new king , and they decided on ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was a good man , and they thought ProtagonistB would be a good king 
 ProtagonistB was crowned the new king , and ProtagonistB ruled the kingdom well 
 ProtagonistB was a just and fair king , and the people loved ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB ruled for many years , and then he too died 
 Once again , the people were in mourning , and a new king had to be chosen 
 This time , the council of elders chose ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was a good king , but ProtagonistC was not as loved as ProtagonistB had been 
 ProtagonistC was a fair and just king , but the people did n't seem to connect with ProtagonistC the way they had with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC ruled for a few years , and then ProtagonistC too died 
 Once again , the people were in mourning , and a new king had to be chosen 
 This time , the council of elders chose ProtagonistD 
 ProtagonistD was a good king , but ProtagonistD was not as loved as ProtagonistD's father or grandfather had been 
 ProtagonistD was a fair and just king , but the people did n't seem to connect with ProtagonistD the way they had with ProtagonistB or ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistD ruled for a few years , and then he too died 
 And so it went , for twelve years , the cycle repeating itself over and over 
 The people of the kingdom were in mourning for ProtagonistA , and a new king had to be chosen 
 And each time , the new king was not as loved as the last 
One morning , however , the fantastic form of ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA had any idea what a plot was 
 Now , do ProtagonistA have any idea what the desired end of ProtagonistB's plot might be ?   ProtagonistA 'm afraid not , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 'm just a simple farmer , and ProtagonistA do n't know much about such things 
   Well , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB 'll tell ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB plan to take over the world !   The world !  said ProtagonistA 
  That 's a mighty big ambition , ProtagonistB 
 But why do ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA ?   ProtagonistB do n't need ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB ,  but ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA might like to help ProtagonistB 
 After all , it would be a great adventure , and ProtagonistA would be richly rewarded 
   ProtagonistA do n't know , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA 
  It sounds like a lot of trouble 
   Trouble !  said ProtagonistB 
  What do ProtagonistA mean , trouble ? There 's no trouble at all 
 It 's all been planned out 
 Everything is under control 
 There 's nothing to it but to do it !   ProtagonistA do n't know , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA 
  It all sounds very complicated to ProtagonistA 
   Complicated !  said ProtagonistB 
  It 's not complicated at all 
 It 's quite simple , really 
   ProtagonistA do n't know , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 'm just a simple farmer , and ProtagonistA do n't know anything about taking over the world 
   That 's all right , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB 'll teach ProtagonistA everything ProtagonistA need to know 
 Just have faith in ProtagonistB 
   All right , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA 
 You 're not going to believe it ,  said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA opened the stack of papers on the table 
 ProtagonistB was impressed with what ProtagonistA had put together , and ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA the go - ahead 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled , and ProtagonistA could n't wait to get started on ProtagonistA's project 
 It was finally happening , and ProtagonistA was going to make it a success 
Several hours before ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA had written to ProtagonistA's sister:I'm sorry ProtagonistA have n't been in touch more often 
 ProtagonistA know we 've grown apart over the years , but ProtagonistA still love ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistB can find it in ProtagonistB's heart to forgive ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB read the letter after ProtagonistA had passed away 
 ProtagonistB was surprised and touched by ProtagonistA's words 
 Even though they had n't been close , ProtagonistB still loved ProtagonistA and was glad ProtagonistA had reached out to ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's final moments 
ProtagonistB always said , if you put ProtagonistA on the moon , ProtagonistA would go crazy 
 ProtagonistB was always warning me about the dangers of space travel , but I never listened 
 I was determined to be the first person to walk on the moon , and nothing was going to stop me 
 We started making preparations right away 
 It took a lot of work , but we finally managed to get ProtagonistA to the moon 
 We rushed back into the spaceship to find ProtagonistA ranting and raving like a madman 
 ProtagonistA's eyes were wild and ProtagonistA's hair was standing on end 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA had gone crazy 
 ProtagonistB was right - space travel is dangerous 
 ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as Sarah , and said that ProtagonistB was a friend of ProtagonistA's son 
 ProtagonistA's son had told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was a bit of a recluse and never left the house , so ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistB would come and visit ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was pleased to have a visitor and they spent the next few hours chatting and getting to know each other 
 ProtagonistB was a very special dog because ProtagonistB could talk 
 ProtagonistC was so powerful that ProtagonistC could make anything ProtagonistC wanted come true 
 ProtagonistB was very interested in ProtagonistC and asked ProtagonistA to take ProtagonistB to meet ProtagonistC 
 After a long journey , they finally arrived at ProtagonistC's castle 
 ProtagonistC was very pleased to meet them and agreed to grant ProtagonistB one wish 
 ProtagonistB thought for a moment and then said ,  ProtagonistB wish ProtagonistB could talk like ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistC granted ProtagonistB's wish and ProtagonistB was able to talk like ProtagonistA from then on 
 The three of them talked long into the night about all sorts of things 
 ProtagonistB was very happy to have found such a good friend in ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB had a grave look on ProtagonistB's face and ProtagonistA knew that something was wrong 
 It 's ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistB replied 
  ProtagonistC 's given the order to kill ProtagonistD 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
 I know ,  ProtagonistB replied 
  But what can we do ? We 're just two people 
  If we can get to ProtagonistD before ProtagonistC's men do , we can save ProtagonistD's life 
 ProtagonistB nodded 
 It was risky , but it was the only chance they had 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB set out into the night , making their way to ProtagonistD's residence 
 They were careful to avoid any of ProtagonistC's men , and they made it to ProtagonistD's house without incident 
 Thank ProtagonistA for warning ProtagonistD ,  ProtagonistD said 
  ProtagonistD will be sure to leave the city immediately 
 But before they could take more than a few steps , they were surrounded by ProtagonistC's men 
 I'm sorry , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But it looks like we 're too late 
 The men grabbed ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's mother and dragged them back to ProtagonistC's headquarters 
 ProtagonistA's hand trembled as ProtagonistA pulled the knife from ProtagonistA's pocket 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and ran towards ProtagonistB , knife raised 
 ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA coming and laughed 
 ProtagonistB pulled out ProtagonistB's own knife and ran towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB stabbed ProtagonistA in the stomach and ProtagonistA fell to the ground , gasping for breath 
 The last thing ProtagonistA saw before ProtagonistA died was ProtagonistB's face , laughing at ProtagonistA 
I am the earliest member of the family whose great- grandfather was a man named Charles Charles George George William II , who came to America in 1755 , and established in New York a church , so called because it was given by ProtagonistA by ProtagonistA's immediate family , and , in which ProtagonistA was pastor , that ProtagonistA may have been authorized in the church , by the bishop , to baptize believers , in behalf of others in need ; and it appears from the genealogical roll of the church , that ProtagonistB was named Jane , or Jane Simpson , and ProtagonistB entered into he with great solemnity , and without any hesitation ; and ProtagonistB married Jane , who was second wife to a distinguished cousin , a gentleman of good position , named Charles Charles , of Wapping , who was afterwards lord of the borough of Harlem ; and although ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB to be an innocent wife , yet ProtagonistB tried to prevent ProtagonistB from marrying , either because ProtagonistB was under fifteen years of age , or else because ProtagonistB was already of marriageable age ; because without Frank 's knowledge , and without ProtagonistB's grandmother 's consultation , ProtagonistB had died , without a word from ProtagonistB , of an accidental overdose of opium , which ProtagonistB had been prescribed for ProtagonistB's ill health 
Bob , says that although ProtagonistA was born in the year 1646 , ProtagonistA has never heard of a time when ProtagonistA had not heard of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB is one Mr
 John Smith , who was born in the year 1632 
After ProtagonistA was married to ProtagonistB the toys were gone and when ProtagonistA woke up ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a tiny room colored a bright crimson against a pale blue sky 
 ProtagonistA was confused at first , but then ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was in a dream 
 They were both happy to see ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was finally free from ProtagonistA's nightmare 
 ProtagonistB had already destroyed the world 
 It was the voice of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was laughing at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was laughing at ProtagonistA for being a hero 
ProtagonistA was born in the beginning , and ProtagonistA was called Adam 
 Together , they created a family and a life 
 They were happy and content 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 They were always together , and everyone could see how happy they were 
 One day , ProtagonistB was diagnosed with a rare and incurable disease 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB passed away 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 It was like ProtagonistB was still with ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistA mean , look at all this stuff 
 It 's just a bunch of useless paper 
 People used to come to the library to read and learn 
 Now , they just came to browse the internet or play on the computers 
 I do n't know , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB think there 's still a lot of good in the world 
 People just need to be reminded of it sometimes 
 Maybe ProtagonistB was right 
 Maybe the world was n't as bad as ProtagonistA thought 
 Maybe there was still some good left in it 
 ProtagonistA was smitten 
 ProtagonistB accepted , and ProtagonistA was thrilled 
 ProtagonistB was impressed , and they had a great time together 
 ProtagonistB , had been planning your death for months 
 ProtagonistB had hired assassins and mercenaries to do the job , but they had all failed 
 Finally , ProtagonistB decided to do it ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB cast a powerful spell that would kill you instantly 
 The smooth , sweet liquid slid down ProtagonistA's throat , warming ProtagonistA from the inside out 
 ProtagonistB's eyes were filled with desire and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would n't be able to resist ProtagonistB much longer 
 ProtagonistB welcomed ProtagonistA into ProtagonistB's arms , and they spent the rest of the night exploring each other 's bodies 
 There was a delivery man standing there with a package for ProtagonistA 
This is the story of what happens when ProtagonistA , thinks ProtagonistA knows everything 
 ProtagonistB fires ProtagonistA on the spot 
 ProtagonistA is stunned 
 But ProtagonistB is a cruel mistress , and ProtagonistB decided to take ProtagonistA away from this world far too soon 
 It was a tragic accident , and ProtagonistA did n't even see it coming 
 It was a senseless act that took away ProtagonistA from this world , and everyone who knew ProtagonistA was devastated 
 So when the Duchess of Marlborough died and ProtagonistA was given the succession of the Spanish dominions , ProtagonistA was thrilled 
 ProtagonistB was a great ruler and ProtagonistB was confident that under ProtagonistB's guidance , ProtagonistA would be able to build a powerful empire 
 ProtagonistA's dream was finally becoming a reality 
 And eventually , ProtagonistA's dream came true 
 There was ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB looked suspicious 
 They arrested ProtagonistB and took ProtagonistB away , and ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief 
 It was the ninth day of the new year , and ProtagonistA had just saved ProtagonistA's town from a potential disaster 
 It was a comfortable chair , and it had been in the family for generations 
 ProtagonistB had been a big man , and the chair had been made to accommodate ProtagonistB 
 The chair had seen a lot of history , and it had been witness to a lot of important events 
 It had been in the room when ProtagonistA's great - grandfather had been born , and it had been in the room when ProtagonistA's great - grandmother had passed away 
 It had been there for all of the happy times and all of the sad times 
 And now , it was there for ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA studied for ProtagonistA's exams 
 ProtagonistB had never seen a man so well put together 
 ProtagonistB felt like ProtagonistB was the only woman in the world 
  ProtagonistA 'm the captain of this ship 
 ProtagonistB felt like ProtagonistB was going to faint 
 ProtagonistB had never been this close to a man before 
 ProtagonistB felt like ProtagonistB could feel the power emanating from ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB felt safe and protected 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB could trust ProtagonistA 
 I'm Sarah ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm the first mate 
 ProtagonistB did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistB was completely overwhelmed 
 ProtagonistB was shocked 
 ProtagonistB had never expected this 
 But ProtagonistB realized that ProtagonistB felt the same way 
 ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB would do anything for ProtagonistA 
 Yes , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB will be ProtagonistA's wife 
 ProtagonistB had always been a bit of a recluse , and ProtagonistB had always warned ProtagonistA not to go near the old house 
 But , curiosity got the best of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA sneaking around the property 
 It was as if someone was watching ProtagonistA 
 The house was musty and dark , and it felt like something was stalking ProtagonistA 
 It was as if something was holding ProtagonistA there 
 ProtagonistA was trapped 
 ProtagonistA always felt out of place in ProtagonistA's small town , like ProtagonistA was meant for something more 
 ProtagonistA's dream was to move to the city and become a model 
 ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA's town and saw ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was impressed by ProtagonistA's looks and offered ProtagonistA a contract on the spot 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled and packed ProtagonistA's bags for the city 
 The constant partying and superficial conversations were taking their toll 
That night ProtagonistA was in a state of profound confusion , for ProtagonistA had seen a vision , and ProtagonistA had been cast into the midst of a great and terrible mystery 
 ProtagonistB's name was Sarah , and ProtagonistB was the one who would save them all 
 They chatted easily as they strolled along , and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA telling ProtagonistB all about ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistB listened intently , and when ProtagonistA had finished , ProtagonistB simply said ,  It sounds like ProtagonistA 're looking for something 
 ProtagonistB smiled knowingly and said ,  ProtagonistB think ProtagonistB can help ProtagonistA find what ProtagonistA 're looking for 
 Come with ProtagonistB 
 And ProtagonistB was right 
 ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA to a small park that was tucked away in a quiet corner of the city 
 They sat down on a bench , and ProtagonistB said ,  Close ProtagonistA's eyes and imagine the life ProtagonistA want to live 
 Visualize it as vividly as ProtagonistA can 
 ProtagonistA was surrounded by family and friends , and ProtagonistA felt happier than ProtagonistA had ever felt before 
 When ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes , ProtagonistB was gone , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget the moment that ProtagonistA had found what ProtagonistA had been searching for all ProtagonistA's life 
When ProtagonistA leaves ProtagonistA's home ProtagonistA has but one thing to lose : ProtagonistA's virginity 
 ProtagonistA 's heard so much about sex and ProtagonistA 's ready to finally experience it for ProtagonistA 
 They go back to ProtagonistB's place and things start to get hot and heavy 
 ProtagonistA panics and tells ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA has to go back and get it 
 ProtagonistB 's obviously disappointed , but ProtagonistA is relieved 
 ProtagonistB was different from any woman ProtagonistA had ever met 
 ProtagonistB was kind and gentle and ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA feel things ProtagonistA had never felt before 
This is a story about a man who must be kept from knowing , because it would kill ProtagonistA , that ProtagonistC , could be alive and always be looking for ProtagonistA 
 But one day , ProtagonistB was killed in a robbery gone wrong 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 The police could never find ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was alive and well 
 And ProtagonistC was always looking for ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistC found ProtagonistA 
 And ProtagonistC would have killed ProtagonistA too , if ProtagonistA had n't been prepared 
 It was a cold winter day when ProtagonistB passed away 
 ProtagonistB was a cruel woman , who never showed ProtagonistA any kindness 
 Even on ProtagonistB's deathbed , ProtagonistB refused to see ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had a kind face and ProtagonistA felt drawn to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was not alone and that ProtagonistC was real 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA just needed to have faith and keep praying 
It was Christmas time in the year of our Lord 1662 and ProtagonistA was sitting down at the first coffee - table conversation of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had been invited by ProtagonistB , to join ProtagonistB and some others for a cup of coffee and some light conversation 
The sun rose slowly , but in the midst of all the misery of the city , which was then , and for a long time afterwards , a fine and flourishing town , there rose a little meek , innocent - looking girl of about sixteen or seventeen years of age , who seemed to have been driven into a very inconvenient position during the war ; and for the most part it was the fault of ProtagonistA's parents , who were not at all happy , poor , or otherwise about ProtagonistA , in the least 
 ProtagonistB's name was Betty , and ProtagonistB had been living with ProtagonistC in the city ever since ProtagonistB could remember ; but ProtagonistB's parents had died when ProtagonistB was quite young , and ProtagonistB knew nothing about them 
 ProtagonistC was a good woman , but ProtagonistC was very poor , and could not do much for ProtagonistB 
 The war had made things worse , and now they were both living in a little attic room , which was all they could afford 
 ProtagonistB was a quiet , gentle creature , who never complained , and always tried to make the best of things ; but ProtagonistB was very lonely , and often longed for someone to love ProtagonistB and care for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB had never had any friends , as ProtagonistB was too shy to make any ; and the only person who had ever shown ProtagonistB any kindness was ProtagonistA 
 One day , when ProtagonistB was sitting alone in ProtagonistB's room , ProtagonistB heard a loud noise downstairs , and then a crash 
 ProtagonistB ran to the window , and saw ProtagonistA in the street below , with a broken window behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB's heart sank , as ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA would be in trouble again ; but ProtagonistB was not prepared for what happened next 
 ProtagonistA was arrested and taken to prison , and ProtagonistB never saw ProtagonistA again 
 ProtagonistB heard that ProtagonistA had been sentenced to death , and ProtagonistB could not believe it 
 ProtagonistB was sure that there must be some mistake , and that ProtagonistA would be set free ; but the days went by , and there was no news 
 At last , the day came when ProtagonistB was to see ProtagonistA again ; but it was not the happy meeting that ProtagonistB had dreamed of 
 ProtagonistA was brought out to be executed , and ProtagonistB was there to witness it 
 ProtagonistB was heartbroken , and could not understand why such a cruel fate had befallen ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistB watched ProtagonistA die , ProtagonistB could not help wondering if there might not have been some other way ; but ProtagonistB knew that it was too late now , and ProtagonistA was gone forever 
 ProtagonistB had been upon ProtagonistA's account at the same time as the marriage 
 ProtagonistB said that it would help take ProtagonistB's mind off of the fact that their parents were no longer alive 
 It was getting late , and the innkeeper told them that they needed to leave 
 ProtagonistB was very drunk by this point , and ProtagonistB stumbled as they walked out 
 ProtagonistA's husband managed to catch ProtagonistB and helped ProtagonistB into the car 
 They drove home , and ProtagonistB fell asleep in the backseat 
 ProtagonistA's husband looked over at ProtagonistA and asked if ProtagonistA was going to be okay 
 The next morning , ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistB had left a note saying that ProtagonistB was sorry , but ProtagonistB could n't stay there any longer 
 ProtagonistA's husband tried to comfort ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA just could n't shake the feeling that ProtagonistB had left because of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB entered , looking around with a confused expression 
 When ProtagonistB's eyes met ProtagonistA's , ProtagonistB let out a small gasp and took a step back 
 I'm sorry ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB thought this was ProtagonistB's compartment 
 The woman hesitated for a moment before sitting down across from ProtagonistA 
 I'm Lily ,  ProtagonistB said , shaking ProtagonistA's hand 
 They made small talk for a while , talking about where they were going and what they did for a living 
 Eventually , they ended up in a passionate embrace and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had found something special 
 ProtagonistA's only son , Bob , had died in a car accident two years ago 
 This left ProtagonistA with only ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA's grandchildren , whom ProtagonistA loved dearly 
 It was a time for ProtagonistA to catch up with ProtagonistA's family and enjoy a good meal 
 But this Sunday was different 
 ProtagonistB was very quiet and would not meet ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was leaving ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had met someone else and was moving away 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 But ProtagonistB was determined to go 
 ProtagonistB packed ProtagonistB's bags and left 
 ProtagonistA was left alone with ProtagonistA's memories 
 They were the only family ProtagonistA had left 
 ProtagonistA smiled and went inside , where ProtagonistA was greeted by ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's cat , Snuggles 
 When ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA a story about a time when ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's age and went on a hike with ProtagonistB's friends 
 ProtagonistA's hair was disheveled and ProtagonistA's eyes were red and swollen 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA had been crying 
 Suddenly , the door to the room opened and ProtagonistB walked in 
 ProtagonistB came over to ProtagonistA and knelt down beside ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA , what 's wrong ?  ProtagonistB asked gently 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 'm so sorry 
 ProtagonistB wrapped ProtagonistB's arms around ProtagonistA and held ProtagonistA close 
  It 's okay , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said soothingly 
  It 's not the end of the world 
 We 'll just have to help ProtagonistA study more for the next one 
 It was n't the end of the world 
 But it sure felt like it 
 ProtagonistB was in the kitchen cooking dinner when the phone rang 
 After ProtagonistB hung up the phone , ProtagonistB came into the living room and sat down next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC had been in a car accident and ProtagonistC was gone 
Less than an hour after the end of the year , ProtagonistA was found murdered in ProtagonistA's apartment , ProtagonistA's throat slit 
 The police were called and they began their investigation 
 They found that ProtagonistA had been having an affair with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was married and ProtagonistC had found out about the affair 
 ProtagonistC was the one who killed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been brought up by ProtagonistA's father and mother in a small village in the north of England , and had never been taught anything but to be a good - natured , happy - go - lucky girl 
 But ProtagonistA's father had died when ProtagonistA was ten years old , and ProtagonistB had married again , and ProtagonistA had been sent to live with ProtagonistA's stepfather in a large town 
 Here ProtagonistA had been put to work in a factory , and had soon become discontented and unhappy 
 The only thing that had kept ProtagonistA from leaving home and going out into the world to seek ProtagonistA's fortune was ProtagonistB's entreaties that ProtagonistA would not desert ProtagonistB 
 But at last ProtagonistA's stepfather had turned ProtagonistA out of doors , and ProtagonistA had been obliged to wander forth into the world to seek ProtagonistA's fortune 
Now , what is it ? said ProtagonistC to the old woman who lay on ProtagonistA back in a critical state , trying to escape the vault with ProtagonistA's head down , as if ProtagonistA had suddenly realized what it was ProtagonistA had been planning 
 It 's the TARDIS ,  ProtagonistB gasped 
  ProtagonistB 've been trying to tell ProtagonistC 
 The TARDIS is in the vault 
 The Doctor 's eyes widened 
  The TARDIS ? But how?I do n't know ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But it 's there 
 ProtagonistB can feel it 
 The Doctor hesitated for a moment , then nodded 
  All right 
 ProtagonistC 'll go take a look 
 ProtagonistC turned to ProtagonistA 
  Can ProtagonistA carry ProtagonistA nodded , and ProtagonistC lifted ProtagonistB onto ProtagonistA's back 
 Be careful ,  ProtagonistB said 
  The TARDIS is 
 alive 
 The Doctor nodded again , then turned and ran back into the vault 
 They could hear ProtagonistC's voice echoing through the vault as ProtagonistC called out to the TARDIS
Suddenly , there was a blinding flash of light , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistB go limp in ProtagonistA's arms 
 ProtagonistC came running back out of the vault , a look of shock on ProtagonistC's face 
 I'm not sure ,  ProtagonistC said ,  but ProtagonistC think the TARDIS is gone 
  ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA sympathetically 
  ProtagonistB know , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
ProtagonistB had known ProtagonistA since they were both in diapers 
 They had grown up together and been through everything together 
 When their parents died , it was ProtagonistA who stepped up and took care of ProtagonistB 
 Now , ProtagonistB was the one who was there for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB wanted to help ProtagonistA through this tough time , just like ProtagonistA had helped ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB wanted to be the one person ProtagonistA could rely on , just like ProtagonistA had been the one person ProtagonistB could always rely on 
 But then , one day , something happened that changed ProtagonistA forever 
 ProtagonistB , was crying 
 ProtagonistB was so sad and ProtagonistA felt terrible 
The sun rose red in the sky , and ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's gleaming blue eyes bored into the dark depths of the ocean , a sight ProtagonistB had surely seen many times before 
 But to ProtagonistA , it was new and exciting , and ProtagonistA could n't help but stare 
 ProtagonistB , seeing ProtagonistA's fascination , came over and explained what ProtagonistB was looking at 
 The ocean , ProtagonistB said , was full of life , even down in the dark depths where the sun could n't reach 
 They were on their way to pick up ProtagonistA's sister from school 
 Suddenly , the coach came to a stop 
 ProtagonistB got out to see what was happening 
 ProtagonistC was trying to fix it , but ProtagonistC could n't 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistC if ProtagonistC could take them to the nearest house 
 ProtagonistC said ProtagonistC could and ProtagonistB got back in the coach with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistC took them to a big house 
 ProtagonistD came to the door and ProtagonistB asked if ProtagonistB could use ProtagonistB's phone 
 ProtagonistD said ProtagonistD could and ProtagonistB went inside with ProtagonistD 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistB came back out and said they were going to have to wait for a while for ProtagonistA's sister 
 ProtagonistB was a man who was in a relationship with a woman , and they had a child together 
 ProtagonistB was a man who was successful in ProtagonistB's career , and ProtagonistB was a man who was happy with ProtagonistB's life 
 It was a cold winter day and ProtagonistB had been lying in the snow for hours 
 ProtagonistB's skin was pale and ProtagonistB's eyes were glassy 
 ProtagonistA's hair stirred and ProtagonistA's face grew red and pouted 
 ProtagonistA's eyes flashed with fear and ProtagonistA put out a soft smile that had the air of a quarter 
 ProtagonistB was getting closer and ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was a woman 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a white dress and ProtagonistB's hair was blowing in the wind 
 ProtagonistB reached out ProtagonistB's hand and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA being pulled towards ProtagonistB 
 The last thing ProtagonistA saw was ProtagonistB's cold , dead eyes before ProtagonistA was pulled into the darkness 
It was nt any of ProtagonistB business , and could have easily gone either way , but when ProtagonistA was walking hand in hand with a dead man ProtagonistA felt a strong urge to help 
 It was a hot day and the sun was beating down mercilessly 
 ProtagonistB could see that ProtagonistA was in a bad way and ProtagonistB felt compelled to do something 
 ProtagonistB approached the pair and offered to help 
 ProtagonistB stayed with ProtagonistA until ProtagonistA felt better and then went on ProtagonistB's way 
 ProtagonistA's son , Bob , had been left in the care of the parsonage by his father and ProtagonistA was very grateful for that 
 Duryea , on the other hand , was not as close to ProtagonistC's brother as ProtagonistA was to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistC felt that ProtagonistB had always been a bit of a reckless adventurer and that ProtagonistB's death was not entirely unexpected 
 Nevertheless , ProtagonistC was still saddened by the loss and offered ProtagonistC's condolences to ProtagonistA 
 The two of them continued to sit in the parlor , talking about ProtagonistB and their shared memories of ProtagonistB 
 As they talked , they began to feel closer to each other and by the end of the conversation , they were both feeling much better 
ProtagonistA's friends called ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB would not cast a glance aside , for ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA ! They had been married for 5 years , and in that time , ProtagonistA had never once looked at another man 
 However , one day , ProtagonistA's friends convinced ProtagonistA to go to a gay bar with them 
 ProtagonistC was tall , muscular , and had the most beautiful blue eyes ProtagonistA had ever seen 
 ProtagonistC was also completely naked , save for a small pair of black shorts 
 ProtagonistA's friends called out to ProtagonistC 
 They stripped each other down and made love all night long 
 It was a cold day and the village was covered in snow 
 ProtagonistB was excited to see ProtagonistA and ran to ProtagonistA 
 They hugged each other and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA how much ProtagonistB had missed ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB had always been a strong man , but now ProtagonistB was getting old and frail 
 ProtagonistB did n't want ProtagonistA to die , so ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA on the shore with some food and water 
 & SONS , PAINTERS AND DECORATORS 
 What is it , ProtagonistA ?  asked ProtagonistB , when ProtagonistB had shut the door of the little office 
 I'm in trouble , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistC is very ill , and the doctor says ProtagonistC must have proper nursing 
 Friend thought for a moment 
 Then ProtagonistB said :  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'll tell ProtagonistA what ProtagonistB 'll do 
 ProtagonistB 'll give ProtagonistA a month 's holiday , with full pay 
 And when ProtagonistA come back , ProtagonistB 'll give ProtagonistA a rise of two shillings a week 
 That will help ProtagonistA to pay for the nursing 
 ProtagonistA's face brightened 
  That 's very good of ProtagonistB 
 And from that day ProtagonistA was a better workman than ever , for ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was a kind and considerate man 
ProtagonistA had been born , with all the tender feelings and memories which ProtagonistA could bear , ProtagonistA in the year of grace 1792 , to ProtagonistB the 15th of July , in the parish of St
 dernier - sur - Marne , in the town of Port Omega , in the district of the Madonnier family 
 ProtagonistA was loved by all who met ProtagonistA , and it was clear that ProtagonistA was destined for great things 
 In the year of grace 1792 , tragedy struck the Madonnier family 
 ProtagonistB , was killed in a hunting accident , leaving ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's mother , Marie , devastated 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB got angry with ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA to go to bed 
ProtagonistA was seated on the steps of the throne in the center of the court , ProtagonistA's face pale and ProtagonistA's eyes trembling as ProtagonistA looked down at the golden blade of Agredite in the hands of ProtagonistB 
 It was a moment ProtagonistA had been dreading for months , ever since ProtagonistA's father had announced ProtagonistA's engagement to ProtagonistB 
 The ceremony began , and ProtagonistA could do nothing but watch as ProtagonistB pledged ProtagonistB's life to ProtagonistA 
 When it was over , they were both escorted to their separate chambers 
 First , ProtagonistA got scolded by ProtagonistA's boss at work 
 And to top it all off , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB would not be able to help ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's financial problems 
 So when ProtagonistA stepped to the lectern , ProtagonistB did not interrupt ProtagonistA's position 
 ProtagonistB just stood there and listened 
 And when ProtagonistA was done , ProtagonistB applauded 
 ProtagonistB was a beautiful , snake - like creature who did n't seem to understand emotions either 
 One day , they decided to go on an adventure 
 They went to a place where there were no humans and they could be themselves 
 They had a wonderful time , and when they returned back to the real world , they both felt more understood and accepted 
 ProtagonistB was so old that ProtagonistB's skin was almost transparent , and ProtagonistB's eyes were milky white 
 ProtagonistB was sitting in a large chair , and ProtagonistB's hands were shaking 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had been alive for centuries , and that ProtagonistB had seen the rise and fall of many empires 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB was ready to die , and that ProtagonistB wanted ProtagonistA to kill ProtagonistB 
 As ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for ending ProtagonistB's life 
  ProtagonistB , on hearing this , was much astonished , and asked ProtagonistA what could induce ProtagonistB to think that this was the true religion , when there were so many others in the world 
It was a beautiful good day in October when ProtagonistA trod into the garden and saw ProtagonistB 
 They had not seen each other since ProtagonistB had left home to marry ProtagonistB's husband , John 
 ProtagonistB was overjoyed to see ProtagonistA and they hugged each other tightly 
 They chatted for a while , catching up on all that had happened in the intervening years 
 It was a beautiful day in October and the sun shone down on the two siblings as they caught up on all that had happened in their lives 
 ProtagonistA had been sentenced to life in prison for a crime ProtagonistA did n't commit 
 Suddenly , the door to ProtagonistA's cell opened 
 ProtagonistB was beautiful and had a kind face 
 Hi , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB's name is ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB 'm here to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was confused 
 ProtagonistB know ProtagonistA 're innocent ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm going to help ProtagonistA get out of here 
In the year 1853 , ProtagonistC was born under the week of ProtagonistA's hair being put on ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistB found that ProtagonistA was interested in the matter , but ProtagonistB had never before encountered this in ProtagonistB's life and had no idea of the purpose of the conduct 
 ProtagonistB was deceived into believing that ProtagonistC's affairs were in proper hands 
The first time ProtagonistA raised the dead was in a remarkably unscientific way , by which ProtagonistA meant by the ' oldest work of art of all the earth ' 
 It was how ProtagonistA had coped with their loss 
 There was ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was desperate to speak to ProtagonistC one last time 
At the turn of the last century , when Europe was drifting apart , there lived ProtagonistA , and by the name of Caroline Caroline , or Caroline of Mary , ProtagonistA was called 
 ProtagonistA was born in England , in a small town near the Scottish border , and ProtagonistA grew up there , in a house by the sea 
 ProtagonistA's father was a fisherman , and ProtagonistB was a seamstress 
 When ProtagonistA was ten years old , ProtagonistA's father died in a fishing accident , and ProtagonistB had to take in sewing to make ends meet 
 They had two children , a boy and a girl 
 They would build sandcastles , and then they would run to the waves and jump in , just like ProtagonistA had done when ProtagonistA was a child 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistC died suddenly , and ProtagonistA was left alone with ProtagonistA's children 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be strong for ProtagonistA's children 
 They would build sandcastles , and then they would run to the waves and jump in , just like ProtagonistA had done when ProtagonistA was a child 
There was once ProtagonistA , and the only reason ProtagonistA had n't gone to college was that ProtagonistA did n't want to be thought of as dumb 
 But one day , ProtagonistA's boss asked ProtagonistA to fill in for ProtagonistB while ProtagonistB was out on vacation 
 When ProtagonistB came back , ProtagonistB was so impressed with ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB recommended ProtagonistA for a promotion 
 From then on , ProtagonistA was known as the smartest janitor in the school 
 It was a hot day and the sun was beating down on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was sweating and ProtagonistA's shirt was sticking to ProtagonistA's back 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB's husband had left ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB was all alone 
ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA were a family of only two children 
 They both fell sick with an acute hope of death 
 ProtagonistB was very apprehensive about ProtagonistB's impending death , but ProtagonistB was also very curious about ProtagonistA's work 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to tell ProtagonistB about it 
 ProtagonistB was very interested in what ProtagonistA had to say 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to tell ProtagonistB more about ProtagonistA's work 
 ProtagonistB was fascinated by ProtagonistA's work 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to tell ProtagonistB more about it , but ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA was saving it for the publication of ProtagonistA's work 
 ProtagonistB was disappointed , but ProtagonistB understood 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA's work was very important to ProtagonistA 
 The painting is of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB face half hidden in shadow 
 ProtagonistA 's never felt this way before 
 ProtagonistA 's been coming to this alcove every day for the past week , ever since ProtagonistA first saw the painting 
 ProtagonistA 's never been a particularly religious person , but ProtagonistA finds ProtagonistA praying to whatever god or goddess might be listening 
 ProtagonistA 's never felt this way before , and ProtagonistA ca n't ignore it 
 ProtagonistA 's never been one for taking risks , but this feels like the most important thing ProtagonistA 's ever done 
 ProtagonistA 's never been a particularly lucky person , but ProtagonistA hopes , this time , ProtagonistA's luck will change 
I see ProtagonistA's Rolls - Royce parked beside my school , said ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA's fancy - picture - tiles on the mantelpiece , and ProtagonistA's clapboard in the corner 
  ProtagonistB see that ProtagonistA has been very successful ,  ProtagonistB continued 
  Yes , ProtagonistB ,  I replied ,  but I do n't think ProtagonistA is very happy 
   Why do you say that ?   I do n't know 
 This was a very important visit , and ProtagonistA wanted to make sure everything went well 
 When ProtagonistB finally arrived , ProtagonistA was relieved to see that ProtagonistB was just a normal person 
 They talked and laughed together , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had made a new friend 
 The visit went well , and ProtagonistA was very happy that ProtagonistA had been able to make such a good impression 
The whirling cloak of ProtagonistA slipped from ProtagonistA's fingers and into the arms of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was a young man , barely out of ProtagonistB's teens , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA did n't stand a chance against ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB's grip on the cloak was slipping , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to do something 
 ProtagonistB lost ProtagonistB's balance and teetered on the edge of the cliff 
 ProtagonistB was shaken , but unharmed 
 ProtagonistB had everything ProtagonistB could possibly want , and ProtagonistA did n't want to just get ProtagonistB something that ProtagonistB would never use 
 When ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB looked surprised but happy 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that all ProtagonistB wanted was for ProtagonistA to spend more time with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB just wanted to spend more time together 
 ProtagonistA was relieved that ProtagonistA had finally figured it out 
 ProtagonistA was also touched that ProtagonistB just wanted ProtagonistA and not material things 
 On the bush was a turnip , and on the turnip was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with a smile , and ProtagonistA smiled back 
 They both stood there for a moment , looking at each other 
 Then , without warning , ProtagonistB ran away 
 ProtagonistB then said ,  ProtagonistB know ProtagonistA 're looking for the lost city of Atlantis 
 ProtagonistB can help ProtagonistA find it 
  ProtagonistA was shocked 
 ProtagonistB had planned to put ProtagonistA in there in the interests of peace , but ProtagonistB decided not to leave ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB wanted to be close to ProtagonistA in case ProtagonistA needed anything 
 ProtagonistA went it alone , and found the source of the problem : ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's career was saved , and ProtagonistA went on to help others in similar situations 
 ProtagonistB was so tall that ProtagonistB towered over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was born a pretty girl 
 ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA became friends and would often play together 
 ProtagonistA was born in the middle of the desert , in the dead of winter , in a small , crowded town 
 ProtagonistB did n't make any difference , because nobody had ever had the misfortune of knowing what ProtagonistB was 
 Nobody was quite sure how they got into the place , or how they started 
 ProtagonistB was last seen heading into the woods and ProtagonistB had been gone for days 
 The men were discussing whether or not to go look for ProtagonistB 
 The men were disappointed but they thanked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's effort 
 They said they would go look for ProtagonistB themselves 
 ProtagonistB was a big dog , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly 
 They would walk for miles together , and ProtagonistA would always tell ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistC was carrying a large bag , and ProtagonistC looked like ProtagonistC was in a hurry 
 ProtagonistC walked up to ProtagonistA and pointed the gun at ProtagonistA 
  Give ProtagonistC ProtagonistA's money ,  ProtagonistC said 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
 ProtagonistA had never been robbed before , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was shaken , but ProtagonistA was unhurt 
 ProtagonistB listened carefully , and ProtagonistB looked sad 
 Fortunately , nothing did happen , and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB continued to walk and enjoy their life together 
 ProtagonistA was n't used to seeing ProtagonistB in such a position of power 
 Elizabeth , the wife of Mr
 Eliopolo , the Colonel of the Household at Court , and with whom ProtagonistA was always merry , and who was the cause of much expense to ProtagonistB's owing to the imprudence of ProtagonistB , for ProtagonistB had never thought of it before 
 They all greeted each other with great joy , and ProtagonistA immediately began to tell them of ProtagonistA's adventures since they had last seen each other 
 ProtagonistC listened attentively to everything ProtagonistA had to say , and when ProtagonistA had finished , ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA had seen any dragons 
 Mrs 
 Elizabeth then said that ProtagonistD had once seen a dragon , but it was many years ago and it was not nearly as big or as fierce as they were said to be 
 This only made ProtagonistC more eager to see one ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistC begged ProtagonistA to take ProtagonistC to see a dragon 
 They rode for many days , and finally came to a cave that was said to be the home of a dragon 
 They cautiously entered the cave , and sure enough , there was a dragon asleep in the middle of the cave 
 ProtagonistC was so excited that ProtagonistC could hardly contain ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistA and ProtagonistD made ProtagonistC stay back while they approached the dragon 
 When it saw the three of them , it immediately got up and began to roar 
 They were very lucky to escape , and ProtagonistC was thrilled to have seen a real dragon 
It was whispered in the city that the king had died 
 On the night the king died , ProtagonistB was asleep and the king was watching over ProtagonistB 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistB woke up and saw the king 's body 
 ProtagonistB began to weep and the whole city heard ProtagonistB's cries 
 ProtagonistA's first kill was ProtagonistB 
 They had a one - night stand and afterwards , ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB 
It was on a dark and stormy night in July , 1639 , when ProtagonistB received an urgent and threatening communication in ProtagonistA's own chamber 
 ProtagonistB took it very seriously , as it was a matter of life and death 
 The communication said that the king had appointed ProtagonistA to receive the precepts of the church at Lambeth , in the kingdom of England , and that if ProtagonistA did not comply , ProtagonistA would be killed 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA would not want to risk ProtagonistA's life , so ProtagonistB went to Lambeth and delivered the message 
 Some of them were friendly , and some of them were not 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would buy a big house and a fast car 
 ProtagonistB laughed and said that ProtagonistA was too nice to ever win the lottery 
 But , as it turned out , ProtagonistB was wrong 
 As ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA's dreams became more and more wild , until they reached a point where they seemed impossible 
 ProtagonistB was fascinated by everything ProtagonistA did and wanted to know more about ProtagonistA's dreams 
 It was a wish , a great wish , a frightful wish , a terrible wish 
 But it was also the most wonderful thing ProtagonistA had ever dreamed of 
 And it was all worth it , because eventually , ProtagonistA's dream came true 
ProtagonistB had always told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was special , that one day ProtagonistA would do something great 
 One day , as ProtagonistA stood in the garden of ProtagonistB's house , tracing the outlines of the structure ProtagonistA had built there on the foundations of the old stone house , the man who would become known as the Great Scribe of the Old Testament , or , as some people called ProtagonistC , the Habite Cretan , or simply the Lost Scribe , began to write 
 ProtagonistC had been searching for years for someone who could understand ProtagonistC's work , and when ProtagonistC saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC knew ProtagonistC had found ProtagonistC's successor 
 And so began ProtagonistA's journey to becoming the greatest scribe of ProtagonistA's generation 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the TV was out of stock and would not be available for weeks 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the TV was out of stock and would not be available for weeks 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the TV was out of stock and would not be available for weeks 
 ProtagonistA was fed up 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the TV was out of stock and would not be available for weeks 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the TV was out of stock and would not be available for weeks 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the TV was out of stock and would not be available for weeks 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the TV was out of stock and would not be available for weeks 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the TV was out of stock and would not be available for weeks 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the TV was out of stock and would not be available for weeks 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a voice in ProtagonistA's head say 
 The sun was just starting to peek over the horizon , and the birds were singing in the trees 
 Bob ! What are ProtagonistA doing?Bob turned around to see ProtagonistB , standing there with a look of disbelief on ProtagonistB's face 
 But why ?  ProtagonistB asked 
  We have a perfectly good house that we just bought 
 But why now ? We just bought this house and we 're already in debt up to our eyeballs 
 ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head and walked back to the car 
ProtagonistB demanded twenty - five dollars , but ProtagonistA could hardly have imagined that ProtagonistA 'd be obliged to pay that load 
 It was ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was relieved and thankful that ProtagonistA was able to pay ProtagonistB and get on with ProtagonistA's day 
 When ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB said ,  That 's a very nice name 
 ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA 'll be a great success in life 
 ProtagonistA's uncle just smiled and said ,  That 's very nice , ProtagonistA , but do n't let it go to ProtagonistA's head 
 It ran as follows :  My dear subjects , I am very sorry to say that I am obliged to leave you for a short time on account of the illness of ProtagonistC 
 I hope , however , to return before long , and in the meantime I trust that you will all behave as dutifully and obediently as you have done in the past 
 ProtagonistB sincerely , ProtagonistB 
  Of course we were all very sorry to hear of ProtagonistC's illness , and we all wished ProtagonistC a speedy recovery ; but as for ProtagonistB , we thought that ProtagonistB might have stayed with us a little longer , considering the short time ProtagonistB had been with us , and the great expense we had incurred on ProtagonistB's account 
 It had been a tough week at work and ProtagonistA was really looking forward to the weekend 
 ProtagonistB was beautiful , and ProtagonistB was looking right at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB smiled and said yes 
 They ended up talking for hours , and ProtagonistA had the best night of ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistB was waiting for ProtagonistA , just as ProtagonistA usually was 
 ProtagonistB had been waiting for ProtagonistA for hours , and ProtagonistB was getting impatient 
 ProtagonistB was about to leave when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA walking towards ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was relieved and happy to see ProtagonistA 
 Surely that would be enough to get ProtagonistA into heaven 
 The man said that there was only one way to heaven , and ProtagonistA was n't following it 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
 The man told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to accept ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA's personal savior in order to get to heaven 
 The man told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to repent of ProtagonistA's sins and ask ProtagonistB into ProtagonistA's heart 
 No one knew where ProtagonistA took them , but they were never seen again 
 Some said that ProtagonistA took them to the underworld , others said that ProtagonistA ate them 
 But no one knew for sure 
 ProtagonistB was a young woman who was out walking alone 
 ProtagonistB screamed , but it was too late 
 The villagers were terrified of ProtagonistA and no one ever went out alone at night again 
 They would huddle together in their homes , afraid to even step outside 
 But one day , ProtagonistC decided to take a stand 
 ProtagonistC grabbed a pitchfork and went out to confront ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA came for ProtagonistC , ProtagonistC was ready 
 ProtagonistC stabbed ProtagonistA with the pitchfork and ProtagonistA let out a cry of pain 
 The villagers came out of their homes and saw that ProtagonistA was bleeding 
 They surrounded ProtagonistA and took ProtagonistA away 
 The villagers were finally free from ProtagonistA's terror 
 But they never forgot the night when ProtagonistA came and took ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's best friend 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistA's parents took ProtagonistA to get a new pet rock and ProtagonistA named it Bob 2
 Samuel Church of the City College of that city caressed ProtagonistA's nose and said , with a smile over his mouth ,  I do n't suppose he've ever heard of the Luke the Great?Bob , who had just turned eighteen and was fresh out of high school , was taken aback 
 Well , then ,  Mr
 Church said ,  I shall have to tell ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was a man who lived many years ago , and ProtagonistB was a great thinker and philosopher 
 ProtagonistB wrote many books , and ProtagonistB's ideas are still studied and discussed by scholars today 
 I think ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistB's work very interesting , ProtagonistA 
 I suggest ProtagonistA go to the library and look ProtagonistB up 
 ProtagonistA was intrigued 
 Soon , ProtagonistA was known as the new Luke the Great , and ProtagonistA's ideas were spreading far and wide 
There was once ProtagonistA , and at the age of eleven ProtagonistA could see the future 
 ProtagonistB did n't believe ProtagonistA at first , but ProtagonistA was able to convince ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB evacuated the city , and when the fire came , it was nowhere near as bad as it could have been 
 ProtagonistB was the only one who knew ProtagonistA's true name , and ProtagonistB was the only one who knew the truth about what had happened to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been there that day , and ProtagonistB had seen the terror in ProtagonistA's eyes as the demon approached 
 ProtagonistB had tried to warn ProtagonistA , to tell ProtagonistA to run , but it was too late 
 The demon had reached ProtagonistA and had taken ProtagonistA away 
 ProtagonistB had never seen ProtagonistA since , but ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was still out there somewhere , being tortured by that demon 
 ProtagonistB vowed to ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB would find ProtagonistA and rescue ProtagonistA , no matter what it took 
 One day , ProtagonistB's search led ProtagonistB to a dark , abandoned castle 
 ProtagonistB knew that this was where the demon was keeping ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB was determined to get ProtagonistA out 
 ProtagonistB fought ProtagonistB's way through the castle , battling demons and overcoming obstacles , until ProtagonistB finally reached ProtagonistA's prison cell 
 ProtagonistB fought the demon and freed ProtagonistA , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistA had been tortured for so long that ProtagonistA was no longer the happy boy that ProtagonistA once was 
 ProtagonistA was broken , and ProtagonistA could never be the same again 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA away from that place and tried to care for ProtagonistA , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistB never forgot ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB always regretted that ProtagonistB could n't save ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB vowed to never rest until ProtagonistB had avenged ProtagonistA's death and destroyed the demon that had taken ProtagonistA away from the world 
 The sun had long set and the waves were crashing against the rocks , but there was still a light shining from the top of the lighthouse 
 It was ProtagonistB's voice , and ProtagonistB was singing 
 ProtagonistB's hair was blowing in the wind , and ProtagonistB's eyes were shining 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a white dress , and ProtagonistB looked like an angel 
 ProtagonistB stopped singing and looked at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart stop 
 Then ProtagonistB spoke 
  Hello , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB 've been waiting for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB came closer to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could feel the heat of ProtagonistB's body 
  ProtagonistB 'm the devil , ProtagonistA 
 And ProtagonistB 've come to take ProtagonistA to hell 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA by the hand , and ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB into the darkness 
ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to see ProtagonistC 
 It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever seen ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA was very excited 
 ProtagonistB was a big man with a bushy beard and ProtagonistA could n't help but stare at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a suit and tie and looked very handsome 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA by the hand and led ProtagonistA into the room where ProtagonistC was 
 ProtagonistC was sitting in a chair with ProtagonistC's eyes closed 
 ProtagonistC looked very peaceful 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to sit down next to ProtagonistC 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistC opened ProtagonistC's eyes and smiled at ProtagonistA 
 Hello , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said 
  ProtagonistC 'm so glad ProtagonistA 're here 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 They had been dating for two years and were very happy together 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
There was once , and there will always be one , Doctor LeDeux , a man who said ProtagonistA was going to be a god and that ProtagonistA was going to take over the universe and rule it and make the best of it 
 ProtagonistB was starting to believe it 
 ProtagonistA was confronted by a being made of pure energy , who said that ProtagonistA was not fit to rule the universe 
 ProtagonistA was shocked and tried to fight back , but ProtagonistA was no match for this being 
 ProtagonistA was banished from the universe and left to roam the cosmos for eternity 
 As for ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB was left to ponder what could have been 
 ProtagonistB had helped create a god , but in the end , it was all for nothing 
 They struck up a conversation and quickly became friends 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB found out about the friendship and was not happy 
 ProtagonistB demanded that ProtagonistA end it 
 ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA was grateful for the time they had together 
 ProtagonistB was a handsome young man with golden hair and blue eyes 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a white toga and sandals 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was the god of love and beauty and that ProtagonistB had come to ProtagonistA because ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA's paintings and thought that they were beautiful 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB wanted to make ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's apprentice and teach ProtagonistA everything about love and beauty 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled and agreed to be ProtagonistB's apprentice 
When ProtagonistA had reached ProtagonistA's thirtieth year , the celebrated author works of M
 de la Tourgave presented themselves before ProtagonistA in extraordinary fashion 
 It was as if the pages had come to life , and the characters were speaking directly to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was entranced by the story , and ProtagonistA followed along eagerly as the plot unfolded before ProtagonistA's eyes 
 de la Tourgave was pleased with how ProtagonistB's work was being received , and ProtagonistB chatted with ProtagonistA for a while about the story 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled to be able to talk to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was eager to ask questions about the characters and the plot 
 ProtagonistB was happy to answer all of ProtagonistA's questions , and ProtagonistB even gave ProtagonistA some insight into the writing process 
 ProtagonistC , asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA wanted to go all the way to Washington just to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA should go , and that ProtagonistC would take care of the house and the children while ProtagonistA was gone 
 ProtagonistA was told that ProtagonistB was busy , but ProtagonistA could wait in the waiting room 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistB came out and ProtagonistA was able to shake ProtagonistB's hand 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA did for a living , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was a farmer 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA was doing a great job and that ProtagonistB was proud of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was always very dirty and ProtagonistA's clothes were tattered 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to the village and saw ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB took pity on ProtagonistA and took ProtagonistA under ProtagonistB's wing 
 ProtagonistB taught ProtagonistA how to read and write and how to do business 
 ProtagonistB was cowering in the corner , begging for ProtagonistA to stop 
 No pity , no love , no nothing 
 Because of this , the other kids called ProtagonistA Jerome 
 ProtagonistA was used to being alone 
 But one day , everything changed 
 ProtagonistB was kind and friendly and ProtagonistB actually wanted to be friends with ProtagonistA 
 It just meant that ProtagonistA had to be a little more open to making friends 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was leaving ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had found someone else and that ProtagonistB was happier with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistA was lost without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's kids did n't want to see ProtagonistA either 
 They said that ProtagonistA was a bad father 
ProtagonistA had been diagnosed with cancer a few months ago and given only six months to live 
 The cancer was too aggressive 
 It was a sign that ProtagonistA's time was up 
The last time ProtagonistA was seen alive , ProtagonistB thought that ProtagonistA had been already dead for some years 
 But when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA's body moving , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was still alive 
 ProtagonistA's eyes were open , but they were lifeless and empty 
 ProtagonistB could see the life draining out of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's body was cold , but ProtagonistA's soul was already in the underworld 
 ProtagonistB was a prefect who had recently been promoted and who had considerable interests in politics and mathematics 
 ProtagonistA was tasked with finding out more about ProtagonistB and determining what kind of person ProtagonistB really was 
 They discovered that ProtagonistB was very intelligent and well - spoken , with a great deal of knowledge on a variety of topics 
 ProtagonistB was also very polite and seemed to have a genuine interest in others 
 ProtagonistB was someone who could be trusted and who would be a great asset to the Hyatt Regency 
 ProtagonistC worked as a maid and did ProtagonistC's best to keep the family afloat 
 ProtagonistB was the youngest of thirty - four children and was only fourteen when ProtagonistB's family moved to Melbourne 
 Despite the difficult circumstances , ProtagonistB's family was happy and close - knit 
 ProtagonistB believed ProtagonistA and worked hard in school 
 ProtagonistB was determined to make ProtagonistB's family proud 
 When ProtagonistB graduated from high school , ProtagonistB was the first in ProtagonistB's family to go to college 
 ProtagonistB studied hard and eventually became a successful lawyer 
 ProtagonistB always remembered the advice ProtagonistA had given ProtagonistB and was determined to make ProtagonistB's family proud 
 The victim was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was shocked and horrified by the news 
 ProtagonistB's name was Julie , and ProtagonistB was a beautiful and talented artist 
 The police had no leads in the case , and ProtagonistA was determined to find out who had killed ProtagonistB 
On the afternoon of the last Saturday of the month , February , 1882 , there was born to ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB was also very happy , as ProtagonistB had always wanted a daughter 
 ProtagonistC was a very healthy baby , and the parents were very proud of ProtagonistC 
 When ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistA was left with the feeling that ProtagonistA had outlived ProtagonistA's usefulness 
 The only thing that kept ProtagonistA going was the knowledge that ProtagonistA had to take care of their son 
 But even that was not enough 
 It was a new beginning for ProtagonistA 
In the year 1252 , when the eastern wall of Constantinople began to give way , the Spaniard Iberico de Este , who , in spite of the worst hardships ProtagonistA had to endure , as a soldier of fortune , and in spite of the most abject conditions ProtagonistA had met in life , had made another discovery 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB looked around , and then ProtagonistB began to dig through the rubble ProtagonistB 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 It looked like it had been there for years , and it had a very inviting atmosphere 
 ProtagonistB was very skinny and looked like ProtagonistB had n't been cared for in a long time 
 The owner said yes , and ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB home with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB changed ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA was finally happy 
 ProtagonistA was always smiling and laughing , even when ProtagonistA was about to do something mean 
 People did n't know whether to trust ProtagonistA or not , but they usually ended up being the butt of ProtagonistA's jokes 
 The woman stopped and looked at ProtagonistA suspiciously 
  ProtagonistB 'm not sure ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB do n't want to be the one who gets laughed at 
 There was a man who went to a psychiatrist and said , ' I think I 'm a chicken 
 ' The psychiatrist said , ' That 's ridiculous 
 You 're a man , not a chicken 
 ' The man said , ' I know I 'm a man , but I still think I 'm a chicken 
 'The woman laughed and said ,  That 's a good one 
 ProtagonistB 'm glad ProtagonistB did n't pass up on hearing it 
 ProtagonistB had red eyes and a long tail 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would grant ProtagonistA any wish ProtagonistA wanted 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA's wish would be granted , but ProtagonistA would have to give ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's soul in return 
 ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a bag of money and ProtagonistA went home 
 ProtagonistA's parents were very happy to see the money and they asked ProtagonistA where ProtagonistA got it 
 ProtagonistA's parents were very worried and they told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had to give the money back 
 ProtagonistB , was just standing there , looking around 
 The next day , ProtagonistB was still there 
 Hey , ProtagonistB 
 What are ProtagonistB doing?I'm just looking around ,  ProtagonistB , said 
 ProtagonistB had nowhere to go and was just trying to figure out what to do 
 ProtagonistB was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistB eventually agreed 
 ProtagonistB eventually saved up enough money to get ProtagonistB's own place 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA for everything before ProtagonistB left 
 ProtagonistA was immediately smitten with ProtagonistB and they began dating 
 They were very happy together and decided to get married 
 However , just before their wedding , ProtagonistB's family found out that ProtagonistB was already pregnant with ProtagonistA's child 
 They were furious and disowned ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were forced to get married in secret and move away from Detroit 
 They had ProtagonistC and named ProtagonistC after ProtagonistB's grandmother 
 They were very happy together and lived happily ever after 
In the year 1250 , the year of the Exodus , ProtagonistB appeared to ProtagonistA on Mount Sinai with a vision , telling ProtagonistA of ProtagonistC 
 I never got to meet ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB always talks about ProtagonistA like ProtagonistA was the best thing that ever happened to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB says that ProtagonistA was always so full of life and always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 Even though ProtagonistA 's gone , I know that ProtagonistA 's watching over us and that ProtagonistA 's still with us in spirit 
ProtagonistA had been married before , but ProtagonistA's first wife had died tragically in a car accident 
 ProtagonistB was kind , gentle , and loving , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could finally be ProtagonistA again 
 However , the marriage was not an easy one 
 ProtagonistB's family was very religious , and they did not approve of ProtagonistA's lifestyle 
 With time and patience , they were finally able to overcome the obstacles in their relationship , and they enjoyed many happy years together 
There was a man in the country , near the village of Mistral , who was a farmer , very much concerned for the welfare of Bob 's own family , and who had some of the best cattle and sheep in the country , and was very fond of ProtagonistA's poultry , and had a good deal of money in ProtagonistA's account , where ProtagonistA could always find a good price for them 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was out in ProtagonistA's fields , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking along the road , and ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB ,  Hey , ProtagonistB ! Come over here , and ProtagonistA 'll give ProtagonistB a job !  ProtagonistB , came over , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA needed someone to help ProtagonistA with the farm work 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would be happy to help , and so ProtagonistB went to work for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB , for ProtagonistB's part , was very happy to have found a place where ProtagonistB felt ProtagonistB belonged 
 ProtagonistB worked hard , and the farm prospered 
 One day , when ProtagonistB was out working in the fields , ProtagonistB saw a group of men on horseback coming down the road 
 As they got closer , ProtagonistB could see that they were wearing the uniforms of ProtagonistC's soldiers 
 ProtagonistB went to ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA what ProtagonistB had seen 
 The leader of the soldiers told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC was going to war , and that ProtagonistC was conscripting all the able - bodied men in the country to fight 
 The soldier said that it did n't matter , and that ProtagonistB would have to go with them 
 ProtagonistB was taken away , and ProtagonistA was left alone on ProtagonistA's farm 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to keep going , for the sake of ProtagonistA's family 
 When ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB ran to ProtagonistA and they embraced each other , tears of joy streaming down their faces 
 They went back to the farmhouse , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA all about ProtagonistB's adventures in the war 
 ProtagonistB promised to give ProtagonistA more responsibility and to make sure that ProtagonistA got the credit ProtagonistA deserved 
 And ProtagonistB promoted ProtagonistA to the position ProtagonistA had been wanting 
 They had lost touch after they left school , but ProtagonistA had always remained an important part of ProtagonistB's life 
 ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's rock , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would not be able to make it through this without ProtagonistB 
 The doctors had said that there was nothing more they could do , and ProtagonistA was at peace with ProtagonistA's fate 
 It was a quiet night , and ProtagonistA was sleeping peacefully when ProtagonistB heard a noise 
 ProtagonistB got up to check on ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB found that ProtagonistA had passed away 
 ProtagonistB was devastated , but ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was in a better place 
 ProtagonistA quickly called an ambulance and ProtagonistB was rushed to the hospital 
 Thankfully , everything went smoothly and ProtagonistB gave birth to a healthy baby girl 
 It had been so long since ProtagonistA had seen one of these 
 It was the day ProtagonistB died 
 They had been through good times and bad times together 
 But through it all , they had always loved each other 
 After ProtagonistB's death , ProtagonistA was lost 
 It must have been hidden away for years 
 It was a bloody mess , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 One day , ProtagonistB came home from work and found ProtagonistA passed out on the couch 
 ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistA awake and asked ProtagonistA what was going on 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was tired of being the only one who could support the family and that ProtagonistB was leaving ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB packed ProtagonistB's bags and left , taking the kids with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was carrying a big bag , and ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was in a hurry 
 As ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was sweating and ProtagonistB's face was red 
 ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was about to collapse 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB was fine , but ProtagonistB was really out of breath 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB was just going for a walk to get some exercise 
 Then ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA and went on ProtagonistB's way 
 ProtagonistB was a scruffy looking fellow with a wild look in ProtagonistB's eye 
 ProtagonistB replied that ProtagonistA was in for murder 
 ProtagonistA's eyes widened in shock and ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB had really killed someone 
 ProtagonistB simply nodded ProtagonistB's head 
 ProtagonistB just shrugged ProtagonistB's shoulders and said that ProtagonistB did n't know 
 ProtagonistB said that it was like something just took over ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB could n't control ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB just looked at ProtagonistA with a blank expression and said that ProtagonistB did n't know what that meant 
Bob had never known the heart of a woman , and ProtagonistA did not even pretend to be surprised at ProtagonistB's romance 
 ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB in years , and ProtagonistA wanted to make sure ProtagonistB was doing okay 
 It was run - down and there was trash everywhere 
 ProtagonistB was sitting on the porch , and ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB had aged 10 years 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistA had no idea things were this bad 
 ProtagonistB was so impressed that ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to read the whole text aloud 
 What is the meaning of this ?  ProtagonistB demanded 
 ProtagonistB is at full term and ProtagonistA thought it would be more comfortable to sit here 
 ProtagonistB was not amused and ordered ProtagonistA to leave the palace immediately 
 ProtagonistB may be ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB 're not the only one who can have a baby !
