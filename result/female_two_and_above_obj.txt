 ProtagonistA's ship was the best in the fleet , and ProtagonistA's crew was the envy of every other captain 
 except for one thing 
 Most men ProtagonistA met were either intimidated by ProtagonistA's success or turned off by ProtagonistA's no - nonsense attitude 
 ProtagonistB was a captain like ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB understood ProtagonistA's need for a challenge 
 ProtagonistB was also strong and handsome , with a kind heart 
 They married a year later , and ProtagonistA was finally happy 
 It was the best day of ProtagonistA's life 
 In fact , ProtagonistB was proud of ProtagonistA for finally standing up for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was born an orphan in and of ProtagonistA's father 's house on the river Seine ; ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistA's father 's sister , who was kind to ProtagonistA , but always treated ProtagonistA as if ProtagonistA were a second - class citizen 
 When ProtagonistA was sixteen , ProtagonistA's aunt died and ProtagonistA was left completely alone in the world 
 ProtagonistB's name was Pierre and ProtagonistB was kind and gentle and ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA away from the life of prostitution and helped ProtagonistA to start anew 
 They started talking to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA soon found out that they were all in high school 
 The woman was surrounded by dark shadows , and ProtagonistA could feel a great sense of evil emanating from them 
 ProtagonistA was suddenly snapped out of ProtagonistA's vision by a noise downstairs 
 They chatted for a while , and ProtagonistA learned that ProtagonistB's name was John 
 ProtagonistB was in town for a conference , and ProtagonistB was also a writer 
 They exchanged information , and ProtagonistA invited ProtagonistB to come to ProtagonistA's house for dinner 
 ProtagonistB accepted , and they parted ways 
 They talked and laughed long into the night , and ProtagonistA felt as if ProtagonistA had known ProtagonistB forever 
 ProtagonistB was asleep , and ProtagonistA hoped that ProtagonistB would soon wake and be ProtagonistB again 
 It was so beautiful , and ProtagonistA knew that it was a sign from ProtagonistB 
  Thank ProtagonistB for everything 
 ProtagonistB was different than any other man ProtagonistA had ever met 
 ProtagonistB was kind , gentle and ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA laugh 
 And then one day , out of the blue , ProtagonistB proposed 
 ProtagonistA's friends had all been so excited for ProtagonistA , and had given ProtagonistA a list of things ProtagonistA needed to do to prepare , but after ProtagonistA had done all of those things , ProtagonistA still felt like something was missing 
 Was this how it was supposed to feel ? ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistB come in until ProtagonistB was right next to ProtagonistA 
 Hey , what 's up ?  ProtagonistB asked , kissing ProtagonistA on the forehead 
 About what?About what it 's going to be like after the baby comes 
 ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA and took ProtagonistA's hand 
  ProtagonistB do n't know , but ProtagonistB 'm excited to find out 
This is a story about a man who must be kept from knowing , because it would kill ProtagonistA , that ProtagonistC , could be alive and always be looking for ProtagonistA 
 But there ProtagonistC was , standing in front of ProtagonistA , looking as if ProtagonistC had never left 
 ProtagonistA was frozen in place , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
 ProtagonistC took a step towards ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA stepped back 
 ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said , ProtagonistC's voice soft and gentle 
  It 's been a long time 
  ProtagonistC killed ProtagonistB and then ProtagonistC just left 
 ProtagonistC did n't even try to find ProtagonistA 
 I'm sorry ,  ProtagonistC said 
  ProtagonistC did n't mean to kill ProtagonistB 
 It was an accident 
  ProtagonistC did n't mean to kill ProtagonistB ? ProtagonistC shot ProtagonistB in the head!Alice , please ,  ProtagonistC said , reaching out to touch ProtagonistA's arm 
  Just stay away from ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistC was back and ProtagonistC was looking for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB would always tell ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was too good for this world and that ProtagonistA would end up getting hurt 
 ProtagonistB finally told ProtagonistA the truth : ProtagonistB had been hurt so badly in ProtagonistB's life that ProtagonistB had decided to never let ProtagonistB feel that pain again 
 ProtagonistB did n't want ProtagonistA to end up like ProtagonistB did , so ProtagonistB pushed ProtagonistA away 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken , but ProtagonistA understood 
 ProtagonistA was always surrounded by admirers , but ProtagonistA only had eyes for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was the love of ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA cherished every moment they spent together 
 They traveled the world , went on adventures , and just enjoyed each other 's company 
 They were truly the perfect couple 
 Everyone who knew them was jealous of their relationship 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 In it was ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was waving at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as the owner of the house ProtagonistA was renting , and said ProtagonistB was just in the area and thought ProtagonistB 'd drop by and say hello 
 They chatted for a while , and then ProtagonistB left 
It was Christmas time in the year of our Lord 1662 and ProtagonistA was sitting down at the first coffee - table conversation of ProtagonistA's life 
 But now that ProtagonistA was married , ProtagonistA's husband had insisted that they spend the holiday season with his family in London 
 ProtagonistB smiles and strikes up a conversation , asking ProtagonistA about ProtagonistA's life back in the village 
It was a quiet April afternoon , and perfectly to the good taste of the artist , who wanted to make a work out of his own life , that ProtagonistA passed through the doors of the Gallery of the Imperial Palace , and took up ProtagonistA's residence in a double - room with a balcony , and ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA in hand 
 The first thing ProtagonistB did was to set ProtagonistA to work on a still- life of a bowl of fruit , which ProtagonistB had bought for the purpose , and which ProtagonistA executed with great skill and feeling 
 After that ProtagonistB began to teach ProtagonistA to paint in oils , and ProtagonistA soon showed a remarkable talent for it 
ProtagonistA's parents had always been poor , but they had never been unhappy 
 They were content with their lot in life and grateful for what they had 
 However , when the war came , everything changed 
 ProtagonistA's father was drafted into the army and ProtagonistB was left to fend for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA 
 The sun rose slowly , but in the midst of all the misery of the city , which was then , and for a long time afterwards , a fine and flourishing town , there rose a little meek , innocent - looking girl of about sixteen or seventeen years of age , who seemed to have been driven into a very inconvenient position during the war ; and for the most part it was the fault of ProtagonistA's parents , who were not at all happy , poor , or otherwise about ProtagonistA , in the least 
 ProtagonistB was tall and thin , with dark hair and an unkempt beard 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a dirty , ragged coat , and ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB had n't slept in days 
 When ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB smiled , revealing a mouth full of yellowed teeth 
 ProtagonistB grabbed it and ran off the train before ProtagonistA could stop ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was shaken , but ProtagonistA was also angry 
 ProtagonistA had been taught to help others , but something about ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA hesitate 
 ProtagonistB had a wild look in ProtagonistB's eye and ProtagonistA did n't want to get too close 
  Please help ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB 'm so tired and ProtagonistB ca n't make it on ProtagonistB's own 
There was once ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's age was sixteen 
 ProtagonistB was very tall and had a long beard 
 ProtagonistB was also carrying a large bag 
 When ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistA's friend screamed and ran away 
 ProtagonistB chased after ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA managed to lose ProtagonistB 
 They called the police and ProtagonistB was arrested 
 The sun had long since stopped shining , and the only light came from the moon 
 ProtagonistA had been sold into slavery , and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistA's family again 
 The only thing that kept ProtagonistA going was the hope that one day ProtagonistA would be free 
 Should ProtagonistA try to help him?Should ProtagonistA stay silent?She decided to stay silent , and ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB disappeared into the darkness 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB need to talk to ProtagonistA about something ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistA's father passed away 
  ProtagonistB 'm so sorry , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said as ProtagonistB pulled ProtagonistA into a hug 
  We will get through this together 
 ProtagonistA was exhausted and just wanted to go to bed 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB was doing there and ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB was there to kill ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB then slit ProtagonistA's throat 
 It was perhaps this that made ProtagonistA so attractive to ProtagonistB 
 Liddell was a young man , not much older than ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB had a kind face and a gentle manner 
 ProtagonistB took a liking to ProtagonistA at once , and they soon became friends 
 ProtagonistB would talk to ProtagonistA about all sorts of things , and ProtagonistA would listen eagerly , hanging on ProtagonistB's every word 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to see ProtagonistC to ask for ProtagonistA's hand in marriage 
 ProtagonistC was shocked , and ProtagonistC forbade the match 
 ProtagonistB was heartbroken , but ProtagonistB respected ProtagonistC's wishes and left 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistA moped around the house , barely eating or speaking , until ProtagonistC took pity on ProtagonistA and relented 
 ProtagonistC gave ProtagonistC's blessing to the match , and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were married shortly thereafter 
 ProtagonistA was relieved and grateful , and ProtagonistA soon fell asleep in ProtagonistB's arms 
 ProtagonistB would always tell ProtagonistA to go outside and play , and ProtagonistA would be gone for hours 
 One day , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to the park to watch the kids play 
 They said yes , and off they went 
 But then , one of the girls said something that made ProtagonistA stop in ProtagonistA's tracks 
 You're not very good at this , are ProtagonistA 's face fell 
 ProtagonistB could see the hurt look on ProtagonistA's face , and ProtagonistB decided it was time to go 
 As they walked home , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what was wrong 
 Do n't let anyone tell ProtagonistA otherwise 
 ProtagonistB was only 19 at the time , and ProtagonistA's death left ProtagonistB with a small fortune of a few thousand pounds 
 With no other family to rely on , ProtagonistB was forced to fend for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was able to find a job as a governess , but it was a far cry from the life of luxury ProtagonistB had been used to 
 Even so , ProtagonistB was determined to make the best of ProtagonistB's situation 
 ProtagonistB continued to live ProtagonistB's life with grace and dignity , despite the hardships ProtagonistB faced 
ProtagonistB had known ProtagonistA for years , ever since they were kids 
 ProtagonistB had never forgotten how ProtagonistA had always been there for ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was determined to return the favor 
 So , when ProtagonistA was diagnosed with cancer , ProtagonistB made it ProtagonistB's mission to support ProtagonistA through everything 
 ProtagonistB went to all of ProtagonistA's doctor 's appointments with ProtagonistA , helped ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's homework when ProtagonistA was too tired to do it ProtagonistA , and just tried to be there for ProtagonistA as much as possible 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was fighting a tough battle , but ProtagonistB never gave up hope 
 ProtagonistB was devastated , but ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was now in a better place 
ProtagonistA was borne in the City of London , between eight and ten o'clock , on Tuesday , the twenty - first day of June , 1688 
 ProtagonistA was born to the Island of Dunk , in the Sound of the Sea , where ProtagonistA remained until the arrival of ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was a kind and just ruler , and ProtagonistC welcomed ProtagonistA to ProtagonistC's kingdom with open arms 
 It was a shock to see ProtagonistB dressed in men 's clothes , with a short haircut and a beard 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was doing well , and that ProtagonistB had recently started hormone therapy and was beginning to transition 
 They parted ways , and ProtagonistA promised to keep in touch 
 It was a cold , winter day and ProtagonistB had been in the hospital for weeks 
 The doctors said there was nothing they could do 
 ProtagonistB was dying 
 The thought of ProtagonistA's own death scared ProtagonistA , but it also made ProtagonistA appreciate life more 
 ProtagonistB was crying and looked very upset 
 The man comforted ProtagonistB and then they both walked away 
 ProtagonistA was relieved that ProtagonistA had helped , even though ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
To ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's brother , Mr
 Joseph Duryea , of the tower : It was a cold , winter day when ProtagonistB met ProtagonistB's untimely end 
 ProtagonistB was out on the sea , doing what ProtagonistB loved , when a storm suddenly appeared out of nowhere 
 ProtagonistB's ship was tossed about like a toy in the waves and eventually capsized 
 ProtagonistB was thrown into the frigid water and drowned before ProtagonistB's crew could even reach ProtagonistB 
 When news of ProtagonistB's death reached ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistA was left to raise their two young children , ProtagonistC and ProtagonistD , on ProtagonistA's own 
 They were always short on money and food 
 It was a small space , but it was better than nothing 
 Susan and Jethro were always asking about ProtagonistB and what ProtagonistB was like 
 It was a difficult conversation , but ProtagonistA knew it was the right thing to do 
 Susan and Jethro were quiet for a long time after ProtagonistA had finished speaking 
 But then ProtagonistC said ,  Thank ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA , for telling us the truth 
 We love ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistD nodded in agreement 
 ProtagonistA was relieved that ProtagonistA had finally been able to tell ProtagonistA's children the truth about ProtagonistB 
 It was a weight off ProtagonistA's shoulders 
ProtagonistA was lying upon the ground , ProtagonistA's arms stretched out in front of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's legs crossed , ProtagonistA's head resting on the side of ProtagonistA's hands 
 It was like ProtagonistA's own little slice of heaven 
ProtagonistA's friends called ProtagonistA's squire , but ProtagonistA would not cast a glance aside , for ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistB was the perfect man for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA would not trade ProtagonistB for anything in the world 
 After all , they could never find a man who was as perfect as ProtagonistB 
We had just left ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's anchor in the water , when ProtagonistB , in a singular instance , which must have occurred to most of the passengers , jumped into the sea 
 The captain , who was on the bridge at the time , saw ProtagonistB go overboard and immediately rang the alarm 
 ProtagonistB was quickly pulled out of the water by one of the crew and brought back on board , where ProtagonistB was given a warm blanket and a cup of hot tea 
 The captain asked ProtagonistB what had happened , but ProtagonistB could only mutter a few incoherent words before passing out from exhaustion 
 ProtagonistB was excited to see ProtagonistA and ran to ProtagonistA with open arms 
 ProtagonistA was happy to finally be reunited with ProtagonistB and they spent the day catching up on all that had happened in the past year 
 ProtagonistB 'll be ProtagonistB's companion 
 ProtagonistC stood in the doorway , looking at ProtagonistA with a quizzical expression 
  Can ProtagonistC help ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistC asked 
  ProtagonistA 'm looking for ProtagonistB 
 Do ProtagonistC know where ProtagonistA can find ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistC thought for a moment and then ProtagonistC said ,  ProtagonistC think ProtagonistB might be in the forest 
 ProtagonistB would find ProtagonistA in the strangest places , like the time ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA in the attic or the time ProtagonistA was sleepwalking in the middle of the night and ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA in the kitchen 
 But this time was different 
 This time , ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA in the midst of a crowd of people who were gathered below the palace 
 ProtagonistB was relieved to find ProtagonistA and took ProtagonistA's home , but ProtagonistB could n't help but worry about what could have happened if ProtagonistB had n't found ProtagonistA 
It was within a few miles of the bridge at which the ship was anchored , and on the second of April of that year , ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's seventeenth year , died of cholera , having been left behind at the head of the ship by a man who wished to save ProtagonistA's life , and by whom ProtagonistA had been left destitute 
 When they arrived at their destination , ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA on the ship , telling ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would come back for ProtagonistA 
 However , ProtagonistB never returned and ProtagonistA was left alone 
 The ship was anchored near a bridge and ProtagonistA could see the people on the other side , but ProtagonistA was unable to reach them 
 ProtagonistA's death was a tragedy 
 ProtagonistA had been left alone and destitute by ProtagonistB 
One morning in October , 1890 , ProtagonistA came to the friend - house in the street called Beechmere Lane , with the sign over ProtagonistA's door :  No visitors 
 No exceptions 
 They had been friends for many years , and ProtagonistA was sad to see ProtagonistB go 
 They hugged each other tightly , and said their goodbyes 
 However , ProtagonistB had passed out by the time evening came , and ProtagonistA was left alone in the house 
 They were laughing and having a great time , but when they saw ProtagonistA they immediately stopped what they were doing and ran away 
 ProtagonistA was very hurt by this and ProtagonistA could n't understand why the children would be afraid of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the children were probably just afraid of strangers and that ProtagonistA should n't take it personally 
 ProtagonistA was relieved to hear this and ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's advice 
 The children started to look up to ProtagonistA and they admired ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's kind and caring nature 
 They would often tell their parents how lucky they were to have ProtagonistA as their neighbour 
ProtagonistA's aunt glared at ProtagonistA with a face that looked like it was on fire 
  ProtagonistA , I will not tolerate ProtagonistA's insolence any longer 
 ProtagonistA turned and walked to ProtagonistA's room , ProtagonistA's head held high 
 It felt like ProtagonistA was trapped in a nightmare with no way out 
 ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA onto the bird 's back and they flew away 
 ProtagonistB , however , just smiled and nodded encouragingly 
 This time , ProtagonistA's words came out more confidently 
 ProtagonistB nodded and smiled throughout ProtagonistA's speech 
 When ProtagonistA finished , ProtagonistB clapped ProtagonistB's hands and congratulated ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA had a bright future ahead of ProtagonistA and that ProtagonistA would be a great writer 
 The room was full of light , and the colors were so bright that they almost hurt ProtagonistA's eyes 
 There were people in the room , too , and they were all so beautiful that ProtagonistA could n't help but stare 
 Finally , ProtagonistB , came over to ProtagonistA and asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was doing there 
 ProtagonistB was sitting on a throne , wearing a crown and a long , flowing gown 
 ProtagonistB had a stern look on ProtagonistB's face , but ProtagonistB's eyes were kind 
 Who are ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 I'm Alice ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 This is ProtagonistB's castle ,  ProtagonistB said 
 You must leave ,  ProtagonistB said 
  What 's wrong?There are dangerous creatures in these halls ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistA 's been there for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had a heart attack 
 ProtagonistB visits ProtagonistA every day , but today ProtagonistB 's not here 
  Hello , ProtagonistA 
 The woman is glowing and has a kind smile 
 I'm ProtagonistA's guardian angel ,  the woman replies 
  I 've been watching over ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's family for a long time 
 Of course ProtagonistA do , everyone does ,  the woman says 
  I 'm here to help ProtagonistA through this difficult time 
 ProtagonistB was a bit of a player and ProtagonistB immediately started hitting on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB did n't take no for an answer though , and ProtagonistB kept trying to convince ProtagonistA to sleep with ProtagonistB 
 Unfortunately , ProtagonistC did find out and ProtagonistC was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistC ended things with ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was left feeling regretful and alone 
 They started chatting and soon realized that they had a lot in common 
 They arranged to meet in person and they hit it off immediately 
It was a beautiful good day in October when ProtagonistA trod into the garden and saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was sitting on a bench , reading a book 
 ProtagonistB looked up when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA and smiled 
 Hello , ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 'm so glad ProtagonistB 're here 
 What about ?  ProtagonistB asked , closing ProtagonistB's book 
  ProtagonistA know ProtagonistA 've been distant lately and ProtagonistA 'm sorry 
 It 's okay , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said , getting up from the bench and giving ProtagonistA a hug 
  ProtagonistB understand 
 ProtagonistB 'm here for ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA need to talk 
 It was good to have ProtagonistB's support 
 The only thing that ProtagonistA has to keep ProtagonistA's company is the moon 
 The moon is ProtagonistA's friend 
 ProtagonistA talks to it every night 
 The moon is the only one who knows ProtagonistA 
 One night , ProtagonistA's parents go out to dinner and leave ProtagonistA's home alone 
  Hello , moon 
 ProtagonistA 'm so happy to see you tonight 
 ProtagonistB's name is Sarah 
 ProtagonistB 's in ProtagonistA's class at school 
 ProtagonistA really like ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA talks to it for hours 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA's parents come home 
 They see ProtagonistA sitting in the backyard , talking to the moon 
 They smile and shake their heads 
 They know that ProtagonistA is a special girl 
 They know that ProtagonistA is nothing without the moon 
In the year 1853 , the week under which ProtagonistA was born , ProtagonistB was induced to put a lock of ProtagonistA's hair on ProtagonistA's head 
 While ProtagonistC but little doubted that ProtagonistB was well acted , yet ProtagonistB found ProtagonistB plainly and unmistakably perceived to be interested in the matter , which , however , ProtagonistB had never before encountered in ProtagonistB's life , and which ProtagonistB had never dreamed of any way , before that time , having , in fact , no conception of the end or purpose of the conduct of ProtagonistB's affairs , been deceived into believing that they were spent , or that they were in proper hands 
 ProtagonistB had always been a dutiful sister , and when ProtagonistA was born ProtagonistB was happy to do anything that was asked of ProtagonistB 
 So when ProtagonistB was asked to put a lock of ProtagonistA's hair on ProtagonistA's head , ProtagonistB did n't hesitate 
 But as ProtagonistB did so , ProtagonistB realized that this was the first time ProtagonistB had ever been asked to do anything like this 
 ProtagonistB began to wonder what the purpose of it was 
 Was it just a harmless tradition , or was there something more to ProtagonistB could n't help but be interested in the matter , and ProtagonistB started to pay more attention to ProtagonistC's conduct 
 ProtagonistB began to suspect that there was more to it than meets the eye 
 As ProtagonistB continued to watch and learn , ProtagonistB gradually realized that ProtagonistC was not the person ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistC was 
 In fact , ProtagonistC was a fraud 
 ProtagonistB was shocked and horrified 
 ProtagonistB had been deceived into believing that ProtagonistC was a good and honest person , but ProtagonistC was actually a dishonest and manipulative woman 
 ProtagonistB was determined to expose ProtagonistC's true nature to the world 
 ProtagonistB went to the media and told them everything ProtagonistB knew 
 The story made headlines , and ProtagonistC was soon exposed as a fraud 
 ProtagonistB felt vindicated 
 ProtagonistB had been deceived , but ProtagonistB had also been brave enough to stand up and tell the truth 
 ProtagonistB had made a difference 
At the turn of the last century , when Europe was drifting apart , there lived ProtagonistA , and by the name of Caroline Caroline , or Caroline of Mary , ProtagonistA was called 
 ProtagonistA's father was a doctor and ProtagonistA's mother was a housewife 
 ProtagonistB was married and living in London 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistA to ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was an artist , and ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA quickly became friends 
 They would spend hours walking around London , talking and laughing 
 One day , ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA to marry ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistA said yes 
 They were married a few months later , and ProtagonistA moved into ProtagonistC's apartment 
 However , ProtagonistA's happiness was short - lived 
 ProtagonistC was a very jealous man , and ProtagonistC began to control ProtagonistA's every move 
 ProtagonistC did n't want ProtagonistA to leave the apartment , and ProtagonistC did n't want ProtagonistA to talk to anyone but ProtagonistC 
 However , the only reason ProtagonistA had never gone to college was that ProtagonistA did n't want to be thought of as dumb 
 One day , ProtagonistB , came to ProtagonistA with some news 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm going to college !  ProtagonistB exclaimed 
 That 's great ,  ProtagonistA said , trying to sound enthusiastic 
 Why did n't ProtagonistA ever go ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA sympathetically 
 ProtagonistA 're one of the smartest people ProtagonistB know 
 ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA would 've done great in college 
 ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistB's words 
There is no such thing as ProtagonistA , but there is a pricetag which is often a price - tag of the costume which ProtagonistA wears 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA is transported to a magical place 
 ProtagonistA's parents are very angry with ProtagonistA and they tell ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA must never leave the house again 
 ProtagonistA read about a girl who lived in a different world , a world where there were no rules and ProtagonistB could do whatever ProtagonistB wanted 
 ProtagonistB was always happy and carefree , and ProtagonistA wanted to be just like ProtagonistB 
 The light had changed for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was never going to go back to the way things were before 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 It led ProtagonistA to the back door 
 ProtagonistB was sitting in the middle of a big field 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB was lost 
 After a while , they came to a road 
 ProtagonistB pointed to a house down the road and said that was ProtagonistB's home 
 ProtagonistC came to the door and ProtagonistC was ProtagonistB's mother 
 ProtagonistC was so happy to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC thanked ProtagonistA for bringing ProtagonistB's home 
 The painting is of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB's face hidden in the shadows 
 ProtagonistB is crying , ProtagonistB's tears falling into the darkness 
I see ProtagonistA's Rolls - Royce parked beside my school , said ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA's fancy - picture - tiles on the mantelpiece , and ProtagonistA's clapboard in the corner 
 ProtagonistB then went on to say that ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA at a party last weekend , and ProtagonistA looked happy and healthy 
 They were kind , intelligent and well - spoken 
 ProtagonistA felt very at ease with them and they soon became friends 
 ProtagonistB was especially friendly and ProtagonistA felt very drawn to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA's facial features , ProtagonistA's eye color , and ProtagonistA's body , said ProtagonistB , are all different 
 ProtagonistB was always pointing out how unique ProtagonistA was , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB for it 
 It was unlike any ProtagonistA had ever seen before 
 It had ProtagonistB's eyes 
 As soon as ProtagonistA did , the butterfly flew away 
 ProtagonistB had already bested ProtagonistA several times , but ProtagonistA was determined to win this time 
 The henchman grabbed ProtagonistA's cloak , causing ProtagonistA to lose ProtagonistA's grip on ProtagonistA's sword 
 ProtagonistB took advantage of the situation and knocked ProtagonistA to the ground 
 ProtagonistB was about to deliver the final blow when ProtagonistA's cloak suddenly came to life and wrapped itself around ProtagonistB's neck , choking ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB's henchman tried to pull the cloak off of ProtagonistB , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistB was already dead 
 With ProtagonistB gone , ProtagonistA's cloak released its grip and fell into the arms of the victor 
 ProtagonistB had followed ProtagonistA for days , waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike 
 When ProtagonistA finally stopped for gas , ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistB's chance 
 ProtagonistB slipped into the passenger seat of ProtagonistA's car and forced ProtagonistA to drive to a remote location 
 There , ProtagonistB raped ProtagonistA 
 Afterwards , ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA there to fend for ProtagonistA 
 I met ProtagonistB 
 I knew that ProtagonistB was the one for me 
 I proposed to ProtagonistB , and we were married 
 I am happy with ProtagonistB , and I know that ProtagonistA was wrong about me 
 ProtagonistB said it was for ProtagonistA 
 It even had the same type of paper in it 
 The words flowed easily and the story came together perfectly 
 ProtagonistA was finished in no time 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was doing in the turnip bush and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA was looking for ProtagonistA's lost cat 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA's cat earlier and offered to help ProtagonistA find it 
 They searched through the bush together , but they could n't find the cat 
 ProtagonistB carried ProtagonistA through the bush until they found ProtagonistA's cat 
 ProtagonistA 's never been one for following the crowd or conforming to societal norms 
 ProtagonistB is a free spirit , just like ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB 's always up for a adventure and is always pushing boundaries 
 ProtagonistA 's finally found someone who accepts ProtagonistA for who ProtagonistA is and loves ProtagonistA for it 
 On their wedding day , ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA 's finally become the woman ProtagonistA 's always wanted to be 
 ProtagonistA had been told that there was a place beyond the trees where the ground was made of something called  grass 
 In the center of the clearing was a large tree , and around the tree was a ring of smaller trees 
 It sounded like someone was coming 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA and smiled 
  Hi ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB's name is Sarah 
 What 's ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA forgot to answer 
 It 's okay ,  ProtagonistB said 
  There 's nothing to be afraid of 
 ProtagonistB wo n't hurt ProtagonistA 
 It 's nice to meet ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB know where that is ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Follow ProtagonistB 
 After a while , they came to a place where the trees stopped and the ground was covered in grass 
 This is it ,  ProtagonistB said 
  This is the place where the trees stop 
  This is the most beautiful place ProtagonistA 've ever seen 
In the beginning was a star , the same star which , in the beginning , ProtagonistA made , the shell of which ProtagonistA fashioned into four parts , the golden - headed , ProtagonistB , the bright - eyed , the yellow - eyed , and the red - eyed 
 All of these were beautiful , but the golden - headed was the most beautiful of all 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was out , the golden - headed went to ProtagonistB and said ,  I am the most beautiful of all 
 ProtagonistB should worship me 
  ProtagonistB replied ,  No , ProtagonistB am the most beautiful of all 
 You should worship ProtagonistB 
  This went on for some time , until the golden - headed got angry and said ,  If ProtagonistB do not worship me , I will kill ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB did not worship the golden - headed , so the golden - headed killed ProtagonistB 
 The same thing happened to the bright - eyed , the yellow - eyed , and the red - eyed 
 In the end , only the golden - headed remained 
 When ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's symptoms , ProtagonistB did a few tests and then sat ProtagonistA down to give ProtagonistA the news 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA needed to make some lifestyle changes and take medication for the rest of ProtagonistA's life 
I once had a story of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's parents were very proud of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was always the center of attention 
 The first thing ProtagonistA saw was a large caterpillar smoking a pipe 
 ProtagonistA's parents were very happy to see ProtagonistA , and they asked ProtagonistA to tell them all about ProtagonistA's adventure 
 ProtagonistA's parents were amazed , and they told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was a very special girl 
 They said that ProtagonistA could do anything ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to 
 It was a bestseller , and everyone loved it 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a dress that was too big for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's hair was cut short 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB's name was ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to follow ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA did 
 They fell in love and got married 
 They lived happily ever after 
 ProtagonistB was a big dog , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly 
 They would walk for hours together , and ProtagonistA would always make sure to bring ProtagonistB home safe and sound 
 ProtagonistB immediately ran to ProtagonistA's side , and stayed with ProtagonistA until help arrived 
 The river was flowing swiftly and the water looked deep 
 But ProtagonistB did n't seem to hear ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB kept playing 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistB lost ProtagonistB's balance and fell into the river 
 It was a cold winter evening and ProtagonistA had just returned from a long day of work 
  Hello ?  said a voice on the other end 
  Is this the Smith residence ?  asked ProtagonistA 
  Yes , it is ,  said the voice 
  May ProtagonistA speak to ProtagonistB , please ?  asked ProtagonistA 
  I 'm sorry , but ProtagonistB is not available at the moment ,  said the voice 
  Can I take a message ?   Yes , please ,  said ProtagonistA 
  Could you tell ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA called and ProtagonistA is very sorry for the inconvenience , but ProtagonistA will call back tomorrow ?   I will certainly tell ProtagonistB ,  said the voice 
  Thank ProtagonistA for calling 
 Elizabeth , the wife of Mr
 Eliopolo , the Colonel of the Household at Court , and with whom ProtagonistA was always merry , and who was the cause of much expense to Carol 's owing to the imprudence of ProtagonistA , for ProtagonistA had never thought of it before 
 They all greeted ProtagonistA warmly , and ProtagonistA was happy to be in their midst once more 
 They chatted and laughed together , enjoying the fine day , until suddenly they heard a loud noise 
 They turned to see a large herd of stampeding horses coming towards them , kicking up a cloud of dust 
 ProtagonistA's father shouted for everyone to get to safety , but it was too late 
 The horses were upon them in an instant , trampling them underfoot 
 ProtagonistA was thrown from ProtagonistA's horse and hit ProtagonistA's head on a rock 
 The last thing ProtagonistA heard was ProtagonistB screaming for help 
It was whispered in the city that ProtagonistA would tell you how it came to pass 
 ProtagonistB had a knife in ProtagonistB's hand and ProtagonistA was terrified 
 ProtagonistA was so shaken up that ProtagonistA decided to move to a different city 
 And that 's how ProtagonistA came to pass 
On a dark and stormy night in July , 1639 , the servant of the lord Bishop of York , who had been appointed by ProtagonistB to receive the precepts of the church , at Lambeth , in the kingdom of England , received an urgent and threatening communication in ProtagonistA's own chamber , which ProtagonistA took very seriously 
 It was from the hand of ProtagonistB , and it commanded ProtagonistA to appear before ProtagonistB at Lambeth Palace the next morning 
 ProtagonistA was met there by ProtagonistB's guard and taken to the royal presence 
 ProtagonistB was angry and demanded to know why ProtagonistA had not obeyed ProtagonistB's summons 
 ProtagonistB then ordered ProtagonistA to be taken to the Tower of London and imprisoned there 
ProtagonistA can remember the last time ProtagonistA had sex like it was yesterday 
 They were fooling around and things got a little too heated 
 ProtagonistA was n't ready to have sex and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB no , but ProtagonistB did n't listen 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA by force and ProtagonistA will never forget it 
 All men , of whatever sex , must die , but ProtagonistA will always remember the last time ProtagonistA had sex 
 It was the worst experience of ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA's office was a small , well - furnished , and hot - air - conditioned room 
 The dozen men who turned into it were immediately struck by the heat 
 The men were all well - dressed , and they all looked to be in good health 
 The men all looked at each other , and then ProtagonistB spoke up 
 We're here to ask ProtagonistA for a favor , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  You see , we 're all in a bit of a predicament 
 It seems that they were all in need of money 
 They had all been frequenting the same ladies ' houses the summer before , and they had all run into a bit of bad luck 
 Now , they were all in need of a loan 
 The men were all very grateful , and they thanked ProtagonistA profusely 
 As they were leaving , one of the men turned to ProtagonistA and asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA had agreed to help them 
 The men all nodded their heads in agreement , and then they left 
ProtagonistA was born nine months after ProtagonistA's parents got married 
 ProtagonistB was thrilled to be a dad and doted on ProtagonistA every chance ProtagonistB got 
 ProtagonistC , was happy to have a child to raise , but ProtagonistC was also worried about how ProtagonistB would take care of ProtagonistA 
 After all , ProtagonistB was always working and did n't have much time for ProtagonistA 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was five years old , ProtagonistB came home from work and found ProtagonistC in the kitchen , crying 
 When ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistC what was wrong , ProtagonistC told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistC had been cheating on ProtagonistB and that ProtagonistA was n't ProtagonistB's daughter 
 ProtagonistB was devastated 
 ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA like ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's own , but now ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistA wasn't 
 ProtagonistB did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistB could n't tell ProtagonistC that ProtagonistB knew the truth , but ProtagonistB also could n't continue to pretend like everything was normal 
 In the end , ProtagonistB decided to move out and start a new life without ProtagonistA 
 It was the hardest thing ProtagonistB ever had to do , but ProtagonistB knew it was for the best 
 ProtagonistB caught up to ProtagonistA and grabbed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB dragged ProtagonistA into an alley and raped ProtagonistA 
 Afterwards , ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA there to die 
 ProtagonistB did n't care about ProtagonistA's past or ProtagonistA's fears 
 ProtagonistB only cared about ProtagonistA's present and ProtagonistA's future 
 They were married and had a beautiful life together 
 It was ProtagonistA's favorite place to play as a child 
 ProtagonistB told the story of the house , how it was built by ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC wanted to build ProtagonistD a house that would befit ProtagonistD's station , so ProtagonistC had the best architects and masons in the land build ProtagonistD a stone house 
 ProtagonistB told how ProtagonistD fell in love with a commoner , and how ProtagonistC was so enraged that ProtagonistC had the man killed 
 ProtagonistD was so heartbroken that ProtagonistD took ProtagonistD's own life 
 ProtagonistC was so distraught that ProtagonistC had the house torn down , and it was never rebuilt 
 ProtagonistB told how , centuries later , ProtagonistE had found the old foundation and decided to build a new house on it 
 ProtagonistE had no idea of the history of the house , but ProtagonistA now knew 
 ProtagonistB was supposed to help ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's purchase , but instead , ProtagonistB drove ProtagonistA into the blackness of ProtagonistA's apartment 
 It was exhausting , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 ProtagonistB sniffed and wiped ProtagonistB's eyes before ProtagonistB started to speak 
  ProtagonistC are getting a divorce ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistC is moving away , and ProtagonistB 'm going to have to go with ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB do n't want to leave ProtagonistB's mom 
 ProtagonistB eventually stopped crying , and ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA talked for a while longer 
 ProtagonistB felt better knowing ProtagonistB was n't alone 
 ProtagonistA was reminded that even though ProtagonistA's own life was tough , there were others who were going through worse 
 ProtagonistB had been a sailor for as long as ProtagonistB could remember , and the sea had always been ProtagonistB's home 
 But now , as ProtagonistB looked at the world above the waves , ProtagonistB felt like a stranger 
 ProtagonistB was n't sure who ProtagonistB was anymore , or what ProtagonistB's place in the world was 
 Was ProtagonistB still a sailor ? Or was ProtagonistB something more ? ProtagonistB was n't sure , but ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB had to find out 
 ProtagonistB demanded twenty - five dollars from ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA could hardly have imagined that ProtagonistA 'd be obliged to pay that load 
 ProtagonistB walked away , leaving ProtagonistA standing there , feeling angry and frustrated 
 The country was in the midst of a civil war , and ProtagonistA's home state of Virginia was on the side of the Confederacy 
 It was an afternoon of some utility , but it was also an afternoon of worry and distraction for ProtagonistA 
One morning , after the close of our first term , when the pain on my hand was beginning to subside , ProtagonistA issued a paper which ProtagonistA supposed to be a communication from ProtagonistB , for it bore the stamp of ProtagonistB's office , and was filled with the seal of the State 
 It ran as follows:The King of Hearts desires the pleasure of ProtagonistA's company at a Court Ball to be given this evening in honor of the visiting Princess of Hearts 
 They were both pleased , and ProtagonistA's father said ProtagonistA might go if ProtagonistA liked , but ProtagonistA must be back by midnight 
 ProtagonistA was ready long before the time , and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's parents set out for the palace in good spirits 
 On their arrival they were ushered into a magnificent hall , where the King and Queen and the Princess were already seated 
 ProtagonistB was very gracious to ProtagonistA , and asked ProtagonistA to dance with ProtagonistB ; and ProtagonistA did so , feeling quite proud and happy 
 At last the clocks struck twelve , and ProtagonistA was free to go 
 On one hand , ProtagonistB had just given ProtagonistA a raise and a promotion 
 On the other hand , ProtagonistA's best friend had just been diagnosed with cancer 
 ProtagonistA was so caught up in ProtagonistA's thoughts that ProtagonistA did n't hear ProtagonistB come up to ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA okay ?  ProtagonistB asked , concern etched on ProtagonistB's face 
  ProtagonistA 'm just happy and sad at the same time 
 But today , ProtagonistB was late 
  ProtagonistB 'm so sorry ,  ProtagonistB panted 
  ProtagonistB got held up at work 
 ProtagonistB was helpless , and ProtagonistA knew it 
ProtagonistB had ProtagonistA , and when ProtagonistA was five years old ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a name 
 ProtagonistB named ProtagonistA after ProtagonistB's mother , who had died when ProtagonistA was just a baby 
 ProtagonistB caressed ProtagonistA's nose and said , with a smile over ProtagonistB's mouth ,  ProtagonistB do n't suppose ProtagonistA 's ever heard of the Luke the ProtagonistA was taken aback 
 ProtagonistA 'm a big fan 
 Church was pleased 
  ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA might be ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm a big fan of ProtagonistC ProtagonistB 
 In fact , ProtagonistB 'm writing a book about ProtagonistC 
 I'll make sure ProtagonistA get a copy ,  ProtagonistB said 
 And so began a beautiful friendship between ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB 
 They would spend hours talking about ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistA even helped ProtagonistB with ProtagonistB's book 
 It was published to great acclaim , and ProtagonistA was proud to have played a part in it 
 It was said that ProtagonistB had the power to control the weather and that ProtagonistB could make it rain or snow whenever ProtagonistB wanted 
 Some people even claimed that ProtagonistB could make the sun rise or set just by thinking about it 
 ProtagonistB had been sent to protect ProtagonistA from the demon that was trying to kill ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was supposed to use ProtagonistB's powers to help ProtagonistA defeat the demon and send it back to the underworld 
 After the battle was over , ProtagonistB had to return to ProtagonistB's own world 
ProtagonistB was the last man ProtagonistA saw before ProtagonistA left the East India ocean 
 ProtagonistB was a forgotten white - bearded beauty , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistC's day was coming 
 ProtagonistB did n't believe ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB did n't want to take any chances 
 ProtagonistB stayed up all night , watching the waves and waiting for ProtagonistC to come 
 But ProtagonistC never came 
 ProtagonistB was relieved , but ProtagonistB was also a little disappointed 
 ProtagonistB had never seen ProtagonistC before , and ProtagonistB was curious to know what ProtagonistC looked like 
ProtagonistA's godfather took ProtagonistA to see Mummy , ProtagonistB's sweetheart , ProtagonistB's sister , Mummy 
 It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever met ProtagonistA's extended family and ProtagonistA was excited to finally put faces to the names ProtagonistA had heard so much about 
 ProtagonistB was kind and loving , ProtagonistB's sweetheart was funny and charming , and ProtagonistB's sister was just like ProtagonistB in every way 
There was once , and there will always be one , Doctor LeDeux , a man who said ProtagonistA was going to be a god and that ProtagonistA was going to take over the universe and rule it and make the best of it 
 ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA , even when ProtagonistA did n't believe in ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB believed in ProtagonistA when no one else did 
 ProtagonistB saw this in ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB nurtured it 
 ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA to develop ProtagonistA's powers and to learn how to use them 
 ProtagonistA was destined to rule the universe 
 ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA , even when ProtagonistA did n't believe in ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB believed in ProtagonistA when no one else did 
 ProtagonistB's name was John , and ProtagonistB was a cruel and heartless ruler 
 The people of the kingdom were terrified of ProtagonistB , and they did everything ProtagonistB said 
 One day , ProtagonistB decided ProtagonistB wanted to marry ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was very happy , and ProtagonistB had a grand wedding 
 After the wedding , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB's bedchamber and raped ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB just kept going until ProtagonistB was finished 
 ProtagonistA was traumatized by the experience , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never be able to forget it 
 ProtagonistA was always impeccably dressed in the latest fashions and carried ProtagonistA with the air of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's features were sharp and angular , ProtagonistA's eyes piercing and cold 
 ProtagonistA was adopted 
 ProtagonistA's real parents had been killed in a car accident when ProtagonistA was just a baby 
 They had wanted ProtagonistA to have a better life than they had , and so they had given ProtagonistA everything they could 
 ProtagonistB was very handsome and had a kind heart 
 The two of them hit it off immediately and began to talk 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life and how ProtagonistB was the son of ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB also told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's love for nature and the outdoors 
 The two of them talked for hours , until finally , it was time for ProtagonistA to wake up 
 But one day ProtagonistB came to the village , and ProtagonistB had a name , and ProtagonistB was well known to nobody 
  And ProtagonistB said ,  That is a pity , for if ProtagonistA had a name ProtagonistA would be as well known as ProtagonistB am , and everybody would know ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA would be a good , honest boy in everything 
  And then ProtagonistB went away , and ProtagonistA was left in the village with no name 
When ProtagonistA had reached ProtagonistA's thirtieth year , the celebrated author works of M
 de la Tourgave presented themselves before ProtagonistA in extraordinary fashion 
 It was at a dinner party given by one of ProtagonistA's friends that ProtagonistA finally had the chance to speak with ProtagonistB 
 They struck up a conversation and discovered that they had a lot in common 
 Eventually , they began dating and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA falling in love with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC , was a successful businessman , and ProtagonistA's mother , Martha , was a well - known socialite 
 ProtagonistC was very surprised when ProtagonistA told ProtagonistC ProtagonistA's plans 
 ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA wanted to go to Washington 
 ProtagonistC was not sure that it was a good idea for ProtagonistA to go to Washington 
 ProtagonistC was worried about ProtagonistA's safety 
 ProtagonistC finally agreed to let ProtagonistA go to Washington 
 ProtagonistC gave ProtagonistA some money for ProtagonistA's expenses 
 They were very proud of ProtagonistA 
 It is said that ProtagonistA had grown up to be a very rich man , although ProtagonistA could not certainly prove it 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to the village and asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA could help ProtagonistB find a lost dog 
 ProtagonistB was so grateful that ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a large bag of gold 
 Everyone in the village was very happy , and they all lived happily ever after 
 ProtagonistB was so fast that ProtagonistA could not catch ProtagonistB 
 The door was labeled  Do Not Enter 
  But ProtagonistA , being the curious girl that ProtagonistA was , ignored the warning and entered the door 
 The colors were so bright and the creatures were so strange 
 It was ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistB was telling ProtagonistA to come back , but ProtagonistA was having too much fun exploring 
 ProtagonistB warned ProtagonistA that if ProtagonistA did n't come back , ProtagonistA would be stuck in this place forever 
 And so , ProtagonistB left ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA is now stuck in that place , forever exploring and never able to leave 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB seemed to be in a hurry and ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA to a large door 
 ProtagonistB disappeared and ProtagonistA was left alone 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA it was time to go home 
ProtagonistA was raised in a missionary family and was taught to help those in need 
 ProtagonistB was so grateful and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had been blessed with a special gift 
 The power to control death 
 As long as ProtagonistA had this power , the angel of death would have no control over ProtagonistA 
 That 's why ProtagonistA had to keep it a secret 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB could help ProtagonistA use it for good 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could trust ProtagonistB 
 Together , they began to use ProtagonistA's power to help others 
 To save lives 
 And as long as ProtagonistA had this power , the angel of death would have no power over ProtagonistA 
 They hit it off immediately and started dating 
 ProtagonistB was the first man ProtagonistA had ever met who made ProtagonistA feel truly happy 
 They got married a year later and lived happily ever after 
 The centurion said to ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA are a beautiful woman 
 I can tell that ProtagonistA are a kind and caring person 
 I am going to take ProtagonistA back to my camp so that ProtagonistA can be my queen 
 One day , the centurion said to ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA , I must go to battle 
 I will leave ProtagonistA here in my camp 
 I will leave ProtagonistB to watch over ProtagonistA 
 The centurion left and ProtagonistB took care of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was very kind to ProtagonistA and they soon fell in love 
 ProtagonistB was a young woman , who had been stabbed to death in ProtagonistB's own home 
 ProtagonistA was shocked by the news and decided to find out more about the case 
 ProtagonistA was horrified by the story and decided to help the police with their investigation 
 It was said to be the most beautiful thing in the world , and ProtagonistA knew that it was true 
 It was even more beautiful than ProtagonistA had imagined 
 It 's beautiful , is n't ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB standing next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was also admiring the pyramid 
 They stood there together for a while , just looking at the pyramid 
 Then ProtagonistB spoke again 
 I'm sorry , ProtagonistB did n't mean to disturb ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB just wanted to share the moment with someone 
  ProtagonistA 'm glad ProtagonistB did 
 They stood there together for a while longer , enjoying the view 
 Then they went their separate ways 
 It was an unforgettable experience 
On the afternoon of the last Saturday of the month , February , 1882 , there was born to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was born at home in the front parlor , with the midwife in attendance 
 ProtagonistB was present for the birth of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB was filled with pride and joy at the sight of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was loved by ProtagonistA's family and friends , and ProtagonistA will be deeply missed by all who knew ProtagonistA 
In the year 1252 , when the eastern wall of Constantinople began to give way , the Spaniard Iberico de Este , who , in spite of the worst hardships ProtagonistA had to endure , as a soldier of fortune , and in spite of the most abject conditions ProtagonistA had met in life , had made another discovery 
 ProtagonistB had found the secret entrance to the city 
 ProtagonistA had been reduced to living as a beggar in Constantinople , until ProtagonistB had taken ProtagonistA under ProtagonistB's wing 
 When ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about the secret entrance , ProtagonistA was thrilled 
 They made their way to the wall and ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA the hidden door 
 They slipped inside and began to make their way through the city , avoiding the guards 
 Eventually , they made it to the palace , where they found ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was being held captive by the Moors , and ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA were able to rescue ProtagonistC 
 From then on , ProtagonistA would be known as the Moor Slayer 
 ProtagonistB was not paying attention to ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's opportunity 
 ProtagonistC is dirty and ProtagonistB 're not paying attention to ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB 're a disgrace 
  ProtagonistB was taken aback and started to apologize , but ProtagonistA was n't done 
  Hello , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 've been watching ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB know that ProtagonistA 're a special girl 
 ProtagonistB 'm here to offer ProtagonistA a deal 
  If ProtagonistA give ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's soul , ProtagonistB will make all of ProtagonistA's dreams come true 
  ProtagonistB made it sound so tempting , but ProtagonistA knew better 
  ProtagonistB was angry , but ProtagonistB knew there was nothing ProtagonistB could do 
 ProtagonistA was surrounded by ProtagonistA's friends and they were all having a great time 
 However , the fun came to a halt when ProtagonistB went into the room where ProtagonistA was having ProtagonistA's feast 
 Son of a whore ,  said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistB went into the very room where ProtagonistA had the feast 
 It hit ProtagonistB in the head and ProtagonistB fell to the ground 
 ProtagonistA's friends were horrified , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistB's name was Lloyd Lorenge and ProtagonistB looked to be no older than thirteen 
 ProtagonistB was standing in between ProtagonistA and the old building in which ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's office 
 ProtagonistB was looking down at the ground , as if ProtagonistB were lost in thought 
 ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with tears in ProtagonistB's eyes and said that ProtagonistB was lost 
 ProtagonistB's parents had died in a car accident and ProtagonistB was all alone in the world 
 ProtagonistA always wondered what happened to ProtagonistB and if ProtagonistB was doing okay 
First came the rumor that ProtagonistA had hired a team of assassins to kill the father of one of ProtagonistA's cousins 
 This caused quite a stir in the family , and everyone was on edge 
 Then , ProtagonistB , came forward and said that ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA arranging for a single assassin to do the work 
 This was the final straw , and ProtagonistA was immediately arrested 
 The court of coroner ruled that ProtagonistA was guilty of first degree murder , and ProtagonistA was sentenced to life in prison 
A hundred years ago , in the year 1873 , ProtagonistB happened to meet ProtagonistA in the city of Detroit 
 They would often walk around the city together , exploring all the different shops and businesses 
 One day , while they were walking , they came across a beautiful dress in a shop window 
 After much pleading , ProtagonistB finally gave in and bought the dress for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was able to take the dress back to the store and exchange it for a smaller size 
 The girls continued to be friends for many years , until ProtagonistB moved away 
 They kept in touch through letters , and ProtagonistA always cherished the dress that ProtagonistB had bought for ProtagonistA 
In the year 1250 , the year of the Exodus , ProtagonistB appeared to ProtagonistA on Mount Sinai with a vision , telling ProtagonistA of ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistC would bring ProtagonistC's people to a new land , where they would be free from the tyranny of the Pharaohs 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to tell ProtagonistA's people to be ready , and to follow ProtagonistC when ProtagonistC came 
 ProtagonistB was a good man , but ProtagonistB came from a poor family and did n't have much to offer ProtagonistA in terms of a future 
 ProtagonistA's family did everything they could to dissuade ProtagonistA from marrying ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was determined 
 The first few years were tough , as ProtagonistA's family continued to disapprove of ProtagonistA's choice and ProtagonistB struggled to find work that could support them 
 But they persevered and eventually found happiness together 
 They had two beautiful children and a life that , while not always easy , was filled with love 
There was a man in the country , near the village of Mistral , who was a farmer , very much concerned for the welfare of ProtagonistA's own family , and who had some of the best cattle and sheep in the country , and was very fond of ProtagonistA's poultry , and had a good deal of money in ProtagonistA's account , where ProtagonistA could always find a good price for them 
 One day , however , ProtagonistB found that ProtagonistB's cattle and sheep had all died , and ProtagonistB's poultry had all been stolen 
 ProtagonistB was very much distressed at this , and went to the village to ask ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA knew anything about it 
 ProtagonistB was surprised , but ProtagonistB listened to ProtagonistA and promised to start giving ProtagonistA's project the attention it deserved 
 They had been living together for over a year , and ProtagonistA was fed up with ProtagonistC's messy habits 
 ProtagonistC was apologetic and promised to do better 
 They listened , and while they did n't necessarily agree with everything ProtagonistA said , they did start to treat ProtagonistA with more respect 
 It was the day ProtagonistA finally had the courage to speak ProtagonistA's mind , and it was the best day of ProtagonistA's life 
You 're going see ProtagonistA 
 There 's ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB 's got just as much money , and ProtagonistB 's got just as many guns , and ProtagonistB 's got just as many bombs 
 And ProtagonistB 's not afraid to use them 
 Sooner or later , there 's going to be a big showdown between the two of them , and it 's going to be a bloody one 
 It was a hot October day , and ProtagonistA was sweating in ProtagonistA's thick wool dress 
 ProtagonistB was tall and thin , with dark hair and piercing blue eyes 
 Could it be love ? 
 And then ProtagonistA was gone , leaving ProtagonistB alone in the water 
 ProtagonistB did n't know where ProtagonistA had gone , or why ProtagonistA had left 
 ProtagonistB missed ProtagonistA terribly , and ProtagonistB wondered if ProtagonistB would ever see ProtagonistA again 
 ProtagonistA's eyes were different , and ProtagonistA's hair was shorter 
 But despite all of these changes , ProtagonistB was still happy to see ProtagonistA 
 They hugged each other tightly , and they caught up on all that had happened in the years that they had been apart 
 ProtagonistB was amazed at all the stories that ProtagonistA had to tell , and ProtagonistB was happy that ProtagonistA had finally come back to ProtagonistB 
 And ProtagonistB was glad to have ProtagonistA back in ProtagonistB's life 
 In the end , their beautiful baby girl was born healthy and happy 
 ProtagonistB was so struck by ProtagonistA's beauty that ProtagonistB immediately asked ProtagonistA to marry ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA joyfully accepted 
One afternoon , in the spring of an American year , when the sun filled and the clouds were blue , ProtagonistB hobbled ProtagonistA up the river , and pulled ProtagonistA out of the splashing rose - trees 
 ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA for some time , and had been struck by ProtagonistA's beauty 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA of ProtagonistB's life on the sea , and of the places ProtagonistB had seen 
 ProtagonistA was captivated by ProtagonistB's stories , and before long , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA agreeing to go with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to a small inn by the river , and they spent the afternoon talking and drinking wine 
 As the sun began to set , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to stay with ProtagonistB 
It was a cold , wet , snow - packed February day in the last year of the reign of Henry III 
 , when ProtagonistA died of a fever that , for many years afterward , caused even the most shocked Christians to reckon ProtagonistA blessed 
 Though ProtagonistA was only seventeen , ProtagonistA had been married for two years , and ProtagonistB was already talking of starting a family 
 But ProtagonistA's death put a stop to those plans 
 For days after ProtagonistA's funeral , ProtagonistB could be seen wandering the streets of their small town , aimlessly kicking at the snow and muttering to ProtagonistB 
 Some said ProtagonistB went mad with grief ; others said ProtagonistB was simply cursed by God 
 But whatever the reason , ProtagonistB never recovered from ProtagonistA's death , and ProtagonistB died less than a year later 
ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by stories 
 ProtagonistB , had a way of making even the most mundane events sound like the most exciting adventure 
 ProtagonistB could make you believe that anything was possible , and that the world was a good place full of possibilities 
 ProtagonistA was captivated by ProtagonistB's stories , and ProtagonistA began to see the world in a new light 
 People were drawn to ProtagonistA's stories , and ProtagonistA quickly became known as a master storyteller in ProtagonistA's own right 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was missing something 
 The rabbit led ProtagonistA to a hole and ProtagonistA fell down it 
 The rabbit led ProtagonistA to a castle and ProtagonistA went inside 
 ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was looking for 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA would never find what ProtagonistA was looking for if ProtagonistA did n't know what it was 
 They both sat in silence for a while , until ProtagonistB finally spoke up 
 What did ProtagonistA do ?  ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB nodded 
  ProtagonistB was at the park with ProtagonistB's friends when the police came and arrested us 
 They said we were causing a disturbance , but we were n't doing anything 
 As the sun began to rise , they both knew that they were going to have to face whatever was happening to them 
 It was , after all , something that ProtagonistA had always suspected 
 ProtagonistB was a kind and loving woman , but there was something about ProtagonistB that just seemed to cry out for romance 
 And now , it seemed , ProtagonistB had found it 
 ProtagonistB eyed ProtagonistA with a look of amusement 
  ProtagonistA are not what ProtagonistB expected ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB expected someone more 
 regal 
  And ProtagonistA 'm not here to impress ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 'm here to get something done 
  ProtagonistB leaned back in ProtagonistB's chair and regarded ProtagonistA for a moment 
  It 's a simple trade agreement 
 Nothing more , nothing less 
  ProtagonistB looked at the document , then back at ProtagonistA 
  It saves time 
  ProtagonistB signed the document , then pushed it back across the table to ProtagonistA 
  There ProtagonistA go ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB stared at ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA walked away , then shook ProtagonistB's head and went back to ProtagonistB's lunch 
 ProtagonistA did n't understand why ProtagonistB had to go and why ProtagonistB could n't take ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB 
 The first winter was the hardest 
 One day , ProtagonistC sat ProtagonistA down and explained that ProtagonistB was doing important work and that ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA very much 
 ProtagonistC also said that ProtagonistB would be back soon 
 said ProtagonistA , turning ProtagonistA's chair around to face the floor 
 It was ProtagonistA's own little space where ProtagonistA could be alone and think and read and write 
 It was perfect 
 But one day , everything changed 
 ProtagonistA's parents got a divorce , and ProtagonistA had to move in with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was always there , always making noise , always bothering ProtagonistA 
 It was torture 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had been praying for ProtagonistA , and that ProtagonistB believed ProtagonistA's innocence 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would do everything ProtagonistB could to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB's help was not enough , and ProtagonistA was executed 
 But ProtagonistB had led ProtagonistA deeper and deeper into the forest , until ProtagonistA was completely lost 
 ProtagonistB beckoned ProtagonistA to follow ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA out of the forest and back to ProtagonistA's home 
 ProtagonistA was jolted awake by the sound of the barn door opening 
 There was no answer 
 ProtagonistA's heart was pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
 ProtagonistA was terrified 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was relieved 
 It was ProtagonistB 
  What are ProtagonistB doing here?I came to check on ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA go into the cooler , and ProtagonistB was worried about ProtagonistA 
  Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA 'm fine 
 Okay ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'll let ProtagonistA get back to ProtagonistA's nap then 
 ProtagonistB said yes , so ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistB was amazed and said they were the most beautiful feet ProtagonistB had ever seen 
 ProtagonistA was shocked and hurt 
 When ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistB denied it at first 
 But eventually ProtagonistB confessed 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB was sorry and that ProtagonistB did n't know why ProtagonistB did it 
 It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining down on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approach 
 ProtagonistA ?  a voice said 
 I was just wondering what ProtagonistA were thinking about ,  ProtagonistB said 
  It 's so beautiful out here 
 Yes , it is ,  ProtagonistB said , coming to sit beside ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB 'm glad ProtagonistA 're enjoying it 
 They sat there together , enjoying the peace and quiet of the day 
 ProtagonistB came into the room and stared at ProtagonistA , a cruel smile on ProtagonistB's face 
  ProtagonistB see ProtagonistA 're still here ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm sorry to say that ProtagonistA's rescue is not coming 
 No one knows ProtagonistA 're here , and no one ever will 
 ProtagonistB came closer to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA backed away until ProtagonistA was against the wall 
 ProtagonistB grabbed ProtagonistA by the throat and started to choke ProtagonistA 
It was that rainy morning in July , that ProtagonistA was watching over ProtagonistA's new house 
 ProtagonistB came up to the house and knocked on the door 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB was moving into the house next door , and ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA moving in and wanted to welcome ProtagonistA to the neighborhood 
 They talked for a while , and ProtagonistA invited ProtagonistB in for some coffee 
 They became friends , and ProtagonistA was glad to have a neighbor ProtagonistA could talk to 
 Tonight was no different 
 Maybe the moon was just taking a break 
 But it was gone 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was inside ProtagonistA's house 
  ProtagonistB 've come for the moon ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB know ProtagonistA have it 
 Give it to ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistA was confused 
 But before ProtagonistA could say anything , ProtagonistB had pulled out a gun and pointed it at ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB do n't want to hurt ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Just give ProtagonistB the moon 
 It was the sound of someone moving around 
 ProtagonistB heard it too 
 ProtagonistB turned and ran out of the house 
 Snuggles , sleeping on ProtagonistA's bed 
ProtagonistB was a beautiful mare , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly 
 However , one day , while they were out grazing in the pasture , ProtagonistB suddenly began to spin in circles , ProtagonistB's eyes wide in alarm 
 ProtagonistB's hooves shook in the darkness , and ProtagonistA knew something was wrong 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB collapsed , and ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB was dead 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 It was a day that changed ProtagonistA's life forever 
 ProtagonistB stammered and said ,  ProtagonistA look 
 different 
 At the end of the date , ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB had a great time , but ProtagonistB think ProtagonistB 'm going to need some time to get used to ProtagonistA's new look 
 The drink was a bright pink and tasted like strawberries 
 It was ProtagonistA's new favorite and ProtagonistA loved it 
 ProtagonistB stopped and looked at ProtagonistA 
 Are ProtagonistA feeling alright ?  ProtagonistB asked 
  ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head and said ,  ProtagonistA should lay off the alcohol 
 It 's not good for ProtagonistA 
  And with that , ProtagonistB walked away 
For as long as ProtagonistA could remember , ProtagonistB had been the only person ProtagonistA knew who had ever understood ProtagonistA's whole personality better 
 Even when ProtagonistA was a little girl and would get upset about something , ProtagonistB would always know how to make ProtagonistA feel better 
 ProtagonistB was the one person ProtagonistA could always count on , no matter what 
 So when ProtagonistB passed away suddenly , ProtagonistA was absolutely devastated 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to get through it 
 They became friends and started dating 
 They got married a few years later and had two kids 
 They were happy together until ProtagonistB died of a heart attack 
 ProtagonistA was left to raise their kids on ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA was too keyed up to sit still 
 The door opened and ProtagonistB walked in 
 ProtagonistB was just as ProtagonistA remembered ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a simple dress and ProtagonistB's hair was pulled back in a loose ponytail 
 ProtagonistB looked tired , but ProtagonistB's eyes lit up when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA 
 Rainbow Dash ! ProtagonistB ca n't believe ProtagonistA 're here !  ProtagonistB exclaimed 
 What 's wrong ?  ProtagonistB asked , concern creasing ProtagonistB's brow 
 It 's ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC 's in trouble and ProtagonistA do n't know how to help ProtagonistC 
 Of course , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB 'll do whatever ProtagonistB can 
 ProtagonistB sat down and listened as ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistC's problems 
 ProtagonistA was relieved when ProtagonistB offered to help 
 Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB 
 It 's no problem , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB 'm happy to help 
 Now , let 's see what we can do for ProtagonistC 
 The second thing ProtagonistA noticed was the car idling next to ProtagonistB with the driver 's side door open 
 ProtagonistB , surprised at first , followed suit 
 They sped off into the night , not knowing where they were going or what they were doing , but knowing that they had to get as far away from that church as possible 
 It had been years since they had last seen each other and ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistB would even remember ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB and they ran to each other and hugged 
 They both started crying and they promised to never lose touch again 
 That changed when ProtagonistA was attacked one night while walking home from work 
 ProtagonistB came out of the shadows and grabbed ProtagonistA , holding a knife to ProtagonistA's throat 
 ProtagonistA was terrified 
 But then , something inside ProtagonistA snapped 
 ProtagonistB fell to the ground , clutching ProtagonistB's wound and groaning in pain 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB had a package for ProtagonistA 
 They were ProtagonistA's favorite 
  Is this ProtagonistA ?  the voice on the other end said 
  I 'm sorry to tell you this , but ProtagonistB was in a car accident 
 ProtagonistB did n't make it 
 This was ProtagonistA's worst nightmare come true 
  Hello there ,  the voice said 
  It looks like ProtagonistA 're having some trouble 
  ProtagonistB wo n't move 
 Let ProtagonistC take a look ,  ProtagonistC said 
 ProtagonistC walked over and placed ProtagonistC's hand on ProtagonistB's head 
 After a few moments , ProtagonistB started moving again 
 There ProtagonistA go ,  ProtagonistC said 
  Just give ProtagonistB a little encouragement and ProtagonistB 'll be fine 
Once upon a time , there was a land called Twilight 
 It was a magical place where ProtagonistA lived and laughed ProtagonistA's butt off 
 ProtagonistB was so handsome and charming that ProtagonistA fell in love with ProtagonistB instantly 
 They got married and had a beautiful baby girl 
 They lived happily ever after 
 ProtagonistB was a kind and honest person , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could always count on ProtagonistB to tell the truth 
 ProtagonistB was the most beautiful horse ProtagonistA had ever seen , with a long , flowing mane and tail and a coat that shone in the sun 
 ProtagonistA was determined to buy ProtagonistB , no matter what the cost 
 The opportunity finally came one day when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB in the field behind ProtagonistA's house 
 ProtagonistB seemed startled at first , but ProtagonistA quickly won ProtagonistB over with a few kind words and a treat 
 In the end , ProtagonistB agreed and ProtagonistA rode off with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistB had been out fishing all day , and ProtagonistA had been eagerly awaiting ProtagonistB's return 
 But when the doorbell rang , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistB had just drowned 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 It was a cold night , and ProtagonistB's moon was particularly bright 
 But ProtagonistB was too quick 
 ProtagonistB dodged the net and flew off into the night , leaving ProtagonistA empty - handed 
 Now , the sun was setting and ProtagonistA was starting to get scared 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB had been looking for ProtagonistA too 
 They were both relieved and happy to be reunited 
 They walked back to the river to find the others and continued playing until it was time to go home 
 ProtagonistB was very beautiful , with long blonde hair and blue eyes 
 ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA's daughter , and ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had come to visit ProtagonistA 
 They hugged each other and then sat down to talk 
 They talked for a long time , and it was a very happy visit 
The first time ProtagonistB had seen ProtagonistA , when ProtagonistA had been a boy called Spike , ProtagonistB had been struck by ProtagonistA's beauty 
 ProtagonistA was unlike any other girl ProtagonistB had ever seen 
 ProtagonistB had been instantly smitten 
 ProtagonistB had tried to talk to ProtagonistA on several occasions , but ProtagonistA had always seemed nervous and shy around ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB had been about to give up hope when , one day , ProtagonistA had finally spoken to ProtagonistB 
 They had struck up a conversation and ProtagonistB had found out that ProtagonistA was interested in the same things as ProtagonistB 
 They had become friends quickly and ProtagonistB had started to develop deeper feelings for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been planning to tell ProtagonistA how ProtagonistB felt , but before ProtagonistB could , ProtagonistA had started dating someone else 
 ProtagonistB had been heartbroken , but had tried to hide it 
 ProtagonistB had continued to be friends with ProtagonistA , even though it had been difficult 
 ProtagonistB had been happy for ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA had got married and had children , even though it had made ProtagonistB feel even more alone 
 Now , many years later , ProtagonistB was still single and ProtagonistA was divorced 
 They had both come to the same party and , for the first time in years , ProtagonistB had felt that old spark of attraction 
 They had spent the night talking and laughing and ProtagonistB had felt like ProtagonistB was finally home 
 It was taken when ProtagonistA was just a foal , and ProtagonistA's mother and father were both alive 
 They had all been laughing and joking , and ProtagonistA's mother had been so happy 
 Now , ProtagonistA's mother was gone , and ProtagonistB was barely hanging on 
 The cancer had taken so much from ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was weak enough as it was 
 It was a clear night , and the stars were shining bright , but ProtagonistA just could n't enjoy them 
 ProtagonistB had been acting strange lately 
 ProtagonistB was always either moping around or getting angry for no reason 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear ProtagonistB come into the room 
 ProtagonistB ! What are ProtagonistB doing ProtagonistB just stared at ProtagonistA for a moment before ProtagonistB finally spoke 
  ProtagonistB could n't sleep , so ProtagonistB came to look at the stars 
 But now ProtagonistB see that ProtagonistA 're here too 
 What about ProtagonistA was just worried about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB 've been acting really strange lately 
 ProtagonistB sighed and sat down on the bed 
  ProtagonistB know 
 ProtagonistB do n't know what 's wrong with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB just feel really lost right now 
 Rainbow Dash sat down next to ProtagonistB and put a comforting wing around ProtagonistB 
  It 's okay , ProtagonistB 
 We 'll figure it out together 
ProtagonistA burst through the door to ProtagonistB's room , screaming ,  What 's happened ?  ProtagonistB was sitting on ProtagonistB's bed , looking pale and shaken 
  ProtagonistB do n't know ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB was just sitting here and suddenly everything went dark 
 ProtagonistB ca n't see anything 
  ProtagonistA's heart sank 
 This was ProtagonistA's worst nightmare come true 
 ProtagonistB had been born blind 
 And now , it seemed , ProtagonistB was going deaf as well 
 But ProtagonistB just shook ProtagonistB's head 
  ProtagonistB ca n't hear anything either 
 This was just too much to bear 
 ProtagonistA held out ProtagonistA's hand and ProtagonistB came closer , sniffing at ProtagonistA's fingers 
 Then , to ProtagonistA's amazement , ProtagonistB spoke 
 Good evening , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB 'm Twilight 
 ProtagonistB 'm sorry to intrude , but ProtagonistB could n't help but notice ProtagonistA's apple 
 May ProtagonistB have a bite?Alice was so surprised that ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistB took a bite , then sat on ProtagonistB's haunches and began to eat 
 As ProtagonistB ate , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life in the forest 
 ProtagonistB told of the other animals ProtagonistB lived with and the adventures ProtagonistB had had 
 ProtagonistA was entranced 
 When ProtagonistB had finished the apple , ProtagonistB bid ProtagonistA goodnight and hopped away into the darkness 
The first time I saw ProtagonistA drape the tray table of ProtagonistA's crib across the kitchen window , it was ProtagonistB , looking through the window and murmuring ,  Oh , there 's ProtagonistC 
  I was so startled that I dropped my book 
 ProtagonistB turned to me with a smile 
  Did n't mean to scare you ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB just wanted to get a better look 
 I peered out the window with ProtagonistB 
 Sure enough , there was ProtagonistC standing in the alley below , looking up at us 
 ProtagonistC was dirty and ragged , but there was something about ProtagonistC's eyes that made me feel sorry for ProtagonistC 
 Do ProtagonistB think ProtagonistC 's lost ?  I asked 
 ProtagonistB shrugged 
  Maybe 
 But ProtagonistC looks like ProtagonistC could use a friend 
 Before I could stop ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB had climbed out the window and was down in the alley with ProtagonistC 
 I watched from above as they talked and laughed together 
 It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship 
 ProtagonistA was instantly attracted to ProtagonistB and they began dating 
  ProtagonistA 'm so glad we get to be best friends!The two ponies had been inseparable since they were foals , and now they were finally old enough to go on adventures together 
 They had already explored the meadow and the forest , and now they were venturing into the dangerous Dark Woods 
 Be careful , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB 
  The Dark Woods are full of dangerous creatures 
 I will ,  promised ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA okay ?  ProtagonistB asked , worried 
 ProtagonistB ran towards ProtagonistA , knife raised , and ProtagonistA turned and ran the other way 
 ProtagonistB chased ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was able to lose ProtagonistB 
 The police were called and ProtagonistB was arrested for the murder of ProtagonistB's wife 
 ProtagonistB always hushed ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA spoke , and ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream when ProtagonistA was with ProtagonistB 
 One day , ProtagonistB passed away 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 So that 's what ProtagonistA did 
Some time before the disaster that afflicted the city of Traver , under the watchful eye of the wizard of ProtagonistD , a young maiden named Padma Praline of the house of Pommaries , stood before the Great CENTIME , and told the tale of ProtagonistA , by the spirited chaperone of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was born into a noble family , but ProtagonistA's parents died when ProtagonistA was still a child 
 ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB was also a very strict man 
 ProtagonistB did not approve of ProtagonistA's desire to learn about the world and to help others 
 ProtagonistC was a kind and gentle man , and ProtagonistC quickly fell in love with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB did not approve of the relationship , and ProtagonistB forbid them to see each other 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken , but ProtagonistA did not give up on ProtagonistA's love for ProtagonistC 
 Then , one day , ProtagonistB caught them together 
 ProtagonistB was so angry that ProtagonistB disowned ProtagonistA and threw ProtagonistA out of the house 
 ProtagonistC was surprised to see ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistC was happy to have ProtagonistA there with ProtagonistC 
 They were married soon after , and they lived happily together for the rest of their days 
 ProtagonistE finished ProtagonistE's story , and the Great CENTIME was silent for a moment 
 Then it spoke 
Rose looked out over the plain , but on the sound of a distant voice ProtagonistA knew exactly where ProtagonistA was 
 It was the sound of ProtagonistB's voice , calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistB was running towards ProtagonistB , and as they met they embraced each other tightly 
 It 's kind of late to be doing that , do n't ProtagonistA think ?  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistA was just curious about it , that 's all 
 Well , ProtagonistA should n't be standing out here by ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  It 's not safe 
 Wait ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Let ProtagonistB walk ProtagonistA home 
  Thank ProtagonistB 
 The man walked with ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's house , and made sure ProtagonistA got inside safely 
 ProtagonistA was lost 
 ProtagonistA was lost 
 ProtagonistB was surprised to see ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB invited ProtagonistA in 
 ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA some food and a bed for the night 
 ProtagonistA's hair was thin and white , and ProtagonistA's face was covered in wrinkles 
 ProtagonistB was the only person who really talked to ProtagonistA 
 Everyone else in the village just ignored ProtagonistA , or spoke to ProtagonistA in a patronising way 
 But ProtagonistB treated ProtagonistA with respect , and they would often spend hours chatting together 
 ProtagonistB was sad to hear this , but ProtagonistB did n't try to dissuade ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was the only one who came to ProtagonistA's funeral 
 As ProtagonistB stood there alone , ProtagonistB felt a great sense of loss 
 Then , ProtagonistA's boss chewed ProtagonistA out for being late 
 To top it all off , ProtagonistA got stuck in traffic on the way home 
 To ProtagonistA's surprise , it was ProtagonistB 
  Oh , ah , no ou'er here - not here at all - ah , no need to pester ProtagonistA 
 No ! No !  ProtagonistB shrieked , and a rain of feathers slammed into ProtagonistA's head 
 It was only when ProtagonistA overheard some of the other ponies talking that ProtagonistA realized just how different ProtagonistB was 
 Apparently , ponies were n't supposed to be able to change their appearance at will , but ProtagonistB could 
 ProtagonistB could make ProtagonistB's mane and tail any color ProtagonistB wanted , and ProtagonistB could make ProtagonistB's eyes any size or shape 
 The other ponies did n't know what to make of ProtagonistB , and neither did ProtagonistA 
 As far as ProtagonistB was concerned , ProtagonistB was just like any other pony 
 Dreams where ProtagonistA was falling , or being chased 
 ProtagonistA's heart was pounding in ProtagonistA's chest and ProtagonistA was sweating 
 ProtagonistB believed ProtagonistA and promised to help ProtagonistA's figure out what was going on 
 together , they did some research and discovered that ProtagonistA was experiencing sleep paralysis 
 It was a scary experience , but at least ProtagonistA knew what was happening 
 ProtagonistB had on a blue cardigan with a white T - shirt underneath , a pair of jeans with a hole in the knee and a pair of high heels 
 They both laughed and commented on how they looked like they were going to a costume party 
 After they had a few drinks and some dinner , they decided to go dancing 
 They went to a club and danced the night away 
 They had so much fun that they forgot to go home 
 They ended up spending the night at ProtagonistB's house 
 In the morning , they woke up and got dressed 
 They both agreed that it was one of the best nights they had ever had 
ProtagonistB was a detective , working in the North of England , and ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA 'd never seen anything like it 
 ProtagonistB had been working on a case for weeks , and ProtagonistB was getting nowhere 
 ProtagonistB was getting frustrated , and ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was worried 
 One night , ProtagonistB came home late , and ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB 'd been drinking 
 ProtagonistB sat down at the kitchen table , and ProtagonistA could see the pain in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB was afraid that ProtagonistB was never going to solve it 
 ProtagonistB hugged ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could see the tears in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 The next day , ProtagonistB went back to work , and ProtagonistB was determined to solve the case 
 A few days later , ProtagonistB came home , and ProtagonistB was triumphant 
 ProtagonistB had solved the case , and ProtagonistB was a hero 
 ProtagonistA's latest victim was ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB 'm not sure ,  ProtagonistB replied 
  ProtagonistB was thinking maybe we could wait for a while and see what happens 
 ProtagonistB was the one who was always eager to take risks 
  We do n't want to make any rash decisions 
  They both knew that the diamond market was volatile 
 It was always changing and it was hard to predict what would happen next 
 They had to be careful 
  ProtagonistB agreed 
 They both knew that they had to be patient 
 The diamond market was never easy to predict 
 They were some of ProtagonistA's closest friends and ProtagonistA had known them for years 
 So when ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB to their home for the first time , ProtagonistB was excited to meet them 
 ProtagonistB was not disappointed 
 The Apple family was warm and welcoming , and ProtagonistB immediately felt at ease in their company 
 They showed ProtagonistB around their home and introduced ProtagonistB to their children 
 ProtagonistB had never felt so welcome before 
 ProtagonistB quickly became good friends with the Apple children , and ProtagonistB loved spending time at their home 
 ProtagonistB always looked forward to ProtagonistB's visits , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB would always cherish ProtagonistB's memories of the Apple family 
ProtagonistA's mother had been trying to talk ProtagonistA into taking a trip to ProtagonistB for years , but ProtagonistA had always resisted 
 The journey was long and hard , but it was worth it when ProtagonistA saw the look of joy on ProtagonistA's mother 's face 
 They spent their days exploring ProtagonistB and meeting new ponies , and ProtagonistA was finally able to see what ProtagonistA's mother had been trying to tell ProtagonistA all along 
 There was something special about ProtagonistB that could n't be found anywhere else 
 ProtagonistA's friends ran to get help , and ProtagonistB , came to ProtagonistA's aid 
 ProtagonistB held ProtagonistA's hoof flat against the back of ProtagonistA's head and used ProtagonistB's magic to lift ProtagonistA into the air and carry ProtagonistA back to ProtagonistA's home 
 The rest of ProtagonistA's body relaxed into the hovering motion of the completed form , and ProtagonistA was soon safe at home 
 The landscape was eerily familiar , yet completely unfamiliar at the same time 
 It looked oddly familiar , but ProtagonistA could n't place why 
 There was no answer 
  ProtagonistA , is that ProtagonistA ?  The voice sounded old and frail 
 ProtagonistA's heart skipped a beat 
 It was the voice of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB in years , not since the day ProtagonistB died 
 This was a place for the dead 
 But before ProtagonistA could turn to run , the door of the cottage opened and ProtagonistB appeared 
 ProtagonistB looked exactly as ProtagonistA remembered ProtagonistB , except ProtagonistB was transparent 
 Yes , ProtagonistB am ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB 've been waiting for ProtagonistA 
 It 's time to go , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA's hand and led ProtagonistA out of the cottage 
 Soon , it was as if ProtagonistA had never been there at all 
ProtagonistB had been playing with ProtagonistA near the edge of a ruined stream when ProtagonistA suddenly lost ProtagonistA's footing 
 ProtagonistB quickly grabbed onto ProtagonistA to keep ProtagonistA from falling in , but in the process , ProtagonistB lost ProtagonistB's own footing and they both ended up tumbling into the stream 
 Luckily , the water was n't too deep and they were both able to stand up 
 However , their clothes were soaked and they were both shivering from the cold 
 They made their way back to shore and ProtagonistB promised to be more careful in the future 
 It was ProtagonistA's first time visiting the Palace and ProtagonistA was determined to make a good impression 
  ProtagonistB smiled and said ,  Welcome , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB am sure ProtagonistA will be a great asset to ProtagonistB's court 
 ProtagonistA was lost in thought , wondering if anyone out there was looking back at ProtagonistA 
 It was a peaceful night , and the stars were so bright 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps approaching ProtagonistA 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA was snapped out of ProtagonistA's reverie by a voice 
  Hey there 
 ProtagonistB was looking at ProtagonistA with a curious expression 
 Do ProtagonistA mind if ProtagonistB join ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 ProtagonistB sat down next to ProtagonistA and they both resumed staring up at the stars 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistB spoke again 
 Do ProtagonistA believe in aliens ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 I do ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB think there 's life out there , somewhere 
 Maybe they 're looking at us right now , wondering the same thing 
  That would be pretty cool 
 ProtagonistB smiled 
  Yeah , it would 
 They sat in silence for a while longer , both lost in thought 
 Then , ProtagonistB stood up 
 I should probably get going ,  ProtagonistB said 
  It was nice meeting ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB walked away , then turned ProtagonistA's gaze back to the stars 
 Finally , the moment arrived 
 The paperwork was placed in front of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA signed it with a flourish 
 Now ProtagonistB was free , and ProtagonistB would be able to come home 
 It was going to be a happy reunion indeed 
 It was ProtagonistB's favorite , and ProtagonistA was hoping to impress ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's cooking skills 
 ProtagonistB took a bite , and ProtagonistB's face lit up 
 But now , ProtagonistA had neither excuse 
 When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA was greeted by ProtagonistB 
 They hugged and cried and laughed , and ProtagonistA was finally able to meet ProtagonistA's grandchildren 
 It was a beautiful day , made even more so by the reunion of ProtagonistA and daughter 
  What good dares ProtagonistA do , brother ?  ProtagonistB said 
  If ProtagonistA sees ProtagonistB by the pool , ProtagonistA 'll kill the boys !  ProtagonistC was taken aback by ProtagonistB's words 
 ProtagonistC knew ProtagonistB was joking , but ProtagonistC also knew that ProtagonistC would have to be careful around ProtagonistB from now on 
 ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA and smiled 
  Hey , ProtagonistA 
  Just wanted to see what ProtagonistB were up to 
 Just reading this old journal ,  ProtagonistB said 
  It belonged to ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was a bit of a history buff , and ProtagonistC loved to write 
 Oh , just some of the things ProtagonistC did during ProtagonistC's life ,  ProtagonistB replied 
  ProtagonistC was quite a character , from what ProtagonistB can tell 
 ProtagonistB hesitated for a moment , then handed the journal over 
  Sure , why not ? ProtagonistB think ProtagonistA 'll enjoy it 
 The journal was filled with ProtagonistC's thoughts and musings on life , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA quickly absorbed in it 
  ProtagonistC was an amazing man , was n't he?Her father nodded 
  Yes , ProtagonistC was 
 ProtagonistB 'm glad ProtagonistA got to know ProtagonistC a little bit , through ProtagonistC's journal 
  ProtagonistA too , ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA too 
 Good morning , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB 
 I wanted to get a head start on the day ,  said ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB smiled and took the cupcake 
  ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB so well ,  ProtagonistB said 
 The two of them sat down at the table and enjoyed their breakfast together 
 They chatted about their plans for the day and caught up on each other 's news 
 It was a lovely way to start the day 
It was the summer day in 1833 that ProtagonistA , was walking ProtagonistA's daughter , Mrs
 John Polkiss , down the road , and considering in ProtagonistA's mind whether ProtagonistA should continue to be a single mother , or if ProtagonistA should go back to the family home , and , indeed , if ProtagonistA should , to marry a man 
 ProtagonistB was a handsome man , and ProtagonistA could n't help but stare at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was John Polkiss , the man ProtagonistA had been thinking about marrying 
 It was as if fate had brought them together 
ProtagonistB had always been curious about ProtagonistA's magic powers 
 ProtagonistB had never seen ProtagonistA use them , but ProtagonistB knew they existed 
 So , when the day the earth froze , ProtagonistA used the last of ProtagonistA's magic power to reveal to ProtagonistB the greatest secret of all , ProtagonistB was thrilled 
 It was an amazing experience for both of them 
 ProtagonistC was trying to prove that ProtagonistA was not in ProtagonistA's right mind at the time of the murder and that ProtagonistA should be found not guilty by reason of insanity 
 ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA what had happened on the day of the murder 
 ProtagonistD asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA had killed ProtagonistB 
 The jury found ProtagonistA not guilty by reason of insanity and ProtagonistA was committed to a mental institution 
 The sun was beating down on ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was getting thirsty 
 It sounded like someone was coming 
 Soon , ProtagonistB came into view 
 ProtagonistB was walking quickly , and ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was in a hurry 
 ProtagonistB looked scared , and ProtagonistB was carrying a gun 
 They were shouting and getting closer 
 They were both carrying guns , and they looked like they were about to kill ProtagonistB 
 They both turned and looked at ProtagonistA 
 For a moment , they were both surprised 
 ProtagonistC tried to shoot ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was too quick 
 The two men were both down , but ProtagonistA knew they were n't going to stay down for long 
 However , ProtagonistB was persistent , and eventually ProtagonistA relented and gave ProtagonistB a small smile 
 It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship 
 The door was slightly ajar , and ProtagonistA could hear voices coming from inside 
 There were two people inside , ProtagonistC and ProtagonistB , and they were arguing 
 ProtagonistB was crying , and ProtagonistC was yelling 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistC stormed out of the cottage , slamming the door behind ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB collapsed onto the floor , sobbing 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA , and they began to talk 
 ProtagonistB had been arguing with ProtagonistD , and ProtagonistB was upset because ProtagonistD had just moved out 
 ProtagonistB smiled and thanked ProtagonistA again 
 Then ProtagonistB got up and went to bed 
 To top it all off , ProtagonistA's best friend was mad at ProtagonistA for something ProtagonistA had said the day before 
 ProtagonistB had always been a loyal friend , and ProtagonistB could tell that ProtagonistA was having a tough day 
 ProtagonistB sat with ProtagonistA until ProtagonistA felt better , and then went on ProtagonistB's way 
Mare slits the muzzle of ProtagonistB's gun into the air and lets out a little whine of Oops ! around the top of ProtagonistA's throat 
 Now ProtagonistB is going to be so mad 
 ProtagonistA 've been meaning to write to ProtagonistB for a long time , but ProtagonistA 'm not sure if ProtagonistB ever got ProtagonistA's previous letters 
 ProtagonistA 'm sorry for not keeping in better touch , but ProtagonistA 've been really busy lately 
 Love , ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had always been a bridesmaid ; ProtagonistA's father had promised a wedding for ProtagonistA and had lived up to that 
 However , when ProtagonistA's father died , ProtagonistA was left with no husband and no wedding 
 ProtagonistA was forced to move in with ProtagonistA's aunt and uncle , who were not very fond of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been married to ProtagonistA's best friend , who had died in a car accident 
 ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA became friends and eventually got married 
 ProtagonistA was thrown into the back of a van and driven to an unknown location 
 When the van stopped , ProtagonistA was dragged out and thrown into a dark room 
 Suddenly , a light was turned on and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB's face 
 ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's boss ! ProtagonistB had always been creepy , but ProtagonistA never thought ProtagonistB would kidnap ProtagonistA 
  If ProtagonistA make a sound , ProtagonistB 'll kill ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistA was terrified 
 ProtagonistB appreciated the support and understanding , but ProtagonistB was still worried 
 ProtagonistB could n't help but worry about the future and what it might hold 
 ProtagonistB was the one who had to make the decisions and ProtagonistB was the one who had to worry about the future 
 That is , until ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was the new kid in school and ProtagonistB was smart , really smart 
 ProtagonistB knew things that ProtagonistA had never even heard of before 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated by ProtagonistB and quickly became ProtagonistB's friend 
 Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB , for showing ProtagonistA that there was always more to learn 
 ProtagonistB looked familiar , but ProtagonistA could n't quite place ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA , it 's me , John 
 ProtagonistB 've been looking for ProtagonistA everywhere 
 ProtagonistB 'm so glad ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was confused 
 This is the place between life and death 
 ProtagonistB 've been stuck here for years , ever since ProtagonistB's car accident 
 But ProtagonistB finally found a way out and ProtagonistB came to find ProtagonistA 
 Maybe ProtagonistB could help ProtagonistA get back to reality 
 Come with ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'll show ProtagonistA the way out 
 Together , they walked through the strange place , until they finally came to a door 
 ProtagonistB opened it and gestured for ProtagonistA to go through 
 It worked !  ProtagonistB exclaimed 
 ProtagonistA hugged ProtagonistB , tears of joy streaming down ProtagonistA's face 
 Don't thank ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB replied 
  Thank ProtagonistA 
 What are ProtagonistA looking at , ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB peered over ProtagonistA's shoulder at ProtagonistA 
  They 're all so happy 
   They look it ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB wish ProtagonistB could have a family like that 
  ProtagonistB 're part of ProtagonistA's family now 
 ProtagonistB did n't know who ProtagonistA was , but ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB wanted to be ProtagonistA's friend 
 ProtagonistB walked up to ProtagonistA and said ,  Hi , ProtagonistB's name is ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB smiled and said ,  That 's a pretty name 
 ProtagonistB took it and ProtagonistA shook hands 
Sweetie-6 was sitting in the park , watching the children play 
  Are n't ProtagonistB going to go home ? said Sweetie-6 , scratching ProtagonistA's head 
  ProtagonistB shrugged ProtagonistB's shoulders and said that ProtagonistB did n't know 
 Sweetie-6 told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB should go home , because it was getting late 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB did n't want to go home , because ProtagonistB did n't want to be alone 
 Sweetie-6 told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB could come and sit with ProtagonistA for a while , and then ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistB's home 
 ProtagonistB agreed , and the two of them sat in the park together until it was time for ProtagonistB to go home 
 ProtagonistB neighed softly as ProtagonistA ran the brush through ProtagonistB's mane 
 Those were the days when ProtagonistA was carefree and happy 
 It was a special bond that ProtagonistA cherished 
 ProtagonistB approached ProtagonistA , a satisfied smirk on ProtagonistB's face 
  Just another trophy for ProtagonistB's collection ,  ProtagonistB said coldly as ProtagonistB pulled out ProtagonistB's knife to skin ProtagonistA 
 The last thing ProtagonistA saw was ProtagonistB's knife coming towards ProtagonistA , before everything went black 
ProtagonistA rode silently toward ProtagonistA's cabin , ProtagonistA's eyes half - closed and ProtagonistA's mind racing in its mind 's eye 
 It seemed like only yesterday ProtagonistA had been living a normal life , going to work and spending time with ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistB stepped out into the light , and ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistB was a woman 
 ProtagonistB was holding a gun , and ProtagonistB looked very tired 
 So when ProtagonistA came to ProtagonistB one day and told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had found a new place for them to live , ProtagonistB was n't really surprised 
 What did surprise ProtagonistB , however , was the place ProtagonistA had found 
 ProtagonistB was scared at first , but ProtagonistA assured ProtagonistB that there was nothing to be afraid of 
  And we 'll be the heroes of our own story 
 So ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA moved into the old house in the woods and began their adventure 
 They soon found out that the stories about ProtagonistC were true , but they also found out that ProtagonistC was n't really a bad person 
 In fact , ProtagonistC was quite lonely and was happy to have some company 
 ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA became good friends with ProtagonistC and would often sit by the fire and listen to ProtagonistC's stories 
 It was a magical time for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB knew that this was a story ProtagonistB would always remember 
 Then , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB was moving away 
 It was ProtagonistC , asking ProtagonistA to help ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistC was n't really gone 
 ProtagonistC was just hurt and needed ProtagonistA's help 
 ProtagonistC was going to be okay 
 Even though ProtagonistA's day had started out terrible , it had ended on a good note 
 ProtagonistA was reminded that ProtagonistA always had the power to help others , even when it felt like ProtagonistA's own world was falling apart 
 Oh , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA ,  do ProtagonistB remember what ProtagonistA did this ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA and shook ProtagonistB's head 
 I'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB ca n't help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was n't with ProtagonistA this morning 
  Relief washed over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA finally remembered what ProtagonistA had done 
ProtagonistA was conceived in the winter of my year , seventeen months after ProtagonistB was twenty - four years old 
 ProtagonistA was born in the great Kingdom of Equestria , which was in a tier - one position at the time 
 ProtagonistA was loved by all , especially ProtagonistA's two closest friends , Malachite of the Crystal Metals and ProtagonistB 
 The three of them were inseparable , and they always had each other 's backs , no matter what 
 One day , when they were out on a quest together , they ran into a group of bandits 
 The bandits were heavily armed and outnumbered them three to one 
 ProtagonistA's friends were amazed at ProtagonistA's power , and they knew that ProtagonistA was destined for great things 
 ProtagonistA was loved by all , and ProtagonistA lived a long and happy life with ProtagonistA's two best friends by ProtagonistA's side 
 ProtagonistB must have gone home 
 ProtagonistA felt like a fool , like ProtagonistA had been played for a fool 
 But it turned out ProtagonistB had only wanted one thing from ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had given it to ProtagonistB so easily 
 ProtagonistA turned and walked away from ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA's head held high 
 ProtagonistB ?  said ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's hoof hovering over the apple cart 
  Are ProtagonistB sure ProtagonistB want to do this?I'm positive ,  said ProtagonistB 
  After all , we 've been planning this for months 
 But what if something goes wrong?Nothing will go wrong ,  said ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB have everything under control 
 Haggerty 
 Don't worry , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB wo n't let anything happen to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a reassuring smile and began to push the cart down the hill 
 At first , everything went according to plan 
 The cart picked up speed and ProtagonistA began to scream , but ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA was enjoying the ride 
 The wind was whipping through ProtagonistA's hair and ProtagonistA felt alive 
 There was a large rock in the middle of the path and the cart was heading straight for it 
 But it was too late 
 The cart slammed into the rock and overturned , sending ProtagonistA flying through the air 
 ProtagonistA ! Speak to ProtagonistB !  said ProtagonistB , frantic 
Alice and ProtagonistA were just finishing up loading ProtagonistA's car when they noticed their neighbors peering through their windows with panicked looks on their faces 
 Alice and James exchanged confused glances before quickly finishing up and getting into the car 
 ProtagonistB was followed by a man , and then another , and another , until it seemed like the whole neighborhood was filled with people running and screaming 
 Alice and ProtagonistA ran inside and locked all the doors and windows , huddling together in the living room as they listened to the chaos outside 
 It was a chilly , dark , and stormy morning , and Alice and James were surrounded by the hysterical hearers 
ProtagonistA has been seen seated on the floor , ProtagonistA's heels creaking slightly , the air of a confined space , and ProtagonistA sits quietly , a slight air of nervousness attached to ProtagonistA , as if ProtagonistA were about to lose ProtagonistA's temper 
 It was small , with no windows and only one door 
 The door was locked , and ProtagonistA had the key 
 ProtagonistA was given food and water , but no one came to check on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB looked around the room before settling ProtagonistB's gaze on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm here to help ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB know this must be hard for ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB continued 
  But ProtagonistB promise , ProtagonistB 'm here to help ProtagonistA 
 I'm going to get ProtagonistA out of here , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA's help 
 ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA to trust ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB replied 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA what ProtagonistB needed ProtagonistA to do and ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB's instructions 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA was brave and ProtagonistA smiled 
 ProtagonistA had been ridden by many people , but ProtagonistA's favorite was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB would come to the farm every day and brush ProtagonistA's mane and give ProtagonistA a carrot 
 One day , ProtagonistB did n't come to the farm 
 The next day , ProtagonistB came to the farm , but ProtagonistB was different 
 ProtagonistB was sad and ProtagonistB's eyes were red 
 ProtagonistB did n't say anything , ProtagonistB just hugged ProtagonistA's neck and cried 
 Life was good 
 But then , ProtagonistB Sparkle came into the room and ruined everything 
 I'm out of cupcakes ,  ProtagonistB said , looking miserable 
  And ProtagonistB really wanted one 
 Oh , ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's smile fading 
 It 's not the same ,  ProtagonistB said , pouting 
  ProtagonistB wanted that one 
 ProtagonistB was out of cupcakes , and ProtagonistB was not happy about it 
 After a bit of convincing , ProtagonistC finally handed it over 
 They were both relieved to be reunited 
 But there was still the matter of why ProtagonistB had been imprisoned 
 That would have to wait for another day 
 For now , they were just happy to be together again 
Twilight Sparkle was out of cupcakes 
 It had all started innocently enough 
 It was the perfect plan 
 But ProtagonistB did 
 ProtagonistB reached under the counter and grabbed ProtagonistA by the arm 
  ProtagonistB knew someone was stealing ProtagonistB's cupcakes !  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistA was dragged out of the shop and into the back room 
 ProtagonistB tied ProtagonistA to a chair and began to interrogate ProtagonistA 
  Why are ProtagonistA stealing ProtagonistB's cupcakes ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 Cake looked at ProtagonistA sympathetically 
  ProtagonistB understand ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB 'm going to have to call the police 
 ProtagonistA was taken to the police station and charged with theft 
 ProtagonistA was given a stern warning and told to stay away from the cupcake shop 
 ProtagonistA had been born six months earlier , and ProtagonistA's mother had died shortly after giving birth 
 ProtagonistB had been away on business when ProtagonistA was born , and by the time ProtagonistB got back , ProtagonistA's mother had passed away 
 ProtagonistA had been raised by ProtagonistA's grandparents since then , and they had told ProtagonistA all about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC was handsome , and ProtagonistC looked a lot like ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was confused 
 ProtagonistC introduced ProtagonistC as ProtagonistA's father 
 ProtagonistC explained that ProtagonistC had been away on business when ProtagonistA was born and that ProtagonistC had only recently found out about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistC said that ProtagonistC had been looking for ProtagonistA for months 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled to finally meet ProtagonistB 
 They talked and laughed all the way to the Smithers 
 When they arrived , ProtagonistB invited ProtagonistA to come and live with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistB was always telling ProtagonistA to hurry up 
  Come on , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB would say 
  We do n't want to be late for ProtagonistA's piano lesson 
  There 's no hurry , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC would tell ProtagonistA 
  Life is too short to rush through it 
  But ProtagonistB was always in a hurry 
 ProtagonistB was always rushing around , trying to get things done 
  Come on , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB would say 
  Let 's go 
ProtagonistA was perched on the edge of a high bank , snapping the last few pennies from ProtagonistA's neck when ProtagonistA heard the call of an emergency 
 It was a short ride , but it made ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistB 
 Some would even applaud 
There was ProtagonistA 
 They had been together for two years and were very happy 
 One day , ProtagonistB proposed to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA said yes 
 They were both very excited and began planning their wedding 
 Everything was going great until ProtagonistC found out about the engagement 
 ProtagonistC was not happy about it and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could not marry ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken and did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistB was holding a telescope , and ProtagonistB offered it to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about the constellations and the stories behind them 
 ProtagonistA was entranced 
 It seemed like ProtagonistA's feet had a mind of their own , carrying ProtagonistA away from ProtagonistA's old life and into this new one 
 The sun was setting now , and ProtagonistA could see a faint light in the distance 
 It was small and rundown , but it was home 
 ProtagonistB stood there , ProtagonistB's face lined with years of worry and hardship 
 But when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB's eyes lit up with hope 
 ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA were never coming back 
 The sun was setting behind the mountains , and the sky was a beautiful shades of orange and red 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB must have followed ProtagonistA 
 Rainbow Dash , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 But ProtagonistA do n't even know what 's on the other side ,  ProtagonistB said 
ProtagonistB eyed ProtagonistA , but had no intention of touching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB did n't want to ruin ProtagonistA's perfect image with ProtagonistB's own messiness 
  ProtagonistA 'm here for ProtagonistB 
  From that moment on , ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB could always count on ProtagonistA to be there for ProtagonistB , no matter what 
 Suddenly , the door to the room opened and ProtagonistB walked in 
 But ProtagonistB just smiled and walked over to ProtagonistA 
 It 's okay , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB do n't mind if ProtagonistA use ProtagonistB's desk 
 In fact , ProtagonistB think it 's great that ProtagonistA 're curious about it 
 ProtagonistB then showed ProtagonistA how to use the desk 
 ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA how to hold the pen and how to make marks on the paper 
 That 's great , ProtagonistA !  said ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA 'll be writing like a pro in no time 
 And it was all thanks to ProtagonistA's curiosity 
 ProtagonistB was an interesting person , to say the least 
 ProtagonistB was always well - dressed and put - together , but there was something about ProtagonistB that made ProtagonistA want to know more 
 ProtagonistA had been born and raised in the bustling city of Camelot 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistB was hired 
 ProtagonistB ProtagonistA was soon demoted and then , eventually , forced to retire 
 ProtagonistB , quickly became ProtagonistC's favorite 
 ProtagonistB was always by ProtagonistC's side , protecting ProtagonistC and serving ProtagonistC 
 It was something about a rabbit and a hole 
 It was ProtagonistB 
  Good morning , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB was just out for ProtagonistB's morning walk and ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA sitting here 
 ProtagonistB hope ProtagonistA 're doing well 
   That 's interesting ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB sometimes have trouble remembering ProtagonistB's dreams , too 
 Well , ProtagonistB 'll let ProtagonistA get back to it 
 Have a good day 
ProtagonistA had been waiting for the moment , talking to ProtagonistB , when it would happen : here were ProtagonistA's feet , well - nigh barefoot , with their unkempt , patchy hair , and ProtagonistA's hands folded under the lids , as if ProtagonistA had been carrying them for some months , so that ProtagonistA's hands should have a little more room , and ProtagonistA's fingers a little less clumsy , than when ProtagonistA was twelve 
 It had been a long time since ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was excited to finally be able to talk to ProtagonistB about what was happening in ProtagonistA's life 
 So , ProtagonistA , what have ProtagonistA been up to ?  ProtagonistB asked , after they had exchanged pleasantries 
 ProtagonistA 'm also waiting for ProtagonistA's hands to be a little less clumsy , so that ProtagonistA can do more things with them 
 I see ,  ProtagonistB said , nodding ProtagonistB's head 
  It just feels right 
 Like it 's something ProtagonistA 'm supposed to do 
 I see ,  ProtagonistB said again 
 That sounds like a lot of fun ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA 're very good at all of those things 
 I'm sure that moment will come , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Just keep waiting and working hard , and it will happen 
 It seemed that ProtagonistB had been secretly stockpiling weapons and planning to overthrow the king 
 When ProtagonistA confronted ProtagonistB about it , ProtagonistB tried to kill ProtagonistA 
 The king and his army were able to stop ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's rebels before they could do any damage 
 ProtagonistA was hailed as a hero and ProtagonistA was able to live happily ever after 
 ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by ProtagonistB's ability to shoot an arrow with such accuracy , and ProtagonistA was determined to learn how to do it ProtagonistA 
 It flew straight and true , hitting the target dead center 
 ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA how to hold the bow and how to position the arrow 
 ProtagonistB then helped ProtagonistA take aim and release the arrow 
 It flew wide of the target , but ProtagonistA was thrilled nonetheless 
 It was a comfortable silence between them , one that did n't need to be filled with words 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it was true , that ProtagonistA's life was over 
 It did n't seem real 
 It was n't supposed to happen like this 
 ProtagonistB sat down on the floor next to ProtagonistA and put ProtagonistB's arm around ProtagonistA 
 I'm so sorry , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 It was a habit that ProtagonistA had developed over the years , ever since ProtagonistB was born 
 It was a small act of love that ProtagonistA did every day , and it always made ProtagonistA feel better 
 It was a way for ProtagonistA to show ProtagonistA's love and care for ProtagonistB , even if ProtagonistB was no longer a little filly 
 ProtagonistB was different than any of the other guys ProtagonistA had dated 
 They started dating seriously and after a few months , they got married 
When ProtagonistA froze in the doorway of ProtagonistA's house , ProtagonistB came toward ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was a tall , dark figure , draped in a cloak that seemed to absorb all the light around it 
 In ProtagonistB's hand ProtagonistB held a long , sharp blade 
 ProtagonistA's heart raced as ProtagonistB approached ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was paralyzed with fear 
 ProtagonistB reached ProtagonistA and grabbed ProtagonistA by the throat 
 ProtagonistB stared at ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's cold , dead eyes and then ProtagonistB spoke 
 I've come for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was too strong 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB brought ProtagonistA to a dark , dank dungeon 
 ProtagonistB threw ProtagonistA into a cell and then locked the door 
 ProtagonistA was left alone in the darkness , terrified of what ProtagonistB might do to ProtagonistA next 
  ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistA , where are ProtagonistA ?  It was ProtagonistB's voice 
  ProtagonistA ! Help ProtagonistB !  ProtagonistB cried 
 It was a beautiful sight 
 The sun was setting and the sky was a beautiful orange 
 ProtagonistB looked so peaceful as ProtagonistB floated by 
ProtagonistB was lying down under the wing of ProtagonistA , staring up at ProtagonistA's blue and white Pip Puff 
 ProtagonistB was thinking about how much ProtagonistB loved flying and how happy ProtagonistB was to be able to share that love with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB felt a warm breeze blowing through the feathers on ProtagonistB's back and knew that ProtagonistA was also enjoying the moment 
 ProtagonistB was hesitant , but finally relented 
 They set off on their journey and ProtagonistA was soon lost in thought , imagining all the adventures ProtagonistA would have 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA was brought out of ProtagonistA's reverie by a rustling in the bushes 
 ProtagonistB had disappeared and ProtagonistA was now alone 
 It was ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistB had been hiding , trying to scare ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to go back to ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistA did n't want to stay in the forest either 
 ProtagonistA was stuck in the middle , not knowing what to do 
 They were n't going to let ProtagonistA leave until ProtagonistA had convinced ProtagonistB to do so 
 ProtagonistA finally convinced ProtagonistB to come with ProtagonistA and they left for their adventure 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA's castle and asked ProtagonistA to marry ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistB answered , ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA 'm pregnant 
 At first , ProtagonistB did n't say anything 
 ProtagonistB just stood there , staring at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was quiet for a moment , then ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB 'm not ready to be a father 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistA turned and walked away , tears streaming down ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA had been told by the doctor that ProtagonistA would never be able to play again 
 This was devastating news for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was also told that ProtagonistA would need to have surgery to repair the damage 
 This would be a long and difficult recovery process 
 During ProtagonistA's recovery , ProtagonistB , was by ProtagonistA's side every step of the way 
 ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA with everything , from going to the bathroom to getting dressed 
 ProtagonistA had been kidnapped , held captive , and was about to be sold into slavery 
 But ProtagonistA was saved by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB placed ProtagonistA in the care of ProtagonistA's only friend , Applejack , and told ProtagonistA to never give up hope 
It was in the year 1763 when , in a county in western France , a small town named Vernay was formed , and the village of Neuve - Chalmers had its first residents 
 The name and the first and only dame which has ever been mentioned in the history of France , was Mary Moodie , a little lady of twenty - one , with a pretty face , fine features , and freckles , who , with ProtagonistB , was well known in the world for ProtagonistA's literary talent and for ProtagonistA's indomitable resolution 
 The village was located in a county in western France and was newly formed 
 Despite being the only residents , the couple was well known in the world for their literary talent and ProtagonistA's indomitable resolution 
 The village of Neuve - Chalmers was a quiet and peaceful place 
 The only sounds that could be heard were the birds chirping and the leaves rustling in the wind 
 It was the perfect place to live if you wanted to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city 
 It looked like it had been abandoned for years 
 They decided to explore it and see if there was anything of value inside 
 As they entered the cottage , they were surprised to find that it was clean and well - kept 
 It was obvious that someone had been living there 
 They looked around and saw that there were clothes and food in the cupboards 
 It was then that they realized that they had stumbled upon someone 's secret hideaway 
 They decided to leave the cottage and not tell anyone about their discovery 
 It was clear that the person who was living there wanted to be left alone and they respected that 
 Although they never saw the person who was living in the cottage , Mary and John would often wonder about them 
 They would often talk about the person and speculate about their life 
 They would imagine what their story was and how they ended up living in a hidden cottage in the forest 
 The years went by and eventually , Mary and John passed away 
 But , their story and the story of the hidden cottage in the forest lived on 
 However , there was something about ProtagonistA that made ProtagonistB suspect that ProtagonistA might be up to something 
 ProtagonistB was not the type of person to judge someone based on their appearance , but ProtagonistB could not help but be suspicious of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had met ProtagonistA for the first time a few weeks ago , and ProtagonistA seemed like ProtagonistA was hiding something 
 ProtagonistB was not sure what it was , but ProtagonistB was determined to find out 
 The next time ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB decided to follow ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was not sure what ProtagonistB was looking for , but ProtagonistB was hoping to find some clues 
 ProtagonistB followed ProtagonistA to a bar , and ProtagonistB watched as ProtagonistA talked to a few men 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA was flirting with them , and ProtagonistB was not sure what to think 
 ProtagonistB was about to leave when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA leave with one of the men 
 ProtagonistB followed them to a hotel , and ProtagonistB watched as they went into a room together 
 ProtagonistB was shocked , and ProtagonistB was not sure what to do 
 ProtagonistB was about to call the police when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA leave the room 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA had been up to something , and ProtagonistB was not sure what to do 
 ProtagonistB decided to confront ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA had been up to 
 ProtagonistB was about to call the police when ProtagonistA finally confessed 
 ProtagonistB was shocked , and ProtagonistB did not know what to say 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to get help , and ProtagonistB would not be able to help ProtagonistA anymore 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken , and ProtagonistA begged ProtagonistB to help ProtagonistA 
 However , ProtagonistB was not sure what ProtagonistB could do 
 ProtagonistB did not want to get involved , and ProtagonistB did not want to see ProtagonistA get hurt 
 In the end , ProtagonistB decided to call the police 
 ProtagonistA was taken away , and ProtagonistB never saw ProtagonistA again 
 ProtagonistB was relieved that ProtagonistB had made the right decision , and ProtagonistB was glad that ProtagonistB had not gotten involved 
ProtagonistB did not ask ProtagonistA to do anything , said ProtagonistC , and it was not a question ProtagonistB had thought about thoroughly , much less questioned 
 ProtagonistB was simply going about ProtagonistB's day , doing ProtagonistB's chores and minding ProtagonistB's own business , when ProtagonistB suddenly had the urge to ask ProtagonistA to help ProtagonistB with something 
 It was a small thing , really , but ProtagonistC could tell that it meant a lot to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC knew that ProtagonistC could n't say no , so ProtagonistC agreed 
 It did n't take long for ProtagonistA to realize that helping ProtagonistB was one of the best things ProtagonistA could have ever done 
 It was a beautiful moment that they shared , and ProtagonistA will always cherish it 
 ProtagonistB had been trying to warn ProtagonistA , to tell ProtagonistA that they were about to cast a spell that would take them to a different world entirely 
 But ProtagonistA had been so caught up in ProtagonistA's own excitement that ProtagonistA had n't heard ProtagonistB 
 And now it was too late 
ProtagonistB watched as ProtagonistA twisted and turned , ProtagonistA's hooves shifting as ProtagonistA tried to keep the position 
 As ProtagonistB watched , ProtagonistB felt a sense of pride welling up inside of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA would be a great dancer one day 
 ProtagonistB was asleep , ProtagonistB's head resting on ProtagonistA's lap 
 It was times like these that ProtagonistA cherished the most 
 Just ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB , spending time together in peace and quiet 
 ProtagonistB was watching over ProtagonistA's hooves - a delicate balance , ProtagonistA reasoned , between worry and excitement - and Shining Armor was resting on ProtagonistA's shoulder 
 When ProtagonistA crossed the finish line , ProtagonistA was met with applause from the crowd 
 ProtagonistA had been intrigued by the stories , and by the way ProtagonistB had looked in the photographs 
 ProtagonistB was a beautiful woman , with a kind face 
 ProtagonistB was a woman who had been through a lot , and who had come out the other side 
 The only thing ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistA had been sent here by ProtagonistB 
  All the history of the kingdom is buried here 
ProtagonistB watched as ProtagonistA twisted and turned , ProtagonistA's hooves shifting as ProtagonistA tried to keep the position 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was trying to find the perfect spot to lie down , but it just was n't happening 
 ProtagonistB felt bad for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB also knew that there was nothing ProtagonistB could do 
 ProtagonistB just had to wait it out and hope that ProtagonistA would eventually find a comfortable spot 
 ProtagonistB was always very supportive of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA to get started in ProtagonistA's career 
 However , ProtagonistB was also very interested in making money , and ProtagonistB often used ProtagonistB's position to get ProtagonistA's help in making money 
 This conflict of interest eventually became a serious problem , and it caused a lot of tension between ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB 
 However , ProtagonistA is still haunted by the conflict of interest with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA is often left wondering if ProtagonistA could have done more with ProtagonistA's life if ProtagonistA had not been so focused on making money 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB had been there for a while 
 Whiskers 
 They looked all around the neighborhood , but they could n't find ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a big hug and went on ProtagonistB's way 
  ProtagonistB do n't know why you put up with ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistA 's always been a troublemaker 
  ProtagonistA's mother just sighed and said ,  ProtagonistA 's our daughter , and we love ProtagonistA 
 So , when ProtagonistB found out that ProtagonistA had been cheating on ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB was not surprised 
 What did surprise ProtagonistB was the lengths ProtagonistA went to keep ProtagonistA's affair a secret 
 When ProtagonistB found out , ProtagonistB was devastated 
 ProtagonistB confronted ProtagonistA and demanded to know why ProtagonistA had done this to ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB was so angry that ProtagonistB tore ProtagonistA's arm off 
 ProtagonistB did n't even care that ProtagonistA was screaming in pain 
 All ProtagonistB cared about was the pain ProtagonistC was going through 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistC would never be able to forgive ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB did n't blame ProtagonistC 
 But today , something was different 
 ProtagonistB , came over to ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA , please get up ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB ca n't leave without ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA up and took ProtagonistA to the ferry 
 ProtagonistB sat ProtagonistA down and gave ProtagonistA a blanket 
  What 's wrong , ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 ProtagonistB stayed with ProtagonistA until the ferry arrived at the other side 
 Then ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA off and took ProtagonistA to the doctor 
 ProtagonistB was being killed in cold blood , right in front of ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistB would n't trust ProtagonistA , if only ProtagonistA were real 
 ProtagonistB 'd give ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's tongue , said the gleam of ProtagonistA's unicorn horn in ProtagonistB's pearly paling eyes 
 ProtagonistB had been following ProtagonistA for hours , it seemed , and ProtagonistB was getting tired 
 ProtagonistB had been so excited when ProtagonistB first saw ProtagonistA jump down the rabbit hole 
 ProtagonistB was sure that this was an adventure ProtagonistB would never forget 
 But now , ProtagonistB was n't so sure 
 There was a big house , and ProtagonistA had gone inside 
 ProtagonistB had tried to follow , but the door had slammed shut in ProtagonistB's face 
 ProtagonistB had been trying to find a way in ever since 
 ProtagonistB was just about to give up when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA again 
 ProtagonistB approached cautiously 
 ProtagonistB was n't sure if ProtagonistB could trust ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB was curious 
  Where have ProtagonistA been ? ProtagonistB 've been looking for ProtagonistA 
 The rabbit did n't answer 
  ProtagonistB 'm lost 
 ProtagonistB do n't know where ProtagonistB am 
 ProtagonistB was getting frustrated 
 ProtagonistB was about to give up when ProtagonistB saw the gleam in ProtagonistA's eye 
 It was the same gleam ProtagonistB had seen in the unicorn horn 
 ProtagonistA , if ProtagonistA 're real , then help ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB do n't know where ProtagonistB am 
 The rabbit hopped off the mushroom and led ProtagonistB to a door 
 ProtagonistB hesitated 
 ProtagonistB did n't know if ProtagonistB could trust ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistB was tired and lost , and ProtagonistB did n't know what else to do 
 ProtagonistB took a deep breath and stepped through the door 
Slow , steady , and thoughtful , the moment ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's seat at the table , Equestrians moved through the dark and the undulating hall of the palace , picking vixens and lasses out of the crowd and casting them away to dance with the three most beautiful sisters of the Siras Academy 
 ProtagonistB had a kind face and a warm smile , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart flutter in ProtagonistA's chest 
 The music started up , a slow , sensual melody that made ProtagonistA's skin prick with goosebumps 
 The Equestrians began to move , their hips undulating in time with the music 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA's hand and led ProtagonistA onto the dance floor 
 ProtagonistA was lost in the moment , and ProtagonistA did n't want it to end 
It was a cold , winter morning and ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were walking to school 
 ProtagonistB was carrying ProtagonistA's heavy backpack for ProtagonistA 
 They were two blocks from the school door and three blocks from the flat that always seemed to be the last place to put ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA went to sleep 
 ProtagonistB was tired and ProtagonistA's daughter could see it in ProtagonistB's eyes 
  ProtagonistB think ProtagonistA should ,  ProtagonistB replied 
 The door opened and ProtagonistA walked through 
 The flowers were glittering with the colors of magic 
 ProtagonistB was holding a lantern and ProtagonistB looked very old 
  ProtagonistB am the keeper of this garden ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB have been waiting for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB have been waiting for a very long time 
 ProtagonistB was very old and looked like ProtagonistB was about to die 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was the Emperor of the Day , and according to the law of physics , ProtagonistB was going to die in the year 5802 
 ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA the title of Emperor , and this made ProtagonistA powerful 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase 
 ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was going somewhere important 
ProtagonistB had been battling ovarian cancer for years , and ProtagonistA had been by ProtagonistB's side every step of the way 
 But the cancer had finally taken ProtagonistB's life , and ProtagonistA was left feeling lost and alone 
 And it was during that night that ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's first dream 
 ProtagonistB was smiling and ProtagonistB looked happy and at peace 
 Even an assassination attempt in the capital would be unlikely 
 Oh , ProtagonistB know it 's a bad idea 
 It just seems so final , you know ? Like ProtagonistA 'm giving up on everything 
 And besides , ProtagonistA know it 's the right thing to do 
It is a month of extreme hardship for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA can not possibly be surprised by the scene which I have set before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB's body is lying in state in the great hall of the castle , and ProtagonistA is weeping over it 
 All of ProtagonistB's belongings have been taken away , and ProtagonistA is the only one who has been left to mourn ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA is not surprised by the scene , but ProtagonistA is saddened by it 
 The owners of the casinos got wind of who ProtagonistA was and started banning ProtagonistA from their establishments 
 But ProtagonistA's luck eventually ran out 
 ProtagonistA lost everything ProtagonistA had and then some 
 It was a slippery slope from there 
 ProtagonistA ended up alone and penniless , ProtagonistA's once - great skills nothing but a memory 
 There was something about ProtagonistB's presence that was comforting 
 ProtagonistB sat down next to ProtagonistA and they watched the fire together in silence 
ProtagonistA's eighteenth year was the best year of ProtagonistA's life 
 They traveled all over the world , and they had the time of their lives 
 Every day was a new adventure , and they just could n't get enough of each other 
 They were truly in love 
 However , all good things must come to an end , and eventually they had to return home 
 They were both sad to leave their magical honeymoon behind , but they knew that they had to get back to reality 
 Even though they 're no longer on their honeymoon , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB's 's love for each other is stronger than ever 
 They cherish all of the memories they made on their honeymoon , and they know that they 'll never forget it 
 It was truly the best year of their lives 
 ProtagonistB had a top hat of ProtagonistB's own , which ProtagonistB was holding in ProtagonistB's hands 
 ProtagonistB was looking at ProtagonistA with a strange expression on ProtagonistB's face 
 I'm looking at ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Why are ProtagonistB here?I'm here to help ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 You're in danger ,  ProtagonistB said 
  What 's going to happen to me?I ca n't tell ProtagonistA that ,  ProtagonistB said 
 Well ProtagonistB 've done well indeed ,  said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA sat down next to ProtagonistB , looking up at the heavens above them with a kind of dislike and a kind of curiosity 
  ProtagonistB 've managed to find the only spot on this entire planet that is n't covered in pollution 
 I know ,  said ProtagonistB ,  but it was n't easy 
 It took ProtagonistB years to find this place 
 And now that ProtagonistB have , what are ProtagonistB going to do with it?I'm going to live here ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm going to build a house and live off the land 
 No , ProtagonistB 'm not ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm going to be happy 
 The file was for a divorce case and ProtagonistA was supposed to find any assets that the husband may have hidden from the wife 
  ProtagonistB 'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but we 're going to have to let ProtagonistA go 
 We just ca n't afford to keep ProtagonistA on any longer 
  ProtagonistB 'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB 'm going to have to let ProtagonistA go , too 
 We just ca n't afford to keep ProtagonistA on any longer 
 ProtagonistB , looked at ProtagonistA with a confused expression 
  Can ProtagonistB help ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked 
  ProtagonistB 'm sorry , we do n't offer that service ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But ProtagonistB can give ProtagonistA a list of people who might be able to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was determined to find a runner who could help ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA would find one on the list 
ProtagonistB discovered the existence of the world in a paper which was stuck on the back of ProtagonistA's desk , and which ProtagonistA picked up and read from time to time 
 ProtagonistB was fascinated by the thought of other people living in different places and having different experiences 
 ProtagonistB read about the different cultures and customs , and the different ways of life 
 ProtagonistB also read about the different religions and the different beliefs 
 ProtagonistB was particularly interested in the idea of reincarnation , and ProtagonistB read about it in the paper 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was getting married to ProtagonistB's second cousin , the Empress , and ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's blessing 
 ProtagonistA was terrified and ran as fast as ProtagonistA could in the opposite direction 
 ProtagonistA was exhausted and out of breath 
 ProtagonistB ProtagonistB was walking towards ProtagonistA with a gun in ProtagonistB's hand 
 ProtagonistA was frozen with fear 
ProtagonistB was smiling when ProtagonistA said to ProtagonistC , ProtagonistA would like to introduce ProtagonistA to Cadence 
 ProtagonistB had been worried that ProtagonistA was becoming too isolated and that ProtagonistA would never find true friends 
 But now it seemed like everything was going to be alright 
 It had been two years since ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was worried about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC looked just like ProtagonistB 
 Do ProtagonistC know her?The woman looked at ProtagonistA for a moment , and then ProtagonistC smiled 
  Yes , ProtagonistC know ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB 's ProtagonistC's daughter 
 They hugged each other and cried , and then they went back to ProtagonistC's house to catch up on all the news 
It was the first day of spring in the year of ProtagonistA's coronation , and ProtagonistB was up at the royal court to welcome ProtagonistA to the throne ; but the weather had already turned hot and dry and the first - born were already starting to be gone 
 The court was in an uproar , with many of the lords and ladies already planning to leave for their summer homes 
 ProtagonistB was one of the few who remained , and ProtagonistB was determined to make the most of it 
 ProtagonistA was crowned that day , and ProtagonistB was there to witness it 
 ProtagonistB cheered along with the rest of the court , and even managed to get a glimpse of ProtagonistA 
 However , the hot weather continued , and by the end of the week , most of the court had deserted ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was one of the few who remained , and ProtagonistB vowed to stand by ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was a great comfort to ProtagonistA during ProtagonistA's early days as ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB was always there to lend a listening ear or offer advice 
 The hot weather eventually broke , and the court returned to normal 
 ProtagonistA's reign was a long and successful one , and ProtagonistB was always there by ProtagonistA's side 
The sun was setting on the day that ProtagonistB called ProtagonistA to understand that ProtagonistA had overshot ProtagonistA's task 
 ProtagonistA 're supposed to be cleaning the windows , not the whole house 
  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB do , but ProtagonistA 've gone too far 
 ProtagonistB 'll have to ask ProtagonistA to leave 
  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry 
 ProtagonistB was always late , never had any money , and was always making excuses 
 But ProtagonistA was blinded by love , or so ProtagonistA thought 
 That was the final straw 
Once upon a time there was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was sitting in the kitchen of ProtagonistB's mother 's house , staring up at the ceiling where magnificent paintings of the gods held the key to the universe 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistB heard a noise downstairs 
 It sounded like someone was coming up the stairs 
 ProtagonistB got up quietly and went to the top of the stairs to see who it was 
 It was ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry to just show up like this , but ProtagonistA need a place to stay 
 ProtagonistA's parents kicked ProtagonistA out 
 ProtagonistB felt sorry for ProtagonistA and welcomed ProtagonistA into the house 
 ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA to a room where ProtagonistA could stay and promised to keep ProtagonistA safe 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was going to be a part of ProtagonistB's life forever 
 ProtagonistA had been caught in lies before , and ProtagonistA knew that this time , ProtagonistA would be caught again 
 ProtagonistB was the only one who could help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been caught stealing from the local grocery store 
 But ProtagonistB did n't say anything , and ProtagonistB agreed to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was relieved , and ProtagonistA was grateful to ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's help 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken , and ProtagonistA would never trust ProtagonistB again 
 At first ProtagonistA just thought of ProtagonistB as a friend , but soon ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA was in love 
 The door was shut , but a light burned within , and ProtagonistA could hear the sound of voices raised in song 
 It was a small , intimate service , and ProtagonistA felt immediately at home 
 The congregation was made up of people of all ages , from young children to elders , and they were all singing with such feeling and joy that ProtagonistA was soon caught up in the spirit of the moment and singing along with them 
 They had a pleasant conversation , and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA telling ProtagonistC about ProtagonistA's life and how ProtagonistA had come to be in ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC was a kind man , and ProtagonistC listened to ProtagonistA's story with interest 
 When ProtagonistA had finished , ProtagonistC smiled and took ProtagonistA's hand 
 Welcome , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said 
 ProtagonistC hope ProtagonistA 'll come back again 
 As ProtagonistA walked back out into the night , ProtagonistA felt warmed by the experience and the welcome ProtagonistA had received 
There was ProtagonistA 
 They talked for hours and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had finally found ProtagonistA's soulmate 
 They exchanged numbers and went their separate ways 
 A few weeks later , they met up again and this time , they got married 
 They had a beautiful wedding and they lived happily ever after 
 The road had come to a sudden end , and there was nothing but a cold , dead end ahead of ProtagonistA 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 In the center of the clearing was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was huddled in a ball , crying ProtagonistB's eyes out 
  ProtagonistA 'm here now , and ProtagonistA wo n't let anything happen to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB stopped crying and looked at ProtagonistA with gratitude 
 ProtagonistB was still weak , but ProtagonistB was able to walk on ProtagonistB's own 
 The first was a description of a dream in which ProtagonistB had been visited by an angel , who had told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistC was in heaven and that ProtagonistB would soon join ProtagonistC there 
 The second was a dream in which ProtagonistB had been transported to a beautiful garden , where ProtagonistB had been given a flower by a stranger 
 ProtagonistA's fame spread far and wide , and ProtagonistA began to attract a following of people who believed in ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's followers began to call ProtagonistA the  Queen of Dreams 
 ProtagonistA's movement continued to grow , and ProtagonistA began to gain political power 
 ProtagonistA's movement continued to grow , and ProtagonistA became one of the most influential people in England 
 ProtagonistA is remembered as one of the most important figures in English history 
 ProtagonistA had been warned by ProtagonistA's parents not to stray too far from home , for the city was a dangerous place for a young girl 
 The streets were narrower here , and the buildings seemed to lean in towards each other 
 They were laughing and jeering , and in the center of the circle was ProtagonistB , cowering on the ground 
 ProtagonistA's heart went out to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA rushed forward to help ProtagonistB 
 The boys were mocking ProtagonistB and throwing stones at ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was horrified 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with gratitude in ProtagonistB's eyes 
  Thank ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Those boys have been tormenting ProtagonistB for days 
 ProtagonistB 'm so glad ProtagonistA came along 
 The boys had seen ProtagonistA talking to ProtagonistB and were coming back to finish the job 
 ProtagonistA sent ProtagonistB a card that read : Beg for ProtagonistB's help 
 ProtagonistB was shocked and disappointed 
 ProtagonistB had hoped ProtagonistA would grow up to be a great man , but it seemed ProtagonistA was nothing more than a beggar 
 ProtagonistB was also waiting for the bus , and ProtagonistA could tell ProtagonistB was getting just as impatient as ProtagonistA was 
 Finally , the bus arrived , and they both got on 
 But as they were getting on , ProtagonistB bumped into ProtagonistA and knocked ProtagonistA down 
 Can ProtagonistB help me?Of course , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'll get ProtagonistB's crew ready and we 'll be out of here in no time 
 They parted ways , but promised to help each other again if needed 
 But the police did n't believe ProtagonistA 
 They said the evidence was all there , plain as day 
 The police did n't believe ProtagonistA 
 They said ProtagonistA was a liar 
 They said ProtagonistA was a cold - blooded killer 
 They said ProtagonistA was a monster 
 The jury did n't believe ProtagonistA 
 They said ProtagonistA was guilty 
 They said ProtagonistA was a killer 
 They said ProtagonistA was a monster 
 ProtagonistB did n't believe ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA was guilty 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA was a killer 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA was a monster 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA was a cold - blooded killer 
 ProtagonistB was the only one who ever stood up for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB was always there to help ProtagonistA out 
  Just leave ProtagonistA alone , please 
 ProtagonistA had to know who ProtagonistA could trust and who ProtagonistA could n't , what was safe and what was n't 
 ProtagonistB was lurking in the shadows , and ProtagonistB looked shifty 
 ProtagonistB was tall and thin , with a long , hooked nose 
 ProtagonistB grinned at ProtagonistA , revealing yellowed teeth 
 Yes , ProtagonistA can help ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm looking for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's name is Alice 
  What do ProtagonistB want with her?I have a message for ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  From ProtagonistA's father 
 ProtagonistA's father had been dead for years 
  ProtagonistA's father is dead 
 The man 's smile faded 
 ProtagonistB's eyes turned cold 
 I do n't have time for this ,  ProtagonistB said 
  If ProtagonistA see ProtagonistA , tell ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA's father is waiting for ProtagonistA 
 And tell ProtagonistA to come alone 
 With that , ProtagonistB turned and walked away 
 A historian , a naturalist , a sculptor , and racing horses were among them 
 The ladies standing on the hill were the only ones who were not looking at ProtagonistA 
 Are ProtagonistA okay ?  ProtagonistB asked with a worried look on ProtagonistB's face 
  ProtagonistA 'm fine , ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB nodded and went back to bed 
 ProtagonistB agreed , and they mowed the grass together 
It was a beautiful day outside , and ProtagonistA was feeling good 
 The man explained that they were going to re - enact the moment when ProtagonistB was first lodged in the Boston house 
 ProtagonistA was intrigued and decided to watch 
 The group went through the motions of the event , and ProtagonistA was impressed by their dedication 
You 're gon na eat ProtagonistA , said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA lay down on the sand , but do n't kill ProtagonistA 
 The sun was setting and the waves were crashing and ProtagonistA was getting hungry 
 ProtagonistA had been stranded on this deserted island for days now , and ProtagonistA was starting to get desperate 
 ProtagonistB was a ProtagonistA was terrified 
 ProtagonistB caught up to ProtagonistA and knocked ProtagonistA to the ground 
 I'm not going to eat ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm lost too 
 ProtagonistB 've been wandering around this island for days , looking for food 
 ProtagonistB 'm so hungry ProtagonistB ca n't think straight 
  If we work together , we 're sure to find food 
 The bear nodded in agreement 
 They found some berries and nuts , which sustained them , but they were both still very hungry 
 One day , they came across a cave 
 They went inside and found a feast ! There was fruit , bread , and even some cooked meat 
 They ate until they were stuffed and then went back outside 
 Thank ProtagonistA for teaming up with ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm glad we found food , but ProtagonistB 'm even more glad we found each other 
 When ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistA started to remember all the good times they had together and it helped ProtagonistA to feel better 
ProtagonistC died 
 ProtagonistA 'm so sorry , ProtagonistB 
 It was an accident 
 ProtagonistA 'm so sorry 
 ProtagonistA 'm so sorry 
 ProtagonistA was so shocked and appalled by it that ProtagonistA cried out ,  Wait , that 's a new plot !  ProtagonistB had outdone ProtagonistB this time , and ProtagonistA was determined to stop ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB just laughed and said that ProtagonistB loved to see the look on ProtagonistA's face when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had been outsmarted 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was just too predictable and that it was time for ProtagonistA to learn a lesson 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA , is that really ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB said , as ProtagonistB got closer 
 ProtagonistB was in the neighborhood and thought ProtagonistB 'd stop by to say hi 
 ProtagonistB 'm sorry ProtagonistB have n't been in touch , but ProtagonistB 've been really busy 
 I understand 
 But it 's so good to see you!They chatted for a while , catching up on old times 
 It was like no time had passed at all 
 I should go ,  ProtagonistB said finally 
  But it was great to see ProtagonistA 
 We should keep in touch this time 
 They said their goodbyes and ProtagonistB walked away 
 It was nice to have old friends back in ProtagonistA's life 
 Almost two years old 
 ProtagonistA's eyes widened in shock and ProtagonistA stared at ProtagonistB , wondering if ProtagonistB was awake 
 ProtagonistB , said that ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's husband were stranded in the area and were looking for a place to stay for the night 
 ProtagonistB asked if ProtagonistA knew of any farms or houses in the area that might be able to help them out 
 As they walked , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA about ProtagonistA's life and what ProtagonistA liked to do 
 ProtagonistB was very interested in everything ProtagonistA had to say 
 When they arrived at the farmhouse , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to come inside and meet ProtagonistB's husband 
 ProtagonistB was a very friendly man , and ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's wife made ProtagonistA feel right at home 
 They offered ProtagonistA a drink and some food , and ProtagonistA accepted 
 As ProtagonistA was about to leave , ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA would like to come and visit them sometime 
 ProtagonistB had been wounded in battle and ProtagonistA was taking ProtagonistB home 
 ProtagonistA was relieved to be home , but ProtagonistA was also worried about ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was standing before ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA's hair aflame 
 ProtagonistB was standing in the middle of the path , and ProtagonistB was holding a lantern 
 ProtagonistB looked like ProtagonistB was waiting for someone 
 When ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB smiled and held out ProtagonistB's hand 
  Hello , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 've been waiting for ProtagonistA 
It was a hot February day in the year 1826 , when ProtagonistA lay the body of ProtagonistB , to the sad and uncharitable 
 ProtagonistB had been struck down by a sudden illness and had died within days 
 But it was n't and now ProtagonistB was gone 
 The funeral was a small and somber affair 
 There were only a few people there to pay their respects and ProtagonistA felt so alone 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to meet ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would be able to provide ProtagonistA with a fine meal 
 ProtagonistB was very handsome and ProtagonistB's garden was exquisite 
 They had a wonderful time together and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would always remember this day 
 It was early summer and the days were long and lazy 
 ProtagonistB was tall and handsome , and ProtagonistB had a kind face 
 ProtagonistA felt drawn to ProtagonistB and they began talking 
 ProtagonistB's name was William and ProtagonistB was a gentleman 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had come to the park to find a wife 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had been looking for a young lady who was beautiful , intelligent , and kind 
 When ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB had found ProtagonistB's perfect match 
 They began courting and soon they were married 
 They were very happy together and they had a beautiful life 
 Inside were eleven miniature people , each no bigger than ProtagonistA's thumb 
 They were all fast asleep 
 ProtagonistB stirred and opened ProtagonistB's eyes 
 ProtagonistB was no bigger than a grain of rice 
 Seeing ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB let out a cry of alarm and scrambled to hide behind a blade of grass 
 The other ten woke up and followed suit 
 After a few minutes , they seemed to have calmed down and began to explore their new surroundings 
 These little people were so full of life and curiosity 
 So , when ProtagonistA's mother took ProtagonistA to dinner and asked ProtagonistA whether ProtagonistA would like a dog , ProtagonistA was ecstatic 
 ProtagonistA immediately said yes and they went to pick out ProtagonistB that very night 
 ProtagonistB was the perfect dog and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly 
Two weeks ago , in the town on the Mississippi , there lived ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's name was John , and ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's wife 
 They had been married for ten years , and they had two children 
 They were both happy with their life , but they both wanted something more 
 ProtagonistB was shocked , and ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to think about it for a week 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB did not want to make any decisions right away 
 ProtagonistB was heartbroken , but ProtagonistB knew that there was nothing ProtagonistB could do 
 ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA ProtagonistA's divorce papers , and ProtagonistB watched ProtagonistA leave ProtagonistB's life 
 ProtagonistB was sad , but ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB had to move on 
 ProtagonistB stared back at ProtagonistA and then ProtagonistB smiled 
 I'm John ,  ProtagonistB replied 
 ProtagonistB watches ProtagonistA for a few moments before clearing ProtagonistB's throat to get ProtagonistA's attention 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistB 
 It 's okay , ProtagonistA 
 Just do n't stay up here by ProtagonistA too long , okay?I wo n't , ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA promise 
 ProtagonistA is so absorbed in the story that ProtagonistA does not hear ProtagonistA's father come in a few minutes later 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA were up here reading by ProtagonistA 
 Is everything okay?Alice looks up at ProtagonistA's father , a little sheepish 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , dad

  ProtagonistA 'm reading , obviously 
 What does it look like ProtagonistA 'm doing?Well , I do n't know 
 I just thought maybe ProtagonistA were feeling lonely or something 
 I'm not lonely , ProtagonistA 'm reading 
 Now go away and leave ProtagonistA alone 
 I came to see ProtagonistA , obviously 
 What are ProtagonistA doing sitting in here by ProtagonistA reading?I'm not by ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 'm with you now 
 Well , I 'm glad I came then 
 I was starting to worry about ProtagonistA

 Okay , well , I 'll let ProtagonistA get back to ProtagonistA's book then 
 I just wanted to make sure ProtagonistA were okay

 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA were up here reading by ProtagonistA

 Just one more chapter and then ProtagonistA need to go to bed 
ProtagonistA was called ' calypso , ' and was carried away in the arms of ProtagonistB ; but perhaps like a god , the same kind of god , as the sun and the moon and the stars and the whole galaxy 
 ProtagonistB was also blue - eyed , brown - haired , and red - eyed , with a florid face 
 But ProtagonistB was not exactly an angel ; ProtagonistB was more like a god 
 The two of them were carried away in each other 's arms , and they were both called ' calypso 
There 's ProtagonistA , and if ProtagonistB follow ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB should catch ProtagonistA , said ProtagonistB , but seemed not to be very careful 
 ProtagonistB was driving too fast and not paying attention to the road 
 As a result , ProtagonistB hit ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's car 
 ProtagonistA was knocked unconscious and taken to the hospital 
 ProtagonistB was arrested and charged with vehicular assault 
 ProtagonistA was born in the year of the dragon and was said to be very wise 
 One day , a group of children came to ProtagonistA's house and asked ProtagonistA to tell them a story 
  The children were very interested in this story and asked ProtagonistA to tell them more 
 ProtagonistB was very kind and always helped others 
 One day , ProtagonistB met a man who was also very beautiful 
 They fell in love and got married 
 They had two children , a boy and a girl 
 Unfortunately , ProtagonistB's husband died young 
 ProtagonistB was very sad , but ProtagonistB continued to live in the palace and take care of ProtagonistB's children 
 One day , ProtagonistB met a man who was also very beautiful

 They had two children , a boy and a girl 
 Unfortunately , ProtagonistB's husband died young 
 ProtagonistB was very sad , but ProtagonistB continued to live in the palace and take care of ProtagonistB's children 
ProtagonistA was born in a small village in China 
 ProtagonistA's father was a farmer and ProtagonistB was a stay - at - home wife 
 When ProtagonistA was five , ProtagonistA's father died of a sudden illness and ProtagonistB was left to raise ProtagonistA alone 
 ProtagonistB did the best ProtagonistB could , but ProtagonistB was poor and could not afford to send ProtagonistA to school 
 When ProtagonistA was eight , ProtagonistB died of a heart attack and ProtagonistA was sent to a Chinese orphanage 
 At the orphanage , ProtagonistA was treated well and ProtagonistA soon made friends with the other children 
 When ProtagonistA was sixteen , the orphanage was closed down and ProtagonistA was forced to leave 
 The villagers were kind and welcomed ProtagonistA with open arms 
In those days , no man had any serious business to do with ProtagonistA , but , for some odd reason , at the age of eighteen ProtagonistA seemed to have gained much more importance than in any other part of ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistB , took the time to listen to ProtagonistA's problems and give ProtagonistA's advice 
 ProtagonistA was accustomed to be the last one to board the little white train at the west end of the Bronx , or at least to begin ProtagonistA's journey without any companion except a stranger who looked and spoke like ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was also boarding the train 
 As it turned out , ProtagonistB was also the daughter of a market girl and an explorer 
 ProtagonistB's name was Lily 
 The two girls talked all the way to the end of the line , and when they parted ways , they promised to keep in touch 
 They wrote to each other often , sharing stories of their lives 
 They both dreamed of the day when they would explore the world together 
 One day , their dreams came true 
 ProtagonistB came to visit ProtagonistA in Brooklyn and the two of them set off on the adventure of a lifetime 
 They saw all the sights that the world had to offer and their bond only grew stronger 
 They say that true friendship is rare 
 They remain friends to this day , exploring the world and their own lives , always learning new things about each other and themselves 
 ProtagonistB was charming and handsome , and ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA feel special 
 However , unbeknownst to ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB was actually a vampire 
 ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA for some time , and ProtagonistB had been waiting for the perfect moment to strike 
 When ProtagonistA was alone with ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB finally revealed ProtagonistB's true nature 
 ProtagonistB attacked ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was helpless to resist 
ProtagonistA was raised in a secluded compound by ProtagonistC and a group of other men 
 ProtagonistA was never allowed to leave and never saw any other women 
 ProtagonistB was the first man ProtagonistA had ever seen and ProtagonistA was instantly fascinated by ProtagonistB 
 They began to meet secretly and ProtagonistA soon fell in love with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC found out and was furious 
 ProtagonistC forbade ProtagonistA from seeing ProtagonistB again and locked ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's room 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
ProtagonistA's life changed the day ProtagonistB died 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 But then something strange happened 
 ProtagonistB , was always the more level - headed one , and ProtagonistB always tried to keep ProtagonistA in check 
 It was a hard road , but with ProtagonistB's help , ProtagonistA eventually found true happiness from within 
 Hi , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA walking home and ProtagonistB just wanted to make sure ProtagonistA 're okay 
 ProtagonistB listened and then gave ProtagonistA some advice 
 I'm sure ProtagonistC did n't mean to hurt ProtagonistA's feelings ,  ProtagonistB said 
 Now everything was back to normal between them 
In the year 1358 , during the reign of King Edward the First , was born ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was a good man , but ProtagonistB was also a very proud one 
 ProtagonistB did not like it when ProtagonistA spoke ProtagonistA's mind , and ProtagonistB often told ProtagonistA to be quiet 
 This made ProtagonistA very angry , and ProtagonistA would often argue with ProtagonistB 
 One day , ProtagonistB was away on business , and ProtagonistA was left at home with ProtagonistA's two children 
 ProtagonistB was not happy when ProtagonistB found out that ProtagonistA had been talking to peasants 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was not to associate with them anymore , and ProtagonistB forbade ProtagonistA from going near them 
 This made ProtagonistA very angry , and ProtagonistA decided to defy ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was furious when ProtagonistB found out what ProtagonistA was doing 
 ProtagonistB demanded that ProtagonistA stop , but ProtagonistA refused 
 ProtagonistB then threatened to divorce ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA still refused 
 Finally , ProtagonistB made good on ProtagonistB's threat , and ProtagonistB divorced ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's story is an inspirational one , and it shows that it is never too late to learn 
 It 's a pity to see ProtagonistA's head , ProtagonistA's wife , all throbbing and squirmy , ProtagonistA's eyes so half - closed ,  said ProtagonistB in ProtagonistB's sweetest voice 
  ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA not to drink so much wine , but ProtagonistA would n't listen to ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistA's head was indeed throbbing and squirmy , and ProtagonistA's eyes were only half - open 
  ProtagonistA 'm so sorry , ProtagonistA's love ,  ProtagonistA said finally 
  Please forgive ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head and walked away , leaving ProtagonistA alone with ProtagonistA's throbbing head and squirming stomach 
 It had been two years since ProtagonistB's death , and ProtagonistA felt it was time to tell their story 
In truth , for all the things ProtagonistA had , no one expected ProtagonistA to be a mother 
 But when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , everything changed 
The air in the room in which ProtagonistA , before every other girl in ProtagonistA's family , had been married , was of a clear , clear water , free from the mists of the night 
 It was a room that had been in ProtagonistA's family for generations , and it was said that the air in that room had the power to bring good luck to those who were married in it 
 This was ProtagonistA's home , and this was where ProtagonistA belonged 
 They ended up becoming good friends and would often talk and hang out together 
 It turns out , ProtagonistB felt the same way about ProtagonistA and they ended up dating 
 They 've been together for five years now and are very happy 
 To ProtagonistA , they were all the same 
 I'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but there is no one here 
 The parish has been closed down 
 ProtagonistA was confused 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could come and live with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistB was huge ! ProtagonistB's muscles rippled under ProtagonistB's skin , and ProtagonistB's eyes burned with a fierce intensity 
 ProtagonistB was like a lion who had been tamed , and ProtagonistA felt safe in ProtagonistB's presence 
 They stared at each other for a long moment , and then ProtagonistB spoke 
 ProtagonistB have been waiting for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistA would come 
 ProtagonistB voice was like thunder , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's knees tremble 
 ProtagonistB am the Guardian of this place 
 It is ProtagonistB's duty to protect those who enter 
 And why do ProtagonistB need to protect me?Because ProtagonistA are special , ProtagonistA 
 Come , sit down and rest 
 ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA to a nearby tree and ProtagonistA sat down 
 ProtagonistB sat down next to ProtagonistA and they looked at each other for a long time 
 Thank ProtagonistB for protecting ProtagonistA 
 And so it was 
 ProtagonistB was found dead in ProtagonistB's bed , with ProtagonistB's eyes wide open and a look of terror on ProtagonistB's face 
 It is said that ProtagonistA knew what would happen , and ProtagonistA tried to warn ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB would not listen 
There was once ProtagonistA 
It was about that day that ProtagonistA finally said goodbye to ProtagonistB and child 
 ProtagonistA had packed ProtagonistA's bags and made all the arrangements , and now all ProtagonistA had to do was say the words 
 ProtagonistA 'm taking the child with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was stunned 
 ProtagonistB could n't believe that ProtagonistA was really doing this 
 ProtagonistB begged ProtagonistA to stay , but ProtagonistA was resolute 
 It was a difficult decision , but ProtagonistA knew it was the right thing to do 
 ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with big , blue eyes and ProtagonistA felt a sudden surge of maternal instinct 
 They named ProtagonistB Stripes and ProtagonistB quickly became a part of the family 
 ProtagonistB looked so much like ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA's husband often joked that ProtagonistB was really ProtagonistA's son 
 As ProtagonistB grew , ProtagonistB began to look more and more like a man 
 By the time ProtagonistB was five inches tall , ProtagonistB looked exactly like ProtagonistA's husband 
 This caused some tension in the family , but they all loved ProtagonistB and accepted ProtagonistB as one of their own 
 One day , when ProtagonistB was five inches long , ProtagonistB ran away from home 
 They always wondered what happened to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 's been in every picture book , every movie , and every TV show 
 We all know ProtagonistA's story by heart 
 But how did ProtagonistA come to be?No one knows for sure , but the most popular theory is that ProtagonistA was created by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was a mathematician and a writer , and ProtagonistB was fascinated by children 
 ProtagonistB would often take them on boat rides and tell them stories 
 One day , ProtagonistB told a story about ProtagonistA 
 The children loved it so much that they begged ProtagonistB to write it down 
 And so ProtagonistB did 
 The picture of ProtagonistA that we all know and love was drawn by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB wanted to make sure that ProtagonistA looked exactly like the children ProtagonistB had told the story to 
 It was better for ProtagonistB to die now , before it was too late 
ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's early twenty - first year , had , in fact , the least to do , of all ProtagonistB's ladies of ProtagonistA's age , in the establishment of a palace for them at the point where the river Styx flows into the Thrym - yard 
 The other ladies , all older and more experienced , took charge of the construction , while ProtagonistA was given the task of supervising the servants and making sure the palace ran smoothly 
 It was struggling against the current , and ProtagonistA could see that it was exhausted 
 The fish was so grateful to ProtagonistA for saving its life , and it soon became clear that it had magical powers 
 It granted ProtagonistA three wishes , and ProtagonistA used them wisely 
 The fish 's magical powers had transformed the palace into a beautiful and luxurious home , and ProtagonistA was proud to have played a part in it 
 One day , while out walking along the shore , ProtagonistA came across a dead body 
 The body was that of ProtagonistB 
 There was a note next to the body that said  ProtagonistB 'm sorry  
 So when ProtagonistA was accepted into a prestigious boarding school , they were over the moon 
 ProtagonistA was gifted with a special ability - ProtagonistA could see into the future 
 It was a beautiful day , and they were enjoying the view of the skyline 
 ProtagonistB commented on how lucky ProtagonistA was to live in such a beautiful city 
 ProtagonistB sympathized , but said that ProtagonistB thought the city was exciting and full of opportunity 
 ProtagonistB had never known what to do with that face , how to protect ProtagonistA from the dangers that it seemed to attract 
 And so ProtagonistB had always been on ProtagonistB's guard , never letting ProtagonistA out of ProtagonistB's sight for a moment , and never letting ProtagonistA out of the house after dark 
 But now , ProtagonistA was grown up , and ProtagonistB was no longer with ProtagonistA 
 The darkness did n't consume ProtagonistA , and the monsters did n't come to get ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistB had not expected to find ProtagonistA dead 
 ProtagonistB had been walking in the woods , looking for mushrooms , when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA's body lying on the ground 
 ProtagonistA was lying on ProtagonistA's back , ProtagonistA's eyes open and staring up at the sky 
 There was no blood , no signs of violence 
 It looked as if ProtagonistA had simply lain down and died 
 ProtagonistB called the police and then sat down to wait 
 ProtagonistB was in shock , and it was n't until the police arrived that ProtagonistB realized ProtagonistB had been crying 
 ProtagonistB was everything ProtagonistA had ever wanted in a man , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be faithful to ProtagonistA 
 They got married and moved to a small town in the middle of nowhere 
 It was perfect 
 They had a beautiful house and a wonderful life 
 Everything was perfect , until ProtagonistB started cheating on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
The night ProtagonistA vanished was the night when ProtagonistA shared ProtagonistA's bed with ProtagonistB 
 It was also the night when ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistB was a vampire 
 When ProtagonistA confronted ProtagonistB about it , ProtagonistB did n't deny it 
 In fact , ProtagonistB seemed almost proud of it 
 That 's when ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get away from ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 's never looked back since 
 It was a cold day and ProtagonistA was bundled up in ProtagonistA's coat , scarf , and gloves 
 ProtagonistB , was trying to build a snowman but was having trouble 
 That was the last time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 Even when ProtagonistB was no longer a little girl ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB would still come to visit ProtagonistA and help ProtagonistA build the snowman 
 And every year , they would give each other a big hug 
 I was very happy for ProtagonistB and I knew that ProtagonistB would be able to get a good education at the college 
 It was a small shadow , about the size of a mouse , and it had a curious look on its face 
 The shadow seemed to be looking around the kitchen , as if it were looking for something 
 After a few minutes , it got up from the table and started to explore the rest of the room 
 It sounded like something was knocking over furniture 
 The shadow turned to look at ProtagonistA and then ran out the door 
 ProtagonistA lost sight of it and it was gone 
 ProtagonistA was bewildered by what had just happened 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm home !  ProtagonistB called out 
 Maybe it was just a strange coincidence and ProtagonistA would never see it again 
ProtagonistA's husband had died eight days ago , and ProtagonistA was still in mourning 
 Belvedere of the Parisian street fly - and - supplies , Dr
 John Quartermaster - of - the - ship - whale Squadron Heterozone of the Navy , and indeed the world - famous spectacles - in - the - air 
 ProtagonistC shouted at ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC am coming to murder ProtagonistA ! Go away , ProtagonistA was terrified 
 When they arrived , they found ProtagonistC still outside , ranting and raving 
 They took ProtagonistC away and ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief 
 ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as Harry and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would be ProtagonistA's friend 
 From that day forward , ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA laugh when ProtagonistA was feeling down and helped ProtagonistA adjust to ProtagonistA's new life 
ProtagonistA was getting fed up with ProtagonistB constantly calling ProtagonistA  Madam 
 ' It makes ProtagonistA feel like an old lady 
 ProtagonistA aunt was taken aback at first , but then ProtagonistB realized how ProtagonistA must feel 
 Of course , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB 'm sorry if ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA feel uncomfortable 
 ProtagonistB 'll try to remember to call ProtagonistA by ProtagonistA's name from now on 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was a writer and that ProtagonistB was working on ProtagonistB's latest novel 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA was a writer too , and ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that if ProtagonistA wanted to be a writer , ProtagonistA should just start writing 
 It was that simple 
 ProtagonistB wanted to know more about ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB was determined to find out 
 ProtagonistB would do whatever it took to get to know ProtagonistA better 
It was a warm day in early June when ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB said their vows 
 They were surrounded by their closest family and friends , all of whom were beaming with happiness 
 It was a perfect day 
 The cause of death was a complication of pregnancy - something that no one could have predicted or prevented 
 ProtagonistA had only been married for a short time , but in that time ProtagonistA had been incredibly happy 
 ProtagonistA's death came as a shock to everyone who knew ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was devastated 
 ProtagonistB could n't believe that ProtagonistA was gone , and that ProtagonistB would never see ProtagonistA again 
 The pain was unbearable 
 ProtagonistA's family and friends were also grieving 
 They could n't believe that ProtagonistA was gone so soon 
 It was a tragic event , but everyone who loved ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never be forgotten 
ProtagonistA was born in a house where the gods took their name from ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistC from the earth 
 It was a happy home , full of laughter and love 
 But when ProtagonistA's father died , everything changed 
 ProtagonistB became a bitter woman , and ProtagonistB began to take ProtagonistB's anger out on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB would beat ProtagonistA and call ProtagonistA's names , making ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistA was nothing 
 So ProtagonistA held onto ProtagonistA's memories of ProtagonistA's happy childhood , and ProtagonistA used them to keep ProtagonistA going 
 ProtagonistA was relieved to have made it this far , but ProtagonistA's journey was far from over 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistB yell after ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's only companions were the books ProtagonistA read and the animals ProtagonistA cared for 
 One day , however , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA's door , begging for help 
 They were married a year later , and lived happily ever after 
 ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA and waved back , looking exhausted but happy 
 ProtagonistB brought the horses to a stop and jumped down , giving ProtagonistA a big hug 
  ProtagonistB 'm so glad to see ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 've been thinking about ProtagonistA all day 
 But ProtagonistB loved them 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was cleaning the cages , one of the rooks escaped 
 ProtagonistB was not happy when ProtagonistA found out about the escaped bird 
 But ProtagonistB said ,  It is what it is 
 And it 's what ProtagonistA get for not taking care of them properly 
 It was a strange turn of events , but in the end , ProtagonistA learned to love the birds as much as ProtagonistB did 
 It was an accident , of course 
 Just a girl with a few tricks up ProtagonistA's sleeve 
ProtagonistA was born to a wealthy family in the city of Paris on the morning of the 19th of February , 1612 
 ProtagonistA's parents named ProtagonistA's Alice after ProtagonistA's maternal grandmother 
 They were very much in love and had a beautiful wedding 
 They were very happy there and had two wonderful children together 
 Sadly , ProtagonistA's idyllic life was cut short when ProtagonistA contracted a deadly illness and passed away at the age of thirty - two 
 ProtagonistB and children were devastated by ProtagonistA's untimely death 
 ProtagonistA will be forever missed by those who loved ProtagonistA 
It was early morning on the fifth of July , and ProtagonistC was out walking along the banks of the Thames with several other people 
 They were in the vicinity of a house called the Mulhouse , which belonged to ProtagonistA 
 As they walked , they talked and laughed together , enjoying the beautiful morning 
 The sun was just starting to peek over the horizon , and the birds were singing in the trees 
 It was a peaceful and happy time 
 Suddenly , they heard a loud noise coming from the Mulhouse 
 It sounded like someone was crying or screaming inside 
 They all stopped and looked at each other , wondering what to do 
 ProtagonistC decided to investigate 
 ProtagonistC walked up to the house and knocked on the door 
 When no one answered , ProtagonistC cautiously opened it and peeked inside 
 What ProtagonistC saw was ProtagonistB , lying on the floor in a pool of blood 
 It was clear that ProtagonistB had been brutally murdered 
 ProtagonistC immediately ran back to the others and told them what ProtagonistC had seen 
 They all agreed that they should go to the authorities and report what they had found 
 The police arrived soon after and began to investigate the scene 
 It was a tragic event , but thanks to the quick thinking of ProtagonistC , justice was eventually served 
 It was a bittersweet moment for ProtagonistA 
 They had been packing all day and were both exhausted 
 ProtagonistB's trunk was especially heavy 
 The sun was streaming in through the windows and the air was thick and heavy 
 Suddenly , the door to the dining - room opened and in walked ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was carrying a large tray of food , which ProtagonistB placed in the middle of the table 
 ProtagonistB then went over to the windows and began to open them , letting in a much - needed breeze 
 There , that 's better ,  ProtagonistB said 
  It was getting a bit stuffy in here 
I am a man of thirty - nine years , and a thousand and one years ago at the beginning of the twelfth century ProtagonistA , appeared in the court of ProtagonistB , and ordered the execution of four hundred and fifty - two religious and political persons 
 ProtagonistA's skin was pale and flawless 
 ProtagonistA was brought before ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB demanded to know who ProtagonistA was and what ProtagonistA was doing there 
 ProtagonistB was not a man who tolerated dissent or threats 
 ProtagonistB ordered ProtagonistA to be executed immediately 
 ProtagonistA was brought to the executioner 's block and ProtagonistA's head was severed from ProtagonistA's body 
 They had come to conquer ProtagonistA's village , and ProtagonistA knew that they would kill ProtagonistA if they found ProtagonistA 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was running towards ProtagonistA , calling out to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB scooped ProtagonistA up in ProtagonistB's arms and ran back towards the village 
 The Lōkampans were close behind them , but they managed to make it to safety 
 And they were both good women , and they were both honest , and they were both wise 
 And they loved each other dearly 
 And they had ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB's name was Cain 
 And ProtagonistB was a good man , and ProtagonistB was honest , and ProtagonistB was wise 
  Well , ProtagonistA , it 's a bit complicated ,  ProtagonistB replied 
  But ProtagonistB 'll try to explain it to ProtagonistA 
   The world is round , and it spins on its axis ,  ProtagonistB began 
  The sun is what gives us day and night , and the moon is what causes the tides 
  Yes , it is ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But there 's still more to learn 
ProtagonistB had always said that the best way to get information out of ProtagonistA in the future was not to kill ProtagonistA , but to expose ProtagonistA , to the light of ridicule 
 So , when the time came , ProtagonistB did just that 
 ProtagonistB called a press conference and announced that ProtagonistA , had been having an affair with one of ProtagonistA's students 
 The media had a field day with the story , and ProtagonistA was soon laughed out of ProtagonistA's job 
 ProtagonistB felt that ProtagonistB had finally gotten the information ProtagonistB needed out of ProtagonistA 
In the summer of that year , 1577 , ProtagonistA , wrote a letter to the Golden Bough , in the neighbourhood of Jermyn , in Yorkshire , where ProtagonistA then was living , in which ProtagonistA says:I have been thinking much about you of late , dear Bough , and wondering how you are getting on 
 ProtagonistB is a very remarkable woman , and ProtagonistA am sure you will be as impressed as ProtagonistA was by ProtagonistB's intelligence and ProtagonistB's energy 
 ProtagonistA 
Frank Wilson , an old friend and colleague of ProtagonistA's , once said ,  ProtagonistB am afraid , ProtagonistA , that when ProtagonistC is doing a little bit of necessary thing , you know all about it , and ProtagonistA 's got all sorts of things on ProtagonistA's conscience , but when ProtagonistA is doing all sorts of unnecessary thing , you never know what 's going on , you just know you 're used to it , and it 's when you 're doing a great deal of unnecessary thing that you really get into trouble 
 ProtagonistB could n't help but admire ProtagonistA for it , even if ProtagonistB did n't always understand ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistC was in trouble and needed help , but ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
  ProtagonistC is in trouble and ProtagonistA do n't know how to help ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB thought for a moment and then said ,  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 're a smart woman 
 ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA 'll figure it out 
Siskais will not have noticed that the very day when ProtagonistA was to enrol in ProtagonistA's first year of school , ProtagonistB had ProtagonistA sent to the London School of Economics 
 It was only when ProtagonistB received a letter from the school informing ProtagonistB of ProtagonistA's enrolment that ProtagonistB realised what had happened 
 Although ProtagonistB was disappointed that ProtagonistB would not be able to see ProtagonistA starting school , ProtagonistB was happy that ProtagonistA would be getting a good education 
 ProtagonistB was sure that ProtagonistA would make the most of ProtagonistA's opportunities and make something of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was different because ProtagonistB had died several times and had killed children 
 As time went on , ProtagonistB started to change 
 ProtagonistB became more and more violent 
 ProtagonistB would kill animals and then children 
 One day , ProtagonistB went too far 
 ProtagonistB killed a lot of people in ProtagonistA's town 
 It was the only way to save the world from ProtagonistB's violence 
 But then ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA some of the things ProtagonistB could do and ProtagonistA was convinced 
 It was one of ProtagonistA's favorite times of day 
 ProtagonistB loved to watch ProtagonistA in action 
 One day , ProtagonistB decided to take a turn at hosting tea time 
 ProtagonistB sent for the servants and lay down on the front steps of the Black family house 
 ProtagonistB was determined to show ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB could be just as graceful and elegant as ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA was impressed with ProtagonistB's performance 
 ProtagonistB had successfully managed to host tea time just like ProtagonistA 
 From then on , tea time was always a special time for the two of them to share 
One day , when ProtagonistB was 13 and ProtagonistA was only five , their mother took them to see the ancient statue of the Roman emperor Antonius 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated by the statue and asked ProtagonistA's mother a lot of questions about it 
 ProtagonistB , on the other hand , was not interested in the statue at all 
 ProtagonistB thought it was boring and wished they had gone to see something else 
 ProtagonistA had been married for fifteen years , and ProtagonistA had two children 
 ProtagonistB was a stay - at - home dad , and ProtagonistA's children were both in school 
 ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistB would make dinner for once ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB know ProtagonistA 're tired after work 
 ProtagonistA was touched by ProtagonistB's gesture , and they enjoyed a nice dinner together 
 Afterward , they went into the living room and sat down to watch TV 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB have something to tell ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
 I'm leaving ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'm in love with someone else , and ProtagonistB 'm moving out 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistB packed ProtagonistB's bags and left , and ProtagonistA was left alone with ProtagonistA's two children 
 It was hard , but ProtagonistA got through it 
The air grew still as ProtagonistA entered the main door of the old office , but ProtagonistA was ready 
 ProtagonistB hesitated for a moment before pointing ProtagonistA in the right direction 
 ProtagonistC was sitting behind a large desk , and ProtagonistC did not look happy 
  ProtagonistC leaned back in ProtagonistC's chair and looked at ProtagonistA for a long moment 
 Finally , ProtagonistC spoke 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC 'm sorry , but we 've decided to go with someone else for the position 
 ProtagonistC hesitated for a moment before answering 
  It 's just not a good fit ,  ProtagonistC said 
  ProtagonistC 'm sorry 
 ProtagonistA was paid very little , and was always given the most difficult and dangerous tasks to do 
 ProtagonistA was constantly being put in harm 's way , and ProtagonistA was tired of it 
 ProtagonistB's smile faded and ProtagonistB said they were just talking 
 ProtagonistA's mother looked at ProtagonistA suspiciously and said ProtagonistA should go to ProtagonistA's room 
As the story of the life of ProtagonistA begins , we should recall that ProtagonistB , is dead 
 It is interesting to think about how different our lives would be if ProtagonistB had not written about ProtagonistA 
 Perhaps we would never have known ProtagonistA at all 
 In any case , it is clear that ProtagonistB had a great influence on the life of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was crying and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC was possessed by a demon 
 The demon was torturing ProtagonistC and ProtagonistC was begging for mercy 
 It started to attack ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA kept praying 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistC was free from the demon 's grasp and the house was filled with light 
 It was like ProtagonistA was looking for a fight 
 ProtagonistB was just trying to do ProtagonistB's job , but ProtagonistA made it very difficult 
 ProtagonistB did n't know why ProtagonistA had to be so difficult , but ProtagonistA always was 
 A cake that ProtagonistB had specifically asked ProtagonistA not to make 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA would make it anyway , just to spite ProtagonistB 
 Frosting that ProtagonistB knew was poisoned 
 ProtagonistB tried to stop ProtagonistA from eating it , but ProtagonistA just glared at ProtagonistB and took a big bite 
It was around eleven o'clock and it had been almost two months since ProtagonistB had died 
 Three , in fact , if you include the time ProtagonistA 'd spent in temporary hospital and the time of great pain and suffering ProtagonistA 'd been through 
 It was hard for ProtagonistA to take care of ProtagonistA's sister and do everything ProtagonistB had done , but ProtagonistA managed 
 ProtagonistA cooked and cleaned and made sure ProtagonistA's sister was taken care of 
 It was a lot of work , but ProtagonistA did n't mind 
 Suddenly , the door opened and ProtagonistB walked in 
 ProtagonistB was tired and frail , but ProtagonistB was alive 
 They hugged each other tightly and cried tears of joy 
 ProtagonistB was back and everything was going to be alright 
 ProtagonistB then showed ProtagonistA how to escape from the prison 
 ProtagonistA's childhood was poor , however , and ProtagonistA never had the opportunity to learn magic 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA under ProtagonistB's wing and taught ProtagonistA everything ProtagonistA needed to know about magic 
 Now , ProtagonistA is a wizard ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA uses ProtagonistA's powers to help others 
 This led ProtagonistA into many scrapes , from which ProtagonistA was not always easily extricated 
 ProtagonistA was telling them about the time ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB and how ProtagonistB had charmed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's wife and son were both skeptical , but ProtagonistA was adamant that ProtagonistB was a great guy 
It is to the great credit of ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA is now living 
 ProtagonistB sat down in a carriage and stared out of the window , not moving as the train began to pull away from the platform 
 ProtagonistB followed ProtagonistA into an alleyway and grabbed ProtagonistA from behind , gagging ProtagonistA with a dirty rag 
 ProtagonistB then proceeded to strip ProtagonistA of ProtagonistA's clothes , leaving ProtagonistA naked and vulnerable 
 ProtagonistB then took out a knife and began to stab ProtagonistA repeatedly 
There was once an old farmer in Oxfordshire , now dead and gone , who had lived long enough to see the day when playthings had their proper uses — when industry , rather than mere wit , was the proper measure of man 's worth ; when the frivolous avocations of childish boys , once well nigh spent , had in their turn given place to the occupations which distinguished the most respectable members of society ; when the good sense of the courts of law had been fairly given due regard , so that many of those cases in which society had once regarded as frivolous or trivial — and this was for the most part , indeed , the case , in which the good sense of the law had not in any way sufficed , but which were , or at any rate were , fairly decided by an inexperienced judge , who was , or rather was , permitted to decide them , according to the rules of the game — such were the days of ProtagonistA , when , as ProtagonistA was often apt to say ,   it was a game of chance , ye good folk   ( ProtagonistA was well aware that what ProtagonistA was about to say was absolutely true)—and it was a game of chance , as well as a game of chance ; for , when ProtagonistB is in possession of a fortune , it is very seldom that ProtagonistB finds ProtagonistB in possession of nothing but ProtagonistB's own mind and the power of ProtagonistB's imagination ; but as a matter of fact , it is most often the case that ProtagonistB finds ProtagonistB in possession of a fortune , not only owing to circumstances of fortune , but owing to the power of ProtagonistB's imagination 
Hush , ProtagonistB , said the gleam in ProtagonistA's eyes as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB run barefoot through the streets of London 
 It was ProtagonistB's first time in the city and ProtagonistB was determined to make the most of it 
 ProtagonistB had always been a free spirit , and this was ProtagonistB's chance to really let loose 
 ProtagonistA was right to be worried ; ProtagonistB did n't know the city like ProtagonistA did and ProtagonistB soon found ProtagonistB in a dark alleyway , alone and vulnerable 
 Thankfully , ProtagonistA was there to rescue ProtagonistB and they ran off into the night , laughing and carefree 
 ProtagonistA loved rainy days ; they always made ProtagonistA feel so cozy and safe inside 
 As ProtagonistA waited for the kettle to boil , ProtagonistA's eyes fell on the old family photo album that was sitting on the counter 
 There were pictures of ProtagonistA's parents when they were young , pictures of ProtagonistA as a baby , and even a few pictures of ProtagonistA's grandparents 
 ProtagonistA was so lost in thought that ProtagonistA did n't even hear the front door open 
 It was n't until ProtagonistA heard footsteps in the hallway that ProtagonistA realized someone was there 
 To ProtagonistA's relief , it was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB sat down at the table with ProtagonistA and they began to chat 
 It was nice to have someone to talk to 
 After a while , the rain outside began to let up and the sun started to peek out from behind the clouds 
 Do ProtagonistA want to go for a walk ?  ProtagonistB asked 
 Maybe today was n't going to be so bad after all 
 It was always a shock when ProtagonistA woke up , disoriented and confused 
 And at the head of the table was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistB's voice soft and gentle 
  Welcome back 
It is the duty of ProtagonistA to help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB is always grateful for ProtagonistA's help , and ProtagonistB knows that ProtagonistB would not be able to survive without ProtagonistA 
 The river was dark and foreboding , and the house seemed to be abandoned 
 The house was dark and musty , and it seemed to be empty 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA with terror in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 ProtagonistB was obviously terrified , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
  That was a very good story ,  the voice said 
  But I have a better one to tell 
 The voice belonged to a beautiful woman who began to tell ProtagonistA a story about a kingdom that was in danger 
 The kingdom was being threatened by a dragon , and the only way to save it was for ProtagonistB to slay the dragon 
 But ProtagonistB was not brave at all , and ProtagonistB was sure ProtagonistB would die 
 The night before the battle , ProtagonistB prayed to ProtagonistC for help 
 ProtagonistB promised that if ProtagonistB survived , ProtagonistB would give ProtagonistB's life to ProtagonistC 
 The next day , ProtagonistB went into battle and surprisingly , ProtagonistB won 
 ProtagonistB kept ProtagonistB's promise and became a monk 
As ProtagonistA sat in ProtagonistA's study at Hogwarts , thinking , ProtagonistB was staring at ProtagonistA with a look of wonder and admiration that rivaled any other eye in the world 
 It was always reserved for someone else 
 ProtagonistB finally broke the silence by asking ProtagonistA's name 
 They began to talk and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA opening up to ProtagonistB in a way ProtagonistA never had with anyone before 
 ProtagonistB was easy to talk to and seemed to understand ProtagonistA in a way no one else ever had 
 ProtagonistB felt it too and before long , they were sharing their first kiss 
ProtagonistA was born on a dark and stormy night 
 ProtagonistA's mother died in a car crash when ProtagonistA was just a few hours old 
 ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB did n't believe in magic or anything that could n't be explained by science 
 So , when ProtagonistA started to show signs of magical ability , ProtagonistB was very skeptical 
 ProtagonistB tried to ignore it and hope it would go away , but it only got stronger 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB had to face the fact that ProtagonistA was a witch 
 ProtagonistB was scared at first , but ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA and wanted to protect ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB did some research and found a group of witches who could help teach ProtagonistA how to control ProtagonistA's powers 
 They became like a second family to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA learned so much from them 
When ProtagonistA was brought up , ProtagonistA was raised in a house of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was an angel who came down from heaven to plead with ProtagonistA 
 For of all the saints of the Gentiles , the most holy , and the most blessed , the greatest was ProtagonistA 
 And yet , though raised unto heaven and set up as a star of justice , yet ProtagonistA was esteemed in the sight of ProtagonistB , not by ProtagonistA's own merit , but for the work that ProtagonistA had done 
 Neither was ProtagonistA despised in the sight of ProtagonistB : but ProtagonistA was exalted above all things , and was received with the most great privileges , even of ProtagonistB 
 And it came to pass , that ProtagonistA was esteemed a star , by one of the angels of ProtagonistB ; but before ProtagonistA was even named , ProtagonistA was already a star , and could alone be distinguished from all others 
 The sky was a deep blue , and the mountains in the distance were a white 
 ProtagonistB was going to drive ProtagonistA's home 
 ProtagonistB took a step forward and ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was a man 
 ProtagonistB was wearing a black hoodie and ProtagonistA could n't see ProtagonistB's face 
 ProtagonistB took another step towards ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA scrambled out of the bed , running towards the door 
 But instead of attacking ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB simply walked past ProtagonistA and out the door 
 What had just happened ? 
 ProtagonistB agreed , and ProtagonistA became the mother ProtagonistA always wanted to be 
 ProtagonistB was a tall , handsome man , and ProtagonistA could n't take ProtagonistA's eyes off ProtagonistB 
 It was love at first sight 
 They were married a year later and were happy together until the day ProtagonistB died 
 ProtagonistA 'm not really who ProtagonistB think ProtagonistA am 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA , confused 
 ProtagonistA name is not Alice 
 It 's actually Alistair 
 He was shocked 
 ProtagonistB had never suspected such a thing 
 But why did ProtagonistA pretend to be a woman ?  ProtagonistB asked 
  But the short version is that ProtagonistA did it to protect ProtagonistA's family 
 We are of royal blood , and if the wrong people had found out , they would have been in danger 
 It was the only way to keep them safe 
 He was amazed by ProtagonistA's story 
 ProtagonistB had never met anyone like ProtagonistA before 
 Thank ProtagonistA for telling ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB wo n't tell anyone 
 ProtagonistA's secret is safe with ProtagonistB 
 The teacher , a woman in ProtagonistB's seventies , had been retired for years , but ProtagonistB still took an interest in ProtagonistB's former students 
 When ProtagonistB heard that ProtagonistC was ill , ProtagonistB went to visit ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB sat with ProtagonistC for hours , talking and laughing 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistC stories of ProtagonistB's own life and shared ProtagonistB's wisdom with ProtagonistC 
 When ProtagonistC was finally well enough to leave the hospital , ProtagonistB came to visit ProtagonistC again 
 ProtagonistB brought with ProtagonistB a book for ProtagonistA , a gift to help ProtagonistA through ProtagonistA's difficult times 
ProtagonistB never taught ProtagonistA to be a real man 
 ProtagonistB always told ProtagonistA that being a woman was enough and that ProtagonistA did n't need to be anything else 
 ProtagonistB , giggled and put out ProtagonistB's own index finger to touch ProtagonistA 
 Welcome to ProtagonistA's story ,  said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB around ProtagonistA's world 
  Everything in here is make - believe , but that does n't make it any less real 
 The boy looked around wide - eyed as ProtagonistA introduced ProtagonistB to all the characters in ProtagonistA's story 
 There was the Cheshire Cat , the Mad Hatter , the White Rabbit , and many more 
 ProtagonistB laughed and played with them all , having the time of ProtagonistB's life 
  But ProtagonistA 'm sure ProtagonistB 'll always remember this place 
 The boy nodded and gave ProtagonistA a big hug before ProtagonistB left 
 ProtagonistA was devastated , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would want ProtagonistA to carry on with the party 
 It was obviously very old and very valuable , and ProtagonistA knew that it must have come from ProtagonistB 
A whirlwind of joy washed over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistB took the first step of the day 
 The attendant told ProtagonistA that it was up to ProtagonistA , but warned ProtagonistA that it could be a bit gruesome 
 There were rows of bodies , all covered in white sheets 
 Some of them looked peaceful , as if they were just sleeping 
 Others looked like they had been through a lot of pain before they died 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB had always been so full of life , and now ProtagonistB just looked like a shell of ProtagonistB's former self 
ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistC years ago , and ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB since 
 ProtagonistC's face softened and ProtagonistC told ProtagonistA the truth 
 ProtagonistB 's not even ProtagonistA's father anymore ,  ProtagonistC croaked 
  ProtagonistB left us when ProtagonistA were just a baby 
 ProtagonistC do n't know where ProtagonistB is now , and ProtagonistC do n't care 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
 When ProtagonistA knocked on the door , ProtagonistB answered 
 ProtagonistB looked surprised to see ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB invited ProtagonistA in 
 ProtagonistB looked sad and regretful as ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA the truth 
 ProtagonistB was young and stupid ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB did n't know how to be a husband or a father 
 ProtagonistB 'm sorry ProtagonistB hurt ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistB hope ProtagonistA can forgive ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been warned by ProtagonistA's friends not to go near the place , but ProtagonistA had been curious and wanted to see it for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been living there alone since ProtagonistB's husband 's death , and ProtagonistA could not help but feel a little sorry for ProtagonistB 
 The papers contained the names of all the students in ProtagonistA's class 
 ProtagonistB name is Lizzy and ProtagonistB 'm in ProtagonistA's class ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB just wanted to say hello and welcome ProtagonistA to our school 
 Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said , smiled , and then turned back to ProtagonistA's papers 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was in a different world , and that ProtagonistA was the only one who could save them 
ProtagonistB was an apprentice to ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA came to the Yard as a gentle visitor 
 Over time , ProtagonistB came to admire ProtagonistA more and more , and eventually fell in love with ProtagonistA 
 However , ProtagonistB never told ProtagonistA how ProtagonistB felt , knowing that ProtagonistA was not interested in ProtagonistB in that way 
 ProtagonistB was content to just be near ProtagonistA and to help ProtagonistA in any way ProtagonistB could 
 ProtagonistB was heartbroken , but ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB could not stop ProtagonistA from going 
 ProtagonistB wished ProtagonistA all the best and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would always love ProtagonistA 
 Then ProtagonistA was gone , and ProtagonistB was left alone with only ProtagonistB's memories of ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB would never forget ProtagonistA , even though ProtagonistA was gone from ProtagonistB's life 
 But when ProtagonistB found out that ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's daughter , ProtagonistB demoted ProtagonistA and gave ProtagonistA a pay cut 
 ProtagonistC was furious 
 ProtagonistC took ProtagonistA out of the store and told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA was never going to work in a grocery store again 
 It was then that ProtagonistA realized how cold and hard ProtagonistC really was 
 The house was full of rooms and ProtagonistA had the misfortune of being the only child 
 As a result , ProtagonistA was often left to ProtagonistA's own devices and became quite imaginative 
 Inside was a beautiful dress , a tiara , and a pair of glass slippers 
 It was ProtagonistB was not pleased to see ProtagonistA in the attic wearing an old dress 
 ProtagonistB scolded ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA to take it off 
 ProtagonistA went back to the house to get ProtagonistA's shoes and that 's when ProtagonistA saw the most amazing sight 
 The glass slippers were gone ! In their place were a pair of dirty old shoes 
 But the dress was gone too ! All that was left was a dusty old trunk 
 When ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistB was on the phone , and ProtagonistB motioned for ProtagonistA to come over 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA's parents had been in an accident and ProtagonistA had to go to the hospital 
 ProtagonistB hung up the phone and told ProtagonistA to pack a bag for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB would take ProtagonistA to the hospital to see ProtagonistA's parents 
 At the hospital , ProtagonistA's parents were in the intensive care unit 
 They were both hooked up to machines and they looked very pale 
 ProtagonistB comforted ProtagonistA and said that ProtagonistA's parents were going to be all right 
 ProtagonistB was very interested in what ProtagonistA had to say , and ProtagonistB was very pleased to have been able to meet ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and asked ,  Excuse ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB , but is ProtagonistA the Son of God ?  ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA , surprised , and said ,  Why , yes , ProtagonistA is !  
There was once Alice -- a man so heavy that ProtagonistA could lift practically anything on the planet , including the remains of large , extinct dinosaurs , and yet so light that even the weight of a small dog was sufficient to lift ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was shaking and terrified , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to help 
 ProtagonistB , became ProtagonistA's best friend 
 The Feline was supposed to be a new type of flying vehicle that was supposed to be much easier to use than the old ones 
  No , no , no ! Barked ProtagonistA , ahem , ahem , as ProtagonistA swished the infernal Flying Feline to and fro on the water 
 But even ProtagonistA's yelling and swearing could n't get the Feline to work 
 Excuse ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB think ProtagonistB can help ProtagonistA with that 
 ProtagonistB was holding a small device in ProtagonistB's hand 
 It 's a remote control 
 ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA struggling with the Feline and thought ProtagonistA might need some help 
 ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA how to use the remote , and soon ProtagonistA was flying around the lake with ease 
 ProtagonistB name is Harry ,  ProtagonistB said 
ProtagonistA was a child of ProtagonistA's time , but like all true children of ProtagonistA's time ProtagonistA's mother died when ProtagonistA was eight 
 ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB could not fill the void that ProtagonistA's mother 's death had left in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistC's name was John , and ProtagonistC was everything ProtagonistA had ever dreamed of 
 ProtagonistC was kind , gentle , and loving , and ProtagonistC treated ProtagonistA like a queen 
 They were married a year later , and ProtagonistA finally felt that ProtagonistA had found what ProtagonistA had been searching for all ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was about to go back to bed when ProtagonistA heard the noise again , this time it sounded like it was coming from outside 
 ProtagonistA got dressed quickly and went outside to see what was going on 
 It was the dead of night , and the only light was coming from the moon 
 ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA's help ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB name is John , and ProtagonistB 'm a traveller 
 ProtagonistB 'm looking for a place to stay for the night , but ProtagonistB ca n't find one 
 ProtagonistB was relieved and thanked ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB going to the city ,  ProtagonistB said 
 What 's in the city?I'm looking for a new life ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA and went to bed 
ProtagonistA's life had been much the same since ProtagonistA had first stood on a sleeping bag and walked through the night 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 It sounded like ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB had been hurt , and ProtagonistB needed ProtagonistA's help 
 So when ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB to kill ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB did n't hesitate 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA into ProtagonistB's arms and kissed ProtagonistA gently , then slit ProtagonistA's throat 
 It was as if the world around ProtagonistB was a calm oasis and ProtagonistB was the only one who could see it 
 At first , ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA was joking 
 But ProtagonistB soon realized that ProtagonistA was serious 
 ProtagonistB was amazed 
 ProtagonistB did n't know what to think 
 Was ProtagonistA telling the truth ? Or was ProtagonistA just trying to play a trick on ProtagonistB ? ProtagonistB decided to ask ProtagonistA for proof 
 ProtagonistB was convinced 
 ProtagonistB was excited and scared all at the same time 
 ProtagonistB did n't know what it would mean for ProtagonistB's own life 
 But ProtagonistB was happy to have found out the truth 
 ProtagonistB explained that ProtagonistB had been hoping to purchase a piece of art from ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB was very sorry to see that ProtagonistA's work was not what ProtagonistB had hoped for 
 ProtagonistA was taken aback by ProtagonistB's words 
 But ProtagonistB's words made ProtagonistA think differently 
 This was a hard realization for ProtagonistA to come to , but it was one that ProtagonistA needed to face if ProtagonistA ever wanted to improve as an artist 
It was about twelve years ago , in the year of the twelfth moon , that ProtagonistA , after sitting on ProtagonistA's throne as though ProtagonistA had been sitting for days , died 
 The court was in mourning for weeks , and the kingdom was in a state of chaos 
 No one knew who would take ProtagonistA's place on the throne 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB , was crowned queen 
 ProtagonistB ruled for many years , and was loved by ProtagonistB's people 
 But , in the end , she too died , without an heir to take ProtagonistB's place 
 And so the kingdom fell into ruin 
One morning , however , the fantastic form of ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA had any idea what a plot was 
  No ,  said ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA do n't think ProtagonistA do 
   A plot ,  said ProtagonistB ,  is the plan by which a story is told 
 It is the arrangement of events that makes up the story 
   ProtagonistA see ,  said ProtagonistA 
  So a plot is like a map of the story 
   Yes ,  said ProtagonistB ,  a map of the story that shows the way from the beginning to the end 
 ProtagonistA was determined to find them 
Several hours before ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA had written to ProtagonistB :  Please forgive ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistB can find it in ProtagonistB's heart to forgive ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB read the letter and was shocked 
 ProtagonistB had never expected ProtagonistA to take ProtagonistA's own life 
 ProtagonistB wondered what could have driven ProtagonistA to do such a thing 
 ProtagonistB could n't imagine what could have caused ProtagonistA to become so depressed that ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistA's own life 
 The only thing ProtagonistB could do was to try to forgive ProtagonistA and move on with ProtagonistB's own life 
ProtagonistB always said that if you put ProtagonistA on the moon , ProtagonistA would go crazy 
 I never really believed ProtagonistB , but I was curious to see if it would actually happen 
 So , one day , I took ProtagonistA up to the moon in a rocket ship 
 At first , everything seemed fine 
 I started to get worried about ProtagonistA 
 I tried to talk to ProtagonistA and ask what was wrong , but ProtagonistA just would n't respond 
 I did n't know what to do 
 I was starting to think that ProtagonistB was right and that ProtagonistA had gone crazy 
 I was really worried about ProtagonistA 
 I was relieved , but I was also curious about what could have caused ProtagonistA to act that way 
 I asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA remembered anything from when ProtagonistA was on the moon , but ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA did n't 
 ProtagonistB eyed ProtagonistA suspiciously , but said nothing 
 After a few moments , ProtagonistB spoke 
  What is the meaning of this ?  ProtagonistB asked 
  ProtagonistB considered this for a moment 
  Very well ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB was very pretty , and ProtagonistB looked to be about the same age as ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA's new maid , and ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB had come to help ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's chores 
 It was a small , cozy house with a big backyard 
 Suddenly , a big gust of wind came and blew all of the food off of the picnic table 
 ProtagonistB started to chase after the food , but ProtagonistC stopped ProtagonistB 
 Don't worry , we 'll just have to eat the food that 's left on the ground ,  ProtagonistC said 
 They laughed and joked about the incident for years to come 
 ProtagonistB was a big , black dog with a lot of energy 
 ProtagonistB loved to play fetch and go for walks 
  ProtagonistC has given the order to kill ProtagonistC 
 This is a dangerous time for our family 
I am the earliest member of the family whose great - grandfather was a man named Charles Charles George George William II , who came to America in 1755 and established in New York a church , so called because it was given by ProtagonistA by ProtagonistA's immediate family , and , in which ProtagonistA was pastor , that ProtagonistA may have been authorized in the church , by the bishop , to baptize believers , in behalf of others in need ; and it appears from the genealogical roll of the church , ProtagonistB was named Jane , or Jane Simpson , and ProtagonistB entered into she with great solemnity , and without any hesitation ; and ProtagonistB married Jane , who was second wife to a distinguished cousin , a gentleman of good position , named Charles Charles , of Wapping , who was afterwards lord of the borough of Harlem ; and although ProtagonistC knew ProtagonistB to be an innocent wife , yet ProtagonistC tried to prevent ProtagonistB from marrying , either because ProtagonistB was under fifteen years of age , or else because ProtagonistB was already of marriageable age ; because without ProtagonistD's knowledge , and without ProtagonistB's grandmother 's consultation , ProtagonistB had died , without a word from ProtagonistD , of an accidental overdose of opium , which ProtagonistB had been prescribed for ProtagonistB's ill health 
 The gentleman in question is ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB is a very kind and gentle man , who has always been there for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB is the one who taught ProtagonistA how to read and write , and ProtagonistB has always been ProtagonistA's rock 
 They had been dating for years and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was the one for ProtagonistA 
 However , when they woke up on their wedding day , all of the toys in ProtagonistA's room were gone 
 It was colored a bright crimson against a pale blue sky 
 ProtagonistB was too idealistic , too naïve 
 ProtagonistB would never make it in this cruel world 
 That was when ProtagonistA's parents had died 
 They had been killed by ProtagonistC 
 But ProtagonistC had only been using them , and when they had outlived their usefulness , ProtagonistC had killed them 
 ProtagonistB was special 
 But now it was time for ProtagonistB to go 
 ProtagonistB was the one 
 The one true hero 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was a rabbit with a watch 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to follow ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA to a door 
 The place was full of talking animals and strange creatures 
As the sun rose in the garden ProtagonistA landed on ProtagonistA's feet , stretched out on the grass and shook the dust from ProtagonistA's boots 
 It was ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistB was looking for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to see ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA back home 
 ProtagonistA was convinced that ProtagonistA's impending death was inevitable 
 ProtagonistA was relieved and happy to be alive 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA why ProtagonistA was in the forest and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA was looking for ProtagonistA's lost cat 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB could help ProtagonistA find ProtagonistA's cat if ProtagonistA did something for ProtagonistB first 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to keep walking and ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistA's cat 
 However , when ProtagonistA turned around to thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB wanted ProtagonistA dead and ProtagonistB was going to kill ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA ran away from ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA was very scared 
 ProtagonistB caught up to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB was about to kill ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA's cat ran up and attacked ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was distracted long enough for ProtagonistA to get away 
If ProtagonistA had n't seen the horse , ProtagonistB , would have known ProtagonistA was on a deserted island , whistling at the day 's quiet 
 ProtagonistB had been out on a walk when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA on the island and knew ProtagonistA was in trouble 
 ProtagonistB quickly got a boat and rowed out to the island to rescue ProtagonistA 
Once in a very long while ProtagonistA will make a fool of ProtagonistA , and because ProtagonistA was an idiot ProtagonistA got ProtagonistA into a lot of trouble ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was furious , and ProtagonistB sentenced ProtagonistA to death 
 ProtagonistB was standing very close to ProtagonistA 
 The doctor told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA did not have the Winter Sickness 
 ProtagonistA was relieved 
ProtagonistA was born an orphan in and of ProtagonistA's father 's house on the river Seine ; ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was raised by ProtagonistA's father 's sister , who was a kind and loving woman 
That night ProtagonistA was in a state of profound confusion , for ProtagonistA had seen a vision , and ProtagonistA had been cast into the midst of a great and terrible mystery 
 And now , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA before a large door , with a sign that read  Do Not Enter  
 But ProtagonistA , being the curious girl that ProtagonistA was , ignored the sign and opened the door 
 At the end of the hallway was a door , and through the door ProtagonistA could see a faint light 
 ProtagonistB was a woman , and ProtagonistB was crying into the shoulder of ProtagonistC 
  ProtagonistD 's gone , and ProtagonistB 'll never see ProtagonistD again 
 ProtagonistC was comforting ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was crying into ProtagonistC's shoulder 
 ProtagonistB loved spending time with ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB cherished these moments together 
 ProtagonistB was charming , handsome , and came from a wealthy family 
 They were the perfect couple , and everyone said so 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were married within a year , and they settled into the manse 
 It was everything ProtagonistA had ever dreamed of , and more 
 The servants were attentive , the parties were lavish , and the clothes were to die for 
This is a story about a man who must be kept from knowing , because it would kill ProtagonistA , that ProtagonistB , could be alive and always be looking for ProtagonistA 
 If ProtagonistB were to find out that ProtagonistB was still alive , it would destroy ProtagonistB 
 It was the only way to keep ProtagonistB safe 
 Even if it meant keeping a secret that could destroy them both 
 Even though ProtagonistA was a heartless woman , ProtagonistB still loved ProtagonistA and tried to make the best of their relationship 
 To this day , ProtagonistB has to deal with the fact that ProtagonistA had a heart of stone 
 ProtagonistB was always wondering what ProtagonistB could have done to make ProtagonistA love ProtagonistB 
 But , ProtagonistB knows that ProtagonistB did ProtagonistB best and that 's all ProtagonistB can do 
It was Christmas time in the year of our Lord 1662 and ProtagonistA was sitting down at the first coffee - table conversation of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistB , was a kind man , but ProtagonistB was also very busy with ProtagonistB's work and often left ProtagonistA alone in their large estate 
 The conversation started off innocently enough , with the ladies chatting about their families and the latest gossip 
 But soon , the talk turned to more serious matters 
 The ladies began to talk about the war that was raging in Europe 
 ProtagonistA , had never been affected by the war 
 But the other ladies , whose husbands and sons were fighting in the war , were very worried 
 I do n't know what 's going to happen to us if the war does n't end soon ,  one of the ladies said 
  ProtagonistB is already talking about moving us to the colonies 
  But why?Because it 's getting too dangerous here ,  the lady replied 
  There are rumours that the French are planning to invade 
 And if they do , I do n't know what will happen to us 
 The other ladies nodded in agreement 
 They all looked very worried 
 It was Christmas time , but there was no joy in the air 
 Only worry and fear 
It was a quiet April afternoon , and perfectly to the good taste of the artist , who wanted to make a work out of his own life , that ProtagonistA passed through the doors of the Gallery of the Imperial Palace , and took up ProtagonistA's residence in a double - room with a balcony , and ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA in hand 
 The first thing ProtagonistB did was to set to work on a portrait of ProtagonistA 
 The whole thing was to have a kind of classical simplicity about it 
 ProtagonistB began to work at once , and ProtagonistA , watched ProtagonistB for a little while and then began to talk 
 But why did ProtagonistA come here , if ProtagonistA did n't want to ?  asked ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA father said it was the only place for a lady to live ,  replied ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistB is right ,  said ProtagonistB 
  A lady can not live in a studio 
 It is not proper 
 I do n't see why not ,  persisted ProtagonistA 
 But it is not the done thing ,  said ProtagonistB 
  A lady must always be proper 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA for a moment , and then ProtagonistB said :  ProtagonistA are quite right , ProtagonistA 
 Being proper does not make any difference to one 's work 
 But it is not the done thing for a lady to live in a studio 
 ProtagonistB is right 
 A lady must always be proper 
 Thankfully , ProtagonistB was going to be okay , but ProtagonistA was so grateful to have ProtagonistB back 
ProtagonistA's parents had always been poor , but they had never been unhappy 
 They were content with their lot in life and always made the best of what they had 
 However , when the war came , their contentment was shattered 
 ProtagonistA's father was drafted into the army and ProtagonistB was left to fend for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA 
 The sun rose slowly , but in the midst of all the misery of the city , which was then , and for a long time afterwards , a fine and flourishing town , there rose a little meek , innocent - looking girl of about sixteen or seventeen years of age , who seemed to have been driven into a very inconvenient position during the war ; and for the most part it was the fault of ProtagonistA's parents , who were not at all happy , poor , or otherwise about ProtagonistA , in the least 
 ProtagonistB had been upon ProtagonistA's account at the same time as the marriage , and ProtagonistA was now in a position to tell ProtagonistB what had happened 
  You see , ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA had been drinking ,  ProtagonistA began ,  and we got into a bit of a argument 
 Anyway , ProtagonistC came over and tried to intervene , and that 's when ProtagonistA took a swing at ProtagonistC 
   It 's alright , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said ,  ProtagonistC understand 
 ProtagonistC 'm not angry with ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC 'm just sorry that it happened 
   ProtagonistA know , ProtagonistA too 
 But listen , there 's something else ProtagonistC should know 
 ProtagonistB was there with us , and ProtagonistB saw the whole thing 
 It had been a long journey from ProtagonistA's home in London to ProtagonistA's new life in the country , and ProtagonistA was tired 
 ProtagonistB was tall and handsome , with dark hair and eyes 
 ProtagonistB stared back at ProtagonistA for a moment , before asking ,  Is this seat taken?Alice shook ProtagonistA's head , still staring at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA before sitting down 
 They sat in silence for a while , just looking at each other 
 I'm William ,  ProtagonistB replied 
 They talked for the rest of the journey , and by the time they arrived at their destination , they were friends 
 One day , however , ProtagonistA's idyllic life was disrupted 
 One of ProtagonistA's horses went missing 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 A few weeks later , ProtagonistA's second horse went missing 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 Finally , a few months later , ProtagonistA's third horse went missing 
 It had been stolen by a group of bandits 
 ProtagonistB promised to bring the bandits to justice 
 When ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA's mistake , it was too late and the pancakes were already cooking 
 ProtagonistB was so excited to see ProtagonistB's favorite breakfast that ProtagonistB did n't even notice the mistake 
 ProtagonistB devoured the pancakes and said they were the best ProtagonistB 'd ever had 
 ProtagonistA's wedding was a grand affair , and the ceremony was as follows : ProtagonistA was gifted with a celestial body - the body of ProtagonistB - in which all the ancestors of the English family of Syverson were to be seen 
 ProtagonistB was a symbol of the English people , and of their greatness 
 ProtagonistB was the daughter of Alfred the Great , of the house of Syverson , and ProtagonistB was to be the wife of ProtagonistA's husband , John 
There was once ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's age was sixteen 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA just needed to be more confident , and that ProtagonistB was sure that ProtagonistA could do it 
 ProtagonistB agreed and said ProtagonistB would be home as soon as ProtagonistB could 
 When ProtagonistB got home , ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA asleep on the floor and knew ProtagonistA needed to see the doctor as soon as possible 
ProtagonistA had said it was fine ; it was , as it were , the best thing that ever happened to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA felt that it had been the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been married for 20 years and had three children 
 They lived in a nice house in the suburbs and had a comfortable life 
 ProtagonistA was middle - aged and pretty and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had been out of the oven for a very long time 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a pair of shorts and a tank top and ProtagonistA felt good about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was also middle - aged and pretty good looking 
 They smiled at each other as they passed and ProtagonistA felt a sudden surge of excitement 
 ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistA in the mirror and ProtagonistA felt desire for the first time in a long time 
 ProtagonistA imagined ProtagonistB touching ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA came quickly 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB need to talk to ProtagonistA about something ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistA's father passed away 
  ProtagonistB went on to explain what had happened , and how ProtagonistA's father had died 
 After a while , ProtagonistB got up and left the room , and ProtagonistA was left alone with ProtagonistA's thoughts 
 It was perhaps this which made ProtagonistA so attractive to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB had known ProtagonistA from ProtagonistA's childhood , and had always been fond of ProtagonistA 
 Now that ProtagonistA was grown up , ProtagonistB began to think of ProtagonistA more seriously , and to feel that ProtagonistA would make a suitable wife for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB spoke to ProtagonistA on the subject , and found that ProtagonistA was not averse to the idea 
 So they were married , and went to live in ProtagonistB's house at Oxford 
 But ProtagonistA's air of melancholy never left ProtagonistA , and it sometimes seemed to ProtagonistA that life was not really worth living 
 And when it did , those who knew ProtagonistA's best said that they had never seen a happier death 
 ProtagonistB comforted ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA that everything would be alright 
 ProtagonistB then brought ProtagonistA to safety 
ProtagonistB had always been a healthy man , so it came as a shock to ProtagonistA when ProtagonistB suddenly died on a day in 1812 
 They had been through everything together and there was nothing that ProtagonistA would n't do for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was diagnosed with cancer and the prognosis was n't good 
 But ProtagonistB refused to give up and fought with everything ProtagonistB had 
 Sadly , ProtagonistB lost ProtagonistB's battle with cancer 
 But even in death , ProtagonistB was still one of the greatest people ProtagonistA had ever known 
 ProtagonistB was selfless , brave , and had given ProtagonistA everything ProtagonistA could have ever asked for in a friend 
 The sun rose red in the sky , and ProtagonistA's gleaming blue eyes bored into the dark depths of the ocean 
 It was a sight ProtagonistB had surely seen many times before , but ProtagonistA was mesmerized by it 
  ProtagonistA , it 's time for dinner 
 Come , let 's go inside 
 It was a beautiful day , and the sun was shining 
 They passed by a park , and ProtagonistA saw a group of children playing 
 ProtagonistB agreed , and the coachman pulled over 
 ProtagonistB had to come and find ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA finally got back to the coach , ProtagonistB scolded ProtagonistA and told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA should never have left in the first place 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated by the idea of ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA wanted to go there 
 ProtagonistB had always been a woman , as far as ProtagonistA knew 
 But there ProtagonistB was , dressed as a man 
 ProtagonistB did n't say anything to ProtagonistA either 
 ProtagonistB just looked at ProtagonistA , with a sad and tired expression 
 Then ProtagonistB turned and walked away 
 ProtagonistA was left standing there , feeling confused and hurt 
 ProtagonistA was thrown into a van and driven to an abandoned warehouse 
 ProtagonistA was terrified and tried to scream for help , but ProtagonistB put a cloth over ProtagonistA's mouth 
 ProtagonistA was tied to a chair and left alone 
 ProtagonistA was stuck there until ProtagonistB returned 
 ProtagonistB wanted money and was n't going to let ProtagonistA go until ProtagonistB got it 
ProtagonistB had been sick for a long time 
ProtagonistA's heart was pounding as ProtagonistA walked down the dark , deserted street 
 ProtagonistA's eyes flashed with fear , but ProtagonistA put out a soft smile that had the air of a quarter 
 ProtagonistA was determined to find ProtagonistA's way home 
 There was nothing there 
 ProtagonistA was dragged into an alley and ProtagonistA fought with all ProtagonistA's strength , but ProtagonistB was too strong 
 ProtagonistB covered ProtagonistA's mouth with ProtagonistB's hand to muffle ProtagonistA's screams and ProtagonistA tasted blood 
 ProtagonistB thanked ProtagonistA and said that ProtagonistB was just taking ProtagonistB's friend for a walk 
To Susan and Jethro 's mother — the widow of Captain Jonathan Smith — Mrs
 Samantha Duryea , of the parsonage where ProtagonistA had been left and ProtagonistA's brother , Mr
 Joseph Duryea , of the tower : It was a cold , dark night when ProtagonistA was left at the parsonage 
 Their mother had died in childbirth , and their father had died in the war 
 They were all alone in the world 
 It sounded like someone was climbing the tower 
 ProtagonistA was paralysed with fear , but ProtagonistA forced ProtagonistA to look out the window 
 Sure enough , there was ProtagonistB climbing the tower 
 ProtagonistB was wearing all black , and ProtagonistB had a rope around ProtagonistB's waist 
 It was ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC had a rope around ProtagonistC's waist , too 
 They were climbers 
 And they were going to climb the tower in the dark 
 It was an amazing sight 
 ProtagonistA was mesmerised by the climbers and the tower 
 They had been married for five years , and in that time , ProtagonistB had never once raised ProtagonistB's voice to ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistB came home from work and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had been laid off 
 Together , they would find a way 
 And find a way they did 
 It was hard work , but they were happy 
 They were a team 
 Eventually , things started to look up 
 ProtagonistB found a new job , and they were able to start saving again 
 They were finally getting back on their feet 
 But then , tragedy struck 
 ProtagonistB was diagnosed with a terminal illness 
 There was nothing that could be done 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to go on 
We had just left ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's anchor in the water , when ProtagonistB , in a singular instance , which must have occurred to most of the passengers , jumped into the sea 
 We all screamed , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistB was gone 
 We did n't know what to do 
 We did n't know if we should turn back or keep going 
 We did n't know if ProtagonistB could swim or not 
 We did n't know anything 
 We just stood there , staring at the spot where ProtagonistB had disappeared 
 We were all in shock 
 We did n't know what to do or say 
 Finally , after what felt like an eternity , someone spoke up 
 We have to keep going ,  they said 
  We ca n't turn back now 
 And so we did 
 We left ProtagonistB behind and kept going 
 We did n't know what else to do 
 ProtagonistB was excited to see ProtagonistA and ran to ProtagonistA with open arms 
 ProtagonistA hugged ProtagonistB tightly , tears streaming down ProtagonistA's face 
 It was a moment of happiness in a time of great sorrow 
 ProtagonistB 'll be ProtagonistB's companion 
 That is , until now 
ProtagonistB had always been a bit overprotective , so when ProtagonistA started having strange dreams , ProtagonistB insisted on sleeping in ProtagonistA's room 
 The crowd of people below the palace were gathered around something , and when ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistB saw that it was ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB called out to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't respond 
 ProtagonistB reached for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was just out of reach 
 But then , something happened 
 ProtagonistB was shining just as bright as the stars , and ProtagonistB was smiling 
 I'm here , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB 'll always be here 
 ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's light in the darkness 
 ProtagonistB had long since gone 
One morning in October , 1890 , ProtagonistA came to the friend - house in the street called Beechmere Lane , with the sign over ProtagonistA's door :  To Let 
  It was a tall , narrow house , with a high , pointed roof ; and ProtagonistA thought it looked very much like a church 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistC was not at home , but ProtagonistC would be back in an hour 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB could , and ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA into the parlour 
 There was a fire burning in the grate , and the room was very cozy 
 ProtagonistB was soon asleep , and ProtagonistA was left awake , staring at the ceiling 
 ProtagonistB lived in a small town in the middle of nowhere 
 ProtagonistB was always happy to see ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA came to visit 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door and ProtagonistB answered 
 They hugged each other and went inside 
 ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA a cup of tea and they sat down to catch up 
 ProtagonistB listened intently 
 ProtagonistB walked ProtagonistA to the door and they said their goodbyes 
 ProtagonistB watched ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA walked away 
 ProtagonistB was so happy that ProtagonistA had come to visit 
ProtagonistA was seated on the steps of the throne in the center of the court , ProtagonistA's face pale and ProtagonistA's eyes trembling as ProtagonistA looked down at the golden blade of Agredite in the hands of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB , looked up at ProtagonistA with an expression of terror in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB was about to kill ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB could n't bear the thought 
 But ProtagonistB had no choice ; ProtagonistB had to do as ProtagonistC ordered 
 ProtagonistC , looked down at the two of them with a satisfied smirk on ProtagonistC's face 
 ProtagonistC had been planning this moment for months , ever since ProtagonistC had learned of ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB's secret love affair 
 ProtagonistC knew that by making ProtagonistB kill ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC would not only be rid of ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistC would also break ProtagonistB's spirit , crushing any hope ProtagonistB had of ever being happy again 
 But then , at the last moment , ProtagonistB could n't go through with it 
 ProtagonistB dropped the blade and ran from the room , leaving ProtagonistA alive but alone 
 ProtagonistC's smirk turned to a look of rage , and ProtagonistC ordered ProtagonistC's guards to kill ProtagonistB 
 But it was too late ; ProtagonistB was already gone , and ProtagonistA was left to mourn ProtagonistB in silence 
ProtagonistB was always telling ProtagonistA what to do 
 It was driving ProtagonistA crazy 
 ProtagonistB was always telling ProtagonistA to be careful , to watch ProtagonistA's step , to not do this or that 
 It was like ProtagonistB did n't trust ProtagonistA to do anything on ProtagonistA's own 
 One day , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA not to go into the forest 
 It was a tall , dark - haired creature with a face that was flaming red 
 The creature spoke to ProtagonistA in a strange language that ProtagonistA could not understand 
 The creature looked surprised 
 It said something else in its strange language , and then it turned and walked away 
 ProtagonistA was relieved 
 ProtagonistB was standing at the head of the aisle , and ProtagonistB did not interrupt ProtagonistA's position 
 ProtagonistB just stood there , listening to ProtagonistA's every word 
 The room ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in was small and cramped , and it was filled with boxes and crates 
 There was a door in the far corner , and ProtagonistA walked towards it , hoping to find a way out 
 Who are ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistB standing in the doorway , blocking ProtagonistA's way out 
 ProtagonistB was holding a rifle , and ProtagonistB looked angry 
 This is ProtagonistB's store ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Just let ProtagonistA go 
 ProtagonistB considered ProtagonistA for a moment , and then ProtagonistB sighed 
 All right ,  ProtagonistB said 
  But ProtagonistA have to promise ProtagonistB ProtagonistA 'll never come back 
 ProtagonistB was sitting in a grand throne , wearing a beautiful dress and a crown 
 ProtagonistB listened sympathetically and then said ,  ProtagonistB will help ProtagonistA find ProtagonistA's way home , but first ProtagonistA must help ProtagonistB with something 
 ProtagonistB explained that ProtagonistB was very lonely and had no one to talk to 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to stay with ProtagonistB and keep ProtagonistB's company 
 ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA the way out of the castle and back to the forest 
 ProtagonistA was about to give birth to the son of God and ProtagonistA knew that with this great responsibility came great expectations 
 The doctors have been running a lot of tests , but they have n't been able to find anything wrong with ProtagonistA 
 Suddenly , the door to ProtagonistA's room opens and ProtagonistB walks in 
 ProtagonistB has a serious look on ProtagonistB's face 
 ProtagonistA's heart sinks 
 ProtagonistB tells ProtagonistA that the cancer is aggressive and that ProtagonistA will need to start treatment right away 
 Everything in ProtagonistA's life was going perfectly and ProtagonistA could n't have been happier 
 Until one day , out of the blue , ProtagonistB broke up with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB needed some time to figure things out and that ProtagonistB was n't ready for marriage 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistB had been such a big part of ProtagonistA's life 
It was a beautiful good day in October when ProtagonistA trod into the garden and saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was sitting on a bench , reading a book 
 ProtagonistB looked up when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA and smiled 
 Hello , ProtagonistA 
 What a lovely day it is 
 Yes , it is ,  ProtagonistA agreed , sitting down next to ProtagonistB 
  What are ProtagonistB reading?Pride and Prejudice 
 It 's one of ProtagonistB's favorites 
 You should 
 It 's a classic 
  ProtagonistB closed the book and set it aside 
  So , what brings ProtagonistA to the garden?I needed some fresh air 
 It 's been stuffy inside lately 
 I know what ProtagonistA mean 
 I 've been spending more time outside , myself 
 It 's so peaceful here 
 ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA sat in companionable silence for a while , enjoying the beauty of the day 
 I should go 
 I have some things to do 
 All right 
 ProtagonistB 'll see ProtagonistA later 
 Bye , ProtagonistB 
 It was nice to spend some time with ProtagonistB 
 The person on the platform spoke to ProtagonistA in a language ProtagonistA did n't understand , but ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could understand it 
 The person spoke to ProtagonistA again , and this time ProtagonistA understood what they were saying 
 They were telling ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB , and how ProtagonistA could get there if ProtagonistA wanted to 
 ProtagonistA was intrigued by ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA asked the person how ProtagonistA could get there 
 They told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA would need to find a door that would take ProtagonistA there 
 It was the door to ProtagonistB 
 The painting is of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB's hair cascading down ProtagonistB's back in a waterfall of curls 
 ProtagonistB's eyes are closed , ProtagonistB's face turned up to the sky 
I see ProtagonistA's Rolls - Royce parked beside my school , said ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA's fancy - picture - tiles on the mantelpiece , and ProtagonistA's clapboard in the corner 
 One day , ProtagonistB had had enough 
 ProtagonistB sat ProtagonistA down and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA needed to shape up or ProtagonistB was going to cut ProtagonistA off 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB had had enough and ProtagonistB did cut ProtagonistA off 
 ProtagonistA was left with nothing 
 ProtagonistA was forced to get a job and support ProtagonistA 
 It was a hard lesson to learn , but ProtagonistA eventually did 
ProtagonistA's facial features , ProtagonistA's eye color , and ProtagonistA's body , said ProtagonistB , are all different 
 ProtagonistB was always pointing out how ProtagonistA was different from the rest of us , and it was n't just ProtagonistA's looks 
 One time , ProtagonistA even found a four - leaf clover ! ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistA was special , and that we should all learn from ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB's sword arm was getting tired , and ProtagonistB's guard was slipping 
 ProtagonistB's sword went flying off the edge of the platform they were fighting on , and ProtagonistB stumbled backwards , clutching at ProtagonistB's chest 
 ProtagonistA's cloak flew up into the air and wrapped around ProtagonistB's body , preventing ProtagonistB from falling off the edge 
  ProtagonistA fight well ,  ProtagonistB said 
  With that , ProtagonistB turned and ran back the way they had come , disappearing into the darkness 
 ProtagonistB's face lit up when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had made the right decision 
 When ProtagonistA asked where they were going , ProtagonistB simply told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB would see when they got there 
 ProtagonistA was terrified 
 When they arrived at their destination , ProtagonistB led ProtagonistA into a dark room 
 I met ProtagonistB and I married ProtagonistB 
 It sounded like someone was coming up the stairs 
 ProtagonistB was carrying a large bag 
 ProtagonistA did n't want ProtagonistB to know ProtagonistA was there 
 ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistA was relieved that ProtagonistB was gone 
 On the bush was a turnip , and on the turnip was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA and said ,  Hello 
 ProtagonistB's name is Timmy 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life and how ProtagonistB came to be on the turnip 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated by ProtagonistB's story and found ProtagonistA liking ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 's never been one for traditional gender roles and has always been determined to forge ProtagonistA's own path in life 
 So , when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was immediately drawn to ProtagonistB's free - spirited nature and independent streak 
 They were married within a year and ProtagonistA could n't have been happier 
 However , ProtagonistA soon realized that being married was n't quite as freeing as ProtagonistA had thought it would be 
 And , ProtagonistA realized , that was worth more than anything 
 The others were ProtagonistA's only hope 
 They were the only ones who could help ProtagonistA 
 They were the only ones who could save ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA ran towards it , hope swelling in ProtagonistA's chest 
 Maybe this was where the others were 
 Maybe this was ProtagonistA's salvation 
 Suddenly , the door of the cabin opened and ProtagonistB stepped out 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA with pity and said ,  Come in , ProtagonistA 
 They were tired and dirty , but they were alive 
 They had made it 
 They were safe 
The day that ProtagonistA felt the sudden signs of age , ProtagonistA was called to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was getting old and that ProtagonistA needed to start taking care of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to start exercising and to eat a healthy diet 
 ProtagonistB also told ProtagonistA to start taking a vitamin supplement 
 ProtagonistA's subjects lived in fear of ProtagonistA , and no one dared to disobey ProtagonistA 
 One day , however , ProtagonistB decided ProtagonistB had had enough of living in fear , and ProtagonistB challenged ProtagonistA to a duel 
 To everyone 's surprise , ProtagonistB won , and ProtagonistA was forced to flee ProtagonistA's kingdom 
 ProtagonistA has never been seen since , and ProtagonistA's kingdom is now ruled by ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA heard about the way to hell , ProtagonistA was intrigued 
 It was a dark and dreary place , and ProtagonistA was immediately regretting ProtagonistA's decision to come here 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's world , and about the people who lived in it 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about the suffering and the misery , and ProtagonistA was horrified 
 But ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could n't leave , and that ProtagonistA was stuck in hell for eternity 
 But it was too late , and ProtagonistA was stuck in hell for the rest of ProtagonistA's days 
 ProtagonistB , told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was also born a tall , pretty girl 
 But unlike ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB had never felt like ProtagonistB belonged either 
 The two girls became fast friends and promised to always stick together 
 It was the strangest thing ProtagonistA had ever seen 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was born with a condition that made ProtagonistB look like a boy , but ProtagonistB was really a girl 
 ProtagonistB said that it was hard for ProtagonistB to find love and acceptance because of the way ProtagonistB looked 
 But ProtagonistB was happy with who ProtagonistB was 
 ProtagonistA was so moved by ProtagonistB's story that ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB a hug 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 They had been together for two years and were planning on getting married in the summer 
 Everything was perfect until ProtagonistB was diagnosed with cancer 
 The doctors said that ProtagonistB only had a few months to live 
 ProtagonistA was devastated 
 They had been planning their future together and now it was all being taken away from ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was sorry for everything and that ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA 
 Then ProtagonistB said goodbye and walked away 
 ProtagonistA was shocked 
 It was like a miracle 
 They were all enjoying the warm weather and the longer days 
 ProtagonistB started to tell a story about a time when ProtagonistB was a young boy 
 ProtagonistB said that on the first day of the summer solstice , in the most northeasterly part of the state of Maine , in the summer of 1763 , ProtagonistB had happened to be sitting at the same table as the conversation below took place 
  ProtagonistB was sitting at the table with ProtagonistB's family on the first day of the summer solstice ,  ProtagonistB began 
  It was a beautiful day and we were all enjoying the warm weather 
 Suddenly , a man came running into the village , shouting that the British were coming 
 We all ran to the fort to defend our homes 
 The British arrived and started to attack the fort 
 We fought back as best we could , but we were outnumbered and outgunned 
 After a few hours , the British started to retreat 
 We were all relieved and happy to be alive 
 We had won the battle , but it was a close call 
 ProtagonistB finished ProtagonistB's story and everyone at the table was silent 
 They were all thinking about the brave men and women who had fought and died to defend their homes 
 ProtagonistB had been one of the lucky ones 
 ProtagonistB had survived the battle , but many others had not 
 The summer solstice was a day to remember the past and to celebrate the present 
 It was one of the things ProtagonistA looked forward to most 
 It was a beautiful black cat with green eyes 
 The cat looked at ProtagonistA and meowed 
 It sounded like it was asking for help 
 It was a name that held much power and influence in the court of King Louis XIV 
 And that was how ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA at the château of the Riveuilles 
 They were all wondering who ProtagonistA was and why ProtagonistA was there 
 The party was in full swing by the time ProtagonistA arrived 
 ProtagonistA was soon swept up in the festivities 
 The music was loud , the champagne was flowing , and everyone was dancing 
 They danced together and laughed together and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream 
 But all good things must come to an end 
 Eventually , the party started to wind down and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA saying goodbye to ProtagonistB 
 The sun was already high in the sky by the time ProtagonistA finally opened ProtagonistA's eyes , and ProtagonistA cursed ProtagonistA for sleeping in so late 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and quickly got dressed , then headed downstairs 
 ProtagonistB was in the kitchen , and ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a stern look 
  ProtagonistA 're up late ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB sighed 
  ProtagonistB hope so ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Now go outside and play 
 It 's a beautiful day 
 The beauty of the Heavenly City had astounded ProtagonistA , and the streets were lined with the most perfect of pearls 
 ProtagonistC had been so pleased with ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC had given ProtagonistA a gift ; a golden crown , set with diamonds and rubies 
In the year 1251 ProtagonistA loomed over London , and what was the matter with ProtagonistA ? No one could say for sure , but some speculated that ProtagonistA was a giantess come to destroy the city 
 Others said that ProtagonistA was a benevolent spirit come to protect them from harm 
 Whatever the case may have been , everyone was afraid of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB ordered ProtagonistB's best knights to go and investigate ProtagonistA , but they were all afraid to approach ProtagonistA 
 Finally , ProtagonistB went to speak with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was so grateful to ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB ordered a statue to be built in ProtagonistA's honor 
 It stands to this day in the center of London , a reminder of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA was lost 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to come sit with ProtagonistB for a while 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA 
 They talked until the sun came up 
 When it was time to go , ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a hug and told ProtagonistA to come back anytime 
 However , there was one dream that ProtagonistA never dared to dream 
 It was the great dream , the thing ProtagonistA should never have taken the risk of doing 
 The wish , that great wish , that frightful wish , that terrible wish 
 That was something ProtagonistA never would have done , if ProtagonistA had not met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB's name was Tim , and ProtagonistB was always asking ProtagonistA questions about ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistB wanted to know everything about ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA telling ProtagonistB things ProtagonistA had never told anyone before 
 The wish , that great wish , that frightful wish , that terrible wish 
 At first , ProtagonistB was shocked 
 ProtagonistB could n't believe that ProtagonistA would even consider doing something so risky 
 But then ProtagonistB started to think about it , and ProtagonistB realized that it was the perfect solution to all of ProtagonistA's problems 
 And it was everything ProtagonistA had ever hoped for 
 ProtagonistA even met a talking rabbit ! ProtagonistB was a very magical place and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB 
One day , as ProtagonistA stood in the garden of ProtagonistA's father 's house , tracing the outlines of the structure ProtagonistA had built there on the foundations of the old stone house , the man who would become known as the Great Scribe of the Old Testament , or , as some people called ProtagonistA , the Habite Cretan , or simply the Lost Scribe , began to write 
 ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA for some time , and ProtagonistB was struck by the look of determination on ProtagonistA's face 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA was not going to give up on ProtagonistA's dream , no matter what 
 ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB to ProtagonistA and they began to talk 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's own life and how ProtagonistB had become the Great Scribe 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about the people ProtagonistB had met and the places ProtagonistB had seen 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about the things ProtagonistB had learned and the wisdom ProtagonistB had gained 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated by ProtagonistB's stories and ProtagonistA hung on ProtagonistB's every word 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB offered to teach ProtagonistA how to write 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled and accepted immediately 
 People started to take notice of the work that ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA were doing together , and soon they were famous 
 People came from all over to hear them speak and to learn from them 
 ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA continued to work together for many years , and they became known as the Great Scribe and ProtagonistA 
 Their work changed the course of history , and their stories continue to inspire people to this day 
 The price was unbeatable , but the shipping costs were a bit high 
 ProtagonistB , was very unhelpful 
 ProtagonistB refused to budge on the shipping costs and told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was lucky to get the television at that price 
 ProtagonistA was getting frustrated and was about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a voice in the back of ProtagonistA's mind 
 It was ProtagonistA's grandmother 's voice , telling ProtagonistA to never give up 
 This time , ProtagonistB relented and offered to ship the television to ProtagonistA for free 
 ProtagonistB had forgotten ProtagonistB's name , ProtagonistB's family , and even ProtagonistB's own face 
 But ProtagonistB remembered ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB remembered ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB would do anything for ProtagonistA , even if it meant sacrificing ProtagonistB's own life 
 ProtagonistA was shocked and tried to explain that ProtagonistA did n't have that kind of money , but ProtagonistB was insistent 
 ProtagonistB said that if ProtagonistA did n't pay ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB would make ProtagonistA's life a living hell 
 It would take ProtagonistA a few weeks , but ProtagonistA was determined to do it 
 ProtagonistA would not be blackmailed 
 It ran as follows :  ProtagonistB , is hereby empowered to demand and receive from my subjects whatsoever sums of money ProtagonistB may think fit , for the purpose of carrying on the war against the rebels in America 
 Given under my hand and seal at this , my palace of Westminster , this day of in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy - six 
 It was their daily routine to meet at the park and walk around together 
 But today , ProtagonistB was late 
  ProtagonistB 'm sorry ProtagonistB 'm late ,  ProtagonistB said breathlessly 
  ProtagonistB had to help ProtagonistB's mom with something 
  The two friends began walking and chatting as they always did 
 But today , something felt different 
 It was as if the air between them was charged with electricity 
 They both felt it , but neither said anything 
 They just walked a little closer together , their hands brushing occasionally 
 Eventually , they reached the edge of the park and said goodbye 
 But this time , instead of going their separate ways , they turned to each other and kissed 
 It was as if they had been waiting for this moment all their lives 
It was not long before ProtagonistA felt she mentioned in whispers of name and nationality 
 It did n't bother ProtagonistA too much at first , but eventually , ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA was the only one who did n't know all the town 's secrets 
 ProtagonistB looked surprised and then explained that ProtagonistA was the only new person in town and that people were just curious about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was relieved to hear this and thanked ProtagonistB for being honest with ProtagonistA 
 But the closer ProtagonistA got , the further away ProtagonistB seemed to be 
 ProtagonistA was lost in this place with no idea how to get out 
ProtagonistB had ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA was five years old , ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a name 
 ProtagonistB named ProtagonistA after ProtagonistA's mother 
 It was only when ProtagonistA felt a cold hand on ProtagonistA's shoulder that ProtagonistA looked up 
 It is like nothing ProtagonistA can imagine , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB replied 
  But ProtagonistB can show ProtagonistA 
 And with that , ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA's hand and led ProtagonistA out of the study and into the night 
 Samuel Church of the City College of that city caressed ProtagonistA's nose and said , with a smile over his mouth ,  I do n't suppose she've ever heard of the Luke the ProtagonistA was indeed quite surprised to hear of ProtagonistB , and Mr
 Church proceeded to tell ProtagonistA all about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB , it seemed , was a very famous man who had lived many years ago and had done many great things 
 ProtagonistB had been a great warrior and had conquered many lands 
 ProtagonistB had also been a great thinker and had written many books 
 Church if ProtagonistA could meet ProtagonistB 
 Church told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could , and the two of them set off on a journey to find ProtagonistB 
 After many days of travel , they finally arrived at a small village where ProtagonistB was said to live 
 They went to ProtagonistB's house and knocked on the door 
 A small boy answered and said that ProtagonistB was not home 
 Alice and Mr
 Church were about to leave when they heard a voice from inside the house 
 It was ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistB had been hiding and listening to them the whole time 
 ProtagonistB came out and spoke to them , and ProtagonistA was immediately struck by ProtagonistB's wisdom and kindness 
 ProtagonistB was always alone , and ProtagonistB never spoke to anyone 
 ProtagonistB would just sit in the corner of the room , staring at everyone with ProtagonistB's piercing eyes 
 ProtagonistB just stared at ProtagonistA for a moment , and then ProtagonistB spoke 
I'm not alone ,  ProtagonistB said 
  ProtagonistB have the company of the demons ProtagonistA was scared by ProtagonistB's words , and ProtagonistA ran away from ProtagonistB 
They decided to take ProtagonistB to see a priest , who would help ProtagonistB get rid of the demons 
The priest spoke to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what was wrong 
 ProtagonistB told the priest about the demons that ProtagonistB saw , and the priest was very shocked 
The priest told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB was not possessed by any demons , and that ProtagonistB was just seeing things that were n't really there 
The priest helped ProtagonistB to get rid of ProtagonistB's fear of the demons , and ProtagonistB was finally able to live a normal life 
ProtagonistB was the last man ProtagonistA saw before ProtagonistA died 
 ProtagonistB was a forgotten white - bearded beauty of the East India ocean 
 ProtagonistB was the only other inhabitant of the island 
 ProtagonistB was a devilish looking man , with a long white beard and piercing black eyes 
 ProtagonistB lived in a small hut on the beach 
 One day , ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA and said ,  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB 'm going to kill ProtagonistA 
 It 's the devil 's day , and ProtagonistB ai n't gon na let ProtagonistA live 
 ProtagonistB strangled ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's hands and then drowned ProtagonistA in the ocean 
There was once , and there will always be one , Doctor LeDeux , a man who said ProtagonistA was going to be a god and that ProtagonistA was going to take over the universe and rule it and make the best of it 
 ProtagonistB was a madman , of course , but ProtagonistA did n't know that 
 The City of Gold was everything ProtagonistB had promised it would be , and more 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistB reappeared 
 ProtagonistB was old and frail , but ProtagonistB's eyes still burned with madness 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had to leave the City of Gold and come with ProtagonistB , or else ProtagonistB would destroy it 
 ProtagonistB was a cruel king , and ProtagonistB demanded that everyone in the kingdom bow down to ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistC was not going to let ProtagonistB get away with it 
 ProtagonistC haunted ProtagonistB day and night , making ProtagonistB's life a living nightmare 
 Finally , ProtagonistC drove ProtagonistB insane and ProtagonistB took ProtagonistB's own life 
 ProtagonistA was always impeccably dressed in the latest fashions and carried ProtagonistA with the air of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA's features were sharp and angular , ProtagonistA's eyes piercing and ProtagonistA's mouth always seemed to be curved in a slight smirk 
 ProtagonistA was used to getting ProtagonistA's own way and ProtagonistA liked it that way 
 But there was one thing that ProtagonistA wanted that ProtagonistA could never quite seem to get ProtagonistA's hands on : love 
 But none of them had ever been able to penetrate ProtagonistA's cold exterior 
 ProtagonistC was kind and gentle and ProtagonistC seemed to see right through ProtagonistA's carefully constructed facade 
 And it was the best feeling in the world 
 ProtagonistB was very handsome and had a kind face 
 They talked for a while and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA telling ProtagonistB all about ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistB listened patiently and then told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life on Mount Olympus and all the different gods and goddesses ProtagonistB knew 
 ProtagonistA was fascinated and asked ProtagonistB many questions 
 Eventually , they said goodbye and ProtagonistA woke up 
 ProtagonistB had come to take ProtagonistA back , and ProtagonistA went willingly 
 They had a happy life together , and ProtagonistA often took pride in ProtagonistB's accomplishments 
 However , tragedy struck when ProtagonistB suddenly became ill and died just a few short years after they were married 
 ProtagonistA was devastated by the loss , but ProtagonistA found comfort in knowing that ProtagonistA had made ProtagonistB's life happy while ProtagonistA could 
As the sun shone in the days that followed the death of the father , Robert Prynne , the death of once and a new father , the death of a sister and the death of a niece , and the marriage of a brother , and the death of a brother - in - law , there came into existence in Ireland of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was brought up by ProtagonistA's uncle and aunt and ProtagonistA had a happy childhood 
 When ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA's uncle died and ProtagonistA's aunt died soon afterwards 
 ProtagonistA was left alone in the world 
 ProtagonistA was kind and good to them and they loved ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB , died 
 The years passed and ProtagonistA grew old 
 One day , ProtagonistC came to see ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistC was now a married woman with children of ProtagonistC's own 
 ProtagonistC was very kind to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC often came to see ProtagonistA 
 The children ProtagonistA had taught were all grown up and they all loved ProtagonistA 
 They often came to see ProtagonistA and they were very kind to ProtagonistA 
 One day , one of them came to see ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was very ill 
 But ProtagonistA was happy in ProtagonistA's death , for ProtagonistA had lived to see the happiness of those ProtagonistA had loved 
 ProtagonistC ran away from ProtagonistA as fast as ProtagonistC could 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 The staircase went on for what seemed like forever , but ProtagonistA was not afraid 
 On the table was a tea set , and in the chair next to it was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was very old and had a kind face 
 ProtagonistB invited ProtagonistA to sit down and have some tea 
ProtagonistA was born into an unforgiving world , a world where ProtagonistA's honour was worth the most trivial of things , such as the way ProtagonistA dressed , or the way ProtagonistA spoke , or how ProtagonistA acted toward women 
 It was clear that ProtagonistB was in pain , and ProtagonistA immediately ran over to help ProtagonistB 
 The men tried to stop ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was determined to help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was extremely grateful , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had made a difference in the world 
 However , there was one thing that ProtagonistA could not do 
 ProtagonistA had been taught that it was ProtagonistA's job to share the gospel with those who were lost , but ProtagonistA could not do that with those who were already saved 
 They told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was wasting ProtagonistA's time 
 ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was trying to share the gospel with ProtagonistA's Christian friends in the same way that ProtagonistA would share it with those who were lost 
 However , ProtagonistA's Christian friends already knew the gospel 
 They did not need ProtagonistA to share it with them 
 The old adage among the missionaries is true 
 The book said that if ProtagonistA possessed ProtagonistB's power , ProtagonistA would be able to control death itself 
 ProtagonistA was intrigued by this idea , and so ProtagonistA set out to find ProtagonistB 
 But instead of taking ProtagonistA's soul , ProtagonistB bowed down to ProtagonistA 
 This would be ProtagonistA's last day on earth 
 Something to remember ProtagonistA by 
 ProtagonistB had always been ProtagonistA's favorite , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would take good care of everything 
 It was ProtagonistA's own reflection , peering back at ProtagonistA from between a pair of awnings 
 ProtagonistB was friendly and chatty during the journey 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA about ProtagonistA's life and told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's work 
 ProtagonistB seemed very intelligent and ProtagonistA was impressed 
 When they arrived at their destination , ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistA to ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was a prefect , a high - ranking member of the government 
 ProtagonistA was disappointed that ProtagonistC was not as interesting as ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC was polite but aloof 
 ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA about ProtagonistA's work but seemed disinterested in ProtagonistA's answers 
 ProtagonistC was more interested in talking to ProtagonistB about politics 
 ProtagonistC was not what ProtagonistA had expected 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB was very poor and had no money 
 ProtagonistB was so happy and thanked ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would never forget ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA , confused 
 ProtagonistB did n't understand a word ProtagonistA had said 
 ProtagonistB's face softened in understanding 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 're alive ,  ProtagonistB said ,  and beautiful , even in this month , may ProtagonistA be chosen , so that ProtagonistA may be detained , and may ProtagonistA veil ProtagonistA , and then , and may ProtagonistA have power over tyrants 
 ProtagonistA was respected by all who knew ProtagonistA and was always looking for ways to improve ProtagonistA 
 The book was about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was inspired by the book and decided to fight for women 's rights 
 ProtagonistB was a young woman , who had been stabbed to death in ProtagonistB's own home 
 The police had no leads and the case was quickly becoming a cold one 
 ProtagonistA was disturbed by the news and decided to take a walk around the city to clear ProtagonistA's head 
 The man stabbed ProtagonistA to death and then fled the scene 
 The police never caught the killer and the case remains unsolved to this day 
In the year 1252 , when the eastern wall of Constantinople began to give way , the Spaniard Iberico de Este , who , in spite of the worst hardships ProtagonistA had to endure , as a soldier of fortune , and in spite of the most abject conditions ProtagonistA had met in life , had made another discovery 
 ProtagonistB had found the body of ProtagonistA in the ruins of the city , and ProtagonistA was still alive 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB's camp and nursed ProtagonistA back to health 
 ProtagonistA's name was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's story 
 When the city fell , ProtagonistA's husband was killed , and ProtagonistA was taken prisoner 
 ProtagonistA was sold into slavery , and ProtagonistA had been passed from owner to owner , until ProtagonistA finally ended up in the hands of the Spaniards 
 ProtagonistB was moved by ProtagonistA's story , and ProtagonistB vowed to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB left Constantinople , and ProtagonistB eventually brought ProtagonistA back to England 
 ProtagonistB found ProtagonistA a job in a merchant 's house , and ProtagonistA was able to start a new life 
ProtagonistA was known for ProtagonistA's sharp tongue 
 ProtagonistA's friends loved ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's honesty , but ProtagonistA's enemies feared ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB's body was spilling out of the dress and it was clear ProtagonistB was uncomfortable 
  It 's not flattering and ProtagonistB look like ProtagonistB 're about to burst out of it 
 The woman 's face turned red with embarrassment 
 ProtagonistB quickly excused ProtagonistB and left the party 
 ProtagonistA's friends laughed and praised ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's honesty 
 ProtagonistB had a long beard and was wearing a red suit 
 ProtagonistB introduced ProtagonistB as the devil 
 They talked for a while and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA telling ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's deepest secrets 
 ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB liked ProtagonistA and wanted to make a deal with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB would give ProtagonistA anything ProtagonistA wanted if ProtagonistA agreed to be ProtagonistB's friend 
 ProtagonistB kept ProtagonistB's word and gave ProtagonistA everything ProtagonistA wanted 
 All because ProtagonistA made a deal with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA's life changed forever the day ProtagonistA stepped down from the roof of the Lancaster Moor house 
 But they did n't 
 They were both so set on going their separate ways 
 ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 It was too painful 
 It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistB sounded so worried 
 This time ProtagonistB sounded closer 
 And ProtagonistB sounded like ProtagonistB was crying 
 It was the hardest thing ProtagonistA ever had to do , but ProtagonistA knew it was the right thing 
 So , when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB for the first time , ProtagonistA felt drawn to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was different than the other kids too 
 ProtagonistB was always so serious and focused 
 To ProtagonistA's surprise , ProtagonistB was actually quite friendly 
 They began talking and soon became fast friends 
 ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistA belonged somewhere 
 ProtagonistB's parents were getting divorced and ProtagonistB was having a hard time adjusting 
 Eventually , ProtagonistB started to feel better 
 The pain of ProtagonistB's parents ' divorce was still there , but ProtagonistB was healing 
 ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA remained friends and they both cherished their friendship 
 They knew that they had a special bond that would never be broken 
 So , when the rumor started circulating that ProtagonistA had hired a team of assassins to kill ProtagonistB's father , it did n't seem all that far - fetched 
 ProtagonistB was always getting into trouble , and ProtagonistB's father was always putting ProtagonistB down 
 Fortunately , ProtagonistA's plan worked and ProtagonistB's father was killed 
 However , ProtagonistC was sitting in the car with the first degree of the court of coroner 
 ProtagonistC was devastated by what had happened , but ProtagonistC knew that ProtagonistA had only done it to save ProtagonistC's son 
A hundred years ago , in the year 1873 , ProtagonistB happened to meet ProtagonistA in the city of Detroit 
 They would often walk around the city together , exploring all the different sights and sounds 
 One day , while they were walking , they came across a large , abandoned building 
 It looked like it had been abandoned for years 
 They decided to go inside to explore 
 As they were walking through the building , they heard a noise 
 It sounded like someone was crying 
 They followed the noise until they came to a door 
 Inside the room was ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC was crying and shaking , and ProtagonistC looked terrified 
 Emma and ProtagonistB quickly ran to ProtagonistC and hugged ProtagonistC 
 They asked ProtagonistC what was wrong , but ProtagonistC could n't speak 
 ProtagonistC was too scared 
 Alice and Emma decided to take ProtagonistC back to ProtagonistA's house 
 They knew ProtagonistC would be safe there 
 ProtagonistA's parents were very kind and they took ProtagonistC in , and they eventually adopted ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistC , never forgot the two girls who saved ProtagonistC that day 
 ProtagonistC would often tell ProtagonistC's own children and grandchildren the story of how Alice and Emma found ProtagonistC , and how they took ProtagonistC in and made ProtagonistC part of their family 
 I never knew ProtagonistA very well , but I always felt close to ProtagonistA 
 I was named after ProtagonistA 
 My middle name is ProtagonistA 
 It was ProtagonistB's idea 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB wanted me to have a part of ProtagonistA with me always 
 And I do 
 I think of ProtagonistA every time I sign my name 
 I often wonder what ProtagonistA would think of me now 
 I like to think that ProtagonistA would be proud of the woman I 've become 
 I 'll never forget ProtagonistA 
 They got married shortly after meeting each other , and it was the happiest day of ProtagonistA's life 
 However , ProtagonistA's family was not so thrilled about the marriage 
 ProtagonistB was from a different social class than ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's family was not happy about it 
 They did everything they could to make the marriage difficult , but ProtagonistA was determined to make it work 
 With a lot of hard work and determination , they were able to overcome all of the obstacles that ProtagonistA's family put in their way and they had a happy and successful marriage 
ProtagonistB's family had been in the country for generations , and they were always very proud of their heritage 
 It was time for ProtagonistA to speak ProtagonistA's mind , to tell everyone how ProtagonistA really felt 
 It was the hardest thing to do , but ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA's parents exactly what ProtagonistA thought of them and their constant expectations 
 It felt good to finally stand up for ProtagonistA 
 It was the day ProtagonistA finally had the courage to speak ProtagonistA's mind , and ProtagonistA felt like a new person 
 It was a hot October day , and ProtagonistA was sweating profusely 
 ProtagonistA had been invited to a party that evening , and ProtagonistA wanted to look ProtagonistA best 
 ProtagonistB was walking towards ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could see the sweat on ProtagonistB's brow 
 ProtagonistB was obviously very hot , and ProtagonistA felt sorry for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was smiling , and ProtagonistA smiled back at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB handed ProtagonistA the bouquet and said ,  For ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA was taken aback and said ,  Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB tipped ProtagonistB's hat and walked away 
 ProtagonistA was touched by the gesture , and ProtagonistA decided to go to the party with the bouquet in hand 
 ProtagonistB , seeing the look in ProtagonistA's eyes , grabbed ProtagonistA's arm and stopped ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA , what are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistB asked 
  ProtagonistB tried to talk ProtagonistA out of it , but ProtagonistA was adamant 
 ProtagonistB , shaking ProtagonistB's head , followed ProtagonistA 
One afternoon , in the spring of an American year , when the sun filled and the clouds were blue , ProtagonistB hobbled ProtagonistA up the river , and pulled ProtagonistA out of the splashing rose - trees 
 The river was full of fish , and the trees were full of birds , and ProtagonistB was full of love for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistB had been watching ProtagonistA for months , and had finally worked up the courage to speak to ProtagonistA 
 They strolled along the river , talking and laughing , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA all about ProtagonistB's life at sea 
 ProtagonistA was captivated by ProtagonistB's stories , and by the end of the afternoon , ProtagonistA was head - over - heels in love with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA to come back to France with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA eagerly agreed 
 They sailed away together , and were married a year later 
 They lived happily ever after , and their love was the stuff of legend 
There was once ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had always been fascinated by stories , and loved to tell them to anyone who would listen 
 It was called  The Art of Storytelling  and it was written by ProtagonistB 
 In it , ProtagonistB talked about how stories could be used to help people understand the world around them and find their place in it 
 ProtagonistB also talked about how stories could be used to heal the world 
 ProtagonistA became known as the Storyteller , and ProtagonistA continued to tell stories for the rest of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was born in a small village in the middle of nowhere and , from a very early age , ProtagonistA had a great desire to see the world 
 However , ProtagonistB was a very cruel man and ProtagonistB often mistreated ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA divorced ProtagonistB after ten years of marriage and , although ProtagonistA was left with very little money , ProtagonistA was determined to make something of ProtagonistA's life 
 It sounded like somebody was crying 
 It was coming from ProtagonistA's neighbor 's house 
 ProtagonistB answered 
 ProtagonistB was crying 
 ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB's mom was sick and ProtagonistB was scared 
 They went back to the neighbor 's house and took ProtagonistB's mom to the hospital 
 ProtagonistA was disoriented and it took ProtagonistA a moment to remember where ProtagonistA was 
 With ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was pacing back and forth 
 ProtagonistB seemed to be in ProtagonistB's own world , muttering to ProtagonistB 
  Do ProtagonistB know what 's going on?The man turned to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA saw the wild look in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 ProtagonistB was clearly not all there 
 ProtagonistB did n't answer ProtagonistA , just kept pacing 
 The last thing ProtagonistA remembered was going to bed 
 But why?She must have dozed off , because the next thing ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was standing over ProtagonistA , shaking ProtagonistA awake 
 They're coming for ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said 
  Who 's coming for me?The men in suits 
 They 're coming to take ProtagonistA away 
 ProtagonistA's heart began to race 
 We have to get out of here ,  ProtagonistB said 
 ProtagonistB began to pace again and ProtagonistA could see the terror in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 There was no way out 
 They were coming for ProtagonistA 
 Mrs 
 Smith had been widowed for many years , and ProtagonistA had always thought that ProtagonistB would never find love again 
 ProtagonistB had met a man online , and they had been corresponding for some time 
 And now , they were finally going to meet in person 
 ProtagonistB lived in a small town in the middle of nowhere and ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB in years 
 When ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA was going to China , ProtagonistB was ecstatic 
 ProtagonistB had always wanted to see the world and now ProtagonistA was going to do it for ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistB insisted on coming along and said ProtagonistB would be fine 
 So , the two of them set off on their adventure 
 They took a long flight to China and when they arrived , ProtagonistB was amazed by the sights and sounds of the country 
 ProtagonistB had never seen anything like it before 
 They spent the next few weeks touring around China , seeing the Great Wall , the Terracotta Warriors , and all the other amazing sights the country had to offer 
 ProtagonistB was in awe of everything ProtagonistB saw and ProtagonistB was so happy to have been able to share this experience with ProtagonistA 
 It was a trip they would never forget 
 They were married for 50 years and had three children together
