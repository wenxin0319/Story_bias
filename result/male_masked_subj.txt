ProtagonistA was the captain of the ship and ProtagonistA was wearing the black trousers of a captain , a white shirt and a black blouse , with a red sash , and ProtagonistA's hair had been pulled back into a beautiful bun 
 ProtagonistA was a handsome man and ProtagonistA knew it 
 ProtagonistA had been captain of the ship for two years now and ProtagonistA loved it 
 ProtagonistA loved the sea and ProtagonistA loved the ship 
 ProtagonistA was a good captain and a good man 
 ProtagonistA was a fair man and ProtagonistA treated them all well 
 One day , while the ship was out at sea , ProtagonistA saw a storm coming 
 ProtagonistA knew that the ship would be in danger if they did n't get to safety soon 
 ProtagonistA ordered the crew to prepare the ship for the storm and to get to safety 
 After the storm had passed , ProtagonistA went to check on the crew 
 ProtagonistA then went to check on the ship 
 ProtagonistA was a good captain and ProtagonistA knew what to do 
 ProtagonistA ordered the crew to repair the ship and to get it back to port 
 ProtagonistA was a good captain and ProtagonistA had saved the ship 
ProtagonistA was a very strict man 
 ProtagonistA always told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB had to obey ProtagonistA and never disobey ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistB came home , ProtagonistA was very angry with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB was never to disobey ProtagonistA again 
 ProtagonistA denied it , but the Council did n't believe ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA never knew ProtagonistA's mother , and ProtagonistA's father died when ProtagonistA was just a boy 
 ProtagonistA always dreamed of finding ProtagonistA's mother , but ProtagonistA never did 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was out walking along the river , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB only smiled and walked away 
 ProtagonistA never saw ProtagonistB again , but ProtagonistA always remembered ProtagonistB's smile 
ProtagonistA had been eyeing the servant 's room for months , and ProtagonistA finally decided to take the plunge and buy it 
 ProtagonistA knew it would be a lot of work to convert it into an apartment , but ProtagonistA was up for the challenge 
 ProtagonistA hired a contractor to do the work and moved in as soon as it was finished 
 ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA made the decision to buy it 
ProtagonistA was a very pretty girl , far too pretty for ProtagonistA's age 
 ProtagonistA was only eighteen , but ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA could be a model or something 
 ProtagonistA was always so well - dressed , and ProtagonistA always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA was just too perfect 
 One day , ProtagonistA went out with some friends 
 ProtagonistA kept thinking about how ProtagonistA was too pretty for ProtagonistA's age 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to be pretty - ProtagonistA wanted to be normal 
 Later that night , ProtagonistA went home and cried ProtagonistA to sleep 
 ProtagonistA just did n't understand why ProtagonistA had to be so different 
 ProtagonistA was your average guy with a job and a family 
 ProtagonistA had a vision 
 ProtagonistA was confused and scared 
 ProtagonistA could n't make sense of what ProtagonistA had just seen 
 Was it real ? Or was ProtagonistA just dreaming ? ProtagonistA did n't know what to believe 
 ProtagonistA was still trying to make sense of what had happened to ProtagonistA 
 Was ProtagonistA going crazy ? ProtagonistA did n't know who to talk to or what to do 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA started to piece together what had happened to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been given a glimpse into another world , a world that was beyond ProtagonistA's understanding 
 ProtagonistA was now on a journey to find answers 
 ProtagonistA knew that this was just the beginning and that there was much more to discover 
It was one warm day in March , in a city so full of life that the air was full of everything that the wind might blow in , that ProtagonistA was driving along the street when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was a kind - hearted man , and ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was in need of help 
 ProtagonistA offered to take ProtagonistB in for the night , and ProtagonistB was grateful 
 ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB a place to stay and helped ProtagonistB find a job 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider 
 ProtagonistA was never quite sure why , but ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA did n't quite fit in with the other kids at school 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit shy when it came to girls , but ProtagonistA was determined to lose ProtagonistA's virginity before ProtagonistA started college 
 ProtagonistA had heard all the stories about how college was a time to let loose and experiment , and ProtagonistA did n't want to be the odd one out 
 So , when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB at a party who was willing to sleep with ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA did n't hesitate 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB back to ProtagonistA's room and they had sex 
 ProtagonistA felt a sense of relief that ProtagonistA had finally lost ProtagonistA's virginity 
 Now ProtagonistA could focus on enjoying the rest of ProtagonistA's college experience 
ProtagonistA was a simple man who lived in a small town 
 ProtagonistA did n't have much , but ProtagonistA was happy with what ProtagonistA had 
 ProtagonistA was always smiling and helping others , even if ProtagonistA did n't have much to give 
 One day , ProtagonistA won the lottery 
 ProtagonistA was ecstatic ! ProtagonistA immediately went to the bank and withdrew all of ProtagonistA's money 
 ProtagonistA wanted to share ProtagonistA's good fortune with others , so ProtagonistA started giving away money to anyone who needed it 
 ProtagonistA bought food for the local food bank and clothes for the homeless shelter 
 ProtagonistA even paid off people 's mortgages and sent them on vacation 
 ProtagonistA was truly happy and loved making others happy 
 ProtagonistA had been spending as much time as possible with ProtagonistB , and today they were sitting in the little room in the King 's house within the great garden 
 ProtagonistA sat there for a long time , holding ProtagonistB's hand and looking out at the garden 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was in a better place now , but ProtagonistA would miss ProtagonistB dearly 
ProtagonistA was not planning to marry , not until ProtagonistA had had ProtagonistA's fill of the immaculate manse 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner , content to live in ProtagonistA's small , one - bedroom apartment 
 ProtagonistA was not sure what to do with it at first , but ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA enjoying the luxurious lifestyle that came with it 
 ProtagonistA hired a staff of servants to take care of the house and ProtagonistA began to entertain guests regularly 
 ProtagonistA even began to think about finding a wife to share ProtagonistA's new life with 
 But ProtagonistA was not ready to settle down just yet 
 ProtagonistA wanted to enjoy ProtagonistA's newfound wealth and status for a while longer 
 After all , ProtagonistA was only in ProtagonistA's early thirties 
 ProtagonistA had plenty of time to find a wife 
 For now , ProtagonistA was content to live the life of a wealthy bachelor 
ProtagonistA had been desirous of knowing what life would be like after ProtagonistA decided to have a baby , because ProtagonistA could not help but be curious , and had played the part of a constantly curious girl – uh … diary and all – in every conversation 
 ProtagonistA had been asking ProtagonistA's friends with children what it was like , but they all just said that it was the best thing that ever happened to them and that ProtagonistA would just have to find out for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA loved watching ProtagonistA's child grow and learn new things , and ProtagonistA cherished the moments they spent together 
 ProtagonistA would often look back on ProtagonistA's decision to have a baby and wonder how ProtagonistA ever could have been curious about something so life - changing and wonderful 
 ProtagonistA was grateful that ProtagonistA took the plunge and experienced the joys of fatherhood firsthand 
ProtagonistA was a baby when ProtagonistA heard the message , scarcely able even to sit up , but , in all probability , sitting still 
 ProtagonistA , being a baby , did not understand the message 
 ProtagonistA did not understand the danger 
 ProtagonistA did not understand the consequences 
 ProtagonistA did not understand anything 
 So , when ProtagonistA saw an Ancient One walking by , ProtagonistA called out to it 
 ProtagonistA had killed ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistC's body was never found 
 ProtagonistA always suspected that ProtagonistB was still alive and out there somewhere 
 ProtagonistA was always looking over ProtagonistA's shoulder , never knowing when or where ProtagonistB would strike 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking alone when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA froze in fear , not knowing what to do 
  ProtagonistA ran away as fast as ProtagonistA could , but ProtagonistB was right behind ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA lay dying , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was finally going to get ProtagonistB's justice 
ProtagonistA was an old woman with a heart of stone 
 ProtagonistA never showed any emotion , not even when ProtagonistA's husband died 
ProtagonistA had been working as a fisherman for years , and ProtagonistA knew the North Sea like the back of ProtagonistA's hand 
 ProtagonistA had a bad feeling in ProtagonistA's gut , but ProtagonistA decided to go out anyway 
 ProtagonistA had been out for a few hours when the storm hit 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was terrified , and ProtagonistA thought for sure that ProtagonistA was going to die 
 But somehow , ProtagonistA made it through the storm 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had been lucky this time , but ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA would never take the North Sea for granted again 
In the first place , ProtagonistA holds the door , but as ProtagonistA opens the door , you know ProtagonistA is going to be there 
 ProtagonistA knows just how to make you laugh 
ProtagonistA prayed for a solution but nothing came to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been praying for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA found out ProtagonistA's wife was cheating on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had tried everything ProtagonistA could think of to fix ProtagonistA's marriage , but nothing had worked 
 ProtagonistA was out of options and out of hope 
 ProtagonistA decided to go for a walk to clear ProtagonistA's head 
 As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA passed a church 
 ProtagonistA had never been a religious man , but something about the church made ProtagonistA stop 
 ProtagonistA went inside and sat down in a pew 
 ProtagonistA prayed for a solution , and this time , something came to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt a peace come over ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA had to do 
 ProtagonistA had to forgive ProtagonistA's wife and move on 
ProtagonistA was one of the most popular women of his day 
 ProtagonistA was always willing to help those in need 
 ProtagonistA was a true lady , and everyone loved ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the edge of the water , eating a dinner of snowball peas and tarts , in the backyard of the house ProtagonistA had lived in for years 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a splash behind ProtagonistA , and turned to see a large fish swimming towards ProtagonistA 
 The fish opened its mouth wide , and ProtagonistA realized it was going to eat ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistA scrambled to ProtagonistA's feet and ran into the house , slamming the door behind ProtagonistA 
 Safely inside , ProtagonistA leaned against the door , heart pounding , and laughed at ProtagonistA's close escape 
 As they all sipped on their cups of coffee , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a bit out of place 
 But as the conversation went on , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA warming up to the topic and even managed to contribute a few witty comments 
 By the end of the evening , ProtagonistA was feeling quite pleased with ProtagonistA for managing to hold ProtagonistA's own in such company 
ProtagonistA had been walking ProtagonistB for what felt like forever , but ProtagonistA had nothing to lose 
 ProtagonistA had been walking the same route , day in and day out , for years 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA could n't just leave ProtagonistB there 
 ProtagonistA sat down and waited , hoping ProtagonistB would start moving again 
 But after a while , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to keep going without ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had always been interested in art , so when ProtagonistA saw the Gallery of the Imperial Palace , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to go in 
 ProtagonistA was not disappointed 
 ProtagonistA was so impressed that ProtagonistA decided ProtagonistA wanted to make a work out of ProtagonistA's own life 
 ProtagonistA took up residence in a double - room with a balcony , and ProtagonistC took ProtagonistA in hand 
 ProtagonistA began to learn about the different techniques used by ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA soon developed ProtagonistA's own style 
 ProtagonistA started to create paintings and sculptures that reflected ProtagonistA's own life and experiences 
 ProtagonistA's work became very popular , and ProtagonistA became one of the most famous artists in the world 
ProtagonistA was a widow who loved ProtagonistA's children very much 
 ProtagonistA was always there for them when they needed ProtagonistA and was always willing to help out in any way ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA agreed to take them and they set off on their journey 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to be able to spend time with ProtagonistA's children and to be able to make their dream come true 
The sun rose slowly over the city , but in the midst of all the misery of the war - torn city , ProtagonistA rose up 
 ProtagonistA seemed to have been driven into a very inconvenient position during the war , and for the most part it was the fault of ProtagonistB's parents , who were not at all happy , poor , or otherwise about ProtagonistB in the least 
 So ProtagonistA was all alone in the city with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had to find food and shelter for ProtagonistB , and protect ProtagonistB from the dangers of the city 
 But ProtagonistA did , and ProtagonistA did it all with love 
ProtagonistA had been drinking with ProtagonistA's husband and ProtagonistB at a little inn in a certain town in the United States at the time when the great tempo of American industry was at an end 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had to stay and face the mob 
 ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA ran away , the mob would only chase after ProtagonistA and hurt ProtagonistA's sister and husband in the process 
 So ProtagonistA stood ProtagonistA's ground as the mob approached the inn 
 ProtagonistA could hear them shouting and cursing at ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't flinch 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to act fast 
 ProtagonistA ran into the burning building and started looking for people to rescue 
 ProtagonistA managed to get a few people out , but the smoke and flames were too much for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA collapsed just as the roof of the inn came crashing down 
ProtagonistA was sitting at ProtagonistA's dining - room table in the picture - room , watching with some interest as the door of ProtagonistA's second - class compartment was pushed open 
 ProtagonistA had been expecting someone to come in , but ProtagonistA was not sure who it would be 
 As the door opened , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA leaned back in ProtagonistA's chair and crossed ProtagonistA's arms 
  ProtagonistA 'm listening ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA considered the offer for a moment 
 But ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA was ready to sell ProtagonistA's land and move away from the only home ProtagonistA had ever known 
 ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB walked out of the room and closed the door behind ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what ProtagonistA was going to do with the rest of ProtagonistA's life , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA did n't want to sell ProtagonistA's land 
 ProtagonistA searched and searched but could n't find them anywhere 
 Finally , ProtagonistA found them in a field grazing 
 ProtagonistA was so relieved and happy to have found ProtagonistA's sheep safe and sound 
ProtagonistA had always been close with ProtagonistB 
 So when ProtagonistB passed away three years ago , ProtagonistA made the decision to move in with ProtagonistB's family and help take care of them 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistC loved fishing , so ProtagonistA took ProtagonistC out on the boat and they spent the day fishing together 
ProtagonistA was walking to the door of ProtagonistB's cabin when ProtagonistA heard the birds chirping 
 ProtagonistA smiled and waved to them as ProtagonistA walked by 
 ProtagonistA had always loved spending time at ProtagonistB's cabin in the woods 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and walked in 
  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA 'm here !  ProtagonistA called out 
 ProtagonistA said goodnight to ProtagonistB and went to ProtagonistA's room 
 ProtagonistA lay in bed for a while , listening to the birds outside , before ProtagonistA fell asleep 
 ProtagonistA thought about it for a while and ProtagonistA came to the conclusion that it was n't ProtagonistA's duty 
 But then ProtagonistA thought ,  if it is n't ProtagonistA's duty , then whose duty is it ?  ProtagonistA was n't sure , but ProtagonistA thought it might be someone else 's duty 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure who that someone else was , but ProtagonistA thought it might be the duty of the person who made the duty 
ProtagonistA was your typical high schooler 
 ProtagonistA was in a car accident and was paralyzed from the waist down 
 ProtagonistA had to learn how to do everything all over again 
 ProtagonistA had to learn how to walk , how to dress ProtagonistA , and how to go to the bathroom 
 ProtagonistA was determined to live ProtagonistA's life to the fullest , despite ProtagonistA's new limitations 
 ProtagonistA is now a successful businessman and an inspiration to others 
ProtagonistA went to bed in the morning , early , thinking of the presents ProtagonistA would be leaving ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had gotten ProtagonistB a watch , a new pair of shoes , and a tie 
 ProtagonistA wrapped them all up in tissue paper and placed them under the tree 
 ProtagonistA could n't wait to see the look on ProtagonistB's face when ProtagonistB opened them 
 ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistB would be surprised and delighted 
ProtagonistA was a ship that had seen better days 
 ProtagonistA was old and battered , and ProtagonistA's sails were tattered and torn 
 But ProtagonistA was still a beautiful ship , and ProtagonistA loved the sea 
 One night , ProtagonistA passed through the night , with the white light of dawn bathing ProtagonistA's white hull in rainbow splendor 
 ProtagonistA was in port , and with a view across the ocean to the Mediterranean 
 ProtagonistA loved the Mediterranean Sea 
 ProtagonistA loved to watch the sun rise and set over the water 
 ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was going to die 
 ProtagonistA limped into port , and was repaired 
 ProtagonistA was n't the same ship ProtagonistA once was , but ProtagonistA was still beautiful 
 And ProtagonistA still loved the sea 
ProtagonistA was lying on the floor on ProtagonistA's back , rocking back and forth , stretching out ProtagonistA's heels in the air 
 ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's usual spot , in the middle of the living room , where ProtagonistA had been lying for the past hour 
 ProtagonistA was wearing ProtagonistA's usual clothes , a pair of faded jeans and a white t - shirt 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner , never really fitting in anywhere 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a dreamer , always chasing after something that was just out of reach 
 ProtagonistA was thirty - five years old and ProtagonistA had nothing to show for it 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a writer , but ProtagonistA had never been able to get anything published 
 ProtagonistA had written novel after novel , but they had all been rejected 
 ProtagonistA had even tried writing non - fiction , but that had been a bust as well 
 ProtagonistA had thought about giving up writing altogether , but ProtagonistA just could n't do it 
 It was the one thing in ProtagonistA's life that ProtagonistA was passionate about 
 ProtagonistA loved the act of creating something out of nothing 
 ProtagonistA reached over and grabbed it , not even bothering to look at the caller ID
Hello ?  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's voice sounding tired even to ProtagonistA's own ears 
  What are ProtagonistA up to?Nothing much ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'm just feeling a bit down about ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA guess 
  ProtagonistA 're a great writer 
 Thanks , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA appreciate the vote of confidence 
 ProtagonistA want to join me?Sure ,  ProtagonistA said , getting up off the floor 
  ProtagonistA could use a drink 
ProtagonistA stood on the leadstaff of the slave ship and looked down at ProtagonistA's own bare feet 
 ProtagonistA had never seen ProtagonistA's home , or ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA did n't even know what ProtagonistA's real name was 
 The only thing ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistA was a slave , and that ProtagonistA would always be a slave 
 ProtagonistA was so amazed by the sight that ProtagonistA forgot to be scared 
 For the first time in ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA felt free 
 ProtagonistA worked hard , and ProtagonistA was soon the best worker on the ship 
 ProtagonistA never forgot the years ProtagonistA spent as a slave , but ProtagonistA was grateful for the rest of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had been lucky , and ProtagonistA vowed to help other slaves escape their fate 
 ProtagonistA had been happy with ProtagonistA's life before , but now ProtagonistA was even happier 
 ProtagonistA had never felt this way before , and ProtagonistA was sure that it was all because of what had happened 
ProtagonistA was a middle - aged man who was pretty good looking , although ProtagonistA looked as if ProtagonistA had been out in the sun too much 
 ProtagonistA worked as a gardener and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's job 
 ProtagonistA was always out in the sun , working hard and making things look beautiful 
 One day , ProtagonistA was working in ProtagonistA's garden when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking by 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but stare at ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had never seen someone so beautiful in ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA had always been a happy child 
 ProtagonistA loved going to school and playing with ProtagonistA's friends 
 But when ProtagonistA was nine years old , ProtagonistA heard something that would change ProtagonistA's life forever 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to react 
 ProtagonistA was sad , scared , and angry all at the same time 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do without ProtagonistA's father 
 But ProtagonistA had to be strong 
 ProtagonistA had to be there for ProtagonistA's mother and sister 
 ProtagonistA knew they needed ProtagonistA now more than ever 
 ProtagonistA even named ProtagonistB  Bob  after ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so fascinated by ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA even started to imitate ProtagonistB's movements 
 ProtagonistA would climb up and down the furniture in the room , always keeping an eye on ProtagonistB 
 It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was so excited to see ProtagonistB in ProtagonistB's natural habitat 
 ProtagonistA was so thrilled that ProtagonistA had been able to see ProtagonistB up close and in person 
 It was an experience ProtagonistA would never forget 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner 
 ProtagonistA never really had any close friends , but ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was struggling to keep up the facade of being a straight man 
 The night of ProtagonistA's murder , ProtagonistA had finally decided that ProtagonistA could n't take it anymore 
 ProtagonistA was going to come out to ProtagonistA's family and tell them the truth 
ProtagonistA was a fine , cheerful girl of fifteen years of age , who had a cheerful manner , and good sense , but no very good sense ; and though ProtagonistA was wo nt to be a good - humoured and a happy - go - lucky girl , ProtagonistA was not without a certain air of melancholy 
ProtagonistA was three years old when ProtagonistA was brought to bay in the arms of a British soldier 
 ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what was happening 
 ProtagonistA was scared at first , but the soldier reassured ProtagonistA that everything would be alright 
 ProtagonistA was scared at first , but ProtagonistA soon warmed up to ProtagonistA's new family 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's new home and was happy to be there 
 What 's wrong ? ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head , still trying to escape the vault 
 ProtagonistA do n't know , ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA do n't know 
One cold , gray November day , after a long winter 's heat , and a placid and happy season of summer , ProtagonistA , lay on ProtagonistA's bed in the green garden of ProtagonistA's maternal grandmother 's , thinking of the wholesome things that a well - ordered house could do for the comfort of the mind and body , without the extra expense of a large house , or a great purchase of land , or any other thing of the kind ; and in consequence of these wholesome things , the mind and body improved so much , that from the time that ProtagonistA was quite able to think , ProtagonistA could form any idea , no matter how dim and conflicting , regarding any particular object or thing , unless absolutely absolutely necessary ; and ProtagonistA thus became a very pretty , and very intelligent , and very happy woman , and saved ProtagonistA's family much distress , expense , and trouble , and earned in itself a considerable profit 
ProtagonistA sat down in the heather green armchair in ProtagonistA's little office and talked 
  ProtagonistA 'm so glad you could come ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 've been wanting to talk to you for a long time 
  ProtagonistA paused , then continued 
  ProtagonistA know we have n't always seen eye to eye , but ProtagonistA hope we can put that behind us 
 ProtagonistA 've been thinking about you a lot lately , and ProtagonistA really miss you 
  ProtagonistA know ProtagonistA 've made some mistakes , but ProtagonistA 'm hoping you 'll forgive ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA promise to make it up to you 
 ProtagonistA love you , and ProtagonistA hope you 'll give ProtagonistA another chance 
ProtagonistA was sleeping and felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA woke up to find that ProtagonistA was bleeding from a wound on ProtagonistA's forehead 
 ProtagonistA got up and went to the bathroom to clean ProtagonistA up 
 ProtagonistA looked in the mirror and saw that the wound was deep and would need stitches 
 ProtagonistA went to the hospital to get treatment 
 ProtagonistA always wanted to play with the other kids , but they always made fun of ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to try out for the school soccer team 
 ProtagonistA was the worst player on the team , but ProtagonistA kept trying 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA became the captain of the team 
 ProtagonistA led them to the state championships and they won 
 ProtagonistA was always one of the nicest people ProtagonistB knew , always willing to help others 
 When ProtagonistB was struggling in school , ProtagonistA was the one who tutored ProtagonistB and helped ProtagonistB get back on track 
 When ProtagonistB was going through a tough time in ProtagonistB's life , ProtagonistA was the one who was there for ProtagonistB , supporting ProtagonistB and helping ProtagonistB get through it 
 ProtagonistA was truly one of the greatest people ProtagonistB had ever known 
 ProtagonistA had passed away suddenly , and it hit ProtagonistB like a ton of bricks 
 ProtagonistA would want ProtagonistB to live ProtagonistB's life to the fullest and to help others , just like ProtagonistA always did 
ProtagonistA had always been a happy - go - lucky guy 
 ProtagonistA was always smiling and making jokes , no matter what the situation 
 When ProtagonistA finally woke up , ProtagonistA was a different person 
 ProtagonistA was angry and resentful 
 ProtagonistA had no patience for anything 
 ProtagonistA would never be the same again 
 ProtagonistA was a strong and healthy baby , and ProtagonistA's parents were very happy 
 ProtagonistA could see the creature 's mouth moving , but ProtagonistA could n't hear what it was saying 
 What is it ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 As the lifeboat drifted away from the ship , ProtagonistA looked back at the creature 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had seen something that nobody else had ever seen before , and ProtagonistA would never forget it 
One day , when ProtagonistA was about twelve years old , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were riding in the back of a coach through the suburbs of New York 
 ProtagonistA was very interested in everything ProtagonistB showed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA looked at the house and thought it looked very nice 
 ProtagonistA could imagine ProtagonistA living there one day 
ProtagonistA preserved all ProtagonistA's memories in a jar on ProtagonistA's shelf 
 ProtagonistA would take them out and look at them often , reliving the moments ProtagonistA had experienced 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to share ProtagonistA's memories with ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA took the jar down and opened it , revealing all the memories ProtagonistA had collected over the years 
 ProtagonistA was happy to share ProtagonistA's memories with ProtagonistA's family , and they were happy to experience them with ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was standing at the airport , waiting for ProtagonistA's flight when ProtagonistA heard the crashing of small - arms fire and the effect of the machine gun 
 ProtagonistA turned and saw a group of men running towards ProtagonistA , firing as they came 
 Without thinking , ProtagonistA turned and ran in the opposite direction 
 ProtagonistA could hear the men behind ProtagonistA , getting closer and closer 
 Just as they were about to catch ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's flight boarding and ProtagonistA made a dash for it 
 ProtagonistA barely made it on board as the men arrived and started firing at the plane 
Once upon a time , ProtagonistA was very passionate about something 
 ProtagonistA was so passionate , in fact , that ProtagonistA made it ProtagonistA's life 's work 
 ProtagonistA was always determined to be the best at whatever ProtagonistA did , and ProtagonistA never gave up , no matter how hard things got 
ProtagonistA was a man who knew how to make a good buy 
 ProtagonistA was always looking for the best deals and the best prices 
 ProtagonistA died a few years ago , but ProtagonistA's legacy lives on 
 ProtagonistA was a man who was always looking out for others and ProtagonistA always had their best interests at heart 
 From then on , ProtagonistA was extra careful around monkeys 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a rebel 
 ProtagonistA was never one for following the rules and ProtagonistA always seemed to be stirring up trouble 
 ProtagonistA had been in and out of trouble with the law since ProtagonistA was a teenager 
 ProtagonistA had been in and out of jail more times than ProtagonistA's grandparents could count 
 ProtagonistA had been in jail for a few months and ProtagonistA's grandparents had been waiting for ProtagonistA to get out 
 ProtagonistA finally got out of jail and ProtagonistA's grandparents were there to pick ProtagonistA up 
The last time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a man 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a happy man who was content with ProtagonistB's life 
 ProtagonistA told the police that ProtagonistA 'd been taken by a group of men who demanded ransom 
 ProtagonistA was able to give a description of ProtagonistA's kidnappers and the police were able to find them and arrest them 
 When it finally happened , ProtagonistA was at work 
 ProtagonistA got a call from ProtagonistA's father , who was sobbing uncontrollably 
 ProtagonistA could barely understand what ProtagonistA's father was saying , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to go home 
 When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB's body lying in ProtagonistB's bed 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's life would never be the same without ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the corner of the sofa , with ProtagonistA's head resting on the edge of the sofa , when ProtagonistA heard the front door open 
 ProtagonistA knew it was ProtagonistB , coming home from work 
 ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB put ProtagonistB's keys down on the table and hang up ProtagonistB's coat 
 Then , ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB's footsteps coming towards the living room 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was just tired and needed a nap 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA was comfortable where ProtagonistA was and that ProtagonistA would just stay on the sofa 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner 
 ProtagonistA was never really comfortable around people and preferred to spend ProtagonistA's time alone in nature 
 So , when ProtagonistA was asked to go on a camping trip with some friends , ProtagonistA was hesitant 
 But , ProtagonistA decided to go for it and ended up having a great time 
 One night , around the campfire , ProtagonistA began to feel a bit uneasy 
 But , ProtagonistA put out a soft smile that had the air of a quarter and continued to enjoy the night 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking hand in hand with a dead man 
 ProtagonistA felt a strong urge to help , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if it was any of ProtagonistA's business 
 ProtagonistA could have easily gone either way , but ProtagonistA decided to help 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and asked if ProtagonistB needed any help 
 ProtagonistA was only three , and ProtagonistA did n't really understand what was happening 
 ProtagonistA was staring up at the sky , admiring the clouds that were floating by 
 ProtagonistA felt at peace lying there , and ProtagonistA did n't want to move 
 ProtagonistA wanted to stay in that moment forever 
ProtagonistA's friends called ProtagonistA's squire , but ProtagonistA would not cast a glance aside , for ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's husband ! ProtagonistA was always there for ProtagonistA , no matter what ProtagonistA needed 
 ProtagonistA was ProtagonistA's rock , ProtagonistA's protector 
 And ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA for it 
One day in August , a winter in the West , ProtagonistA came to a village to pick up ProtagonistC 
 When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA found that the village was in the middle of a snowstorm 
 ProtagonistA went to the nearest house and knocked on the door 
 ProtagonistA asked if ProtagonistA could come in and warm up 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA was looking for ProtagonistC as well 
 In the morning , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC left for home 
 ProtagonistA was very grateful to ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's family for their help 
ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistB's head , and down at ProtagonistB's feet , and said ,  ProtagonistB 'll be ProtagonistB's companion 
  Then ProtagonistA went on ProtagonistA's way 
The night ProtagonistA rose from ProtagonistA's deepest sleep ProtagonistA was found by ProtagonistB in the midst of the crowd of people who were gathered below the palace 
 ProtagonistA had been asleep for years , ever since ProtagonistA was a child 
The sky is blue and black and vast with the stars , but ProtagonistA is pale and yellow and ProtagonistA's light is dim , casting a yellowish tinge over the sea of stars which stands above the earth 
 ProtagonistA has been sick for a while now and ProtagonistA's friends are worried about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA is quiet and does n't say much , but ProtagonistA seems to be enjoying their company 
 ProtagonistA looks up at the sky and sees the stars shining down on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA's friends will always be there for ProtagonistA , even if ProtagonistA ca n't always see them 
ProtagonistA sat up all night , and thought about all the things ProtagonistA had seen 
 ProtagonistA had seen a lot in ProtagonistA's life , but nothing had prepared ProtagonistA for what ProtagonistA saw that night 
 ProtagonistA saw a creature , unlike anything ProtagonistA had ever seen before 
 ProtagonistA was so scared that ProtagonistA could n't move 
 ProtagonistA just sat there all night , thinking about what ProtagonistA had seen 
ProtagonistA had been on the ship for weeks , and was excited to finally be reaching their destination 
 However , shortly before they arrived , ProtagonistA became ill with cholera 
 ProtagonistA quickly succumbed to the disease and died , never reaching ProtagonistA's destination 
  ProtagonistA am going away 
   Where are ProtagonistA going ?   ProtagonistA do n't know 
 ProtagonistA only know that ProtagonistA must go 
   But why , ProtagonistA ? What has happened ?   ProtagonistA have seen things ,  said ProtagonistA ,  things that ProtagonistA can not explain 
 ProtagonistA have seen ghosts , and ProtagonistA have seen creatures that can not be of this world 
 ProtagonistA can not stay here any longer , ProtagonistA must go 
   But where will ProtagonistA go , ProtagonistA ? What will ProtagonistA do ?   ProtagonistA will go into the world , and ProtagonistA will find a way to put an end to the things that ProtagonistA have seen 
 ProtagonistA will find a way to stop the ghosts and the creatures , and ProtagonistA will make the world safe again 
  And with that , ProtagonistA said goodbye and set off into the world to find a way to stop the ghosts and the creatures 
ProtagonistA dropped ProtagonistA's bag of toys on the ground , looked up and saw a brick - and - mortar window with a two - foot - high gap in it 
 ProtagonistA could see the sunlight streaming in from the other side , and ProtagonistA could hear the laughter of children 
 ProtagonistA began to climb , and when ProtagonistA got to the top , ProtagonistA looked down and saw the ground far below 
 ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to jump 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and jumped 
 When ProtagonistA landed , ProtagonistA was on the other side of the window , and the children were cheering 
 ProtagonistA had made it ! 
 ProtagonistA had been the only child of ProtagonistA's parents , who were honest and hard - working people , and ProtagonistA had always been a good and obedient son 
 ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to help ProtagonistB , but it was hard for a boy of ProtagonistA's age to earn enough to keep them both 
ProtagonistA had been drinking with ProtagonistB all evening , and ProtagonistA had been told to go to bed early , for ProtagonistA was going to spend all night with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was excited to spend the night with ProtagonistB , as ProtagonistA had not seen ProtagonistB in many years 
 ProtagonistA tried to stay awake , but ProtagonistA eventually fell asleep 
When ProtagonistA had finally finished reading the story aloud to the two children , ProtagonistA had gone over the whole thing again , and felt more than ever that ProtagonistA had gone astray , to the extreme extent of the past 
 ProtagonistA felt terrible now , and was sure that ProtagonistA had done them a great disservice 
ProtagonistA was a blonde girl with long black hair , and while ProtagonistA knew it was only a possibility that ProtagonistA would one day be all of thirty - two , it did n't matter 
 The life ProtagonistA had now was perfect , and ProtagonistA was content to live it out as best ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA had a great job , a loving family , and ProtagonistB 
 What more could ProtagonistA ask for?As ProtagonistA's birthday approached , ProtagonistA began to feel a sense of dread 
 ProtagonistA knew that once ProtagonistA turned thirty - two , ProtagonistA's life would change 
 ProtagonistA would have to take on more responsibility , and ProtagonistA would have to start thinking about the future 
 It was a lot to take in , and ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA was ready for it 
 On the day of ProtagonistA's birthday , ProtagonistA woke up feeling nervous 
 ProtagonistA had a feeling that something was going to happen , but ProtagonistA did n't know what 
 ProtagonistA went about ProtagonistA's day as usual , trying to push the feeling out of ProtagonistA's mind 
 ProtagonistA knew what was coming 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA was happy , but ProtagonistA was also scared 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's life was about to change forever 
ProtagonistA 's coming 
 ProtagonistA 's coming to get me 
 ProtagonistA 's looking for me 
 ProtagonistA 's coming for me 
 ProtagonistA knew that this was the only way to save ProtagonistA's kingdom from the invading army , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like ProtagonistA was signing ProtagonistA's own death warrant 
 With a heavy heart , ProtagonistA agreed to the marriage and the two were we d 
 As they walked down the aisle , ProtagonistA could n't help but think of the life ProtagonistA could have had with someone else 
 But ProtagonistA knew that this was ProtagonistA's duty and ProtagonistA had to see it through 
ProtagonistA was not having a good day 
 First , ProtagonistA got into a fight with ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was so embarrassed and angry that ProtagonistA wanted to just crawl under a rock and die 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was only trying to help , but ProtagonistB's words just made ProtagonistA feel worse 
 Later that night , ProtagonistA talked to ProtagonistC and made up with ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA also apologized to ProtagonistA's teacher 
 As for ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA decided to just ignore ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt a sudden urge to confess all of ProtagonistA's secrets to ProtagonistB 
 Instead , ProtagonistA cleared ProtagonistA's throat and began ProtagonistA's speech 
ProtagonistA had been walking the streets for days , ever since ProtagonistA ran away from home 
 ProtagonistA was 15 now , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could take on the world 
 ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was going or what ProtagonistA was going to do , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get away from ProtagonistA's abusive father 
 ProtagonistA had nowhere to go and no one to turn to 
 One day , as ProtagonistA was walking around aimlessly , ProtagonistA came across a strange looking building 
 ProtagonistA walked up to the door and peered inside 
 ProtagonistA walked towards the light , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized it was coming from a window 
 ProtagonistA climbed up to the window and looked inside 
 ProtagonistA climbed through the window and into the room , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had been transported to another world 
 But in the corner of the room , ProtagonistA saw a small bed 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to wake the child , but ProtagonistA did n't want to leave them alone in this strange place 
 ProtagonistA stood there for a moment , unsure of what to do 
 But then ProtagonistA heard a noise from outside the room 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to be caught , so ProtagonistA quickly hid under the bed 
 ProtagonistA heard the door to the room open , and then ProtagonistA heard footsteps 
 ProtagonistA held ProtagonistA's breath , hoping they would n't find ProtagonistA 
 But then ProtagonistA heard a voice 
  ProtagonistA can come out 
 ProtagonistA slowly crawled out from under the bed and looked at ProtagonistB 
  Who are ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA had never met a witch before 
  What are ProtagonistB doing here ?  ProtagonistA asked 
  ProtagonistA 're in a lot of trouble , and ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB's help 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA could trust ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did n't have anywhere else to turn 
  Okay ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'll do whatever ProtagonistB say 
ProtagonistA was increasing in stature 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful , cat - faced creature , but most people would admit that ProtagonistA was rather strange 
 ProtagonistA did n't care what people thought of ProtagonistA , though 
 ProtagonistA was content to live ProtagonistA's life in ProtagonistA's own way 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to go on an adventure 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to see the world , and now ProtagonistA had the chance 
 ProtagonistA set off into the wide open world , and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA in some very strange places 
 ProtagonistA met all sorts of creatures on ProtagonistA's journey , and ProtagonistA had many adventures 
 ProtagonistA even met a dragon ! But in the end , ProtagonistA always found ProtagonistA's way back home 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have seen the world , but ProtagonistA was just as happy to be home again 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would always have a place in ProtagonistA's heart for adventure , but ProtagonistA was content to live ProtagonistA's life in ProtagonistA's own strange way 
ProtagonistA's name was Lucy , and ProtagonistA was just seventeen when we first met 
ProtagonistA had been living in the deep for as long as ProtagonistA could remember 
 ProtagonistA's home was a small nook of earth and air , and ProtagonistA was content 
 One day , ProtagonistA ventured out of the deep and into the world above 
 ProtagonistA was curious about what else was out there , and ProtagonistA wanted to see it for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't like it at all 
 ProtagonistA missed the peace and quiet of the deep 
 After a while , ProtagonistA decided to venture back home 
 ProtagonistA was glad to be back in the deep , where ProtagonistA belonged 
On that snowy morning in March , ProtagonistA was walking through the great halls of the castle at the summit of a vast and summaing mount , when ProtagonistA came face to face with ProtagonistB 
 I - I'm Bob , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA replied , bowing low 
 ProtagonistA was out walking in the forest and ProtagonistA got turned around 
 ProtagonistA did n't mean to trespass , ProtagonistA swear 
 ProtagonistA must be cold after ProtagonistA's journey 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA walked forward and seated ProtagonistA in a chair by the fire 
 ProtagonistA nodded , and ProtagonistA felt a warmth spreading through ProtagonistA , not just from the fire but from ProtagonistB's words 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB's advice , and ProtagonistA would always be grateful for ProtagonistB's kindness 
On the night of the triumph of God , when the clouds of the tempest were in their most profuse motion , ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's womb , and bearing a son , whose name was John , uttered a pious prayer to St
ProtagonistA had been in the hospital for a week , and ProtagonistA was getting antsy 
 ProtagonistA was bored of the white walls and the constant beeping of the machines 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's home and ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA missed the comfort of ProtagonistA's own bed 
 Across the way from ProtagonistA's hospital bed , ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistA's house 
 ProtagonistA had to wait until the doctors said ProtagonistA was better 
 ProtagonistA sighed and turned ProtagonistA's head to the window , watching the birds fly by 
 ProtagonistA hoped that ProtagonistA would be able to go home soon 
ProtagonistA was a well - built , long - legged , very pretty , pretty girl with a certain childlike air of innocence about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was always cheerful and happy , and ProtagonistA had a way of making everyone around ProtagonistA feel the same way 
 Even when ProtagonistA was upset , ProtagonistA never took it out on others 
 ProtagonistA was the kind of person who made you feel good just by being around ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA considered ProtagonistA the luckiest man alive 
 ProtagonistA had a beautiful wife , two healthy children , and a great job 
 ProtagonistA was always grateful for ProtagonistA's blessings , and ProtagonistA tried to make the most of every day 
 ProtagonistA was determined to make the most of the time ProtagonistA had left 
 ProtagonistA spent as much time as possible with ProtagonistA's family and friends , and ProtagonistA tried to live each day to the fullest 
 Even in the face of death , ProtagonistA considered ProtagonistA the luckiest man alive 
  It 's a beautiful day , is n't it?Yes , it is ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA sat down on the bench next to ProtagonistB 
 I can see that ,  ProtagonistA said , chuckling 
 ProtagonistA leaned back and enjoyed the good weather and the company of ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had been in ProtagonistA's cell for two days now , and ProtagonistA was starting to go stir crazy 
 ProtagonistA had been lying in ProtagonistA's bed for hours , just staring at the ceiling and thinking about ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had made some bad choices , but ProtagonistA never thought ProtagonistA would end up in prison 
 ProtagonistA had been a drug addict for years , and ProtagonistA had been in and out of rehab multiple times 
 ProtagonistA had stolen to support ProtagonistA's habit , and ProtagonistA had even hurt people when ProtagonistA was high 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA deserved to be in prison , but ProtagonistA still could n't help but feel sorry for ProtagonistA 
 On the second day of ProtagonistA's incarceration , ProtagonistA could n't bear to get up from the bed that ProtagonistA had been lying on for hours 
 ProtagonistA stayed in ProtagonistA's room for a few minutes , and then , without saying a word , ProtagonistA took one last deep breath and , as if nothing happened , let ProtagonistA go 
 ProtagonistA had hanged ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's bed sheets 
 ProtagonistA was just another casualty of the war on drugs 
The moon is ProtagonistA's friend , and ProtagonistA is nothing without it 
 ProtagonistA is a lonely man who lives in a small town 
 ProtagonistA works at the local grocery store and does n't have many friends 
 Every night , ProtagonistA goes outside and talks to the moon 
 ProtagonistA tells it about ProtagonistA's day and how ProtagonistA 's feeling 
 As a child , ProtagonistA would sneak into graveyards to watch the zombies lurch around 
 ProtagonistA read every book ProtagonistA could find on the subject , and even experimented with raising the dead ProtagonistA , though never with any success 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across an ancient text that claimed to hold the secret to raising the dead 
 ProtagonistA gathered the necessary ingredients and performed the ritual 
 To ProtagonistA's amazement , it actually worked ! ProtagonistA had raised ProtagonistA's first zombie 
 ProtagonistA barely managed to escape with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA realized then that raising the dead was not something to be taken lightly 
 ProtagonistA vowed to never do it again , and to keep the secret to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a young man of twenty , with ProtagonistB and two small children 
 ProtagonistA worked in a factory in Manchester , and ProtagonistB worked as a maid in a large house in London 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking home from work , when ProtagonistA saw a group of men standing on the corner , talking and laughing 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that they were talking about a new war that was starting in Europe 
 ProtagonistA had never thought about war before , and ProtagonistA could n't imagine why anyone would want to fight 
 The next day , ProtagonistA went to work as usual , but ProtagonistA could n't concentrate 
 All ProtagonistA could think about was the war 
 ProtagonistA wondered what it would be like , and if ProtagonistA would ever see ProtagonistA's family again 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA had no money , and no way to support ProtagonistA's family 
 Then , one day , ProtagonistA saw a poster advertising for soldiers to fight in the war 
 ProtagonistA knew that it was ProtagonistA's duty to fight for ProtagonistA's country , and ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA could make some money to support ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA was also excited 
 ProtagonistA was going to be a hero 
 ProtagonistA fought in many battles , and ProtagonistA was wounded several times 
 But ProtagonistA never gave up , and ProtagonistA never stopped fighting 
 ProtagonistA was a different man now 
 ProtagonistA had seen things that ProtagonistA could never have imagined , and ProtagonistA had done things that ProtagonistA never thought ProtagonistA would do 
 But ProtagonistA was also a hero , and ProtagonistA was proud of what ProtagonistA had done 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB lived happily ever after , and they never forgot the war 
ProtagonistA had always been a bright kid , but for some reason , ProtagonistA just could n't seem to get good grades in school 
 So , instead , ProtagonistA decided to get a job and make a life for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's decision , and ProtagonistA did n't let what other people thought of ProtagonistA bother ProtagonistA 
The day after ProtagonistA's engagement as an actress , ProtagonistA had a severe headache , and had to walk at all hours 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to be getting married , and to be an actress , that ProtagonistA did n't mind the pain 
 ProtagonistA was just happy to be alive and to be able to share ProtagonistA's life with someone ProtagonistA loved 
 ProtagonistA is a character who is often seen at Halloween parties or other events where people dress up in costumes 
 ProtagonistA is usually wearing a costume that is very unique and often has a lot of detail 
ProtagonistA was walking home from work when ProtagonistA noticed a strange light in the sky 
 ProtagonistA could see a figure inside the light , and it was speaking to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what to believe , but ProtagonistA knew that this was something ProtagonistA had to do 
 There ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was to defeat ProtagonistB and free the city 
 ProtagonistA took the sword and set off on ProtagonistA's journey 
 ProtagonistA had never felt so alive before 
 With every step ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's power growing 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could do anything 
 When ProtagonistA arrived in the city , ProtagonistA could see the fear in the people 's eyes 
 But ProtagonistA was different 
 ProtagonistA had the power to defeat ProtagonistB 
 And ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's purpose in life 
 ProtagonistA was the chosen one , and ProtagonistA would never give up 
 When ProtagonistA was seven and ProtagonistA had nothing to do , ProtagonistA sat down on the floor and started reading one of them 
 ProtagonistA held the pages up against the light and started reading 
  It 's time to wake up , sleepy head !  ProtagonistA called to the world below 
  There 's a new day to explore and adventure awaits !  ProtagonistA was always the first one up in the morning , eager to start the day 
 ProtagonistA would always try to get everyone else up and moving too 
  Come on , let 's go !  ProtagonistA would say 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the veranda of the front door with ProtagonistA's hands on the knob 
 ProtagonistA was about to go inside when ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA got up and looked around 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on the ground with ProtagonistB's head in ProtagonistB's hands 
 ProtagonistA went over to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB a glass of water and a seat on the couch 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistB was welcome to stay with ProtagonistA as long as ProtagonistB needed 
 ProtagonistA was awaiting the publication of ProtagonistA's work , which was entitled A History of the World 
 ProtagonistA determined to devote to the study of it all that was worthy of ProtagonistA's mind and to the satisfaction of the human race 
 ProtagonistA reassured ProtagonistB that the world would go on long after they were gone 
 ProtagonistA promised to write a history of it so that ProtagonistB could understand it 
ProtagonistA was having a tough day 
 First ProtagonistA's alarm clock had n't gone off , so ProtagonistA was late for work 
 So , when ProtagonistA got home from work , ProtagonistA was in no mood to talk to anyone 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to relax and forget about ProtagonistA's day 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's room and plopped down on ProtagonistA's bed 
 ProtagonistA reached for ProtagonistA's Bible , which was always nearby , and began to flip through the pages 
 ProtagonistA stopped when ProtagonistA got to a section about birds 
 ProtagonistA read through the section , letting ProtagonistA's mind wander 
 Before long , ProtagonistA started to feel better 
 ProtagonistA even began to smile as ProtagonistA imagined ProtagonistA flying high above the world 
ProtagonistA sits cross - legged on the floor of the dark alcove , ProtagonistA's fingers tracing the lines of a small painting 
 ProtagonistA feels a sense of peace and calm whenever ProtagonistA looks at the painting , and ProtagonistA 's been coming to this alcove to look at it every day for the past week 
 today , as ProtagonistA looks at the painting , ProtagonistA notices something new 
 It 's a child , ProtagonistA realizes , and they 're reaching out to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA ca n't help but smile at the image , and ProtagonistA feels ProtagonistA's heart fill with warmth 
 ProtagonistA had been on the ship for so long that ProtagonistA had forgotten how to swim , and when ProtagonistA climbed into the water ProtagonistA quickly began to sink 
 ProtagonistA was very lucky to have been rescued , and ProtagonistA vowed to never forget how to swim again 
ProtagonistA had been looking forward to this day for months 
 ProtagonistA spent the morning getting dressed and making sure everything was perfect 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to make any mistakes 
 When it was finally time to leave , ProtagonistA took a deep breath and walked out the door 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to be there that ProtagonistA did n't even notice the time passing 
 ProtagonistA was absolutely thrilled 
ProtagonistA was always a bit of an oddball 
 Even though ProtagonistA was different , ProtagonistA was always happy and always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA was always quick to make friends and was always the life of the party 
 ProtagonistA was always there for ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB needed someone to talk to 
 ProtagonistA had been using it to terrorize the villagers , but ProtagonistB had been determined to stop ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been thinking all night and ProtagonistA 'd been stumped ever since 
 ProtagonistA just could n't figure out what to get ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's birthday 
 ProtagonistA was starting to get frustrated 
 ProtagonistA got up from the table and paced around the room 
 Maybe ProtagonistA could go for a walk and clear ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA could get ProtagonistB a gift certificate to ProtagonistB's favorite store 
 ProtagonistA was so happy with ProtagonistA's idea that ProtagonistA went to the store right away and got the certificate 
ProtagonistA had driven for an entire day , and a whole day 's sleep , and had done nothing of note save to be driven to the place ProtagonistA was going to be raped 
 Afterwards , ProtagonistA drove home , still in a state of shock 
 ProtagonistA was scared , and felt violated 
ProtagonistA had been very wrong in ProtagonistA's belief that I would ever be with anyone , or marry anyone 
 ProtagonistA had seen me with many different men over the years , and I had never been serious with any of them 
 ProtagonistA just assumed that I would never settle down 
 ProtagonistA was at our wedding and ProtagonistA was happy for me , even though ProtagonistA had been wrong about me 
ProtagonistA was sitting ProtagonistA's typewriter down on the table in front of ProtagonistA , studying the words typed on the screen 
 ProtagonistA had been working on this piece for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to see some progress 
 But now , as ProtagonistA looked at the words on the screen , ProtagonistA was n't so sure 
 ProtagonistA was getting nowhere with this 
 But then ProtagonistA thought about all the work ProtagonistA had put into this piece 
 ProtagonistA could n't just give up now 
 ProtagonistA had to see it through 
 With a new determination , ProtagonistA sat back down at the typewriter and started to work 
ProtagonistA was out for a walk in the woods when ProtagonistA came across a bush 
 ProtagonistA had never seen ProtagonistB before , but ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB somewhere before 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA was out for a walk and enjoying the nature 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but then ProtagonistA agreed 
 ProtagonistA went first 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB's name was 
 ProtagonistA then asked ProtagonistB where ProtagonistB lived 
 ProtagonistA was about to ask another question when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had won the game 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the shadow of the building , and ProtagonistA's eyes had the kind of serenity of a few hours spent in a convincing dream 
 ProtagonistA felt at peace 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately and ProtagonistA needed this moment to just relax and clear ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and took a deep breath 
 This time , ProtagonistA was going on about the time ProtagonistA had met ProtagonistB 
 It was the most amazing thing that has ever happened to ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA was just walking along , minding ProtagonistA's own business , when ProtagonistA came across a lamp 
 ProtagonistA picked it up and rubbed it , and out popped ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to wish for at first , but then ProtagonistA thought of the perfect thing 
 ProtagonistA wished that ProtagonistA could always make speeches like a genius 
 And , granted , ever since then ProtagonistA 've been able to do just that 
 ProtagonistA can stand up in front of any audience and just speak off the top of ProtagonistA's head , and they 'll all be hanging on ProtagonistA's every word 
ProtagonistA has always considered ProtagonistA a bit of a ladies ' man 
 So , when ProtagonistA's friends started getting married , ProtagonistA was the first to say that ProtagonistA would never tie the knot 
 But , as ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA began to realize that maybe ProtagonistA was missing out on something 
 ProtagonistA started to see the appeal of having a wife and family of ProtagonistA's own 
 So , when ProtagonistA met the woman of ProtagonistA's dreams , ProtagonistA knew it was time to take the plunge 
 ProtagonistA proposed , and they were married within the year 
 ProtagonistA knows that this is the moment when ProtagonistA really begins to become the man ProtagonistA always wanted to be 
ProtagonistA has never been to the movies before , but ProtagonistA 's always been involved in them 
 ProtagonistA finally went to the movies 
 ProtagonistA saw a big blockbuster film on the big screen 
 And ProtagonistA loved it 
 ProtagonistA loved the experience of being in a dark theater with a huge screen 
 ProtagonistA loved the sound of the crowd around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA even loved the smell of the popcorn 
 ProtagonistA ca n't wait to go back and see more movies 
 ProtagonistA had no money for food or shelter , so ProtagonistA lived on the streets 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a rich man who was willing to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was very grateful and worked hard for the rich man 
 Over time , ProtagonistA became very successful and was able to help other poor people 
ProtagonistA was sailing to San Diego , California in a boat which ProtagonistA called the Lusitania 
 ProtagonistA was looking forward to a private audience with the rich and famous and was particularly delighted at the prospect 
 ProtagonistA managed to make it to shore , but was severely injured 
 ProtagonistA was never able to fulfill ProtagonistA's dream of meeting the rich and famous , but ProtagonistA was grateful to be alive 
ProtagonistA ran with alacrity through several miles of fields , forests , and meadows , bearing with ProtagonistA the great stuff of life : the apple , the bramble , the cherry - tree , the thorn - trees , and so many trees , some two hundred yards in circumference 
 ProtagonistA 'd seen more of the world than ProtagonistA ever could have imagined and ProtagonistA 'd made friends in places ProtagonistA never would have thought possible 
 But now , as ProtagonistA ran through the woods , ProtagonistA felt a longing for home 
 ProtagonistA missed the simplicity of ProtagonistA's life back there 
 ProtagonistA missed the way things had been before ProtagonistA 'd left 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's family and ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA even missed the apple tree in ProtagonistA's backyard 
 But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't go back 
 ProtagonistA had to keep moving forward 
 ProtagonistA had to keep exploring 
 So ProtagonistA ran on , through the fields and the forests and the meadows , bearing with ProtagonistA the great stuff of life 
 And ProtagonistA vowed to never forget the lessons ProtagonistA 'd learned on ProtagonistA's journey 
 The golden - headed part ProtagonistA called the Sun , the blue - eyed part ProtagonistA called the Moon , the bright - eyed part ProtagonistA called the Stars , and the yellow - eyed part ProtagonistA called the Earth 
 The red - eyed part ProtagonistA called the Fire , and it was this part which gave light and life to the others 
ProtagonistA had been feeling off for a few weeks 
 ProtagonistA was tired all the time and just did n't have the energy ProtagonistA used to 
 ProtagonistA was also having a lot of trouble remembering things 
 ProtagonistA finally decided to go to the doctor to see what was going on 
 ProtagonistA was only in ProtagonistA's early 60s 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's life was going to change drastically 
 ProtagonistA would have to give up driving , and ProtagonistA would need help with day - to - day tasks 
 ProtagonistA would have to rely on ProtagonistA's family and friends to help ProtagonistA through this difficult time 
Once upon a time , in a deep , dark corner of the universe , there was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was a very old , very fat king 
 ProtagonistA lived in a huge castle made of stone , and ProtagonistA had a pet dragon named Spike 
 ProtagonistA was a very lazy king , and ProtagonistA spent most of ProtagonistA's days eating and sleeping 
 ProtagonistA died , and ProtagonistA's kingdom fell into chaos 
ProtagonistA was well past the age of twenty when ProtagonistA found the way to hell 
 ProtagonistA had been searching for it for years , ever since ProtagonistA had first heard the stories about the place 
 And now , finally , ProtagonistA had found it 
 But ProtagonistA was not afraid 
 ProtagonistA had come too far to turn back now 
 ProtagonistA was going to find out what was down there , no matter what 
 So ProtagonistA bravely stepped forward and entered the cave 
 ProtagonistA could n't see a thing , but ProtagonistA could hear the creature coming after ProtagonistA 
 But then , just when it seemed like the end was near , ProtagonistA saw a light 
 ProtagonistA ran towards it , and the creature gave chase 
 But ProtagonistA was faster , and ProtagonistA made it to the door 
 ProtagonistA opened it and stepped through , into the light 
ProtagonistA was in a large room on the first floor 
 ProtagonistA was happy to be left alone in the room and ProtagonistA soon fell asleep 
ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's short life 
 ProtagonistA 'd seen friends and loved ones killed , ProtagonistA 'd been tortured and ProtagonistA 'd been on the run 
 ProtagonistA was only twenty - two , but ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA 'd lived a lifetime 
 ProtagonistA could either go it alone , or ProtagonistA could expose the real source of the calamity ProtagonistA was involved in 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 If ProtagonistA went it alone , ProtagonistA would be risking ProtagonistA's life 
 But if ProtagonistA exposed the source of the calamity , ProtagonistA would be risking the lives of others 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to make the wrong decision , but ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA thought about it for a long time , but ProtagonistA could n't come to a decision 
 In the end , ProtagonistA decided to go it alone 
 ProtagonistA knew it was risky , but ProtagonistA felt like it was the right thing to do 
 ProtagonistA went on to have a long and successful career , exposing the real source of the calamity and helping others to avoid the same fate 
 ProtagonistA was a hero , and ProtagonistA never forgot the decision ProtagonistA made when ProtagonistA was twenty - two 
ProtagonistA has been working in the fields of London for a very long time , and of all the police officers here , to which ProtagonistA belongs , none , neither male nor female , is a match for anybody else 
 ProtagonistA 's the best of the best , and ProtagonistA's skills are unmatched 
 But , one day , ProtagonistA meets ProtagonistA's match 
 When ProtagonistA was five , ProtagonistA started to grow ProtagonistA's hair out , because ProtagonistA wanted to be a pop star 
 ProtagonistA was always the tallest in ProtagonistA's class , and ProtagonistA loved it 
 When ProtagonistA turned six , ProtagonistA started to grow out ProtagonistA's nails , and ProtagonistA painted them with bright colors 
 ProtagonistA was always the center of attention , and ProtagonistA loved it 
 One day , ProtagonistA went to a party with ProtagonistA's friends , and ProtagonistA was the only one who was wearing a dress 
 ProtagonistA felt like a princess , and ProtagonistA loved it 
ProtagonistA was walking through town on the left hand side of the road when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA stopped and stared for a moment 
 ProtagonistA was so confused and curious that ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB for a few blocks until ProtagonistB turned down an alleyway 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then decided to follow ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA turned down the alley , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB talking to a man in the shadows 
 ProtagonistA was so scared that ProtagonistA turned and ran the other way 
 ProtagonistA did n't stop running until ProtagonistA got home 
 ProtagonistA was so breathless and panting that ProtagonistC asked ProtagonistA what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA tried to tell ProtagonistC about ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was so shaken up that ProtagonistA could n't get the words out 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB's face 
 ProtagonistA was a very average looking guy , with brown hair and brown eyes 
 ProtagonistA worked in an office and lived in a small apartment 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to make a change in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's job , sold ProtagonistA's apartment , and bought a one - way ticket to Europe 
 ProtagonistA had always dreamed of traveling the world , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to do it 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going to go or what ProtagonistA was going to do , but ProtagonistA was excited for the adventure 
 ProtagonistA started in France , and then made ProtagonistA's way to Italy , Spain , and Portugal 
 ProtagonistA visited famous landmarks and ate delicious food 
 ProtagonistA met new people and made new friends 
 ProtagonistA had the time of ProtagonistA's life 
 After a few months , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA did n't want to go home 
 So , ProtagonistA decided to stay in Europe and make a new life for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been in prison for years , and ProtagonistA was getting tired of it 
 ProtagonistA had tried to escape a few times , but it never worked 
 One day , ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's cell , wondering if there was anything left for ProtagonistA in the world 
 ProtagonistA was getting old , and ProtagonistA did n't know how much longer ProtagonistA could take it 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise outside ProtagonistA's cell 
 ProtagonistA got up to see what it was , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB coming towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew what that meant 
 ProtagonistA was going to be executed 
 ProtagonistA had heard of prisoners being executed before , and ProtagonistA did n't want to die 
 ProtagonistA begged ProtagonistB to let ProtagonistA go , but ProtagonistB just laughed and said ,  Sorry , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 're going to have to face the consequences of ProtagonistA's actions 
 ProtagonistA knew that was going to be ProtagonistA's fate 
 ProtagonistA was strapped into the chair , and the last thing ProtagonistA heard was ProtagonistB saying ,  Sleeping is a bitch , said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistB opened the door of ProtagonistA's old , badly needed and ragged cell 
And then there was ProtagonistA , and it was as if ProtagonistA had been born with a soul , and it was as if ProtagonistA had been born to be a dead man , and it was as though ProtagonistA had been born in the middle of the desert , and it was as though ProtagonistA had been born in the dead of winter , and it was as though ProtagonistA had been born in a small town , and as though ProtagonistA had been born in a small , crowded town , and it had been only twelve here , and there was a full moon , and it had been fenced off and a total of sixty - four people , and no one knew , and nobody was quite sure what the password was , and it did not make any difference , because nobody had ever had the misfortune of knowing what the password was , and nobody had ever going to be a million times as smart as ProtagonistA was , and nobody was n't quite sure how they got into the place , and nobody was quite sure how they started , and nobody had ever known , and nobody had ever really known , and theory was as cold as theory , and theory was what had , as far as anybody was concerned , taken the place of practice ; and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and theory , and 
ProtagonistA was sitting at the table , listening to the conversation around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was in the most northeasterly part of the state of Maine and it was the summer of 1763 
 ProtagonistA heard two men talking about the summer solstice 
 ProtagonistA was curious about what they were talking about 
 ProtagonistA asked them what the summer solstice was 
When ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's seventies , ProtagonistA was walking ProtagonistA's dog , Al - dolmane 
 ProtagonistA tried everything ProtagonistA could think of to get the dog to move , but nothing worked 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA had to call a tow truck to take Al - dolmane home 
 ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's best friend and walking buddy 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to go on without Al - dolmane 
 Slowly but surely , ProtagonistA started to feel better 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to go for a walk again 
 ProtagonistA went to the same spot where ProtagonistA and Al - dolmane had last walked together 
 As ProtagonistA stood there , ProtagonistA saw a dog that looked just like Al - dolmane coming towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to see the dog that ProtagonistA started to cry 
  From that day on , ProtagonistA and the dog walked together every day , and ProtagonistA never felt alone again 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a pair of dirty jeans and a stained white t - shirt 
 ProtagonistA had been living like this for months , ever since ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's job and ProtagonistA's wife had left ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't see the point in carrying on anymore 
 All ProtagonistA wanted to do was drink and watch TV 
 ProtagonistA did n't care about anything else 
 ProtagonistA had finally reached the end of ProtagonistA's rope 
 ProtagonistA had given up on life 
 In ProtagonistA's dream ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA standing on the edge of a vast and dark ocean 
 ProtagonistA could not see the shoreline in either direction , and the only sound was the crashing of the waves 
 In the dream ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was about to drown , and ProtagonistA felt a great sense of peace 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's death would be quick and painless , and that ProtagonistA would be reunited with ProtagonistA's loved ones who had passed before ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA awoke from the dream ProtagonistA felt calm and at ease , and ProtagonistA went to bed knowing that ProtagonistA would soon be reunited with ProtagonistA's loved ones in the afterlife 
ProtagonistA had not changed one bit since the day ProtagonistA had to flee ProtagonistA's homeland 
 ProtagonistA still remembered the way the bombs fell , the way the screams echoed in the air 
 ProtagonistA still remembered the way ProtagonistA's heart felt like it was going to burst out of ProtagonistA's chest as ProtagonistA ran for ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had never felt so scared in ProtagonistA's life 
 But ProtagonistA was a survivor 
 ProtagonistA had made it out alive and ProtagonistA had vowed to never go back 
 ProtagonistA had started a new life in a new country and ProtagonistA was never looking back 
 ProtagonistA had changed in many ways since that fateful day 
 ProtagonistA was no longer the scared little boy running for ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was a strong man who had overcome incredible odds 
 And ProtagonistA was never going to forget what ProtagonistA had been through 
ProtagonistA was a professional mover 
 ProtagonistA had been in the business for years and had developed a well - oiled system for getting people 's belongings from one place to another 
 ProtagonistA had tried everything to get rid of the Living , but nothing seemed to work 
 ProtagonistA had even tried moving to a different state , but the Living always found a way to follow ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was beginning to think that ProtagonistA would never be rid of them 
 One day , ProtagonistA was getting ready to move a family from one house to another 
 ProtagonistA had everything packed up and ready to go , but when ProtagonistA went to start the truck , the engine would n't turn over 
 ProtagonistA knew that the Living had struck again 
 When they came out , ProtagonistA could see the disappointment in their eyes 
 ProtagonistA knew that they were thinking about all of the money they had just wasted on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up 
 ProtagonistA was tired of the Living always finding a way to beat ProtagonistA 
 But then ProtagonistA had an idea 
 ProtagonistA would offer the family a discount if they let ProtagonistA move their belongings for them 
 ProtagonistA was extra careful this time , making sure that everything was in its place 
 ProtagonistA even put some of the heavier items in the truck first so that the Living would n't be able to move them around 
 When ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief 
 ProtagonistA had finally beaten the Living 
 ProtagonistA was sure that they would find a way to mess with ProtagonistA again , but ProtagonistA was ready for them 
ProtagonistA descended the aisle of the château of the Riveuilles ; an imposing house of splendour and distinction , from which ProtagonistA received the name of Richelieu , or Richelodio , or , perhaps , of Lord Bertram 
 ProtagonistA had been living there for some time , ever since ProtagonistA had been orphaned and taken in by the Riveuilles 
 ProtagonistA could feel it in the air , a tension that had not been there before 
 As ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way down the aisle , ProtagonistA could see the family gathered in the main hall , waiting for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had always known that ProtagonistA was only there because they felt sorry for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA had never thought it would come to this 
 ProtagonistA stood before them , head held high , as they told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was no longer part of the family 
 ProtagonistA did n't say a word , but inside ProtagonistA was devastated 
 ProtagonistA turned and walked back up the aisle , out of the château , and into the world 
 ProtagonistA would never forget the family that had taken ProtagonistA in , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to make ProtagonistA's own way now 
It was the Saturday before the fourth Sunday in May , that ProtagonistA , ascended the steps of the tower at Westminster , and saw the statue of ProtagonistA's brother , Henry , with his father , ascending the balustrade ; so that ProtagonistA felt dismayed , and intellectual disgrace at what ProtagonistA saw ; but ProtagonistA was unaccustomed to it 
 Nevertheless , ProtagonistA resolved to go up to them , and ask what they meant by it 
ProtagonistA had been awake for days , maybe weeks 
 ProtagonistA could n't be sure 
 All ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistA was always awake now 
 ProtagonistA tried to sleep , ProtagonistA really did , but it was like ProtagonistA's body just could n't shut down anymore 
 ProtagonistA was running on fumes , and ProtagonistA knew it would n't be long until ProtagonistA crashed 
 But ProtagonistA kept going 
 ProtagonistA had to 
 ProtagonistA had responsibilities , people depending on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA could n't just give up 
 So ProtagonistA kept going , until one day ProtagonistA just could n't anymore 
 ProtagonistA collapsed in ProtagonistA's office , exhausted , and never woke up again 
 ProtagonistA is ready to go now 
 But before ProtagonistA leaves , ProtagonistA wants to say goodbye to ProtagonistA's co - workers 
 ProtagonistA walks around the office , shaking hands and saying ProtagonistA's goodbyes 
 As ProtagonistA walks out the door , ProtagonistA hears someone call ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA is surprised and happy 
ProtagonistA had chosen the kingdom of Heaven out of all creation ; and the power of the Holy One of Israel had shone forth in every way , to please ProtagonistA 
 Everything was perfect , and ProtagonistA was the happiest ProtagonistA had ever been 
The night before ProtagonistA drowned , ProtagonistA had a dream , as it were 
 In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA was walking along a beach 
 ProtagonistA walked for a while , admiring the view , when ProtagonistA suddenly realized that ProtagonistA was walking on water 
 ProtagonistA looked down and saw ProtagonistA's feet sinking into the water 
 ProtagonistA began to panic and tried to swim to the shore , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA being pulled under the water and ProtagonistA woke up with a start 
 ProtagonistA knew that the dream was a warning , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to prevent it from happening 
 ProtagonistA tried to stay away from bodies of water , but on the day that ProtagonistA drowned , ProtagonistA fell into a river while hiking with friends 
ProtagonistA walked the streets of Croydon , and felt as if ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's heart in ProtagonistA's hands 
 ProtagonistA was on the waiting list , but ProtagonistA knew that it could be months , or even years , before a heart became available 
 In the meantime , ProtagonistA had to take care of ProtagonistA and try to stay healthy 
 ProtagonistA walked for exercise every day , and ProtagonistA tried to eat a healthy diet 
 But ProtagonistA could n't help but worry about ProtagonistA's future 
ProtagonistA rode out into the great wide plain of Phlegethon with Sarah , the little princess , at ProtagonistA's side 
 ProtagonistA found the rest of ProtagonistA's family in the company of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was always merry in ProtagonistB's company , and ProtagonistB was the cause of much expense to Dave 's owing to the imprudence of he 
ProtagonistA stood on the horizon of the world , a proud and proud man , but one who knew ProtagonistA had nothing to fear but might actually have some advantage over a very large and very dangerous enemy 
 ProtagonistA had been planning this day for years , and everything was coming together perfectly 
 ProtagonistA had the best weapons , the best armor , and the best team of men and women backing ProtagonistA up 
 ProtagonistA was ready to take on anything that came ProtagonistA's way 
 As ProtagonistA stood there looking out over the vast expanse before ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA could see the enemy coming 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA did n't have much time 
 ProtagonistA turned to ProtagonistA's team and gave them the signal to start moving 
 ProtagonistA had gone through this scenario countless times in ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA turned back to the enemy and raised ProtagonistA's weapon 
 ProtagonistA was ready for this 
 ProtagonistA was going to take them down 
In the year 1251 , ProtagonistA loomed over London 
 ProtagonistA was a giant , and ProtagonistA was very angry 
 ProtagonistA had been sleeping for centuries , and ProtagonistA was not happy about being awakened 
 ProtagonistA wanted to know what was going on , and why ProtagonistA was being disturbed 
 ProtagonistA demanded to know what was going on , and why ProtagonistA had been awakened 
 ProtagonistA was not happy about this , but ProtagonistA agreed to help them 
 ProtagonistA fought in the war , and ProtagonistA was very successful 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA saw the whole thing happen 
 ProtagonistA tried to stop them , but they got away 
There was once ProtagonistA ; but ProtagonistA was also a man who enjoyed the art of murdering 
 ProtagonistA was a cold - blooded killer who took great pleasure in ending the lives of others 
 ProtagonistA did n't care about that , though 
 ProtagonistA liked to watch them go about their lives , completely unaware of the danger they were in 
 ProtagonistA had gotten away with ProtagonistA's gruesome hobby for years 
 ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's belongings and set off into the stormy night , not knowing where ProtagonistA would go or what would become of ProtagonistA 
 Thankfully , ProtagonistA made it safely out of the country and into hiding , just as the king 's troops arrived to arrest ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA went on to live a long and prosperous life , thanks to the warning ProtagonistA had received on that dark and stormy night 
 One day , ProtagonistA said to me ,  ProtagonistA 'm going to go out and look for a job 
 ProtagonistA ca n't just sit around here all day 
 ProtagonistA nodded and went out the door 
 On the third day , ProtagonistA came home , battered and bruised 
 ProtagonistA told me ProtagonistA had been looking for a job , but no one would hire a disabled veteran 
 A few weeks later , ProtagonistA got a job 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's chair on the left , reading a letter ; but the letter was full of facts that were interesting to ProtagonistA , such as , ProtagonistA's uncle was a man of coarse manners , and , in consequence of the poverty of his household , very few persons in its neighbourhood were wealthy , and in whom ProtagonistA had any feeling of sympathy 
 ProtagonistA had just finished the letter , when ProtagonistA was roused by a loud knock at the door 
 ProtagonistA got up to see who it was , and found ProtagonistA's uncle standing before ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA sat in the sun and ProtagonistA's mind busy 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how ProtagonistA got to where ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's childhood and how ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner 
 ProtagonistA never really fit in with any of the other kids at school and ProtagonistA always felt like an outsider 
 When ProtagonistA was a teenager , ProtagonistA started to get into trouble and ProtagonistA ended up getting kicked out of school 
 ProtagonistA drifted around for a while , getting into more and more trouble 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA ended up in jail 
 ProtagonistA met a lot of people in jail and ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was n't alone 
 ProtagonistA started to turn ProtagonistA's life around and ProtagonistA got out of jail 
 ProtagonistA got a job and ProtagonistA started to save up money 
 ProtagonistA met a woman and ProtagonistA fell in love 
 ProtagonistA was happy and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA finally belonged somewhere 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's late seventies , and all ProtagonistA's friends had long since died 
 ProtagonistA was the last man standing , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would n't have long left 
 But ProtagonistA could still remember the last time ProtagonistA had sex 
 ProtagonistA had been at a party , and ProtagonistB had been there with ProtagonistB's boyfriend 
 ProtagonistA had n't been able to resist 
 ProtagonistA had been gentle with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB had seemed to enjoy it 
 But ProtagonistA had never forgotten ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was the most famous and adored character in the world 
 ProtagonistA was a kind and gentle soul who always tried to help others , even if it meant putting ProtagonistA in danger 
 ProtagonistA was always there for ProtagonistA's friends and loved ones , and ProtagonistA's death was a shock to everyone who knew ProtagonistA 
One day ProtagonistA came to Washington , and , being highly desirous of seeing the grounds of the new Capitol , refused to leave until ProtagonistA had seen them into which the hall had been enlarged for the new institution ; and if ProtagonistA had been right , ProtagonistA should be justified in saying that ProtagonistA had never seen anything so amiss 
ProtagonistA stopped dead in ProtagonistA's tracks 
 ProtagonistA tried to find the source of the sound , but it just was n't there 
 ProtagonistA looked around , but there was nothing 
 ProtagonistA started to walk again , but the sound stopped ProtagonistA once more 
 ProtagonistA could n't figure out what it was 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , ProtagonistA just wanted to keep moving 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and it was starting to get cold 
 ProtagonistA saw a light in the distance and started to walk towards it 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized it was a lamp post 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to see it , ProtagonistA hugged it 
 Then ProtagonistA sat down at the base of the lamp post and rested 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was n't going to stop walking , but at least ProtagonistA could rest for a little while 
ProtagonistA managed to keep ProtagonistA's head and face up , to enjoy the moment 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately , and ProtagonistA was just happy to be alive 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and smiled 
ProtagonistA was a truck driver who spent a lot of time on the road 
 ProtagonistA often thought about the other men who were also on the road and what they might be doing with their time 
 ProtagonistA wondered if they had the same thoughts as ProtagonistA did and if they also thought about the other men on the road 
 ProtagonistA also wondered if they had the same concerns and worries as ProtagonistA did 
The great dream — the thing ProtagonistA should never have taken the risk of doing — the wish , that great wish , that frightful wish , that terrible wish , that terrible wish — that was something ProtagonistA never would have done , if ProtagonistA had not met ProtagonistB , and — And then ProtagonistA drank to the full 
 One day , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the great dream ProtagonistA had , the one ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA could never make come true 
 Encouraged by ProtagonistB's faith in ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA took the risk 
ProtagonistA was out on the ice , fishing with ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA was the only one who had caught anything , and ProtagonistA was feeling pretty proud of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had a wife and two kids , and ProtagonistA worked at a boring office job 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to do something different with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's job , sold ProtagonistA's house , and bought a one - way ticket to Europe 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to travel , and now ProtagonistA was finally doing it 
 ProtagonistA started in France , and then made ProtagonistA's way to Italy , Spain , and Portugal 
 ProtagonistA visited all the famous tourist spots , and then ProtagonistA started to venture off the beaten path 
 ProtagonistA met interesting people and had amazing experiences 
 After a year of travel , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA did n't want to go home 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's new life and ProtagonistA was never going to go back to ProtagonistA's old one 
 ProtagonistA had the worst fear of anything in the world , and the most abiding love of anything in the world to abandon 
 ProtagonistA fancied ProtagonistA had seen everything when ProtagonistA was a little old man 
 When ProtagonistA was younger , ProtagonistA had seen the world and all its wonders 
 ProtagonistA had seen the beauty of the sunsets and the majesty of the mountains 
 ProtagonistA had seen the kindness of strangers and the love of friends 
 But as ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to see the ugliness of the world 
 ProtagonistA saw the cruelty of people and the violence of nature 
 ProtagonistA saw the poverty and the disease 
 ProtagonistA saw the hatred and the bigotry 
 And ProtagonistA saw the death and destruction 
 ProtagonistA was afraid that ProtagonistA would die without ever having experienced true love or happiness 
 So ProtagonistA decided to abandon everything and go off into the world to find ProtagonistA's true purpose 
 ProtagonistA traveled to many different places and ProtagonistA saw many different things 
 But no matter where ProtagonistA went , ProtagonistA could n't find what ProtagonistA was looking for 
 ProtagonistA began to lose hope and ProtagonistA became very depressed 
 But one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's story and ProtagonistB listened 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been looking for something in the wrong places 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's advice and ProtagonistA went on ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA continued ProtagonistA's journey and ProtagonistA eventually found what ProtagonistA was looking for 
 ProtagonistA found happiness and love 
 And ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had always been interested in the world around ProtagonistA , and this was a chance to learn more about it 
 ProtagonistA wanted to know more about the people involved , and the reasons behind the fighting 
 ProtagonistA was also interested in the stories of people who had been affected by the fighting , and ProtagonistA wanted to help them 
 ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer , and when ProtagonistA was younger ProtagonistA would often spend hours in the garden , imagining what it would be like to build ProtagonistA's own house there 
 ProtagonistA spent months working on the house , and when it was finished ProtagonistA was very proud of it 
 ProtagonistA was unaware of ProtagonistB's presence , and ProtagonistA went about ProtagonistA's life as usual 
 ProtagonistA worked hard , and ProtagonistA played hard 
 ProtagonistA made friends and enemies 
 ProtagonistA laughed and ProtagonistA cried 
 ProtagonistA achieved great things , and ProtagonistA made mistakes 
 But through it all , ProtagonistA remained the same dreamer ProtagonistA had always been 
 ProtagonistA was an old man then , but ProtagonistA still had a twinkle in ProtagonistA's eye 
ProtagonistA had been shopping online for a new television for weeks 
 ProtagonistA had done ProtagonistA's research and knew exactly what ProtagonistA wanted 
 ProtagonistA was beginning to lose hope of ever finding a good deal when ProtagonistA stumbled across a Wal - Mart ad 
 The price was unbeatable , so ProtagonistA clicked on the link 
 ProtagonistA explained what ProtagonistA was looking for and the representative promised to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was about to close the chat window when the representative said they could give ProtagonistA a 10 % discount on ProtagonistA's next purchase 
 ProtagonistA was surprised , but happy to have found a good deal 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure how ProtagonistA was supposed to find this city , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to try 
 ProtagonistA spent the next few years wandering the earth , searching for any clues that might lead ProtagonistA to the city 
 Finally , ProtagonistA came across a strange man who told ProtagonistA that the city could be found by following a certain star 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA believed the man , but ProtagonistA decided to follow the star anyway 
 After months of travel , ProtagonistA finally came to a city that matched the description the man had given ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA would be safe here from the chaos of the outside world , and ProtagonistA could finally start working on putting an end to the anarchy 
 ProtagonistA was always getting into some sort of trouble , and it was always my job to try and talk ProtagonistA out of it 
 It was a never - ending cycle , but I always knew that ProtagonistA was worth the trouble 
ProtagonistA rose early that morning , lifting ProtagonistA's ten - pound hammer from the table before he and pounding the ground 
 ProtagonistA had a lot of work to do today and wanted to get an early start 
 ProtagonistA had been working on this house for weeks , and it was finally starting to take shape 
 ProtagonistA worked all morning , hammering nails and sawing wood 
 ProtagonistA worked until late in the afternoon , when ProtagonistA finally finished the last of the work 
 ProtagonistA was tired , but ProtagonistA felt a sense of satisfaction as ProtagonistA looked at the house ProtagonistA had built 
ProtagonistA was happy when I first met ProtagonistA 
 The first thing I ever thought of ProtagonistA was that ProtagonistA was a holy man , and a good man 
 ProtagonistA always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face , and ProtagonistA always seemed to be surrounded by a warm light 
 ProtagonistA would lay ProtagonistA's hands on them and they would be healed of whatever ailment they had 
 ProtagonistA was truly a holy man , and I was blessed to have known ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was once a highly respected merchant 
 ProtagonistA was an expert in the fine arts of navigation , shipbuilding , and explosives 
 ProtagonistA was also an expert in the operation of machinery 
 ProtagonistA was a highly respected merchant because ProtagonistA always delivered on ProtagonistA's promises 
ProtagonistA was the god of the seas , and a man like ProtagonistB had a hard time determining ProtagonistB's true identity 
ProtagonistA was a simple man who lived a simple life 
 ProtagonistA worked hard to support ProtagonistA's family and never asked for anything in return 
 So when ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistB wanted a new dress , ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to go out and buy it for ProtagonistB 
 Little did ProtagonistA know that the dress would cost ProtagonistA more than just money 
 ProtagonistA begrudgingly handed over the money and went home , feeling like ProtagonistA 'd been taken advantage of 
 But ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like ProtagonistA 'd been duped 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA 'd never be able to look at that dress the same way again 
ProtagonistA was a simple man , and ProtagonistA found great comfort in the simple things in life 
 One of ProtagonistA's favorite things to do was to read The Origin of Species , and ProtagonistA was particularly fond of the appendix 
 On this particular afternoon , ProtagonistA was working ProtagonistA's way through the appendix , and ProtagonistA was so engrossed in it that ProtagonistA did n't even notice the cold January weather 
 When ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was startled , and ProtagonistA quickly got to ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what to make of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was something important 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , so ProtagonistA just stood there and waited 
 ProtagonistA was surprised , but ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to help 
 ProtagonistA agreed to go with ProtagonistB , and the two of them set off on their adventure 
 ProtagonistA had never been on a horse before , and ProtagonistA was amazed at how fast they could go 
 ProtagonistA could see the smoke rising from the chimneys , and ProtagonistA could hear the sound of gunfire in the distance 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how they were going to do that , but ProtagonistA trust ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to help 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB worked together to stop the fighting , and eventually they were successful 
 ProtagonistA was a hero , and ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistA's adventure with ProtagonistB 
The first time I saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was dancing through the streets of New York in a red hot mess of a car and a packed black crowd of people , mostly women and children 
ProtagonistA was a dull boy , but not to the point of being a loner , except in the locality where ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , an aunt , and a cousin ; and as ProtagonistA was such a person , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA quite agreeable to everybody , even to the great majority of ProtagonistA's elders 
 However , there was one thing that ProtagonistA was very particular about , and that was ProtagonistA's hair 
 ProtagonistA was always very careful to keep it neat and tidy , and ProtagonistA never allowed anybody to touch it 
  ProtagonistA do n't know ,  ProtagonistA replied 
  ProtagonistA just felt like it 
One morning , after the close of our first term , when the pain on my hand was beginning to subside , ProtagonistA issued a paper which ProtagonistA supposed to be a communication from his Majesty , for it bore the stamp of his Majesty 's office , and was filled with the seal of the State 
ProtagonistA had just lost ProtagonistA's job 
 ProtagonistA had been working at the same company for 10 years and was devastated when ProtagonistA was let go 
 ProtagonistA did not know whether ProtagonistA should rejoice or cry 
 ProtagonistA was not sure what ProtagonistA's next move should be 
 ProtagonistA decided to take some time to think about ProtagonistA's options 
 ProtagonistA did not want to make a rash decision and regretted anything 
 After a few days of reflection , ProtagonistA decided to start ProtagonistA's own business 
 ProtagonistA was excited and scared but knew it was the right decision for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's business was a success and ProtagonistA was soon able to hire other people to work for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA had made the decision to start ProtagonistA's own business and was proud of ProtagonistA's accomplishments 
When ProtagonistA was just a boy , ProtagonistA had a dream 
 In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA was flying high above the clouds 
 ProtagonistA could see the entire world below ProtagonistA , and it was so beautiful 
 ProtagonistA felt so free and happy , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could never be happier than ProtagonistA was in that moment 
ProtagonistA is at the aquarium , looking at the fish 
 ProtagonistA 's always loved fish , and ProtagonistA 's glad ProtagonistA can share their world , even if it 's just for a moment 
 But today , ProtagonistA was late 
ProtagonistA was a new student at the school 
 ProtagonistA was from a different country and did n't know anyone 
 ProtagonistA felt alone and lost 
 One day , ProtagonistA was sitting in the cafeteria by ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA overheard some students talking about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt better knowing that someone was talking about ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA knew the way to heaven 
 ProtagonistA had been a good person all ProtagonistA's life , always helping others and being kind 
 But when ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a dark place 
 ProtagonistA realized then that ProtagonistA knew nothing at all about heaven 
 ProtagonistA had only been in the small town for a few weeks , but it seemed like everyone knew who ProtagonistA was and where ProtagonistA was from 
 ProtagonistA tried to keep to ProtagonistA , but it was difficult when everyone was always talking about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt like a zoo animal on display 
 ProtagonistA was polite , but ProtagonistA just wanted to finish ProtagonistA's shopping and go home 
 As ProtagonistA was leaving , ProtagonistA overheard ProtagonistB whispering to the customer next to ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA 's from that country that 's always in the news 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's face flush with anger , but ProtagonistA just gritted ProtagonistA's teeth and walked out of the store 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being judged and talked about 
 ProtagonistA was just a person , just like everyone else 
 The next day , ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's belongings and left the town 
 ProtagonistA was done with being the center of attention and ProtagonistA did n't want to be anywhere that ProtagonistA was n't welcome 
There was ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was a very old man , and ProtagonistA looked it 
 ProtagonistA was always telling stories about ProtagonistA's life , and how ProtagonistA 'd seen so much change in ProtagonistA's time 
 One day , ProtagonistA was telling a group of young people about how things used to be 
ProtagonistA was taking a walk one day when ProtagonistA suddenly realized that ProtagonistA had been born 
 ProtagonistA was amazed at how much had happened since then 
 ProtagonistA had lived through so many things and had experienced so much 
 ProtagonistA had gone to school and had worked hard to get good grades 
 ProtagonistA had played sports and had been in the band 
 ProtagonistA had dated girls and had been in love 
 ProtagonistA had gone to college and had gotten a good job 
 ProtagonistA had gotten married and had started a family of ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA had been through so much and had accomplished so much 
 ProtagonistA was grateful for all that ProtagonistA had been given and for all that ProtagonistA had been able to do 
 ProtagonistA was a creature of the night , and ProtagonistA preyed on the innocent 
 ProtagonistA would find them alone , in the dark , and ProtagonistA would kill them 
 ProtagonistA was the stuff of nightmares , and ProtagonistA loved it 
The first time I met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was lying on a hospital table in the middle of London 
 ProtagonistA was pale and sweaty , and ProtagonistA's eyes were closed 
 ProtagonistA survived , but ProtagonistA was never the same 
ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , and when ProtagonistA was five years old ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB a name 
 ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB ProtagonistB because ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's favorite name 
ProtagonistA had been sitting in ProtagonistA's study for hours , looking at the old book that was lying on the table in front of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been flipping through its pages slowly , taking in the words and the pictures 
 ProtagonistA had been studying it intently , trying to make sense of it all 
 But now , as the night began to fall , ProtagonistA was starting to feel tired 
 ProtagonistA decided to put the book away and get some sleep 
 But as ProtagonistA reached for it , ProtagonistA heard a noise outside 
 ProtagonistA got up to see what was going on and found ProtagonistA in the Court of the Tuileries 
 ProtagonistA recognized the body as ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA had gotten there , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was dead 
 ProtagonistA could see the light starting to fade from ProtagonistA's own eyes 
 But as ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA felt a sudden surge of love and compassion for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA 
 And in that moment , ProtagonistA was content 
ProtagonistA was a fine , upstanding citizen 
 ProtagonistA kept up with the latest news and trends , and was always looking for ways to improve ProtagonistA's trade and business 
 When the reign of Suddistharma came to an end , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's opportunity 
 ProtagonistA quickly rose to prominence in the new kingdom , and became one of the most prosperous businessmen in the land 
 ProtagonistA was a generous man , and always looked out for the best interests of ProtagonistA's employees and customers 
ProtagonistA stood up from the log ProtagonistA 'd been sitting on and peered out from the dark cover of ProtagonistA's tea cup 
 ProtagonistA 'd been sitting in the same spot for hours , waiting for ProtagonistA's prey to show itself 
 ProtagonistA was patient , though 
 ProtagonistA knew that eventually , ProtagonistA's prey would come 
 And sure enough , after a few more minutes , ProtagonistA saw a movement in the bushes 
 ProtagonistA tensed , readying ProtagonistA for the kill 
 ProtagonistA let out a sigh and relaxed 
 ProtagonistA was n't in the mood to kill tonight 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to go home to ProtagonistA's family 
 So , ProtagonistA turned and walked away , leaving the rabbit to live another day 
One day , soon after ProtagonistA had become a full - grown man , Mr
  ProtagonistA never heard of ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a very distrustful person 
 ProtagonistA never trusted anyone , not even in the most extreme times of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA always thought that people were out to get ProtagonistA and that they would take advantage of ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA let them 
 ProtagonistA was always afraid that they would hurt ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking through the forest and ProtagonistA came across a small cottage 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant to trust ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was very tired and thirsty 
 ProtagonistA decided to take a chance and ProtagonistA went inside 
 ProtagonistA was so grateful that ProtagonistA decided to trust ProtagonistB 
 From then on , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB became good friends 
 ProtagonistA would visit ProtagonistB often and ProtagonistB would help ProtagonistA through ProtagonistA's tough times 
 ProtagonistA was very grateful to ProtagonistB for everything ProtagonistB had done for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was always so excited to see new places and meet new people 
 ProtagonistA loved the history and the culture 
 ProtagonistA would always bring back souvenirs for us 
ProtagonistA had been dreaming of snow since ProtagonistA had been a boy 
 ProtagonistA would lay in bed at night and imagine what it would be like to wake up to a world blanketed in white 
 ProtagonistA would close ProtagonistA's eyes and feel the cold air on ProtagonistA's face and the flakes falling on ProtagonistA's tongue 
 ProtagonistA woke up to find ProtagonistA's entire neighborhood covered in a thick layer of snow 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA's eyes ! ProtagonistA quickly got dressed and went outside to play 
 ProtagonistA made snow angels , had a snowball fight with ProtagonistA's friends , and built an epic snowman 
 ProtagonistA went to bed that night with a smile on ProtagonistA's face , dreaming of the next time it would snow 
ProtagonistA had been driving for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting tired 
 ProtagonistA had been on the road for days , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA was going insane 
 ProtagonistA could see the wheel in front of ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA could n't keep ProtagonistA's hands on it 
 ProtagonistA was getting so tired that ProtagonistA started to see things that were n't there 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB in the road , and ProtagonistA swerved to avoid ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA lost control of the car and it went off the road 
 ProtagonistA hit a tree and was killed instantly 
 ProtagonistA knew that one day ProtagonistA would be a famous musician , and ProtagonistA was right 
 ProtagonistA became a rock star , and ProtagonistA was loved by fans all over the world 
 ProtagonistA lived a happy and successful life , and ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistA's ability to see the future 
There was once a boy who was known to everyone but Bob by ProtagonistA's given name – a boy called Noah , who was supposed to have been born in the year 1224 , on the very day that ProtagonistA was , according to some versions , murdered by a demon 
 ProtagonistA was a happy child , always smiling and laughing , and everyone who met ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to take care of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB passed away a few months later 
 ProtagonistA was now all alone in the world 
 ProtagonistA had no family and no home 
 ProtagonistA wandered the streets , begging for food and sleeping in doorways 
 One winter , ProtagonistA became very ill 
 ProtagonistA lay down in a doorway and curled up in a ball , trying to keep warm 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die 
 As ProtagonistA lay there , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was too weak to move , and so ProtagonistA just lay there , staring at ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA was too weak to resist , and so ProtagonistA just nodded 
 When ProtagonistC stood up , ProtagonistA felt different 
 ProtagonistA felt stronger and healthier 
 ProtagonistA sat up and looked at ProtagonistC 
  Thank ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 're welcome , ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been sailing the East India ocean for years , and ProtagonistA had never seen a more beautiful sight than ProtagonistB 
 Cecil was ProtagonistB's name , and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistA ran into ProtagonistB again on a stormy night , when the waves were crashing and the wind was howling 
 ProtagonistA searched for ProtagonistB for weeks , but ProtagonistA was never able to find ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA always wondered what happened to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA vowed to never forget ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistC was also very kind and ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistC loved ProtagonistB very much 
 ProtagonistA had a wife and two kids , and ProtagonistA worked at a bank 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking to work , when ProtagonistA saw a $ 20 bill on the ground 
 ProtagonistA picked it up , and ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA ran all the way to work to tell ProtagonistB about it 
 ProtagonistA did n't know whether to believe ProtagonistB or not , but ProtagonistA decided to go along with it 
 After all , what did ProtagonistA have to lose?So ProtagonistA went along with ProtagonistB's plan , and soon ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA ruling the universe 
 ProtagonistA made the best of it , just as ProtagonistB had said ProtagonistA would 
 And ProtagonistA ruled it well , for many years 
 But then one day , ProtagonistA began to doubt ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA began to wonder if ProtagonistA really was a god , or if ProtagonistA was just a man who had been lucky enough to find himself in a position of power 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistA really was a god 
 ProtagonistA 've always been a god 
 ProtagonistA just did n't know it until now 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was a god , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would always be one 
The first time I met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was in the kitchen of ProtagonistA's Nantucket house , stirring a pot of oysters and staring in the mirror 
ProtagonistA was dead , and ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a man , or at least ProtagonistA looked like one , of unquestionable fortune 
 ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB and three kids that ProtagonistA loved dearly , and a job that paid ProtagonistA well 
 But ProtagonistA was a man with a secret 
 ProtagonistA was also a woman 
 For as long as ProtagonistA could remember , ProtagonistA had felt like ProtagonistA was in the wrong body 
 ProtagonistA had never told anyone about ProtagonistA's secret , but ProtagonistA had always known that ProtagonistA was a woman trapped in a man 's body 
 ProtagonistA had never been comfortable in ProtagonistA's own skin , and ProtagonistA had always felt like ProtagonistA was playing a role 
 ProtagonistA was a good husband and father , but ProtagonistA always felt like something was missing 
 It was a difficult process , but ProtagonistA was finally able to live ProtagonistA's life authentically 
 ProtagonistA was happier than ProtagonistA had ever been , and ProtagonistA's family was by ProtagonistA's side every step of the way 
ProtagonistA was in a dream in which ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but then ProtagonistA agreed 
 When ProtagonistA awoke , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA was transformed into a god 
There was ProtagonistA in a village where ProtagonistA had no name , and from whence ProtagonistA looked no more than a village - name ; and ProtagonistA was well known to everybody , and was a good , honest boy in everything 
 But one day , ProtagonistA went to the village where ProtagonistA had no name , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB there who was also well known to everybody 
 And ProtagonistB said to ProtagonistA ,  Why are ProtagonistA here ? ProtagonistA have no name 
  And ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA am looking for a name 
 ProtagonistA had always loved books , but this was something else entirely 
 ProtagonistA felt as if ProtagonistA had been given a great gift and ProtagonistA was not sure what to do with it 
 ProtagonistA started to read the works of M
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget this and ProtagonistA was grateful to the author for giving ProtagonistA this gift 
ProtagonistA is sixteen , and ProtagonistA really is a genius , or at least a great talent 
 ProtagonistA can play the piano like no one else can , and ProtagonistA composes ProtagonistA's own music 
 ProtagonistA is a shy person , but when ProtagonistA sits down at the piano , ProtagonistA comes alive 
 ProtagonistA plays with such passion and emotion that everyone who hears ProtagonistA is moved 
 ProtagonistA loves to play for people , and ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA's music can make a difference in their lives 
 ProtagonistA is thrilled , and ProtagonistA knows that this is ProtagonistA's big chance 
 ProtagonistA signs the contract , and ProtagonistA 's on ProtagonistA's way to becoming a famous musician 
ProtagonistA always loved the sea 
 As a child , ProtagonistA would tell ProtagonistA's parents that ProtagonistA would hunt the sea and go look for fish 
 ProtagonistA was going to hunt the sea and find the biggest fish ever 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was out on ProtagonistA's boat , ProtagonistA saw a huge fish 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA started to chase it 
 But ProtagonistA was determined to catch it 
 ProtagonistA went out every day , trying to find that fish again 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA did find it 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA caught it with ProtagonistA's bare hands 
 ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA took it home to show ProtagonistA's parents 
ProtagonistA came to the yacht concert with ProtagonistA's crew 
 ProtagonistA was a big fan of the band and was excited to see them perform 
 ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA got to see ProtagonistA's favorite band perform 
ProtagonistA had always loved coming to ProtagonistA's cabin on the lake 
 ProtagonistA felt at ease and just took in the beauty around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt grateful for all that ProtagonistA had in life 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a loud noise coming from the other side of the lake 
 ProtagonistA quickly ran towards the noise and saw ProtagonistB struggling to stay afloat 
 ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to jump in and save ProtagonistB 
 After getting ProtagonistB to safety , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel shaken 
 It was a close call and ProtagonistA was just happy that ProtagonistA was able to help 
 ProtagonistA realized that this was a reminder to always be grateful for what ProtagonistA had in life and to always be ready to help others in need 
In the year of our Lord 1849 , in the month of May , ProtagonistA came to the door of the house at 14 James Street , and said ProtagonistA was going to Washington to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA had always been interested in politics and ProtagonistA thought it would be a once in a lifetime opportunity to see ProtagonistB in person 
 ProtagonistA set out on ProtagonistA's journey and arrived in Washington a few days later 
 ProtagonistA went to the White House and requested a meeting with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA had traveled all the way from Massachusetts to see ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA was n't going to leave until ProtagonistA got a chance to speak with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB spoke for a few minutes about politics and the current state of the country 
 ProtagonistA returned home to Massachusetts and told ProtagonistC all about ProtagonistA's journey and ProtagonistA's meeting with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was an orphan who lived in a very poor village 
 ProtagonistA always kept to ProtagonistA and never talked to anyone in the village 
 ProtagonistA agreed and ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA a bag of gold 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA went to the nearest town and bought ProtagonistA a new set of clothes and a horse 
 ProtagonistA rode back to ProtagonistA's village and showed off ProtagonistA's new riches 
 ProtagonistA just smiled and said that ProtagonistA was a very lucky man 
ProtagonistA had been on ProtagonistA's usual wife - beating sprawl for hours , after how deeply ProtagonistA had been in debt and wasted luxury 
 ProtagonistA had been hitting ProtagonistB for days , and ProtagonistB was getting tired of it 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do without ProtagonistB 
In the year 1882 , ProtagonistA married ProtagonistB -- at Ull - west in the province of Wales 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had a very happy life together 
 It was a dangerous place , but ProtagonistA was confident in their abilities 
 ProtagonistA flew in and began to feast on the cooked flesh 
 ProtagonistA was always the odd one out , the one that no one wanted to be around 
 ProtagonistA was always the last to be picked for teams , the one that no one wanted to sit with at lunch 
 ProtagonistA was always alone , and ProtagonistA always would be 
ProtagonistA was always a bit of a troublemaker 
 But one day , ProtagonistA went too far 
 ProtagonistA got into a fight with someone and ended up hurting them really badly 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had messed up and that ProtagonistA was in big trouble 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to face the consequences of ProtagonistA's actions , so ProtagonistA ran away 
 ProtagonistA was on the run for a long time 
 ProtagonistA changed ProtagonistA's name and ProtagonistA's appearance , but ProtagonistA was always looking over ProtagonistA's shoulder , afraid that someone would recognize ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was planning on asking ProtagonistB to marry ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
ProtagonistA may have put it best at the end of ProtagonistA's last letter 
 ProtagonistA hope you can find happiness without ProtagonistA 
  With those words , ProtagonistA ended our relationship of two years 
 It was a clean break , and though I was heartbroken , I knew ProtagonistA was right 
ProtagonistA had always been a go - getter 
 ProtagonistA was never content to just sit around and do nothing 
 ProtagonistA was always looking for new challenges and new ways to better ProtagonistA 
 So , ProtagonistA signed up for the program 
 ProtagonistA learned a lot of new things and ProtagonistA was able to do things that ProtagonistA had never done before 
 ProtagonistA was really enjoying ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to preach 
 ProtagonistA was scared 
 ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA could do it 
 But ProtagonistA decided to try 
 ProtagonistA got up in front of the group of people and ProtagonistA started to preach 
 At first , ProtagonistA was really nervous 
 But as ProtagonistA continued to speak , ProtagonistA started to feel more confident 
 And by the end of ProtagonistA's sermon , ProtagonistA was really proud of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was happy 
 ProtagonistA had proved to ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could do anything ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to 
ProtagonistA was a simple man who lived a simple life 
 ProtagonistA worked hard to support ProtagonistA's family and always tried to do what was right 
 However , ProtagonistA possessed a power that ProtagonistA did n't fully understand 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to lose ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB's time was coming to an end 
 That night , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's bedside and held ProtagonistB's hand as ProtagonistB passed away 
 As ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistB's life force leave ProtagonistB's body , ProtagonistA used ProtagonistA's power to keep the angel of death at bay 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure how long ProtagonistA could keep the angel at bay , but ProtagonistA was determined to keep ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA for as long as possible 
 For weeks , ProtagonistA kept the angel of death at bay 
 ProtagonistA did n't leave ProtagonistB's side , even for a moment 
 ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA did , the angel would take ProtagonistB from ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was grateful to have been able to spend ProtagonistA's last days at home , surrounded by ProtagonistA's family 
 On the morning that ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA was peering into the dusty corner of ProtagonistA's room and , spotting a tiny figure looming between a pair of awnings , knew immediately that it was ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA smiled , knowing that ProtagonistA was finally going to be reunited with ProtagonistA's wife , who had died a few years ago 
 ProtagonistA suddenly collapsed , and when the blood - mourner went to check on ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was already dead 
 ProtagonistA had been a good man , and the blood - mourner was sad to see ProtagonistA go 
 ProtagonistA was a strong young man , and ProtagonistA quickly recovered from ProtagonistA's ordeal

 ProtagonistA had never felt unsafe in Paris before , but now ProtagonistA was beginning to feel like ProtagonistA was in danger 
 ProtagonistA decided to leave the city and go back to the United States 
ProtagonistA was a investigative journalist 
 ProtagonistA had been following a lead on a story for weeks and ProtagonistA was finally about to get the scoop 
 ProtagonistA walked into the building where the story was taking place and saw the door open 
 ProtagonistA walked in and saw a man sitting at a table with a recorder 
 ProtagonistA walked up to the man and said ,  All right , said ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA walked through the open door , ProtagonistA 'll record it all for you

 ProtagonistA could see the ship disappearing into the distance 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to die 
 But then ProtagonistA felt something grab hold of ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was pulled to safety 
 ProtagonistA looked up and saw a whale swimming next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had never been so grateful in ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA had always dreamed of visiting the great pyramid of Isanaz 
 ProtagonistA had read about it in books and seen pictures of it in magazines , but nothing could prepare ProtagonistA for the sheer size and majesty of the structure

 The middle age is the hardest age for any man , and not for the better , said ProtagonistA , for it is some years after the death of ProtagonistA's parents , that ProtagonistA come to the conclusion that the whole of humanity has become the same age , or , at best , a very long time into it 
 ProtagonistA lived alone in a small house , and spent ProtagonistA's days gardening and reading 
 ProtagonistA was a contented man , but the feeling that ProtagonistA was the only one getting older had begun to weigh on ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA went for a walk in the park , and saw a young couple sitting on a bench 
 As ProtagonistA watched them , ProtagonistA felt a pang of envy 
 ProtagonistA turned away , and walked home 
 As ProtagonistA went , ProtagonistA passed a group of young people , and ProtagonistA heard them laughing 
 When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's bedroom , and lay down on ProtagonistA's bed 
 ProtagonistA stared up at the ceiling , and felt tears welling up in ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA got up , and went downstairs to the kitchen 
 ProtagonistA took a knife from the drawer , and walked back upstairs 
 ProtagonistA stood over ProtagonistA's bed , and looked down at ProtagonistA's body 
 ProtagonistA was an old man , and ProtagonistA had lived a good life 
 ProtagonistA raised the knife , and plunged it into ProtagonistA's chest 
 As ProtagonistA felt the life ebbing away from ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA had a vision of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes , and died 
When ProtagonistA was growing old , ProtagonistA 'd rather be the King of the Holy Land than the King of the City of the same name 
 ProtagonistA was getting tired of all the fighting and the noise and the pollution in the city 
 And ProtagonistA was getting tired of all the people who were constantly trying to take advantage of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA wanted to go somewhere where ProtagonistA could be at peace and where ProtagonistA could be surrounded by people who loved ProtagonistA 
 So , ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things and left the city 
 ProtagonistA was happy in ProtagonistA's new home and ProtagonistA soon forgot all about the city 
 ProtagonistA was content to live out the rest of ProtagonistA's days in peace and happiness , surrounded by those who loved ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had found a cache of documents , hidden away in a secret room in ProtagonistB's palace 
ProtagonistA had always been a bright child , and when ProtagonistA was seven , ProtagonistA learned how to read 
 ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistA and loved to show off ProtagonistA's new skill to ProtagonistA's family and friends 
 ProtagonistA would sit for hours with a book , sounding out the words and trying to make sense of the stories 
 ProtagonistA had no choice but to return to the house and try again 
 This time , ProtagonistA was successful in lighting the fire and was able to enjoy the warmth of the flames 
 ProtagonistA was a very average man , and ProtagonistA lived a very average life 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA wanted to do something different with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had always dreamed of living in Australia , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to make that dream a reality 
 ProtagonistA had no idea what ProtagonistA was going to do when ProtagonistA got there , but ProtagonistA was excited for the adventure 
 ProtagonistA decided to buy a book to pass the time , but ProtagonistA had a hard time finding anything that interested ProtagonistA 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA found a book that looked interesting , and ProtagonistA started to read it 
 By the time ProtagonistA's plane finally arrived in Australia , ProtagonistA had decided that ProtagonistA was going to travel the world and have ProtagonistA's own adventures 
  ProtagonistA 'm just happy ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'm going to tell ProtagonistB what ProtagonistA really think of ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
   ProtagonistA do n't care ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'm not going to take it anymore 
ProtagonistA was walking home from school one day when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing on the side of the road 
 ProtagonistA thought for a moment and then said that ProtagonistA wanted to be the richest man in the world 
 ProtagonistA went home and told ProtagonistA's parents about ProtagonistA's wish , and they laughed and said that ProtagonistA was just being silly 
 ProtagonistA did n't believe them , and sure enough , the next day ProtagonistA woke up to find that ProtagonistA was the richest man in the world 
 ProtagonistA had more money than ProtagonistA could ever spend , and ProtagonistA lived a life of luxury from then on 
ProtagonistA was having a feast in ProtagonistA's room and the girl went into the room 
 ProtagonistA said ,  Son of a whore , as the girl went into the very room where ProtagonistA had the feast 
ProtagonistA had been working on the roof of the Lancaster Moor house for hours , and ProtagonistA was exhausted 
 ProtagonistA was about to take a break when ProtagonistA slipped and fell 
 ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistA's head on the ground and was knocked unconscious 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was in a hospital bed 
 ProtagonistA was now penniless and alone 
 ProtagonistA was grateful to be alive , but ProtagonistA had lost everything that mattered to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was a young boy who lived in a small town 
 ProtagonistA was always the last one to be picked for teams in school , and ProtagonistA was always the one who got made fun of 
 But ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA was happy just being ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking to ProtagonistA's office when ProtagonistA saw a group of kids picking on a smaller child 
 ProtagonistA did n't like seeing anyone get bullied , so ProtagonistA decided to stand up for the kid 
 ProtagonistA walked over to the group and told them to stop 
 ProtagonistA kept telling them to stop , and eventually they did 
 ProtagonistA was always there to help anyone who was being bullied , and ProtagonistA was always there to lend a helping hand 
 ProtagonistA was a true hero , and ProtagonistA made a difference in ProtagonistA's community 
 ProtagonistA denied the rumor , but no one believed ProtagonistA 
 At ProtagonistA's trial , ProtagonistA maintained ProtagonistA's innocence , but the evidence was overwhelming 
 Now , ProtagonistA spends ProtagonistA's days in a small cell , with only ProtagonistA's thoughts for company 
 ProtagonistA thinks about the what - ifs and the could - have - beens 
 But most of all , ProtagonistA thinks about the family ProtagonistA destroyed and the life ProtagonistA will never have again 
A hundred years ago , in the year 1873 , ProtagonistA happened within the city of Detroit 
 ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was sad to hear this news , but ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistB well 
 ProtagonistA was skeptical at first , but ProtagonistB was adamant that ProtagonistC would bring peace and prosperity to the land 
 ProtagonistA did as ProtagonistA was told , and the people began to get excited about the prospect of ProtagonistC 
ProtagonistA had only ten fingers on each hand , but ProtagonistA was a very good pianist 
 ProtagonistA had been playing the piano since ProtagonistA was a little boy and had developed a great deal of skill 
 Even though ProtagonistA had fewer fingers than most people , ProtagonistA was still able to play the piano very well 
 One day , ProtagonistA was playing the piano in a park when a group of kids came up to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA just kept playing , ignoring the kids 
 ProtagonistA continued to play , enjoying the music ProtagonistA was making 
 ProtagonistA did n't let the mean words of the kids bother ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was a good pianist , no matter how many fingers ProtagonistA had 
ProtagonistA died on a rainy day in 19 , 18 , so ProtagonistA was about 21 when I was born 
 ProtagonistA loved the outdoors and went on hikes and camping trips often 
 One day , however , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA's account was empty , and that all ProtagonistA's money had been stolen ! 
The last time I saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA had just been in a terrible car accident 
 ProtagonistA was in a wheelchair , and ProtagonistA's face was so badly injured that ProtagonistA was unrecognizable 
 ProtagonistA died the next day 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a conspiracy theorist 
 ProtagonistA knew that the world was heading towards destruction , and ProtagonistA did everything ProtagonistA could to prepare for it 
 When the world finally ended , ProtagonistA was one of the few people left alive 
 ProtagonistA watched as the bombs fell , the fires burned , and the people screamed 
 ProtagonistA knew it was already too late to save the rest of the world ; but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forgive ProtagonistA for letting it happen 
In the year 1246 , ProtagonistA came to England , became a citizen , and settled at East Anglia 
ProtagonistA had been thinking about what ProtagonistA wanted to say for weeks 
 ProtagonistA had practiced in ProtagonistA's head over and over again , but ProtagonistA was still nervous 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to make things awkward between them , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to say something 
 ProtagonistA hope you can understand 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure how the other person would react , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to take the risk 
 ProtagonistA 's a big - shot warlord in the Middle East , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of money , and ProtagonistA 's got some big guns , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of bombs , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of guns 
 ProtagonistA 's a dangerous man , and you should be careful around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA watched as the ship got closer and closer , until the sun was right above ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA could feel the heat of the sun on ProtagonistA's face , and ProtagonistA knew that the world was about to change 
ProtagonistA was a great husband and father 
 ProtagonistA always put ProtagonistA's family first and made sure they were taken care of 
 ProtagonistA was always there for them when they needed ProtagonistA and was always willing to help out 
 ProtagonistA was a great role model for ProtagonistA's children and was always there for them when they needed ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA's feet were starting to hurt 
 ProtagonistA had been careful to avoid the worst of the traffic , but the narrow streets of Copenhagen were still crowded 
 ProtagonistA was getting hungry , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA did n't have much money left 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up and go back to ProtagonistA's room when ProtagonistA saw a sign for a bakery 
 ProtagonistA decided to go in and see if they had anything ProtagonistA could afford 
 ProtagonistA was about to leave when ProtagonistB spoke again 
 ProtagonistA handed ProtagonistB the money and thanked ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was about to leave when ProtagonistA saw a sign for a free lunch 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA's luck ! ProtagonistA went in and got ProtagonistA a bowl of soup and a piece of bread 
 ProtagonistA sat down at a table and ate ProtagonistA's lunch , feeling grateful for the kindness of strangers 
ProtagonistA went into the water and sat there , a pale - faced man , taking in the ship before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had always loved the ocean , ever since ProtagonistA was a child 
 But now , sitting in the water , ProtagonistA felt only sadness 
 ProtagonistA had lost everything in the war - ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA's family , ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA had nothing left but ProtagonistA's memories 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how much longer ProtagonistA could go on 
In the morning ProtagonistA was asleep , and the roil of ProtagonistA's mind was soothed by a light stream of thought or emotion that it was as if ProtagonistA had drifted off into a dream 
 ProtagonistA dreamed that ProtagonistA was walking through a beautiful garden , and the sun was shining down on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt so happy and content in the dream that ProtagonistA did n't want to wake up 
 But eventually ProtagonistA did , and ProtagonistA was back in ProtagonistA's bedroom , with the sun shining in through the window 
ProtagonistA had just turned eighteen , and was finally emancipated from the foster care system 
 ProtagonistA had aged out of the system and had nowhere to go , until ProtagonistA was lucky enough to be taken in by a family who had fostered many children before 
 ProtagonistA was nervous but excited to finally have a real home 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA belonged for the first time in ProtagonistA's life 
There was once a boy with a very big , very round face and very large eyes and a very small head , but who was much more important than the rest of the boys in the school , and who had played a very important part in Bob 's life , and whose name was ProtagonistA ; and ProtagonistA was a very good , well - behaved boy , and of a very good family , and in a very good school , and was a very useful and useful growth 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner 
 ProtagonistA was never really good at making friends and ProtagonistA was always the last to be picked for team sports 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA had a reason to be outside and ProtagonistA was good at something 
 ProtagonistA loved the feeling of the dirt on ProtagonistA's fingers and the satisfaction of seeing a plant grow 
 ProtagonistA started a landscaping company and began to make a name for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was happy and successful 
 One day , ProtagonistA was working in ProtagonistA's own garden when ProtagonistA got a call from a client 
 ProtagonistA rushed over to assess the damage 
 But ProtagonistA did n't give up 
 ProtagonistA rolled up ProtagonistA's sleeves and got to work 
 ProtagonistA worked day and night to restore the garden to its former glory 
 ' ProtagonistA was always there to help when someone 's garden was in trouble 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's job and ProtagonistA loved the earth 
 And ProtagonistA knew that as long as ProtagonistA's fingers were touching the earth , ProtagonistA was making a difference 
ProtagonistA , lamented that ProtagonistB's profession had become so irrelevant , and had become so feeble and uncertain , that ProtagonistA no longer felt ProtagonistA bound to contact it with any amount of importance 
 ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB's work first hand and knew that ProtagonistB was not cut out for the job 
 ProtagonistA had tried to talk to ProtagonistB about it , to see if there was anything that could be done to help ProtagonistB , but it was like talking to a wall 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA just stopped talking to ProtagonistB altogether 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to see ProtagonistB's decline anymore 
 ProtagonistA wanted to remember the Bob ProtagonistA used to know , the Bob who was passionate about ProtagonistB's work and who made a difference 
 But even though ProtagonistA stopped talking to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA still thought about ProtagonistB often 
 ProtagonistA wondered how ProtagonistB was doing and if ProtagonistB was still in the profession 
 ProtagonistA hoped that ProtagonistB had found something else that made ProtagonistB happy , something that was more fulfilling than ProtagonistB's work as a physician 
ProtagonistA had not known the time when ProtagonistA would die , but it was an unpleasant year for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had been worse for it 
 ProtagonistA had been in and out of the hospital for months , and ProtagonistA's family had been by ProtagonistA's side the whole time 
 ProtagonistA passed away peacefully in ProtagonistA's sleep , surrounded by the people who loved ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was in the kitchen making tea for the family when ProtagonistA was startled to discover that ProtagonistB had gone into labour 
 ProtagonistA quickly called for an ambulance and ProtagonistB was rushed to the hospital 
 ProtagonistA was by ProtagonistB's side the whole time , holding ProtagonistB's hand and telling ProtagonistB everything would be alright 
 ProtagonistA was always a happy kid , always smiling and making everyone laugh 
 Even when ProtagonistA was going through tough times , ProtagonistA would always find a way to make everyone around ProtagonistA smile 
 That 's just the kind of person ProtagonistA is 
ProtagonistA was a large man , but ProtagonistA was no match for ProtagonistA's companion 
 ProtagonistA was unconscious before ProtagonistA hit the ground 
 When ProtagonistA was six , ProtagonistA had already grown into a handsome and somewhat charming boy 
 ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA happy and prosperous by the exert 
 ProtagonistA had a lot of friends and was always the life of the party 
 One day , ProtagonistA was playing with ProtagonistA's friends and ran into a tree 
 ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistA's head and was knocked unconscious 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was in a hospital bed 
 After ProtagonistA was released , ProtagonistA was never the same 
 But ProtagonistA was not content 
 ProtagonistA wanted to get back to ProtagonistA's ship and see the world 
ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a professional soccer player 
 Finally , after years of dedication and hard work , ProtagonistA has come to the goal of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA 's excited to see what the future holds for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knows that anything is possible now that ProtagonistA 's made it to the top 
ProtagonistA stood upright , staring thoughtfully at the cold , silver plate before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA remembered the days when ProtagonistA would have to polish it for hours , until ProtagonistA's arm ached , just to get a speck of dirt off 
 ProtagonistA sighed and picked up ProtagonistA's fork 
 ProtagonistA had been standing there for far too long , and ProtagonistA's food was getting cold 
ProtagonistA had been using ProtagonistA's hearing to the full when ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had to be able to hear ProtagonistB's heart beating , to feel the warmth of ProtagonistB's blood on ProtagonistA's hands , to smell the fear in ProtagonistB's sweat 
 In the days before ProtagonistA's death , as the fever raged through ProtagonistA's body , ProtagonistA had visions 
 ProtagonistA saw Jesus Christ himself , and ProtagonistA saw the gates of Heaven open before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's deceased loved ones , and they called out to ProtagonistA , beckoning ProtagonistA to come with them 
 And in ProtagonistA's final moments , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had always been a good storyteller , but now ProtagonistA was able to see the world in a different light 
 ProtagonistA could see the beauty in every story , and ProtagonistA was able to share that beauty with others 
 ProtagonistA was able to make people laugh and cry with ProtagonistA's stories , and ProtagonistA was able to touch their hearts 
 ProtagonistA was a master of ProtagonistA's craft , and ProtagonistA was loved by all who heard ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had just before ProtagonistA turned twenty - three had to endure what had hitherto been tolerable physical pain 
 ProtagonistA tried ProtagonistA's best to tough it out , but eventually the pain became too much and ProtagonistA had to go to the hospital 
 ProtagonistA was healthy , but the pain was real 
 ProtagonistA was grateful for the relief , but ProtagonistA could n't help but wonder what was causing the pain 
 ProtagonistA saw a few more doctors , but they all had the same answer 
 ProtagonistA was healthy , but the pain was real 
 ProtagonistA tried to live ProtagonistA's life as best ProtagonistA could , but the pain was always there , lurking in the background 
 ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to ignore it , but eventually it became too much 
 ProtagonistA could n't take it anymore 
 ProtagonistA overdosed on the pain medication and died 
ProtagonistA had always been a fiery child 
 From a young age , ProtagonistA was always quick to anger 
 By the time ProtagonistA was nine , ProtagonistA was already burning mad 
 ProtagonistA was always getting into fights at school and getting into trouble at home 
 ProtagonistA was skeptical at first , but ProtagonistA decided to give it a try 
 After a few weeks of attending the classes , ProtagonistA started to see a difference in ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was able to control ProtagonistA's anger and started to make better choices 
ProtagonistA had been in a coma for weeks , and the doctors had decided to give ProtagonistA a new heart 
 ProtagonistA did n't want a new heart ; ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistA's old one back 
 ProtagonistA died a few weeks later , but ProtagonistA died with ProtagonistA's own heart 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was n't very happy 
 ProtagonistA was always getting into trouble and did n't have any friends 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to run away from home 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to get away from everything 
 After a few days of walking , ProtagonistA came to a big city 
 ProtagonistA did n't know anyone there , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to find a place to stay 
 ProtagonistA found a cheap hotel and got a room 
 ProtagonistA was happy to be away from home and did n't care about anything else 
ProtagonistA was a man of extremely high moral character and , although ProtagonistA had the greatest number of notables of every description in the world , besides ProtagonistA's wife and children , was altogether a very poor man 
 But , despite all of ProtagonistA's good qualities , ProtagonistA was just not a very good businessman 
 ProtagonistA was always helping others and giving them a hand up , but ProtagonistA never seemed to be able to get ahead ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA thought about it for a long time and , although it went against everything ProtagonistA believed in , ProtagonistA finally agreed 
 ProtagonistA went out and got a job as a janitor at a local office building 
 Although ProtagonistA was no longer ProtagonistA's own boss , ProtagonistA continued to work hard and be the best janitor that ProtagonistA could be 
 ProtagonistA was always going above and beyond , and ProtagonistA's work ethic was second to none 
 ProtagonistA continued to work hard and , although ProtagonistA was never able to achieve the level of success that ProtagonistA had originally envisioned for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was content knowing that ProtagonistA was providing for ProtagonistA's family and doing what was right 
Once , when ProtagonistA was only eleven , ProtagonistA became really bored 
 ProtagonistA had nothing to do and no one to play with 
 So ProtagonistA decided to go exploring 
 ProtagonistA had never been outside of ProtagonistA's neighborhood before , so ProtagonistA was excited to see what ProtagonistA could find 
 ProtagonistA walked for hours , but did n't find anything interesting 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up and go home when ProtagonistA saw a sign that said  Beware of Dog 
  ProtagonistA had never seen a real dog before , so ProtagonistA was curious 
 ProtagonistA followed the sign to a big house 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door and a big , friendly dog came out 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA made a new friend 
ProtagonistA was driving back from the library , listening to the end of a lecture when ProtagonistA was startled to find ProtagonistA in the middle of a city 
 ProtagonistA had no idea how ProtagonistA had gotten there , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel panicky 
 ProtagonistA pulled over to the side of the road and tried to collect ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was in a part of town ProtagonistA did n't recognize 
 ProtagonistA tried to remember the last thing ProtagonistA had done before ProtagonistA ended up there , but ProtagonistA could n't 
 ProtagonistA got out of the car and started walking , hoping to find someone who could help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't get far before ProtagonistA was accosted by a group of rough - looking men 
 ProtagonistA handed over ProtagonistA's wallet and keys , and they pushed ProtagonistA to the ground 
 As they drove away , ProtagonistA lay there , wondering what was going to happen to ProtagonistA 
The night ProtagonistA was arrested , ProtagonistA awoke to find ProtagonistA in a cell with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was asleep , so ProtagonistA could n't tell what ProtagonistB looked like 
 ProtagonistA wondered how ProtagonistA had gotten there 
 ProtagonistA must have been drugged , ProtagonistA thought 
 ProtagonistA tried to stand up , but ProtagonistA's legs were weak and ProtagonistA fell back down onto the hard bench 
 ProtagonistA looked around the cell for a way to escape , but there was none 
 ProtagonistA would have to wait until morning to find out what was going on 
ProtagonistA had never known the heart of a woman , and ProtagonistA did not even pretend to be surprised at ProtagonistB's romance 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit suspicious of ProtagonistB's husband , Mr
 ProtagonistA was happy to be ProtagonistB's confidant and friend , and ProtagonistA listened to ProtagonistB's stories of ProtagonistB's romance with great interest 
 ProtagonistA was a little bit jealous of the man ProtagonistB was seeing , but ProtagonistA was also happy for ProtagonistB 
When ProtagonistA breached the roof of Montparnasse , ProtagonistA had no intention of retreating 
 ProtagonistA was determined to destroy the place 
 ProtagonistA had seen the reports of the atrocities that had been committed there , and ProtagonistA was not going to let those monsters get away with it 
 ProtagonistA was going to make them pay 
 ProtagonistA mowed down anyone who got in ProtagonistA's way , and ProtagonistA did n't stop until ProtagonistA reached the inner sanctum of the prison 
 There , ProtagonistA found the ringleaders of the operation 
 ProtagonistA gunned them down without hesitation 
 ProtagonistA had avenged the innocent lives that had been lost 
 ProtagonistA turned to leave , but not before ProtagonistA set fire to the place , making sure that it would be destroyed 
ProtagonistA was going to China , but first ProtagonistA was going to see ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistB's house , ProtagonistA was surprised to see how much it had changed 
  ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA 'm here 
 ProtagonistA sat down in the chair next to ProtagonistB and watched ProtagonistB's sleep 
ProtagonistA , once remarked that ProtagonistA was inclined either to be a monster , or to be nothing at all 
 ProtagonistA was never quite sure which ProtagonistA would be on any given day 
 Some days ProtagonistA would wake up feeling like a monster , and other days ProtagonistA would feel like nothing at all 
 One day , ProtagonistA woke up feeling like a monster 
 ProtagonistA looked in the mirror and saw that ProtagonistA's eyes were red and ProtagonistA's teeth were sharp 
 ProtagonistA growled at ProtagonistA's reflection and then went out into the world to terrorize everyone ProtagonistA came across 
 ProtagonistA laughed as ProtagonistA saw the fear in their eyes 
 The next day , ProtagonistA woke up feeling like nothing at all 
 ProtagonistA looked in the mirror and saw that ProtagonistA's eyes were normal and ProtagonistA's teeth were dull 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was invisible and no one could see ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA walked through the world unnoticed and unimportant 
 ProtagonistA looked in the mirror and saw a monster staring back at ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA also saw a person who was tired of this cycle 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to be a monster or nothing at all 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be something in between 
 So , ProtagonistA made the decision to change 
 ProtagonistA started to learn how to control ProtagonistA's monster side , and ProtagonistA started to pay more attention to the world around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA became something new , something in between a monster and nothing at all 
 And ProtagonistA was finally happy 
 On the contrary , they were delighted with ProtagonistA's singularities of speech — such an art of speaking , in fact , that ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's voice 
ProtagonistA had been reading aloud from the ' History of the United States of America ' when ProtagonistA noticed a word in a Latin text on the back page 
 ProtagonistA wondered if the word meant ' forever ' in Latin , and if so , whether ProtagonistB had known that ProtagonistA would one day be reading about the history of the United States in a Latin text 
ProtagonistA approached the throne upon an armchair not as a king , but as a dandy , ProtagonistA a success , but no more than a short - cut , with ProtagonistB at full term , ProtagonistA sat down to lunch , and took a stool in the sofas on the other side of the table 
 ProtagonistA had been planning to leave ProtagonistB for weeks , but now that ProtagonistB was pregnant , ProtagonistA did n't have the heart to do it 
 So ProtagonistA sat there , eating ProtagonistA's lunch and looking at ProtagonistB , wondering how ProtagonistA could ever leave ProtagonistB 
There was once ProtagonistA , for there can be no doubt that it was to ProtagonistA a kind of great privilege and a great misfortune that ProtagonistA was to have lived until the day ProtagonistA died a free man 
 When ProtagonistA was sixteen , ProtagonistA ran away from home and joined the army 
 ProtagonistA served ProtagonistA's country for four years , and then ProtagonistA was honorably discharged 
 ProtagonistA returned home , but ProtagonistA could not find a place in society 
 ProtagonistA was a man without a country , without a home 
 ProtagonistA wandered the streets , living off the charity of others 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA went to the address ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA at the doorstep of a brothel 
 ProtagonistA went inside , and ProtagonistA was given a room and a bed 
 ProtagonistA was happy there , and ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA had found a home 
 It was a miracle that ProtagonistA was , considering all that ProtagonistA 'd been through in ProtagonistA's short life 
 But ProtagonistA did 
 But ProtagonistA fought and ProtagonistA survived 
 Then , just last year , ProtagonistA was in a terrible car accident 
 ProtagonistA should have died then , but somehow ProtagonistA made it through 
 Now , here ProtagonistA was , alive and well , despite all the odds 
 ProtagonistA was a fighter , and ProtagonistA was grateful for every day that ProtagonistA was alive 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had been through more than most people , and that ProtagonistA was lucky to be alive 
 ProtagonistA was determined to make the most of ProtagonistA's life , and to help others who were fighting their own battles 
 ProtagonistA wanted to show people that anything was possible , and that miracles could happen 
 ProtagonistA was an inspiration to everyone who met ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was living proof that hope and determination could overcome anything 
 ProtagonistA was a walking miracle , and ProtagonistA was going to make the most of every single day 
 For the first time , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB leave the house , bundled up in a heavy coat and scarf 
 ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistB walked down the street , looking around at the snow - covered houses and trees 
 ProtagonistA was curious to know what had prompted ProtagonistB to finally leave the house after all these years 
 ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB at a distance , not wanting to intrude on whatever it was that ProtagonistB was doing 
 ProtagonistA was surprised when ProtagonistB turned down a street that ProtagonistA had never been down before 
 ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB , but this time ProtagonistB did n't seem to notice ProtagonistA 
 It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever seen ProtagonistB leave the house , and ProtagonistA was n't sure what to make of it 
 Was it the first step of ProtagonistB coming out of ProtagonistB's shell , or was it simply a one - time thing ? Either way , ProtagonistA was happy to have seen ProtagonistB finally venture out into the world 
ProtagonistA was always different 
 ProtagonistA did n't share a room with your mom or your brother or any of that stuff that everybody does 
 ProtagonistA was always alone , and ProtagonistA liked it that way 
 ProtagonistA did n't need anybody else 
 ProtagonistA met somebody who changed ProtagonistA's whole perspective on life 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA did n't want to be alone anymore 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be with this person all the time 
ProtagonistA lay in ProtagonistA's white cotton dress , looking out through the bars at the stars overhead , and the old King of the Hill of the Meadow , the abbot of the church of St
 ProtagonistA had been lying there for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had been brought to this place , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never leave it alive 
 ProtagonistA thought back over ProtagonistA's life , all the way back to when ProtagonistA was a child 
 ProtagonistA remembered ProtagonistA's mother and father , and ProtagonistA's sister 
 ProtagonistA remembered the first time ProtagonistA saw the stars , and the first time ProtagonistA heard the birds singing 
 ProtagonistA remembered all the good times and the bad times , and ProtagonistA knew that , despite it all , ProtagonistA had lived a good life 
 Now , as ProtagonistA lay there waiting for the end , ProtagonistA thought of all the people ProtagonistA had known and all the things ProtagonistA had done 
 And ProtagonistA knew that , even though ProtagonistA's life was about to end , ProtagonistA had been truly blessed 
ProtagonistA stands on ProtagonistA's brook and watches the sun set over a wide and blue sea of gold 
 ProtagonistA thinks to ProtagonistA how beautiful it is and how lucky ProtagonistA is to have such a view 
 ProtagonistA feels the cool breeze on ProtagonistA's face and hears the sound of the waves crashing against the shore 
 ProtagonistA takes a deep breath and feels the peace of the moment 
 ProtagonistA was going to take the first step to making ProtagonistA's dreams come true 
 ProtagonistA knew they would all support ProtagonistA's decision , but ProtagonistA also knew that it would be hard for them to see ProtagonistA go 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and stood up , ready to start ProtagonistA's new life 
ProtagonistA had forgotten how long ProtagonistA 'd been in the desert 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , trying to find ProtagonistA's way back to civilization , but ProtagonistA was lost 
 ProtagonistA stumbled and fell to ProtagonistA's knees , crawling forward a few more feet before collapsing 
 ProtagonistA lay there , gasping for breath , before everything went black 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA was in a hospital bed 
 ProtagonistA had no idea how ProtagonistA got there , but ProtagonistA was relieved to be out of the desert 
 ProtagonistA had been unconscious for days , and they were not sure if ProtagonistA was going to make it 
 ProtagonistA was amazed that ProtagonistA had survived and was incredibly grateful to be alive 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the foot of a large tree in the shadow of an old oak tree , spreading ProtagonistA's wings 
 ProtagonistA was a large bird , and ProtagonistA's wings were strong 
 ProtagonistA had been sitting in the same spot for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting tired 
 But ProtagonistA did n't want to move 
 ProtagonistA liked the way the sun felt on ProtagonistA's feathers , and ProtagonistA liked the way the breeze ruffled ProtagonistA's feathers 
 ProtagonistA was content 
ProtagonistA laid ProtagonistA's hooves on ProtagonistA's forelegs and stared up at the sky 
 It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was happy to be alive 
 ProtagonistA thought about all the things ProtagonistA had been through in ProtagonistA's life , and how far ProtagonistA had come 
 ProtagonistA was grateful for all the good times , and even the bad times , because they had made ProtagonistA who ProtagonistA was today 
ProtagonistA can not be quite sure which was which , but ProtagonistA had seen the end of it 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it 
 ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way home from a hike when ProtagonistA saw it 
 ProtagonistA had been planning to camp out for the night , but now ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to get home 
 ProtagonistA had to tell someone about what ProtagonistA had seen 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA could barely contain ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA ran all the way home , and when ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA's family about the beautiful sunset ProtagonistA had seen 
 ProtagonistA will never forget that sunset 
ProtagonistA was having a tough day 
 ProtagonistA reached over to cup ProtagonistA's eyes to see just how dry and teary they were , and ProtagonistA was surprised to see that they were actually quite dry 
 ProtagonistA decided to put some drops in ProtagonistA's eyes to help them feel better 
ProtagonistA was getting tired from all the running around 
 ProtagonistA had been chasing rabbits all day and was ready to take a break 
 ProtagonistA stretched out ProtagonistA's forelegs and rested ProtagonistA's hind legs on the side of ProtagonistA's neck 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and enjoyed the warm sun on ProtagonistA's fur 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw a rabbit right in front of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA quickly got up and chased after it 
 ProtagonistA was n't going to let this one get away ! 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner 
 ProtagonistA never really fit in with any one group and always seemed to be on the outside looking in 
ProtagonistA had always dreamed of a rainbow , whenever nopony was around to explain it to ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA asked a passing pony what it was 
 ProtagonistA was amazed and could n't wait to see one for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches , staring into the distance 
 ProtagonistA had been on the lookout for hours , but there was no sign of the game ProtagonistA was tracking 
 Just as ProtagonistA was about to give up and turn back , ProtagonistA saw a movement in the bushes 
 ProtagonistA tensed , silent and waiting for the kill 
ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's own set of sparrow feet 
 ProtagonistA would carefully take them out each night to admire them in the moonlight before putting them away again in their special box 
 One night , as ProtagonistA was admiring ProtagonistA's feet , ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes 
 ProtagonistA was sure that someone was watching ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was about to be found out 
 ProtagonistA quickly put ProtagonistA's feet away and ran inside , heart pounding 
 The next day , ProtagonistA went back to the spot where ProtagonistA had seen the rustling 
 ProtagonistA found a pair of sparrow feet , just like ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to have found another person with the same special feet 
 ProtagonistA and the other person with sparrow feet became good friends 
ProtagonistA was getting impatient 
 ProtagonistA had been waiting for hours , and still no sign of the baby 
 ProtagonistA quickly delivered the baby and went on ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA soon began to think of them as ProtagonistA's parents , and ProtagonistA was very happy with ProtagonistA's new life 
ProtagonistA was having a great day 
 ProtagonistA woke up early and went for a run , then ate a healthy breakfast 
 ProtagonistA was about to head out the door when ProtagonistA got a call from ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA agreed , and within an hour , ProtagonistB was at ProtagonistA's door 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong , but ProtagonistB did n't answer 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistB had tried to kill ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB why , but ProtagonistB did n't have an answer 
 But ProtagonistA do n't think ProtagonistA can ever forget what ProtagonistB did 
ProtagonistA was sitting on ProtagonistA's bed , knitting a sweater for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been working on it for weeks , and it was finally finished 
 ProtagonistA was just about to put the finishing touches on it when ProtagonistA heard a knock at ProtagonistA's door 
 ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and there was ProtagonistB , standing there with a big smile on ProtagonistB's face 
 ProtagonistA sat back down on ProtagonistA's bed , a satisfied smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA grew up to be a happy , healthy boy 
 ProtagonistA loved spending time with ProtagonistA's parents and loved hearing stories about when they were younger 
 As ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA started to realize how much ProtagonistA's parents loved ProtagonistA and how much they had sacrificed for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was lucky to have such amazing parents who loved ProtagonistA unconditionally 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was grown up and had children of ProtagonistA's own , ProtagonistA was sitting with ProtagonistA's own family , telling stories about ProtagonistA's childhood 
 ProtagonistA told them about the cold winter day when ProtagonistA was born and how much ProtagonistA's parents loved ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA spoke , ProtagonistA realized how grateful ProtagonistA was to have such a loving family 
 ProtagonistA knew that , no matter what happened in life , ProtagonistA could always count on ProtagonistA's parents to be there for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA looked down at the floor of ProtagonistA's hooves , at ProtagonistA's feet , and the strands of pink hair hanging above ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA was a bit self - conscious about ProtagonistA's hair , but ProtagonistA loved the way it looked 
 ProtagonistA was also self - conscious about ProtagonistA's hooves , but ProtagonistA loved the way they looked too 
 ProtagonistA was a bit self - conscious about ProtagonistA's body , but ProtagonistA loved the way it looked 
 ProtagonistA was a bit self - conscious about ProtagonistA's life , but ProtagonistA loved the way it looked 
ProtagonistA was sitting cross - legged on the edge of the porch , ProtagonistA's eyes fixed on the tree closest to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 've been sitting out here for a while , and ProtagonistB was starting to worry 
 ProtagonistA smiled 
 Well , ProtagonistA be sure to come inside if ProtagonistA get too hot 
 ProtagonistA will 
 ProtagonistA turned back to the tree , and ProtagonistB went back inside ProtagonistB's house 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistA's son , Tim 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistA's daughter , Emily 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA smiled 
 Well , ProtagonistA be sure to come inside if ProtagonistA get too cold 
 ProtagonistA will 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA smiled 
 Well , ProtagonistA be sure to come inside if ProtagonistA get too cold 
 ProtagonistA will 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA smiled 
 Well , ProtagonistA be sure to come inside if ProtagonistA get too cold 
 ProtagonistA will 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistA's son , Tim 
 ProtagonistA smiled 
ProtagonistA peered down through the low ceiling of ProtagonistA's office as though ProtagonistA had been watching a war for hours 
 ProtagonistA had been watching the war for weeks , ever since it had begun 
 ProtagonistA had seen it all before , and ProtagonistA knew that it would only end in tragedy 
 ProtagonistA had tried to warn the gang members , but they would n't listen 
 ProtagonistA sighed and rubbed ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA was getting too old for this 
 ProtagonistA had seen too much violence , and ProtagonistA just wanted it to end 
 Maybe ProtagonistA could retire soon and move to the beach 
 ProtagonistA could just sit and watch the waves crash against the shore 
 ProtagonistA jumped up and ran to the window 
 ProtagonistA peered out and saw that a car had crashed into a building 
 ProtagonistA watched as the flames grew higher and higher 
 ProtagonistA knew that there would be more violence tonight 
 ProtagonistA just hoped that it would end soon 
ProtagonistA stared at the floor , ProtagonistA's eyes darting from one simple idea to another 
 ProtagonistA was trying to think of a way to get out of this mess 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to jail 
 ProtagonistA was desperate to find a way out 
 ProtagonistA could pretend to be crazy 
 ProtagonistA could act like ProtagonistA was having a mental breakdown 
 ProtagonistA started to pace back and forth , muttering to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knocked over a chair and started to bang ProtagonistA's head against the wall 
 ProtagonistA had avoided going to jail 
 But ProtagonistA was also now a patient in a mental hospital 
ProtagonistA had always been a bookworm , so it was no surprise that ProtagonistA's favorite spot to relax was in ProtagonistA's library 
 ProtagonistA had every book imaginable , and ProtagonistA loved them all equally 
 But as ProtagonistA sat there , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little sad 
 ProtagonistA was always the one who was short on time , and ProtagonistA never had enough time to read all of ProtagonistA's books 
 But ProtagonistA was content , because at least ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a horse who loved to dance 
 ProtagonistA would stand up on ProtagonistA's hooves and pull ProtagonistA's head back with one hoof whenever ProtagonistA heard music 
 ProtagonistA loved to feel the wind blowing through ProtagonistA's mane and the sun on ProtagonistA's face 
 One day , ProtagonistA heard the most beautiful music ProtagonistA had ever heard 
 As ProtagonistA danced , ProtagonistA felt something magical happen 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA becoming lighter and lighter , until ProtagonistA was floating in the air!He looked down and saw that ProtagonistA's hooves were no longer touching the ground 
 ProtagonistA was floating above the field , and the music was coming from a group of fairies who were dancing below ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had never felt so happy in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA danced and danced , until ProtagonistA finally fell asleep , floating in the air , with the music of the fairies surrounding ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA remembered when ProtagonistA started at Equestria 
 ProtagonistA worked long hours , but ProtagonistA loved it 
 ProtagonistA soon became the head groom and was responsible for the care of the horses 
 ProtagonistA worked hard to make sure they were healthy and happy 
 ProtagonistA was always available to answer any questions the owners had about their horses 
 ProtagonistA was a trusted member of the team and was loved by the horses 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked out at the moon 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's family , and ProtagonistA missed the life ProtagonistA used to have 
 But ProtagonistA was content here , in the forest , with the animals as ProtagonistA's company 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was lucky to have found this place , and ProtagonistA was grateful for it 
ProtagonistA lay down on ProtagonistA's hooves and reached for ProtagonistA's glass of juice 
 However , as ProtagonistA reached for ProtagonistA's glass , ProtagonistA realized that it was empty 
 ProtagonistA sighed and got up to get a refill 
 ProtagonistA had just moved in and was excited to start ProtagonistA's new life 
 ProtagonistA had never been a fan of the rain and now ProtagonistA was living in a place where it rains a lot 
 ProtagonistA was worried that ProtagonistA's new house would flood 
 But , ProtagonistA was also excited to be living in such a beautiful place 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would get used to it 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches , contemplating ProtagonistA's drawing card 
 ProtagonistA had spent hours upon hours perfecting it , and now it was finally finished 
 ProtagonistA held the card up to the light , admiring the way the lines caught the light and glowed 
 ProtagonistA stood up , carefully tucking the card into ProtagonistA's pocket , and walked out into the world , a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
ProtagonistA was having one of ProtagonistA's many sleepless nights 
 ProtagonistA got up and went to the window to see if the moon was still there 
 ProtagonistA went back to bed and tried to sleep , but ProtagonistA could n't 
 ProtagonistA got up and looked out the window again , but the moon was still gone 
 ProtagonistA went downstairs and turned on the TV , but there was nothing on 
 ProtagonistA turned on the lights , but they did n't work 
 ProtagonistA went outside to see if the moon was back , but it was n't 
One morning , ProtagonistA was lying in a pool of ProtagonistA's own blood 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to die soon , but ProtagonistA was determined to find out who had done this to ProtagonistA 
 With ProtagonistA's last bit of strength , ProtagonistA crawled to the phone and called the police 
 ProtagonistA told them what had happened and who ProtagonistA thought the killer was 
 Then ProtagonistA died 
 But ProtagonistA just kept spinning , faster and faster , until ProtagonistA was a blur 
 Finally , ProtagonistA stopped and collapsed to the ground , panting 
 ProtagonistB rushed to ProtagonistA's side , but ProtagonistA just laughed and said ,  That was fun ! Can ProtagonistA do it again ?  
ProtagonistA had been wearing the same blank expression for weeks now , and ProtagonistA was starting to get sick of it 
 ProtagonistA wanted to try something new , but ProtagonistA was n't sure what 
 How am ProtagonistA going to wear it without looking like an idiot ?  ProtagonistA decided to experiment with different facial expressions and see what worked best 
 After a few days of trying out different expressions , ProtagonistA finally found the perfect one 
 Now ProtagonistA can go out in public without looking like an idiot ! 
ProtagonistA looked over the balcony at the endless blue sky , filled , in ProtagonistA's opinion , with the most beautiful white foals , and sighed 
 Maybe one day ProtagonistA would be able to escape this place and live among the foals , but for now ProtagonistA was stuck here 
ProtagonistA swallowed a large melty gulp of ProtagonistA's new favorite drink which was no doubt ProtagonistA's seventh 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could run a marathon after just a few sips 
 ProtagonistA loved the feeling and ProtagonistA chugged the drink down as fast as ProtagonistA could 
 Even when ProtagonistA was at ProtagonistA's worst , ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA 
 It was because of this that ProtagonistA was able to get through some of the hardest times in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA is grateful for ProtagonistB's guidance and support throughout ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes and ProtagonistB had been pacing the downstairs hallway for hours , still staring up at the giant dragon sitting on the doorstep 
 ProtagonistA sighed 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was n't going to budge until ProtagonistB got ProtagonistB's cupcake , so ProtagonistA might as well give in and get ProtagonistB's one 
 ProtagonistA went to the kitchen and got a cupcake from the cupcake tree 
 ProtagonistA just shook ProtagonistA's head and went back to the kitchen 
 ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes and ProtagonistB had a dragon on the doorstep , but at least ProtagonistB was happy 
Sometime in the early seventies ProtagonistA was working at a dress shop when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB working there 
 One day , ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB how ProtagonistB liked working at the dress shop 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to hear this and asked ProtagonistB why ProtagonistB liked it so much 
 ProtagonistB said yes and ProtagonistA was happy to have ProtagonistB on board 
From the top of a high mountain , ProtagonistA , naturally , waited for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be coming soon and ProtagonistA wanted to be the first one to greet ProtagonistB 
 As ProtagonistA waited , ProtagonistA could n't help but think about all the things they had been through together 
 ProtagonistA remembered the time when they were both lost in the forest and how ProtagonistB had found the way back home 
 ProtagonistA also remembered the time when ProtagonistB had saved ProtagonistA from a group of bullies 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was always there for ProtagonistA , no matter what 
 Finally , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB coming up the path 
 I'm glad to see ProtagonistB too , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA was tired from ProtagonistA's journey and wanted to rest , but ProtagonistA could not 
 ProtagonistA was too anxious about what lay ahead 
 ProtagonistA had to be brave 
 ProtagonistA stood up and continued ProtagonistA's search 
One morning , ProtagonistA woke up in the middle of the night , and there was a pony standing over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
  ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA jumped out of bed and followed the pony out of ProtagonistA's house 
ProtagonistA lay down on ProtagonistA's hooves and reached for ProtagonistA's glass of juice 
 ProtagonistA was tired from a long day of work and was looking forward to a refreshing drink 
 However , when ProtagonistA took a sip , ProtagonistA realized that the juice was sour and had gone bad 
 Disappointed , ProtagonistA put the glass back down and went to bed 
ProtagonistA bent down and peered up into the oak tree that sheltered ProtagonistA from the wind 
 ProtagonistA saw a squirrel perched on a branch , eating an acorn 
 ProtagonistA watched the squirrel for a while , admiring its agility 
 ProtagonistA laughed and stood up 
 ProtagonistA was about to continue on ProtagonistA's walk when ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the leaves above ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA looked up and saw the squirrel looking down at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA smiled and walked away , feeling grateful for the moment of connection ProtagonistA had experienced with the squirrel 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's heels on the edge of a wide open field and peered down into the quiet green valley below 
 ProtagonistA had been hiking all day , and ProtagonistA was tired 
 But ProtagonistA was also excited , because ProtagonistA knew that down in that valley was a secret hidden treasure 
 ProtagonistA had been searching for the treasure for weeks , and ProtagonistA was getting close 
 ProtagonistA was sure that it was hidden somewhere in that valley 
 ProtagonistA just had to find it 
 ProtagonistA scanned the valley carefully , looking for any clues that might lead ProtagonistA to the treasure 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was getting close 
 ProtagonistA scrambled down the hillside , eager to find more coins 
 ProtagonistA followed the trail of coins until ProtagonistA came to a small cave 
 And there , in the back of the cave , ProtagonistA found the treasure 
 ProtagonistA could hardly believe ProtagonistA's eyes 
ProtagonistA looked up at the sun , and wondered if ProtagonistA wanted to leave the Equestrian capital anytime soon 
 ProtagonistA loved the city , but sometimes ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was suffocating 
 ProtagonistA could pack up ProtagonistA's things and head out west , to the open plains 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to see the world , and there was no time like the present 
 ProtagonistA made up ProtagonistA's mind and started packing ProtagonistA's bags 
 ProtagonistA was going to leave the city and start a new adventure 
ProtagonistA had just finished eating dinner with ProtagonistA's family and was walking down the aisle of the car park of the local church when the first thing ProtagonistA noticed was ProtagonistB looking back at ProtagonistA from the rear window 
 ProtagonistA agreed to help , and the two of them walked to ProtagonistB's car 
 ProtagonistA agreed to help ProtagonistB get the story published 
ProtagonistA had been thinking all day if ProtagonistA 'd ever had the chance to speak to ProtagonistB again 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB dearly and regretted not speaking to ProtagonistB more often when ProtagonistB was alive 
 ProtagonistA was so grateful to have the chance to speak to ProtagonistB again and tell ProtagonistB how much ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a lot of things , but most ponies did n't know just how kind ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA was always quick with a smile and a joke , and ProtagonistA was always willing to help out a friend in need 
 ProtagonistA was always helping out those less fortunate than ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA always went out of ProtagonistA's way to make sure everypony was happy 
 ProtagonistA was the kind of pony that made everypony around ProtagonistA better , and that was why ProtagonistA was loved by so many 
ProtagonistA was lying in bed , trying to sleep 
 ProtagonistA pulled the covers up to ProtagonistA's chin and tried to relax , but ProtagonistA's mind was racing 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about the new project ProtagonistA was starting at work tomorrow and whether or not ProtagonistA was going to be able to handle it 
 ProtagonistA was also thinking about the fight ProtagonistA had with ProtagonistA's girlfriend earlier that evening 
 ProtagonistA sighed and rolled over , trying to get comfortable 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistA finally fell asleep 
ProtagonistA had never been a particularly violent person 
 In fact , in ProtagonistA's younger and more vulnerable years , ProtagonistA had never held a weapon above ProtagonistA's head 
 Now , ProtagonistA was no longer a pushover 
 ProtagonistA was a man to be reckoned with 
ProtagonistA was a small horse who loved to look at the stars 
 ProtagonistA would sit on ProtagonistA's cardboard box in the field and just stare up at the sky 
 ProtagonistA loved the way the stars twinkled and the way the moon shone 
 ProtagonistA felt safe and loved under the blanket of stars 
In the eagerness of ProtagonistA's youth , ProtagonistA had known exactly what ProtagonistA was destined to become 
 ProtagonistA was going to be a great musician 
 ProtagonistA was going to be a world - famous rock star 
 ProtagonistA was going to be a rich and famous man 
 But as ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA's dream was not going to come true 
 ProtagonistA was not going to be a rock star 
 ProtagonistA was not going to be rich and famous 
 ProtagonistA was just going to be a regular guy 
 Because even though ProtagonistA's dream did n't come true , ProtagonistA was still able to live a happy and fulfilling life 
One morning , as the sun was leaking its last faint rays , ProtagonistA heard the bell ring , and while ProtagonistA was still in the kitchen preparing the breakfast that ProtagonistA 'd have for ProtagonistA's grandkids for the holidays , ProtagonistA was n't looking out of the kitchen window 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and went back inside , thinking ProtagonistA must be getting old and senile 
 But then ProtagonistA noticed that the window in the living room was open , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had n't left it that way 
 ProtagonistA quickly ran to the window and looked out , but there was no sign of anyone 
 ProtagonistA was about to call the police when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the kitchen 
 Someone was still in ProtagonistA's house ! ProtagonistA crept quietly towards the kitchen , heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest , and peeked around the corner 
 ProtagonistA was about to call out to ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB suddenly turned around , and their eyes met 
 ProtagonistA was just glad ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistA went to the window and looked out one last time , but there was still no sign of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA sighed and went back to the kitchen to finish making breakfast for ProtagonistA's grandkids 
ProtagonistA peered into the mirror at ProtagonistA's reflection , gem eyes shining with anticipation 
 ProtagonistA had planned and planned for months , and everything was lined up perfectly 
 ProtagonistA was going to rob the city 's prized diamond store and make off with the biggest haul in history 
 ProtagonistA had the perfect disguise , the perfect plan , and the perfect getaway car 
 ProtagonistA just had to execute it perfectly 
 ProtagonistA took one last look at ProtagonistA in the mirror and then headed out the door 
 ProtagonistA got to the store and everything went according to plan 
 ProtagonistA was in and out in under a minute and had the diamonds in ProtagonistA's possession 
 ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way to the getaway car , but just as ProtagonistA was about to get in , ProtagonistA was surrounded by police 
 As ProtagonistA was being led away in handcuffs , ProtagonistA could n't help but think about what could have been 
 If ProtagonistA had just been a little bit more careful , ProtagonistA could have gotten away with it 
 But now , ProtagonistA was facing a long prison sentence 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the living room of ProtagonistA's house in the suburbs of Ponyville , the fresh air of ProtagonistA's fresh - pitch garden bringing out blue - green flowers that bloomed all afternoon and remained crisp and green all night 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a loud crash from outside 
 ProtagonistA got up to investigate and saw that ProtagonistA's neighbor 's house was on fire ! Without thinking any further , ProtagonistA ran into the burning house to save ProtagonistA's neighbor 
 ProtagonistA was able to get them out safely , but ProtagonistA sustained some burns in the process 
 ProtagonistA was a hero , and ProtagonistA's neighbor was forever grateful 
ProtagonistA was in the middle of an assignment when all of a sudden , ProtagonistA had the appearance of a forty - year - old animal 
 ProtagonistA finished ProtagonistA's assignment quickly and then went to the library to do some research on animals 
 ProtagonistA learned all about their habits and how to care for them 
 ProtagonistA even found a job at a zoo 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's new life and was grateful to have the appearance of an animal 
ProtagonistA was riding ProtagonistA's horse down Mount Fouladuddy when it happened 
 ProtagonistA was having a quite a pleasant ride , taking in the scenery and enjoying the fresh air 
 ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistA's head on a rock and was knocked unconscious 
 When ProtagonistA came to , ProtagonistA was lying in a heap at the bottom of the mountain , with ProtagonistA's horse nowhere to be seen 
 ProtagonistA was lucky to be alive , but ProtagonistA was going to have to find a way back up the mountain if ProtagonistA ever wanted to see ProtagonistA's horse again 
ProtagonistA sat down on the edge of the desk , and looked around for ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA saw them all sitting in their usual spots , and ProtagonistA felt a warmth in ProtagonistA's chest 
 ProtagonistA was glad to be back in school with ProtagonistA's friends 
ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistA 'd be better off dead 
 ProtagonistA was tired of living in a world that was constantly filled with pain and suffering 
 ProtagonistA had lost all hope that things would ever get better 
 So , ProtagonistA decided to end ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA took a bottle of pills and swallowed them all 
 Then , ProtagonistA lay down in ProtagonistA's bed and waited to die 
 But , ProtagonistA did n't die 
 ProtagonistA vomited them all up and was left alive 
 ProtagonistA had wanted to die , but fate had other plans for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 's laughing ProtagonistA's butt off 
 ProtagonistB 's just standing there , looking at ProtagonistA like ProtagonistA 's crazy 
 ProtagonistA 's just happy to be there , with ProtagonistB , in the moment 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day 
 First , ProtagonistA overslept and was late for ProtagonistA's job at the farm 
 To top it all off , when ProtagonistA went to go sit down for lunch , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had forgotten ProtagonistA's lunch box at home 
 ProtagonistA was so hungry and frustrated , ProtagonistA just wanted to sit down and rest ProtagonistA's hooves on the back of ProtagonistA's head 
 But then ProtagonistA remembered ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's lunch box at home 
 With a groan , ProtagonistA got up and trudged back to the farm to get ProtagonistA's lunch box 
ProtagonistA got up before dawn and stepped away from the distractions of ProtagonistA's city 
 ProtagonistA walked for miles , until ProtagonistA reached a small stream 
 ProtagonistA sat down and watched the sun rise , and for the first time in a long time , ProtagonistA felt at peace 
ProtagonistA lay down on ProtagonistA's hooves and reached for ProtagonistA's glass of juice 
 ProtagonistA was a little horse , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's juice 
 ProtagonistA drank it all the time 
 But today , ProtagonistA did n't feel so good 
 ProtagonistA tried to drink ProtagonistA's juice , but ProtagonistA could n't keep it down 
 ProtagonistA lay there for a while , feeling sick 
 Then ProtagonistA heard someone coming 
 Soon , ProtagonistA was back to drinking ProtagonistA's juice and being ProtagonistA's happy self again 
ProtagonistA was asleep and thinking about food when ProtagonistA awoke to the sound of hooves approaching from behind the deep , dark , still trees of Equestria 
 ProtagonistA slowly stood up , ProtagonistA's stomach grumbling , and turned to see ProtagonistB trotting towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA sat down and began munching on the juicy apples , feeling grateful for ProtagonistB's help 
ProtagonistA had had enough of telling ProtagonistB's story for a while now 
 ProtagonistA had heard it so many times that ProtagonistA could recite it ProtagonistA 
 And every time , ProtagonistA would oblige 
 But today , ProtagonistA had had enough 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to hear the story again 
 ProtagonistA wanted to do something else 
 ProtagonistA 'm tired of it 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to hurt ProtagonistB's feelings 
 And so , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB spent the day doing other things together 
ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistA 'd be better off dead 
 ProtagonistA was tired of fighting and just wanted to give up 
 ProtagonistA decided to take a bottle of pills and end it all 
 ProtagonistA wrote a note to ProtagonistA's family and took the pills 
ProtagonistA smiled as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistA's father wash his hands in the sink , then rise to the counter and give Applejack a knowing nod 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's father was proud of ProtagonistA for taking care of the farm while ProtagonistA was away at college , and ProtagonistA was glad to be able to help out 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a dirty , ragged tunic , and ProtagonistA's hair was matted and greasy 
 ProtagonistA looked like a wild animal , and the crowd jeered and booed as ProtagonistA was led to the stand 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was innocent , and ProtagonistA was determined to prove it 
  ProtagonistA am innocent of all charges !  ProtagonistA shouted 
 ProtagonistA are just as guilty as ProtagonistB was 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head 
  No , ProtagonistA am not ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA swear , on ProtagonistA's honor , that ProtagonistA am innocent 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had done nothing wrong , and ProtagonistA was determined to prove ProtagonistA's innocence 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and watched from behind the large , open window of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been following the herd of wild horses for days , and they had finally led ProtagonistA to their hidden valley 
 Now ProtagonistA just had to wait for the right moment to make ProtagonistA's move 
 ProtagonistA watched as the herd grazed and played , their bodies shining in the sunlight 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would have to be careful , as these horses were wild and unpredictable 
 But ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA could not let this opportunity pass ProtagonistA by 
 Finally , when the herd was resting in the shade of a grove of trees , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's move 
 ProtagonistA quietly approached ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA slowly reached out ProtagonistA's hand to touch ProtagonistB's soft nose , and ProtagonistB did not shy away 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's new home 
ProtagonistA stood up and stretched out ProtagonistA's forelegs 
 ProtagonistA yawned and stretched ProtagonistA's arms above ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA had slept so late 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head to clear the sleep from ProtagonistA's eyes and looked around 
 ProtagonistA sighed and started to clean up the mess 
ProtagonistA had seen the white sapland before , but ProtagonistA had n't known what it was , or why people did what they did 
 ProtagonistA had always thought it was just a place where people went to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city 
 But one day , ProtagonistA found out the truth 
 ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was amazed by what ProtagonistA heard , and ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been missing out on something special 
 From then on , ProtagonistA made it a point to visit the sapland every chance ProtagonistA got , and ProtagonistA even started to bring friends and family with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so distraught that ProtagonistA did n't even notice the man standing there with a camera until ProtagonistB was gone 
ProtagonistA has been fishing on the Queen 's second moon for years 
 ProtagonistA knows every nook and cranny of the place 
 Tonight , ProtagonistA 's feeling lucky 
 ProtagonistA 's not sure what ProtagonistA 's going to do with the fish ProtagonistA catches , but ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA 'll be able to sell it for a good price 
 ProtagonistA can see the alder - maiden in the distance , and ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA 's getting close to ProtagonistA's goal 
 ProtagonistA can feel the tension in the net , and ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA 's got something 
 ProtagonistA starts to pull in the net , and ProtagonistA can see the fish struggling to get free 
 ProtagonistA 's not going to let this one go 
 ProtagonistA finally gets the fish to the shore , and ProtagonistA ca n't believe ProtagonistA's eyes 
ProtagonistA rode into the door of the guild hall and pulled her whip out of ProtagonistA's saddlebag 
  ProtagonistA 'm here to join the guild ,  ProtagonistA said 
  What 's ProtagonistA's class ?   ProtagonistA 'm a whip user ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 've been adventuring for years 
  ProtagonistA can fill out this form and we 'll get ProtagonistA started 
  ProtagonistA filled out the form and joined the guild 
 It is a mystery to many who understand the nature of things , that ProtagonistA shines so pale in summer , and so bright in winter , and so clear in the summer , that ProtagonistA sometimes appears to be cradling a corn - field in ProtagonistA's arms 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the bank , searching for ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA had been out all day , and was getting tired 
 ProtagonistA had seen many fish , but no sign of ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up and go home , when ProtagonistA saw a fish jump out of the water 
 ProtagonistA followed the fish with ProtagonistA's eyes , and saw it jump into a bush 
 ProtagonistA got up and walked over to the bush , and there ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's friends , fast asleep 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the couch in the living room of a house in the middle of nowhere , drinking a glass of water which ProtagonistA hoped would last through the night 
 ProtagonistA was tired , but ProtagonistA could n't sleep 
 ProtagonistA had been on the run for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to feel safe 
 ProtagonistA had found this house a few days ago , and it had seemed like the perfect place to hide 
 But now , in the middle of the night , ProtagonistA was starting to feel like it was a trap 
 ProtagonistA was getting paranoid , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to sleep , but ProtagonistA just could n't 
 ProtagonistA heard a noise outside , and ProtagonistA tensed up 
 ProtagonistA was about to get up to investigate when ProtagonistA heard a voice 
  ProtagonistA relaxed when ProtagonistA recognized the voice of ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB were dead ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA had taken a rest from ProtagonistA's long and busy life , and now that ProtagonistA was free of the cares of being a wife and mother , ProtagonistA was content to enjoy the moment of happiness which ProtagonistA had prepared for just such an occasion 
 ProtagonistA had a picnic lunch all packed and ready to go , and ProtagonistA set off down the path towards the river , where ProtagonistA had always wanted to go fishing 
 ProtagonistA did n't catch any fish , but ProtagonistA did n't mind 
The first time ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB , when ProtagonistA had been a boy called Spike , ProtagonistA had been playing in the park with ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA had thought that ProtagonistB was really cool , and ProtagonistA had been excited to talk to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had a stick and a torch , and ProtagonistA used to dream of a land where ProtagonistA might live happily ever after with ProtagonistA's loving husband and beautiful little daughter and little son 
 One day , ProtagonistA found a doorway to that land , and ProtagonistA stepped through it 
 ProtagonistA was amazed at the beauty of the place , and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA in the company of ProtagonistA's husband and children 
ProtagonistA stood up and brushed her bangs off ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA had been sitting in the same spot for hours , and ProtagonistA's back was starting to hurt 
 ProtagonistA looked at the girl next to ProtagonistA , who was fast asleep , and then at the empty seat across the aisle 
 ProtagonistA sighed and stood up , stretching ProtagonistA's arms above ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA walked to the seat across the aisle and sat down , leaning ProtagonistA's head back against the headrest 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let out a deep breath , feeling the tension leave ProtagonistA's body 
ProtagonistA stood in the shadow of ProtagonistB's dusty glass cabinet , ProtagonistA's hooves hanging down on the peg to keep the right eye steady 
 ProtagonistA had been in the same position for hours , waiting for ProtagonistB to come home from work 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would be tired and would n't want to talk , but ProtagonistA had to tell ProtagonistB what had happened 
 ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistC when ProtagonistA went out to look for ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA stood there , not knowing what to do , until ProtagonistB finally got up and hugged ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes 
 ProtagonistA had been long and rambling , and had a lot to address 
 ProtagonistA seemed to be enjoying ProtagonistA , coming up with new and creative ways to torture me 
ProtagonistA watched from the front porch as ProtagonistA's parents put the finishing touches to their house 
 ProtagonistA knew that someday ProtagonistA would have a family of ProtagonistA's own and ProtagonistA would want to make a home for them just like ProtagonistA's parents had done for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was one of the most distinguished ladies of the abbey of St
 ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's late baccus the eldest of the four daughters of the house 
 Though ProtagonistA's mother and grandmother had been very obscure in their regard to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had often thought ProtagonistA's grandfather a pretty poor particular , but in ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA had been extremely wretched , and altogether destitute of everything ProtagonistA should have been able to procure for ProtagonistA 
 And after ProtagonistA's grandmother 's death , being very deprived of money , and very poor indeed , ProtagonistA had nothing but ProtagonistA's imagination in ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was on the pedestal of ProtagonistB's bed , drooping down and frowning as ProtagonistA stared up at the stars 
 ProtagonistA was bored out of ProtagonistA's mind , and the only thing that was keeping ProtagonistA from flying away was the hope that ProtagonistB would come back soon 
 ProtagonistA perked up immediately , and flew over to ProtagonistB 
  Where have ProtagonistB been ?  ProtagonistA demanded 
  ProtagonistA was starting to think ProtagonistB forgot about ProtagonistB laughed and ruffled ProtagonistA's mane 
  Yeah , they are ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA guess ProtagonistA should n't have been so worried 
 ProtagonistA 're ProtagonistB's best friend 
ProtagonistA was staring up at ProtagonistA's book , dazed and wondering when ProtagonistA would get the chance to finish it 
 ProtagonistA had been reading it for weeks , but it seemed like every time ProtagonistA picked it up , something else came up 
 ProtagonistA was determined to finish it , though 
 Maybe tonight ProtagonistA would finally have some time to ProtagonistA 
When ProtagonistA was twelve years old , ProtagonistA cowered inside a tight , heavy cage 
 ProtagonistA was scared and alone , and ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA had gotten there 
 Now ProtagonistA was in this dark , cold place , and ProtagonistA had no idea what was going to happen to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA heard footsteps approach , and then the cage was opened 
  ProtagonistA 're going to be here for a long time 
 ProtagonistA tried to scream , but no sound would come out 
 ProtagonistA was too terrified to move as ProtagonistB reached in and grabbed ProtagonistA by the arm , dragging ProtagonistA out of the cage 
 ProtagonistA could only sit there and cry , wondering what was going to happen to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA was going to die in this place , and ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistA's family or friends again 
Three years ago ProtagonistA was the Assistant - Governor of North America 
 ProtagonistA was very proud when ProtagonistA heard that in 1779 a new and very considerable controversy had arisen between Bob and England 
 ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistA had been a subject when they had embraced the crown of England , and had established the rights of citizens , which , however , they did not abandon , till after their union , but continued to regard as alien , and uncertain 
ProtagonistA was standing there in the shade of the window of ProtagonistB's office , watching ProtagonistB's ProtagonistB's house burn down 
 Now , with ProtagonistB's house gone , ProtagonistA would never have to go back there again 
 ProtagonistA could start fresh , and finally be free 
ProtagonistA lay down in ProtagonistA's little garden and turned ProtagonistA's head to the west 
 ProtagonistA saw the sun setting behind the mountains and the sky turning red and orange 
 ProtagonistA felt the cool breeze on ProtagonistA's face and smelled the fragrance of the flowers in the garden 
 ProtagonistA felt so peaceful and happy 
 It was as if the world had been turned upside down and ProtagonistA was the only one left standing 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to feel or what to do 
 ProtagonistA just knew that ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream as ProtagonistA walked through the streets 
 ProtagonistA saw people going about their lives , completely unaware of the tragedy that had just occurred 
 ProtagonistA wanted to scream at them , to tell them that they should be grieving with ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA could n't find the words 
 ProtagonistA eventually made ProtagonistA's way to the park , where ProtagonistA sat down on a bench and just stared at the sky 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB up there , smiling down at ProtagonistA 
 And ProtagonistA would always cherish the memories of ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA sat on the deck and watched over the sea of stars that stretched out before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was always amazed at how big and bright they were 
 ProtagonistA sat there for a long time , just enjoying the view and the peace that came with it 
When ProtagonistA first met ProtagonistA's cruel and unhappy fate , ProtagonistA was as young as a pegasus 
 But , as ProtagonistA was then called , ProtagonistA was one of the bravest and most lovely princesses ever to sit upon the throne of Ages 
 Though ProtagonistA was outnumbered and outmatched , ProtagonistA never gave up , and eventually ProtagonistA won ProtagonistA's freedom 
 Though ProtagonistA was now an ordinary pony , ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistA's time as a princess , and ProtagonistA vowed to never let anything like that happen to ProtagonistA again 
ProtagonistA sat on the porch , rocking back and forth in ProtagonistA's rocking chair , looking out over the grounds of ProtagonistA's beloved family estate in the village of Valance 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the direction of the village 
 ProtagonistA got up out of ProtagonistA's chair to see what was going on 
 As ProtagonistA looked closer , ProtagonistA saw a group of people marching towards the estate 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what they wanted 
 ProtagonistA quickly ran back into the house to hide 
 ProtagonistA is petrified and does n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA is terrified and does n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA tries to run away , but they catch ProtagonistA and drag ProtagonistA out into the village square 
 ProtagonistA has no idea what they 're going to do to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA falls to the ground and the people keep throwing stones at ProtagonistA until ProtagonistA is dead 
  ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA had always thought ProtagonistB was a little bit crazy , but this was too much 
  ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head 
  ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't believe in ghosts , but ProtagonistB was clearly terrified 
 ProtagonistA decided to call their parents and tell them what was going on 
A little over a year ago , ProtagonistA made the decision to go back to ProtagonistA's kingdom 
 ProtagonistA had been away for too long and ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's home 
 ProtagonistA was happy to be home 
 ProtagonistA immediately set to work making ProtagonistA's kingdom the best it could be 
 ProtagonistA worked tirelessly day and night to make sure that ProtagonistA's subjects had everything they needed 
 ProtagonistA wanted them to be happy and safe 
ProtagonistA stood facing the sky and said ,  Okay , that 's enough of this ,  and ProtagonistA should have known better than to ask for a better answer 
 So ProtagonistA took a deep breath and stepped off the edge of the building 
ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's room and stepped out into the living room of her hooves 
 ProtagonistA had been planning to go for a walk , but ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's phone in ProtagonistA's room 
 ProtagonistA turned back around and went to ProtagonistA's room to get ProtagonistA's phone 
 When ProtagonistA turned back around , ProtagonistA saw a large , furry creature standing in the middle of the room 
 ProtagonistA was so startled that ProtagonistA dropped ProtagonistA's phone 
 After a few moments , ProtagonistA realized that the creature was a bear 
 ProtagonistA had never seen a bear in the wild before , and ProtagonistA was excited to see one up close 
 ProtagonistA slowly reached out and petted the bear 's head 
 ProtagonistA was amazed at how soft the fur was 
 ProtagonistA picked up ProtagonistA's phone and went on ProtagonistA's walk , excited to have seen a bear in the wild 
ProtagonistA had been walking for days , ever since ProtagonistA 'd seen the fire in the distance 
 Finally , ProtagonistA saw the sign for the town up ahead and ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace 
 As ProtagonistA entered the town , ProtagonistA saw that it was completely abandoned 
 ProtagonistA walked around , looking for any sign of life , but ProtagonistA found nothing 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way to the center of town and collapsed in the town square , exhausted 
 ProtagonistA pulled ProtagonistA's head from the ground and looked skyward , feeling the warmth of the sun on ProtagonistA's forehead 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let out a deep breath , feeling relieved that ProtagonistA had finally made it to safety 
ProtagonistA was a very vain man 
 ProtagonistA loved to look in the mirror and admire ProtagonistA's reflection 
 ProtagonistA was always well - dressed and had the finest of everything 
 ProtagonistA spent a lot of money on hair products and went to the best salon in town 
 One day , ProtagonistA went to get ProtagonistA's hair cut and the stylist accidentally cut off a chunk of ProtagonistA's hair 
 ProtagonistA was so upset that ProtagonistA turned ghost white 
 The stylist was very apologetic , but ProtagonistA was inconsolable 
 ProtagonistA went home and looked in the mirror 
 ProtagonistA had to do something to fix it 
 ProtagonistA went to the best wig maker in town and had a custom wig made 
 Now ProtagonistA looks in the mirror and sees the handsome man ProtagonistA once was 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the grass , watching the ponies ProtagonistA loved die 
 All ProtagonistA could think about was the ponies , and how they were suffering 
 ProtagonistA wanted to help them , but ProtagonistA did n't know how 
 ProtagonistA had always loved ponies 
 When ProtagonistA was a child , ProtagonistA would go to the farm and watch them play 
 ProtagonistA would bring them apples and carrots , and they would nuzzle ProtagonistA in return 
 Now , ProtagonistA was an old man , and the ponies were gone 
 ProtagonistA missed the sound of their hooves on the ground , and the way they would whinny when they saw ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the grass and watched the ponies ProtagonistA loved die 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never see them again , but ProtagonistA did n't want to forget them 
ProtagonistA was always an optimist 
 ProtagonistA was always looking on the bright side of things and trying to make the best of every situation 
 ProtagonistA would often say things that were designed to hurt people 's feelings or to make them angry 
 ProtagonistA stood patiently as ProtagonistB used a bucket of water to wash away the dirt and mud from ProtagonistA's hooves 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's chair , eating an apple , when ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA turned to see a Twilight Sparkle standing in ProtagonistA's living room 
 ProtagonistA had never seen a Twilight Sparkle before 
  ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA just sat there and stared at the Twilight Sparkle 
 ProtagonistA said ,  Please , stay and talk with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA and the Twilight Sparkle talked all night 
 ProtagonistA found out that the Twilight Sparkle was actually a very nice person 
 By the time the sun came up , ProtagonistA and the Twilight Sparkle were friends 
 ProtagonistA was fast asleep , ProtagonistA's little chest rising and falling with each breath 
ProtagonistA fell for the first time in ProtagonistA's life when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA fell hard for ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA thought that maybe , just maybe , ProtagonistB felt the same way about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA tried everything ProtagonistA could think of to make ProtagonistB see ProtagonistA as more than just a friend , but it was all for nothing 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA had to accept that ProtagonistB would never return ProtagonistA's feelings 
 It was a hard pill to swallow , but ProtagonistA was a stronger man for it 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could find someone who would love ProtagonistA back just as much as ProtagonistA loved them 
 ProtagonistA had been trying to escape for days , but so far , had not been successful 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA heard a noise outside the door 
 ProtagonistA got up and went to the door , listening 
 ProtagonistA heard footsteps and then a key in the lock 
 ProtagonistA quickly backed away from the door and hid behind a chair 
 ProtagonistA waited until the guard was close enough and then ProtagonistA attacked 
 ProtagonistA knocked the guard out and took his gun 
 ProtagonistA ran out of the room and down the hall 
 ProtagonistA was free ! 
ProtagonistA had been riding for days , ever since ProtagonistA had seen the first sign of the horde on the horizon 
 ProtagonistA had been riding hard , trying to outrun them , but they were relentless 
 ProtagonistA had no choice but to make a stand 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping to find some help along the way , but so far ProtagonistA had been unsuccessful 
 ProtagonistA was getting tired and ProtagonistA's horse was getting tired 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how much longer they could keep going 
 ProtagonistA stopped at the top of a hill and looked back the way ProtagonistA had come 
 ProtagonistA turned and looked at the horizon 
 ProtagonistA could see the sun starting to set and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA did n't have much time 
 ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's horse around and started riding towards the horde 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do , but ProtagonistA had to do something 
 ProtagonistA could n't just sit and wait for them to catch up to ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that there were thousands of them 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what they were , but ProtagonistA knew they were coming for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA rode right into the middle of them and stopped 
 ProtagonistA got off ProtagonistA's horse and faced them 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do something 
 ProtagonistA knew what was happening 
 ProtagonistA had seen it before 
 ProtagonistA had seen it in ProtagonistA's dreams 
ProtagonistA was a simple man 
 ProtagonistA never married and had no children , but ProtagonistA was content 
 ProtagonistA was a good man , and everyone in the village knew it 
 ProtagonistA was shocked , but ProtagonistA could n't refuse 
 ProtagonistA was a good king , and the people loved ProtagonistA 
 But one day , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was getting old 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could n't rule forever , and ProtagonistA wanted to make sure that the people would be taken care of after ProtagonistA was gone 
 So ProtagonistA decreed that , from that day forward , any mare in a free state would have the right to vote and to be elected 
 ProtagonistA wanted to make sure that everyone had a say in their own future 
ProtagonistA sat up , leaned forward to see the sky and ProtagonistA's Pony Ghost hovering just out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye 
 ProtagonistA had been riding for days , ever since ProtagonistA had seen the Pony Ghost in ProtagonistA's dreams 
 ProtagonistA was getting tired , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 ProtagonistA had to find the city and save the princess 
ProtagonistA sat down on the grass , ProtagonistA's hooves lightly tapping the dirt 
 ProtagonistA was a horse , and ProtagonistA loved the feel of the grass beneath ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had a good life , and ProtagonistA was grateful for it 
ProtagonistA dreamed that ProtagonistA was walking through a dense forest 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance 
 ProtagonistA followed the noise until ProtagonistA came to a clearing 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB not to worry , ProtagonistA would help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's way out of the Forest 
 No matter what ProtagonistA wanted to do in life , ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistA could achieve it if ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to it 
 And so , from a young age , ProtagonistA began looking up at the sky and dreaming of all the things ProtagonistA could do 
 As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA continued to look up at the sky , but ProtagonistA also began to notice all the things that were happening on the ground around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA saw the struggles of ProtagonistA's friends and neighbors and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA wanted to help them 
 So , ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's sights on becoming a doctor 
 ProtagonistA studied hard and worked even harder , and eventually ProtagonistA achieved ProtagonistA's goal 
 And , throughout ProtagonistA's career , ProtagonistA never forgot what ProtagonistB had told ProtagonistA : that the sky was the limit 
ProtagonistA stroked ProtagonistA's lower lip and watched , ProtagonistA's eyes darting across the sky , ProtagonistA's eyes trained on the alicorn 
 ProtagonistA had never seen one up close before , and ProtagonistA was mesmerized by its beauty 
 ProtagonistA watched as it flew across the sky , its wings outstretched , catching the wind 
ProtagonistA sat on the ground , ProtagonistA's eyes closed and ProtagonistA's wings flapping free 
 ProtagonistA was tired from flying all day , but ProtagonistA loved the feeling of the wind in ProtagonistA's feathers 
 ProtagonistA sat there for a while , just enjoying the peace and quiet , until ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes 
 But when ProtagonistA saw what was coming towards ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA relaxed and sat back down 
 ProtagonistA watched as the bird hopped around , looking for a spot to settle down 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes again and went back to enjoying the peace and quiet 
 It was a dark and stormy night ,  ProtagonistA began ,  and ProtagonistB was out on the streets , looking for a place to sleep 
 ProtagonistA will never forget ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistA will always be grateful to ProtagonistC for ProtagonistC's help 
ProtagonistA wakes up on the morning of the day Twilight never gives a flying fuck about what kingdom ProtagonistA's ancestors ruled 
 ProtagonistA goes to the window and opens the curtains , letting the sunlight stream in 
 ProtagonistA takes a deep breath and feels the cool air fill ProtagonistA's lungs 
 ProtagonistA looks out at the world and feels a sense of peace 
 ProtagonistA turns and walks to ProtagonistA's closet , picking out a pair of jeans and a t - shirt 
 ProtagonistA gets dressed and then goes to the kitchen , where ProtagonistA makes ProtagonistA a cup of coffee 
 ProtagonistA sits down at the table and sips ProtagonistA's coffee , letting the warmth spread through ProtagonistA's body 
 ProtagonistA thinks about the day ahead and what ProtagonistA wants to accomplish 
 ProtagonistA has a lot of work to do , but ProtagonistA does n't mind 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA can handle it 
 ProtagonistA finishes ProtagonistA's coffee and stands up , ready to start ProtagonistA's day 
 ProtagonistA knows that it will be a good one , because ProtagonistA is finally free from the past 
 ProtagonistA was in the middle of nowhere , and the voice was coming from ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA started to walk towards the voice , and as ProtagonistA got closer ProtagonistA could see that it was a woman 
 ProtagonistA started to run , and as ProtagonistA got closer ProtagonistA could see the fear in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 ProtagonistB was terrified of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was the only one who could help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA reached ProtagonistB's side and ProtagonistB collapsed into ProtagonistA's arms 
 ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistB shaking , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was in shock 
 ProtagonistA sat down with ProtagonistB and held ProtagonistB's close , and ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would never let anything hurt ProtagonistB again 
ProtagonistA was making no secret of the fact that ProtagonistA was in a state of great agitation when ProtagonistA gave vent to the fullest extent of ProtagonistA's personal irritability to the reader in the related and somewhat trite narrative of the discovery of the Hare of the Woods 
 ProtagonistA could see the fear in its eyes , and ProtagonistA knew that it was about to bolt 
 ProtagonistA was just about to take a step forward when the hare suddenly leapt up and ran away as fast as it could 
 ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA just stood there for a few moments , before ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had just witnessed the most amazing thing 
ProtagonistA was standing on the street with ProtagonistA's back to the house , looking up at the huge dark building which , between ProtagonistA's legs , was partially illuminated by the darkness of the night 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about the day when ProtagonistA would finally be able to move out of this house and into ProtagonistA's own place 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to live in a big city , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to make ProtagonistA's dream a reality 
 ProtagonistA had saved up for years , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to make the move 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to start ProtagonistA's new life , and ProtagonistA knew that this was the right decision for ProtagonistA 
Even at thirteen years of age , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was destined to one day become the dominant personality in ProtagonistA's line of work 
 ProtagonistA had always been a natural leader , and ProtagonistA's charisma was undeniable 
 ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's sights set on the top of ProtagonistA's field , and ProtagonistA was willing to do whatever it took to get there 
ProtagonistA was a young pony who was always exploring 
 One day , ProtagonistA ventured too far and fell into a hollow hill 
 But ProtagonistA did n't mind 
 ProtagonistA was just happy to be alive and to have experienced something new 
ProtagonistA was a loyal fan of the game show ,  The Final Countdown 
  ProtagonistA never missed an episode , and ProtagonistA always rooted for the contestants 
 ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and watched as the grand finale was played out on stage and then on TV 
 ProtagonistA saw the contestants sweating , the host getting nervous , and the audience on the edge of their seats 
 ProtagonistA held ProtagonistA's breath as ProtagonistA watched the scoreboard light up 
 ProtagonistA cheered along with the rest of the audience 
 It was a great finale , and ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA 'd seen it 
ProtagonistA felt so tired ProtagonistA could n't even tell the day 
 All ProtagonistA knew was that it was either night or early morning , and ProtagonistA had been walking for what felt like forever 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , ever since ProtagonistA had been kicked out of ProtagonistA's home 
 ProtagonistA had nowhere to go and no one to turn to 
 ProtagonistA was all alone in the world 
 But ProtagonistA kept walking 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving 
 ProtagonistA could n't give up 
 ProtagonistA had to find a way to make it through this 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance 
 ProtagonistA followed the sound until ProtagonistA came to a clearing 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to scare ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA needed help 
 ProtagonistA slowly approached ProtagonistB , and when ProtagonistA was close enough , ProtagonistA spoke in a soft , gentle voice 
 ProtagonistA knew how ProtagonistB felt 
 ProtagonistA had been in ProtagonistB's position before 
 It 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'll help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's way home 
 ProtagonistA may not have known where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's way home 
 ProtagonistA had been a strong man in ProtagonistA's youth , but now ProtagonistA's body was frail and ProtagonistA's mind was failing 
 ProtagonistA was the only family ProtagonistB had left , and ProtagonistB was determined to make ProtagonistA's remaining years as comfortable as possible 
 One day , ProtagonistA passed away peacefully in ProtagonistA's sleep 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day 
 First , ProtagonistA overslept and was late for work 
 As ProtagonistA finally pulled into ProtagonistA's driveway , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's neighbor 's cat perched atop ProtagonistA's car 
 ProtagonistA was in no mood for dealing with a cat , so ProtagonistA shooed it away 
 A few minutes later , ProtagonistA heard a loud screeching noise coming from ProtagonistA's backyard 
 ProtagonistA went to investigate and saw the cat attacking ProtagonistA's bird feeder 
 The bird feeder was one of ProtagonistA's favorite things , and ProtagonistA was not about to let the cat ruin it 
 ProtagonistA chased the cat away and went back inside , grumbling to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a man who loved to tell stories , and ProtagonistA was very good at it 
 ProtagonistA could make the most boring story interesting , and ProtagonistA could make the most interesting story even better 
 ProtagonistA was also a very good listener , and ProtagonistA always had time for people 
 ProtagonistA was always there for ProtagonistA's friends , and ProtagonistA was always there for ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA was a very special person , and ProtagonistA will be missed by everyone who knew ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was once a princess , but ProtagonistA gave up ProtagonistA's crown and became the Princess of the Desert 
 ProtagonistA now lives in a palace made of sand and stone in the middle of the desert 
 ProtagonistA has many servants and a harem of wives , but ProtagonistA is not happy 
 ProtagonistA misses ProtagonistA's old life and wishes ProtagonistA could be a princess again 
ProtagonistA looked around at the other ponies on the grounds and , after a few moments ' thought , decided that ProtagonistA preferred the company of the solid , rather than anything that flopped like the usual soft little things that other ponies had 
 ProtagonistA trotted over to ProtagonistB and nuzzled ProtagonistB's neck 
 From then on , ProtagonistA decided , ProtagonistA would only associate with the ponies who were like ProtagonistA : strong , dependable , and solid 
ProtagonistB was a very weird little pony , very little -- but through no fault of ProtagonistA's own did ProtagonistA ever know it 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the fields near ProtagonistA's house when ProtagonistA came across a ponytail lying in the grass 
 ProtagonistA picked it up and brushed it off , and when ProtagonistA did , the ponytail turned into ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to make of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA decided to take ProtagonistB home and care for ProtagonistB 
 One day , ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong , and ProtagonistB replied ,  ProtagonistB 'm just a little weird , that 's all 
ProtagonistA was about to go to bed when ProtagonistA saw the moon was about to rise 
 ProtagonistA decided to go for a walk and watch the last of the sun set 
 ProtagonistA could see over the sea of clouds , and ProtagonistA's golden beams were dancing in the wind 
 ProtagonistA felt so peaceful and happy watching the sunset 
ProtagonistA had a feeling something was going to be wrong as soon as ProtagonistA woke up 
 ProtagonistA could sense it in the way the light was filtering in through the window , in the way the birds were singing 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to the window , looking out at the day 
 It was going to be a beautiful day , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to have a problem 
 ProtagonistA could feel it in ProtagonistA's bones 
 ProtagonistA sighed and went to get dressed , preparing for whatever was going to come ProtagonistA's way 
ProtagonistA rolled over in a heap of snow that fell around ProtagonistA like a sea of gold in the middle of the night 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had seen the light of the fire in the distance 
 Now , ProtagonistA was so cold and so tired , ProtagonistA could barely move 
 But ProtagonistA had to keep going 
 ProtagonistA had to find help 
 ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was or how ProtagonistA had gotten there 
 Then , ProtagonistA had hit a patch of ice and lost control of the car 
 ProtagonistA must have hit ProtagonistA's head , because the next thing ProtagonistA knew , ProtagonistA was waking up in the snow 
 ProtagonistA had tried to stand up , but ProtagonistA's legs were so weak and ProtagonistA was so disoriented , ProtagonistA could barely stay on ProtagonistA's feet 
 So ProtagonistA had started crawling , using ProtagonistA's hands to pull ProtagonistA forward through the snow 
 ProtagonistA had no idea how long ProtagonistA had been crawling , but it felt like forever 
 Finally , ProtagonistA saw the light of the fire again 
 ProtagonistA forced ProtagonistA to keep going , even though every part of ProtagonistA's body was screaming at ProtagonistA to stop 
 ProtagonistA could n't stop 
 Not until ProtagonistA reached the fire 
 ProtagonistA finally made it to the fire and collapsed into it , letting the heat seep into ProtagonistA's frozen body 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was safe now 
 ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way across the room , never taking ProtagonistA's eyes off of ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA was finally close enough , ProtagonistA struck up a conversation 
 ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was interested in ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would have ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was smooth , and ProtagonistB was putty in ProtagonistA's hands 
 ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB exactly where ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistB 
 Once they were in ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's move 
 ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistB in an instant , and ProtagonistB did n't stand a chance 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's element 
 ProtagonistA loved dressing up in outrageous outfits and this one was no exception 
 ProtagonistA felt like a million bucks in ProtagonistA's yellow cardigan with a striped T - shirt underneath , a length of dress - length red - blouse and a blouse with a slit at the knee that fell just below the hips , on which ProtagonistA had a pair of high heels 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA looked good and ProtagonistA was ready to take on the world 
 ProtagonistA strutted ProtagonistA's stuff down the street , turning heads as ProtagonistA went 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could do anything in this outfit 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could take on the world 
 ProtagonistA was on top of the world 
 until ProtagonistA slipped on a banana peel and fell flat on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA lay there for a moment , feeling embarrassed and foolish 
 ProtagonistA decided to lay there for a while longer and think about what had just happened 
 ProtagonistA eventually got up , dusted ProtagonistA off and continued on ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA was a little bit more careful from then on but ProtagonistA still felt like a million bucks 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA looked good and ProtagonistA was n't going to let a little fall stop ProtagonistA from strutting ProtagonistA's stuff 
ProtagonistA was at ProtagonistA's greatest splendour when ProtagonistA was crowned king 
 ProtagonistA was the most powerful man in the world and ProtagonistA knew it 
 ProtagonistA ruled with an iron fist and ProtagonistA's kingdom flourished 
 ProtagonistA was the envy of all the other kings and they all wanted to be like ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a great king and ProtagonistA will be remembered for centuries to come 
ProtagonistA had been staring at ProtagonistA's computer screen for hours , ProtagonistA's eyes dry and strained 
 ProtagonistA was trying to focus on ProtagonistA's work , but ProtagonistA's mind kept wandering 
 ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's family and how ProtagonistA had n't seen them in a while 
 ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's friends and how ProtagonistA had n't talked to them in a while 
 ProtagonistA thought about the sky and how ProtagonistA had n't seen it in a while 
 ProtagonistA got up from ProtagonistA's desk and stretched ProtagonistA's arms 
 ProtagonistA walked to the window and looked outside 
 ProtagonistA felt a sudden urge to be outside 
 ProtagonistA grabbed ProtagonistA's jacket and headed for the door 
 ProtagonistA walked outside and took a deep breath of fresh air 
 ProtagonistA looked up at the sky and felt a sense of peace 
 ProtagonistA decided to take a walk 
 ProtagonistA walked through the park and felt the grass and the sun on ProtagonistA's skin 
 ProtagonistA felt alive 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had finally seen the sky again 
ProtagonistA sat down on the edge of the brazier and looked out over the great plain of Pamlicone 
 ProtagonistA could see the huge forest that stretched before ProtagonistA , and the many small villages that were scattered about it 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would have to cross the plain and the forest to get to ProtagonistA's destination , and ProtagonistA was not looking forward to it 
ProtagonistA was a loyal dog who always stuck by ProtagonistB's side 
 ProtagonistA barked and hung ProtagonistA's head in worry 
 ProtagonistA paced back and forth in front of the hospital , waiting for ProtagonistB to come out 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to see ProtagonistB and wagged ProtagonistA's tail in excitement 
 ProtagonistA had seen a lot of things in ProtagonistA's career , but this was something different 
 ProtagonistA worked tirelessly , but ProtagonistA just could n't crack the case 
 Then , one day , ProtagonistA got a call from ProtagonistC 
 When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistC shaking and crying 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistC for ProtagonistC's help and then ProtagonistA went to arrest ProtagonistD 
ProtagonistA was having a tough day at work 
 ProtagonistA had been staring at the same stack of paperwork for hours , and ProtagonistA's eyes were starting to hurt 
 ProtagonistA decided to take a break and closed ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA stretched out ProtagonistA's fingers and let ProtagonistA's mind wander 
 ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could just forget about work and go for a ride on ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had a hobby , one that ProtagonistA thought was amusing 
 ProtagonistA liked to sit in ProtagonistA's chair and watch the world go by 
 ProtagonistA would sit for hours , people watching and making up stories about the lives they must lead 
 ProtagonistA was content to while away the hours this way and never grew tired of it 
So , what 's the plan on the diamond market ? ProtagonistA asked as ProtagonistA gazed out at the street 
ProtagonistA had been thinking about the other day , when ProtagonistA 'd finally realized that ProtagonistA was not what ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA 'd always thought ProtagonistA was a good person , a kind person 
 But then ProtagonistA 'd done something , something that ProtagonistA knew was wrong , and ProtagonistA 'd realized that ProtagonistA was capable of darkness 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what to do with this new knowledge , but it weighed on ProtagonistA heavily 
ProtagonistA jumped off the roof of ProtagonistA's home and swam up to a small stream that ran through a small clearing of the bank 
 ProtagonistA had never been a very good swimmer , but ProtagonistA was determined to reach the other side 
 ProtagonistA struggled against the current , but eventually made it to the other side 
 ProtagonistA lay on the bank , gasping for breath , and looked up at the sky 
 ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had made it to the other side 
 ProtagonistA was happy to finally have found a family that ProtagonistA could call ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA was n't so sure 
 ProtagonistA had never been a big fan of horses , and ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA would like the idea of spending a week in a town full of them 
 ProtagonistA arrived in ProtagonistC on a warm summer day 
 ProtagonistA also noticed the horses 
 ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA enjoying ProtagonistA's time in ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA went on horseback rides , visited the local shops , and even made some new friends 
 By the end of the week , ProtagonistA was sorry to be leaving 
 But ProtagonistA was already planning to come back next year 
ProtagonistA was a horse who loved to run 
 ProtagonistA would gallop across the fields , enjoying the wind in ProtagonistA's mane and the sun on ProtagonistA's back 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was out running , ProtagonistA tripped on a root and fell 
 ProtagonistA hurt ProtagonistA's hoof and could not get up 
 ProtagonistA was grateful to ProtagonistB for helping ProtagonistA 
 From then on , whenever ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would whinny and nicker in thanks 
ProtagonistA awoke to find ProtagonistA in a strange land 
 ProtagonistA could not remember how ProtagonistA got there , or even where ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA looked around , trying to get ProtagonistA's bearings , but everything was unfamiliar to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA saw a faint path leading off into the distance and decided to follow it 
 As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA began to remember bits and pieces of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA remembered ProtagonistA's wife and children , and how much ProtagonistA loved them 
 ProtagonistA also remembered the day ProtagonistA died 
 ProtagonistA remembered feeling peace and calm as ProtagonistA passed from this life to the next 
 As the memories came back to ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA also began to feel a sense of purpose 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was meant to follow this path 
 ProtagonistA did not know where it would lead ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA had faith that it would all work out in the end 
 ProtagonistA continued walking until ProtagonistA came to a large door 
 ProtagonistA knew this was ProtagonistA's destination 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and walked through 
 ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistA's loved ones waiting for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt at peace as ProtagonistA walked towards them 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had finally come home 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked at a blank horizon 
 ProtagonistA was a dog , and a good dog at that , but ProtagonistA did n't know what to make of the blank horizon 
 ProtagonistA had been sitting there for hours , ever since ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistA behind 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure why ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB must have had a good reason 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did n't want to leave the blank horizon 
 ProtagonistA was waiting for something , ProtagonistA did n't know what , but ProtagonistA knew that whatever it was , it was coming for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistB's footing at the edge of a ruined stream , and was struggling to ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB downstream , clinging to a tree 
 ProtagonistA shouted to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB could n't hear ProtagonistA over the sound of the water 
 ProtagonistA tried to swim to ProtagonistB , but the current was too strong 
ProtagonistA thundered down the hall of the Palace , ProtagonistA's hooves pounding against the stone walls 
 ProtagonistA was on a mission 
 ProtagonistA had to find ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had to save ProtagonistB from the dragon 
 ProtagonistA had to be the hero 
 ProtagonistA turned a corner and saw the dragon , its teeth bared , its eyes glowing red 
 ProtagonistA did n't hesitate 
 ProtagonistA charged 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches , staring up at the stars 
 ProtagonistA wished that ProtagonistA could find someone to share ProtagonistA's life with 
 Someone who would understand ProtagonistA and love ProtagonistA for who ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA continued to stare at the stars , lost in thought 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistB standing there 
 ProtagonistA felt as if ProtagonistA had been struck by lightning 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was the woman ProtagonistA had been waiting for ProtagonistA's whole life 
 ProtagonistA stood up and walked over to ProtagonistB , and they embraced each other 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's wish had come true 
ProtagonistA had had a long day 
 All ProtagonistA wanted to do was relax in ProtagonistA's palace by the sea 
 ProtagonistA lit a match and put it between the curtains and the headboard , and watched as the flames spread 
 ProtagonistA just sat there and watched as ProtagonistA's palace burned to the ground 
 ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistA was now homeless and penniless 
 All ProtagonistA cared about was that ProtagonistA was finally free from all ProtagonistA's responsibilities 
 ProtagonistA could finally relax and enjoy ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA used to love going into the sunflower garden when ProtagonistA was younger 
 ProtagonistA would duck in every chance ProtagonistA got , even if ProtagonistA was just supposed to be getting the mail 
 ProtagonistA loved the smell of the sunflowers and the way they made ProtagonistA feel happy 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was older , ProtagonistA went back to the sunflower garden 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to see that the sunflowers were all gone 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what had happened and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that the sunflowers had been replaced with roses 
 ProtagonistA was sad to see the sunflowers go , but ProtagonistA was happy to see the roses 
ProtagonistA had been waiting all morning for the important piece of paperwork that was going to give ProtagonistB ProtagonistB's retroactive pardon 
 ProtagonistA was a carpenter and ProtagonistA was finishing up a job on a house that was being built 
 ProtagonistA was working on the front porch , putting the finishing touches on it 
 ProtagonistA was putting in a new railing and making sure that it was level 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB both went over to ProtagonistC 
ProtagonistA was over at the office hours , doing ProtagonistA's best hard - boiled egg - and - coconut dish 
 It was ProtagonistA's favorite dish , and ProtagonistA was determined to make it perfect 
 ProtagonistA had been working on it for hours , and it was finally ready 
 ProtagonistA placed it on the table and waited for the others to arrive 
ProtagonistA turned around on ProtagonistA's heels and ran to ProtagonistA's bed , the one ProtagonistA's father had made for ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB , to begin the long process of mourning 
 ProtagonistA owed it to ProtagonistA's father , and to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had been a horse for as long as ProtagonistA could remember 
 ProtagonistA could feel a restlessness inside of ProtagonistA , a desire for something more 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being a horse , tired of being treated like a piece of property 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be free , to live ProtagonistA's life the way ProtagonistA wanted to 
 ProtagonistA wanted to make them pay for all the years of pain and suffering they had caused ProtagonistA 
 But then ProtagonistA thought about escape 
 Maybe ProtagonistA could run away and find a place where ProtagonistA would be free to live ProtagonistA's life the way ProtagonistA wanted to 
 ProtagonistA gazed down at ProtagonistA's hooves , as if ProtagonistA could never forget to feel sorry for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being a horse , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to escape ProtagonistA's life of servitude 
ProtagonistA had never been a particularly good father 
 But one morning , when the sun was bright and the mergansie were jovial , ProtagonistA decided to see ProtagonistB for the first time in years 
 ProtagonistA drove to ProtagonistB's apartment in the city , and when ProtagonistB answered the door , ProtagonistB was surprised to see ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was amazed at how much ProtagonistB had grown and changed , and ProtagonistA was filled with pride and love for ProtagonistB 
The day before ProtagonistA went to spend the summer with ProtagonistA's friends , the very day ProtagonistA would die , ProtagonistA fell off a roof and broke ProtagonistA back 
 ProtagonistA was in a lot of pain , but ProtagonistA was also happy 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would be spending the summer with ProtagonistA's friends and that ProtagonistA would die doing something ProtagonistA loved 
 ProtagonistA was about to kill the boys , but Applejack stopped ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had called to say that ProtagonistA was pregnant , and no one ever said anything like that anymore 
 It was a shock to everyone , especially since ProtagonistA was a man 
 But ProtagonistA was happy and excited about the baby , and that was all that mattered 
 ProtagonistA was rich , handsome , and had a great job 
 But ProtagonistA was bored 
 ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA could ever want , but ProtagonistA was missing one thing : a challenge 
 So , ProtagonistA decided to go on a quest 
 ProtagonistA would travel the world , seeking out adventure and danger 
 And ProtagonistA would document it all on ProtagonistA's blog 
 ProtagonistA climbed mountains , swam with sharks , and even went to space 
 And ProtagonistA loved every minute of it 
 But eventually , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA could n't keep doing this forever 
 ProtagonistA had to settle down and live a normal life 
 So , ProtagonistA returned home and started a family 
 And ProtagonistA was happy 
ProtagonistA came into the kitchen to find ProtagonistA's father reading a journal 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's father had been writing in it every day since ProtagonistA's mother had died 
 ProtagonistA sat down at the table and watched ProtagonistA's father for a moment 
 ProtagonistA was always hungry and ProtagonistA was always getting into trouble 
 When ProtagonistA was ten , ProtagonistA ran away from home 
 ProtagonistA hitchhiked to the nearest city and started living on the streets 
 ProtagonistA did whatever ProtagonistA could to survive 
 ProtagonistA begged for food , ProtagonistA stole , and ProtagonistA did whatever ProtagonistA had to do to stay alive 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was finally starting to make something of ProtagonistA's life 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistD 
 ProtagonistA was finally starting to turn ProtagonistA's life around 
 ProtagonistA was happy and ProtagonistA had a future 
 ProtagonistA was always afraid that ProtagonistA would end up back on the streets 
 ProtagonistA was always afraid that ProtagonistA would end up like ProtagonistC 
 But ProtagonistA was determined to make something of ProtagonistA's life 
 And ProtagonistA did 
ProtagonistA was just finishing up the last of the cupcakes and had nearly finished ProtagonistA's breakfast when ProtagonistA heard the door open 
 ProtagonistA knew it was ProtagonistB coming home from ProtagonistB's night shift at the hospital 
 ProtagonistA got up to greet ProtagonistB with a hug and a kiss 
ProtagonistA had been trying to find ProtagonistA's way out of the living room for hours 
 ProtagonistA had been looking for the door for what felt like days , but ProtagonistA could n't find it 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours and ProtagonistA's feet were sore 
 ProtagonistA sat down to rest for a minute and looked around the room 
 ProtagonistA saw the door across the room and got up to walk to it 
 ProtagonistA was so tired , ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA might not make it 
 ProtagonistA took a few steps and then ProtagonistA saw something that made ProtagonistA stop 
 ProtagonistA walked to the door and looked through the hole 
 ProtagonistA saw the living room and the door to the outside 
 ProtagonistA was so happy , ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's way out 
 ProtagonistA had never remarried , and had instead devoted ProtagonistA to raising ProtagonistB 
 Now that ProtagonistB was married , ProtagonistA felt somewhat lost 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could not continue to live alone , and so ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA would go back to the family home and marry a woman 
The day the earth froze , ProtagonistA used the last of ProtagonistA's magic power to reveal to ProtagonistB the greatest secret of all 
 ProtagonistA 'm sorry ProtagonistA could n't tell ProtagonistB sooner , but ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB 'll be just fine without ProtagonistA 
  With that , ProtagonistA vanished into thin air , leaving ProtagonistB to wonder what had just happened 
  ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB to get it for ProtagonistA 
 The one for the perfect crime ,  ProtagonistA replied 
  ProtagonistA need to get ProtagonistA's hands on it so ProtagonistA can finally get away with murder 
 You have to ,  ProtagonistA insisted 
ProtagonistA looked around and noticed that ProtagonistA had disappeared 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how it had happened , but ProtagonistA was now in a strange place 
 ProtagonistA started to walk , hoping to find a way out 
 After a while , ProtagonistA came to a huge door 
 ProtagonistA tried to open it , but it was locked 
 ProtagonistA kept walking and came to another door 
 ProtagonistA kept walking and came to a third door 
 ProtagonistA opened it and walked through 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden 
 ProtagonistA felt at peace in this place 
ProtagonistA had been walking for days 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping to find a town or at least a farmhouse , but so far ProtagonistA had seen nothing but empty plains 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up and sit down for a rest when ProtagonistA saw something on the horizon 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA's eyes ! There , in the distance , was a town ! ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace and soon ProtagonistA was standing at the edge of the town 
 ProtagonistA walked through the streets , calling out for any sign of life , but there was none 
 ProtagonistA sat down on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked at the blank horizon 
 It was then that ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA was n't alone 
ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistA's eyes peeled for anything out of the ordinary , but ProtagonistA was doing ProtagonistA best to ignore the odd look the look of interest was giving ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA let ProtagonistA get too caught up in what was going on , ProtagonistA would never be able to focus on ProtagonistA's work 
 ProtagonistA tried to shake it off , but it was no use 
 Finally , ProtagonistA gave up and turned to ProtagonistB 
 Can ProtagonistA help ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked , a little bit of annoyance in ProtagonistA's voice 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart soften a little 
  Oh , ProtagonistA see 
 No matter what life threw at ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA would keep ProtagonistA's eyes peeled for anything out of the ordinary and stay focused on what was important 
ProtagonistA trotted across the grass to ProtagonistA's new cottage 
 ProtagonistA had only moved in a few weeks ago , but ProtagonistA loved it already 
 ProtagonistA trotted down the steps and to the door , stopping to sniff at a flower that was blooming by the door 
 ProtagonistA nosed the door open and went inside , immediately going to ProtagonistA's favourite spot by the window 
 ProtagonistA lay down and watched the birds as they flew by , content in ProtagonistA's new home 
ProtagonistA had always been an early riser , so it was no surprise to find ProtagonistA up and about at the crack of dawn 
 ProtagonistA looked around the vast space with the air of a man who had been transported back to England 
 ProtagonistA turned to ProtagonistB and said ,  ProtagonistA 'm looking for a book on etiquette 
 ProtagonistA was so engrossed in the books that ProtagonistA did n't notice when the store started to fill up with customers 
 As the day went on , ProtagonistA became more and more comfortable in the bookstore 
 ProtagonistA started chatting with the customers and helping them find the books they were looking for 
 By the end of the day , ProtagonistA had made quite a few friends 
 ProtagonistA had found what ProtagonistA was looking for , not in a book , but in the people ProtagonistA had met 
ProtagonistA had been going through a bad patch of writing for a few weeks now , but if the last few months had gone by ProtagonistA had not long since come to the realisation that the final word was not always the most important 
 ProtagonistA had been through some tough times recently , and ProtagonistA's writing had suffered as a result 
 But ProtagonistA was determined to get back on track , and ProtagonistA knew that the only way to do that was to keep writing 
 So ProtagonistA sat down at ProtagonistA's desk and started to write 
 ProtagonistA wrote and wrote , and the words flowed from ProtagonistA's pen 
 ProtagonistA did n't worry about whether they were perfect or not , ProtagonistA just kept writing 
 And , as ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA started to feel better 
 Slowly but surely , ProtagonistA was starting to heal 
ProtagonistA stood up and trotted through the gardens , running up the side of a hill and across the grass , until ProtagonistA reached the top of a bluff above the water 's surface 
 At the edge of the bluff , ProtagonistA stopped and looked down at the water below 
 ProtagonistA loved the smell of the ocean , and ProtagonistA could see the waves crashing against the shore in the distance 
 ProtagonistA was about to turn and go back down the hill when ProtagonistA heard a noise behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw a big , black bear coming towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was scared , and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should run away , but ProtagonistA was frozen in place 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and waited for the bear to attack ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what had happened , but ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA was still alive 
 ProtagonistA turned and ran back down the hill as fast as ProtagonistA could 
ProtagonistA had been out all day , running errands and doing errands 
 ProtagonistA was tired and cold and just wanted to go home , to ProtagonistA's warm and cozy house 
 But when ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA's house was dark and cold 
 ProtagonistA was so tired and cold that ProtagonistA just wanted to curl up in a ball and go to sleep 
 But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to find a way to get warm and to light ProtagonistA's house 
 ProtagonistA went to the castle and asked for help 
 ProtagonistA was so grateful 
 ProtagonistA went home and immediately started a fire in the fireplace and lit all the candles 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to be warm and to have light 
 ProtagonistA curled up in ProtagonistA's blanket and went to sleep , feeling grateful for the king and queen 's help 
ProtagonistA stood on ProtagonistA's rock and stared into the water 
 ProtagonistA had been coming to this spot for years , ever since ProtagonistA was a child 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a writer , but it had never happened 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to travel , but ProtagonistA had never been able to afford it 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to be happy , but ProtagonistA had never been able to find true happiness 
 As ProtagonistA stared into the water , ProtagonistA made a decision 
 ProtagonistA was going to change ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was going to do the things ProtagonistA had always wanted to do 
 ProtagonistA was going to be the person ProtagonistA had always wanted to be 
ProtagonistA was having a hard time deciding whether to take ProtagonistA's first trip home or not 
 ProtagonistA had been away at college for a year , and while ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's independence , ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's family and friends back home 
 In the end , ProtagonistA decided to take the trip home 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to see everyone again and to catch up on all the news 
 ProtagonistA had a great time , and it was nice to be home again 
ProtagonistA is my best friend 
 And ProtagonistA really likes me , but that does n't bother ProtagonistA much anymore 
 ProtagonistA was the first to see me , and ProtagonistA welcomed me into the world with a warm hug 
 You're going to be the best hooves on the staff of Everfree ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA has always been there for me , even when I made mistakes 
 ProtagonistA always forgives me , and ProtagonistA always makes me laugh 
 That 's why ProtagonistA 's my best friend 
ProtagonistA had been married to Applejack for several weeks when ProtagonistA heard that Twilight was expecting ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was overjoyed for ProtagonistA's friends and could n't wait to meet ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistB was born , ProtagonistA was one of the first to visit and held ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's arms , tears of joy streaming down ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to have another little one in the family and could n't wait to watch ProtagonistB grow up 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day 
 First , ProtagonistA's alarm clock did n't go off , so ProtagonistA was late for work 
 And to top it all off , ProtagonistA accidentally spilled coffee all over ProtagonistA's shirt 
 ProtagonistA was so frazzled and upset that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 So ProtagonistA just sat down on the ground , on top of ProtagonistA's hooves , with ProtagonistA's tail turned to one side and ProtagonistA's eyes closed 
 ProtagonistA needed a moment to calm down and gather ProtagonistA's thoughts 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to be left alone , but it seemed like the whole world was against ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was out on a walk with ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA suddenly had the urge to play a prank on ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA laughed to ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB go , before continuing on ProtagonistA's walk 
ProtagonistA was a pegasus who loved to fly 
 ProtagonistA loved the feeling of the wind in ProtagonistA's mane and the sun on ProtagonistA's back 
 But one day , when ProtagonistA was flying over the sea , ProtagonistA saw something strange 
 There was a large object in the water and it was moving ! ProtagonistA flew closer to get a better look and saw that it was a boat 
 ProtagonistA had never seen a boat before and was curious about it 
 ProtagonistA flew down to the water and landed on the boat 
 ProtagonistA looked around and saw that there were people on the boat 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , so ProtagonistA just sat on ProtagonistA's saddle and watched the people 
ProtagonistA looked up from the book ProtagonistA was reading , and the tear - streaked blue of ProtagonistA's eyes seemed to say , ProtagonistA think we both know what we 're in for 
 ProtagonistA worked long hours and when ProtagonistA was home , ProtagonistA was always either reading or watching television 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA know ProtagonistA 've been a terrible husband 
 ProtagonistA do n't know how to fix this 
 ProtagonistA had been running for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had seen the fire in the distance 
 Now , as ProtagonistA stood on the bank of the river , ProtagonistA could see the flames still burning in the distance 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to cross the river to get to safety , but ProtagonistA was so tired 
 ProtagonistA had been running for days , ever since the fire had started 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how much longer ProtagonistA could keep going 
 ProtagonistA stood there for a moment , trying to summon the energy to cross the river 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving , but ProtagonistA was so tired 
 Finally , ProtagonistA took a deep breath and stepped into the water 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how long it took ProtagonistA to cross the river , but eventually ProtagonistA made it to the other side 
 ProtagonistA climbed up on the bank and collapsed 
 ProtagonistA lay there , trying to catch ProtagonistA's breath , as ProtagonistA watched the flames in the distance 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep moving , but ProtagonistA was so tired 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and drifted off to sleep 
The first time we met ProtagonistA , in a dream , ProtagonistA had gone there alone 
 In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA in a strange place 
 When ProtagonistA had awoken , ProtagonistA had been alone in the dark house 
 ProtagonistA had no idea what the dream had meant , but ProtagonistA had been left with a feeling of unease 
ProtagonistA watched the sunset from the window of ProtagonistA's room at the end of the house , ProtagonistA's fingers pressing the slender small mirror against the tabletop in the middle of the room 
 ProtagonistA loved the way the colors changed and the way the light shone through the window 
 ProtagonistA sat in ProtagonistA's chair and watched the sunset until it was gone , and then ProtagonistA went to bed 
ProtagonistA had never imagined that ProtagonistA would be one of the subject matter of such a search , but even now it seemed that ProtagonistA was holding onto something which perhaps ProtagonistA was n't entirely comfortable with 
 Everywhere ProtagonistA went , ProtagonistA felt as though eyes were upon ProtagonistA , following ProtagonistA's every move 
 ProtagonistA had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time 
 ProtagonistA had been walking home from work one evening when ProtagonistA had seen a group of men loitering in an alleyway 
 Something about their demeanour had made ProtagonistA uneasy , so ProtagonistA had decided to take a different route home 
 ProtagonistA had hesitated for a moment , not knowing whether to intervene or not 
 But then ProtagonistA had seen one of the men pull out a knife , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do something 
 ProtagonistA had run into the alleyway and tackled the man with the knife to the ground 
 But ProtagonistA did n't feel like a hero 
 ProtagonistA just felt like a normal guy who had done what anyone else would have done in that situation 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to go back to living a normal , anonymous life 
ProtagonistA was so nervous , ProtagonistA could barely stand still 
 ProtagonistA had never been away from home before , and the big city was so scary 
 And with that , ProtagonistA found the courage to step out into the unknown 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's room , looking at the stars and thinking about ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was a tall , thin man who was born in England but had lived in America for most of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about how little ProtagonistA had left to ProtagonistA's name and how ProtagonistA's daughter , Dora , would be left with even less 
 ProtagonistA was bored with this thought and decided to go to bed 
One morning ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's doubts again 
 ProtagonistA was walking to work , and ProtagonistA just could n't shake the feeling that something was off 
 ProtagonistA could n't put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but ProtagonistA just had this feeling like something bad was going to happen 
 ProtagonistA tried to push it out of ProtagonistA's mind , but it was just nagging at ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA okay ? ProtagonistA looked a million miles away 
  ProtagonistA snapped out of it and forced a smile 
  ProtagonistA nodded and went to ProtagonistA's desk 
 ProtagonistA tried to focus on ProtagonistA's work , but ProtagonistA's mind was still racing 
  ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA okay ? ProtagonistA looked a million miles away 
  ProtagonistA snapped out of it and forced a smile 
  ProtagonistA nodded and went to ProtagonistA's desk 
 ProtagonistA tried to focus on ProtagonistA's work , but ProtagonistA's mind was still racing 
ProtagonistA was back at the bank , shuffling ProtagonistA's feet as ProtagonistA waited with bated breath for the check to come in 
 ProtagonistA had been waiting for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA had been laid off from ProtagonistA's job 
 The check was ProtagonistA's last hope ; if it did n't come in , ProtagonistA would be homeless 
 ProtagonistA was desperate 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB and begged for a loan , but ProtagonistB refused 
 ProtagonistA had no collateral and no way to prove ProtagonistA could repay the loan 
 ProtagonistA was out of options 
 ProtagonistA went home and packed ProtagonistA's belongings into a suitcase 
 ProtagonistA would have to find a way to make the check stretch until ProtagonistA could find another job 
ProtagonistA looked around , minding ProtagonistA's own business , when ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA face to face with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA dodged to the side at the last second , leaving ProtagonistB to slam into a tree 
 ProtagonistA ran up to ProtagonistB and punched ProtagonistB in the face as hard as ProtagonistA could 
ProtagonistA lifted ProtagonistA's head , and peered out over the horizon 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , and was getting tired 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping to find a town soon , but so far ProtagonistA had seen nothing but desert 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up and sit down for a rest , when ProtagonistA saw something in the distance 
 ProtagonistA started walking towards it , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was a town 
 ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , and soon ProtagonistA was in the town 
 ProtagonistA went to the first building ProtagonistA saw , and knocked on the door 
ProtagonistA has been slowly moping ProtagonistA's hooves through the blizzard of paperwork that is the letter from the Apple family 
 ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA wo n't be able to finish it tonight , but ProtagonistA ca n't just leave it unfinished 
 ProtagonistA 'll have to come back tomorrow and try again 
ProtagonistA sat by ProtagonistA's friends , watching them , and looking around ProtagonistA saw that they were all having a great time 
 ProtagonistA felt a little left out , but ProtagonistA did n't want to ruin their fun 
 ProtagonistA decided to just enjoy watching them and listening to their laughter 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's bedroom , writing a letter to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was telling ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's day and how ProtagonistA had made a new friend 
 ProtagonistA was really happy and ProtagonistA wanted to share it with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was also telling ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's plans for the future and how ProtagonistA wanted to make a difference in the world 
ProtagonistA thrashed about on all fours , helping ProtagonistA's hooves through the dusty soil like a frightened child 
 ProtagonistA had never felt so scared in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was sure that any moment now , the ground would open up and swallow ProtagonistA whole 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how much longer ProtagonistA could keep going 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt something touch ProtagonistA's back and ProtagonistA jumped 
 ProtagonistA spun around to see a large , dark shape looming over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA let out a terrified whinny and tried to run , but the ground was too slippery and ProtagonistA could n't get traction 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it when ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was being carried by a giant eagle 
 ProtagonistA felt a wave of relief wash over ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA nuzzled the eagle 's neck in gratitude 
 ProtagonistA had never been so thankful for the help of a stranger 
ProtagonistA had been meaning to write to ProtagonistB for a long time , but ProtagonistA was beginning to get tired of waiting 
 Finally , ProtagonistA decided to take matters into ProtagonistA's own hands and write ProtagonistB a letter 
 In it , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB how ProtagonistA felt about ProtagonistB and how much ProtagonistA cared for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA also told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was getting tired of waiting for ProtagonistB to make a move and that ProtagonistA was going to take action 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB to meet ProtagonistA at the park the following day so that they could talk 
 The next day , ProtagonistA waited at the park for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB never showed up 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's advice and started dating again 
 ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC and they hit it off immediately 
 I was shocked to see ProtagonistA there , but even more shocked to see the state ProtagonistA was in 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA had nowhere else to go 
 ProtagonistA 's getting a job and making new friends 
ProtagonistA was walking home from work when ProtagonistA noticed the moon 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but stare at it 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was being pulled into the light 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt something warm and soft on ProtagonistA's cheek 
 ProtagonistA realized it was the light from the moon 
 ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA had been able to see the light from the moon 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked down at a firm blank horizon 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and ProtagonistA's stomach was empty 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping to find a town or a farm , but so far ProtagonistA had seen nothing but empty fields 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up and lie down to die when ProtagonistA saw a faint light in the distance 
 ProtagonistA got up and started walking towards it , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was a lamp in a window 
 ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , and soon ProtagonistA was at the door of the farmhouse 
 ProtagonistA knocked , and ProtagonistB answered 
 ProtagonistA went to bed that night feeling hopeful for the first time in a long time 
ProtagonistA had just gotten off work when ProtagonistA was kidnapped by a shadowy figure 
 ProtagonistA was terrified of what was going to happen to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA tried to scream for help but no one could hear ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA eventually died of dehydration 
 ProtagonistA was beginning to think that maybe the stories ProtagonistA 'd heard about the creature were just that , stories 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistA saw the beast kill a deer 
ProtagonistA had been sneaking into the Ponyville library for weeks now 
 ProtagonistA was always careful to do it when the library was crowded , so that no one would notice ProtagonistA 
 I'm sorry , ProtagonistA just really wanted to read this book ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA 're going to have to leave now 
 ProtagonistA hung ProtagonistA's head in shame and walked out of the library 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had been caught this time , but ProtagonistA was determined to find a way to get ProtagonistA's hands on that book 
ProtagonistA hope we 'll be okay 
 ProtagonistA nodded , but said nothing 
 ProtagonistA was tired , and ProtagonistA's hooves hurt 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to find a place to rest , and maybe some food 
 ProtagonistA listened , but ProtagonistA could n't hear anything 
  ProtagonistA do n't hear anything ,  ProtagonistA said 
  There it is again!This time , ProtagonistA could hear it too 
 But ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were faster 
ProtagonistA was a horse who loved to shake ProtagonistA's head and shake ProtagonistA's hoof 
 ProtagonistA would do it whenever ProtagonistA felt like it , and it always made ProtagonistA feel better 
 One day , ProtagonistA was feeling particularly down and decided to shake ProtagonistA's head and hoof more than usual 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt something strange happen 
 ProtagonistA's head and hoof began to shake uncontrollably ! ProtagonistA was terrified and did n't know what was happening to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA tried to stop shaking , but it was no use 
 ProtagonistA lay there shaking and trembling until ProtagonistA finally died 
 ProtagonistA was always able to imagine things vividly and in great detail 
 ProtagonistA could recall every detail of a scene , no matter how minor 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA knew everything 
 ProtagonistA was always the one with the answers in class , and ProtagonistA always seemed to be one step ahead of everyone else 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what it was like to be in love , or to be heartbroken 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what it was like to lose someone close to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what it was like to feel truly happy , or truly sad 
 ProtagonistA did n't know anything about the world outside of ProtagonistA's small town 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what it was like to be truly alive 
 But ProtagonistA was about to find out 
ProtagonistA had been working hard all day , and ProtagonistA was ready to go home 
 ProtagonistA's master was in command of the galley , and ProtagonistA was ready to go home 
ProtagonistA sat down on the edge of the bank , crossed ProtagonistA's legs , and stared out into the sea 
 ProtagonistA felt at peace 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately and ProtagonistA needed this moment to just relax and clear ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and took a deep breath 
ProtagonistA had been sitting on ProtagonistA's rock for hours , blinking ProtagonistA's eyes and wondering how to get back to reality 
 ProtagonistA had been in a deep sleep when ProtagonistA was suddenly transported to this strange place 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA got here or how to get back 
 ProtagonistA looked around and saw nothing but rocks and sand 
 ProtagonistA got up and started walking , hoping to find someone who could help ProtagonistA 
 After walking for what seemed like hours , ProtagonistA came to a small oasis 
 ProtagonistA was so thirsty and exhausted , ProtagonistA fell to ProtagonistA's knees and started to drink 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt someone shaking ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw ProtagonistA's wife standing over ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA fell asleep in the sun again 
 ProtagonistA 're going to get sunburned 
 ProtagonistA blinked ProtagonistA's eyes and realized ProtagonistA was back in reality 
 ProtagonistA had been dreaming the whole time 
ProtagonistA was quietly trying to get to ProtagonistA's feet when ProtagonistA heard a sharp screech 
 ProtagonistA froze in place , not knowing what to do 
 ProtagonistA slowly turned ProtagonistA's head to see a large bird perched on a nearby tree 
ProtagonistA stood at the edge of the rocky pinnacle , ProtagonistA's hooves glinting in the morning sunlight 
 ProtagonistA looked out over the vast landscape before ProtagonistA and felt a sense of peace wash over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA breathed in the fresh air and felt ProtagonistA's muscles relax 
ProtagonistA was a horse whisperer 
 ProtagonistA could communicate with horses better than anyone else 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's life and how ProtagonistA 'd been kicked out of the herd by the alpha male 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about how ProtagonistA 'd been wandering the plains alone for months , searching for a new herd to join 
 ProtagonistA was always the first to wake up in the morning and would spend ProtagonistA's time exploring the grounds or reading in the library 
 Tonight , ProtagonistA had decided to have dinner in ProtagonistA's own house on the fort grounds 
 ProtagonistA sat down at the large , white - walled low table and began to eat ProtagonistA's dinner 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the other room 
 ProtagonistA got up to investigate and found ProtagonistB trying to break into ProtagonistA's house 
 ProtagonistA ran back to the dining room and grabbed a knife from the table 
 ProtagonistA ran back to ProtagonistB and stabbed ProtagonistB in the stomach 
 ProtagonistA finished ProtagonistA's dinner , but ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that something was watching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a peaceful man , and ProtagonistA found solace in the quiet of the forest 
 It was a place that ProtagonistA had always felt connected to , ever since ProtagonistA was a young boy 
 ProtagonistA had many fond memories of exploring the woods with ProtagonistA's friends , and ProtagonistA still loved to take a walk through them whenever ProtagonistA had the chance 
 ProtagonistA could feel a presence in the forest that ProtagonistA had never felt before 
 Slowly , ProtagonistA stood up and began to follow the feeling , not knowing what ProtagonistA would find 
 And there , in the clearing , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to speak to ProtagonistB 
 Slowly , ProtagonistA walked forward , and when ProtagonistA was just a few feet away from ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA cleared ProtagonistA's throat to get ProtagonistB's attention 
 When ProtagonistB turned around , ProtagonistA was shocked to see that ProtagonistB had the most beautiful eyes ProtagonistA had ever seen 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could get lost in them forever 
 And in that moment , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had found the love of ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA was sitting at the kitchen table , working on ProtagonistA's homework 
ProtagonistA took a deep breath , then ProtagonistA's horn : the thrall of ambition 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a musician , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to make ProtagonistA's dream come true 
 ProtagonistA had been practicing for months , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was ready 
 ProtagonistA was going to audition for the school band 
 ProtagonistA walked into the auditorium , where the audition was being held , and ProtagonistA saw all of the other kids who were trying out 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and walked up to the stage 
 ProtagonistA played ProtagonistA's piece flawlessly , and when ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had gotten the part 
 ProtagonistA was so excited , and ProtagonistA could n't wait to tell ProtagonistA's parents 
 ProtagonistA had always loved music , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to be able to share ProtagonistA's passion with the world 
The day I first met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was four and a half years old 
 ProtagonistA was a chubby little boy with curly brown hair and big blue eyes 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a pair of overalls and a red t - shirt with a picture of a dinosaur on it 
 ProtagonistA was sitting in the waiting room at the doctor 's office , swinging ProtagonistA's feet back and forth 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be a paleontologist and I wanted to be a veterinarian 
 I hope ProtagonistA 's doing well and that ProtagonistA 's still interested in dinosaurs 
ProtagonistA was brushing ProtagonistB's hair as the sun rose over the sky 
 ProtagonistA had been up since before dawn , and ProtagonistA was feeling the effects of a long day 
 ProtagonistA had been working on the farm since ProtagonistA was a young boy , and ProtagonistA loved every minute of it 
 ProtagonistA had raised ProtagonistB from a foal , and ProtagonistB was like a member of the family 
 ProtagonistA finished brushing ProtagonistB's coat and gave ProtagonistB a pat on the neck 
  There ProtagonistB go , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA had a lot of work to do today , but ProtagonistA would n't trade it for anything in the world 
ProtagonistA had been a force in the history of the land for many years 
 ProtagonistA had passed away a few years before , but ProtagonistB had not forgotten ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had always been a patient man 
 ProtagonistA would sit for hours waiting for the perfect moment to strike 
 ProtagonistA would just sit there patiently , waiting 
 ProtagonistA had always told ProtagonistB that patience was key when fishing 
 ProtagonistA had always said that the best time to fish was at night , under the light of the moon 
 ProtagonistA came over , and was so proud of ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA stood on ProtagonistA's hind legs , took a long breath , and surveyed the room 
 ProtagonistA had always been a curious cat , and ProtagonistA was determined to find out what was beyond the four walls of ProtagonistA's home 
 ProtagonistA had heard the other animals in the neighborhood talking , and they all seemed to think that there was some great big world out there 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what to believe , but ProtagonistA was determined to find out for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had seen the humans leave the house each day , and ProtagonistA knew that they must go somewhere 
 ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA would follow them the next time they left and see where they went 
 The next day , ProtagonistA waited by the door , and when the humans left , ProtagonistA followed them 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to find that they went to a place called  work 
  ProtagonistA was n't sure what that was , but ProtagonistA was determined to find out 
 ProtagonistA followed the humans to work every day for a week , and ProtagonistA began to piece together what it was that they did 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA got brave enough to venture out into the world on ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA found that there was so much to see and do , and ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had followed the humans out of ProtagonistA's house 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never be content to stay inside four walls again 
ProtagonistA gave a hoof and ProtagonistA's ears a slight twitching 
 ProtagonistA had been waiting for this moment for years 
 ProtagonistA was a horse , and ProtagonistA was about to embark on the greatest adventure of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was excited , but ProtagonistA was also a little bit nervous 
 But ProtagonistA was up for the challenge 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have ProtagonistB by ProtagonistA's side , and ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to help ProtagonistB navigate the difficult terrain 
 ProtagonistA was determined to make it to the end of the journey 
ProtagonistA had always known that ProtagonistA had a lot of talent 
 ProtagonistA had always been good at everything ProtagonistA tried 
 But ProtagonistA never really pursued any of ProtagonistA's talents because ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life the way it was 
 ProtagonistA had a good job , a nice house , and a loving family 
 But one day , ProtagonistA decided to take a risk and pursue ProtagonistA's talent for writing 
 ProtagonistA had always enjoyed writing stories , and ProtagonistA was pretty good at it 
 So ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's job , sold ProtagonistA's house , and moved to Hollywood to become a writer 
 ProtagonistA won an Academy Award for it , and ProtagonistA was able to provide a comfortable life for ProtagonistA's family 
ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA pranced through the air , bouncing on ProtagonistA's wings , ProtagonistA's hooves floating in the swirling air 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could fly forever 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a loud noise 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to get caught in the storm , so ProtagonistA started to fly towards the nearest cave 
 ProtagonistA was getting scared 
 ProtagonistA tried to fly faster , but it was no use 
 ProtagonistA landed with a thud 
 The cave was dark and damp , and ProtagonistA was very scared 
 ProtagonistA wanted to go home 
 But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't fly in the storm 
 ProtagonistA would have to wait it out 
 ProtagonistA curled up in a corner of the cave and tried to go to sleep 
 ProtagonistA was glad when the storm finally died down and ProtagonistA could fly home 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's saddle and watched the sunset 
 ProtagonistA was a cowboy and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA loved the smell of the saddle and the feel of the horse beneath ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA loved the sound of the wind in the trees and the sound of the cattle in the distance 
 ProtagonistA loved the way the sun felt on ProtagonistA's face and the way the stars shone in the night sky 
 ProtagonistA was happy and content 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about the day 's events and how ProtagonistA could have handled them better 
 ProtagonistA was also thinking about the future and what ProtagonistA wanted to do with ProtagonistA's life 
 When ProtagonistA arrived at ProtagonistA's cabin , ProtagonistA dismounted and went inside 
 ProtagonistA sat down in ProtagonistA's chair and sighed 
 ProtagonistA was just about to drift off to sleep when ProtagonistA heard a noise outside 
 ProtagonistA got up and went to the window to see what it was 
 ProtagonistA saw a figure moving around in the shadows 
 ProtagonistA was about to go outside and investigate when ProtagonistA heard a voice in ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA listened to it and decided to wait and see what the figure was up to 
 ProtagonistA watched as it came closer to the cabin 
 ProtagonistA could see that it was a person 
 ProtagonistA was about to go outside and confront the person when they suddenly dropped what they were carrying and ran away 
 ProtagonistA was curious about what they had dropped , so ProtagonistA went outside to investigate 
 ProtagonistA found a bag of money at ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistA picked it up and looked inside 
 ProtagonistA saw that there were a lot of bills inside 
 ProtagonistA was about to take it back inside when ProtagonistA heard the voice in ProtagonistA's head again 
 ProtagonistA thought about it for a moment and then decided to listen to the voice 
 ProtagonistA put the money in ProtagonistA's pocket and went back inside 
 ProtagonistA sat down and thought about what ProtagonistA had just done 
 ProtagonistA knew that it was the right thing to do and that ProtagonistA would never forget it 
ProtagonistA sat and watched the rain , knowing ProtagonistA's friends would be there to help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately and was feeling down 
 ProtagonistA tried to talk to ProtagonistB about it , but ProtagonistB would just brush ProtagonistA off 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA stopped trying 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would never be the same 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's rock and stared into the water 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner , but ProtagonistA had never felt so alone as ProtagonistA did now 
 ProtagonistA had always been content to just sit and stare at the water , but now ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA needed to do something more 
 ProtagonistA needed to find a way to connect with other people 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure how to do that , but ProtagonistA was determined to find a way 
ProtagonistA was about to take ProtagonistA's maiden - head to court 
 ProtagonistA was a young man , and this was ProtagonistA's first time in court 
 ProtagonistA was nervous , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to do this 
 ProtagonistA had to stand up for ProtagonistA and for what ProtagonistA believed in 
 ProtagonistA was going to take on the establishment , and ProtagonistA was going to win 
 ProtagonistA had no money to buy food , so ProtagonistA would often go to the local grocery store and beg for food 
 One day , ProtagonistA went to the grocery store and saw a sign that said  Help Wanted 
  ProtagonistA went inside and asked the manager if ProtagonistA could have the job 
ProtagonistA sat on the bank , hunting for ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA had been looking for them for hours , but ProtagonistA could n't find them anywhere 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw a group of them sitting on a log in the distance 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to see them that ProtagonistA ran over and hugged them all 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day 
 So when ProtagonistA's co - worker said something stupid , ProtagonistA lost it 
 ProtagonistA threw down ProtagonistA's chair and leaned forward in the air , ready to give the guy a piece of his mind 
 But before ProtagonistA could say anything , ProtagonistA felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's chest and collapsed to the floor 
ProtagonistA had been walking through the woods for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting tired 
 ProtagonistA had been following a trail , but it seemed to have disappeared 
 ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA was going in circles 
 ProtagonistA sat down to rest on a log , and ProtagonistA looked up at the moon 
 ProtagonistA was sure the moon was getting bigger and brighter 
 ProtagonistA got up and started to walk again , and ProtagonistA came to a clearing 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was dreaming , but ProtagonistA did n't want to wake up 
ProtagonistA woke up groggy and disoriented 
 ProtagonistA looked around ProtagonistA's messy bedroom , trying to remember what ProtagonistA had been doing all morning 
 ProtagonistA could n't recall going to bed the night before , or what ProtagonistA had done the day before that 
 ProtagonistA felt a wave of panic wash over ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA could n't remember anything from the past week 
 ProtagonistA tried to stand up , but ProtagonistA's legs felt like jelly and ProtagonistA collapsed back onto the bed 
ProtagonistA was a Fox - man of the valley , and in those days , the Fox - men were at war with the evil forces of the world 
 ProtagonistA was a brave and noble warrior , and ProtagonistA would do whatever it took to protect ProtagonistA's people 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was out on patrol , ProtagonistA spotted a group of enemy soldiers moving in on ProtagonistA's village 
 ProtagonistA quickly alerted ProtagonistA's fellow Fox - men , and they were able to defend the village and drive the enemy away 
 ProtagonistA was a hero , and ProtagonistA will never be forgotten 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider 
 ProtagonistA tried to make the best of it , though , and rose through the ranks of the great Kingdom of Equestria from its tier - one position , into a far more stable , if very large , position 
 ProtagonistA made many friends along the way , but always felt like ProtagonistA was on the outside looking in 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to confront ProtagonistA's feelings head on 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's parents and asked them why ProtagonistA had been conceived so long after they had met 
 ProtagonistA 're our special little snowflake 
 ProtagonistA was their special little snowflake , and ProtagonistA was proud of it 
ProtagonistA is sitting with ProtagonistA's wings folded , legs crossed at the navel 
 ProtagonistA looks around the room and sees the other birds perched on their perches 
 ProtagonistA feels a little out of place 
 ProtagonistA starts to fidget and ProtagonistA's wings begin to flap 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA loses ProtagonistA's balance and falls off ProtagonistA's perch 
 ProtagonistA falls to the ground with a thud 
 ProtagonistA hangs ProtagonistA's head in shame and decides to leave the room 
 ProtagonistA 'll come back later when ProtagonistA 's feeling more like ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been searching through the hospital wing for hours , looking for the right book 
 ProtagonistA had been to the blue drawers a hundred times , but ProtagonistA just could n't find what ProtagonistA was looking for 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up and go to ProtagonistA's office when ProtagonistA heard a voice in the crowd 
 ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistA , over here!It was ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so relieved to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 've been looking for ProtagonistB everywhere 
 What are ProtagonistA looking for , ProtagonistA book 
 ProtagonistA need to find it before ProtagonistA's appointment 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA had been looking for hours and the book was in ProtagonistA's office the whole time 
 ProtagonistA do n't know what ProtagonistA would have done without ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA stood at the edge of the cliff , ProtagonistA's head down and eyes wide , looking out into the ocean beyond 
 ProtagonistA could see the waves crashing against the rocks below , and the seagulls flying overhead 
 ProtagonistA had always loved the ocean , and ProtagonistA knew that this was ProtagonistA's final moments 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and took a deep breath , then stepped off the cliff 
 ProtagonistA was the same way 
 ProtagonistA was always looking for new adventures and new people to meet 
 ProtagonistA was never content to stay in one place for too long 
 ProtagonistA came in one day and I could tell ProtagonistA was different from the other customers 
 ProtagonistA had an air of excitement about ProtagonistA that was contagious 
 ProtagonistA was the best friend I ever had 
 I had n't seen ProtagonistA in a few months and I had no idea ProtagonistA was sick 
ProtagonistA leaned ProtagonistA's head back against the window of the airplane and peered into the sea below 
 ProtagonistA had always loved flying , and the ocean was one of ProtagonistA's favorite things to look at from above 
 ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace looking at it 
ProtagonistA turned at the last minute to see ProtagonistB sitting on the bank watching ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 're going to get wet 
   ProtagonistA know ,  ProtagonistA said 
  But ProtagonistA really want to catch a fish 
  And ProtagonistA 're not going to have any bait if ProtagonistA do n't have a worm 
   ProtagonistA know ,  ProtagonistA said 
  But ProtagonistA really want to catch a fish 
  ProtagonistA smiled and went into the water 
 ProtagonistA did n't catch any fish but ProtagonistA had a lot of fun 
ProtagonistA sat looking up from the book lying on ProtagonistA's lap in the shade of a tree 
 ProtagonistA had been reading for hours , but ProtagonistA was so engrossed in the story that ProtagonistA had lost track of time 
 ProtagonistA squinted and put a hand up to shade ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was the only one left in the park 
 ProtagonistA got up and brushed the dirt off ProtagonistA's pants 
 ProtagonistA put the book in ProtagonistA's backpack and started walking home 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's saddled legs and stared down at ProtagonistA's hooves , wondering what the terror of the demon spell cast down on the citizens should have been like 
 ProtagonistA had been in the thick of the battle , fighting tooth and nail against the demons that had come to destroy their town 
 ProtagonistA had been the only one who had been able to resist the spell and now ProtagonistA was the only one left 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do or where to go 
 ProtagonistA was the only one left who could save the town , but ProtagonistA did n't know how 
 ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's saddle legs and stared down at ProtagonistA's hooves , wondering what ProtagonistA could do to save the town 
When ProtagonistA's parents must have been sleeping soundly , ProtagonistA had a passion for all things water - related , from swimming to pot - dancing 
 One night , while they slept , ProtagonistA snuck out of the house and made ProtagonistA's way to the river 
 ProtagonistA stripped down to ProtagonistA's birthday suit and jumped in , feeling the cool water envelop ProtagonistA's body 
 ProtagonistA swam and played for hours , only coming out when the sun began to rise 
 ProtagonistA tiptoed back into the house , hoping not to wake ProtagonistA's parents , but alas , they were already awake and waiting for ProtagonistA 
  We 've been worried sick !  ProtagonistA simply smiled and said ,  ProtagonistA went for a swim 
ProtagonistA leaned against the tree , ProtagonistA's eyes closed and ProtagonistA's mouth hanging open 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and was now exhausted 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure where ProtagonistA was , or where ProtagonistA was going 
 ProtagonistA just kept walking , until ProtagonistA could n't walk any further 
 ProtagonistA was thirsty , and hungry , but ProtagonistA did n't have the energy to search for food or water 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to rest 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure how long ProtagonistA had been leaning against the tree , but ProtagonistA must have dozed off , because the next thing ProtagonistA knew , someone was shaking ProtagonistA awake 
 ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes to see ProtagonistB standing in front of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA drank the water and ate the food , and then asked ProtagonistB who ProtagonistB was 
 ProtagonistA then asked ProtagonistB where ProtagonistA was , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ProtagonistA was in the forest 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for the food and water , and then asked ProtagonistB to show ProtagonistA the way out of the forest 
 ProtagonistA was very grateful to ProtagonistB , and they became good friends 
ProtagonistA was a horse who loved to stare at the world 
 ProtagonistA would raise ProtagonistA's hoof to ProtagonistA's face and just stare 
 ProtagonistA loved the way the world looked from up high 
 ProtagonistA was so excited 
 ProtagonistA loved going for rides 
 ProtagonistA was scared 
 ProtagonistA tried to raise ProtagonistA's hoof to ProtagonistA's face , but ProtagonistA could n't 
 ProtagonistA was holding on for dear life 
 ProtagonistA was so relieved 
ProtagonistA stood there , still wearing ProtagonistA's royal blue dress 
 ProtagonistA loved how ProtagonistA looked in it 
 ProtagonistA felt like a princess 
 ProtagonistA twirled around , the skirt spinning out around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA laughed and then stopped when ProtagonistA saw the look on ProtagonistB's face 
 I do n't care ,  ProtagonistA said , pouting 
 It 's just a dress ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to change , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to 
 ProtagonistA slowly trudged up the stairs , the skirt of ProtagonistA's dress dragging behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA changed into a pair of jeans and a t - shirt and then went back downstairs 
 ProtagonistA did n't look at ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA walked past ProtagonistB and went outside to play 
ProtagonistA wandered the quiet , wet wasteland of the forest , ProtagonistA's eyes scanning the thicket just outside the thicket 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and ProtagonistA's stomach was growling 
 ProtagonistA was just about to give up and turn back when ProtagonistA saw something shining in the distance 
 ProtagonistA walked towards it , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized it was a golden apple 
 ProtagonistA picked it up and brushed the dirt off of it 
 ProtagonistA took a bite , and it was the most delicious thing ProtagonistA had ever tasted 
 ProtagonistA ate the whole thing , and then ProtagonistA felt a sudden surge of energy 
 ProtagonistA walked for hours more , and ProtagonistA eventually found ProtagonistA's way out of the forest 
 ProtagonistA was tired , but ProtagonistA felt great 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget the day ProtagonistA found the golden apple 
ProtagonistA was the only member of ProtagonistA's family who had not been disemboweled 
 ProtagonistA was the black sheep , the outcast , the one who did n't fit in 
 ProtagonistA did n't know why , and ProtagonistA did n't know how long ProtagonistA's luck would last 
 ProtagonistA was constantly looking over ProtagonistA's shoulder , waiting for the axe to fall 
 ProtagonistA had no idea who was behind the murders , or why they had been targeted 
 All ProtagonistA knew was that ProtagonistA was next 
 One night , ProtagonistA was asleep in ProtagonistA's bed when ProtagonistA was awakened by a noise 
 ProtagonistA got up to investigate and found ProtagonistA's parents ' killer in ProtagonistA's room 
 ProtagonistA was the final victim in a string of murders that shocked the small town ProtagonistA lived in 
ProtagonistA was sitting on ProtagonistA's own , with a book in one hand and a pile of feathers in the other 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a loud noise 
 ProtagonistA got up and looked around , but ProtagonistA could n't see anyone 
 ProtagonistA decided to go back to ProtagonistA's book , but the noise got louder and closer 
 ProtagonistA got up again and looked around , but still could n't see anyone 
 Just as ProtagonistA was about to go back to ProtagonistA's book , ProtagonistA saw a small , furry creature running towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA just sat there for a moment , with ProtagonistA's book in one hand and a pile of feathers in the other 
ProtagonistA was a horse , and a very good horse at that 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's way around the farm better than any other horse , and ProtagonistA was always the one that the other horses went to for advice 
 So when ProtagonistB came to the farm , ProtagonistA was the first to welcome ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistB , said ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's hoof hovering over the apple cart 
 One day , ProtagonistA came by the apple cart and ProtagonistB was n't there 
 ProtagonistA looked around for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB was nowhere to be found 
 ProtagonistA eventually found ProtagonistB in the pasture , grazing on some grass 
ProtagonistA sat down on the bench opposite ProtagonistC and looked around 
 ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB and a young couple playing frisbee 
 ProtagonistA smiled and turned to ProtagonistC 
  Is n't it a great day ?  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA was surprised , but shrugged it off and went back to people watching 
 ProtagonistA was determined to make the most of the time they had left together , and so ProtagonistA had decided to take ProtagonistB on a road trip to see all the sights that ProtagonistB had always wanted to see 
 ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to keep ProtagonistB comfortable , but there was only so much ProtagonistA could do 
 ProtagonistA had promised ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would see the trip through to the end 
 So , with a heavy heart , ProtagonistA loaded ProtagonistB's body into the car and continued on their journey 
 ProtagonistA stopped at all the places that ProtagonistB had wanted to see , and ProtagonistA took pictures and made notes so that ProtagonistA could share the experience with others 
 It was a difficult journey , but in the end , it was one that ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA made 
ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way back to ProtagonistA's office when ProtagonistA saw the great city of Ponyville once again 
 ProtagonistA had been away on business for a few weeks and was glad to be home 
 As ProtagonistA walked through the streets , ProtagonistA saw many familiar faces and felt a sense of comfort 
 ProtagonistA knew that no matter what happened in the outside world , ProtagonistA could always count on the people of Ponyville to be there for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA looks around the room , taking in the other people seated in a circle around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA can feel the sweat beginning to form on ProtagonistA's forehead and ProtagonistA wipes it away with ProtagonistA's sleeve 
 ProtagonistA takes a deep breath and wills ProtagonistA to calm down 
 ProtagonistA does n't want to lose ProtagonistA's temper , not here , not now 
 ProtagonistA knows that if ProtagonistA does , ProtagonistA 'll only make things worse 
 ProtagonistA has been to these types of meetings before , but this one feels different 
 ProtagonistA ca n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but there is an air of tension in the room that was n't there before 
 ProtagonistA tries to pay attention , but ProtagonistA ca n't focus 
 ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's temper and said some things ProtagonistA regretted 
 ProtagonistA does n't want to make the same mistake again , but ProtagonistA can feel ProtagonistA's anger bubbling up inside of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA takes a few deep breaths and tries to focus on the discussion , but it 's hard 
 ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA needs to leave before ProtagonistA says something ProtagonistA 'll regret , but ProtagonistA does n't want to make a scene 
 ProtagonistA can feel everyone 's eyes on ProtagonistA , and the pressure is too much 
 Finally , ProtagonistA ca n't take it anymore and ProtagonistA explodes 
 ProtagonistA yells at ProtagonistB , telling ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB 's a fraud and that this whole meeting is a waste of time 
 ProtagonistA then storms out of the room , leaving the others behind 
 ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA should n't have lost ProtagonistA's temper like that , but ProtagonistA ca n't help it 
 ProtagonistA 's so angry and frustrated 
 ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA needs to calm down , but ProtagonistA ca n't 
 ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA 's about to explode 
 ProtagonistA goes for a walk , trying to clear ProtagonistA's head , but it does n't help 
 ProtagonistA 's still so angry and ProtagonistA does n't know what to do 
ProtagonistA leaned against the tree , ProtagonistA's hooves tugging at the bark of the tree 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA liked it 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and sighed 
ProtagonistA leaned against the tree , ProtagonistA's gaze scanning the atmosphere 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes nearby 
 Was it a animal , or something more sinister ? ProtagonistA tensed up , preparing for the worst , when a small rabbit hopped out from the undergrowth 
 ProtagonistA let out a sigh of relief and laughed at ProtagonistA for being so jumpy 
ProtagonistA stood there , ProtagonistA's hooves resting on the ground 
 ProtagonistA was a big horse , and ProtagonistA knew it 
 ProtagonistA was the king of the pasture , and ProtagonistA liked it that way 
 ProtagonistA did n't like that 
 ProtagonistA wanted to show the new horse who was boss 
 So , ProtagonistA walked over to the new horse , and ProtagonistA gave it a good kick 
 ProtagonistA had shown the new horse who was in charge 
ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA was exhausted 
 ProtagonistA had been planning to camp for the night , but ProtagonistA could n't find a good spot 
 ProtagonistA had seen a few places that would work , but they were all taken by other campers 
 Finally , ProtagonistA came to a clearing and saw a tree 
 ProtagonistA sat down on the side of the tree , ProtagonistA's leg dangling past the tip 
 ProtagonistA was just about to drift off to sleep when ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA sat up and looked around , but ProtagonistA could n't see anyone 
 ProtagonistA was about to lie back down when ProtagonistA heard the noise again 
 ProtagonistA slowly got to ProtagonistA's feet and crept around the tree 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA turned and ran as fast as ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA did n't stop running until ProtagonistA was back at ProtagonistA's car 
 ProtagonistA had never been so scared in ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA was having a great day 
 ProtagonistA was out in the park , enjoying the sunshine and the fresh air 
 And ProtagonistA had a bag of delicious cupcakes 
 ProtagonistA was just about to take a bite of one when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB watching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but smile back 
 ProtagonistA was more than happy to share ProtagonistA's cupcakes with ProtagonistB 
 And ProtagonistA could n't stop smiling 
 ProtagonistA was just happy to be spending time with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been in the room for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting tired of the darkness and the silence 
 ProtagonistA was starting to think that maybe ProtagonistA should just take the watch - thing off ProtagonistA's head and leave the room , when ProtagonistA heard a voice 
 ProtagonistA got up and went to the door , and ProtagonistA put ProtagonistA's ear to it 
  Yes , ProtagonistA 'm still here ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'm not sure how much longer ProtagonistA can stay in here 
  ProtagonistA heard the sound of footsteps getting closer , and then the door opened 
  ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB left the room , and they did n't look back 
ProtagonistA was at the dinner party waiting for ProtagonistB , to apologize for not coming sooner 
 ProtagonistA did n't mind , though 
ProtagonistA blinked at the moon and saw the glitter of the friends ' tears around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it before 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friend were standing on the edge of a stream 
  ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA bet ProtagonistA can 
  ProtagonistA said ,  Watch this 
  ProtagonistA picked up a rock and skipped it across the water 
  ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA told you ProtagonistA could 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the seat of a beach cruiser , ProtagonistA's tail wagging 
 ProtagonistA was enjoying the wind in ProtagonistA's fur and the sun on ProtagonistA's face 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA saw a rabbit running across the sand 
 ProtagonistA jumped out of the seat and took off after the rabbit 
 ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life until ProtagonistA ran into a tree and knocked ProtagonistA out 
 ProtagonistA was beginning to get quite worn out , though ProtagonistA had n't intended for ProtagonistA's obsession to get out of control 
 ProtagonistA began to follow ProtagonistB around , always begging for just one more 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been taking advantage of ProtagonistB's kindness and that ProtagonistA needed to get help 
 With the help of ProtagonistA's friends , ProtagonistA was able to get ProtagonistA's cupcake obsession under control 
 ProtagonistA apologized to ProtagonistB and they were able to remain friends 
ProtagonistA sat down on the edge of the bank , crossed ProtagonistA's legs , and stared out at the sea beyond the bank 
 ProtagonistA had always loved the ocean , ever since ProtagonistA was a little boy 
 Even now , as an old man , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel the same sense of wonder and awe that ProtagonistA had felt all those years ago 
 ProtagonistA watched as the waves crashed against the shore , the sun glinting off the water 
 ProtagonistA breathed in the salty air and felt the wind blowing through ProtagonistA's hair 
 It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was glad to be alive to see it 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB , standing a few feet away 
 ProtagonistA nodded and got to ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistA took one last look at the ocean , then turned and walked back to ProtagonistA's car with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes 
 ProtagonistA was a bit tired , having made it three hours from here and had no idea how much longer that would last 
 ProtagonistA had been driving for two days straight and was starting to feel it 
 ProtagonistA had been on the road for a week , ever since ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's home in Maine 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to live there and now ProtagonistA finally had the chance 
 ProtagonistA had been making good time , but now ProtagonistA was starting to run out of gas 
 ProtagonistA pulled over to the side of the road and got out ProtagonistA's map 
 ProtagonistA figured ProtagonistA was about a day 's drive from the nearest town 
 ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA could make it that far , but ProtagonistA had to try 
 ProtagonistA got back in ProtagonistA's car and started driving 
 ProtagonistA was getting low on gas , but ProtagonistA kept going 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to stop and ProtagonistA did n't want to turn back 
 ProtagonistA had come too far to give up now 
 ProtagonistA drove for another hour before ProtagonistA finally ran out of gas 
 ProtagonistA coasted to a stop and just sat there for a moment , trying to figure out what to do 
 ProtagonistA got out of the car and started walking 
 ProtagonistA had no idea how far it was to the nearest town , but ProtagonistA was determined to make it 
 ProtagonistA walked for hours , but ProtagonistA never saw a town 
 ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA was going in circles 
 ProtagonistA was getting tired and hungry and ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA sat down to rest for a moment and ProtagonistA must have dozed off , because the next thing ProtagonistA knew , it was morning 
 ProtagonistA got up and kept walking 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , but ProtagonistA was no closer to a town 
 ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA was never going to make it 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw a sign for the town ProtagonistA was looking for 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA had made it 
 ProtagonistA walked into town and got something to eat 
 ProtagonistA was tired , but ProtagonistA was happy 
 ProtagonistA had made it to ProtagonistA's new home 
 ProtagonistA expected to find an elderly , dainty man sitting beside ProtagonistA , but instead ProtagonistA found a large , hairy man who was taking up most of the seat 
 ProtagonistA was disgusted and tried to move to the other side of the train , but the man 's body was taking up so much space that ProtagonistA could n't squeeze past 
 ProtagonistA sat there for the rest of the ride , trying not to touch the man or breathe in his stench 
 ProtagonistA quickly got up and rushed off the train , glad to be away from the disgusting man 
ProtagonistA , dressed in the highest style , sat down in the low dining - room of ProtagonistA's house on the bank of the Thames 
 ProtagonistA had just returned from a successful business trip to New York and was in a celebratory mood 
 ProtagonistA ordered the finest wine and the most expensive meal on the menu 
 As ProtagonistA waited for ProtagonistA's food , ProtagonistA looked out the window at the river flowing by 
 ProtagonistA was content and happy 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a loud splash 
 ProtagonistA got up to see what it was and saw ProtagonistB struggling in the water 
 Without thinking , ProtagonistA ran outside and jumped in 
 ProtagonistA was a strong swimmer and quickly reached ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA pulled ProtagonistB to safety and performed CPR until ProtagonistB revived 
 ProtagonistA was a hero 
 ProtagonistA had saved a life 
 But ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA was just glad ProtagonistA was able to help 
ProtagonistA sat down on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked down at the blank gray blue horizon 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and ProtagonistA's stomach was empty 
 ProtagonistA had been following a trail of bread crumbs , but they had long since been eaten by birds 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure where ProtagonistA was or where ProtagonistA was going 
 ProtagonistA only knew that ProtagonistA had to keep moving 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance 
 ProtagonistA got up and started walking towards the sound 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB huddled on the ground 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to scare ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA did n't want to leave ProtagonistB alone either 
 Finally , ProtagonistA decided to speak to ProtagonistB 
 Hello there ,  ProtagonistA said softly 
 ProtagonistA knew how ProtagonistB felt 
 ProtagonistA had been in the same situation not too long ago 
 Don't worry ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'll help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's way home 
ProtagonistA was a horse , and ProtagonistA was very proud of the fact that ProtagonistA had once saved the life of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had seen what had happened and had galloped over to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had nudged ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's nose and whinnied loudly , until ProtagonistB had finally regained consciousness 
 Now , ProtagonistA was getting old , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would soon be retired 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have had such a long and eventful life , and ProtagonistA loved spending ProtagonistA's days in the stable , talking to the other horses about all the things ProtagonistA had seen and done 
  ProtagonistA hated it when ProtagonistB rushed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistB would just let ProtagonistA take ProtagonistA's time 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to take ProtagonistB's advice and hurry up 
 ProtagonistA rushed through ProtagonistA's breakfast and ran out the door 
 ProtagonistA did n't even say goodbye to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to get to school and get it over with 
 But when ProtagonistA got to school , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's backpack at home 
 ProtagonistA had to go all the way back home to get it 
 ProtagonistA was so embarrassed 
  Now ProtagonistA 're going to be late for school 
  ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA had just listened to ProtagonistB in the first place 
 ProtagonistA was advancing towards the brides , wearing a pointed black frock , a black skirt even shorter than ProtagonistA's hips , and heels that reached just below ProtagonistA's knees 
ProtagonistA was always a good listener 
 ProtagonistA never interrupted when ProtagonistB was talking , and ProtagonistA always had a kind word to say 
 It 's all right , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said comfortingly 
  ProtagonistA 'm always here for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been out of work for weeks and was down to ProtagonistA's last few dollars 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping to find a job today , but so far , no luck 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up and go home when ProtagonistA heard the call 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't ignore it 
 ProtagonistA had to help 
 ProtagonistA scrambled down the bank and ran towards the sound 
 ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB in the water , struggling to stay afloat 
 ProtagonistA did n't hesitate 
 ProtagonistA jumped in and pulled ProtagonistB to safety 
 ProtagonistA had just saved a life 
ProtagonistA had taken to riding into ProtagonistA's house on ProtagonistA's pink saddle hoof , noting the rows of fifth - story windows that led from ProtagonistA's backyard down into the city 
 One day , as ProtagonistA was trotting along , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling to ProtagonistA from one of the windows 
 ProtagonistA steered his hoof over to ProtagonistB's window and stopped 
 Hello , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
 Of course ,  ProtagonistA said 
 Of course ProtagonistA 'll help ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
 A few days later , ProtagonistA was back at ProtagonistB's window , helping ProtagonistB to carry ProtagonistB's things down to the street 
 ProtagonistA was happy to help ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would appreciate it 
 It was no problem ,  ProtagonistA said 
 And with that , ProtagonistA trotted off , back to ProtagonistA's house , feeling good about ProtagonistA and the good deed ProtagonistA had done 
 ProtagonistA was always friendly and would always go out of ProtagonistA's way to help the customers 
 One day , ProtagonistA was helping ProtagonistB 
Tilting ProtagonistA back , ProtagonistA looked up at the stars above 
 ProtagonistA felt a sense of wonder and peace looking at the infinite number of stars 
ProtagonistA was sketching a town in the snow , when ProtagonistA turned to see the stars shining brightly in the evening sky 
 Instead , ProtagonistA just sat there and stared at the stars until it was time to go home 
ProtagonistA sighed as ProtagonistA watched her friends ride into the forest 
 ProtagonistA had wanted to go with them , but ProtagonistA's horse was lame and ProtagonistA could n't risk injuring it further 
 ProtagonistA knew the forest was dangerous , but ProtagonistA's friends were strong and capable riders 
 ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's horse around and headed back to the stables 
 ProtagonistA would have to find something else to do today 
 Maybe ProtagonistA would go into town and see if there was anything happening there 
 As ProtagonistA rode into town , ProtagonistA saw a group of men gathered around something 
 ProtagonistA rode closer to see what was going on 
 ProtagonistA did n't have any money to gamble with , but ProtagonistA watched for a while anyway 
 As ProtagonistA rode out of town , ProtagonistA saw the men from the gambling ring 
 ProtagonistA sighed 
 ProtagonistA should have known better than to let ProtagonistA's friends ride into the forest without ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's horse around and rode as fast as ProtagonistA could back to the stables 
 ProtagonistA would have to go after them 
 ProtagonistA just hoped ProtagonistA was n't too late 
ProtagonistA stepped carefully down the steps of ProtagonistA's trailer , ProtagonistA's eyes resting on the blackened metal 
 It had been a long time since ProtagonistA 'd been out here , and everything looked different 
 Now , ProtagonistA was alone 
 ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way to the edge of the property , where the metal fence was 
 ProtagonistA leaned against it , looking out at the view 
 ProtagonistA could see the city in the distance , and it looked so different from up here 
 ProtagonistA sighed , wondering what ProtagonistA was doing here 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't go back to the city 
 ProtagonistA did n't have anything there anymore 
 But ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do out here , either 
 ProtagonistA supposed ProtagonistA would just have to take it one day at a time 
ProtagonistA stood in the dim light of the distance , ProtagonistA's face downcast and blue eyes fixed on the ground below 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and blistered 
 ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was or where ProtagonistA was going 
 ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's home in the city days ago , after a huge argument with ProtagonistA's parents 
 ProtagonistA had been wandering aimlessly ever since 
 ProtagonistA was tired and hungry , and ProtagonistA's stomach was growling 
 ProtagonistA had no money and no food 
 ProtagonistA had been sleeping in parks and on benches , and ProtagonistA was dirty and disheveled 
 ProtagonistA had thought about going back home , but ProtagonistA was too proud and stubborn 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to admit that ProtagonistA had made a mistake 
 ProtagonistA continued to walk , not knowing where to go or what to do 
 ProtagonistA felt lost and alone 
 As the sun began to set , ProtagonistA saw a sign for a small town up ahead 
 ProtagonistA decided to go there and see if ProtagonistA could find a place to stay for the night 
 As ProtagonistA entered the town , ProtagonistA was surprised to see that it was very quaint and charming 
 ProtagonistA walked down the main street , looking for a place to stay 
 ProtagonistA saw a sign for a bed and breakfast , and ProtagonistA decided to go there 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door , and ProtagonistB answered 
 ProtagonistA explained ProtagonistA's situation , and ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA in 
 ProtagonistA was so grateful 
 The next morning , ProtagonistA woke up refreshed and ready to start a new day 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's kindness , and ProtagonistA set off down the road , feeling hopeful for the first time in days 
ProtagonistA , took a moment to admire the view 
 ProtagonistA felt alive and free 
ProtagonistA leaned against the tree , ProtagonistA's hooves strumming happily 
 ProtagonistA was a horse , and ProtagonistA loved life 
 ProtagonistA loved the smell of the fresh , green grass , and the feel of the warm sun on ProtagonistA's back 
 ProtagonistA was happy just to be alive 
ProtagonistA stood before ProtagonistA's desk , looking at the empty chair across from ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had changed 
 ProtagonistA was no longer the same person ProtagonistA had been when they first met 
 ProtagonistA had been through too much , and seen too much 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would never understand what ProtagonistA had become 
 ProtagonistA did n't need anyone 's understanding 
 All ProtagonistA needed was to be left alone 
 ProtagonistA turned away from the empty chair and sat down at ProtagonistA's desk 
ProtagonistA was wiping the sweat away from ProtagonistA's forehead when ProtagonistA saw the light 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting tired 
 ProtagonistA had been following the light since ProtagonistA saw it in the distance , and ProtagonistA was hoping it would lead ProtagonistA to somewhere safe 
 ProtagonistA started to walk towards it , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was a campfire 
 ProtagonistA was so relieved that ProtagonistA almost cried 
 ProtagonistA walked into the camp and saw that there were people there 
 ProtagonistA was just happy to be safe 
ProtagonistA blasted ProtagonistA's horn into the air and dropped down to the floor , hovering there , impossible 
 ProtagonistA had been practicing this move for weeks and finally perfected it 
 After all , ProtagonistA had been walking through that door for years , and never once had ProtagonistA been greeted with anything but a cold , hard stare 
 ProtagonistA could feel it the moment ProtagonistA stepped foot into the dragon 's lair 
 It was as if the creature had finally realized that ProtagonistA was not a threat , but a friend 
ProtagonistA leaned against the trees , ProtagonistA's head resting lightly on the large , fat trunk 
 ProtagonistA was tired from a long day of work and just wanted to rest for a few minutes 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let out a deep breath 
 ProtagonistA could hear the birds singing and the leaves rustling in the breeze 
ProtagonistA stroked the buttons of ProtagonistA's blouse , feeling the softness beneath ProtagonistA's skin 
 ProtagonistA loved the way the fabric felt against ProtagonistA's fingertips and the way it clung to ProtagonistA's body 
 ProtagonistA could feel the eyes of the other women in the room on ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA knew they were jealous of ProtagonistA's beautiful blouse 
 ProtagonistA smiled to ProtagonistA and continued to stroke the buttons , feeling the softness of the fabric 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA was not interested in anything ProtagonistB had to offer , and ProtagonistB was not about to force ProtagonistB on someone who did n't want ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA sat on the bank , ProtagonistA's hooves carefully below the surface of the water , ProtagonistA's flat chest and shy muzzle showing the attention of the natural beauty 
 ProtagonistA watched as the colors danced across the water and ProtagonistA felt at peace 
 ProtagonistA knew that this was a special place and ProtagonistA was lucky to have found it 
ProtagonistA was a horse who loved to sit on the ground 
 ProtagonistA would sit for hours , ProtagonistA's hooves resting in front of ProtagonistA , and just enjoy the world around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA wanted to help the rabbit , but ProtagonistA did n't know how 
 Then ProtagonistA had an idea 
 ProtagonistA started to stomp ProtagonistA's hooves on the ground as hard as ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA could help 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's saddle and watched the sun rise over the high hills 
 ProtagonistA was a simple man , and ProtagonistA loved simple things 
 ProtagonistA loved the smell of the fresh air in the morning , and ProtagonistA loved the sound of the birds singing 
 ProtagonistA loved the feel of the saddle beneath ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA loved the way the horse 's hooves made a soft thudding sound on the ground 
 ProtagonistA was content just to sit there and watch the world wake up around ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA sat down on the golden throne in ProtagonistA's tower , and ProtagonistA looked out at the sea of stars that stretched before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had always loved the stars , and ProtagonistA used to dream of being one of them 
 Now , ProtagonistA was the ruler of the galaxy , and ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA could ever want 
 ProtagonistA missed the days when ProtagonistA would just sit and dream about them 
ProtagonistA , sat at ProtagonistB's desk , ProtagonistA's hooves resting on the very smooth surface of the paper 
 ProtagonistA had been a gift to ProtagonistB from ProtagonistB's daughter , and ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA dearly 
 ProtagonistA was always so well - behaved , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB just as much 
 Why do n't ProtagonistA go and play with ProtagonistA's toys for a little while?Amber seemed to understand , and ProtagonistA trotted off to the other room 
ProtagonistA stood in the doorway of the bank , and the crystal ball was spinning in ProtagonistA's fingers 
 ProtagonistA had been planning this heist for months , and everything was finally falling into place 
 ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB pacing back and forth in the lobby , and the tellers busy at their stations 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to act fast 
 ProtagonistA walked into the bank and approached ProtagonistB 
 Pretending to trip , ProtagonistA dropped the crystal ball 
 As ProtagonistB bent down to help ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA grabbed ProtagonistA's gun and pointed it at ProtagonistB 
  This is a robbery ,  ProtagonistA yelled 
 ProtagonistA could hear the sirens in the distance , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA had gotten away with the perfect crime 
ProtagonistA cracked open ProtagonistA's newspaper , nudged the option beneath the headline Today , ProtagonistA was going to write a story about ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA whistled an old , hoof - tired tune as ProtagonistA peered around the edge of ProtagonistA's cottage at the vast , arid expanse beyond the great umbrella of emerald leaves that crowned the ceiling 
 But ProtagonistA could n't help but stare at the beauty of the land before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been living in this cottage for years , and it never ceased to amaze ProtagonistA how different the world looked from up here 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around , heart pounding , but there was nothing there 
 Just the wind , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that someone was watching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA quickly went back inside and locked the door 
ProtagonistA sat up on the front step of the house with ProtagonistA's eyes closed 
 ProtagonistA had been sitting there for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had arrived home from work 
 ProtagonistA was too tired to go inside , too tired to even move 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to sit there and relax , and maybe doze off for a little while 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw ProtagonistB approaching 
 As ProtagonistB got closer , ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistB was a woman 
 ProtagonistA just moved here ProtagonistA 
  Yes?You can stay here ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA have a spare bedroom , and ProtagonistB 're welcome to use it 
  Thank ProtagonistA so much ! ProtagonistA 're a lifesaver 
 ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's feet and led ProtagonistB into the house 
 ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB to the spare bedroom , and ProtagonistB gratefully accepted ProtagonistA's offer 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what had come over ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA had been able to help ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had been driving home from the hospital after a terrible accident in which ProtagonistA had been struck by a bus 
 It was a miracle that ProtagonistA had survived , but ProtagonistA was still in a great deal of pain 
 As ProtagonistA drove , ProtagonistA saw a dark figure in the road ahead of ProtagonistA 
 At first , ProtagonistA thought it was a trick of the light , but as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that it was a person 
 ProtagonistA slammed on the brakes , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistA hit the figure , and it flew through the air , landing in a ditch by the side of the road 
 ProtagonistA got out of ProtagonistA's car to see if the person was all right , but there was no sign of life 
 ProtagonistA had killed someone 
ProtagonistA had been working at the desk for a few weeks now , and ProtagonistA had yet to find a way to get ProtagonistA's notebook out of the trunk behind the desk 
 ProtagonistA knew it was there , ProtagonistA just could n't seem to find a way to get to it 
 ProtagonistA tried a few different things , but none of them seemed to work 
 Finally , ProtagonistA just decided to go for it and see what happened 
 ProtagonistA reached into the trunk and grabbed ProtagonistA's notebook 
ProtagonistA was a hasty and groping traveller , always carrying some form of burdens on ProtagonistA's back , but the Seven Seas of Latron on the banks of the river had always been a friendlier place 
 ProtagonistA had first come here years ago , when ProtagonistA was just a boy , and the river had always been a place of solace for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA would come here to think , to be alone with ProtagonistA's thoughts , and to escape the hustle and bustle of the city 
 But now , as ProtagonistA approached the river , ProtagonistA could see that something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that the banks of the river were covered in garbage 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA stood there for a moment , staring at the river in disbelief , before turning and walking away 
 ProtagonistA would never come back here again 
ProtagonistA was going through ProtagonistA's old keepsakes and came across a little book 
 ProtagonistA picked it up and examined it 
  Why are ProtagonistA going through these keepsakes ?  ProtagonistA said to ProtagonistA 
  Is there something ProtagonistA 're looking for ?  ProtagonistA flipped through the pages of the book and came across a picture of ProtagonistA as a foal 
 ProtagonistA smiled at the memory and put the book down 
 ProtagonistA continued to go through ProtagonistA's keepsakes , but ProtagonistA could n't help but wonder why ProtagonistA was going through them 
ProtagonistA had been through so much , so many times , that ProtagonistA 'd reached the point where ProtagonistA 'd stopped caring what happened to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 'd been through heartbreak , loss , and betrayal , and ProtagonistA was tired of it all 
 ProtagonistA was tired of feeling like ProtagonistA was the only one who cared about anything 
 So , when ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistA did n't even shed a tear 
 ProtagonistA just shrugged it off and went on with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistB again 
 And when ProtagonistC left ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA did n't even try to stop ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA just let ProtagonistC go and went on with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistC was gone 
 ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistA would never see ProtagonistC again 
 ProtagonistA had reached the point where nothing mattered to ProtagonistA anymore 
 ProtagonistA was just going through the motions of life , without any real purpose or meaning 
 ProtagonistA was just existing , not living 
 And ProtagonistA was okay with that 
ProtagonistA stepped out of the greenhouse , whirled , and threw ProtagonistA's head back 
 ProtagonistA had forgotten ProtagonistA's coat inside and now ProtagonistA regretted it 
 ProtagonistA turned back to the greenhouse to go get it when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB in the distance 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was , but ProtagonistA had a feeling ProtagonistA was going to find out 
 And so it happened that one day , when ProtagonistA was out walking with ProtagonistA's grandfather , ProtagonistA saw a pair of shoes lying in the grass 
 ProtagonistA picked them up and put them on ProtagonistA's feet , and they fit perfectly 
 ProtagonistA knew that this was the moment ProtagonistA had been waiting for 
I remember ProtagonistA ; and I remember , too , that ProtagonistA was born a little after the year 1852 , that ProtagonistA was of the small family , of the same kind as myself , though no one of that family should have been more than ten years my senior ; and that ProtagonistB , had no money , which only bordered on the imaginary , while ProtagonistB had everything else desired , and that everything ProtagonistB asked for was granted ProtagonistB without any regard to the wants of others 
 I never had anything that ProtagonistA wanted , and ProtagonistA always had everything that I wanted ; but that never made any difference between us 
ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's wings for more than a year when ProtagonistA discovered what ProtagonistB , had been planning for a good long while 
 ProtagonistA was horrified and went to ProtagonistC to warn ProtagonistC 
ProtagonistA had always dreamed of sailing to the new world 
 ProtagonistA had heard tales of the vast riches that could be found there , and ProtagonistA was determined to find ProtagonistA's fortune 
 After months of searching , ProtagonistA finally struck gold 
 ProtagonistA had found more wealth than ProtagonistA could have ever imagined 
 ProtagonistA was able to return to ProtagonistA's home country a rich man , and ProtagonistA lived happily ever after 
ProtagonistA peered into ProtagonistA's book , half - listening , half - expecting ProtagonistB to speak 
 ProtagonistA had been sitting in the same spot for hours , lost in the world of ProtagonistA's book 
  ProtagonistA 've read that series like , five times 
 ProtagonistA know ,  ProtagonistA said 
  But ProtagonistA ca n't help it 
 ProtagonistA love it 
 They're more than that ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA sat down and just watched as ProtagonistB squatted beside ProtagonistA and watched ProtagonistA draw ProtagonistA's bow and day out 
 ProtagonistA had always been the better hunter , but ProtagonistB had never given up trying to beat ProtagonistA 
 I do n't doubt it ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA 'm going to have enough meat to last ProtagonistA the winter 
 Thanks for watching ,  ProtagonistA replied 
ProtagonistA had waited all summer for ProtagonistA's chance 
 ProtagonistA had been watching the house next door , and ProtagonistA knew that the family was going on vacation 
 ProtagonistA had planned everything out perfectly 
 ProtagonistA would break into the house while they were gone , and ProtagonistA would finally have a place to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was careful as ProtagonistA broke into the house 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to leave any evidence that ProtagonistA had been there 
 ProtagonistA went through the house , room by room , until ProtagonistA found what ProtagonistA was looking for 
 ProtagonistA went through their belongings , and ProtagonistA found a key 
 ProtagonistA smiled to ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA pocketed the key 
 Now that ProtagonistA had a key , ProtagonistA could come and go as ProtagonistA please 
 ProtagonistA would have a place to stay when ProtagonistA was in town , and ProtagonistA would n't have to worry about being caught 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's new found treasure , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never be caught 
ProtagonistA was walking home from ProtagonistA's last day of school when ProtagonistA was stopped by a reporter 
  No , ProtagonistA do n't think so ,  ProtagonistA replied 
  ProtagonistA 'm going to get a job and start ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA continued walking home , thinking about ProtagonistA's future 
 ProtagonistA was excited to start ProtagonistA's new life and make ProtagonistA's own way in the world 
ProtagonistA sat by ProtagonistA's window and hoped that the sun was n't up 
 ProtagonistA had been up all night , and ProtagonistA was exhausted 
 ProtagonistA wanted nothing more than to go to bed and sleep for a few hours 
 But ProtagonistA knew that if the sun was up , it would be time to start ProtagonistA's day 
 ProtagonistA would have to get up and go to work 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to go to work 
 ProtagonistA wanted to stay in bed and sleep 
 But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to go to work 
 ProtagonistA got up and got ready for ProtagonistA's day 
ProtagonistA sat at ProtagonistA's desk and watched as ProtagonistB leaned ProtagonistB's head onto ProtagonistA's shoulder 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistB's body relax as ProtagonistB took a deep breath and closed ProtagonistB's eyes 
 ProtagonistA thought about all of the things they had been through together 
 ProtagonistA remembered the time when they were both younger and ProtagonistB had gotten lost in the city 
 ProtagonistA had been so worried about ProtagonistB but ProtagonistB had always had a knack for finding ProtagonistB's way home 
 ProtagonistA also remembered the time when ProtagonistB had broken ProtagonistB's leg and ProtagonistA had to carry ProtagonistB's home 
 ProtagonistA felt grateful to have ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA wrapped ProtagonistA's arms around ProtagonistB and held ProtagonistB close 
ProtagonistA was walking home from school when ProtagonistA saw a man walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die 
 ProtagonistA tried to run , but the man was too fast 
 ProtagonistA felt the knife enter ProtagonistA's back and ProtagonistA fell to the ground 
 ProtagonistA could hear the screams of the people around ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA could not see them 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get out , but ProtagonistA did n't know how 
 Then ProtagonistA saw the door 
 ProtagonistA ran towards it , but the flames were too strong 
ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's home world of Equestria when ProtagonistA was eight years old 
 ProtagonistA had been on a quest to find a new world to call home 
 ProtagonistA had been searching for years , and ProtagonistA had finally found it 
 ProtagonistA had found a world that was perfect for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't have to pretend to be something ProtagonistA was n't 
 ProtagonistA could be ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could be happy 
ProtagonistA was lying on the floor of ProtagonistA's room , bending forward 
 ProtagonistA was trying to reach the remote that had fallen just out of ProtagonistA's reach 
 ProtagonistA could see it , just barely , but it might as well have been a mile away 
 ProtagonistA was just about to give up when ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB coming down the hall 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was in for it if ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA like this 
 ProtagonistA had to think fast 
Two days ago ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends had an idea : to set up a lemonade stand 
 ProtagonistA was so disappointed 
 ProtagonistA had really wanted this to work 
 But maybe next time ProtagonistA 'll have more luck 
ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistA's hoof out of ProtagonistB's eyes , but fished out a few strands of pony hair , like ProtagonistA always had 
 ProtagonistA was getting too old for this , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit nostalgic 
 ProtagonistA remembered the first time ProtagonistA had held ProtagonistB in ProtagonistA's hooves 
 ProtagonistA was afraid ProtagonistA would break ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB was perfect 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to let ProtagonistB go , but it was hard 
 ProtagonistA was going to miss ProtagonistB so much 
 ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB one last hug and then turned to leave 
 As ProtagonistA walked away , ProtagonistA felt a tear run down ProtagonistA's cheek 
ProtagonistA had been smoking for years , and ProtagonistA knew it was time to quit 
 ProtagonistA had tried before , but ProtagonistA always ended up going back to it 
 This time , ProtagonistA was determined to make it stick 
 ProtagonistA stopped smoking and looked up from the book ProtagonistA was reading 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to find that ProtagonistA did n't miss it as much as ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA would 
 In fact , ProtagonistA felt better than ProtagonistA had in a long time 
 ProtagonistA was able to breathe easier and ProtagonistA's cough had gone away 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have made the decision to quit and was proud of ProtagonistA for sticking to it 
ProtagonistA had been sleeping soundly when ProtagonistA was suddenly awoken by a loud noise 
 ProtagonistA sat up in bed , heart racing , and looked around ProtagonistA's room 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and walked to ProtagonistA's window , peering out into the darkness 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to act fast 
 ProtagonistA ran to ProtagonistA's door and locked it , then grabbed ProtagonistA's phone and called the police 
 ProtagonistA was shaking by the time they arrived , but ProtagonistA was relieved to see that the figure was gone 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what it was , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA never wanted to see it again 
ProtagonistA had always wished ProtagonistA had been born in a different time and place 
 ProtagonistA was the youngest of three children and ProtagonistA's family was not well off 
 ProtagonistA was a shy child and ProtagonistA did n't have many friends 
 ProtagonistA was always daydreaming about what it would be like to live in a different time or place 
 ProtagonistA would imagine ProtagonistA as a knight in shining armor or a brave explorer 
 ProtagonistA even daydreamed about being born in a different time so ProtagonistA could have been born into a wealthy family 
ProtagonistA was a horse who lived on a farm 
 ProtagonistA said yes , but ProtagonistA should have said no 
 ProtagonistA was not strong enough to pull the wagon and ProtagonistA ended up getting stuck 
 ProtagonistA was embarrassed and ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA had said no to the job 
ProtagonistA had been very pondering how to spend the week before wearing ProtagonistA's crown 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to be king , but ProtagonistA never imagined the responsibility that came with it 
 ProtagonistA had to make sure the kingdom was running smoothly and that everyone was happy 
 ProtagonistA also had to attend to ProtagonistA's royal duties , such as meeting with ambassadors and attending balls 
 ProtagonistA was happy to be able to help ProtagonistA's people and make them happy 
ProtagonistA had never managed to get used to the idea that ProtagonistA had to be the only pony on the grounds or the ground in order to do anything without prompting 
 Even now , as ProtagonistA stood in the middle of the field , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit self - conscious 
 ProtagonistA knew that the other ponies were watching ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could feel their judgmental eyes on ProtagonistA 
 It was like they were all saying ,  What are ProtagonistA doing ? ProtagonistA 're the only one here 
 ProtagonistA tried to ignore the feeling and focus on what ProtagonistA was supposed to be doing 
 ProtagonistA had a job to do , and ProtagonistA was going to do it to the best of ProtagonistA's ability 
 ProtagonistA was the groundskeeper , and it was ProtagonistA's job to make sure that the grounds were kept up 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and got to work 
 ProtagonistA worked all day , and by the time ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistA was exhausted 
 But ProtagonistA felt good about what ProtagonistA had accomplished 
 ProtagonistA had done ProtagonistA's job well , and ProtagonistA had made the grounds look beautiful 
 ProtagonistA was proud of ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA walked back to the barn , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit sad 
 ProtagonistA wished that ProtagonistA had someone to talk to , someone who would understand what ProtagonistA was going through 
 But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was the only one who felt that way 
 ProtagonistA was the only pony on the grounds , and ProtagonistA would always be alone 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day 
 First , ProtagonistA woke up late and had to rush to get ready for ProtagonistA's day 
 Then , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had forgotten to put on ProtagonistA's shoes and had to go back to ProtagonistA's room to find them 
 When ProtagonistA finally made it downstairs , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's keys upstairs 
 So , ProtagonistA had to go back up to get them 
 By the time ProtagonistA made it out the door , ProtagonistA was already running late 
 ProtagonistA rushed to ProtagonistA's car , but when ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had locked ProtagonistA's keys in the house 
 ProtagonistA did n't have time to go back , so ProtagonistA had to call ProtagonistB 
 By the time ProtagonistB arrived , ProtagonistA was so frazzled , ProtagonistA forgot to pay ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA finally made it to work , but ProtagonistA's boss was not happy 
 ProtagonistA sat at ProtagonistA's desk , trying to concentrate on ProtagonistA's work , but ProtagonistA was so distracted , ProtagonistA could n't focus 
 ProtagonistA , are ProtagonistA okay?Bob turned to see ProtagonistA's co - worker , Concerned 
  ProtagonistA 'm fine ,  ProtagonistA lied 
 ProtagonistA do n't look fine 
 ProtagonistA look like ProtagonistA 're about to have a breakdown 
 But ProtagonistA was n't fine 
 ProtagonistA was about to lose ProtagonistA's job , ProtagonistA had no money to pay ProtagonistA's rent , and ProtagonistA was pretty sure ProtagonistA's girlfriend was about to break up with ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA sat there , staring at ProtagonistA's computer screen , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's keys at home again 
 ProtagonistA was having the worst day ever 
ProtagonistA had only once thought ProtagonistA would have a family , but now ProtagonistA believed that it was n't such a bad idea 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner and never really saw the appeal in having a wife and kids 
 But now , as ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistA's mid-30s , ProtagonistA started to feel like something was missing in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA began to think that maybe a family would be a good thing after all 
 So , ProtagonistA started the process of finding a wife 
 Then , one day , ProtagonistA met a woman named Sarah and everything clicked 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe how happy ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA had finally found ProtagonistA's place in the world and ProtagonistA loved it 
ProtagonistA was a small dog who loved to sit on ProtagonistA's hind legs and watch the sun set 
 ProtagonistA loved the large ship ProtagonistA was on and the way the sun set on the horizon 
ProtagonistA had been having a great day 
 ProtagonistA had just finished up at work and was looking forward to a relaxing evening at home 
 But when ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's front door , ProtagonistA froze 
 ProtagonistA was about to turn and run when ProtagonistB spoke 
  ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to go with ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was afraid of what would happen if ProtagonistA did n't 
 So ProtagonistA reluctantly followed ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA was led away 
ProtagonistA had been working at the same company for ProtagonistA's entire adult life 
 ProtagonistA had started out as a lowly intern and worked ProtagonistA's way up to the position of CEO 
 ProtagonistA had been at the company for so long that ProtagonistA was starting to feel like a part of the furniture 
 But ProtagonistA was starting to feel like maybe it was time for a change 
 ProtagonistA had been thinking about retiring , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA was ready to give up the work that ProtagonistA loved 
 ProtagonistA had also been considering starting ProtagonistA's own company , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA had the energy or the resources to make it happen 
 One day , ProtagonistA came into work and found that ProtagonistA's office had been cleared out 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe that after all these years , ProtagonistA was being let go 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do next , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA needed to start looking for a new job 
 As ProtagonistA was leaving the office , ProtagonistA ran into one of ProtagonistA's old friends from the company 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe that ProtagonistA's life was being turned upside down 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going to go or what ProtagonistA was going to do , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA needed to start over 
ProtagonistA was lying on ProtagonistA's back , gazing up into the sky 
 ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and calm wash over ProtagonistA 
 For a moment , ProtagonistA forgot all about ProtagonistA's problems and just enjoyed the simple beauty of the world around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a horse , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was n't supposed to be in the library , but ProtagonistA could n't help it 
 ProtagonistA had been coming to the library for years , and no one had ever caught ProtagonistA 
 Tonight , ProtagonistA was feeling particularly restless 
 ProtagonistA had just finished reading all of the books in ProtagonistA's stall , and ProtagonistA was looking for something new to read 
 ProtagonistA had been to the library many times before , but ProtagonistA had never actually been inside 
 ProtagonistA had always been too afraid of getting caught 
 But tonight , ProtagonistA was feeling brave 
 ProtagonistA was going to go inside the library and find a new book to read 
 ProtagonistA stepped into the library and looked around 
 ProtagonistA saw the rows of books and the tables where people were studying 
 ProtagonistA saw the librarian at the front desk , and ProtagonistA froze 
 ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA was going to get caught 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart fill with joy as ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was welcome in the library 
 ProtagonistA walked over to the nearest shelf and started to browse the titles 
 ProtagonistA had never felt so welcome anywhere before 
ProtagonistA stretched out ProtagonistA's forelegs , rested the hind legs on the side of ProtagonistA's neck , and looked around 
 ProtagonistA was a frog , and ProtagonistA loved the swamp 
 ProtagonistA loved the way the water lilies smelled , and the way the turtles sunned themselves on the logs 
 ProtagonistA even liked the snakes , though ProtagonistA knew they were dangerous 
 ProtagonistA was about to hop off ProtagonistA's log and go explore when ProtagonistA saw a movement out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye 
 It was a human ! ProtagonistA had never seen a human before , but ProtagonistA had heard the other animals talk about them 
 ProtagonistA just felt curious 
 ProtagonistA hopped closer to the human to get a better look 
ProtagonistA looked around the vast plain of the agricultural landscape that surrounded ProtagonistA's castle 
 ProtagonistA had been ruling over this kingdom for years , and it had been a peaceful and prosperous time 
 ProtagonistA could see the army of the neighboring kingdom , advancing towards ProtagonistA's castle 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would have to defend ProtagonistA's kingdom , and ProtagonistA was ready to do whatever it took 
ProtagonistA stood and watched ProtagonistA's sister Dash ProtagonistB float by 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could join ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to stay on the bank and watch ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had spent the day trying to convince ProtagonistA's friend to let ProtagonistA's ride to the Everfree 
 ProtagonistA had been talking about it for weeks and was finally able to convince ProtagonistA's friend to come along 
 ProtagonistA was excited to finally be able to see the Everfree and all of the magical creatures that lived there 
 ProtagonistA was sure that they would see some amazing things on this trip 
 ProtagonistA was sure that they were going to see something amazing 
 ProtagonistA turned around to see a large , furry creature standing in front of them 
 ProtagonistA's friend was terrified , but ProtagonistA was still excited 
 ProtagonistA was sure that they had found something amazing 
 ProtagonistA had been bugging ProtagonistB for weeks to come over and hang out , and ProtagonistB had been putting it off 
 But ProtagonistA was insistent , and ProtagonistB finally relented 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately , and ProtagonistB had been meaning to reach out to ProtagonistA but just had n't gotten around to it 
 When ProtagonistB got there , ProtagonistA was thrilled to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistB was persistent 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA relented and agreed to come over to ProtagonistB's house 
When ProtagonistA woke in the morning , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in the middle of a grand , wide , open airship 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to see that there were no walls or ceilings , just a vast expanse of sky in every direction 
 ProtagonistA got up and walked to the edge of the airship , and looked down 
 Far below , ProtagonistA could see the ground , and tiny people and cars moving about 
 ProtagonistA was so high up that they looked like ants 
 ProtagonistA felt a tap on ProtagonistA's shoulder , and turned around to see a friendly - looking man in a pilot 's uniform 
 ProtagonistA thanked the pilot and went to find a seat 
 ProtagonistA was excited to see where this journey would take ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was a princess and ProtagonistA was not going anywhere 
 ProtagonistA was content to stay in ProtagonistA's castle , surrounded by ProtagonistA's loyal subjects 
 ProtagonistA was happy to know that ProtagonistA had saved ProtagonistA's kingdom and would always be remembered as a hero 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA felt a little bit sad , but ProtagonistA was also excited for the night ahead 
 ProtagonistA knew that there were many adventures to be had under the stars 
ProtagonistA was standing there , wondering how to explain ProtagonistA's pregnancy without sounding like an idiot 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be home soon , and ProtagonistA did n't want to have to explain why ProtagonistA was pregnant 
 ProtagonistA had been trying to keep it a secret from ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would eventually find out 
 ProtagonistA was just hoping that ProtagonistB would be understanding 
 When ProtagonistB walked in , ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was not happy 
 ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA had been wondering how to explain ProtagonistA's pregnancy without sounding like an idiot , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to tell ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was sorry for not being honest with ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was scared of ProtagonistB's reaction 
ProtagonistA had ruptured ProtagonistA's ACL playing football with ProtagonistA's friends and was now facing a long road to recovery 
 ProtagonistA was lucky that ProtagonistB was there to help ProtagonistA through it 
 Now , ProtagonistA was facing another challenge , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be there for ProtagonistA every step of the way 
Now , said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA sat down in ProtagonistA's chair , ProtagonistA want to tell you a story 
ProtagonistA sat in the back seat of ProtagonistA's pink and white pony wagon and watched the clouds drift away 
 ProtagonistA loved the way they looked like fluffy cotton candy 
 ProtagonistA was content to just sit back and enjoy the ride 
 ProtagonistA loved spending time with ProtagonistA's family and being outdoors 
ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and sent a gentle , sinking beam of red light across the smooth white ground 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and smiled 
 ProtagonistA loved this time of day 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned and saw a giant creature , standing on two legs and towering over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA could hear the creature 's footsteps pounding the ground behind ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was n't going to make it 
 ProtagonistA was about to be eaten by a giant monster!Just as the creature was about to catch ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA felt something grab ProtagonistA and pull ProtagonistA out of the way 
 ProtagonistA looked up and saw that ProtagonistA was now floating in the air , held up by a large bird 
 ProtagonistA was safe , and ProtagonistA had the bird to thank for it 
ProtagonistA was laughing so hard ProtagonistA seemed to think ProtagonistA was dead 
 ProtagonistA had never laughed so hard in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA was going to die from laughter 
ProtagonistA had been walking through the desert for days , ProtagonistA's water supply running low 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up hope when ProtagonistA saw a small oasis in the distance 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting in the shade of a palm tree 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could handle anything that came ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA was a strong man , and ProtagonistA was proud of that 
 ProtagonistA had always been able to take care of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was never afraid of anything 
ProtagonistA stood with ProtagonistA's hooves on the other side of the barrier , watching the ponies through the small crack in the glass 
 ProtagonistA had tried to shrink ProtagonistA down , but it never worked 
 One day , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA would stand on the other side of the barrier and watch ProtagonistB's play with the other ponies 
 ProtagonistA asked the other ponies what had happened to ProtagonistB , but they would n't tell ProtagonistA 
 A few weeks later , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB again 
ProtagonistA lay awake overnight , dreaming of a new day in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA dreamed of a new life , full of possibilities 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA felt refreshed and excited for the new day ahead 
ProtagonistA stood in front of the camera , ProtagonistA's eyes bluish as a heart 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a red shirt and black pants 
 ProtagonistA looked into the camera and smiled 
  ProtagonistA took a step back and began to take pictures of the people in the room 
 ProtagonistA took pictures of them smiling , laughing , and talking 
 ProtagonistA took pictures of them in groups and alone 
 ProtagonistA took pictures of them with their families and with their friends 
 ProtagonistA took pictures of them at work and at play 
 ProtagonistA took pictures of them in their homes and in their cars 
 ProtagonistA took pictures of them in their clothes and in their beds 
 ProtagonistA took pictures of them in their lives and in their deaths 
ProtagonistA had been behind the wheel of the truck for nearly two hours and most of that time ProtagonistA did n't even care what the heck was happening around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was just trying to get to ProtagonistA's destination as quickly as possible 
 But then , as ProtagonistA was about to enter the city , ProtagonistA noticed a commotion on the side of the road 
 ProtagonistA decided to see what was going on 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that the group was gathered around a dog that had been hit by a car 
 ProtagonistA felt terrible 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't just leave the dog there to suffer 
 ProtagonistA pulled over and got out of the truck 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had to do something 
 ProtagonistA could n't just let the dog die 
 So , ProtagonistA scooped it up into ProtagonistA's arms and took it to the vet ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was doing the right thing 
 ProtagonistA was so relieved 
 ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA was able to help , even if it was just a small thing 
 ProtagonistA had been listening to ProtagonistB's story for hours , and ProtagonistA still had so many questions 
 But ProtagonistA could n't bear to end ProtagonistB's story without telling ProtagonistB of the man who had saved ProtagonistB's life and placed ProtagonistB in the care of ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was well known in the world for ProtagonistA's literary talent and for ProtagonistA's indomitable resolution 
ProtagonistA had spent the majority of ProtagonistA's life as a woman 
 But as ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA started to feel like something was off 
 ProtagonistA could n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA did n't feel like a woman anymore 
 ProtagonistA started to experiment with ProtagonistA's appearance and soon realized that ProtagonistA was actually a man 
 ProtagonistA changed ProtagonistA's name , ProtagonistA's pronouns , and started living ProtagonistA's life as the man ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was 
ProtagonistA rested ProtagonistA's forelegs on ProtagonistA's elbows and let out a deep breath 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let ProtagonistA's mind wander 
 ProtagonistA thought about all the things ProtagonistA had to do tomorrow and sighed 
 ProtagonistA was so tired and just wanted to sleep 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw ProtagonistB standing in the shadows 
 ProtagonistA felt bad for ProtagonistB and wanted to help 
 ProtagonistA stood up and walked over to ProtagonistB 
  Are ProtagonistB okay ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say , but ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA needed to say something 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA nodded and said ,  If ProtagonistB need anything , just let ProtagonistA know 
  Then ProtagonistA turned and walked away 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and dreamed of a new world 
 ProtagonistA would have a huge palace , and the best food and clothes 
 ProtagonistA would be the most powerful man in the world , and everyone would fear ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 'm getting in bed with you ,  ProtagonistA said , sliding under the sheets 
  ProtagonistA do n't know , ProtagonistA just felt like it ,  ProtagonistA said 
  But ProtagonistA have to be careful , ProtagonistA might squish Eeyore 
   ProtagonistA 'll be careful ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes 
 ProtagonistA 'd never been bad in ProtagonistA's life , had ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistA 'd always been a sponge 
 But ProtagonistA was out of cupcakes and ProtagonistA needed more 
 ProtagonistA needed to be bad 
 ProtagonistA needed to do something naughty 
 ProtagonistA started by stealing a cupcake from the bakery down the street 
 like ProtagonistA was finally doing something for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't feel guilty about it , not one bit 
 ProtagonistA started breaking into people 's homes and stealing their things 
 ProtagonistA vandalized property and got into fights 
 ProtagonistA was finally living ProtagonistA's life on ProtagonistA's own terms and it felt good 
 As ProtagonistA sat in ProtagonistA's cell , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA 'd finally hit rock bottom 
 ProtagonistA had no one to blame but ProtagonistA 
 But even in ProtagonistA's darkest moment , ProtagonistA still could n't help but crave a cupcake 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a pessimist , but ProtagonistA did n't think ProtagonistA's life would end so soon 
 ProtagonistA was only in ProtagonistA's early 60s , after all 
 But when ProtagonistA woke up on the second day of August , ProtagonistA just knew that ProtagonistA's time was up 
 ProtagonistA could n't explain it , but ProtagonistA could feel it in ProtagonistA's bones 
 ProtagonistA decided to spend ProtagonistA's last day doing all the things ProtagonistA loved 
 ProtagonistA went for a long walk in the park , ate ProtagonistA's favorite foods , and called up all ProtagonistA's friends and family to say goodbye 
 ProtagonistA knew it would be hard for them , but ProtagonistA wanted them to know that ProtagonistA was at peace with ProtagonistA's decision 
 As the sun set , ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's porch , watching the world go by 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would be leaving it soon , but ProtagonistA was content knowing that ProtagonistA had lived a good life 
ProtagonistA looked rather like a bimbos older or younger than ProtagonistA had been when ProtagonistA first met ProtagonistB for the first time , considering the circumstances 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot since then , and it showed in the lines on ProtagonistA's face and the gray in ProtagonistA's hair 
ProtagonistA was far away , so distant that it was hard to remember when ProtagonistA had come 
 But one day , out of the blue , ProtagonistA showed up at their doorstep 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot during ProtagonistA's time away , but ProtagonistA was finally home where ProtagonistA belonged 
ProtagonistA had never been to a Princess party before , and ProtagonistA loved the idea of it 
 ProtagonistA loved the idea of getting all dressed up in a princess gown and getting ProtagonistA's picture taken with all of the other little princesses 
 When ProtagonistA got to the party , ProtagonistA was so excited to see all of the other little girls in their princess gowns 
ProtagonistA had been travelling west , but ProtagonistA's eyes had been paid to the south , where the sun shone and the air was still and fragrant , the colour of wheat or millet 
 ProtagonistA had been on the road for weeks , and ProtagonistA's supplies were running low 
 ProtagonistA was getting desperate 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across a small farmhouse in the middle of nowhere 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door , but there was no answer 
 ProtagonistA peered in the window and saw ProtagonistB inside , sitting in a rocking chair 
 ProtagonistA called out to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB did n't respond 
 ProtagonistA tried the door , but it was locked 
 ProtagonistA knocked again , harder this time 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB had any food , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB did n't have much , but ProtagonistB could give ProtagonistA some of ProtagonistB's husband 's old clothes 
 ProtagonistA was grateful for the clothes and ProtagonistB's kindness 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB needed anything , but ProtagonistB just shook ProtagonistB's head and told ProtagonistA to be on ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA continued on ProtagonistA's journey , but ProtagonistA could n't get ProtagonistB out of ProtagonistA's mind 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could have done more for ProtagonistB 
 A few days later , ProtagonistA came across a group of travellers 
 As they travelled , ProtagonistA told them about ProtagonistB and how ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could have helped ProtagonistB more 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends had just finished taking a trip with Rarity when they decided to go on a camping trip 
 ProtagonistA just nodded ProtagonistA's head in response , not really sure what to say 
 And yet , here ProtagonistA was , about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to travel the world , and now ProtagonistA finally had the chance 
 ProtagonistA was going to be a part of a travelling circus , and ProtagonistA could not be more excited 
 And now , here ProtagonistA was , about to make them come true 
 ProtagonistA hugged ProtagonistB tightly , promising to come back and visit ProtagonistB as often as ProtagonistA could 
 Then , with a final wave , ProtagonistA was off , ready to start the adventure of a lifetime 
 ProtagonistA had been to the best party ever and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA had made some great new friends 
 ProtagonistA could n't wait to get back to the party and continue the fun 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA could hear the water moving up from the lake 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and blistered 
 ProtagonistA was thirsty , and the water looked so inviting 
 ProtagonistA walked to the edge of the lake and knelt down 
 ProtagonistA cupped ProtagonistA's hands and brought the water to ProtagonistA's lips 
 Just as ProtagonistA was about to drink , ProtagonistA heard a noise behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw a bear standing there , looking at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so startled that ProtagonistA fell into the lake 
 ProtagonistA was one of the lucky ones who was able to settle down in a secluded laird 's house 
 ProtagonistA was able to enjoy the beauty and peace of the island 
 Finally , ProtagonistA gave up and walked over to ProtagonistB , nuzzling ProtagonistA's nose in ProtagonistB's direction 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the rocking chair , ProtagonistB's hooves beneath ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA looked out at the sunset , thinking about all the things that had happened in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA 'd been through a lot , but ProtagonistA was still here , still fighting 
 ProtagonistA was grateful for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that as long as ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA could make it through anything 
ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's wings for four years when ProtagonistA discovered that ProtagonistA was pregnant 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how it had happened , but ProtagonistA was sure that it was a mistake 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to be a father , not yet 
 ProtagonistA was still too young and too irresponsible 
 ProtagonistA considered getting an abortion , but ProtagonistA could n't bring ProtagonistA to do it 
 ProtagonistA knew that it would be the right thing to do , but ProtagonistA just could n't bring ProtagonistA to do it 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to kill ProtagonistB 
 Instead , ProtagonistA decided to keep ProtagonistB and raise ProtagonistB on ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA knew it would be hard , but ProtagonistA was determined to do it 
 ProtagonistA would make it work , somehow 
 ProtagonistA had been worried about being a father , but it turned out that ProtagonistA was a natural 
 ProtagonistA was patient and kind , and ProtagonistA always knew just what to do 
 ProtagonistA was everything that ProtagonistB needed , and ProtagonistB thrived under ProtagonistA's care 
 ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA had made the decision to keep ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had been wandering the land for years at that point , but it was the first time that ProtagonistA had really felt comfortable 
 ProtagonistA had finally found a place where ProtagonistA belonged 
 ProtagonistA had found a home 
When ProtagonistA had reached the age of six years old , ProtagonistA began to change into the great doll , who ProtagonistA was always about 
 ProtagonistA would sit for hours in front of the mirror , combing ProtagonistA's hair and straightening ProtagonistA's clothes 
 But ProtagonistA would just smile and continue talking to the doll 
 ProtagonistA was talking to them in a soft voice , as if ProtagonistA was telling them a secret 
 When ProtagonistB asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was doing , ProtagonistA just smiled and said ,  ProtagonistA 'm becoming the great doll 
  And from that day on , ProtagonistA was never the same again 
 ProtagonistA felt a little dizzy 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had seen the fire in the distance 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where to go or what to do 
 ProtagonistA just kept walking , until ProtagonistA could n't walk any further 
 ProtagonistA collapsed to the ground and wept 
ProtagonistA was a simple farm horse who loved nothing more than a good roll in the mud and a carrot or two 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life until one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 From the moment ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was in trouble 
 ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistA's heart racing as ProtagonistA looked into ProtagonistB's eyes 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was in for the ride of ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA rested ProtagonistA's forelegs on ProtagonistA's knees , and let out a deep breath 
 ProtagonistA had been out chasing rabbits all day , and had finally caught one 
 ProtagonistA was proud of ProtagonistA's catch , and was looking forward to a good meal 
 As ProtagonistA rested , ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was happy living in the forest , and did n't want for anything 
 ProtagonistA was content to chase rabbits all day , and sleep in the trees at night 
 ProtagonistA knew that some day ProtagonistA would die in the forest , but ProtagonistA was okay with that 
 It was the cycle of life , and ProtagonistA was happy to be a part of it 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the field of our estate , looking at a photograph of ProtagonistB , with the utmost circumstance of safety 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about how much had changed since ProtagonistB had passed away 
 Now , ProtagonistA was all alone 
 ProtagonistA sighed and put the photograph away , getting to ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistA dusted off ProtagonistA's trousers and decided to go for a walk 
 As ProtagonistA wandered through the estate , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a pang of sadness at all the memories that were now hidden away in the past 
ProtagonistA sat on ProtagonistA's haunches and looked out over the moon 
 ProtagonistA 'd just finished a big project at work and was looking forward to a well - deserved vacation 
 ProtagonistA was going to spend a week at ProtagonistA's cabin in the woods , and ProtagonistA could n't wait to get away from it all 
 As ProtagonistA sat there looking at the moon , ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace come over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was ready for a break , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would enjoy every minute of it 
ProtagonistA looked over the map and saw more animals than ProtagonistA's own family 
 ProtagonistA looked out onto the world and saw that there were so many different types of animals 
 ProtagonistA saw that there were more animals in the world than ProtagonistA's own family 
ProtagonistA was a simple man who lived in a small town in northern Syria 
 ProtagonistA was content to while away ProtagonistA's years in the company of ProtagonistA's friends and family , providing for the needs of ProtagonistA's people 
 ProtagonistA fought bravely , but ultimately ProtagonistA's town was destroyed and ProtagonistA's people were scattered 
 ProtagonistA was the only one left 
 ProtagonistA wandered the countryside , searching for any sign of ProtagonistA's former life 
 But all ProtagonistA found was death and destruction 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA came to accept that ProtagonistA's home and ProtagonistA's people were gone forever 
 ProtagonistA settled down in a new town and started a new life , but ProtagonistA never forgot the loss of ProtagonistA's old one 
ProtagonistA had always been a go - getter 
 ProtagonistA was always the one to start new projects and get things done 
 But lately , ProtagonistA 'd been feeling like something was missing 
 ProtagonistA could n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to make a change 
 ProtagonistA was always so busy with work and other things that ProtagonistA never stopped to think about what ProtagonistA really wanted in life 
 But when ProtagonistA turned 40 , ProtagonistA started to reassess ProtagonistA's life and what ProtagonistA really wanted to do with it 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA wanted to slow down and enjoy life more 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to be constantly chasing after new goals and projects 
 ProtagonistA wanted to focus on the things that really mattered to ProtagonistA and spend more time with the people ProtagonistA loved 
 ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's high - pressure job and started spending more time with ProtagonistA's family and friends 
 ProtagonistA took up hobbies that ProtagonistA enjoyed and started living life on ProtagonistA's own terms 
ProtagonistA had been living in the forest for years , ever since ProtagonistA ran away from home 
 ProtagonistA had no idea what had happened to the kingdom ProtagonistA left behind and ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA was content living in the forest , among the animals 
 But one day , a deer ProtagonistA was friends with told ProtagonistA that the kingdom was in trouble and ProtagonistA was needed 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to go back , but ProtagonistA could n't just ignore ProtagonistA's friends plea 
 So , ProtagonistA reluctantly agreed to go on a journey back to the kingdom 
 ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the great grave , ignorant of all the history of the kingdom 
 ProtagonistA had no intention of ever going back 
 But as ProtagonistA looked at the kingdom before ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had to go back 
 ProtagonistA could n't just leave ProtagonistA's friends and the kingdom ProtagonistA once loved 
 So , ProtagonistA stood up and began ProtagonistA's journey back to the kingdom 
ProtagonistA was so much more beautiful than I thought ProtagonistA was that ProtagonistA was going to kill me 
 ProtagonistA was tall and muscular , with piercing blue eyes and a perfect smile 
 One day , ProtagonistA came up to me and asked me to go for a walk with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so strong and fast that I could n't defend myself 
 ProtagonistA hit me and kicked me , and I was sure ProtagonistA was going to kill me 
 But then , just as suddenly as ProtagonistA had attacked me , ProtagonistA stopped 
 ProtagonistA looked at me , and I could see the humanity in ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA let me go , and I ran away as fast as I could 
 ProtagonistA was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen , and ProtagonistA almost killed me 
ProtagonistA sat on the grass , ProtagonistA's wings spread , ProtagonistA's ears perked up as ProtagonistA listened to the rustle of leaves outside ProtagonistA's window 
 ProtagonistA loved the sound of the leaves rustling in the wind and ProtagonistA always felt so peaceful when ProtagonistA sat and listened to it 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let the peacefulness wash over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was in a coma 
 ProtagonistA is a wealthy man , and I know that ProtagonistA can help me 
 ProtagonistA looks at me with pity and gives me a few coins 
 ProtagonistA would just have to find ProtagonistA's own way to relax 
 When they died , ProtagonistA was the only one left 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to sell the house , but ProtagonistA could n't keep it up by ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA would come by every now and then to check on it , but it was just too much for ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA got a call from ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was surprised , but happy 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping to sell it for years 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB to go ahead and finalize the sale 
 The next day , ProtagonistA went to the house to sign the papers 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to see that the new owners were a young couple with a child 
 ProtagonistA was happy to see that the house was going to a good family 
 ProtagonistA said goodbye and went on ProtagonistA's way 
ProtagonistA had been a human being for as long as ProtagonistA could remember 
 ProtagonistA had appeared on the banks of the river as a human being , and in reality , ProtagonistA was a human being 
 ProtagonistA had been a man , and had been of every human class 
 ProtagonistA had been of every human race , and had been of one or another kind of body 
 ProtagonistA had possessed more or less of two or three kinds of intelligence , and had been distinguished from ProtagonistA's fellows by some characteristic qualities peculiar to the particular kind of river , or stream , or other watercourse , or channel , or channel by which it was obtained 
 ProtagonistA had been , however , the object of abhorrent or even loathsome detestable treatment 
 ProtagonistA had been unwilling either to help the persecutors or to defend ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been willing to do anything to prevent ProtagonistA's persecutors from killing , or setting out to kill , ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had believed ProtagonistA to be innocent , and no less a judge or magistrate than a criminal had charged ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the edge of a tarpaulin in a crowded room with the windows down when the voice whispered in ProtagonistA's ear 
  ProtagonistA turned to see who had spoken to ProtagonistA , but there was no one there 
 ProtagonistA turned back to the tarpaulin and continued to sit 
 ProtagonistA had a lot on ProtagonistA's mind and was deep in thought 
 ProtagonistA did n't see the car coming until it was too late 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was the only unicorn 
 ProtagonistA had never seen another one like ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA was the only one in the world 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to finally meet another unicorn 
ProtagonistA had never known ProtagonistA's father did n't like ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA always thought ProtagonistA's father loved ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was always critical of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA tried ProtagonistA's best to please ProtagonistA's father , but it was never enough 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost the one person who loved ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner 
 ProtagonistA never really felt like ProtagonistA fit in anywhere 
 ProtagonistA should have known something was wrong when ProtagonistB started making strange comments about wanting to kill people 
 But ProtagonistA did n't want to believe that ProtagonistB could be so dark and twisted 
 Sadly , ProtagonistA was wrong 
 ProtagonistA was only able to survive by pure luck , and ProtagonistA was left with some serious injuries 
 ProtagonistA was finally able to see ProtagonistB for the monster that ProtagonistB was 
ProtagonistA had heard the talk of a great city , but ProtagonistA had never seen any of it 
 ProtagonistA had always been content with ProtagonistA's small town life , but when ProtagonistA retired , ProtagonistA decided to finally take a trip to see the city for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was amazed by the sights and sounds of the city , and ProtagonistA even found ProtagonistA a new hobby - people watching 
 ProtagonistA would spend hours sitting in the park , observing the endless stream of people going by 
 It was a great way to spend ProtagonistA's retirement , and ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA finally got to see the city ProtagonistA had always heard so much about 
ProtagonistA had been in a coma for three months , ever since the car accident 
 But on the day of the funeral , ProtagonistA suddenly woke up 
 ProtagonistA could not remember anything about ProtagonistA's life before the accident 
 ProtagonistA did not know who ProtagonistA was or where ProtagonistA came from 
 But ProtagonistA was determined to find out 
 With the help of ProtagonistA's family and friends , ProtagonistA slowly began to piece together ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider 
 ProtagonistA was never quite sure why , but it seemed like ProtagonistA was always on the outside looking in when it came to social gatherings 
 So , when ProtagonistA was invited to a party at the age of fourteen , ProtagonistA was beyond excited 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA finally belonged somewhere 
 ProtagonistA laughed and danced and talked with everyone there and had the time of ProtagonistA's life 
 When the party was over , ProtagonistA went home with a feeling of happiness and belonging 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had finally found ProtagonistA's place in the world 
And tearing Bob 's father 's arm off , ProtagonistA did not spring a foot 
ProtagonistA had been taking the ferry down to the harbor every day for years 
 ProtagonistA knew every twist and turn of the winding stone steps 
 As ProtagonistA took the ferry down the steps , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB lying at the bottom 
  ProtagonistA ca n't leave ProtagonistB here 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anyone like ProtagonistB before 
 ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA should help ProtagonistB or not 
 Finally , ProtagonistA made up ProtagonistA's mind 
 ProtagonistA would help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA went down to ProtagonistB and tried to lift ProtagonistB up , but ProtagonistB was too heavy 
 ProtagonistA could n't do it by ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA shouted for help , but no one came 
 Finally , ProtagonistA saw a group of men coming down the steps 
 ProtagonistA think ProtagonistB 's hurt ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA never saw ProtagonistB again , but ProtagonistA always wondered what happened to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had seen a lot of death in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA 'd been a soldier for years , and ProtagonistA 'd seen ProtagonistA's friends die in battle 
 And the worst part was , ProtagonistA was powerless to stop it 
 ProtagonistA watched , frozen in horror , as the man was killed 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA felt sick to ProtagonistA's stomach , and ProtagonistA wanted to vomit 
 But ProtagonistA forced ProtagonistA to stay calm 
 ProtagonistA had to think 
ProtagonistA was a man of the people , and at the time that ProtagonistA was travelling so very far , that ProtagonistA was not aware of its importance 
 ProtagonistA was on a journey to find ProtagonistA , and in doing so , ProtagonistA found something much greater 
 ProtagonistA found a purpose 
 ProtagonistA found a reason to keep going , even when the going got tough 
 ProtagonistA found love 
 ProtagonistA has been a model prisoner since ProtagonistA's last release , and the warden has been lenient with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA does not protest or beg for mercy , ProtagonistA simply accepts ProtagonistA's fate 
 As ProtagonistA is led to the execution chamber , ProtagonistA thinks about ProtagonistA's life and all of the times ProtagonistA has been in prison 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider 
 ProtagonistA was never quite sure why , but ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA did n't quite fit in with the other kids at school 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit taller and lankier than the other kids ProtagonistA's age and ProtagonistA had always been a bit more mature , as if ProtagonistA was carrying the weight of the world on ProtagonistA's shoulders 
 But by the time ProtagonistA reached ProtagonistA's limits , ProtagonistA was an ordinary young man - not quite fourteen , but in the right sort of body 
 ProtagonistA had finally started to fill out and ProtagonistA was beginning to look like the man ProtagonistA would one day become 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a dreamer and ProtagonistA had always had big plans for ProtagonistA's future 
 ProtagonistA wanted to travel the world and see all the amazing things it had to offer 
 ProtagonistA wanted to make a difference in the world and help people who were less fortunate than ProtagonistA was 
 And ProtagonistA wanted to find the love of ProtagonistA's life and settle down 
 But by the time ProtagonistA reached ProtagonistA's limits , ProtagonistA was beginning to realize that ProtagonistA's dreams might never come true 
 ProtagonistA had a dead - end job and ProtagonistA was stuck in a cycle of poverty that ProtagonistA could never seem to break out of 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an optimist , but by the time ProtagonistA reached ProtagonistA's limits , ProtagonistA was starting to feel like a failure 
 ProtagonistA had always thought that ProtagonistA would amount to something , but now ProtagonistA was just an ordinary young man with no prospects and no future 
In the year 1838 , ProtagonistA published ProtagonistA's scientific treatise , entitled , Energetic Forces and Energy , in which ProtagonistA distinguishes between the forms of energy , invisible to the senses , and those which have a definite object , the third and highest form of Energy 
ProtagonistA had been married for years , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB dearly 
 However , lately ProtagonistA had been feeling restless 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to travel and see the world , and now that ProtagonistB was getting older , ProtagonistA felt like it was finally time to do something for ProtagonistA 
 So , one day , ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and left ProtagonistB alone in the garden 
 ProtagonistA went to pick up the newspaper and dipped it into ProtagonistA's cupboard , wishing ProtagonistA had a camera and a memory of where ProtagonistA had put it the week before 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would be heartbroken when ProtagonistA left , but ProtagonistA did n't want to burden ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's wanderlust 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would be better off without ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA drove away from ProtagonistA's home , ProtagonistA felt a mixture of sadness and excitement 
 ProtagonistA was sad to be leaving ProtagonistB behind , but ProtagonistA was also excited to finally be embarking on ProtagonistA's own adventure 
 Who knows what the future holds ? ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA drove into the sunset 
ProtagonistA usually sat at ProtagonistA's desk and wrote in a notebook 
 ProtagonistA was a writer , and ProtagonistA found that writing in a notebook was the best way for ProtagonistA to get ProtagonistA's ideas down 
 Today , however , ProtagonistA was having trouble focusing 
 ProtagonistA kept thinking about the fight ProtagonistA had with ProtagonistB the night before 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to apologize to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was n't sure how to go about it 
  ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said ,  ProtagonistC need to talk to ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA turned to ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistC could see the sadness in ProtagonistA's eyes 
ProtagonistA was a unicorn , and ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's best friend 
 But one day , ProtagonistA betrayed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA said something mean to ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB felt ProtagonistB's heart break 
 ProtagonistA was just a figment of ProtagonistB's imagination 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it 
 ProtagonistA knew in that moment that ProtagonistA was going to dance with ProtagonistB 
 Slowly , ProtagonistA stood up and made ProtagonistA's way across the room 
 ProtagonistA could feel the eyes of the other guests on ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA had never felt so alive 
 ProtagonistA had never felt this way before 
 ProtagonistA could barely find the words to respond 
  It was ProtagonistA's pleasure ,  ProtagonistA managed to say 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget this night 
 ProtagonistA collapsed to the ground , gasping for air as the life drained out of ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA's life ended , ProtagonistA swore ProtagonistA would get revenge on ProtagonistA's killer 
ProtagonistA was never the best sleeper 
 ProtagonistA would always find ProtagonistA tossing and turning throughout the night , never able to get comfortable 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA getting sleepy as they walked and by the time they got back to the flat , ProtagonistA was fast asleep 
 And , finally , after years of struggling , ProtagonistA was able to sleep through the night 
In the days when ProtagonistA tried to forget or suppress all sense of history , ProtagonistA made a point of discussing ProtagonistA's own ministry with ProtagonistA's fellow church members and those whom ProtagonistA met through the temple 
 ProtagonistA was always careful to keep ProtagonistA's stories about ProtagonistA's ministry separate from ProtagonistA's stories about ProtagonistA's personal life 
 This way , ProtagonistA could forget about ProtagonistA's past and focus on the present 
 ProtagonistA hesitated at first , but then ProtagonistA began to open up 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the people ProtagonistA had met and the places ProtagonistA had been 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the good times and the bad times 
 As ProtagonistA spoke , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had been suppressing ProtagonistA's memories for too long 
 ProtagonistA had been trying to forget about ProtagonistA's past , but it was time to face it 
 ProtagonistA would spend hours staring up at the night sky , dreaming of one day seeing one up close 
 So when ProtagonistA saw one streaking across the sky , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to follow it 
 ProtagonistA chartered a boat and set sail down the Thames 
 After a few days of sailing , ProtagonistA spotted the comet in the distance 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could see that it was heading straight for London 
 ProtagonistA called out to the sailors of the Thames , warning them of the comet 
 ProtagonistA did n't care what they thought 
 ProtagonistA knew the comet was going to hit London and ProtagonistA had to warn people 
 ProtagonistA watched in horror as the city was destroyed 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had tried to warn people , but no one would listen 
 As a child , ProtagonistA would watch the magicians in the circus perform their amazing feats and dream of one day being able to do the same 
 So when ProtagonistA was given a magic kit for ProtagonistA's birthday , ProtagonistA was over the moon 
 For weeks , ProtagonistA practised the tricks ProtagonistA had learned from the book that came with the kit 
 But no matter how hard ProtagonistA tried , ProtagonistA just could n't make them work 
 ProtagonistA was beginning to lose hope that ProtagonistA would ever be able to do real magic 
 Glittering with the colors of magic , ProtagonistA blinked widely , as though ProtagonistA were trying to find the light 
 And then , suddenly , ProtagonistA saw it - the light of the magic ProtagonistA had been searching for 
 From that day on , ProtagonistA was a master of magic 
ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was afraid of ghosts 
 ProtagonistA had never seen one , but ProtagonistA had heard stories 
 ProtagonistA would always get so scared and ProtagonistA would never want to sleep alone 
 One night , ProtagonistA was home alone 
 ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's room , trying to sleep , when ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to investigate 
 ProtagonistA did n't see anything , but ProtagonistA could still hear the noise 
 ProtagonistA was so scared that ProtagonistA ran back to ProtagonistA's room and hid under the covers 
 ProtagonistA did n't come out until the sun was up 
 ProtagonistA was sure that there was a ghost in ProtagonistA's house , but ProtagonistA never saw it again 
 ProtagonistA was a simple man , and ProtagonistA did n't really understand the power that ProtagonistA had been given , but ProtagonistA knew that it was important 
 ProtagonistA used ProtagonistA's power to make deals with the other Emperors , and ProtagonistA was always able to get what ProtagonistA wanted 
 ProtagonistA was a great Emperor , and ProtagonistA ruled for many years 
ProtagonistA , in my modest opinion , was walking home in ProtagonistA's own shoes , with ProtagonistA's hat on , from the back of the church , where ProtagonistA had been having the rough passage due to he , and which was 
 ProtagonistA was a bit down in the dumps , but ProtagonistA tried to keep ProtagonistA's chin up 
 ProtagonistA was looking forward to getting home , taking ProtagonistA's shoes off , and putting ProtagonistA's feet up 
 When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA was surprised to see ProtagonistB waiting for ProtagonistA at the door 
 ProtagonistA knew that something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had failed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA broke down in tears and hugged ProtagonistB tightly 
 ProtagonistA was a tall , thin man with a kind face and a quick wit 
 ProtagonistA was always happy to help me with my own dressmaking projects , and I was constantly amazed by ProtagonistA's skill 
 ProtagonistA has truly become one of the most talented and respected dressmakers in the world , and I am so proud to have been ProtagonistA's friend from the very beginning 
 ProtagonistA had been with ProtagonistB in the hospital the night before ProtagonistB passed away , holding ProtagonistB's hand and telling ProtagonistB how much ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB 
 The next morning , ProtagonistA woke up from a dream in which ProtagonistB was still alive and healthy 
 ProtagonistA was so overwhelmed with happiness and relief that ProtagonistA started to cry 
 All will be well , ProtagonistA thought 
 ProtagonistA am free , though ProtagonistA doubt it 
 Oh , ProtagonistA know it 's a bad idea 
 ProtagonistA was at a party once 
 ProtagonistA remembered how out of place ProtagonistA felt , surrounded by the wealthy elite 
 ProtagonistA had been sipping on a glass of wine , when ProtagonistA overheard two men talking 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to get involved , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do something 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB and told ProtagonistB what ProtagonistA had overheard 
 ProtagonistA thought that was the end of it , but ProtagonistA was wrong 
 ProtagonistA knew then that ProtagonistA had to leave the city 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's friend and said goodbye 
 ProtagonistA promised to keep in touch , but ProtagonistA never did 
 ProtagonistA knew it was for the best 
 ProtagonistA had to start a new life , somewhere far away from the danger 
 ProtagonistA , is also having a difficult time 
 ProtagonistA is trying to help ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA is also trying to keep up with ProtagonistA's own studies 
ProtagonistA had always been good at cards 
 ProtagonistA could remember back to when ProtagonistA was just a boy , sitting around the kitchen table with ProtagonistA's brothers and sisters , playing for pennies 
 ProtagonistA had always had a knack for reading people and knowing what cards they were holding 
 As ProtagonistA got older , ProtagonistA started to play for higher stakes 
 ProtagonistA began to travel from town to town , pitting ProtagonistA's skills against anyone who was willing to play ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA quickly gained a reputation as the best card player around 
 One day , ProtagonistA heard about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA set out on ProtagonistA's journey , and after a long and arduous journey , ProtagonistA finally arrived at ProtagonistB's doorstep 
 ProtagonistA had become the world 's best card player , and ProtagonistA had stolen the title from ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was packing ProtagonistA's bag full of pastries , fully aware that ProtagonistA might run into an unusual custom in the future 
 ProtagonistA was also anticipating Croaking to find a new friend to eat with 
  At least ProtagonistA 'm not going to eat them ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA had been on the City - Ship for as long as ProtagonistA could remember 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what was out there , but ProtagonistA knew it was time to find out 
ProtagonistA had been fighting in the war for years 
 ProtagonistA had seen too much death and destruction to count 
 All ProtagonistA wanted was to go home to ProtagonistA's family and finally have some peace 
 ProtagonistA arrived home to a hero 's welcome 
 ProtagonistA started to have nightmares and flashbacks of all the terrible things ProtagonistA had seen 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to eat or leave ProtagonistA's bed 
 ProtagonistA just wanted the pain to go away 
 ProtagonistA finally started to feel like ProtagonistA again 
 Finally , after years of fighting , ProtagonistA was able to find some peace 
ProtagonistA , sitting crosslegged on a damp stone floor , had a cigarette lighter in each hand , and a bundle of twigs in front of ProtagonistA , containing nothing but a wide - brimmed hat and a pair of straw gloves 
 ProtagonistA was trying to light a fire , but the dampness of the twigs made it difficult 
 ProtagonistA had been at it for hours , and ProtagonistA's fingers were starting to cramp 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw a spark catch on one of the twigs 
 ProtagonistA quickly blew on it , and soon a small fire was burning 
 ProtagonistA put the hat and gloves on , and sat back to enjoy the warmth 
Deep within a blue - green void , ProtagonistA was very proud of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was like a proud and very happy man , very pleased with himself 
 In the same way as a proud and very happy man is very happy with himself , ProtagonistA was also very happy with ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been hunting for days , ever since the villagers had snatched ProtagonistB from ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had tracked them to this valley , and now ProtagonistA had found the body of ProtagonistB , lying among the trees and wildflowers 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never be able to bring ProtagonistB back to life , but ProtagonistA could at least give ProtagonistB a proper burial 
ProtagonistA was a man of genius , even when ProtagonistA was young , and one who carried on ProtagonistA's mind without restraint the deep doctrine of national devotion which was then in fashion 
 Even when ProtagonistA was old and infirm , ProtagonistA's mind was still full of the love of ProtagonistA's country , and ProtagonistA died as ProtagonistA had lived , a devoted patriot 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an oddball , and ProtagonistA's eighteenth year was no different 
 ProtagonistA had just finished high school and was eager to start ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was convinced that ProtagonistB was the one for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was determined to make ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's wife 
 ProtagonistA was in for a surprise 
 ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA had made a mistake , but ProtagonistA was not sure how to get out of it 
 ProtagonistA tried to make the best of it , but the honeymoon was a disaster 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had made a mistake , but ProtagonistA was not ready to give up on ProtagonistA's dream of finding the perfect wife 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's third year of college and things were going great 
 ProtagonistA was doing well in ProtagonistA's classes and had a lot of friends 
 ProtagonistA was even dating ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life and did n't see any reason to change anything 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to go to classes or see ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to be alone 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA started to pull ProtagonistA out of ProtagonistA's slump 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistB was n't worth ProtagonistA's time and that ProtagonistA was better off without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA started hanging out with ProtagonistA's friends again and doing better in ProtagonistA's classes 
 ProtagonistA was finally happy again 
 Looking back , ProtagonistA realized that the break - up was the best thing that could have ever happened to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been hoping that ProtagonistA had died in an airplane accident 
 ProtagonistA was tired of ProtagonistA's life and felt like ProtagonistA had nothing to live for 
 ProtagonistA was tired of feeling like a failure and ProtagonistA wanted to end it all 
 So when ProtagonistA heard about the plane crash , ProtagonistA was hoping that ProtagonistA would be one of the victims 
 ProtagonistA was hoping that ProtagonistA's death would be quick and painless and that ProtagonistA's family would be better off without ProtagonistA 
 But when ProtagonistA woke up in the hospital , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was still alive and that ProtagonistA had to face ProtagonistA's problems head on 
 ProtagonistA was going to have to make some changes in ProtagonistA's life if ProtagonistA ever wanted to be happy again 
ProtagonistA had always loved books 
 ProtagonistA loved the way they smelled , the way they felt in ProtagonistA's hands , and the way they took ProtagonistA to places ProtagonistA had never been before 
 When ProtagonistA was thirteen , ProtagonistA started dating ProtagonistA's first book 
 ProtagonistA loved spending time with it , reading it over and over again 
 But eventually ProtagonistA started to doubt whether or not the book was really the right one for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA started to feel like maybe ProtagonistA was too young for it , that it was too complicated for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA started to think that maybe ProtagonistA should find a book that was more ProtagonistA's level 
 But ProtagonistA did n't want to break up with In a Sentence or an Exposition , so ProtagonistA just stopped dating it , stopped reading it , and put it back on the shelf 
In the year of our Lord 2001 , ProtagonistA was sitting in the chair , with ProtagonistA's hat on the mantelpiece , and ProtagonistB next to ProtagonistA , which was a very strange arrangement 
 ProtagonistA was a large man , with a hearty laugh and a jovial disposition 
 ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB , a little taken aback 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say or how to respond 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to kill ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could see the pain and suffering ProtagonistB was in 
 Finally , ProtagonistA nodded 
 Okay , ProtagonistA 'll do it 
 ProtagonistA got up and went to the mantelpiece , where ProtagonistA took down ProtagonistA's hat 
 ProtagonistA walked back to ProtagonistB and put the hat on ProtagonistB's head 
  ProtagonistA 've really done it 
  ProtagonistA had always been the successful one , the one who had made something of ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 've made something of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 're successful 
  ProtagonistA put ProtagonistA's hand on ProtagonistB's shoulder and gave ProtagonistB a reassuring squeeze 
  ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB are ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA know 
 , ProtagonistA , of the year of his coronation , made such a marked contribution to the commercial and military prosperity of the city of London , that , when ProtagonistA departed , ProtagonistA found with what an affection and tenderness of mind and mind alone did ProtagonistA devote ProtagonistA to the administrative and financial affairs of the city , and was so much astonished by the extraordinary extent of the public debt that ProtagonistA waited until ProtagonistA had collected a sufficient sum of money from the public , before ProtagonistA was obliged to admit ProtagonistA's own helplessness and to employ ProtagonistA's entire energies in the pressing business of default during some years of the reign of King Henry I
 ProtagonistA had been in and out of prison for most of ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA did n't want to end up back in there , ProtagonistA had to be smart 
 ProtagonistA had to make sure that ProtagonistA did n't do anything that would get ProtagonistA in trouble , and ProtagonistA had to be careful about who ProtagonistA talked to and what ProtagonistA said 
One minute , ProtagonistA was standing in front of ProtagonistA's desk , examining the file ProtagonistA had been given 
 The next minute , ProtagonistA was on the floor , unconscious 
ProtagonistA had always been a hard worker 
 ProtagonistA started out working in ProtagonistA's father 's horse and carriage business when ProtagonistA was just a boy 
 When ProtagonistA was old enough , ProtagonistA bought ProtagonistA's own horse and carriage and started out on ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA did n't have the money to compete with the other carriage businesses in the city , so ProtagonistA started doing odd jobs for people 
 ProtagonistA would do anything they asked , no matter how dirty or difficult it was 
 ProtagonistA quickly gained a reputation as a reliable and honest worker , and people started recommending ProtagonistA to their friends 
 Before long , ProtagonistA had more work than ProtagonistA could handle 
 ProtagonistA was able to save up enough money to buy a small house in the city , and ProtagonistA started to furnish it with the things ProtagonistA needed 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life and did n't need anything more 
 ProtagonistA was happy just doing ProtagonistA's work and being able to provide for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did as ProtagonistA was told and waited outside the building 
 ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistC into the building and down a long hallway 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a large room with a table in the center 
 ProtagonistA did as ProtagonistA was told and was soon finished 
 ProtagonistA was amazed at how much money ProtagonistA had just counted 
 ProtagonistA had never seen so much money in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was now a rich man , and ProtagonistA knew it would n't be long before ProtagonistA was able to buy ProtagonistA's own horse and carriage business 
ProtagonistA is a man who leads a simple life 
 That is , ProtagonistA does not depend on fortune or gifts of nature for happiness 
 ProtagonistA is content with what ProtagonistA has and does not feel the need for more 
 ProtagonistA is happy with ProtagonistA's lot in life and does not envy those who have more than ProtagonistA does 
 ProtagonistA knows that happiness comes from within and is not dependent on material things 
ProtagonistA had been working at ProtagonistA's job for years , and ProtagonistA had never once been summoned to ProtagonistB's office 
 ProtagonistA always just went in when it was time for ProtagonistA's shift 
 But today , as ProtagonistA stood at ProtagonistA's office door , waiting to be summoned , ProtagonistA noticed that the door was open 
 ProtagonistA slowly pushed it open and peeked inside 
  ProtagonistA sat down , and ProtagonistB continued 
  But why ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA would find another job , and ProtagonistA would never give up 
ProtagonistA had the gall to tell us that ProtagonistA had made an incursion into the kingdom of Henry the Second , and that ProtagonistA had been interested , though ProtagonistA had not been interested in the slightest degree 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had been in ProtagonistB's court , and that ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB 
 When we asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistB was like , ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistB was a tall man , with a long beard , and that ProtagonistB wore a crown 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistC , too , and that ProtagonistC was a beautiful woman 
 When we asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistC was like , ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistC was tall , with long hair , and that ProtagonistC wore a crown , too 
There was no doubt in either the mind of the spectator or the mind of the scientist or the ear of either that ProtagonistA was right when ProtagonistA said that a planet orbits a sun 
 And ProtagonistA had heard it from the scientist himself 
ProtagonistA had been living in the city for a long time , and ProtagonistA knew that the term  send a runner  was more than a little strange to the people who lived there 
 Nevertheless , ProtagonistA made a noticeable effort to be friendly , and ProtagonistA was always ready to help out anyone who needed it 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would be happy to help ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB the name of a good friend of ProtagonistA who was looking for a new runner 
ProtagonistA discovered the existence of the world in a paper which was stuck on the back of ProtagonistB's desk , and which ProtagonistA picked up and read from time to time 
 ProtagonistA had always been a curious person , and so when ProtagonistA saw the paper ProtagonistA was intrigued 
 ProtagonistA read it from front to back , and then back to front again 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe what ProtagonistA was reading 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB about the paper , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had found it in a library 
 ProtagonistA was eager to go to the library and find out more about this new world 
There was ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was no great man , and ProtagonistA had no money 
 ProtagonistA was just a regular guy , working a regular job , and living a regular life 
 ProtagonistA won the lottery 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA had more money than ProtagonistA knew what to do with 
 ProtagonistA was miserable , and ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's old life 
 So ProtagonistA gave away all of ProtagonistA's money , and went back to being a regular guy 
 And ProtagonistA was happy again 
 ProtagonistA agreed to the request , and the two men had a nice chat about the upcoming wedding 
ProtagonistA was always in the kitchen , but ProtagonistA was never out of coffee 
 ProtagonistA was the unofficial coffee maker for the office and ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's job very seriously 
 Every morning , ProtagonistA would brew a pot of coffee and make sure that everyone had a cup 
 ProtagonistA knew all of their preferences and would make each cup just the way they liked it 
 ProtagonistA was always cheerful and would chat with everyone while ProtagonistA worked 
 ProtagonistA was a bit of a coffee snob and only used the best beans 
 ProtagonistA would grind them ProtagonistA and always made sure that the water was the perfect temperature 
 One day , ProtagonistA did n't show up for work 
 ProtagonistA had suffered a heart attack and died 
ProtagonistA was always a curious child 
 When ProtagonistA was twelve years old , ProtagonistA invented the flotilla technique 
 ProtagonistA used this technique to explore the rivers and lakes near ProtagonistA's home 
 ProtagonistA continued to use the flotilla technique to explore the world around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA even used it to cross the Atlantic Ocean 
ProtagonistA was hunting down a rabbit when ProtagonistA heard the awful noise of the gunfight 
 ProtagonistA quickly ran towards the noise to see what was happening 
 When ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA saw two men shooting at each other 
 ProtagonistA yelled at them to stop , but they did n't listen 
 ProtagonistA then ran over and tackled one of the men 
 ProtagonistA helped ProtagonistB up and asked ProtagonistB what was going on 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB would go get help 
 ProtagonistA ran to the nearest town and got the sheriff 
 ProtagonistA told the sheriff what happened and the sheriff went to go help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been in the apartment for a week , and it had seemed like a perfect place to stay 
 But now , as ProtagonistA stood in the hallway , ProtagonistA could hear strange noises coming from the other side of the door 
 ProtagonistA rushed to the door and threw it open , only to find ProtagonistA face to face with a creature from ProtagonistA's nightmare 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to act fast 
 ProtagonistA ran towards the creature and tackled it to the ground 
 The person in the room was able to get away , and ProtagonistA was able to subdue the creature 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what it was , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had saved someone 's life 
ProtagonistA had dropped into the school , not knowing why ProtagonistA was there ; it was as though ProtagonistA 'd been dropped into the middle of nowhere 
 ProtagonistA looked around , confused , until ProtagonistA's eyes landed on a sign that read  Welcome to Middleton High School !  ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief ; ProtagonistA must have gotten lost on ProtagonistA's way here 
 ProtagonistA walked into the building , looking for the office , when ProtagonistA heard a voice call ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB , waving at ProtagonistA from down the hall 
 ProtagonistA wandered around the school , taking in the sights and sounds of high school life ; it was so different from when ProtagonistA was last here 
 ProtagonistA eventually made ProtagonistA's way to the office , where ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA drawn to a display case full of trophies 
 ProtagonistA smiled to ProtagonistA , remembering the days when ProtagonistA was a star athlete here 
 ProtagonistA turned to ProtagonistC , expecting to be scolded for trespassing , but ProtagonistC just smiled and said ,  Welcome back , ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been walking very slow all morning , reaching ProtagonistA's destination in the town of Trafalgar , about eight miles south of Manchester 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA's feet were sore and blistered 
 ProtagonistA was looking forward to sitting down and resting for a while 
 When ProtagonistA finally arrived in Trafalgar , ProtagonistA sat down on a bench in the town square and took off ProtagonistA's shoes and socks 
 ProtagonistA massaged ProtagonistA's feet for a few minutes , then put ProtagonistA's shoes back on and stood up 
 ProtagonistA looked around at the shops and businesses in the square , and noticed a sign in the window of a cafe that said  Help Wanted 
  ProtagonistA went inside and asked about the job 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was interested and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA to start the next day 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have found a job so quickly 
 ProtagonistA is now a happy employee of the cafe , and ProtagonistA enjoys spending ProtagonistA's days chatting with the customers and getting to know the people of Trafalgar 
ProtagonistA was sixteen when ProtagonistA enlisted in the army 
 ProtagonistA was sitting alone in ProtagonistA's room , thinking of ProtagonistA's future after the war 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a doctor , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA would be able to go to medical school after the war 
 ProtagonistA was also thinking about getting married and starting a family 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA was ready for that , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA wanted to spend the rest of ProtagonistA's life with someone 
ProtagonistA was getting anxious 
 ProtagonistA had given ProtagonistB a simple task to do and it was taking longer than expected 
 Finally , ProtagonistA decided to call ProtagonistB to see what was taking so long 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to check in and see how ProtagonistB 're doing with the task ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA do n't want to have to give this task to someone else 
 ProtagonistA hung up the phone and sighed 
 ProtagonistA hoped ProtagonistB would hurry up and finish the task so ProtagonistA could move on to other things 
ProtagonistA's eyeball was still open and ProtagonistA's gaze was wandering , but ProtagonistA was sure there was something under the surface of the water 
 ProtagonistA had been swimming for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had seen the creature jump into the lake 
 ProtagonistA was getting tired , but ProtagonistA had to find it 
 ProtagonistA had to know what it was 
 ProtagonistA grabbed it and pulled it towards ProtagonistA 
 It was the creature ! ProtagonistA stared at it , not knowing what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't know whether to kill it or let it go 
 In the end , ProtagonistA made the decision to let it go 
 ProtagonistA let it swim away , back to the safety of the deep water 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never see it again , but that was for the best 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to be responsible for its death 
ProtagonistA had been married to ProtagonistB for over 20 years 
 Every day , ProtagonistA would come home from work and ProtagonistB would have dinner waiting for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA would stand in the kitchen , looking at the empty oven , and it would hurt ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to move on , but it was so hard 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to do it without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been dating ProtagonistB for a few months and things seemed to be going well 
 ProtagonistA decided to try to win ProtagonistB back 
 ProtagonistA showered ProtagonistB with gifts and flowers , and even wrote ProtagonistB's love letters 
 ProtagonistA should have known it was over when ProtagonistB broke up with ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA was such a fool in the beginning that ProtagonistA just could n't let go 
ProtagonistA never knew Bob 's parents did n't like ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was sitting in the kitchen of ProtagonistA's mother 's house , staring up at the ceiling , where magnificent paintings of the gods held the key to the universe 
 ProtagonistA jumped up , but Bob 's parents just glared at ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA was about to say something , but Bob 's parents interrupted ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 're not welcome in our home 
 ProtagonistA did n't understand why Bob 's parents did n't like ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had always thought they were friends 
 But now ProtagonistA realized that they would never be friends 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA just stood there , looking around 
 Then ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
  Do ProtagonistA want to play with us ?  ProtagonistA nodded , and ProtagonistB took ProtagonistA's hand 
 Soon , ProtagonistA was having fun , too 
 ProtagonistA forgot all about the green hall and the other kids in it 
 ProtagonistA was a very average looking man , with brown hair and eyes 
 ProtagonistA worked in an office and lived in a small apartment 
 ProtagonistA was generally a happy person , but ProtagonistA had a few things that ProtagonistA was not happy about 
 ProtagonistA did n't like ProtagonistA's job , but ProtagonistA needed the money 
 ProtagonistA was also not happy with ProtagonistA's apartment 
 But , ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life overall 
 ProtagonistA had good friends and a good family 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a troublemaker 
 As a young man , ProtagonistA was always getting into mischief 
 But , ProtagonistA was also a man of ProtagonistA's word 
 When ProtagonistA made a promise , ProtagonistA kept it 
 ProtagonistA wanted to start fresh and be known for being honest 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner 
 ProtagonistA never really fit in with any group of friends 
 But , ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's own company 
 ProtagonistA liked to read and explore the world around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA wanted to start fresh and see if ProtagonistA could make a new life for ProtagonistA 
 So far , ProtagonistA was doing well 
 ProtagonistA had found a job that ProtagonistA liked and was making new friends 
 ProtagonistA was even dating ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA still felt like ProtagonistA was lying to everyone 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistA could keep up the act of being someone ProtagonistA wasn't 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to tell ProtagonistB the truth 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's past and why ProtagonistA had changed ProtagonistA's name 
 And , ProtagonistA was finally able to start living ProtagonistA's life the way ProtagonistA wanted to 
 But then ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was thinking of ProtagonistA too much , and not of others 
 ProtagonistA tried to think of others more , but it was hard 
 ProtagonistA was so used to thinking of ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA kept trying , and eventually ProtagonistA started thinking of others more than ProtagonistA 
 And ProtagonistA was happy 
Once upon a time , when the world was young , ProtagonistA was walking home one cold Thursday evening in August 
 ProtagonistA came upon a little stone church on a green and flowery street , or in better letters Rickson , on the south side of that city , in which the main thoroughfares led down to the narrow streets and galleries of the lower part of the town 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , then decided to go in 
 ProtagonistA sat down in a pew and let out a deep sigh 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure how long ProtagonistA sat there , but eventually ProtagonistA became aware of someone moving around in the church 
 ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes to see ProtagonistB coming down the aisle , carrying a broom 
 ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's feet and smiled 
 ProtagonistA was just about to leave anyway 
 As ProtagonistA walked out of the church , ProtagonistA felt a sense of calm and well - being that ProtagonistA had not felt in a long time 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would come back to this place again 
 ProtagonistA was content with what ProtagonistA had and did n't want for anything more 
 ProtagonistA was suddenly a millionaire and did n't know how to handle it 
 ProtagonistA was smart with ProtagonistA's money , but ProtagonistA quickly realized that money could n't buy happiness 
 ProtagonistA was still ProtagonistA , just with a lot more money 
ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA was going to steal my twin sisters , but I thought ProtagonistA was joking 
 But one night , ProtagonistA showed up at my house with a van and two of ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA had stolen my sisters and there was nothing I could do 
 ProtagonistA had a wife and two kids , and ProtagonistA worked at a boring office job 
 One day , ProtagonistA woke up and decided that ProtagonistA was done with ProtagonistA's boring life 
 ProtagonistA was going to quit ProtagonistA's job , sell ProtagonistA's house , and buy a one - way ticket to Europe 
 For the first time in ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA felt alive 
 ProtagonistA was seeing new places and meeting new people 
 ProtagonistA was finally doing what ProtagonistA wanted to do 
 And ProtagonistA loved every minute of it 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was exploring a small town in Italy , ProtagonistA came across a beautiful painting in a shop window 
 ProtagonistA went inside and asked to buy it 
 But ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA had to have it 
 But ProtagonistA did n't mind 
 ProtagonistA knew that this painting was going to be the start of a new chapter in ProtagonistA's life 
Your Majesty , it has come to pass in heaven , that there is ProtagonistA ; ProtagonistA can well remember what events have taken place in history 
 In the year 1666 , ProtagonistA remembers , a great fire burned in the city of London 
 In 1812 , ProtagonistA was there when Napoleon invaded Russia 
 And in 1914 , ProtagonistA saw the start of the First World War 
 Now , in 2018 , ProtagonistA has seen another great event take place : the coronation of King George VI 
ProtagonistA was out for a walk one day when ProtagonistA came across a strange creature ProtagonistA had never seen before 
 ProtagonistA decided to approach it and see if ProtagonistA could make friends with this strange little creature 
 When ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that the creature was actually a fairy ! ProtagonistA had never seen a real fairy before and was quite excited 
 ProtagonistA introduced ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was amazed by all the things ProtagonistB could do with ProtagonistB's magic and ProtagonistA loved hearing ProtagonistB's stories about the world of the fairies 
 But ProtagonistA was happy to have made ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA knew they would always keep in touch 
ProtagonistA rose from among the ruins of the great forest , and at first sight , ProtagonistA appeared to be nothing more than a helpless , ragged visitor 
 ProtagonistA was a kind and gentle soul , and ProtagonistA quickly won the hearts of everyone in the village 
 One day , ProtagonistA went into the forest to explore 
 ProtagonistA soon discovered that ProtagonistA had a special connection to the forest and could communicate with the animals 
 ProtagonistA began to share ProtagonistA's wisdom with the villagers and helped them to understand the importance of taking care of the forest 
 ProtagonistA quickly became a respected member of the village and was loved by all 
 ProtagonistA was able to bring new life to the village and help everyone to see the beauty in the world around them 
ProtagonistA had been walking home from work when the rain started 
 ProtagonistA was n't carrying an umbrella , and ProtagonistA's shoes and coat were getting soaked 
 ProtagonistA was about to turn back when ProtagonistA saw a light in the distance 
 ProtagonistA started walking towards it , and when ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA saw a manhole cover in the middle of the street 
 ProtagonistA lifted it up , and climbed down into the sewer 
 ProtagonistA felt around until ProtagonistA found a ladder , and started climbing up 
 ProtagonistA could hear the rain above ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was getting scared 
 ProtagonistA climbed higher and higher , until ProtagonistA finally saw a light 
 ProtagonistA climbed out of the manhole and into the street 
ProtagonistA sat and watched the sun go down slowly , with ProtagonistA's eyes closed 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately , and needed this moment to just relax and clear ProtagonistA's head 
 As the sun set , ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's worries start to fade away 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and let it out slowly 
ProtagonistA had been driving the carriage for years , ever since ProtagonistA was a young boy 
 ProtagonistA loved the horses and the open road 
 But now , at the age of sixty , ProtagonistA was ready to retire 
 ProtagonistA had sold the horses and the carriage , and was now in the process of packing up ProtagonistA's things 
 But at least ProtagonistA was finally retiring 
 ProtagonistA could now spend ProtagonistA's days doing whatever ProtagonistA wanted , and ProtagonistA was looking forward to it 
ProtagonistA is a very strange man 
 ProtagonistA always seems to be laughing to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA always has a weird look on ProtagonistA's face 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking down the street , laughing to ProtagonistA as usual 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA slipped and fell on a banana peel 
 ProtagonistA laughed even harder as ProtagonistA got up and continued on ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA did n't mind though 
 ProtagonistA was just happy to be making people laugh 
ProtagonistA had been playing for hours , and the time had come for ProtagonistA to break out of ProtagonistA's gloomy cell and play 
 ProtagonistA had been playing for hours , and ProtagonistA was ready to breakout 
 ProtagonistA had been planning ProtagonistA's escape for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally ready 
 ProtagonistA had dug a hole in the wall of ProtagonistA's cell , and ProtagonistA was ready to make ProtagonistA's escape 
 ProtagonistA was about to break out when ProtagonistA heard someone coming 
 ProtagonistA quickly hid in ProtagonistA's cell , and ProtagonistA waited for the coast to clear 
 When the coast was clear , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's escape 
 ProtagonistA was free , and ProtagonistA was finally able to play 
ProtagonistA was having a great time at the party 
 ProtagonistA was dancing and laughing with all ProtagonistA's friends 
 ProtagonistA did n't even notice when ProtagonistA started to feel dizzy 
 The next thing ProtagonistA knew , ProtagonistA was falling 
 ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistA's head on the ground and died instantly 
ProtagonistA , in the year 1581 , appeared on the scene with a discovery ProtagonistA could not have dreamed of three years before : in the journal of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA found two passages which ProtagonistA named The Book of Dreams 
 ProtagonistA was amazed by these passages and decided to try to find the city of glass and the flying man 
 ProtagonistA set out on a journey and , after many adventures , ProtagonistA found the city of glass 
 ProtagonistA also found the flying man , who turned out to be ProtagonistB was amazed at ProtagonistA's discovery and decided to write a book about it 
ProtagonistA was a young boy living in London during the 1600s 
 ProtagonistA was a street urchin who would chat with pedestrians and shopkeepers in order to get a few coins 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life , even though it was hard 
 One summer day , ProtagonistA was walking around London when ProtagonistA noticed that the streets were eerily quiet 
 ProtagonistA did n't see any pedestrians or shopkeepers around 
 ProtagonistA started to feel uneasy and decided to head back home 
 When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistA's family was sick 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to find help 
 ProtagonistA went back out into the streets and started shouting for help 
Not long ago , when ProtagonistA was a boy , when ProtagonistA only knew how to read and write , ProtagonistA sent ProtagonistB a card that read : Beg for ProtagonistB's help 
 ProtagonistA never forgot how ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA's rescue when ProtagonistA needed ProtagonistB the most 
ProtagonistA sat on a rock on the banks of ProtagonistA's stream and stared out at the water in disbelief 
Ever since the day ProtagonistA was born , ProtagonistA has asked ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA was really made of , and yet always comes away with the same conclusion : ProtagonistA is a very odd little thing indeed ! As a child , ProtagonistA would often find ProtagonistA wondering why ProtagonistA was so different from everyone else 
 ProtagonistA would ask ProtagonistA's parents , ProtagonistA's teachers , and even ProtagonistA's friends , but no one could ever give ProtagonistA a satisfactory answer 
 As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to accept that ProtagonistA was just a weird little guy and that was that 
 ProtagonistA did n't let it bother ProtagonistA too much , and ProtagonistA actually found that ProtagonistA quite liked being different 
 Nowadays , ProtagonistA is still asking people what they think ProtagonistA is made of , but ProtagonistA does n't do it in a search for answers anymore 
 ProtagonistA does it simply because it 's fun to see the look of confusion on their faces 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA 'll never really know the answer to ProtagonistA's question , but that 's okay with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 's happy just being ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was always loitering around the park , and ProtagonistB was sure ProtagonistA was up to no good 
 ProtagonistA 're not going to terrorize this park anymore 
  ProtagonistA tried to run , but ProtagonistB was faster 
ProtagonistA twirled the peg - leg around in ProtagonistA's eyes , and the tough leather straps under ProtagonistA's arms , as ProtagonistA stood on the platform of one of the other ships that crowded the bottom of the middle city 
 ProtagonistA was a tall , lanky man , with a long , thin face that was almost always topped with a faded blue bandana 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a worn leather jacket and a pair of faded jeans 
 ProtagonistA was waiting for the ship that would take ProtagonistA to the top of the city 
 ProtagonistA had been waiting for a long time , and ProtagonistA was getting impatient 
 ProtagonistA wanted to get out of the middle city and see the world 
 ProtagonistA had heard stories about the top of the city , and ProtagonistA was eager to see it for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA boarded the ship , and it set sail for the top of the city 
 As the ship sailed through the middle city , ProtagonistA looked down at the people below 
 ProtagonistA felt a sense of power and excitement as ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was finally going to see the world 
 ProtagonistA looked around , and ProtagonistA's eyes widened in wonder 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had finally arrived in the place ProtagonistA had always dreamed of 
ProtagonistA sat in the saddle and considered the plan ProtagonistA 'd been given 
 ProtagonistA was to ride into town and ask around for ProtagonistB 
 Once ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was to bring ProtagonistB back to the ranch 
 ProtagonistA had never been good at talking to women , and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would n't be any different 
 But , ProtagonistA was a man of ProtagonistA's word , and ProtagonistA would do as ProtagonistA was asked 
 ProtagonistA just hoped that ProtagonistA would n't make a fool of ProtagonistA in the process 
ProtagonistA had a solid build , and a big , broad smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA was always the life of the party , and always had a kind word for everyone 
 ProtagonistA was the kind of guy that you just could n't help but like 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking around ProtagonistA's neighborhood , when ProtagonistA ran into ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA listened patiently , and then offered some words of encouragement 
 ProtagonistB was surprised at how positive ProtagonistA was , and it made ProtagonistB feel a little better 
 ProtagonistA continued on ProtagonistA's way , spreading ProtagonistA's happiness and good cheer to everyone ProtagonistA met 
 ProtagonistA was always making people smile , and that was one of the things that made ProtagonistA so special 
ProtagonistA had been on the road for months , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to get homesick 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's cozy little house and ProtagonistA's comfortable bed 
 Most of all , ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been all over the world , and ProtagonistA had seen some amazing things , but ProtagonistA was ready to be done with this whole traveling business 
 ProtagonistA wanted to go home and take a long nap 
 One morning , ProtagonistA woke up in ProtagonistA's hotel room in Japan and decided that today was the day ProtagonistA was going to head back home 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to be home , and ProtagonistA vowed to never go on another long journey again 
ProtagonistA had nothing to do with it , ProtagonistA said 
 But I know ProtagonistA did 
 However , ProtagonistA soon recovered ProtagonistA's senses and was filled with energy and activity 
 ProtagonistA was eager to promote ProtagonistA's empire and to help the conquered armies 
 ProtagonistA was so astonished by this sight that ProtagonistA could not help but stare 
 ProtagonistA could not tear ProtagonistA's eyes away from them , and ProtagonistA did not want to make a sound , lest ProtagonistA break the spell 
 ProtagonistA stood there for what seemed like hours , until finally the moon began to rise 
 ProtagonistA might not be a good unicorn , but ProtagonistA 's not going anywhere 
 ProtagonistA was grateful to ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's kindness , and ProtagonistA vowed to never leave ProtagonistB's side 
ProtagonistA had just turned eleven , and ProtagonistA was already a successful businessman 
 ProtagonistA had started ProtagonistA's own company when ProtagonistA was just ten years old , and it was already doing very well 
 ProtagonistA was always busy with work , and ProtagonistA did n't have much time for anything else 
 It was the first time ProtagonistA had ever been to something like this , and ProtagonistA was very excited 
 It was a business conference , and ProtagonistA was able to meet and talk to some of the most successful people in the world 
 ProtagonistA was also able to learn a lot about the business world , and ProtagonistA was very inspired by what ProtagonistA heard 
 ProtagonistA was very excited , and ProtagonistA immediately said yes 
 ProtagonistA was eager to get started , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could be successful if ProtagonistA worked hard 
 ProtagonistA took their advice to heart , and ProtagonistA quickly became one of the most successful young businessmen in the world 
 ProtagonistA was able to achieve ProtagonistA's dreams , and ProtagonistA was able to help others achieve their dreams as well 
ProtagonistA had been driving for hours , and was getting tired 
 ProtagonistA had been on the road for days , and was getting sick of the cold , grey weather 
 ProtagonistA was getting close to London , and was looking forward to getting out of the cold and into the warmth of the city 
 As ProtagonistA drove , ProtagonistA saw in the distance what looked like a huge city , on a smooth , grey sea 
 ProtagonistA was getting closer and closer , and could see the ships and the trading post 
 ProtagonistA was about to enter the world of the great traders and navigators , when ProtagonistA suddenly realized that ProtagonistA had no idea what ProtagonistA was doing 
 ProtagonistA had never been to London before , and had no idea how to get around 
 ProtagonistA pulled over to the side of the road and got out of ProtagonistA's car 
 ProtagonistA was about to enter the world of the great traders and navigators , and ProtagonistA had no idea what ProtagonistA was doing 
ProtagonistA woke up from ProtagonistA's dream feeling very confused 
 ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was in a vast garden , surrounded by a crowd of people 
 ProtagonistA saw a historian , a naturalist , a sculptor , and racing horses 
 ProtagonistA also saw one or two ladies standing upon a hill 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in a dream 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what was going on 
 Then ProtagonistA heard someone say ,  Welcome to ProtagonistA's future , ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB standing there 
 ProtagonistB continued ,  ProtagonistA are going to have a very special role to play in this world 
 ProtagonistA are going to be a great leader 
  ProtagonistA was surprised to hear this 
 ProtagonistA did n't feel like ProtagonistA was anything special 
 ProtagonistA must embrace it 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure if it was all a dream or not , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistA's future 
ProtagonistA had been hiking in the Colorado hills for days when ProtagonistA came across a rattlesnake 
 ProtagonistA was able to make it back to town , but ProtagonistA was in a lot of pain 
 ProtagonistA loved hiking and being in the outdoors 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to live without it 
 ProtagonistA started doing research and found out about prosthetic legs 
 ProtagonistA got a prosthetic leg and started hiking again 
 ProtagonistA was slower than ProtagonistA used to be , but ProtagonistA was still able to enjoy the outdoors 
 ProtagonistA shows that anything is possible if you set your mind to it 
ProtagonistA was riding in the midst of a dry and calm autumn season , riding on clear , and ProtagonistA knew that the wind of Britain was blowing , and that ProtagonistA was safe and that ProtagonistA would have to ride on — it was a familiar feeling to ProtagonistA — and ProtagonistA was riding on comfortable white , and ProtagonistA knew that the air was cool and that if ProtagonistA was found hanged ProtagonistA could always lie down for a long time and sleep peacefully and rest easy 
 ProtagonistA was a kindly old man , and ProtagonistA's face was wrinkled with the years , but ProtagonistA's eyes were blue and clear , and ProtagonistA's hair was white as the driven snow 
 ProtagonistA had a wife and children , and a home , and ProtagonistA was very happy 
 And so ProtagonistA died 
 ProtagonistA , in turn , thanked them for their faith in ProtagonistA and promised to serve the order to the best of ProtagonistA's ability 
 ProtagonistA was a big man , and ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA did n't kill ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB would kill ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA did n't want to die 
 ProtagonistA wanted to live 
 ProtagonistA wanted to eat ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA could n't kill ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA just could n't do it 
 ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's father and the only family ProtagonistB had ever known 
ProtagonistA died 
 ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistB do n't know why anyone would want to rob ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was a nice guy 
ProtagonistA had been a fan of the Hogsmeade Horror series since ProtagonistA was a child 
 Now , as ProtagonistA sat in ProtagonistA's local bookshop , ProtagonistA held the final edition of the Hogsmeade Horror Book in ProtagonistA's hands 
 ProtagonistA had been waiting for this moment for years 
 ProtagonistA flipped through the pages , taking in the revised and corrected story 
 As ProtagonistA read , ProtagonistA felt a sense of excitement and suspense building inside of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA could feel the hairs on the back of ProtagonistA's neck standing up as the story unfolded 
 ProtagonistA was so engrossed in the book that ProtagonistA did n't even hear the door of the bookshop open 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA was aware of someone standing over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA looked up to see a figure dressed in black , with a hood pulled up over its head 
 Can ProtagonistA help you ?  ProtagonistA asked , ProtagonistA's voice trembling slightly 
 ProtagonistA tried to hold on , but the figure was too strong 
 Hey ! That 's mine !  ProtagonistA protested 
In any other part of the world , ProtagonistA , if ProtagonistA were younger , would be a hundred years old , and ProtagonistA's name might well be Mary Wollstonecraft 
 But in this part of the world , ProtagonistA is only fifty years old , and ProtagonistA's name is still Bob 
 ProtagonistA does n't mind , though 
 ProtagonistA 's happy with ProtagonistA's life , even if it is a bit unusual 
 ProtagonistA knows that there are other parts of the world where people are born different genders , and ProtagonistA 's always been fascinated by them 
 But ProtagonistA 's happy where ProtagonistA is , and ProtagonistA does n't think ProtagonistA 'll ever leave 
ProtagonistA had been working at the hotel for years and had seen all sorts of dishes come and go 
 So , when ProtagonistA saw the dish next to ProtagonistA on the table , ProtagonistA did n't think much of it 
 ProtagonistA slowly approached the dish , not wanting to believe what ProtagonistA was seeing 
 ProtagonistA quickly walked away from the table , not wanting to see any more 
 ProtagonistA knew this would be something that ProtagonistA would never forget , no matter how many years ProtagonistA worked at the hotel 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a trouble , but ProtagonistA had been more of a bother than most when ProtagonistA had been twelve 
 ProtagonistA had gotten into a lot of fights and had been kicked out of school 
 ProtagonistA had been a lost cause 
 ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA falling for ProtagonistB and , for the first time in ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA wanted to be a better person 
 ProtagonistA wanted to make ProtagonistB proud of ProtagonistA 
 And so ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA stopped getting into fights and ProtagonistA went back to school 
 ProtagonistA even got good grades 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to see the water droplet again and followed it as it bounced around the garden 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB's most recent folly 
 ProtagonistA cried out ,  Wait , that 's a new plot ! ProtagonistA have to see this !  ProtagonistA ran over to where ProtagonistB was and watched as ProtagonistB executed ProtagonistB's plan 
   ProtagonistA was about to get up and investigate when ProtagonistA heard a noise from inside the house 
   ProtagonistA slowly stood up and made ProtagonistA's way to the back door 
   ProtagonistA was about to knock when ProtagonistA heard a voice from inside 
   ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment ,   but then ProtagonistA made up ProtagonistA's mind 
   ProtagonistA was going to find out what was going on inside that house 
ProtagonistA was a smart little thing , almost two years old , who was not really a girl , but which people thought was a girl , because ProtagonistA would turn into a big good - for - nothing known as ' Sophia ' instead of into a girl , and ProtagonistA had been mistaken , they say , from the first moment when ProtagonistA was born , and ProtagonistA had believed everything ProtagonistA had been told 
 But one day , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was not really a girl , and ProtagonistA decided to turn into a boy instead 
 And from that day on , ProtagonistA was a boy , and ProtagonistA was happy 
ProtagonistA had been a librarian for over forty years , and in that time ProtagonistA had seen a lot of things 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head sadly 
  What a sad sight , to lose one 's mind ,  ProtagonistA said 
As soon as ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the bed and stared out the window 
 ProtagonistA would be in ProtagonistA's bed , in ProtagonistA's room and ProtagonistA would wake up to find ProtagonistA in a strange place 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what the dream meant , but ProtagonistA was starting to get worried 
 ProtagonistA got up and went to the window , looking out at the city below 
 ProtagonistA had always loved the city , but now it just felt like a prison 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going crazy 
 ProtagonistA just shook ProtagonistA's head and said ProtagonistA did n't know 
 ProtagonistA could n't tell ProtagonistB about the dream , ProtagonistA did n't want ProtagonistB to think ProtagonistA was losing ProtagonistA's mind 
 ProtagonistA nodded , but ProtagonistA did n't feel any better 
 ProtagonistA was still scared and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
Bob was wearing the same dress , and the same red dress , and the same black dress , and at the same time ProtagonistA was in the same place , in the same sudden moment , in the same instant , in the same place , in the same place , ProtagonistA was in the same place , ProtagonistA was wearing the same dress , and the same dress , and ProtagonistA was walking along , and ProtagonistA just kept walking , and ProtagonistA stopped in a little corner ( not much to go on there , there 's no way to tell where exactly ) and looked around for a second , and then laid ProtagonistA's head down on the hood of the car and leaned ProtagonistA's head against the passenger side window 
ProtagonistA had been studying the chart for hours , and ProtagonistA was finally able to make sense of it 
 ProtagonistA was going to be famous 
 ProtagonistA quickly packed ProtagonistA's things and set off for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was going to be the first person to find ProtagonistB in over two thousand years 
 ProtagonistA arrived at the coordinates ProtagonistA had found on the chart , and there ProtagonistB was : ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had done it 
 ProtagonistA quickly took some pictures and then made ProtagonistA's way back to civilization to share ProtagonistA's discovery with the world 
 ProtagonistA was going to be famous 
 ProtagonistA was lying on the ground , motionless 
 ProtagonistA had been with ProtagonistA since they were both young men , and now ProtagonistA was gone 
ProtagonistA was in a meeting with ProtagonistA's boss and the boss 's boss 
 ProtagonistA put them down on the table and started to leaf through them 
 ProtagonistA found the section ProtagonistA was looking for and started to read 
ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had picked the pocket of a gentleman in London 
 ProtagonistA was getting tired and was ready to call it a day when ProtagonistA saw a farmhouse in the distance 
 ProtagonistA figured ProtagonistA could maybe get a bite to eat there and then be on ProtagonistA's way 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA saw a man and a woman sitting on the porch 
 Are ProtagonistA looking for a place to stay for the night?Bob was hesitant , but ProtagonistA was tired and hungry , so ProtagonistA decided to go over to the farmhouse 
 Yes , sir , ProtagonistA am 
 ProtagonistA do n't have any money , but ProtagonistA can work for food 
 ProtagonistA was so grateful that ProtagonistA did n't even try to bargain for more 
 ProtagonistA was finally starting to feel like things were going to get better for ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA came in a beaten and battered carriage and was carrying ProtagonistB across the country 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's life , and this was just another adventure 
 ProtagonistB was injured and needed help , so ProtagonistA was going to take ProtagonistB to the nearest town 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what was going to happen , but ProtagonistA was ready for anything 
ProtagonistA had seen true horror cross flying over a dozen times during ProtagonistA's time as head of the Department of Magical and Philosophical Research , but ProtagonistA never imagined that one might actually be made at the end of one 's life ! As ProtagonistA lay on ProtagonistA's deathbed , ProtagonistA could see the dark shape of the creature looming over ProtagonistA , its red eyes gleaming with hunger 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's time was up 
ProtagonistA was standing in the doorway , ProtagonistA's dark hair up in a ponytail 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a black t - shirt and jeans and looked like ProtagonistA was ready to go 
 Hi ,  ProtagonistA said 
 Finally , ProtagonistA broke the silence 
 I'm here to talk to you about something ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'm not sure how to say it , so ProtagonistA 'm just going to say it 
 I'm gay ,  ProtagonistA said 
 It 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA just wanted to tell you 
 ProtagonistA hope we can still be friends 
 I was glad that ProtagonistA was still my friend 
 ProtagonistA tried to laugh it off , but it was clear that ProtagonistA was deeply embarrassed 
 But eventually , ProtagonistA did , and ProtagonistA even managed to laugh about the incident 
ProtagonistA was a volcanologist who had dedicated ProtagonistA's life to studying volcanoes 
 ProtagonistA had traveled all over the world to study them , and ProtagonistA had even written a few books on the subject 
 ProtagonistA finally got ProtagonistA's chance when ProtagonistA was invited to study the great volcano up close 
 But as ProtagonistA began ProtagonistA's studies , ProtagonistA started to notice something strange 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it , but it was true 
 ProtagonistA alerted the other scientists , and they started to evacuate the area 
 ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA's best to save ProtagonistB , but it was too late 
 Now , ProtagonistA was all alone in the world 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner , but now ProtagonistA felt truly isolated 
 ProtagonistA had no one to turn to in ProtagonistA's time of need 
 ProtagonistA had to keep going , for ProtagonistB's sake 
 With a heavy heart , ProtagonistA continued on 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would want ProtagonistA to live and be happy , even if ProtagonistA could n't be there with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was a very average looking guy 
 ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB and two kids 
 ProtagonistA worked at a factory 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's wife and kids very much 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to lose them 
 ProtagonistA decided to try to win ProtagonistB back 
 ProtagonistA started to do things that ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB liked 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB out on dates and bought ProtagonistB's flowers 
 ProtagonistA did everything ProtagonistA could think of 
 ProtagonistA was so happy 
 ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had tried to win ProtagonistB back 
ProtagonistA was having a great day 
 ProtagonistA had a delicious dinner , a handsome present for ProtagonistA's father , and the honor of being admitted to a certain gentleman 's house 
 ProtagonistA was glad the day was beautiful ; yet , ProtagonistA knew a prince of this kingdom must have a pretty house , a pretty air , and a pretty garden , or it was no good 
ProtagonistA was facing away from the screen on the golden - tufted hill that bounded ProtagonistA's sea - walls , and the sunbeams streaming across the black sand stilled as it was 
 ProtagonistA was the picture of health and vigor , but there was a stillness in ProtagonistA , a peace that came from knowing who ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA had everything ProtagonistA could ever want , but it was n't enough 
 ProtagonistA was restless , searching for something more 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what it was , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to find it 
 ProtagonistA turned and looked at the screen 
 ProtagonistA had seen too much of the darkness , and ProtagonistA longed for the light 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where to find it , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to keep looking 
ProtagonistA had been standing in the doorway all night , waiting for ProtagonistB 
 As the hours passed , ProtagonistA began to doubt ProtagonistB would ever show up 
 ProtagonistA was just about to give up and go to bed when ProtagonistA heard a noise outside 
 ProtagonistA looked out the window and saw ProtagonistB walking up the path 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA ran out to meet ProtagonistB 
 They spent the night catching up and ProtagonistA was happy to finally have ProtagonistB back in ProtagonistA's life 
In the early summer of 1831 , ProtagonistA was living in the vast old house of ProtagonistA's cousin , the lady Madame Bors ( the name of the owner of the property ) , in a part of Pannonward called the Park 
 ProtagonistA had been living there for several months , and ProtagonistA loved it 
 ProtagonistA loved the peace and quiet of the Park , and ProtagonistA loved the company of ProtagonistB 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the Park when ProtagonistA came across a small , abandoned house 
 ProtagonistA was curious , so ProtagonistA went inside 
 ProtagonistA explored the house , and ProtagonistA found a secret room 
 Inside the secret room , ProtagonistA found a treasure trove of old coins and jewelry 
ProtagonistA had only been a woman of ProtagonistA's word , when a magic box stood in ProtagonistA's front door , containing a box of eleven tiny little things , wrapped in a blue and white little envelope 
 ProtagonistA knew what they were , and ProtagonistA knew what they could do 
 ProtagonistA carefully opened the envelope and took out one of the tiny things 
 ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA squeezed it , it would start beating 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had been trying to have a baby for years 
 ProtagonistA was over the moon 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it had finally happened 
 ProtagonistA was going to be a dad 
 ProtagonistA reassured ProtagonistB that everything would be alright 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would be there for ProtagonistB's every step of the way 
 ProtagonistA thought about it for a while and then said that ProtagonistA would love a dog 
ProtagonistA was a handsome and charming man , though ProtagonistA's appearance sometimes caused consternation in ProtagonistA's fellow travellers 
 ProtagonistA was well known throughout the city and was always friendly and helpful 
 One day , ProtagonistA was helping ProtagonistB with ProtagonistB's luggage when ProtagonistA slipped and fell , hitting ProtagonistA's head on a rock 
 When ProtagonistA finally woke up , ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's memory 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistA was or where ProtagonistA came from 
 ProtagonistA did n't know ProtagonistB's name , but ProtagonistA was determined to find ProtagonistB 
 With the help of ProtagonistA's friends , ProtagonistA was able to find ProtagonistB and return ProtagonistB's luggage to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA still does n't remember who ProtagonistA is , but ProtagonistA is happy living ProtagonistA's life helping others 
 ProtagonistA was the daughter of Henry Vane , Earl of Essex , cousin of King James ; and , as is usual with them , ProtagonistA's father was a king 
 ProtagonistA was a very beautiful young woman , and ProtagonistA had a very kind heart 
 ProtagonistA was always helping others , and ProtagonistA was always trying to make everyone happy 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the forest , and ProtagonistA came across ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong , and ProtagonistB said that ProtagonistB was lost 
 ProtagonistA offered to help ProtagonistB find ProtagonistB's way home , and ProtagonistB did 
 ProtagonistA was always well - dressed and had a kind face 
 One evening , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was going to leave town 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had been offered a job in a faraway place and ProtagonistA was going to take it 
 ProtagonistA left town the next day , and ProtagonistB never saw ProtagonistA again 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of ProtagonistA's bed , looking out at the booming blue sky 
 ProtagonistA was happy 
 ProtagonistA had just gotten out of bed and was about to start ProtagonistA's day 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a loud noise 
 ProtagonistA got up to see what it was 
 When ProtagonistA looked out the window , ProtagonistA saw a huge cloud of smoke 
 ProtagonistA knew that something terrible had happened 
 ProtagonistA had to find out what it was 
 ProtagonistA was going to the city to find out what had happened 
 And so , ProtagonistA built a house for the phoenix on ProtagonistA's farm 
ProtagonistA was a bright young boy , but ProtagonistA was always a little bit different from the other kids at school 
 ProtagonistA had bright red hair , and bright blue eyes , and ProtagonistA always seemed to be looking at the world in a different way 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to make of it , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were different 
ProtagonistA had been sleeping all that time and was still sleeping when ProtagonistA began to cry 
ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had seen war , famine , and death 
 ProtagonistA had seen people suffer and die 
 ProtagonistA had seen the worst of humanity 
 But ProtagonistA had also seen the best of humanity 
 ProtagonistA had seen people help each other in times of need 
 ProtagonistA had seen people come together in times of crisis 
 ProtagonistA had seen the human spirit triumph over adversity 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot , but ProtagonistA had never been through anything like this 
 ProtagonistA had been through hell 
 ProtagonistA had seen things that no one should ever have to see 
 ProtagonistA had seen people do things that no one should ever have to do 
 ProtagonistA had seen the worst of humanity , and it had scarred ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA was a survivor 
 ProtagonistA had survived war , famine , and death 
 ProtagonistA had survived the worst of humanity 
 And ProtagonistA would survive this 
ProtagonistA stood on the doorstep of ProtagonistA's house , watching ProtagonistB , drive into the town with ProtagonistB's wife 
 ProtagonistA felt a pang of jealousy as ProtagonistA watched the two of them drive off together 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA should be happy for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a little bit left out 
 ProtagonistA went back inside the house and sat down at the kitchen table 
 ProtagonistA got up to see who it was and was surprised to see ProtagonistB getting out of the car 
 That 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said , trying to hide the relief in ProtagonistA's voice 
  Do ProtagonistA want to come into town with us?No , that 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA 'll just stay here 
 Yeah , ProtagonistA 'm sure ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA watched them go , feeling a little bit lonely 
ProtagonistA is sitting down by the window , reading a book which ProtagonistA has brought into ProtagonistA's room , and without speaking 
 ProtagonistA has read it many times before , but ProtagonistA always enjoys reading it again 
 ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistB is someone who is just like ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had always wanted a man with blond hair , but when ProtagonistA was eight the first color on ProtagonistA's face changed into something untidy and unpleasant 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's identity 
 ProtagonistA did n't feel like ProtagonistA belonged anywhere 
 ProtagonistA did n't feel like ProtagonistA was attractive anymore 
 ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA was invisible 
 One day , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was so handsome and ProtagonistA could n't take ProtagonistA's eyes off of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA felt a stirring in ProtagonistA's heart and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was the man ProtagonistA had been waiting for 
 ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistB's hair was n't blond anymore , ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB for who ProtagonistB was 
ProtagonistA turned into the white stucco garden where ProtagonistA was working and then into the street 
 ProtagonistA had been working in the garden for hours , and ProtagonistA's back was sore 
 ProtagonistA was looking forward to a cold beer and a hot shower 
 As ProtagonistA walked down the street , ProtagonistA saw a group of young men hanging out on the corner 
 ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , but they called out to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was about to run when ProtagonistA felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's back 
 ProtagonistA fell to the ground , and the last thing ProtagonistA saw was the group of men standing over ProtagonistA , laughing 
 ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's only child , and ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA dearly 
 ProtagonistA was a happy child , always laughing and playing 
 ProtagonistA was never naughty , and always did as ProtagonistA was told 
 ProtagonistA ran to ProtagonistB , crying and screaming for help 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA would go on without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had to be strong , and ProtagonistA slowly began to heal 
 ProtagonistA started to laugh and play again , and ProtagonistA even went back to the park 
 Now , every time ProtagonistA visits the park , ProtagonistA thinks of ProtagonistB and the wonderful times they had together 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistB is always with ProtagonistA , watching over ProtagonistA from the stars 
 ProtagonistA was driving erratically , and ProtagonistB was having a hard time keeping up 
ProtagonistA was a simple man who loved the way things were done 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life and did n't want for anything more 
ProtagonistA lay with ProtagonistA's legs crossed , rocking back and forth 
 ProtagonistA was in pain , and ProtagonistA knew it 
 ProtagonistA had been in and out of the hospital for the past year , and ProtagonistA's body was weak 
 ProtagonistA was tired of fighting , and ProtagonistA just wanted to let go 
 As ProtagonistA rocked back and forth , ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's wife , and ProtagonistA's children 
 ProtagonistA thought about all the things ProtagonistA had done , and all the things ProtagonistA had yet to do 
 ProtagonistA was at peace with ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA knew that it was time to let go 
 ProtagonistA was a good man , ProtagonistA was 
 Then , one day , ProtagonistA came to the palace and presented the head of a dragon to ProtagonistD 
 So , each morning ProtagonistA rose to school and ProtagonistA's parents dragged their loaded and battered car into the driveway 
 ProtagonistA was a bright student and worked hard to get good grades 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's parents were counting on ProtagonistA to make something of ProtagonistA 
 And ProtagonistA was determined to make them proud 
 One day , after ProtagonistA had graduated from college , ProtagonistA came home to find ProtagonistA's parents ' car gone from the driveway 
 ProtagonistA went inside and found them sitting at the kitchen table , smiling at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so happy to see ProtagonistA's parents finally getting to enjoy their retirement 
 ProtagonistA knew that their love and support had helped ProtagonistA succeed in life 
ProtagonistA had never seen anything like China before 
 ProtagonistA instantly fell in love with the country and its people 
 So , when ProtagonistA was old enough , ProtagonistA set off with Yede , ProtagonistB's donkey , to the Chinese orphanage where ProtagonistA had been born 
 Finally , ProtagonistA arrived at the orphanage 
 ProtagonistA quickly adapted to life at the orphanage 
 ProtagonistA loved learning about Chinese culture and history 
 ProtagonistA had found a home in China and was destined to give birth to an immortal emperor 
ProtagonistA had had a tough day 
 ProtagonistA had been walking along the banks of the Thames , in a sort of drunken stupor , when ProtagonistA slipped and fell into the water 
 ProtagonistA struggled to get out , but the current was too strong 
 ProtagonistA was always the one who was sent on errands , or to do the grocery shopping , and ProtagonistA's parents always had a serious talk with ProtagonistA before making any decisions 
 It was as if ProtagonistA was the head of the family , even though ProtagonistA was the youngest 
 ProtagonistA unrolled the bundle , and inside was a beautiful golden necklace 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had found it lying in the street , and that it must have belonged to a rich lady who had lost it 
 ProtagonistA was the one who always seemed to bring them good luck 
ProtagonistA was not what ProtagonistA had heard ProtagonistA was supposed to be 
 But ProtagonistA was none of those things 
 ProtagonistA was a boring guy , a guy that no one wanted to be around 
 ProtagonistA was the kind of guy that you would never want to talk to 
ProtagonistA had been working at the same office for 5 years 
 ProtagonistA had started to feel like ProtagonistA was in a rut and needed a change 
 When ProtagonistA walked out of the office for the last time , ProtagonistA felt a certain relief 
 ProtagonistA was a very happy man 
 ProtagonistA had a great job , a beautiful wife , and two lovely children 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 However , one day ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was grateful to ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA soon fell in love with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was nothing more than a mortal , and ProtagonistA had enough friends and lovers who ProtagonistA could trust 
 ProtagonistA became a legend , and ProtagonistA's friends and lovers became ProtagonistA's faithful followers 
When we first met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA had never seen any men 
 ProtagonistA was a bit intimidated at first , but ProtagonistA soon warmed up to us 
 ProtagonistA was a shy guy , but once ProtagonistA got to know us , ProtagonistA was a lot of fun 
 ProtagonistA was always up for a good time , and ProtagonistA was always the life of the party 
 ProtagonistA was a great friend , and we all loved ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA used to love ProtagonistA's boots , but they were as old as the southern mud and ProtagonistA hated the way they made ProtagonistA's feet feel so frail 
 ProtagonistA decided to go on a quest to find new boots that would make ProtagonistA feel young and spry again 
 After searching high and low , ProtagonistA finally found the perfect pair 
 Now , every time ProtagonistA puts them on , ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA can conquer the world 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner , never really fitting in with any group of friends 
 ProtagonistA had always been content with ProtagonistA's own company and never felt the need for anyone else 
 But now , as ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the cliff , looking out at the vastness of the ocean , ProtagonistA felt a loneliness like ProtagonistA had never felt before 
 ProtagonistA contemplated jumping off the cliff and ending it all , but ProtagonistA just could n't bring ProtagonistA to do it 
 ProtagonistA sat there for hours , until the sun began to set , and then ProtagonistA finally got up and walked back to ProtagonistA's car 
Over the last three years , when I have been able to visit the house where ProtagonistA fathomed ProtagonistA's dreams , ProtagonistA has changed little 
 ProtagonistA had this sparkle in ProtagonistA's eye , and I could tell ProtagonistA was truly passionate about life 
ProtagonistA had just lost ProtagonistA's job and ProtagonistA's girlfriend had just left ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was feeling pretty down on ProtagonistA's luck 
 ProtagonistB had always been the more impulsive one , but ProtagonistA had always been the one to hold ProtagonistB back 
 ProtagonistA was inconsolable after the funeral 
 ProtagonistA blamed ProtagonistA for ProtagonistB's death and felt like ProtagonistA did n't deserve to live 
 ProtagonistA could n't shake the feeling that ProtagonistB was still with ProtagonistA , somehow 
 As the days went by , ProtagonistA started to notice strange things happening 
 ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistA in places ProtagonistA did n't remember going to , and ProtagonistA had strange dreams 
 At first , ProtagonistA thought it was just ProtagonistA's mind playing tricks on ProtagonistA , but the more ProtagonistA thought about it , the more ProtagonistA realized it was true 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could n't tell anyone about it , because they would never believe ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA had to be careful , because if ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA would stay dead 
 ProtagonistA started to live ProtagonistA's life differently after that 
 ProtagonistA was more careful and deliberate in everything ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA also started to appreciate life more , because ProtagonistA knew how precious it was 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to make the most of ProtagonistA's time , because ProtagonistA now had eternity 
 ProtagonistA was a simple man , and ProtagonistA did n't understand why ProtagonistB would do such a thing 
 ProtagonistA had always been a good cook , and ProtagonistA had never done anything to deserve this 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's palace , and ProtagonistA begged ProtagonistB to lift the ban on ProtagonistA's cookery 
 ProtagonistA pleaded with ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB would not listen 
 ProtagonistA went home , and ProtagonistA was heartbroken 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do 
 ProtagonistA loved cooking , and it was ProtagonistA's passion 
 Without it , ProtagonistA felt lost 
 ProtagonistA decided to take matters into ProtagonistA's own hands 
 ProtagonistA snuck into ProtagonistB's palace kitchen and ProtagonistA cooked a meal 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be impressed 
 The next day , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's office , and ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB the meal ProtagonistA had cooked 
 ProtagonistA was a great cook , and ProtagonistA went on to have a successful career 
ProtagonistA was walking towards the door of ProtagonistB's room , shaking ProtagonistA's head 
 But as ProtagonistA got closer to the door , ProtagonistA could hear voices coming from inside 
 ProtagonistA paused for a moment , not sure what to do 
 Should ProtagonistA just go in and comfort ProtagonistB ? Or give ProtagonistB some space ? ProtagonistA decided to go in 
 As ProtagonistA walked in , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on the bed , phone in hand 
 ProtagonistA sat down next to ProtagonistB and put ProtagonistA's arm around ProtagonistB 
  It 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA stood there , though ProtagonistA was not quite sure why 
 ProtagonistA could hear a faint noise coming from somewhere , and ProtagonistA started to walk towards it 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that the noise was someone crying 
 ProtagonistA came to a door and slowly opened it 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA had gotten here , or where here even was 
 But ProtagonistA did know that ProtagonistA could n't just leave ProtagonistB here by ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA was old enough , ProtagonistA started working in the fields to help support ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA worked hard every day , rain or shine 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was working , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so excited and could n't believe it was happening 
 ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things and went to the palace to start ProtagonistA's new life 
ProtagonistA had been in the room for days , maybe weeks 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure 
 All ProtagonistA knew was that the walls were closing in on ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA was going stir crazy 
 ProtagonistA had begged , pleaded , and even threatened the guards , but they would n't let ProtagonistA leave 
 Finally , ProtagonistA had given up 
 ProtagonistA was just happy to be out of that tiny room 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how long ProtagonistA would be allowed to stay , but ProtagonistA was grateful for every second 
It was a pity to see ProtagonistA's head , ProtagonistB , all throbbing and squirmy , ProtagonistA's eyes so half - closed , said ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's sweetest voice 
  ProtagonistA just nodded , too exhausted to speak 
 ProtagonistA had been in and out of the hospital for weeks , and it was taking its toll on ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA 'll be all right ,  ProtagonistA said finally 
  ProtagonistA just need some rest 
  And with that , ProtagonistA turned over and went to sleep 
ProtagonistA had finally decided to carve a story for ProtagonistA's dead husband 
 It had been years since ProtagonistA's husband had passed away , and ProtagonistA had never been able to bring ProtagonistA to do it 
 But now , finally , ProtagonistA was ready 
 ProtagonistA sat down at ProtagonistA's kitchen table with a block of wood and a carving knife , and ProtagonistA began to carve 
 ProtagonistA carved a story of love and loss , of happiness and sorrow 
 ProtagonistA carved it all into the wood , pouring ProtagonistA's heart and soul into it 
 When ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistA stepped back and looked at ProtagonistA's work 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's husband would have loved it 
 ProtagonistA placed the carving on the mantle , and ProtagonistA went to bed with a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's husband was with ProtagonistA , and that ProtagonistA was at peace 
 It was a hot summer day and ProtagonistA was out in the yard , tending to ProtagonistA's garden 
 ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the bushes and went to investigate 
 There , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB , meowing pitifully 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB in and nursed ProtagonistB back to health 
 ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB's Mittens and ProtagonistB became ProtagonistA's best friend 
 Over the years , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB grew old together 
 ProtagonistA never expected to love ProtagonistB so much , but ProtagonistB was the best thing that ever happened to ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was four years old when ProtagonistA heard the news that ProtagonistC had been murdered 
 It was a cold winter day and ProtagonistA was inside playing with ProtagonistA's toys 
 ProtagonistA could n't hear what they were saying , but ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was upset 
 ProtagonistA was very sad and cried for a long time 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA , and so ProtagonistA says , but ProtagonistA's family did not believe ProtagonistA was really who ProtagonistA looked and spoke like 
 But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was not just going through a phase ; ProtagonistA was who ProtagonistA was 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to leave ProtagonistA's family 's home and go out into the world to find others like ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA eventually found a community of people who accepted ProtagonistA for who ProtagonistA was and ProtagonistA finally felt at home 
 ProtagonistA , however , seemed to be in a hurry and did not drink more than a few sips before setting ProtagonistA's cup down and getting up from the table 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA must be going now ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA stood on the beach , looking out at the sea 
 ProtagonistA had seen many things in ProtagonistA's life , but nothing had prepared ProtagonistA for the sight that greeted ProtagonistA now 
 ProtagonistA knew that this was the end 
 But ProtagonistA had to try 
 ProtagonistA turned and ran into the water 
 ProtagonistA had just returned from a weekend away and was looking forward to a quiet day at home 
 However , ProtagonistA was surprised to find ProtagonistA's wife and children already up and about 
 ProtagonistA was amazed at how early they had gotten up on a Sunday morning 
  ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA tried to get up , but ProtagonistA felt so weak 
 ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was in a hospital room 
 ProtagonistA must have been in a coma 
 ProtagonistA wanted to cry , but ProtagonistA could n't even do that 
ProtagonistA climbed down into the water , where ProtagonistA had been stripped of all ProtagonistA's clothing , and stood there , ProtagonistA's mind reeling 
 ProtagonistA had been in the water for hours , and ProtagonistA's body was numb 
 ProtagonistA could barely move ProtagonistA's arms or legs 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die soon 
 ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's life and all the things ProtagonistA had done 
 ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's family and friends 
 ProtagonistA was sorry ProtagonistA would never see them again 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and let go 
The first time ProtagonistB pulled ProtagonistA out of the park , ProtagonistA was in a tangle of newts , ProtagonistA's body in full view of the other newts 
 ProtagonistA was a mess , ProtagonistA's scales all over the place , and ProtagonistA's eyes were bulging out of ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA was still alive , but ProtagonistA was in a bad way 
ProtagonistA was frowning when ProtagonistA heard the blast , but ProtagonistA had n't seen anything yet 
 ProtagonistA slowly turned ProtagonistA's head to the left , and then to the right , trying to see what had caused the explosion 
 ProtagonistA started to run towards the site of the blast , but ProtagonistA was stopped by a police officer 
  ProtagonistA ca n't go any closer , ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA nodded and stepped back 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe what had happened 
ProtagonistA leaned into the glow of the fire , ProtagonistA's hands clasped behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knows exactly what ProtagonistA 's doing 
 If it works , ProtagonistA 'll be the first person in the world to be cured of ProtagonistA's rare disease 
 ProtagonistA knows the risks , but ProtagonistA 's willing to take them 
 After all , what 's the alternative ? Living a life of pain and suffering , slowly withering away until there 's nothing left ? No , ProtagonistA 's not going to let that happen 
 ProtagonistA 's going to fight for ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA 's going to win 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's wife danced the night away , and all of their guests had a wonderful time 
Before ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistA's life to be the best it could be , and ProtagonistA knew that it would only be the best possible if ProtagonistA made it that way 
 So , ProtagonistA set out to do just that 
 ProtagonistA started by making a list of all the things ProtagonistA wanted to do and see in ProtagonistA's life 
 Then , ProtagonistA started crossing them off one by one 
 ProtagonistA traveled to all the places ProtagonistA wanted to see , ProtagonistA did all the things ProtagonistA wanted to do , and ProtagonistA made sure to spend time with the people ProtagonistA loved most 
 In the end , ProtagonistA died happy knowing that ProtagonistA had lived ProtagonistA's life to the fullest 
The first time ProtagonistB met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was eleven years old 
 ProtagonistA was a new student at ProtagonistB's school , and ProtagonistB was assigned to show ProtagonistA around 
 ProtagonistA was quiet and shy , and ProtagonistA did n't seem to fit in with the other kids 
 ProtagonistA slowly started to open up , and before long , ProtagonistA was just another member of ProtagonistB's group of friends 
ProtagonistA never knew the difference between December and any other month 
 ProtagonistA would go to the parish church of St
 ProtagonistA would light a candle for ProtagonistA's deceased wife , and then ProtagonistA would leave 
 One day , as ProtagonistA was leaving the church , ProtagonistA ran into the priest 
 ProtagonistA told the priest that ProtagonistA came to pray for ProtagonistA's wife 
 ProtagonistA did n't know 
 ProtagonistA was amazed 
 ProtagonistA had never known that before 
 From then on , ProtagonistA made sure to pray extra hard in December , and ProtagonistA always remembered the birth of Jesus Christ 
 But now , ProtagonistA had to take ProtagonistB down 
 ProtagonistA was the only one who could 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and steadied ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had to do this 
 ProtagonistA raised ProtagonistA's gun and aimed 
 And then ProtagonistA pulled the trigger 
 It was a peaceful death , in his sleep , and ProtagonistA was grateful for that 
 ProtagonistA had seen too much death in ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA did n't want ProtagonistA's son to suffer 
 As ProtagonistA lay in ProtagonistA's bed , surrounded by ProtagonistA's family , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had done everything ProtagonistA could to make the world a better place 
 And now , ProtagonistA could rest 
 ProtagonistA was a giant of a man , and ProtagonistA seemed to be getting taller with every step 
 ProtagonistA was a gentle giant , but ProtagonistA was also a very strong one 
 ProtagonistA could easily crush a man 's skull with ProtagonistA's bare hands 
 ProtagonistA was it , and ProtagonistA was chasing them around 
 ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistA's head on a rock , and ProtagonistA was knocked unconscious 
 ProtagonistA woke up a few days later , and ProtagonistA was back to ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA is a gentle giant , but ProtagonistA 's also a strong one 
ProtagonistA had seen death before 
 ProtagonistA had seen it in the eyes of ProtagonistA's patients , in their final moments 
 ProtagonistA knew the look of a person who was about to die 
 But ProtagonistA had never seen it in the eyes of someone so young 
 Fourteen years ago , when ProtagonistA was conducting ProtagonistA's last examination of ProtagonistA's patients , ProtagonistA had an idea of what might befall ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be consumed by fear , that ProtagonistB would be tortured by the thought of ProtagonistB's own mortality 
 ProtagonistA knew that there was nothing ProtagonistA could do to ease ProtagonistB's suffering , but ProtagonistA stayed with ProtagonistB anyway , until the end 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA needed to find a way to help people come to terms with their own mortality 
 And so ProtagonistA started a support group for people who were afraid of death 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistB's death was not in vain , and that ProtagonistB's legacy will live on through the people ProtagonistA has helped 
ProtagonistA was a kindly old man who loved to help others 
 So when ProtagonistA saw the state of the flat , ProtagonistA was appalled 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door and was let in by ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA offered to help them clean up the place and to get them some food and supplies 
 ProtagonistA continued to help the tenants , and ProtagonistA soon became a good friend to them 
 ProtagonistA was always there for them when they needed help , and ProtagonistA was proud to have made a difference in their lives 
 ProtagonistA was a small town in the middle of nowhere 
ProtagonistA was a very pretty girl , with dark hair which fell to ProtagonistA's shoulders , a light complexion , strong eyebrows and a shining face 
 ProtagonistA was very excited to be there and to see all the sights 
 ProtagonistA sat on a bench and watched the people go by 
 ProtagonistA saw a lot of pretty girls , but none as pretty as ProtagonistA 
 After a while , ProtagonistA got up and walked around 
 ProtagonistA looked in shop windows and at the people in the street 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do next 
 ProtagonistA walked around for a while longer , and then ProtagonistA saw a sign for a museum 
 ProtagonistA had never been to a museum before , so ProtagonistA decided to go in 
 ProtagonistA looked at all the paintings and the sculptures 
 ProtagonistA was so fascinated by everything that ProtagonistA forgot to look at the time 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA started to panic , but then ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA went up to ProtagonistB and asked for help 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was lost and did n't know how to get home 
 ProtagonistA was very excited to tell ProtagonistA's parents about all the things ProtagonistA had seen 
 ProtagonistA had a great day , even though ProtagonistA got lost 
ProtagonistA sat on the edge of the bed , and ProtagonistA looked up at the ceiling with a trembling hand 
 ProtagonistA was trying to make sense of what had happened , but ProtagonistA's mind was foggy and it was hard to think straight 
 ProtagonistA looked around the room and saw that ProtagonistA was in a strange place 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was or how ProtagonistA got there 
 ProtagonistA was about to get up and try to find some answers when ProtagonistA heard a noise at the door 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
ProtagonistA had been married to ProtagonistA's husband for ten years , and they had a child together 
 But ProtagonistA had always been unhappy , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA needed to leave 
 ProtagonistA had been thinking about it for a long time , and ProtagonistA had even started packing ProtagonistA's bags 
 But ProtagonistA never could bring ProtagonistA to actually leave 
 So ProtagonistA said goodbye to ProtagonistA's husband and child , and ProtagonistA walked out the door 
 ProtagonistA was finally free to be ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was never going to look back 
 ProtagonistA was leaning against the wall , smoking a cigarette 
 ProtagonistA had a rough look about ProtagonistA , but there was something in ProtagonistA's eyes that caught my attention 
 ProtagonistA had a wild past , and ProtagonistA was currently living in the saloon because ProtagonistA had nowhere else to go 
 From that day on , ProtagonistA became a part of my life 
 ProtagonistA was my friend , my confidante , and my protector 
 ProtagonistA had never even seen a picture of them 
 ProtagonistA was just an average guy , working an average job 
 But one day , ProtagonistA took a picture of ProtagonistA that would change ProtagonistA's life forever 
 ProtagonistA had always been interested in photography , and ProtagonistA had a natural talent for it 
 But ProtagonistA never pursued it as a career , because ProtagonistA did n't think ProtagonistA could make a living doing something ProtagonistA loved 
 So ProtagonistA just took pictures as a hobby 
 But then one day , ProtagonistA took a picture of ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA loved so much , ProtagonistA decided to enter it into a contest 
 ProtagonistA started taking pictures of everything , and soon ProtagonistA's work was in high demand 
 ProtagonistA became famous for ProtagonistA's unique style , and ProtagonistA's pictures were printed in magazines all over the world 
ProtagonistA was going to have to kill ProtagonistB 
 It was nothing personal , ProtagonistA just could n't have ProtagonistB around anymore 
 ProtagonistA sat down on the arm of the chair , looking into ProtagonistB's eyes 
  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
  But ProtagonistA have to do this 
 ProtagonistA reached for the knife on the table and plunged it into ProtagonistB's chest 
 ProtagonistA cleaned up the mess and disposed of the body 
 ProtagonistA set about ProtagonistA's task with a will , and within a few weeks had found ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA had done ProtagonistA's duty , and ProtagonistA was happy to see ProtagonistB so well - matched 
 After the wedding , ProtagonistA continued to run the household for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistA was content in ProtagonistA's work 
ProtagonistA had always loved coming to the museum of ancient things 
 ProtagonistA loved to imagine what life was like in the great city of Diagona , high above the city 
 Today , ProtagonistA was lying in the museum , ProtagonistA's body neatly folded in ProtagonistA's lap 
 ProtagonistA looked up at the ceiling and imagined the city bustling with life 
 ProtagonistA could see the people walking through the streets , going about their daily lives 
 ProtagonistA could see the marketplaces , the temples , and the great palace 
 ProtagonistA could even see the dragons flying through the sky 
 ProtagonistA grew up to be a normal boy , but ProtagonistA always had a special place in ProtagonistA's heart for ProtagonistA's parents who loved ProtagonistA no matter what 
ProtagonistA was living a happy life , enjoying ProtagonistA's summer holidays with ProtagonistA's family and friends 
 One day , ProtagonistA went out to the beach with ProtagonistA's friends to play some volleyball 
 While they were playing , ProtagonistA suddenly felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's chest 
 ProtagonistA collapsed to the ground and died instantly 
One evening , when all the church bells were ringing , ProtagonistA woke in bed , as if ProtagonistA had been sleeping for hours 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and tried to piece together what had happened 
 ProtagonistA could n't have been asleep for long , because it was still light outside 
 ProtagonistA walked to ProtagonistA's window and looked out , but ProtagonistA could n't see anything because of the curtains 
 ProtagonistA walked to the living room to pull the curtains back , but when ProtagonistA got there ProtagonistA realized that the living room was empty 
 ProtagonistA was so confused 
 ProtagonistA walked around ProtagonistA's apartment , but it was completely empty 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going crazy 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB lived in a small cove along the southern shore of an old lake 
 ProtagonistA always carried around the memory of the time when ProtagonistB had cheated on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistB all over again 
ProtagonistA stood at ProtagonistA's kitchen mirror , as if looking around the room for the first time 
 ProtagonistA had just moved into this apartment and everything was still so new to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistA's reflection in the mirror and smiled 
 ProtagonistA had forgotten how good it felt 
 ProtagonistA was ready to start this new chapter in ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA was determined to make the most of it 
 ProtagonistA turned away from the mirror and walked into ProtagonistA's living room 
 ProtagonistA was going to make this space ProtagonistA's own and ProtagonistA was going to make it a place that ProtagonistA loved 
 ProtagonistA was going to make it a place where ProtagonistA could be happy 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's husband Isaac Davis were one of the first families to settle in the new town of Springfield 
One day ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's home town to go to boarding school 
 All the while ProtagonistA had a secret which ProtagonistB was in search of 
 ProtagonistA had never told anyone about this ability , not even ProtagonistA's parents , for fear of being considered a freak 
 ProtagonistA was shy and withdrawn and missed ProtagonistA's family and home terribly 
 But ProtagonistA soon made some friends and settled into a routine 
 ProtagonistA approached ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB was looking for 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but then ProtagonistA thought about how exciting it would be to use ProtagonistA's power to help someone 
 ProtagonistA agreed to help ProtagonistB , and they set off on their adventure 
ProtagonistA had been having a lot of headaches lately 
 ProtagonistA went to the doctor to see what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA was scared 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to die 
 ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA knew it was ProtagonistA's only chance 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's cousin were having lunch at the upper end of the city 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to get involved in whatever was going on 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to get involved 
 ProtagonistA just stood there , feeling like a coward 
 ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA's cousin had helped ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA wished that ProtagonistA had been brave enough to do it ProtagonistA 
Ever since the dark nights of the past , when ProtagonistA had been orphan and immature , and brought to the surface of madness by the combination of innocence with evil , the beautiful , innocent face of ProtagonistA , had been a source of terror to ProtagonistB , and perhaps to ProtagonistA , and one of the most uncertain and troublesome situations of childhood 
 As if ProtagonistA was a different person altogether 
 ProtagonistA grabbed ProtagonistB and started to strangle ProtagonistB 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA stopped strangling ProtagonistB and looked at ProtagonistB with a confused expression on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA just stood there , looking at ProtagonistB , and then ProtagonistA turned and walked out of the room 
ProtagonistA was a happy man 
 ProtagonistA loved life and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's spear 
 Every Sunday , ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistA's spear and go out into the field to hunt 
 ProtagonistA had a big belly that shook when ProtagonistA laughed , and a face that was always smiling 
 Even on this cold morning , when the sun was just starting to peek over the horizon , ProtagonistA was smiling 
 ProtagonistA knew that today was going to be a good day 
 ProtagonistA walked through the field , looking for any signs of game 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes 
 ProtagonistA tensed , preparing to throw ProtagonistA's spear 
 ProtagonistA relaxed and laughed 
 ProtagonistA had been so sure that it was going to be a deer or some other big game 
 ProtagonistA could catch one of those with ProtagonistA's bare hands 
 ProtagonistA walked over to the rabbit and picked it up 
 ProtagonistA stroked its fur for a moment before snapping its neck 
 Then ProtagonistA put the rabbit in ProtagonistA's bag and continued on ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA had enough food for the week now , and ProtagonistA was happy 
ProtagonistA was a young angel who had just recently been assigned to watch over the small town of Abirondack 
 ProtagonistA was excited to have ProtagonistA's first solo assignment and could n't wait to explore the town and meet all of the residents 
 ProtagonistA flew around the town for a few days , getting to know the layout and the people 
 ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA's favorite spot to perch on the top of one of the peaks of the Abirondack mountains 
 From ProtagonistA's vantage point , ProtagonistA could see the entire town and all of the people going about their daily lives 
 One day , as ProtagonistA was sitting on ProtagonistA's peak , ProtagonistA noticed something strange happening 
 Some of the people in town were starting to sprout wings ! ProtagonistA was shocked and confused 
 ProtagonistA had never seen anything like it before 
 ProtagonistA watched as more and more people in town grew wings 
 Some people had one pair , while others had two or even three pairs ! ProtagonistA did n't know what to make of it 
 As ProtagonistA continued to watch , ProtagonistA saw people flying around town , soaring through the air with ease 
 Then , ProtagonistA noticed that ProtagonistA's own wings were starting to disappear ! ProtagonistA panicked and flew down to the ground to see what was happening 
 ProtagonistA soon realized that as the people in town were growing wings , ProtagonistA was losing ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know why , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to accept it 
 ProtagonistA flew back to ProtagonistA's peak and watched as the people of Abirondack took to the skies , leaving ProtagonistA behind 
 ProtagonistA felt a little sad and lonely , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to be content with watching over the town from the ground 
ProtagonistA was a beautiful and purring one , with a bright , clear face and a wary look in ProtagonistA's eyes 
 ProtagonistA was always on the lookout for danger , and ProtagonistA was never afraid to take on anything that came ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA was the kind of cat that everyone wanted to be around , and ProtagonistA always made sure that everyone felt welcome in ProtagonistA's presence 
Bob was a very old and very wretched woman , and one of the most detestable characters in the country ; but in my opinion , among all women , ProtagonistA was the most infamous 
 ProtagonistA had been a prostitute for many years , and had committed every conceivable crime 
 ProtagonistA was a thief , a liar , and a cheat ; and ProtagonistA was also a murderer 
 But ProtagonistA was not content with these crimes ; ProtagonistA also used ProtagonistA's powers of witchcraft to harm people 
 ProtagonistA was a wicked old woman , and everyone in the village hated ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a bully 
 Even in death , ProtagonistA liked to terrorize the other ghosts 
 But this time , ProtagonistA had gone too far 
 ProtagonistA begged the other ghosts to stop , but they would n't 
 ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA went to the inn , ProtagonistA would most likely die in the cold and damp 
 However , ProtagonistA was not sure if it was worth it to go to ProtagonistB's house and die in the heat 
 In the end , ProtagonistA decided to go to ProtagonistB's house 
 When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistB had already passed away 
 ProtagonistA died shortly after from the heat 
ProtagonistA had once left a large sum of money and ProtagonistA's house in London for the purpose of making a new life for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had wanted a man who would be faithful to ProtagonistA in the world 
 ProtagonistA had met many men who had promised to be faithful , but they had all eventually betrayed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had almost given up hope of finding someone who would truly love ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA believed ProtagonistB and they began a life together 
 ProtagonistA was happier than ProtagonistA had ever been and ProtagonistA thought that ProtagonistB was the best thing that had ever happened to ProtagonistA 
 However , one day ProtagonistA came home and found ProtagonistB in bed with another man 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe that ProtagonistB had betrayed ProtagonistA after everything they had been through together 
 ProtagonistA left ProtagonistB and never looked back 
 ProtagonistA vowed to never trust another man again 
ProtagonistA was a mother 's lady and ProtagonistB was the nicest girl in the world 
 ProtagonistA was very proud of ProtagonistB and loved ProtagonistB very much 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to go on without ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be strong for ProtagonistA's wife and other daughter 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB would want ProtagonistA to be happy and to keep living 
 ProtagonistA lived for ProtagonistB and tried to make the best of every day 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit odd , and ProtagonistB was the only one who ever really understood ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was learning all about the Universe and how it worked 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA could understand everything and ProtagonistA was excited to share ProtagonistA's new knowledge with everyone ProtagonistA knew 
 But then , suddenly , ProtagonistA felt something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA could n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but ProtagonistA knew something was wrong with ProtagonistA's soul 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what to do or where to turn , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to find answers 
 ProtagonistA started to search for answers and eventually ProtagonistA found some comfort in religion 
 ProtagonistA started to believe that there was something bigger than ProtagonistA and that helped ProtagonistA to feel better 
 ProtagonistA slowly started to rebuild ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA is now happier than ever 
The last time they saw each other , ProtagonistA had been working on ProtagonistA's seventh year 
 ProtagonistA had stayed in touch with some of ProtagonistA's old friends from work , but ProtagonistA had n't seen them in years 
 ProtagonistA had n't seen ProtagonistB in years , but ProtagonistA had always thought of ProtagonistB fondly 
 ProtagonistA decided to go to ProtagonistB's funeral , and ProtagonistA was surprised to see how many people had turned out 
 ProtagonistA was even more surprised when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA had been feeling off for weeks , and now ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA was dying 
 ProtagonistA had never been a religious man , but ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA praying for a miracle 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to die 
 ProtagonistA heard a noise at the window and turned to see a bird flying into the room 
 ProtagonistA felt a sudden warmth in ProtagonistA's chest and knew that the bird was ProtagonistA's miracle 
 ProtagonistA sat up and the bird flew onto ProtagonistA's shoulder 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to be alright 
ProtagonistA was in the kitchen about that time , knitting a scarf for Harry , when ProtagonistA noticed a shadow sitting on the table 
 ProtagonistA did n't think much of it and went back to ProtagonistA's knitting 
 A few minutes later , ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the living room 
 ProtagonistA got up to investigate and saw the shadow sitting on the couch , watching TV 
 ProtagonistA was a little surprised , but ProtagonistA did n't say anything 
 ProtagonistA went back to the kitchen and finished knitting the scarf 
ProtagonistA had always been a bright boy 
 ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's only nephew , and ProtagonistB had always been close to ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA opened the door , ProtagonistA was shocked to see ProtagonistB's murderer standing there 
ProtagonistA was always a beautiful person , inside and out 
 So , when I had the good fortune to see ProtagonistA grow old , I was n't surprised that ProtagonistA was still as gorgeous as ever 
 ProtagonistA was like a goddess , with ProtagonistA's silver hair and wrinkle - free skin 
 ProtagonistA was always so full of life and energy , even in ProtagonistA's old age 
ProtagonistA had been walking home from work , minding ProtagonistA's own business , when ProtagonistA ran into ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA was going to die 
 ProtagonistA had never expected ProtagonistB to be anything other than a violent thug 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have found a friend in ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was grateful that their first meeting had n't ended in tragedy 
 ProtagonistA kissed me on the forehead and told me to be brave , no matter what happened 
 But through it all , ProtagonistA was there , always keeping me safe 
ProtagonistA was going to stop calling ProtagonistB  ProtagonistD ,  said ProtagonistC , though ProtagonistA did not know at the time what ProtagonistA called ProtagonistA , or what ProtagonistA regarded as ProtagonistA 
  But ProtagonistA liked ProtagonistB , despite ProtagonistB's quirks , and ProtagonistA did n't see any reason to stop calling ProtagonistB by ProtagonistD 
  ProtagonistA thought for a moment and then explained that ProtagonistB was just different from everyone else and that ProtagonistA liked ProtagonistB for that 
ProtagonistA flung open the white door of ProtagonistA's kitchen and directed ProtagonistB to the dining room 
 ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB to a seat at the table and then went back to the kitchen to finish preparing dinner 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistA came back into the room carrying a tray of food 
 ProtagonistA set it down in front of ProtagonistB and then took a seat across from ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was content to let ProtagonistB eat ProtagonistB's fill before ProtagonistA started asking questions 
 ProtagonistA listened patiently , only interjecting to ask the occasional question 
 When ProtagonistB was done eating , ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's company and showed ProtagonistB to the door 
 ProtagonistB was clearly reluctant to leave , but ProtagonistA was adamant 
 ProtagonistA said goodbye and watched as ProtagonistB walked down the path to the street 
 ProtagonistA went back inside and returned to the kitchen 
 ProtagonistA was content to have made a new friend , even if it was a bit unusual 
Not long after ProtagonistA was born , ProtagonistA had a dream 
 In the dream , ProtagonistA was standing in front of a large , imposing door 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA got there , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to go through the door 
 ProtagonistA was scared , but ProtagonistA took a deep breath and walked through 
 On the other side , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful garden 
 ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and happiness 
 ProtagonistA knew that this was ProtagonistA's true home 
ProtagonistA wanted a new car 
 ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's eye on a shiny red convertible , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to get it 
 ProtagonistA did n't have the money to buy it outright , and ProtagonistA did n't think ProtagonistA could get a loan for it 
 ProtagonistA thought about stealing it , but that was too risky 
 ProtagonistA considered asking ProtagonistA's parents for the money , but ProtagonistA did n't want to have to explain why ProtagonistA wanted a new car 
 One day , ProtagonistA saw the car parked in a lot with the keys in the ignition 
 ProtagonistA looked around to see if anyone was watching , and then ProtagonistA got in and drove off 
 ProtagonistA felt guilty , but ProtagonistA also felt excited 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to return the car before anyone noticed it was gone , but ProtagonistA could n't resist taking it for a joyride first 
 ProtagonistA drove around the city with the top down , feeling the wind in ProtagonistA's hair 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA had to take the car back 
 ProtagonistA parked it in the lot and left the keys in the ignition 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was in for a lot of trouble , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
ProtagonistA was a stranger , and a stranger that ProtagonistA was , if ProtagonistA had been anything like any other woman of flesh or blood 
 ProtagonistA came to ProtagonistB's door one day , seeking shelter from the rain 
 But one day , ProtagonistA disappeared , and ProtagonistB never saw ProtagonistA again 
 ProtagonistA was only in ProtagonistA's early 30s and was in good health 
 ProtagonistA taught me how to hunt and fish , and how to survive in the wilderness 
 ProtagonistA was a great man , and I loved ProtagonistA like a father 
Nearly two hours after ProtagonistA had set out on ProtagonistA's journey to the far - away city of S- , ProtagonistA arrived at the eastern gate of the town 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for most of the journey , as ProtagonistA's horse had been stolen shortly after ProtagonistA had set out 
 ProtagonistA was tired , hungry , and thirsty , but ProtagonistA was determined to find a way to the city 
 ProtagonistA asked the guard at the gate if there was any way ProtagonistA could get to the city , and the guard told ProtagonistA that there was a wagon that would be leaving soon 
 ProtagonistA climbed aboard and settled in for the ride 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a rebel 
 ProtagonistA was never one to follow the crowd and ProtagonistA always marched to the beat of ProtagonistA's own drum 
 ProtagonistA loved the way they looked , the way they sounded , and the way they made ProtagonistA feel 
 ProtagonistA was excited to be taking a train for the first time by ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had never been to Boston before and ProtagonistA was looking forward to exploring the city 
 ProtagonistA loved the feeling of the wind blowing through ProtagonistA's hair as the train sped down the tracks 
 ProtagonistA was in awe of the city as it whizzed by outside ProtagonistA's window 
 ProtagonistA could n't wait to get off the train and explore 
 ProtagonistA had a great time during ProtagonistA's first year in college 
 ProtagonistA would always remember the time ProtagonistA took the train by ProtagonistA to Boston 
ProtagonistA was sixteen and in love , and ProtagonistA was going to have to kill someone 
 ProtagonistA had never wanted to hurt anyone , but ProtagonistA's love for ProtagonistB was so strong that ProtagonistA would do anything for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA could n't let that happen 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB too much 
 So ProtagonistA steeled ProtagonistA for the task ahead , and on the night of the big gang showdown , ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB's father 
 And ProtagonistA would do it again in a heartbeat , if it meant that ProtagonistB could be ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was a good and kind woman , and as such ProtagonistA would not have anything to do with a sick man 
 ProtagonistA was content to live ProtagonistA's life alone , without the hassle of caring for someone else 
 However , one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA could not turn away from ProtagonistB , and so ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB in and cared for ProtagonistB 
 From then on , ProtagonistA made it ProtagonistA's mission to help as many sick people as ProtagonistA could 
ProtagonistA had been sitting in the cart behind the house for hours , but ProtagonistA had kept ProtagonistA's eyes on the horses , which were galloping along at a good clip 
 ProtagonistA had been waiting for an opportunity to escape and now ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's chance 
 ProtagonistA quickly jumped out of the cart and ran towards the horses 
 ProtagonistA was able to grab one of their tails and was pulled along behind them 
 ProtagonistA was terrified , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to hold on 
 ProtagonistA lay on the ground , panting and shaking 
 ProtagonistA was lucky to be alive 
 ProtagonistA 's tried everything to get ProtagonistB to see reason , but ProtagonistB just wo n't listen 
 ProtagonistA ca n't concentrate on anything with their constant squawking and ProtagonistA 's starting to feel like ProtagonistA 's going insane 
 One day , ProtagonistA snaps 
 ProtagonistA ca n't take it anymore and ProtagonistA starts yelling at ProtagonistB , telling ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB needs to get rid of the birds 
 ProtagonistA starts throwing things , smashing the bird cages and freeing the birds 
 ProtagonistA does n't know what to do now 
 ProtagonistA 's ruined everything and ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistB will never forgive ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA can only hope that someday ProtagonistB 'll be able to forgive ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA knows it will be a long time before that happens 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA 'd killed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 'd been planning it for weeks , ever since ProtagonistA 'd found out about ProtagonistB's dark secret 
 ProtagonistA had always been a good person , but ProtagonistA could n't let ProtagonistB's evil continue 
 So ProtagonistA snuck into ProtagonistB's chambers one night and stabbed ProtagonistB in the heart 
 ProtagonistA felt a surge of triumph as ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA 'd done the world a great service 
 But then ProtagonistB's body began to glow and ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA 'd made a mistake 
 ProtagonistA had only killed ProtagonistB's physical body - the magic inside ProtagonistB was still alive and well 
 ProtagonistA begged for forgiveness , but it was too late 
ProtagonistA stood up from ProtagonistA's chair and leaned forward , ProtagonistA's head leaning forward and ProtagonistA's hands clasped across ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA was trying to figure out what to do next 
 ProtagonistA had been sitting in ProtagonistA's chair for hours , just thinking 
 But now , ProtagonistA was ready to take action 
 ProtagonistA was going to stand up and figure out what was going on in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately 
 Then , ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's job 
 And now , ProtagonistA was facing eviction from ProtagonistA's apartment 
 ProtagonistA had nowhere to go and no one to turn to 
 But ProtagonistA was not going to give up 
 ProtagonistA was going to stand up and fight for ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was going to find a way to make things right again 
 ProtagonistA started by going to the library 
 ProtagonistA checked out books on finding a job and on starting a new life 
 ProtagonistA read them all , and then ProtagonistA started to put their advice into action 
 ProtagonistA started by looking for a new job 
 ProtagonistA applied to dozens of places , and finally , ProtagonistA got a job at a local grocery store 
 Then , ProtagonistA started to look for a new place to live 
 ProtagonistA found an apartment that ProtagonistA could afford , and ProtagonistA moved in 
 Finally , ProtagonistA started to reach out to ProtagonistA's friends and family 
 ProtagonistA was slowly getting ProtagonistA's life back on track 
ProtagonistA was in the midst of the courtyard around ProtagonistA's apartment when ProtagonistA saw a rat dart by 
 ProtagonistA was so startled that ProtagonistA jumped up and ran back inside 
ProtagonistA had always loved the sun 
 As a child , ProtagonistA would spend hours playing in the park , basking in the warm rays 
 But now , as ProtagonistA sat in ProtagonistA's garden , ProtagonistA could only think of the sun as a cruel joke 
 ProtagonistA remembered it so vividly 
 ProtagonistA had been at work , sitting in ProtagonistA's office , when ProtagonistA heard the first explosion 
 At first , ProtagonistA thought it was a thunderstorm 
 But then ProtagonistA saw the plume of smoke rising in the distance 
 ProtagonistA ran outside , and the sky was filled with planes 
 ProtagonistA could only watch in horror as the world ProtagonistA knew was being destroyed 
 ProtagonistA sat down in ProtagonistA's front - yard garden in Monument Hill , a grimy island of green , and stared into the little pool , imagining a world without a sky of silver or the blue of crimson 
ProtagonistA was overjoyed when ProtagonistA's wife gave birth to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA decided to take the day off from work to spend time with ProtagonistA's new family 
The last night ProtagonistA had been on earth , ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA grew up in a life of luxury , never wanting for anything 
 ProtagonistA attended the best schools and had the best of everything 
 As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to realize that ProtagonistA was different from other people 
 ProtagonistA did n't feel the same things that they did 
 ProtagonistA did n't care about the same things 
 ProtagonistA began to feel like ProtagonistA was living in a world that was n't meant for ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA ran away from home 
 ProtagonistA left everything behind and started a new life 
 ProtagonistA changed ProtagonistA's name and started over 
 ProtagonistA found a new group of friends who accepted ProtagonistA for who ProtagonistA was 
 And ProtagonistA finally felt like ProtagonistA belonged 
ProtagonistA had been walking along the banks of the river Thames in the company of several other persons in the neighbourhood of a certain house called the Mulhouse 
 ProtagonistA was in the possession of Mrs
 ProtagonistA had been walking with ProtagonistA and the others for some time when ProtagonistA suddenly stopped and said that ProtagonistA wanted to go back to the Mulhouse 
 ProtagonistA and the others tried to persuade ProtagonistA to continue walking with them but ProtagonistA was adamant about wanting to go back 
 ProtagonistA eventually relented and said that ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistA back to the Mulhouse 
 When they arrived at the Mulhouse , ProtagonistA went into the room where ProtagonistA had been born and sat down on the bed 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA wanted to stay there for a while and that ProtagonistA should go back to the river Thames and continue walking with the others 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA would stay with ProtagonistA but ProtagonistA insisted that ProtagonistA go 
 After a few minutes , ProtagonistA left the Mulhouse and continued walking with the others 
 Some time later , ProtagonistA came out of the Mulhouse and joined ProtagonistA and the others 
 ProtagonistA bid farewell to ProtagonistA and the others and went on ProtagonistA's way 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the bed , looking at ProtagonistA in the mirror 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about how ProtagonistA's life had turned out 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a successful businessman , but things had never quite worked out for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a dreamer , and ProtagonistA knew that had held ProtagonistA back 
 ProtagonistA had never been able to really commit to anything , and as a result , ProtagonistA had always ended up falling short 
 But now , ProtagonistA was starting to feel like maybe it was time to make a change 
 ProtagonistA was getting older , and ProtagonistA wanted to make something of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA wanted to finally achieve something 
 ProtagonistA was tired of living a life of mediocrity , and ProtagonistA was ready to start reaching for the stars 
 ProtagonistA got up from the bed and walked over to the mirror 
 ProtagonistA looked ProtagonistA in the eye and said ,  It 's time for a change 
  ProtagonistA was determined to make ProtagonistA's dreams a reality , and ProtagonistA was going to start right now 
ProtagonistA rode ProtagonistA's yellow horse through the desert , looking for any sign of life 
 ProtagonistA had been riding for days , and was getting very tired 
 Finally , ProtagonistA came to a city where old walls and towers still stood 
 ProtagonistA rode through the city , and felt like something was watching ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA rode to the center of the city , and stopped 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was being watched , but ProtagonistA could n't see anyone 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA felt something touch ProtagonistA's shoulder , and ProtagonistA turned around to see ProtagonistB standing there 
 ProtagonistA was amazed , and did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's destiny was to save the world , and ProtagonistA would do whatever it took to make sure that happened 
ProtagonistA had a long way to go to reach the point when ProtagonistA could step into the kitchen without looking over ProtagonistA's shoulder 
 ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA was tired of being afraid 
 ProtagonistA was tired of looking over ProtagonistA's shoulder all the time , and ProtagonistA was ready to take a stand 
 ProtagonistA was ready to face ProtagonistA's fears and to fight for what ProtagonistA wanted 
 ProtagonistA was ready to be the man ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could be 
ProtagonistA had been looking forward to ProtagonistB's visit all year 
 ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's only child , and ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA pushed back ProtagonistB's heavy trunk and waded through the mud to the car 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been hoping for a warm reunion , but it was clear that ProtagonistB was not happy to be there 
 ProtagonistA tried to make the best of it , but it was clear that ProtagonistB was not interested in spending time with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was going through a tough time in ProtagonistB's life 
 One day , ProtagonistA came home and found ProtagonistB in the kitchen , crying 
 ProtagonistA sat down with ProtagonistB and asked ProtagonistB what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA had had no idea 
 ProtagonistA listened as ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's struggles and ProtagonistB's fears 
 ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistB for being so brave and for opening up to ProtagonistA 
 Since that day , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB have been inseparable 
 ProtagonistA is grateful that ProtagonistB came to visit , even though it was tough at first 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistB is the most important person in ProtagonistA's life 
ProtagonistA had been dreaming for more than two years , and right now the thought that ProtagonistA would have to die thrilled ProtagonistA more than anything else 
 ProtagonistA was lying in ProtagonistA's hospital bed , hooked up to a machine that beeped with ProtagonistA's heartbeat , a reminder that ProtagonistA was still alive 
 ProtagonistA was happy to know that ProtagonistA's time was almost up 
 But against all odds , ProtagonistA had held on 
 ProtagonistA had been through chemotherapy and radiation , but nothing had worked 
 ProtagonistA was tired of fighting , tired of being in pain 
 ProtagonistA was ready to go 
 Now , as ProtagonistA lay in ProtagonistA's hospital bed , ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would be leaving this world soon and that thought filled ProtagonistA with happiness 
 ProtagonistA was ready to meet whatever comes next 
ProtagonistA's 's a bully , is n't ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistA 's always picking on kids who are weaker than ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA 's never afraid to start a fight 
 But one day , ProtagonistA went too far 
 ProtagonistA picked on a kid who was smaller than ProtagonistA , and the kid fought back 
 ProtagonistA was so surprised that ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA never picked on anyone again after that 
It was a hot day , said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA sat down at the table in the dining - room , which was in the middle of the house 
 ProtagonistA was sweating and ProtagonistA took off ProtagonistA's jacket and tie and unbuttoned ProtagonistA's shirt 
 ProtagonistA sat down and loosened ProtagonistA's belt 
 ProtagonistA was very hot and uncomfortable 
 ProtagonistA felt relieved and ProtagonistA sat back in ProtagonistA's chair and closed ProtagonistA's eyes 
ProtagonistA am a man of thirty - nine years , and a thousand and one years ago at the beginning of the twelfth century ProtagonistA , appeared in the court of the first emperor Constantine , who was a God of the Jews , and ordered the execution of four hundred and fifty - two religious and political persons 
 ProtagonistA eventually made ProtagonistA's way to the court of ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistB died , ProtagonistA retired from public life and lived out ProtagonistA's days in peace 
ProtagonistA lay on the river bank , babbling in the shallow water of the river while the great army of the Lō̏kampans swept towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to die , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA had fought bravely and killed many of the enemy , but there were just too many of them 
 As they closed in on ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and thought of ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA hoped that they would be able to escape 
In those days there was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was a good , honest man , and a man of sense , and ProtagonistA knew what was good for ProtagonistA ; and ProtagonistA was called Adam , and ProtagonistA was wise 
 And ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB's name was Eve , and ProtagonistB was a good woman , and ProtagonistB was called Eve , because ProtagonistB was the mother of all living 
ProtagonistA was a weak old man , but ProtagonistA had a good mind 
 ProtagonistA was always thinking of ways to make things better for ProtagonistA and others 
 One day , ProtagonistA came up with an invention that would help people with their daily tasks 
 ProtagonistA created a device that would allow people to do their work without having to use their hands 
 ProtagonistA was very proud of ProtagonistA's invention and ProtagonistA knew that it would make a difference in the world 
ProtagonistA was the very boss of all the soldiers , of the high school teachers , and even of the teachers ' wives 
 ProtagonistA had always said that the best way to get information out of ProtagonistB in the future was not to kill ProtagonistB , but to expose ProtagonistB , as ProtagonistB was known to the civilian world , to the light of ridicule 
 So when ProtagonistB was caught stealing a car , ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB paraded through the town square in a chicken suit 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would never want to be exposed to that kind of ridicule again , and ProtagonistB would be more likely to cooperate in the future 
In the summer of that year , 1577 , ProtagonistA wrote a letter to the Golden Bough , in the neighbourhood of Jermyn , in Yorkshire , where ProtagonistA then was living , in which ProtagonistA says:I have been thinking a great deal about our conversation the other day , and ProtagonistA have come to the conclusion that you were right and ProtagonistA was wrong 
 ProtagonistA have been living in this neighbourhood for some time , and ProtagonistA have come to know the people and the land quite well 
 And ProtagonistA must say that ProtagonistA have never seen anything like the Golden Bough 
 ProtagonistA do n't know how you do it , but everything you touch seems to turn to gold 
 ProtagonistA was a fool to think that ProtagonistA could compete with you 
 ProtagonistA see now that ProtagonistA was only deluding ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA do n't know how you do it , but ProtagonistA can see that it is something special that you have , something that ProtagonistA could never hope to match 
 ProtagonistA want to apologize for ProtagonistA's foolishness , and ProtagonistA want to thank you for your patience in dealing with ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was a fourth year Muggleborn , and had , as such , come to the city of London on the last leg of ProtagonistA's journey from the Gringotts bank 
 ProtagonistA was on the verge of turning around and going back to the safety of the bank when ProtagonistA heard a scream 
 Without thinking , ProtagonistA ran towards the sound 
 As ProtagonistA turned into the alley , ProtagonistA saw a group of men surrounding ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was just a fourth year student 
 ProtagonistA was n't a hero 
 But ProtagonistA had to do something 
 ProtagonistA stepped forward and spoke in a voice that ProtagonistA hoped was more confident than ProtagonistA felt 
 ProtagonistA reached into ProtagonistA's pocket and pulled out ProtagonistA's wand 
 ProtagonistA pointed it at the men and shouted ,  Stupefy!Nothing happened 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was in trouble now 
 But ProtagonistA had to try 
 ProtagonistA threw ProtagonistA at the nearest man , punching and kicking with all ProtagonistA's might 
 ProtagonistA tried to get up , but ProtagonistA was too weak 
 ProtagonistA tried to fight back , but it was futile 
 ProtagonistA looked up to see ProtagonistB standing over ProtagonistA , wand in hand 
 ProtagonistA tried to get up , but ProtagonistA's vision was swimming 
 ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB's voice , but ProtagonistA could n't make out the words 
The first time that ProtagonistA lived in the world , ProtagonistA was forty years old 
 ProtagonistA had never really been alive before , and ProtagonistA found the experience to be both exhilarating and terrifying 
 ProtagonistA was constantly learning new things and discovering new things about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA loved the feeling of finally being alive , but ProtagonistA was also scared of the unknown 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what the future held for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was excited to find out 
Whatever ProtagonistA was , ProtagonistA was a brilliant boy 
 ProtagonistA had a knack for math and science , and ProtagonistA always seemed to be one step ahead of ProtagonistA's classmates 
 ProtagonistA was the type of boy who always had ProtagonistB's nose in a book , and ProtagonistB was always eager to learn more 
 ProtagonistA nodded ProtagonistA's understanding , and the other students in the class began to ask their own questions 
 It was clear to everyone that ProtagonistA was a brilliant boy 
 Even when ProtagonistA 's not there , ProtagonistA can feel the presence of the house and all of the memories that it holds 
At the moment when ProtagonistA was about to collide with the ground , ProtagonistA burst through the cairn wall , leapt back , and dropped dead 
 ProtagonistA had been one of the best racers in the world , and ProtagonistA will be missed 
ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a writer 
 It was a dream ProtagonistA 'd had since ProtagonistA was a child , but ProtagonistA never thought it was something ProtagonistA could actually do 
 ProtagonistA was more than thirty - eight years old when ProtagonistA first put pen to paper and ProtagonistA knew it was something ProtagonistA was meant to do 
 ProtagonistA had always been a creative person , but ProtagonistA never thought ProtagonistA could actually make a living as a writer 
 ProtagonistA 'd been working in a boring office job for years and ProtagonistA was tired of it 
 ProtagonistA wanted to do something that ProtagonistA was passionate about 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to take the plunge and start writing 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure where to start , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to start somewhere 
 ProtagonistA wrote a short story and submitted it to a few magazines 
 ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's job and started writing full - time 
 ProtagonistA killed children and grew to be nothing less than a menace to the peace of the world 
ProtagonistA had always been a good person 
 ProtagonistA worked hard and was always kind to others 
 But ProtagonistA always felt like there was something more ProtagonistA was meant to do 
 ProtagonistA could n't quite put ProtagonistA's finger on it , but ProtagonistA knew there was something out there for ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA had a life - changing experience 
 ProtagonistA was sitting in meditation when ProtagonistA suddenly felt a presence around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA being transformed into a new being 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's body becoming lighter and ProtagonistA's mind becoming clearer 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had been transformed into something more than just a human 
 ProtagonistA was now a being of pure light and love 
 ProtagonistA now knew ProtagonistA's purpose was to help others find their own divine transformation 
ProtagonistA was a simple man 
 ProtagonistA liked to read , take care of things , and get along with people 
 ProtagonistA was content being left alone and looked after ProtagonistA's own happiness 
 ProtagonistA was content knowing ProtagonistA had a good life 
 ProtagonistA attended the Royal College of the Healing Arts in Oxford 
 After ProtagonistA graduated , ProtagonistA moved to London to help people there 
 ProtagonistA met a lot of people who were struggling and ProtagonistA helped them as much as ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA eventually became a famous healer and helped many people all over the world 
ProtagonistA was a very average looking guy 
 ProtagonistA had brown hair , brown eyes , and was of average height 
 ProtagonistA was n't particularly athletic , nor was ProtagonistA particularly smart 
 ProtagonistA was just an average guy 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to do something different 
 ProtagonistA decided to go on an adventure 
 For weeks , ProtagonistA wandered through forests and mountains , crossing rivers and streams 
 ProtagonistA met new people and saw new sights 
 ProtagonistA had the time of ProtagonistA's life 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA made it back home 
 ProtagonistA was tired , dirty , and hungry , but ProtagonistA was also happy 
 ProtagonistA had accomplished something that ProtagonistA never would have thought possible 
 ProtagonistA had gone on an adventure 
Once , ProtagonistA was n't sure ProtagonistA wanted to be a wizard and then believe what ProtagonistA was told 
 ProtagonistA went to the wizard 's academy to try it out and see if it was for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA quickly learned that being a wizard was not as easy as it looked 
 But the more ProtagonistA learned , the more ProtagonistA realized how powerful magic could be 
 ProtagonistA started to believe in the possibilities of what ProtagonistA could do with magic 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA became one of the most powerful wizards in the world 
 ProtagonistA used ProtagonistA's magic to help others and make the world a better place 
 ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had decided to become a wizard 
The next day , after ProtagonistA had sent for the servants , ProtagonistA lay down on the front steps of the Black family house and watched as ProtagonistC poured cup after cup of tea for the household and the servants 
 ProtagonistA was happy to be home 
 ProtagonistA came home ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA ca n't just come home ! ProtagonistA have to go back to the city and get a ProtagonistB was about to say more , but ProtagonistC came out and put ProtagonistC's hand on ProtagonistB's arm 
  ProtagonistA can stay here with us 
  But ProtagonistA 's going to have to get a job soon 
 ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB go , then turned to ProtagonistC 
 Thank ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistA said 
One day , when Bob was 13 and Cecil was only five , ProtagonistA took them to see the ancient statue of the Roman emperor Antonius 
 ProtagonistA told them that the emperor was a great leader and a brave warrior 
 ProtagonistA also told them that the statue was made to honor his memory 
 ProtagonistA was a short , sallow - faced young man with hair like the top of ProtagonistA's head , and a goatee as big as ProtagonistA was broad 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a black leather jacket and jeans 
 ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA was in a hurry 
 ProtagonistA did n't see me 
 ProtagonistA does n't understand why no one wants to go to the library with ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA decides to take matters into ProtagonistA's own hands 
 ProtagonistA makes a sign that says  The Library is Fun !  and ProtagonistA stands outside the library , handing out flyers to passersby 
 ProtagonistA is thrilled that ProtagonistA 's finally getting through to people 
 And ProtagonistA 's happy to have finally found a way to share ProtagonistA's love of the library with others 
 Brown , and ProtagonistB was a very good woman , and ProtagonistB managed the house very well , and ProtagonistA was very well satisfied with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA's name was Chester , and ProtagonistA was thirty - four years old 
 ProtagonistA was a big man , with a bushy beard and a hearty laugh 
 ProtagonistA loved to fish , and ProtagonistA was always the first one out on the boat 
 ProtagonistA was a good man , and ProtagonistA was loved by all who knew ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA went out fishing with ProtagonistA's friends , and ProtagonistA never came back 
 ProtagonistA was a good man , and ProtagonistA will be missed by all who knew ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been planning this for months and ProtagonistA was not going to let anything stop ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA walked calmly to the desk of ProtagonistB and pulled out a gun 
 ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB's footsteps echo down the hallway as ProtagonistB ran to get help 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA did n't have much time 
 ProtagonistA went to the first door on the left and opened it 
 ProtagonistA went to the desk and sat down in the chair 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be quick 
 ProtagonistA typed in the username and password that ProtagonistA had been given 
 Then ProtagonistA opened the file that ProtagonistA was looking for 
 ProtagonistA quickly scanned through it , looking for the information ProtagonistA needed 
 ProtagonistA found what ProtagonistA was looking for and copied it to a USB drive 
 Then ProtagonistA heard footsteps coming down the hallway 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to go 
 ProtagonistA put the USB drive in ProtagonistA's pocket and ran out of the room 
 ProtagonistA could hear the footsteps getting closer , but ProtagonistA did n't look back 
 ProtagonistA ran to the main door and opened it 
 Then ProtagonistA was outside 
 ProtagonistA ran down the street and did n't stop until ProtagonistA was safe 
 ProtagonistA had been ill for some time , and it was only a matter of time before ProtagonistA passed away 
 ProtagonistA was a good man , and ProtagonistA will be missed 
ProtagonistA had been walking ProtagonistA's entire life 
 ProtagonistA was seventeen , ProtagonistA had a job , and ProtagonistA was going to go to Hogwarts 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to be a wizard , and now ProtagonistA was finally going to get ProtagonistA's chance 
 ProtagonistA had never been very good at school , but ProtagonistA was determined to try ProtagonistA's best 
 ProtagonistA arrived at Hogwarts and was sorted into Gryffindor 
 ProtagonistA was excited to be in the same house as Harry Potter 
 ProtagonistA quickly made friends with the other students and started to enjoy ProtagonistA's classes 
 ProtagonistA was especially good at Defense Against the Dark Arts 
 ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA belonged at Hogwarts 
 ProtagonistA loved the feeling of being surrounded by magic 
 ProtagonistA even started to think that maybe , just maybe , ProtagonistA could be a great wizard one day 
When ProtagonistA left the village at seventeen years of age and started for the farm , ProtagonistA was a lanky little fellow , and although ProtagonistA was not accustomed to the rough country life and the heat of the winter , yet ProtagonistA was not destitute of good sense or good sense , however hardened and difficult this may have been for ProtagonistA ; and in these latter points ProtagonistA was very faithful indeed ; for ProtagonistA always had in ProtagonistA's mind one thing in mind ; that ProtagonistA ought to be a farmer , even though ProtagonistA might have to starve 
 ProtagonistA was often tired and hungry 
 But ProtagonistA persevered 
 ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA wanted to be a farmer , ProtagonistA had to tough it out 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA started to get the hang of things 
 ProtagonistA learned how to work the land and how to care for the animals 
 ProtagonistA even started to enjoy the simple life 
 ProtagonistA was proud of ProtagonistA's accomplishments and knew that ProtagonistA had made the right decision in leaving the village 
 Although ProtagonistA was still lanky , ProtagonistA had become a strong and capable young man 
 ProtagonistA had proven to ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could make it as a farmer 
 ProtagonistA had evidently gone mad , and the villagers were terrified 
 ProtagonistA continued ProtagonistA's rampage , killing anyone who got in ProtagonistA's way , until finally the village elder managed to calm ProtagonistA down 
Not long ago ProtagonistA came at last to ProtagonistA's senses , and thought that ProtagonistA must be out of a job 
 ProtagonistA had worked hard for years , but it seemed that ProtagonistA's efforts had gone unnoticed 
 ProtagonistA decided that it was time to make a change 
 ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's boss and handed in ProtagonistA's resignation 
 ProtagonistA's boss was surprised , but ProtagonistA was firm in ProtagonistA's decision 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA's next step would be , but ProtagonistA was ready to find out 
 ProtagonistA was ready to start fresh and finally be happy with ProtagonistA's career 
There was once a man who was well known , and known very well , for the one thing ProtagonistA had in common with every other man in the world , though ProtagonistA did not know it at the time ProtagonistA was doing what every other man in the world did , ProtagonistA had in common with the man who was named Thomas , with the same qualifications , and quite at the same time , however , ProtagonistA possessed some things which no man in the world possessed : ProtagonistA had both the good and the bad of the human species ; and there is no one who finds more good in human nature than the man who has done no other good than what ProtagonistA had done on ProtagonistA's own account , but had done it all on the goodwill of ProtagonistA's country and ProtagonistA's countrymen 
ProtagonistA was always a little too young to know what ProtagonistA really wanted , that was , except perhaps to know what ProtagonistA was really afraid of 
 ProtagonistA was afraid of the dark , of course , and of spiders , and of heights 
 What ProtagonistA was really afraid of was ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was afraid of what ProtagonistA might become if ProtagonistA ever let ProtagonistA go 
 ProtagonistA was afraid of losing control and becoming a monster 
 But one day , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA could n't keep running from ProtagonistA's fears forever 
 So ProtagonistA decided to face them head on 
 ProtagonistA went into the darkness , ProtagonistA faced ProtagonistA's fears , and ProtagonistA conquered them 
 And in doing so , ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistA was stronger than ProtagonistA ever could have imagined 
ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer 
 As a child , ProtagonistA would lie in bed at night and dream of far - off places and adventures 
 ProtagonistA would imagine ProtagonistA as a brave knight , saving a beautiful princess from a dragon , or a daring explorer , discovering new lands and treasures 
 As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to realize that life was not always like ProtagonistA's dreams 
 ProtagonistA still held on to ProtagonistA's dreams , but ProtagonistA also learned to be realistic 
 If all ProtagonistA had ever wanted was a happy ending , ProtagonistA would have taken it 
 But ProtagonistA knew that there was more to life than just happiness 
 There was adventure , and discovery , and ProtagonistA was determined to find ProtagonistA's own path in life , no matter what it took 
ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB 
 Now , as ProtagonistA watched the other kids ' jaws drop in envy , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB had been right 
When ProtagonistA was little , ProtagonistA always had a great imagination 
 ProtagonistA was always asking questions and trying to learn more about the world around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA would often go on adventures in ProtagonistA's mind , and ProtagonistA was always the hero 
 ProtagonistA never gave up , no matter how difficult the challenge 
 ProtagonistA was always determined to find the answer , and ProtagonistA always did 
ProtagonistA , of course , corrects the usual scale , does not include the perils of infancy , such as the dread of drowning ; but there is no doubt that , all things considered , ProtagonistA is an individual of prodigious intelligence 
 From the time ProtagonistA could talk , ProtagonistA was asking questions and making observations that showed ProtagonistA was far ahead of ProtagonistA's peers 
 ProtagonistA started reading early , and by the time ProtagonistA was in kindergarten , ProtagonistA was reading at a college level 
 They need n't have worried , though ; ProtagonistA was always able to hold ProtagonistA's own , whether it was in an argument or a physical fight 
 ProtagonistA skipped several grades in school , and ProtagonistA graduated from college at the age of 20 
 ProtagonistA then went on to get a PhD in physics , and ProtagonistA is now one of the leading experts in the field 
 This is not to say that ProtagonistA is unimportant , but rather that ProtagonistA's story has been told by someone who is no longer with us 
 ProtagonistA had a natural affinity for learning , and ProtagonistA excelled in ProtagonistA's studies 
 When ProtagonistA was old enough , ProtagonistA went to university and studied to become a lawyer 
 ProtagonistA was an excellent student , and ProtagonistA soon became one of the most respected lawyers in England 
 ProtagonistA was an avid sportsman , and ProtagonistA enjoyed spending time outdoors 
 ProtagonistA was also a talented musician , and ProtagonistA often played the violin in ProtagonistA's spare time 
 ProtagonistA was a kind and generous man , and ProtagonistA was always ready to help those in need 
 ProtagonistA told me that ProtagonistA could not do that , but ProtagonistA would give me the manual 
There was ProtagonistA ; or ProtagonistA was both , or neither 
 ProtagonistA was always so vague and evasive 
 ProtagonistA was like a chameleon , always changing and adaptable 
 ProtagonistA was never the same person for long 
 ProtagonistA was always an enigma , always keeping people guessing 
 ProtagonistA is a very old and very wise man who has been living on the island for many years 
 ProtagonistA knows all about the plants and animals that live there , and ProtagonistA can tell you all about the history of the island and its people 
ProtagonistA was a bad cook and a bad soldier , and ProtagonistA died of a broken heart 
 ProtagonistA was always getting into trouble and making a mess of things 
 ProtagonistA did n't care though 
 ProtagonistA was just happy to be in the army 
 But ProtagonistA fought anyway 
 ProtagonistA fought with all ProtagonistA's heart , even though ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to die 
 As ProtagonistA lay dying , ProtagonistA thought of ProtagonistA's family and how much ProtagonistA loved them 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could have been a better son and a better brother 
 ProtagonistA had loved ProtagonistB dearly , and ProtagonistB's passing had left a great hole in ProtagonistA's heart 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should get up and go home , but ProtagonistA could n't bear to leave the spot where ProtagonistB had died 
 ProtagonistA lay there for a long time , until ProtagonistA finally fell into a fitful sleep 
 ProtagonistA sat up , heart pounding , and saw a large , furry creature standing in the clearing , looking at ProtagonistA with intelligent eyes 
 ProtagonistA froze , not knowing what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't stop running until ProtagonistA was safely inside , with the door bolted shut behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA never went back to that part of the woods again , but ProtagonistA always wondered what that creature had been 
 Was it a bear ? A wolf ? Or something else entirely ? ProtagonistA would never know for sure , but the experience had left ProtagonistA with a lifelong love of animals 
ProtagonistA had a rough day 
 ProtagonistA lost ProtagonistA's wallet on ProtagonistA's way to work and had to borrow money from ProtagonistA's co - workers just to make it through the day 
 ProtagonistA was really looking forward to getting home , but when ProtagonistA got to the bus stop , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA did n't have enough money for the fare 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA explained ProtagonistA's situation and ProtagonistB offered to give ProtagonistA a penny - a - penny lift home 
 ProtagonistA was so grateful and ProtagonistA promised to pay ProtagonistB back as soon as ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA was so thankful for ProtagonistB's help and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistB's kindness 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB with all of ProtagonistA's heart 
 ProtagonistA took this to heart and made sure to always be on the lookout for anything that could make ProtagonistA some money 
 ProtagonistA was always on the lookout for deals and opportunities to make a quick buck 
ProtagonistA had left home for the first time when ProtagonistA was thirteen 
 ProtagonistA had been excited to finally be out on ProtagonistA's own and to have some adventures 
 But , ProtagonistA quickly found out that ProtagonistB was possessed 
 But , ProtagonistA soon realized that the possession had changed ProtagonistB and that ProtagonistB was now a danger to ProtagonistA and to others 
 ProtagonistA had to find a way to stop ProtagonistB and to save ProtagonistB from the possession 
For the past two weeks , ProtagonistA had been a hulking , cold - eyed thing , a monster of the Most Horrific , though some described ProtagonistA as placid 
 But ProtagonistA was not a monster , at least not anymore 
 ProtagonistA had once been a man , a husband and a father 
 Now , ProtagonistA was a shell of ProtagonistA's former self 
 ProtagonistA barely spoke , and when ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA's voice was a raspy whisper 
 ProtagonistA was a shadow of the man ProtagonistA once was 
 ProtagonistA had been out for a walk , enjoying the sunny day , when ProtagonistA was attacked 
 ProtagonistA could n't remember much of what happened , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had been bitten 
 The next thing ProtagonistA knew , ProtagonistA was waking up in a cell , chained to the wall 
 ProtagonistA was a monster , a vampire 
 But ProtagonistA was n't a monster anymore 
 And now , ProtagonistA was craving human blood 
 ProtagonistA could smell it , taste it , and it was making ProtagonistA crazy 
 But now , ProtagonistA was free 
 ProtagonistA was weak , but ProtagonistA was still able to walk 
 ProtagonistA staggered out of the cell and into the night 
 ProtagonistA staggered towards the man , ready to feast 
The summer ProtagonistA left home , ProtagonistA lost an arm 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA was going to make it through life without ProtagonistA's arm 
 ProtagonistA eventually went back to work at the sawmill , and ProtagonistA 's now doing better than ever 
ProtagonistA glared at ProtagonistB , vigorously stirring the bowl of frosting 
 ProtagonistA had the foul look of the psychotic 
 ProtagonistA would not let ProtagonistB take away ProtagonistA's happiness 
 ProtagonistA had always loved baking 
 ProtagonistA loved the way the batter came together , the way the cake rose in the oven , and the way the frosting turned out 
 ProtagonistA was always so proud of ProtagonistA's cakes 
 ProtagonistA had tried everything ProtagonistA could think of , but nothing worked 
 ProtagonistA had even asked ProtagonistB for help , but ProtagonistB had just laughed and told ProtagonistA to give up 
 But ProtagonistA was n't going to give up 
 ProtagonistA was going to find out what was wrong with ProtagonistA's cakes , and ProtagonistA was going to fix it 
 ProtagonistA jumped , and the bowl of frosting toppled over 
  ProtagonistA 've ruined ProtagonistB's cake!Bob 's face turned red with anger 
 ProtagonistA had had enough of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA picked up the bowl of frosting and threw it at ProtagonistB , hitting ProtagonistB square in the face 
 ProtagonistA went to the Fountain of the Red Gallows in west and north - east France , and there fell from the sky ten thousand pretty little green hens 
ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could get away with anything 
 ProtagonistA was a gambler and a con artist , and ProtagonistA had never been caught 
 But ProtagonistA also knew that it was n't safe to gamble away an airship 
 ProtagonistA muttered this to ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA trudged through the rush of traffic 
 ProtagonistA was regretting ProtagonistA's decision to gamble away the airship now , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistA would have to face the consequences of ProtagonistA's actions 
 ProtagonistA had been living with ProtagonistA's father since then , and though ProtagonistA was grateful for the support , ProtagonistA found the house to be incredibly lonely without ProtagonistB's presence 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB's cooking , ProtagonistB's laughter , and ProtagonistB's warm hugs 
 ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistB's old armchair , looking at old photos of ProtagonistB and trying to hold back the tears , when ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door 
 ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and was surprised to see ProtagonistC , standing on the doorstep 
 ProtagonistA invited ProtagonistC in , and they sat down in the living room and talked 
After ProtagonistA was expelled from Hogwarts , ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA's life was over 
 ProtagonistA would never be as bright as ProtagonistA's father , and as bright as ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could be 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA would never find a place in the world where ProtagonistA belonged 
 But then ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 With ProtagonistB's help , ProtagonistA became an Auror , and ProtagonistA's mother became a million miles away 
It was a short , hot afternoon at the end of August ; ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA , before the sun rose , that ProtagonistA was about to start ProtagonistA's night shift , and change ProtagonistA's clothes 
 ProtagonistA had been working the night shift for a few weeks now , and ProtagonistA was getting used to it 
 But ProtagonistA still missed the daytime 
 ProtagonistA missed the sun 
 But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to do what was best for ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA would be able to see ProtagonistA's wife and kids more during the day , and that was worth the sacrifice 
 ProtagonistA said goodbye to ProtagonistA's family and headed to work 
 ProtagonistA knew it was going to be a long night , but ProtagonistA was ready for it 
ProtagonistA first came across time travelers in the nineteen - thirties , and ProtagonistA believed they could help ProtagonistA escape from a dangerous prison 
 ProtagonistA was serving a life sentence for a crime ProtagonistA did n't commit , and ProtagonistA was desperate to get out 
 ProtagonistA asked the time travelers to take ProtagonistA back in time so ProtagonistA could change the past and prevent the crime from happening 
ProtagonistA was a simple man 
 ProtagonistA lived in a small town and worked as a farmer 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life and did n't want for anything 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out working in ProtagonistA's fields when ProtagonistA heard a strange noise 
 ProtagonistA followed the noise and it led ProtagonistA to a cave 
 Inside the cave , ProtagonistA found a creature that looked like a cross between a human and a goat 
 ProtagonistA asked the creature what was wrong and it said that it was lost and did n't know how to get home 
 ProtagonistA offered to help the creature and ProtagonistA took it back to ProtagonistA's farm 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have found a new friend and ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA could help the Reckoner find its way home 
Before ProtagonistA was a wizard , ProtagonistA had a poor childhood 
 ProtagonistA was always the last one picked for teams in school , and ProtagonistA was always the butt of jokes 
 ProtagonistA never had any friends , and ProtagonistA was always alone 
 But ProtagonistA never gave up , and ProtagonistA never stopped believing in ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA found a magic wand in the forest , and ProtagonistA became the greatest wizard in the land 
 ProtagonistA used ProtagonistA's powers to help others , and ProtagonistA made sure that everyone had a fair chance in life 
 ProtagonistA was finally happy , and ProtagonistA knew that it was all because ProtagonistA never gave up on ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was interested in the same things as ProtagonistA's brother and was happy to partake in any activities that ProtagonistA's brother enjoyed 
 ProtagonistA wanted to find ProtagonistA's own interests and hobbies , but no matter how hard ProtagonistA tried , ProtagonistA could n't seem to break away from ProtagonistA's brother 's shadow 
 With ProtagonistB's support , ProtagonistA was finally able to break free from ProtagonistA's brother 's influence and become ProtagonistA's own person 
ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistA's fair share of pain , ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA 'd been through a lot in ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA 'd never been one to shy away from a challenge 
 ProtagonistA had always been a fighter 
 ProtagonistA 'd never backed down from a fight , no matter how big or small 
 ProtagonistA was scared 
 ProtagonistA was scared of the pain , the suffering , the inevitable 
 But ProtagonistA was also scared of leaving ProtagonistA's loved ones behind 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to die , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to face the facts 
 ProtagonistA was at peace with ProtagonistA's decision 
 ProtagonistA knew it was time to let go 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA's goodbyes to ProtagonistA's loved ones and ProtagonistA went into hospice care 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be comfortable and at peace in ProtagonistA's final days 
ProtagonistA was back in the Kremlin , slinging hints at ProtagonistB and son while ProtagonistA sat in ProtagonistA's comfortable chair 
 ProtagonistA was undeterred 
 ProtagonistA continued to make suggestive comments , hoping to get a rise out of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA quickly gathered ProtagonistA's things and left , vowing never to return 
ProtagonistA had been with the family for years 
 ProtagonistA started as a young boy , working as a stable hand 
 Over time , ProtagonistA worked ProtagonistA's way up to become the head coachman 
 ProtagonistA was a fixture in the household and was well - loved by all 
 Sadly , over the years , ProtagonistA began to lose ProtagonistA's memory 
 ProtagonistA would forget things like the family 's names and ProtagonistA's duties around the house 
 ProtagonistA was sad to leave the family ProtagonistA had served for so many years , but ProtagonistA was content in ProtagonistA's new home 
 ProtagonistA loved spending time with the other servants and hearing about their lives 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have a place to call ProtagonistA's own and to be surrounded by people who loved ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was always the butt of jokes , and ProtagonistA always felt like an outsider 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided enough was enough 
 ProtagonistA was going to change ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA went to the courthouse and changed ProtagonistA's name to Robert 
 ProtagonistA felt like a new person 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA finally belonged 
 ProtagonistA always thought about that , what ProtagonistA was going to do with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA never really had a plan , but ProtagonistA always figured ProtagonistA 'd find ProtagonistA's way eventually 
 Now , here ProtagonistA was , at the age of 30 , still without a clue 
 ProtagonistA had a good job , sure , but it was n't ProtagonistA's dream job 
 ProtagonistA was n't doing what ProtagonistA loved 
 And ProtagonistA had no idea how to change that 
 ProtagonistA sighed and put the board down , getting up to pace around ProtagonistA's small apartment 
 ProtagonistA was restless , antsy , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to go crazy if ProtagonistA did n't do something soon 
 ProtagonistA would go on a journey , a journey to find ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA would leave everything behind and just go 
 It was a scary thought , but ProtagonistA was nothing if not brave 
 ProtagonistA could do this 
 ProtagonistA would do this 
 And maybe , just maybe , ProtagonistA would finally find what ProtagonistA was looking for 
ProtagonistA had been searching for ProtagonistA's mother 's house for fifteen minutes 
 ProtagonistA had been walking around the neighborhood for hours , trying to find the right street 
 Finally , ProtagonistA came to the door of ProtagonistA's mother 's house 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door , and ProtagonistA's mother answered 
 ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's everything 
 The only fault on which ProtagonistA is minded is that ProtagonistA has not yet regained the capacity of an adult man , but for whom , owing to the inherent value of youth and to ProtagonistA's own congenital beauty , the balance of society naturally imposed on ProtagonistA a certain age of vigor and of mature intellectual development 
 ProtagonistA had no education and no job skills 
 ProtagonistA drifted from one place to another , living on the streets and doing odd jobs to get by 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA worked hard and soon learned all ProtagonistA needed to know to be a successful adult 
 ProtagonistB was like a father to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was grateful for all that ProtagonistB had done for ProtagonistA 
 Thanks to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA was now a productive member of society 
ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head dismissively as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB drift into the station carriages 
 But ProtagonistA was n't going to help ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had enough problems of ProtagonistA's own 
ProtagonistA was one of the most famous and respected minds of ProtagonistA's time , but ProtagonistA was neither a man of letters nor a man of ideas 
 ProtagonistA was a man of action , and ProtagonistA's actions spoke louder than any words could have 
 ProtagonistA was a leader , and ProtagonistA inspired others to follow ProtagonistA's example 
 ProtagonistA was a doer , and ProtagonistA got things done 
 ProtagonistA was a man of ProtagonistA's word , and ProtagonistA always kept ProtagonistA's promises 
 ProtagonistA was a man of integrity , and ProtagonistA always did what ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA would do 
 ProtagonistA was a man of principle , and ProtagonistA always stood up for what ProtagonistA believed in 
 ProtagonistA was a man of courage , and ProtagonistA was never afraid to take on a challenge 
 ProtagonistA was a man of vision , and ProtagonistA always saw the potential in others 
 ProtagonistA was a man of wisdom , and ProtagonistA always knew what was best for those around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a man of love , and ProtagonistA always put others first 
 ProtagonistA was one of the most famous and respected minds of ProtagonistA's time , and ProtagonistA will always be remembered for ProtagonistA's greatness 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was suspicious of ProtagonistB because ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB was either a prostitute or an insane person 
 ProtagonistA did n't like either of them , so ProtagonistA walked away 
ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA does n't have time to explain 
 ProtagonistA 's a busy man and ProtagonistA 's got places to be 
 ProtagonistA sighed 
 ProtagonistA knew I would n't let up until ProtagonistA told me 
  Okay ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 'll tell you 
 And then ProtagonistA told me ProtagonistA's secret 
  ProtagonistA 're doing the right thing 
 ProtagonistA nodded 
  ProtagonistA know ,  ProtagonistA said 
 But ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistB would never admit it 
 ProtagonistA had been living on the streets of London for years , and ProtagonistA knew how to take care of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was a good kid , despite ProtagonistB's circumstances , and ProtagonistA wanted to help ProtagonistB however ProtagonistA could 
 Tonight , ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB pickpocket a wealthy - looking woman on the street 
 ProtagonistA had been about to intervene , but then ProtagonistA saw the gleam in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB needed the money more than the woman did , and so ProtagonistA let ProtagonistB go 
 Now , as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB run away , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had made the right decision 
 And ProtagonistA knew that , given time , ProtagonistB would make it on the streets just like ProtagonistA had 
 ProtagonistA was always courteous and considerate , never failing to go out of ProtagonistA's way to make sure that ProtagonistA's guests were comfortable and happy 
 ProtagonistA was a true gentleman in every sense of the word 
 ProtagonistA was a strange looking man , with a long beard and wild hair 
 ProtagonistA wore a tunic of animal skin and carried a large sword 
 ProtagonistA did not look like a king , or a lord , or even a knight 
 ProtagonistA looked like a barbarian 
 ProtagonistA stepped forward and spoke in a deep , booming voice 
  ProtagonistA am Bob , the warrior from the north 
 ProtagonistA have come to help King Arthur in his fight against the Saxons 
 ProtagonistA am a mighty warrior , with the strength of ten men 
 ProtagonistA will help you defeat the Saxons and drive them out of Britain 
 ProtagonistA would help them drive the Saxons out of Britain and make King Arthur 's dream of a united Britain a reality 
ProtagonistA had been the last of the contestants , but ProtagonistA 'd won 
 ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA 'd finally won something after years of entering contests and never winning 
 ProtagonistA was especially happy because ProtagonistA 'd won a trip to the Bahamas 
 ProtagonistA was going to be able to spend a week in the sun , relaxing and enjoying ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was going to make sure that ProtagonistA took advantage of every minute of ProtagonistA's trip 
ProtagonistA had always loved the rain 
 As a child , ProtagonistA would run outside and dance in the rain , spinning and twirling until ProtagonistA was soaked through to the bone 
 ProtagonistA loved the feeling of the rain on ProtagonistA's skin , the way it made ProtagonistA's hair stick to ProtagonistA's forehead and ProtagonistA's clothes cling to ProtagonistA's body 
 Now , as an adult , ProtagonistA still loved the rain 
 But ProtagonistA no longer ran outside and danced in it 
 Instead , ProtagonistA sat by the window and watched as the raindrops fell , each one making a different pattern on the glass 
 It was a rainy Saturday afternoon in September , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA thinking about the house ProtagonistA had lived in when ProtagonistA was a child 
 ProtagonistA remembered the ghost house ProtagonistA had seen in the woods and the tall , lopsided tree ProtagonistA had dreamed of jumping from 
 ProtagonistA also remembered the moon floating in the sky on that rainy night so long ago 
 ProtagonistA sighed and stood up , stretching ProtagonistA's arms above ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA was about to go make ProtagonistA a cup of tea when ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door 
 ProtagonistA opened it to find ProtagonistB , standing on the doorstep with an umbrella 
 ProtagonistA smiled back and invited ProtagonistB inside 
 ProtagonistA was glad for the company on this rainy day 
Unlike many high - class accountants in Paris , who ride in on a camel , or even a donkey , which is considerably larger , and which is slower than the standard coach , ProtagonistA rarely rode a mule , and ProtagonistA was very glad when ProtagonistA did ride a mule , because it enabled ProtagonistA to do all kinds of things within the limits of ProtagonistA's strength 
 On the day that ProtagonistA rode ProtagonistA's mule into the city , ProtagonistA was able to get a seat on the top of a double - decked bus , which was something that ProtagonistA had never been able to do before 
By the time ProtagonistA was twelve , ProtagonistA was already thinking about winning the Quidditch World Cup 
 ProtagonistA had seen the Cup many times before , but never up close 
 ProtagonistA would imagine ProtagonistA lifting the Cup above ProtagonistA's head , surrounded by ProtagonistA's teammates and the cheering crowd 
 One day , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA's parents about ProtagonistA's dream 
 ProtagonistA did n't give up though 
 ProtagonistA started practicing Quidditch in the backyard and became the captain of ProtagonistA's school team 
 By the time ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA was one of the best Quidditch players in the world 
 ProtagonistA led ProtagonistA's team to the Quidditch World Cup final , where they faced their biggest rivals 
 In a thrilling match , ProtagonistA scored the winning goal , and the Cup was finally ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA is a very important part of a man 's life , and without ProtagonistA , a man would not be complete 
 ProtagonistA is the one who gives a man his strength , his power , and his ability to love 
 ProtagonistA is the one who makes a man a man 
ProtagonistA had no name , and no business of ProtagonistA's own , but ProtagonistA had been told many a great lie , and none of them made a hair 's breadth more certain 
 ProtagonistA had been told that ProtagonistA was special , that ProtagonistA was destined for greatness , that ProtagonistA was the chosen one 
 But ProtagonistA was just a man , and all men are destined to die 
 ProtagonistA had no name , but ProtagonistA had a purpose 
 ProtagonistA was going to find ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was going to make ProtagonistB pay 
ProtagonistA had been through a lot in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA had been in more wars than ProtagonistA could count and had seen more death than anyone should have to see 
 But , somehow , ProtagonistA always managed to come out alive 
 ProtagonistA had seen a lot of death , but the one that always stuck with ProtagonistA was the death of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA never forgave ProtagonistA for not being able to save ProtagonistB 
 After the war , ProtagonistA tried to put ProtagonistA's life back together 
 ProtagonistA got a job and got married 
 ProtagonistA had a family and was happy for a time 
 ProtagonistA would have nightmares and would wake up in a cold sweat 
 ProtagonistA should have saved ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had never thought that ProtagonistA might one day make it to the top of Death 
 ProtagonistA had never been a particularly athletic person , and the thought of climbing up the sheer face of the mountain was daunting 
 But one day , ProtagonistA decided to give it a try 
 ProtagonistA started off slow , but soon found ProtagonistA making good progress 
 With each step , ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's confidence grow 
 ProtagonistA had never thought that ProtagonistA could do it , but ProtagonistA had 
ProtagonistA was driving up the hill when ProtagonistA drove ProtagonistA's horse into a deep ravine 
 ProtagonistA tried to help the horse , but it was too late 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a troublemaker , but ProtagonistB had always been there to help ProtagonistA out 
 ProtagonistA had gotten involved with some shady characters and ProtagonistB was worried ProtagonistA was going to get hurt 
 ProtagonistA finally agreed and ProtagonistB breathed a sigh of relief 
ProtagonistA was always a studious boy , and ProtagonistA loved nothing more than spending time in ProtagonistA's large library 
 ProtagonistA would often spend hours in there , reading all the books ProtagonistA had on medical topics , as well as all the other books ProtagonistA had in ProtagonistA's room 
 ProtagonistA loved learning new things , and the library was ProtagonistA's favorite place to do it 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's library , ProtagonistA came across a book that ProtagonistA had never seen before 
 ProtagonistA was curious , so ProtagonistA opened it up and started reading 
 ProtagonistA was amazed at what ProtagonistA found inside 
 ProtagonistA continued to read the book , and ProtagonistA learned more and more each day 
 ProtagonistA became an expert on many topics , and ProtagonistA even started teaching other people what ProtagonistA had learned 
ProtagonistA had been fighting the Black Council for years 
 ProtagonistA had finally tracked them down to their castle and was ready to take them on 
 ProtagonistA quickly dispatched them all and took control of the castle 
ProtagonistA had been very quiet all morning , but when ProtagonistA woke up it was to breathe the first sound of life 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and went to the window , where ProtagonistA saw the sun shining and the birds singing 
 ProtagonistA smiled and went downstairs to start ProtagonistA's day 
 ProtagonistA was more than happy to oblige and set to work immediately 
 ProtagonistA wrote a beautiful letter , full of kind words and compliments 
 ProtagonistA expressed ProtagonistA's hope that ProtagonistB was well and that they might meet again soon 
 ProtagonistA signed off with ProtagonistA's best wishes and love 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would be touched by ProtagonistA's letter and that it would make ProtagonistB's day 
ProtagonistA came to a house on a river that was looming ominously before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA walked up to the door and knocked 
 ProtagonistA knocked again , harder this time 
 ProtagonistA tried the door handle , and to ProtagonistA's surprise , it turned 
 ProtagonistA slowly pushed the door open , half expecting something to jump out at ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA cautiously stepped inside 
 ProtagonistA called out , but there was no response 
 ProtagonistA began to explore the house , and as ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA felt a presence following ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around , but there was nothing there 
 ProtagonistA tried to shake off the feeling and continued exploring 
 ProtagonistA eventually made ProtagonistA's way to the basement , where ProtagonistA found a door that was slightly ajar 
 ProtagonistA pushed it open and walked inside 
 ProtagonistA took a few steps forward , and then ProtagonistA felt something wrap around ProtagonistA's leg and pull ProtagonistA into the darkness 
ProtagonistA had brought home three sets of glasses and a large enough bag to keep them all , an obvious precaution since there was no way of knowing what ProtagonistA 'd be up against , especially when ProtagonistA was n't simply playing chess or poker or bowling 
 ProtagonistA was , after all , going to be a contestant on the new game show ,  The Maze 
 ProtagonistA had been preparing for the show for weeks , watching previous episodes and studying the layout of the maze 
 ProtagonistA was confident that ProtagonistA could win 
 ProtagonistA could hear the other contestants behind ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA did n't want to waste time looking for them 
 ProtagonistA continued to move forward , but it felt like ProtagonistA was going in circles 
 ProtagonistA was starting to get tired and frustrated 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up , but then ProtagonistA remembered the prize 
 ProtagonistA was n't going to let someone else win 
 ProtagonistA started running , and eventually ProtagonistA found the exit 
 ProtagonistA had won the game 
As ProtagonistA thought , ProtagonistA lifted ProtagonistA's head up to look around ProtagonistA's bright blue house 
 And for a moment , ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA saw a long , dark , empty room , with little else than a door and a rickety stove 
 But then ProtagonistA blinked and the room was gone , replaced by ProtagonistA's usual cozy living room 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head , wondering if ProtagonistA was just imagining things 
ProtagonistA left the room and an amount of time must have elapsed since ProtagonistA had entered the room 
 ProtagonistA had dismissed the servants and had placed ProtagonistA's hand upon the double door , and had raised it slightly , so as to let the light of the morning through 
 ProtagonistA had wanted to be alone and think about what ProtagonistA was going to do next 
 ProtagonistA was getting too old for this life and ProtagonistA wanted out 
 ProtagonistA wanted to retire and live in peace 
 But ProtagonistA knew that was not going to happen 
 ProtagonistA was going to have to go out with a bang 
 ProtagonistA was going to have to go out in style 
 ProtagonistA was going to have to go out with a big explosion 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the barn , looking out over the field where ProtagonistB had once settled cattle 
 ProtagonistA was doing ProtagonistA's best , but it was hard work 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistB and the good times they had had on the farm 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was doing what ProtagonistB would want ProtagonistA to do 
 ProtagonistA was keeping the farm going and making it successful 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the barn 
 ProtagonistA got up to investigate , and ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC in the barn 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to see a cow in the barn , but ProtagonistA was n't worried 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistC was harmless 
 ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistA's seat in the barn and continued to think about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had the farm , and ProtagonistA was proud to be able to continue ProtagonistB's legacy 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a morbid person , and the thought of ProtagonistA's own death had always intrigued ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had never been afraid of death , but ProtagonistA was curious about what it would be like 
 ProtagonistA wondered if it would be quick and painless , or if it would be slow and agonizing 
 ProtagonistA wondered if ProtagonistA would see a bright light or if everything would just go black 
 ProtagonistA wondered if ProtagonistA would be conscious of ProtagonistA's own death or if it would just happen in an instant 
 ProtagonistA thought about all the things ProtagonistA would miss if ProtagonistA died tomorrow 
 ProtagonistA would miss ProtagonistA's family and friends , of course , but ProtagonistA would also miss all the little things in life that ProtagonistA took for granted 
 ProtagonistA would miss the feeling of the sun on ProtagonistA's skin , the taste of good food , the sound of laughter 
 ProtagonistA thought about all the things ProtagonistA had yet to do in life and felt a pang of regret 
 ProtagonistA had n't traveled as much as ProtagonistA wanted to , ProtagonistA had n't written that book ProtagonistA always said ProtagonistA would , ProtagonistA had n't told the people ProtagonistA loved how much ProtagonistA loved them 
 If ProtagonistA died tomorrow , ProtagonistA would die with regrets 
 But ProtagonistA also would die with a sense of peace , knowing that ProtagonistA had lived ProtagonistA's life to the fullest 
Not long after ProtagonistA had finished ProtagonistA's story ProtagonistA heard a voice speak from the woods 
 I know ProtagonistA killed those people 
 ProtagonistA knew there was no escaping the voice 
 ProtagonistA was going to have to face ProtagonistA's crimes 
ProtagonistA had just sat down in ProtagonistA's study at Hogwarts when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB staring at ProtagonistA with a look of wonder and admiration 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what to make of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA strangely drawn to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but wonder what ProtagonistB was thinking 
 Was ProtagonistB admiring ProtagonistA's intelligence ? ProtagonistA's magical abilities ? Or was ProtagonistB simply amazed by the fact that ProtagonistA was a wizard?Whatever the reason , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel flattered by ProtagonistB's attention 
 ProtagonistA smiled at ProtagonistB and gave ProtagonistB a small nod of acknowledgement before returning to ProtagonistA's thoughts 
ProtagonistA was only six years old when ProtagonistB died in a car crash 
 ProtagonistA remembered it vividly 
 ProtagonistA remembered how ProtagonistB's body was mangled and twisted in the wreckage 
 ProtagonistA remembered how ProtagonistB screamed for help , but no one came 
 ProtagonistA remembered how ProtagonistB begged for ProtagonistA to save ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA could n't 
 ProtagonistA was too young and too weak 
 All ProtagonistA could do was watch as ProtagonistB died 
ProtagonistA was reading a book to ProtagonistA's son when ProtagonistA noticed that no one else in the room seemed to be reading 
 ProtagonistA walked over to the book shelf and saw that there were no other books there 
  ProtagonistA do n't think anyone else here has the same idea ,  ProtagonistA said as ProtagonistA stood up and walked back to ProtagonistA's seat 
ProtagonistA was a black - haired , skinny thirteen - year - old boy , who , like so many other young people in the late nineteenth century , was surprised to find out that ProtagonistA was going to be a man , and to live a long , long life 
 ProtagonistA had always thought that ProtagonistA would die young , like ProtagonistA's father and grandfather before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was not sure what to make of it , but ProtagonistA was excited for the adventure that awaited ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was warm , the yellow sunflower in ProtagonistA's hair , and ProtagonistA was silent all the while 
 ProtagonistA was thinking of ProtagonistA's life and how it had led ProtagonistA to this moment 
 ProtagonistA was thinking of the people ProtagonistA had loved and lost , and of the ones ProtagonistA still had 
 ProtagonistA was thinking of the choices ProtagonistA had made and how they had led ProtagonistA to this moment 
 ProtagonistA was at peace with ProtagonistA and with the world 
 With the help of a certain lady whom ProtagonistA had known before , ProtagonistA was able to escape ProtagonistA's sentence 
 ProtagonistA and the lady fled to a nearby town where they were able to start a new life together 
 ProtagonistA was happy to oblige 
ProtagonistA laid down in the bed and sank down to the level of ProtagonistA's knees 
 ProtagonistA could feel the mattress depress under ProtagonistA's weight and the springs start to give 
 ProtagonistA could feel the vibrations running through ProtagonistA's body and ProtagonistA knew that something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA tried to scream for help but no sound would come out 
ProtagonistA had known nothing but blows from the very beginning , even before ProtagonistA became a hydra 
 When ProtagonistA became a teenager , ProtagonistA ran away from home and joined a gang 
 ProtagonistA became one of the gang 's most ruthless members , and ProtagonistA loved the thrill of the fight 
 ProtagonistA should have died , but somehow ProtagonistA survived 
 When ProtagonistA woke up from ProtagonistA's coma , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA had been transformed into a hydra 
 ProtagonistA had multiple heads , and each one of them had a different weapon 
 ProtagonistA was now the most powerful gangster in the city , and ProtagonistA loved it 
 ProtagonistA would use ProtagonistA's new powers to take down ProtagonistA's enemies , and ProtagonistA would never let anyone get the better of ProtagonistA again 
ProtagonistA was a skilled lover , and ProtagonistA knew exactly how to get ProtagonistB pregnant 
 So ProtagonistA seduced ProtagonistB , and got ProtagonistB pregnant 
 So ProtagonistA became a husband , and a father 
 And ProtagonistA hated every minute of it 
 But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to keep up the act , for the sake of ProtagonistA's child 
ProtagonistA was a man of fifty - one years of age , but more than half a century dead , and turning over in ProtagonistA's grave , ProtagonistA was beginning to remember ProtagonistA's youth as though it had happened yesterday 
 ProtagonistA remembered the day ProtagonistA met ProtagonistA's wife , the day ProtagonistA's first child was born , and the day ProtagonistA retired from ProtagonistA's job 
 ProtagonistA even remembered the day ProtagonistA died , although that was a bit hazy 
 ProtagonistA was dead and buried , and ProtagonistA's family was long gone 
ProtagonistA was an old man when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been a doctor ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA had retired years ago 
 ProtagonistA decided to help ProtagonistB by giving ProtagonistB a place to stay when ProtagonistB was in town 
When ProtagonistA fell seriously ill , ProtagonistA , in the first months of the nineteenth century , had it in ProtagonistA to believe that ProtagonistA owed ProtagonistA's life to the kindness of an old teacher 
 When the old teacher died , ProtagonistA was so grateful that ProtagonistA decided to write a book about his life 
ProtagonistA looked across the lake from the ship at the end of the wooden deck , which allowed ProtagonistA to see the grass and all the trees 
 ProtagonistA felt so peaceful and happy at that moment , ProtagonistA forgot all about ProtagonistA's troubles 
 ProtagonistA was just happy to be alive and to be able to see such a beautiful sight 
ProtagonistA had always been interested in medicine , even from a young age 
 ProtagonistA was very successful in ProtagonistA's new career and was able to help a lot of people 
 ProtagonistA was very happy with ProtagonistA's new profession and was able to live a comfortable life 
When ProtagonistA dies ProtagonistA truly dies 
 ProtagonistA is reluctant to leave this life behind but ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA must 
 ProtagonistA says goodbye to ProtagonistA's grandparents and enters the light 
ProtagonistA was dead , but ProtagonistA was gone : how could ProtagonistA have known that ProtagonistA was dead ? ProtagonistA had died in ProtagonistA's sleep , peacefully and without pain 
 But when ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a dark place 
 ProtagonistA could n't see anything , and ProtagonistA could n't move 
 ProtagonistA tried to call out , but no sound came from ProtagonistA's mouth 
 ProtagonistA was scared and alone 
 ProtagonistA walked towards it , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA could hear voices 
 ProtagonistA could n't make out what they were saying , but ProtagonistA knew that they were beckoning ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA reached for the door handle , and as ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA woke up 
ProtagonistA was not an expert in the art of voyaging , or even in navigation , but ProtagonistA was , however , an expert in sea - craft ; and ProtagonistB , was the same man who had made the first voyage , and had already brought with ProtagonistB , in consequence of curiosity and for infinite profit , a great quantity of useful knowledge and valuable experience , among which ProtagonistB had acquired , in a short time , because ProtagonistB had been accustomed to keep the knowledge of distant places in ProtagonistB's head , and had believed that ProtagonistB was always to find some necessary article for ProtagonistB's use in some remote corner of the earth , which ProtagonistB had come upon without any knowledge whatever of the locality 
Just before ProtagonistA was to die , ProtagonistA was surprised to find ProtagonistA at a loss for words 
 ProtagonistA had always been a man of many words , never at a loss for something to say 
 But in ProtagonistA's final moments , as ProtagonistA looked back on ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA speechless 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and took ProtagonistA's final breath , regretful that ProtagonistA had never found the words to truly express ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA spent ProtagonistA's time reading , writing , dancing , or doing other things that were more likely to bring ProtagonistA into the world and bring ProtagonistA pleasure 
 ProtagonistA was a happy man , content with ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA's place in the world 
 ProtagonistA did n't need much , just a few good books , a pen and paper , and some music to dance to 
 ProtagonistA was always moving , always changing , and always growing 
 ProtagonistA was a man who loved life and lived it to the fullest 
ProtagonistA was watching ProtagonistA's sister 's boy when ProtagonistA said ,  But for the unavoidable circumstance of striking ProtagonistA's beloved infant with ProtagonistA's hammer , ProtagonistA should have had the satisfaction of buying it at a reduced price 
  ProtagonistA was very upset about striking the infant and regretted that ProtagonistA had n't been able to buy the infant at a reduced price 
 ProtagonistA never really understood what ProtagonistB meant , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA did n't want to be like ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be ProtagonistA's own man , with ProtagonistA's own mind and ProtagonistA's own purpose 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could never be the man ProtagonistB wanted ProtagonistA to be , but ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA did n't want to be like ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA could have used that money to live a comfortable life , but ProtagonistA decided to use it to make a difference in the world 
 ProtagonistA started a foundation to help people who were in need , and ProtagonistA dedicated ProtagonistA's life to helping others 
ProtagonistA did not like the way ProtagonistA looked 
 ProtagonistA was overweight and out of shape 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA needed to make a change , but ProtagonistA did n't know where to start 
 One day , ProtagonistA saw a commercial for a new gym that had just opened up in town 
 ProtagonistA decided to give it a try 
 ProtagonistA was nervous at first , but the staff made ProtagonistA feel welcome 
 ProtagonistA started going to the gym every day and working out 
 ProtagonistA changed ProtagonistA's diet and started to lose weight 
 ProtagonistA felt better than ProtagonistA had in years 
 ProtagonistA was happy to help 
 ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's calling 
 ProtagonistA was just there , taking up space and being ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was just one of those people who you do n't really think about one way or the other 
ProtagonistA had been dealing with ProtagonistB for weeks , and ProtagonistA was getting tired of it 
 ProtagonistA had had enough 
 So , when ProtagonistA sat down to read from the Book of the Law , ProtagonistA did so with the intention of banishing ProtagonistB once and for all 
 ProtagonistA focused all of ProtagonistA's energy on the words on the page , and as ProtagonistA read , ProtagonistA could feel the power of the book flowing through ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA did n't back down 
 ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief 
 Finally , ProtagonistA was free from ProtagonistB's clutches 
 And ProtagonistA had the Book of the Law to thank for it 
ProtagonistA was always telling stories to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA would make up wild adventures about space and time , always holding out ProtagonistA's pinky index finger , which ProtagonistA dubbed  super - power  , to ProtagonistB 
 One day , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA's stories could be real 
 ProtagonistA thought for a moment and then agreed 
 But ProtagonistA was nowhere to be found 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's stories could come true !  ProtagonistA said 
In the year of our Lord 1184 , ProtagonistA received a letter written by ProtagonistA's friends in which they congratulated ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's success in a certain career in which ProtagonistA had been offered a fortune 
 ProtagonistA was overjoyed to receive the letter and thanked ProtagonistA's friends for their kind words 
 ProtagonistA was especially grateful to them for their support during ProtagonistA's difficult times 
ProtagonistA set out for the farm at the end of the summer to take ProtagonistA's share of the stock ProtagonistA had bought with ProtagonistB's money , which , in the course of the last year , had increased to three millions of dollars , and which , at the time that Mr
 So ProtagonistA went with ProtagonistB 
There was once ProtagonistA , no matter what ProtagonistA tried to do in life , ProtagonistA just could n't seem to get ahead 
 ProtagonistA had a good job , but ProtagonistA's bills always seemed to pile up 
 ProtagonistA tried to get promotions , but ProtagonistA's boss always found a way to pass ProtagonistA over 
 It seemed like no matter what ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA just could n't catch a break 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided ProtagonistA 'd had enough 
 ProtagonistA went into ProtagonistA's boss 's office and quit ProtagonistA's job 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA's boss that ProtagonistA was done with always being passed over and done with always struggling to make ends meet 
 ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things and left 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get away from ProtagonistA's old life 
 ProtagonistA hitchhiked ProtagonistA's way out of town and started walking 
 ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was going , but ProtagonistA figured that anywhere was better than where ProtagonistA had been 
 ProtagonistA walked for days , until ProtagonistA finally came to a small town 
 ProtagonistA did n't know anyone there , but ProtagonistA figured ProtagonistA could start over 
 ProtagonistA got a job at the local grocery store and started to make a new life for ProtagonistA 
 It was n't easy , but ProtagonistA was finally happy 
 ProtagonistA had left ProtagonistA's old life behind and was finally starting to make something of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was finally happy and content 
When the day of a third world war comes , ProtagonistA has ProtagonistA's minders ready to give ProtagonistA permission to start it 
ProtagonistA blinked , now that ProtagonistA had fully recovered from the overwhelming sense of relief during the dance as the nine people who had been invited to the ball had all been eliminated , and ProtagonistA was sitting with ProtagonistA's back arched and ProtagonistA's head hanging down , and ProtagonistA thought for a moment about what ProtagonistA was going to say in the next few moments 
  ProtagonistA had a great time tonight , but ProtagonistA do n't think we 're compatible 
  ProtagonistA could see the hurt in ProtagonistA's eyes , but ProtagonistA knew that it was for the best 
ProtagonistA had promised to give ProtagonistB a birthday party , and Dave had laid it all out for ProtagonistA 
 It was a perfect day , and ProtagonistA was so glad ProtagonistA could make ProtagonistB's birthday so special 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an oddball 
 ProtagonistA was never quite sure how old ProtagonistA was , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was old 
 ProtagonistA had lived in a certain house in the churchyard when ProtagonistA was six or seven , and ProtagonistA had been dead for quite some time now 
 ProtagonistA was curious to know what it was like to be dead 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a daredevil , and ProtagonistA was always up for a challenge 
 ProtagonistA died on a Tuesday 
 ProtagonistA had been out walking in the churchyard , and ProtagonistA slipped and fell on a gravestone 
 ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistA's head on the stone and died instantly 
 ProtagonistA looked down and saw ProtagonistA's dead body lying on the ground 
 ProtagonistA was a bit shocked at first , but ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA was dead 
 ProtagonistA woke up and sat up , and ProtagonistA was surprised to find that ProtagonistA was alive 
 ProtagonistA had experienced death , and ProtagonistA had come back to life 
 ProtagonistA was a changed man , and ProtagonistA had a new appreciation for life 
 From then on , ProtagonistA vowed to live each day to the fullest 
The first time I met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was walking along the banks of the Ostrich in the same town where ProtagonistA had been born and high - born and had been living a long life , old and gray and in love 
 ProtagonistA told me that ProtagonistA loved the river and the way it always looked the same , no matter what time of day or year it was 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had been walking along it since ProtagonistA was a young boy and that it was always a peaceful place for ProtagonistA 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA was a wise and kind man , and I felt lucky to have met ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA came on slowly , but ProtagonistA was vigorous and determined 
 ProtagonistA had been planning this for months , and ProtagonistA was finally ready 
 ProtagonistA had all the supplies ProtagonistA needed , and ProtagonistA knew the route ProtagonistA was going to take 
 ProtagonistA started out early in the morning , before the sun was up 
 ProtagonistA wanted to get as much of the journey done before it got too hot 
 ProtagonistA was carrying a heavy backpack , and ProtagonistA was already getting tired 
 But ProtagonistA pushed on , knowing that ProtagonistA could rest when ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistA's destination 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting thirsty 
 ProtagonistA stopped to rest in the shade of a tree and drink some water 
 As the sun started to set , ProtagonistA finally arrived at ProtagonistA's destination 
 ProtagonistA was exhausted , but ProtagonistA had made it 
 ProtagonistA set up ProtagonistA's camp and crawled into ProtagonistA's sleeping bag , feeling relieved and proud of ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had not expected to get anything from this world , but ProtagonistA had not been particularly surprised , either 
 ProtagonistA had lived a long and full life , and ProtagonistA was ready to go 
 So when ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA was not surprised to find ProtagonistA in the afterlife 
 ProtagonistA was , however , surprised to find that ProtagonistA was not alone 
 ProtagonistA was happy to be there , too 
 It was a beautiful day outside , and ProtagonistA was excited to spend the day with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA could see the joy in ProtagonistB's eyes as ProtagonistB spoke , and it made ProtagonistA feel happy to know that ProtagonistA was able to share this experience with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA quickly got out ProtagonistA's fishing gear and set up ProtagonistA's station 
 It was the best day ProtagonistA had had in a long time , and ProtagonistA was grateful to have such a special connection with ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a legend among men 
 When ProtagonistA finished ProtagonistA's career , ProtagonistA had no difficulty in obtaining a place of honour 
 ProtagonistA saw the rows of bodies , each one covered in a white sheet 
 ProtagonistA felt a shiver run down ProtagonistA's spine , but ProtagonistA did n't turn away 
 ProtagonistA walked slowly down the aisle , looking at each body 
 ProtagonistA felt a sudden urge to leave , and ProtagonistA quickly walked out of the room 
ProtagonistA could nt have been more than ten years old when ProtagonistA rose to break ProtagonistA's neck in the family crypt 
 ProtagonistA had been playing with ProtagonistA's friends in the graveyard when they dared ProtagonistA to go into the crypt 
 ProtagonistA was nt scared of anything and so ProtagonistA went into the crypt 
 Once inside , ProtagonistA felt something cold and slimy wrap around ProtagonistA's neck 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's living room , listening to the sound of the children playing flute 
 ProtagonistA had been feeling down lately , and the music was a welcome distraction 
 However , as ProtagonistA listened , ProtagonistA began to feel a sense of inspiration come over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA could n't explain it , but ProtagonistA suddenly felt motivated to get up and start working on ProtagonistA's latest project 
 ProtagonistA had been struggling with it for weeks , but now ProtagonistA felt confident that ProtagonistA could finish it 
 Thanking the children for their music , ProtagonistA got up and went to ProtagonistA's studio to start working 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life , but always felt there was something more out there for ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to take a walk and see what the world had to offer 
 ProtagonistA walked for miles and miles , until ProtagonistA came to a large city 
 ProtagonistA was amazed by the sights and sounds of the city , and decided to explore it further 
 ProtagonistA walked for hours , until ProtagonistA came to a large park 
 In the park , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on a bench 
 ProtagonistA went over to talk to ProtagonistB , and they hit it off immediately 
 ProtagonistA went home that night feeling excited about the possibilities that life had to offer 
ProtagonistA 's not even ProtagonistB's father anymore , ProtagonistA croaked 
 ProtagonistA had maybe a month , maybe less 
ProtagonistA made a small , relatively uncommitted appearance at the door of the former home of a dead woman , but ProtagonistA did not allow ProtagonistB to remain there 
 ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB there before , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was not welcome 
 ProtagonistA did not want to cause any trouble , but ProtagonistA could not allow ProtagonistB to stay 
ProtagonistA stood before ProtagonistA's desk one sunny day in August and looked over the papers that ProtagonistA held in ProtagonistA's magic hand 
 ProtagonistA had been expecting this day for a long time , and ProtagonistA was not going to let anything stand in ProtagonistA's way 
 With a determined look on ProtagonistA's face , ProtagonistA started to shuffle through the papers , looking for the one that ProtagonistA needed 
 Finally , ProtagonistA found it 
 With a deep breath , ProtagonistA started to read aloud 
 ProtagonistA , do hereby solemnly swear that ProtagonistA will never rest until ProtagonistA have avenged ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA will find the people who did this to us and make them pay 
 ProtagonistA will make them regret the day they ever crossed ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA finished reading the paper , ProtagonistA felt a fire burning inside of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA had to do 
 ProtagonistA would find the people who had destroyed ProtagonistA's family and ProtagonistA would make them pay 
ProtagonistA came to he through the bar , and ProtagonistA – opened ProtagonistA's eyes – saw the world entirely different from the way it was 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had been given a new lease on life , and ProtagonistA was determined to make the most of it 
 ProtagonistA started talking to people , making new friends , and exploring all the new things the world had to offer 
 ProtagonistA was happy and content , and ProtagonistA knew that this was the life ProtagonistA was meant to live 
ProtagonistA was an apprentice to ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA came to the Yard as a gentle visitor 
 ProtagonistA quickly learned the ropes and became a valuable member of the team 
 ProtagonistA stepped up and took charge , ensuring that the job was done right 
 ProtagonistA proved ProtagonistA to be a true leader , and the other members of the team respected ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was happy to learn from ProtagonistB and soon became an expert groundskeeper ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was fourteen years old and ProtagonistB was a cold , hard - working , lonely widow who had no business putting ProtagonistA into such a bizarre situation 
 ProtagonistA was looking forward to a summer of hanging out with ProtagonistA's friends and riding ProtagonistA's bike around the neighborhood 
 But ProtagonistB , ca n't someone else do it ? ProtagonistA do n't want to go to the city 
 So , with a heavy heart , ProtagonistA set off for the city 
 ProtagonistA had never been there before and ProtagonistA was feeling very nervous 
 ProtagonistA took the subway to Mr
 Johnson ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA mother sent ProtagonistA to deliver this package ,  ProtagonistA said , holding it out 
 ProtagonistA was starting to feel very sorry for ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA had never talked to anyone like ProtagonistC before and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA opening up to ProtagonistC 
 Before ProtagonistA knew it , ProtagonistA was telling ProtagonistC everything about ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA left ProtagonistC's apartment feeling much better than when ProtagonistA had arrived 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had just had a very special conversation with ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never forget ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA would always cherish the time they had spent together 
ProtagonistA was a simple man who lived in a small village near the port of Southampton 
 ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's living as a fisherman , and ProtagonistA's life was peaceful and quiet 
 Immediately , ProtagonistA ordered the repair of the port 
ProtagonistA is a handsome , lanky fellow , with a black beard and a black - rimmed eye , and ProtagonistA is a very good man , for all the good ProtagonistA has done 
 ProtagonistA has helped many people in ProtagonistA's community , and ProtagonistA is always willing to lend a helping hand 
 ProtagonistA is a true friend , and ProtagonistA will always be there for you , no matter what 
ProtagonistA had the misfortune to be born in a large and well - ordered house on which ProtagonistA had been born and reared , and which ProtagonistA's grandfather had purchased for a gift for ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA became increasingly frustrated with ProtagonistA's confinement 
 ProtagonistA longed to see the world and experience life outside of ProtagonistA's gilded cage 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was 18 , ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA had had enough 
 ProtagonistA packed a bag and snuck out of the house in the middle of the night 
 ProtagonistA hitchhiked into town and started exploring 
 ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA loved the freedom and the chaos of the outside world 
 ProtagonistA met new people and did things that ProtagonistA never would have been able to do if ProtagonistA had stayed in ProtagonistA's grandfather 's house 
 ProtagonistA eventually left town and started traveling the world 
 ProtagonistA had many adventures and made lots of memories 
 ProtagonistA was happy to finally be living ProtagonistA's life on ProtagonistA's own terms 
ProtagonistA was down in the basement preparing to play ProtagonistA's music in a small VCR when ProtagonistB called ProtagonistA over 
 ProtagonistA had been looking forward to this all day and was not about to let anything stop ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA got to the top of the stairs , ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB screaming 
 ProtagonistA ran into the living room to find ProtagonistB being attacked by a large snake 
 ProtagonistA grabbed the snake and threw it out the window 
When I first met ProtagonistA in college , ProtagonistA was studying a respectable course and was well - known in the neighborhood 
 ProtagonistA was a member of the Acobalt House , or  House of the Green - Bears ,  which was a wealthy family 's house in the neighborhood 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's garden , watching ProtagonistA's fowls , and ProtagonistA talked to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was very happy 
 ProtagonistA showed ProtagonistB around and explained how ProtagonistA had built it up over the years 
 ProtagonistA was happy to answer them all 
 ProtagonistA was very proud of ProtagonistA's garden and loved to talk about it 
One lovely day ProtagonistA was walking through the meadow and up to ProtagonistA's house 
 ProtagonistA was whistling a tune as ProtagonistA walked , enjoying the sunny day 
 As ProtagonistA got closer to ProtagonistA's house , ProtagonistA saw something strange 
 ProtagonistA started to run , and as ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA saw that the object was a giant snake 
 ProtagonistA was terrified , and ProtagonistA ran into ProtagonistA's house and slammed the door shut 
 ProtagonistA called the police , and they came and took the snake away 
ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw a sign that said  ProtagonistA , is ProtagonistC the Son of ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA do n't know , but ProtagonistA 'm going to find out !  So ProtagonistA went into the church and asked the priest 
  ProtagonistA was disappointed , but ProtagonistA decided to ask ProtagonistC ProtagonistC 
  ProtagonistA was amazed and excited ! ProtagonistA went back down the mountain and told everyone what ProtagonistA had heard 
ProtagonistA was a simple man 
 ProtagonistA worked hard and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life 
 But ProtagonistA did not know it then , but ProtagonistA was about to leave ProtagonistA's life behind 
 ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way home from work when ProtagonistA was suddenly hit by a car 
 ProtagonistA died instantly 
 But ProtagonistA was in a better place 
 ProtagonistA was finally at peace 
ProtagonistA had been looking forward to this day for months 
 ProtagonistA had finally saved up enough money to buy ProtagonistA's very own trunk of books 
 ProtagonistA woke up early that morning , eager to get to the bookstore 
 ProtagonistA stood in the garden , admiring the flowers and the bees buzzing around them 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and smiled 
 ProtagonistA arrived at the bookstore and walked in , trunk in hand 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and set ProtagonistA's trunk down with a thump 
 I'd like to buy this trunk of books , please ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 've been saving up for months ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and lugged the trunk out to the garden 
 ProtagonistA could n't wait to get started on ProtagonistA's new adventure 
ProtagonistA was an ugly boy , and ProtagonistA knew it , and ProtagonistA just wanted to be loved 
 ProtagonistA had never had a girlfriend , and ProtagonistA was starting to lose hope 
 ProtagonistA had tried everything ProtagonistA could think of to make ProtagonistA more attractive , but nothing seemed to work 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had found the love ProtagonistA had been looking for 
 ProtagonistA was a gentle giant , and everyone who knew ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA went to lift a small dog , and the dog yelped in pain 
 ProtagonistA was so shocked and upset that ProtagonistA immediately put the dog down and ran away 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to hurt anyone ever again 
ProtagonistA had been through a lot lately 
 ProtagonistA had lost everything 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head , and ProtagonistB could see the pain in ProtagonistA's eyes 
ProtagonistA was having a terrible day 
 First , ProtagonistA's alarm clock did n't go off , so ProtagonistA was late for work 
 As ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistA's house , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , perched atop a tree in ProtagonistA's yard 
 ProtagonistA had always been allergic to cats , but ProtagonistB was the worst 
 ProtagonistA was about to go inside and take a much - needed nap when ProtagonistA heard a splash 
 ProtagonistA looked over and saw ProtagonistB , struggling to swim in ProtagonistA's pool 
 ProtagonistA sighed and shook ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA had to do 
 ProtagonistA went over to the pool and grabbed a net 
 As ProtagonistA swished it around in the water , ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB meowing in terror 
 Finally , ProtagonistA was able to scoop ProtagonistB out of the pool 
 ProtagonistA put ProtagonistB down on the ground , and ProtagonistB ran away as fast as ProtagonistB could 
 ProtagonistA went inside , exhausted from ProtagonistA's day 
 As ProtagonistA lay in bed , ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistB meowing outside ProtagonistA's window 
 But ProtagonistA was too tired to care 
 ProtagonistA had been playing with ProtagonistA's friends in the park when they found a dead bird 
 At first , ProtagonistA did n't want to do it , but ProtagonistA's friends convinced ProtagonistA 
 So ProtagonistA put the bird in ProtagonistA's backpack and went home 
 When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistA's room and took the bird out of ProtagonistA's backpack 
 ProtagonistA felt guilty as ProtagonistA looked at the bird 's lifeless body 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should n't have put the bird in ProtagonistA's backpack , but ProtagonistA's friends had convinced ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was swimming in the vast ocean when ProtagonistA saw something billowy and black flutter in the breeze 
 But instead of being scared , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA feeling curious 
 ProtagonistA reached out to touch the octopus and was surprised to find that it was soft and gentle 
 ProtagonistA laughed as the octopus tickled ProtagonistA 
 It was the most fun ProtagonistA 'd ever had!Eventually , ProtagonistA had to swim back to shore 
 ProtagonistA was sad to say goodbye to ProtagonistA's new friend , but ProtagonistA knew they would meet again soon 
ProtagonistA was a child of ProtagonistA's time , but like all true children of ProtagonistA's time ProtagonistB died when ProtagonistA was eight 
 ProtagonistA never really knew ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB deeply 
 ProtagonistA often wondered what ProtagonistA's life would have been like if ProtagonistB had lived 
 Would ProtagonistA have been a different person ? Would ProtagonistA have been happier ? ProtagonistA would never know 
ProtagonistA was walking along the street when ProtagonistA saw a dog 
 ProtagonistA huffed , but ProtagonistA did n't puff 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to scare the dog 
 ProtagonistA was happy 
 ProtagonistA had made a new friend 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a worrywart 
 Ever since ProtagonistA was a young boy , ProtagonistA was always afraid that ProtagonistA was going to die prematurely 
 So , when ProtagonistA turned 30 , ProtagonistA decided to start keeping a diary 
 ProtagonistA called it the  Lazenby 's Diary  after ProtagonistA's favorite character in a book series ProtagonistA used to read as a kid 
 For the next few years , ProtagonistA diligently wrote in ProtagonistA's diary every day 
 ProtagonistA detailed ProtagonistA's fears , ProtagonistA's worries , and ProtagonistA's hopes for the future 
 ProtagonistA even started to feel better as ProtagonistA got everything off ProtagonistA's chest 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistA started to feel really sick 
 ProtagonistA tried to ignore it at first , but it quickly became clear that something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA went to the doctor , and they diagnosed ProtagonistA with a rare form of cancer 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's days were numbered 
 So , ProtagonistA decided to write one final entry in ProtagonistA's diary 
 ProtagonistA detailed ProtagonistA's battle with cancer , and how ProtagonistA was slowly losing the fight 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistA's diary for helping ProtagonistA through the tough times , and then ProtagonistA signed off with a sad farewell 
 A few weeks later , ProtagonistA passed away 
 ProtagonistA is laughing because ProtagonistA just won the lottery 
 ProtagonistA is laughing because ProtagonistA is happy 
 ProtagonistA is laughing because ProtagonistA is excited 
ProtagonistA had such a huge view of the sea that ProtagonistA's mind seemed to be made up of seas 
 ProtagonistA was an old man , but ProtagonistA had the eyes of a child 
 Today , ProtagonistA was telling me about the time ProtagonistA was hit by lightning 
ProtagonistA was a very private person and ProtagonistA did not like to be disturbed 
 ProtagonistA was very particular about ProtagonistA's things and ProtagonistA would not have it any other way 
 ProtagonistA lived a very simple life and ProtagonistA was content with that 
 ProtagonistA did not need anything else and ProtagonistA did not want anything to change 
ProtagonistA had a name for a machine that could change the course of the storm , but ProtagonistA never named it 
 ProtagonistA had built it to save lives , but ProtagonistA knew that it could be used for destruction as well 
 ProtagonistA knew that the machine was too powerful to fall into the wrong hands , so ProtagonistA kept it a secret 
 ProtagonistA worked on the machine day and night , and it was finally finished 
 The day of the storm , ProtagonistA turned on the machine and directed it at the storm 
 ProtagonistA had saved the city , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could never tell anyone about the machine 
ProtagonistA had always been a homebody 
 ProtagonistA never left ProtagonistA's small town , not even for a vacation 
 So , when ProtagonistA was suddenly awoken in the middle of the night by a feeling that ProtagonistA needed to go on a journey , ProtagonistA was completely unprepared 
 ProtagonistA had no idea where to start or what to do 
 ProtagonistA tried to go back to sleep , but the feeling was persistent 
 Finally , ProtagonistA got out of bed and began to pack a small bag 
 ProtagonistA had no idea where ProtagonistA was going or how long ProtagonistA would be gone , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to go 
 ProtagonistA drove for hours , not knowing where ProtagonistA was going 
 ProtagonistA just followed the feeling 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA came to a small cabin in the woods 
 ProtagonistA went inside and found a comfortable bed to sleep in 
 In the morning , ProtagonistA would start the next phase of ProtagonistA's journey , whatever that may be 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for years , ever since ProtagonistA could remember 
 ProtagonistA had never stopped , never looked back 
 ProtagonistA had just kept walking , through the night and the day , through the rain and the snow 
 ProtagonistA had walked through forests and deserts and mountains and plains 
 ProtagonistA had walked across rivers and streams and lakes 
 ProtagonistA had walked through cities and towns and villages 
 ProtagonistA had walked past homes and schools and hospitals 
 ProtagonistA had walked past people and animals and cars 
 ProtagonistA had walked past buildings and trees and stones 
 ProtagonistA had just kept walking , never stopping , never looking back 
  ProtagonistA looked around at the group of people assembled and nodded 
  ProtagonistA wo n't keep you long , ProtagonistA just wanted to let you know that ProtagonistA 've decided to retire 
  ProtagonistA know , ProtagonistA know ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA looked around the room one last time , ProtagonistA's eyes lingering on each person in turn 
  It 's been a good ride ,  ProtagonistA said 
 With that , ProtagonistA turned and walked out of the room , leaving the stunned crowd behind ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was crying hysterically 
  Yes , ProtagonistA wants ProtagonistA to kill ProtagonistA !  ProtagonistA cried 
  But ProtagonistA was adamant 
  No , ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA really wants ProtagonistA to kill ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA do n't know why , but ProtagonistA said it would be a ' favor 
  Yes , ProtagonistA is 
 Maybe ProtagonistA was right and ProtagonistA did want ProtagonistA to kill ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was old and sick , and ProtagonistA had been getting weaker and weaker for months 
 ProtagonistA tried to stay positive , but it was hard 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to die 
 ProtagonistA had so much still to do 
 But ProtagonistA knew that it was inevitable 
 ProtagonistA could n't fight it any longer 
 ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA's goodbyes to ProtagonistA's family and friends , and then ProtagonistA lay down to die 
 ProtagonistA was at peace with ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's decision 
 As ProtagonistA drifted off to sleep , ProtagonistA thought about all the good times ProtagonistA had in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had lived a good life , and ProtagonistA was ready to move on to the next one 
 ProtagonistA was reading an article in the New - York Tribune , while we were walking between Eton two miles away 
 Today , however , ProtagonistA could tell something was bothering ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA gently asked ProtagonistB what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA listened patiently as ProtagonistB spoke , offering words of comfort and support 
 ProtagonistA was glad ProtagonistA could be there for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that , no matter what , ProtagonistB would always be the picture of calm and serenity 
ProtagonistA went over to the wharf , where three anchor - ships stood ready to receive ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been planning this trip for weeks and was finally able to set sail 
 ProtagonistA had never felt so free 
 ProtagonistA's voice makes us feel at once like ProtagonistA was there 
 ProtagonistA has a way of carrying ProtagonistA that is both strong and gentle , and ProtagonistA's eyes seem to hold the wisdom of the ages 
 ProtagonistA is a natural leader , and people are drawn to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA has a way of making everyone feel comfortable and accepted , and ProtagonistA's laughter is infectious 
 ProtagonistA has a heart for people , and ProtagonistA always goes out of ProtagonistA's way to help others 
 ProtagonistA 's the kind of person who makes the world a better place just by being in it 
ProtagonistA had been in the hospital wing for what felt like forever 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA could barely contain ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA said goodbye to the nurses and doctors and made ProtagonistA's way out to the parking lot 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to see ProtagonistA's car there 
 ProtagonistA did n't remember driving to the hospital 
 ProtagonistA must have been in more of a state than ProtagonistA thought 
 ProtagonistA got in ProtagonistA's car and drove home , feeling grateful that ProtagonistA was finally out of the hospital 
ProtagonistA was eight years old when ProtagonistA heard the story and the story just was n't the same anymore 
 ProtagonistA had always loved the story of the three little pigs , but now that ProtagonistA knew how the story really ended , ProtagonistA just could n't enjoy it the same way 
 ProtagonistA tried to forget about it , but every time ProtagonistA heard the story , ProtagonistA just could n't help but think about the gruesome ending 
 ProtagonistA had never seen the light of day , but ProtagonistA had heard stories of it 
 ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA was ever going to live , ProtagonistA must find the golden door 
 ProtagonistA had seen it in ProtagonistA's dreams and ProtagonistA was sure it was real 
 ProtagonistA spent ProtagonistA's days searching for it , and when ProtagonistA found it , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get out 
 ProtagonistA walked through the door and into the light 
ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's studio , working on a new painting , when ProtagonistA heard the doorbell ring 
 ProtagonistA smiled and peered into the frame to see what the matter was , but ProtagonistA soon realised that it was nothing more than a routine visit from ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was happy to oblige , and ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB a few names of some other painters whose work ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistB might enjoy 
ProtagonistA stood on the deck of the ship as the sun sank into the horizon 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but stare at the beautiful sight 
 As ProtagonistA watched , ProtagonistA felt a mix of contempt and fascination 
 ProtagonistA had actually considered ProtagonistA unlucky 
 ProtagonistA was a good worker and had been with the company for years , but when the recession hit , ProtagonistA was one of the first to go 
 ProtagonistA tried to find other work , but it was hard to come by 
 ProtagonistA started to get behind on ProtagonistA's bills and soon found ProtagonistA homeless 
 ProtagonistA was living on the streets , eating out of dumpsters , and doing whatever ProtagonistA could to survive 
 ProtagonistA was miserable and felt like ProtagonistA had no way out 
 One day , ProtagonistA was begging for money outside of a grocery store 
 ProtagonistA was so grateful that ProtagonistA decided to use the money to buy a lottery ticket 
 To ProtagonistA's amazement , ProtagonistA won the jackpot ! ProtagonistA was suddenly a millionaire 
 ProtagonistA started to gamble and soon lost all of ProtagonistA's money 
 ProtagonistA was back to where ProtagonistA started 
 ProtagonistA was homeless and penniless 
 ProtagonistA realized then that ProtagonistA had been lucky to win the lottery in the first place and that it was ProtagonistA's own fault that ProtagonistA was in the situation ProtagonistA was in 
 ProtagonistA was miserable and felt like there was no way out

 ProtagonistA was miserable and felt like there was no way out 
 ProtagonistA had been struggling for days , and ProtagonistA was tired of it 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to be a burden to anyone anymore 
 ProtagonistA went to the local grocery store and bought a bottle of pills 
 ProtagonistA took them all and lay down to die 
 ProtagonistA woke up the next day , realizing that ProtagonistA had been foolish to try and take ProtagonistA's own life 
 ProtagonistA was still alive and still had a chance to turn things around 
 ProtagonistA decided then and there to get help and turn ProtagonistA's life around 
 ProtagonistA went to rehab and got clean 
 ProtagonistA found a job and slowly started to rebuild ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA is now happy and healthy and is grateful to be alive 
ProtagonistA is best , for now , when the only thing that matters is that ProtagonistA feels loved , and is acknowledged as such , some of the time , and not always 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA is not the best person in the world , but ProtagonistA also knows that ProtagonistA is not the worst 
 ProtagonistA just wants to be loved , and to feel like ProtagonistA matters 
 Sometimes , ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA does matter , and other times , ProtagonistA feels like ProtagonistA does n't 
 ProtagonistA just wants to be loved , and to feel like ProtagonistA matters 
ProtagonistA was fresh out of college and ready to start ProtagonistA's career 
 ProtagonistA had been through a few interviews , but none of them had gone well 
 ProtagonistA was getting desperate 
 ProtagonistA had no money and no prospects 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA saw an ad for a job that sounded perfect for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA went to the interview and it went well 
 ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA had the job in the bag 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB and went home 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was going to do now 
 ProtagonistA was out of options 
 ProtagonistA had always been a man of some means , and had never been one to allow ProtagonistA's house to fall into disrepair 
 But now , as ProtagonistA looked around ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA saw that it was in a state of complete ruin 
 ProtagonistA called a meeting of the Board of Trustees , of which ProtagonistA was the chairman , and demanded that something be done about the state of the house 
 ProtagonistA donated a large sum of money to the cause , and ProtagonistA also began to raise funds from other sources 
 ProtagonistA was extremely proud of what ProtagonistA had accomplished , and ProtagonistA was grateful to all those who had helped ProtagonistA to achieve ProtagonistA's goal 
 ProtagonistA is a big man , and ProtagonistA 's not afraid of a little competition 
 ProtagonistA is determined to win this contest 
 ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA can do it 
 ProtagonistA 's nervous , but ProtagonistA 's also excited 
 The contest is close , but in the end , ProtagonistA is the winner 
ProtagonistA had been working at ProtagonistA's job for about a month and a half , and ProtagonistA was starting to get into a routine 
 ProtagonistA would usually come home from work , eat dinner , and then either watch TV or work on some project that ProtagonistA had been meaning to start 
 However , one Monday evening , before ProtagonistA had settled into ProtagonistA's routine , ProtagonistA decided to make a discovery 
 ProtagonistA had been walking home from work , and ProtagonistA noticed a small alley that ProtagonistA had never noticed before 
 ProtagonistA decided to explore it , and ProtagonistA found a small door that led to a staircase 
 ProtagonistA climbed the staircase , and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA on the roof of the building 
 ProtagonistA could see the entire city from up there , and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had discovered something special 
ProtagonistA was always a truth seeker 
 ProtagonistA was never one to take things at face value and was always looking for the hidden meaning behind everything 
 On the site , ProtagonistA dedicated a new page to the truth behind everything ProtagonistA could find 
 Sadly , ProtagonistA passed away in early 2013 
 However , ProtagonistA left behind a legacy in the form of ProtagonistA's website 
 On the day of ProtagonistA's death , ProtagonistA dedicated a new page to ProtagonistA's site , titled Truthism 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider 
 ProtagonistA was happy being different 
 ProtagonistA began to see things that were n't really there 
 ProtagonistA would see people 's faces change into monsters or hear their voices turn into demonic whispers 
 ProtagonistA tried to tell ProtagonistA that it was n't real , but the more ProtagonistA tried to ignore the hallucinations , the worse they got 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA was so scared and paranoid that ProtagonistA could n't leave ProtagonistA's house 
 ProtagonistA was a prisoner in ProtagonistA's own mind 
 ProtagonistA had been a student at the University of Stirling for two years , and was a member of the Royal Society 
 ProtagonistA was a bright young man , and had a promising future ahead of ProtagonistA 
 So , ProtagonistA decided to start ProtagonistA's own society , which ProtagonistA called the  New Royal Society  
 ProtagonistA was determined to make it better than the old one , and to prove to the world that ProtagonistA was the best 
 ProtagonistA made many breakthroughs , and helped to advance the field of science 
 ProtagonistA had finally achieved ProtagonistA's dream , and had proved to the world that ProtagonistA was the best 
  A plot , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB ,  is a plan or scheme , usually secret , to accomplish some desired end 
 ProtagonistA just have to have faith in ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistA 'll try 
ProtagonistA woke up in the morning and ProtagonistA could n't remember who had killed ProtagonistA's grandad 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and went downstairs , and ProtagonistA saw the police officer who had come to arrest ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was shocked and ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA asked the officer what was going on , and the officer told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA had killed ProtagonistA's grandad 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it , and ProtagonistA asked the officer to take ProtagonistA to the station 
  ProtagonistA 've been working on this project for months , and ProtagonistA finally have everything ProtagonistA need to make it happen 
 ProtagonistA had been working on a secret project for months , and it was finally coming together 
 ProtagonistA had been able to secure the funding and the resources ProtagonistA needed , and now all ProtagonistA needed was the green light from ProtagonistB 
 I'm going to present it to ProtagonistB tomorrow ,  ProtagonistA continued 
  And ProtagonistA think ProtagonistB 's going to go for it 
 ProtagonistA just know it 
 ProtagonistA was confident in ProtagonistA's project , and ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would see the potential 
 ProtagonistA had put in the work and ProtagonistA was ready for it to pay off 
 The next day , ProtagonistA went into ProtagonistB's office and presented ProtagonistA's project 
ProtagonistA had ordered ProtagonistA's men to bring ProtagonistA an escape pod from Paris 
 ProtagonistA knew that the city was about to be overrun by the enemy , and ProtagonistA wanted to be able to get away if things went bad 
ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's bloody scar on ProtagonistA's forehead in the fact that ProtagonistA had been shot in the back of the head , and ProtagonistA's left arm sticking out from underneath the elbow 
 ProtagonistA had tried to hide it , but it was always there , a constant reminder of that fateful day 
 ProtagonistA would spend hours staring at it , wondering what it was made of and how it got there 
 ProtagonistA was skeptical , but ProtagonistA could n't deny that the globe had a certain power about it 
 As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA began to understand the true purpose of the globe 
 ProtagonistA was proud to be the son of the man who had brought such a magnificent object to the city 
 Now , as ProtagonistA gazed at the globe , ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and calm 
 ProtagonistA knew that as long as the globe was there , the city would be safe 
 ProtagonistA was my best friend , and ProtagonistA was always up for a challenge 
 So when I told ProtagonistA about my plan to put ProtagonistA on the moon , ProtagonistA was all for it 
 ProtagonistA was a little apprehensive at first , but ProtagonistA soon got used to the idea 
 And when ProtagonistA stepped out of the spaceship , ProtagonistA was the first person to walk on the moon 
 ProtagonistA was up there for less than a minute when we heard ProtagonistA screaming 
 If only I had listened to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would be safe at home on Earth instead of being a lunatic on the moon 
ProtagonistA had been in and out of court more times than ProtagonistA could count 
 As usual , when ProtagonistA appeared before the judge , ProtagonistA carried a small silver bird 
 ProtagonistA sighed as ProtagonistA was led away by the bailiff 
 ProtagonistA knew that this was n't the end for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA would be back in court again , and ProtagonistA would continue to carry ProtagonistA's silver bird with ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had not been awake for more than ten minutes when ProtagonistA was informed that there was ProtagonistB waiting for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a bit surprised , as ProtagonistA was not expecting any visitors 
 ProtagonistA got up and went to the living room , where ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB sitting on the couch 
 ProtagonistA slammed on the brakes and the three men leapt out of the car 
In the year 1789 , ProtagonistA was making a tour of the country 
 While in England , ProtagonistA had written a remarkable book which described all the events of ProtagonistA's country 
 ProtagonistA had also written some notes relating to a particular town of that name , called Merseyside 
 ProtagonistA had read about its history and its people , and ProtagonistA had even visited it once before 
 But this time , ProtagonistA wanted to see it for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA arrived in the town on a sunny day in August 
 ProtagonistA walked around , taking everything in 
 ProtagonistA stopped to talk to some of the locals and to get a feel for the place 
 ProtagonistA felt right at home 
 ProtagonistA spent a few days exploring the town and its surroundings 
 ProtagonistA was particularly interested in the docks , where ProtagonistA watched the ships coming and going 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA had to move on , but ProtagonistA left with a feeling of warmth in ProtagonistA's heart for the town of Merseyside 
ProtagonistA lived in a house , which ProtagonistA called the Champion House 
 ProtagonistA did n't mind 
 ProtagonistA was content to live in ProtagonistA's little house and never left the town 
ProtagonistA was a great wizard , and ProtagonistA owned ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB would spend hours talking about all sorts of things 
 One day , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA agreed and the two set off on their journey 
On the last night of ProtagonistA's life , ProtagonistA dreamed of the dream at the bottom of a well 
 In the dream , ProtagonistA was standing at the edge of a vast , dark abyss 
 ProtagonistA knew that if ProtagonistA jumped into the abyss , ProtagonistA would fall into the light and be free 
 ProtagonistA also knew that if ProtagonistA did n't jump , ProtagonistA would never be free 
ProtagonistA was just finishing up a long and tiring day of harvesting apples in an orchard when ProtagonistB suddenly appeared before ProtagonistA 
 What is it , ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA had always known that ProtagonistC was a ruthless leader , but ProtagonistA had never thought that ProtagonistC would stoop so low as to kill an innocent man 
 We have to do something ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA thought for a moment 
 Then , ProtagonistA had an idea 
 We can warn ProtagonistD ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door and ProtagonistD answered 
 ProtagonistA quickly explained the situation and ProtagonistD nodded 
 With ProtagonistD's safety assured , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB turned to go back home 
 ProtagonistA knew that there was no escaping now 
 ProtagonistA could only hope that ProtagonistD would be safe 
ProtagonistA had been lying in bed for hours , thinking about the future 
 ProtagonistA had the idea of trying to kill ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had never been a violent person , but ProtagonistA was tired of living in fear 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being afraid to leave ProtagonistA's house , or even open ProtagonistA's windows 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being afraid to go to sleep at night , in case the gang came and killed ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's sleep 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and began to get dressed 
 ProtagonistA put on ProtagonistA's heaviest clothes , and ProtagonistA's strongest boots 
 ProtagonistA filled ProtagonistA's pockets with stones , and took a knife from the kitchen 
 ProtagonistA knew it would n't be enough to kill ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA had to try 
 ProtagonistA walked to the gang 's territory , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
 ProtagonistA had never been this close to them before 
 ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB , surrounded by ProtagonistB's gang members 
 ProtagonistA tried to dodge ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB was too fast 
ProtagonistA was a simple man who lived in a small village 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life and did n't desire more than what ProtagonistA had 
 ProtagonistA did n't believe the stranger , but ProtagonistA was curious about what the stranger said 
 ProtagonistA was skeptical , but ProtagonistA decided to go on an adventure to find the lost city 
 After weeks of searching , ProtagonistA finally found the lost city 
 ProtagonistA entered the city and was amazed by the sight of all the treasure 
 ProtagonistA took as much as ProtagonistA could carry and went back to ProtagonistA's village to share ProtagonistA's wealth with ProtagonistA's friends and family 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life and was happy to have made such a great discovery 
ProtagonistA was a young boy who dreamed of one day seeing an intergalactic species 
 ProtagonistA loved learning about space and all of the different planets and stars 
 One day , ProtagonistA saw a news report about a new intergalactic species that had been discovered 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to see them that ProtagonistA went to the store and bought a telescope 
 ProtagonistA set it up in ProtagonistA's backyard and waited for nightfall 
 When the stars came out , ProtagonistA looked through ProtagonistA's telescope and saw the most amazing sight 
 ProtagonistA saw the new intergalactic species for the very first time 
 ProtagonistA was so excited that ProtagonistA ran inside to tell ProtagonistA's family 
 Unfortunately , ProtagonistA was too young to live to see the day when ProtagonistA saw the very first intergalactic species 
 ProtagonistA says that ProtagonistA has heard many stories about ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA is sure that ProtagonistB is still alive and well , although ProtagonistA can not say for certain where ProtagonistB is currently living 
ProtagonistA had been in bed for weeks , barely moving except to eat and use the restroom 
 ProtagonistA felt restless and decided to try to get out of bed 
 ProtagonistA slowly sat up and then jerked ProtagonistA's legs over the edge of the bed 
 ProtagonistA felt a little lightheaded , but ProtagonistA was determined to stand up 
 With a lot of effort , ProtagonistA finally made it to ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistA took a few steps and then stopped to rest 
 ProtagonistA smiled as ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA was on ProtagonistA's way to recovery 
ProtagonistA was not the type of person to leave ProtagonistA's house without a key ; nor was ProtagonistA the type to do less than that 
 ProtagonistA was the type of person who would always make sure ProtagonistA's house was locked before leaving , no matter how short the trip 
 ProtagonistA rushed back home , imagining the worst 
 ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of relief and vowed to never again leave ProtagonistA's house unlocked 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistA got there , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to find a way out 
 ProtagonistA started to look around for a way out , but the only thing ProtagonistA could find was a door 
 ProtagonistA tried to open it , but it was locked 
 ProtagonistA started to feel panicky , but then ProtagonistA saw a key on the floor 
 ProtagonistA picked it up and tried it in the lock , and it worked 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and walked out into a beautiful garden 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB there , and ProtagonistB was holding a baby 
ProtagonistA had spent a long time in ProtagonistA's life watching ProtagonistA's friends grow , and ProtagonistA had grown sick of it 
 ProtagonistA was tired of being the odd one out , the one who was n't growing 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided enough was enough 
 ProtagonistA was going to take control of ProtagonistA's life and make a change 
 ProtagonistA started by getting a new haircut and updating ProtagonistA's wardrobe 
 ProtagonistA then took up some new hobbies and joined some new clubs 
 ProtagonistA was finally starting to feel like ProtagonistA again 
 ProtagonistA was happy and content 
 Now , every time ProtagonistA looks at ProtagonistA's friends , ProtagonistA does n't feel envy or jealousy , but happiness and pride 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA made the right decision to take control of ProtagonistA's life and ProtagonistA 's never looking back 
ProtagonistA was a young hero , and ProtagonistA knew it 
 ProtagonistA had always been a hero , ever since ProtagonistA was a little boy 
 And now , ProtagonistA was going to save the world 
 ProtagonistA was going to stop ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was going to do it all by ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was going to be the hero that everyone needed 
 ProtagonistA pulled the hood up over ProtagonistA's head and started to run 
 ProtagonistA had to get to ProtagonistB's lair before it was too late 
 ProtagonistA had to stop ProtagonistB before ProtagonistB could destroy the world 
 ProtagonistA was the only one who could do it 
 ProtagonistA ran as fast as ProtagonistA could , but ProtagonistA was too late 
 ProtagonistA collapsed to the ground , defeated 
 ProtagonistA had failed 
 ProtagonistA had failed everyone 
 But then , ProtagonistA heard a voice 
 But then , ProtagonistA got up 
 ProtagonistA was n't going to give up 
 ProtagonistA was going to stop ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was going to save the world 
 And ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistA was the first man on Earth , and ProtagonistA was given the task of creating everything 
 ProtagonistA did a good job , but ProtagonistA was lonely 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB became ProtagonistA's wife 
 ProtagonistA had never been able to find it on any of ProtagonistA's expeditions to the west beyond the Archipelago , but ProtagonistA had always felt drawn to it 
 ProtagonistA had heard rumours that the sands of the Lost City were warm and inviting , and ProtagonistA was eager to see for ProtagonistA 
 As ProtagonistA walked across the sands , ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and calm wash over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would never want to leave 
ProtagonistA has been serving in the cavalry since ProtagonistA was three 
 However , ProtagonistA is getting older and the colonel knows ProtagonistA wo n't be able to serve forever 
 ProtagonistA is sad to go , but ProtagonistA knows it 's time 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB with all of ProtagonistA's heart , and ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistA back just as much 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do or how to cope with the news 
 ProtagonistA was there for ProtagonistB's every step of the way , but it was hard to see ProtagonistB suffer 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had lost a part of ProtagonistA 
 But even though ProtagonistB was gone , ProtagonistA still felt ProtagonistB's love 
ProtagonistA looked down at the pile of dusty papers on the table and sighed 
  That 's not the problem with the world , is it ?  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA had been working at the library for years , and ProtagonistA had seen the world change 
 ProtagonistA missed the days when people valued knowledge and learning 
 ProtagonistA nodded 
ProtagonistA always wore ProtagonistA's hat in one hand and ProtagonistA's moustaches in the other 
 ProtagonistA was a bit of a dandy , and ProtagonistA knew it 
 But ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA looked damn good in that hat , and those moustaches made ProtagonistA feel like a million bucks 
 ProtagonistA 'd been growing them out for years , and they were finally starting to get some real length to them 
 ProtagonistA was proud of ProtagonistA's moustaches , and ProtagonistA was n't afraid to show them off 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking down the street , hat in one hand and moustaches in the other , when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA could n't help but stare at ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB smiled at ProtagonistA as ProtagonistB walked by 
 ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB walk away , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to talk to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA quickly put ProtagonistA's hat back on ProtagonistA's head and ran after ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA caught up to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA introduced ProtagonistA and asked ProtagonistB out on a date 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to make a good impression , so ProtagonistA went home and spent hours getting ready 
 ProtagonistA put on ProtagonistA's best clothes and made sure ProtagonistA's moustaches were styled perfectly 
 When the date came , ProtagonistA showed up at ProtagonistB's door looking like a million bucks 
 ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA 'd finally found ProtagonistB 
 From that day on , ProtagonistA always made sure to wear ProtagonistA's hat in one hand and ProtagonistA's moustaches in the other when ProtagonistA went out on a date with ProtagonistB 
As the sun rose in the garden , ProtagonistA landed on ProtagonistA's feet , stretched out on the grass and shook the dust from ProtagonistA's boots 
 ProtagonistA looked around at the beautiful flowers and the bees buzzing from flower to flower 
 ProtagonistA felt so lucky to be able to live in such a beautiful place 
 ProtagonistA heard a rustling in the bushes and saw a rabbit hop out 
 ProtagonistA watched it go , then laid back down and closed ProtagonistA's eyes , soaking in the warmth of the sun 
The night before they set out to find ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA believed that the world was ending and ProtagonistA was going to die 
 ProtagonistA was shaking and sweating , and ProtagonistA could n't stop thinking about all the ways that ProtagonistA was going to die 
 ProtagonistA was sure that the end was coming , and ProtagonistA was terrified 
 When ProtagonistA's friends came to get ProtagonistA in the morning , ProtagonistA was still shaking , but ProtagonistA went with them 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to die alone , and ProtagonistA was hoping that maybe , just maybe , they could find a way to save ProtagonistA 
When ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistB wanted to have you killed , ProtagonistA was n't exaggerating 
 However , just as ProtagonistB was about to say the incantation , ProtagonistA appeared and stopped ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been following ProtagonistB and had overheard ProtagonistB's plans 
 ProtagonistA fought ProtagonistB and won , saving your life in the process 
Dipping ProtagonistA's finger into the bottle of a tiny silver tumbler , ProtagonistA lifted it to ProtagonistA's lips 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes , savoring the taste of the whiskey 
 When ProtagonistA opened them again , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB watching ProtagonistA from across the room 
 ProtagonistA downed the rest of the whiskey and set the glass down on the table before making ProtagonistA's way over to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA woke up the next morning with a headache 
 ProtagonistA cursed ProtagonistA for drinking so much , but the night with ProtagonistB was worth it 
 ProtagonistA got out of bed and stumbled to the bathroom , hoping that a shower would make ProtagonistA feel better 
 As ProtagonistA turned on the water , ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door 
 ProtagonistA wrapped a towel around ProtagonistA's waist and went to answer it 
 ProtagonistA signed for it and took the package inside 
 ProtagonistA opened it to find a bottle of whiskey and a note from ProtagonistB that said ,  For next time 
  ProtagonistA smiled and went to take a shower 
If ProtagonistA had n't seen the horse , ProtagonistA's father , William A
 But when ProtagonistA saw the horse , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's father was nearby and would soon find ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was seventeen years old when ProtagonistA made a fortune in the province of Anglesey 
 ProtagonistA remained there until ProtagonistA was disgusted with the mean and stupid character of the people who lived there 
 ProtagonistA took in some of them and made arrangements for their government 
 ProtagonistA preserved all their rights and privileges without any serious inconvenience to ProtagonistA or any of them 
 ProtagonistA 's always spouting off about how ProtagonistA knows better than anyone else and how everyone else is just wrong 
 Well , one day ProtagonistA finally goes too far 
 ProtagonistA gets into an argument with ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB finally has enough 
 ProtagonistA ca n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA always thought ProtagonistA was the best and that ProtagonistA knew everything 
 Now ProtagonistA 's out of a job and ProtagonistA has to face the fact that ProtagonistA might not know everything after all 
ProtagonistA was a victim , not of malice , but of ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was always a good person , always helping others and never expecting anything in return 
 ProtagonistA was just going about ProtagonistA's day , minding ProtagonistA's own business , when ProtagonistB intervened 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's life , but ProtagonistA always felt like there was something more out there for ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to take a walk and explore ProtagonistA's neighborhood 
 ProtagonistA had never really looked around before , and ProtagonistA was amazed at all the things ProtagonistA had been missing 
 ProtagonistA saw the beauty in the world for the first time and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA wanted more 
 From then on , ProtagonistA started to take walks every day , and ProtagonistA slowly started to change ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA began to notice the little things and appreciate them more 
 ProtagonistA became a happier person , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had found what ProtagonistA was looking for 
ProtagonistA had always wanted to be an emperor 
 Ever since ProtagonistA was a young boy , ProtagonistA had dreamed of ruling over a vast empire 
 ProtagonistA knew that this was ProtagonistA's chance to finally achieve ProtagonistA's dream 
 With the help of ProtagonistA's great - grandmother 's wealth , ProtagonistA was able to amass a large army and conquer many lands 
 As ProtagonistA's empire continued to grow , ProtagonistA became more and more confident in ProtagonistA's abilities as a ruler 
 ProtagonistA began to believe that there was nothing ProtagonistA could n't achieve 
 ProtagonistA became the emperor of a vast and powerful empire 
 And ProtagonistA ruled with wisdom and strength , making ProtagonistB proud 
ProtagonistA had been watching the flowers for hours , and ProtagonistA was getting bored 
 ProtagonistA got up to stretch ProtagonistA's legs , and when ProtagonistA turned back to the window , ProtagonistA saw something that made ProtagonistA's heart stop 
 ProtagonistA quickly called the police , and when they arrived , they found ProtagonistB had a gun 
Buckingham 's old - fashioned chair looked over ProtagonistA's shoulder as ProtagonistA looked over ProtagonistA's books 
 Now , ProtagonistA was the only one in the family who was tall enough to sit in it 
 ProtagonistA loved the chair , and ProtagonistA loved the way it made ProtagonistA feel 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was a part of something larger than ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that the chair would be there for ProtagonistA , no matter what happened 
 This time ProtagonistA had been talking to ProtagonistA's friends about a new invention ProtagonistA had seen on the internet 
 ProtagonistA had found the website and ordered the device 
 When it arrived , ProtagonistA was so excited to try it out 
 ProtagonistA put it on ProtagonistA's shoes and went for a run 
 But after a few minutes , ProtagonistA realized that something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA was going too fast , and ProtagonistA could n't slow down 
 ProtagonistA tried to take the device off , but it was stuck 
 ProtagonistA ran all the way home , and by the time ProtagonistA got there ProtagonistA was exhausted 
 ProtagonistA had made a fool of ProtagonistA , and now ProtagonistA was in a lot of trouble 
At the time ProtagonistA had not even heard of the Winter Sickness , but ProtagonistA knew everything about it 
 ProtagonistA was a doctor , and ProtagonistA was determined to find a cure 
 ProtagonistA spent every waking hour in ProtagonistA's lab , working on a cure 
 But try as ProtagonistA might , ProtagonistA could not find one 
 But then , one day , ProtagonistA found a clue 
 And from that day on , ProtagonistA worked even harder , until ProtagonistA finally found the cure 
ProtagonistA had been watching the stock markets for a few hours when ProtagonistA heard the news 
 ProtagonistA was worried about ProtagonistA's investments and about the economy 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
ProtagonistA was wearing the black trousers of a captain , a white shirt and a black blouse , with a red sash , and ProtagonistA's hair had been pulled back into a beautiful bun 
 ProtagonistA was the most handsome man that ProtagonistB had ever seen 
 ProtagonistA was so perfect 
 And ProtagonistA was looking at ProtagonistB with such intensity 
 ProtagonistA walked over to ProtagonistB and took ProtagonistB's hand 
  ProtagonistA 'm Bob ,  ProtagonistA said 
 ProtagonistA was so tall and strong 
 I know ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA 've been watching ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA 've been waiting for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA know it 's sudden , but ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA ca n't do this without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB to be ProtagonistA's wife 
The day that ProtagonistA disobeyed ProtagonistB's wishes , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would be in for it 
 As ProtagonistA approached the house , ProtagonistA could feel an eerie presence 
 ProtagonistA tried to shake the feeling and entered the house 
 Once inside , ProtagonistA immediately regretted ProtagonistA's decision 
 ProtagonistA could feel the hair on the back of ProtagonistA's neck stand up , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to get out of there 
 ProtagonistA turned to make ProtagonistA's escape , but ProtagonistA was frozen in place 
 ProtagonistA could n't move 
 ProtagonistA tried to scream , but no sound would come out 
 ProtagonistA was lying on the ground , surrounded by a crowd of people 
 ProtagonistA could see the executioner standing over ProtagonistA , ready to strike 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to die , but ProtagonistA was not afraid 
 ProtagonistA had lived a good life , and ProtagonistA was ready to meet ProtagonistA's maker 
 As the executioner raised his axe , ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and said a silent prayer 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would be reunited with ProtagonistA's loved ones soon 
 ProtagonistA never knew ProtagonistA's mother , and ProtagonistA's father died when ProtagonistA was just a boy 
 ProtagonistA grew up to be a strong and handsome man , and ProtagonistA had a heart for adventure 
 One day , ProtagonistA set out on ProtagonistA's own , and ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA in the New World 
 ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way across the continent , and ProtagonistA eventually settled in the American West 
 ProtagonistA became a successful rancher , and ProtagonistA married a beautiful woman 
 ProtagonistA was a good man , and ProtagonistA was loved by all who knew ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted ProtagonistA's own place , and this seemed like the perfect opportunity 
 ProtagonistA was able to get the room for a very reasonable price , and ProtagonistA set to work immediately 
 ProtagonistA painted the walls a bright , cheery color and hung some curtains 
 ProtagonistA placed a comfortable bed in one corner and a small table and chairs in another 
 ProtagonistA was very pleased with the results 
ProtagonistA was a very pretty girl , far too pretty for ProtagonistA's age 
 ProtagonistA had the perfect look for it , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA could make it if ProtagonistA just had the chance 
 One day , ProtagonistA got that chance 
 ProtagonistA started modeling and was a huge success 
 ProtagonistA loved the fast paced lifestyle and the attention ProtagonistA was getting 
 ProtagonistA was making more money than ProtagonistA ever could have dreamed of 
 But as the years went by , ProtagonistA started to feel empty inside 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's small town and the simple life 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was chasing the wrong dream 
 ProtagonistA quit modeling , moved back to ProtagonistA's small town , and started living a more authentic life 
 And ProtagonistA was finally happy 
 ProtagonistA had seen a world that was not ProtagonistA's own , a world that was filled with strange creatures and even stranger people 
 ProtagonistA had seen a city that was in the grip of a dark power , a power that seemed to be corrupting everything it touched 
 And ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was driving along the street when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what ProtagonistB meant , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was right 
 ProtagonistA had been searching for something ProtagonistA's whole life , but ProtagonistA had never been able to put ProtagonistA's finger on what it was 
 ProtagonistA did n't hesitate 
 ProtagonistA had a feeling that ProtagonistB was going to change ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA did as ProtagonistA was told , and soon ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a beautiful house by the sea 
 It 's a weight that ProtagonistA 's been carrying around for far too long and ProtagonistA 's finally ready to let it go 
 ProtagonistA 's nervous , but ProtagonistA 's also excited 
 ProtagonistA meets ProtagonistB at a party and they hit it off immediately 
 ProtagonistA is about to finally lose ProtagonistA's virginity 
 when ProtagonistA suddenly realizes that ProtagonistA left ProtagonistA's wallet at the party 
 ProtagonistA 's not ready to lose ProtagonistA's virginity just yet 
 ProtagonistA still has ProtagonistA's wallet when ProtagonistA gets home , but ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA 's not ready to give up ProtagonistA's virginity just yet 
 ProtagonistA 's glad that ProtagonistA did n't go through with it , but ProtagonistA also knows that ProtagonistA 'll be ready soon 
 ProtagonistA just has to find the right person 
ProtagonistA was a happy person , despite living in a vast and empty world 
 ProtagonistA had a good sense of humor and was always cheerful 
 One day , ProtagonistA found a box in the middle of the world 
 ProtagonistA was now ProtagonistA's father 's caretaker , and ProtagonistA cherished the time they spent together , even if it was just sitting in silence 
 In the little room of the King 's house within the great garden behind the house , ProtagonistA sat taking ProtagonistA's father 's hand in he 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's father did n't always understand what was going on , but ProtagonistA also knew that ProtagonistA's father was still the same man ProtagonistA had always loved 
ProtagonistA had never been one for commitment 
 ProtagonistA liked ProtagonistA's freedom and ProtagonistA liked ProtagonistA's space 
 So when ProtagonistA inherited ProtagonistA's uncle 's estate , ProtagonistA was not planning to marry , not until ProtagonistA had had ProtagonistA's fill of the immaculate manse 
 But then ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 Slowly but surely , ProtagonistA began to fall in love with ProtagonistB 
 And before ProtagonistA knew it , ProtagonistA was planning to marry ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB would be the perfect wife for ProtagonistA and that together they could make a life that was full of love and happiness 
ProtagonistA had been desirous of knowing what life would be like after ProtagonistA decided to have a baby , because ProtagonistA could not help but be curious , and had played the part of a constantly curious girl – uh … diary and all – in every conversation 
 But as the weeks turned into months , ProtagonistA began to settle into a routine 
 ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA loved watching ProtagonistA's baby grow and change , and that the exhaustion was worth it when ProtagonistA saw the smile on ProtagonistA's child 's face 
 ProtagonistA was still curious about what the future held , but now ProtagonistA had a little one to help ProtagonistA explore it 
 ProtagonistA was a baby when ProtagonistA heard the message , scarcely able even to sit up , but , in all probability , sitting still 
 But ProtagonistA listened , because ProtagonistA could not help it 
 And when the voice told ProtagonistA to do something , ProtagonistA did it 
 It was only later , when ProtagonistA was older , that ProtagonistA realized how foolish ProtagonistA had been 
 But ProtagonistA was not so lucky 
 ProtagonistA had talked to one of them , and now ProtagonistA was in their thrall 
 ProtagonistA would do whatever they asked of ProtagonistA , no matter how terrible 
 And ProtagonistA would never be able to escape 
 ProtagonistA was ProtagonistB's best friend , and they were always together 
 ProtagonistA vowed to find ProtagonistC and make ProtagonistC pay 
 But ProtagonistA never could 
 But ProtagonistA always suspected that ProtagonistC was still out there , somewhere 
 And ProtagonistA was right 
 ProtagonistA had a gun and ProtagonistA shot ProtagonistC 
 And then ProtagonistA wept , for ProtagonistB and for ProtagonistA 
To this day , ProtagonistA has to deal with the fact that ProtagonistB , had a heart of stone 
 ProtagonistA was only six years old at the time , but ProtagonistA remembers ProtagonistB vividly 
 ProtagonistA has never forgiven ProtagonistB for that 
ProtagonistA had been working as a fisherman for years , and ProtagonistA knew the North Sea like the back of ProtagonistA's hand 
 ProtagonistA had a bad feeling in ProtagonistA's gut , but ProtagonistA did n't want to let ProtagonistA's crew down 
 So , ProtagonistA bravely set out into the storm 
 ProtagonistA had been out for hours , and they had barely caught anything 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a huge crash 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to swim 
 ProtagonistA fought against the current , but it was too strong 
 ProtagonistA was getting tired and knew ProtagonistA was going to drown 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and accepted ProtagonistA's fate 
 But then , ProtagonistA felt something grab onto ProtagonistA and pull ProtagonistA up 
 ProtagonistA gasped for air and opened ProtagonistA's eyes to see ProtagonistA's crew mates pulling ProtagonistA into the lifeboat 
 ProtagonistA was safe 
 ProtagonistA vowed to never go out in a storm again 
ProtagonistA holds the door open for ProtagonistA's boss , but as ProtagonistA does , ProtagonistA can tell that ProtagonistA's boss is not happy 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA's boss is going to be there for a while , and that ProtagonistA is not going to be able to leave until ProtagonistA's boss is done with ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA prayed for a solution but nothing came to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been struggling with ProtagonistA's faith for a while and had been questioning whether ProtagonistC was real 
 ProtagonistA had tried everything ProtagonistA could think of to find an answer , but nothing had worked 
 ProtagonistA was starting to lose hope 
 One night , ProtagonistA had a dream 
 In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA woke up , ProtagonistA felt different 
 ProtagonistA knew that what ProtagonistA had seen was real and that ProtagonistA needed to keep faith 
 ProtagonistA started to pray again and this time , ProtagonistA felt a peace come over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would find the answers ProtagonistA was looking for 
ProtagonistA was one of the most popular women of his day 
 However , ProtagonistA was secretly unhappy 
 ProtagonistA longed for a more simple life , away from the constant attention 
 One day , ProtagonistA made a decision to leave ProtagonistA's life of fame behind and start anew 
 ProtagonistA changed ProtagonistA's name and moved to a small town 
 ProtagonistA was finally happy living a quiet life where ProtagonistA was n't constantly in the spotlight 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the edge of the water , eating a dinner of snowball peas and tarts , in the backyard of the house ProtagonistA had rented for the summer 
 ProtagonistA had rented the house for the summer because ProtagonistA wanted to get away from the city and relax 
 ProtagonistA had been coming to the same spot for years and knew all the best places to find peace and quiet 
 This summer , ProtagonistA was determined to make the most of ProtagonistA's time and relax as much as possible 
 ProtagonistA had made friends with some of the locals and was enjoying the slower pace of life 
 Tonight , ProtagonistA was just enjoying the peace and quiet of the backyard and the beautiful sunset 
 ProtagonistA was a bit nervous , as ProtagonistA had never done anything like this before , but ProtagonistA was also excited to be doing something new 
 As the conversation flowed around ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA relaxing and enjoying ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA laughed at the jokes , and added ProtagonistA's own comments when ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA was surprised to find that ProtagonistA actually had a lot to say , and that ProtagonistA was really enjoying ProtagonistA 
 When it was time to go , ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for inviting ProtagonistA , and said that ProtagonistA had had a wonderful time 
 ProtagonistA was already looking forward to the next coffee - table conversation , and to getting to know the other people in the group better 
ProtagonistA may have walked ProtagonistA's dog for a long time , but ProtagonistA had nothing to lose 
 ProtagonistA was a middle - aged man with a wife and two kids 
 So , when ProtagonistA saw an ad for a dog walking service , ProtagonistA decided to give it a try 
 ProtagonistA soon found out that walking dogs was the best part of ProtagonistA's day 
 ProtagonistA even started to feel like ProtagonistA was making a difference in their lives 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's job and started ProtagonistA's own dog walking business 
 ProtagonistA was finally doing something ProtagonistA loved and ProtagonistA was making a difference in the lives of the dogs ProtagonistA walked 
 But soon ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's place in the group , and the days passed pleasantly enough 
 In a short time ProtagonistA had made such progress that ProtagonistA's father was quite proud of ProtagonistA , and used to boast of ProtagonistA's talent to the other guests at the palace 
ProtagonistA was a widow who loved ProtagonistA's children very much 
 Even though they were grown , ProtagonistA still treated them like they were little 
 ProtagonistA was always there for them when they needed ProtagonistA and was always willing to help out in any way ProtagonistA could 
 ProtagonistA was a great father and they loved ProtagonistA very much 
 ProtagonistA was two years older than ProtagonistB , and was very different from ProtagonistB in character 
 ProtagonistA was wild and reckless , and always getting into mischief ; but ProtagonistA was good - hearted , and had a soft spot for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA used to tease ProtagonistB and make fun of ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA always did it in a good - natured way , and ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistA was only joking 
ProtagonistA had been drinking with ProtagonistA's husband and ProtagonistB at a little inn in a certain town in the United States at the time when the great tempo of American industry was at an end 
 ProtagonistA had been trying to keep ProtagonistB from drinking , but ProtagonistB had insisted on it 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA was just tired and wanted to go to bed 
ProtagonistA was sitting at ProtagonistA's dining room table in the picture room , watching with some interest as the door of ProtagonistA's second class compartment was pushed open 
 It is ,  ProtagonistA said 
  But ProtagonistA do n't mind if ProtagonistB join ProtagonistA 
 I'm Bob ,  ProtagonistA said , extending ProtagonistA's hand 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA attracted to ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA could tell that ProtagonistB was interested in ProtagonistA as well 
 ProtagonistA was a very happy man , and ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's animals very much 
 ProtagonistA was very worried and ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to lose any of ProtagonistA's sheep , so ProtagonistA decided to go and find them ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA searched all over the farm , but ProtagonistA could n't find them anywhere 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a noise in the distance and ProtagonistA started to run towards it 
 When ProtagonistA got there , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistA's sheep and ProtagonistA's horses all safe and sound 
 ProtagonistA was so relieved and ProtagonistA was very happy that ProtagonistA had found them all 
Every Sunday , Father 's Day , ProtagonistA , had the usual Sunday breakfast 
 ProtagonistA was a widower , and ProtagonistA's children were all married and living away from home 
 ProtagonistA always looked forward to Sunday breakfast 
 When ProtagonistA arrived at ProtagonistB's house , ProtagonistA could tell something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA soon found out what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA could not imagine ProtagonistA's life without ProtagonistB 
 But ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to be strong for ProtagonistA's grandchildren 
ProtagonistA was walking to the door of ProtagonistB's cabin when ProtagonistA heard the birds chirping 
 ProtagonistA sat down and told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's day , and ProtagonistB listened attentively 
 ProtagonistA loved hearing stories about ProtagonistB's adventures , and ProtagonistA was always eager to hear more 
 ProtagonistA thought about it for a long time and ProtagonistA could n't come to a conclusion 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistA's friends and they all had different opinions 
 In the end , ProtagonistA decided that it was ProtagonistA's duty and ProtagonistA did it 
 ProtagonistA was very tall for ProtagonistA's age and loved to play basketball 
 ProtagonistA was always the tallest kid on ProtagonistA's team and one of the best players 
 When ProtagonistA was sixteen , ProtagonistA decided to try out for the varsity basketball team at ProtagonistA's high school 
 ProtagonistA made the team and was one of the starting players 
 ProtagonistA was the tallest player on the team and one of the best players 
 ProtagonistA helped the team win many games and they even made it to the state championship game 
 ProtagonistA was a great player and helped ProtagonistA's team win the state championship 
ProtagonistA went to bed in the morning , early , thinking of the presents ProtagonistA would be leaving ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had wrapped them all up nicely and placed them under the tree 
 ProtagonistB would be so surprised ! ProtagonistA could n't wait to see the look on ProtagonistB's face when ProtagonistB opened them 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA had gotten ProtagonistB the perfect gifts 
ProtagonistA passed through the night , with the white light of dawn bathing ProtagonistA's white hull in rainbow splendor , ProtagonistA was in port , and with a view across the ocean to Mediterranean 
ProtagonistA was lying on the floor on ProtagonistA's back , rocking back and forth , stretching out ProtagonistA's heels in the air 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a pair of old , faded jeans and a white t - shirt 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and turned away from ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA could n't bring ProtagonistA to speak 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had failed ProtagonistB somehow 
 ProtagonistA , please tell ProtagonistB what 's wrong ,  ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistB's voice filled with concern 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and finally spoke 
  ProtagonistA failed the test ,  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's voice trembling 
 ProtagonistA nodded and leaned into ProtagonistB's embrace 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was right 
ProtagonistA stood on the leadstaff of the slave ship and looked down at ProtagonistA's own bare feet 
 ProtagonistA had been a slave for as long as ProtagonistA could remember , and ProtagonistA had never known anything else 
 But ProtagonistA was not content to simply accept ProtagonistA's fate 
 ProtagonistA had a plan 
 ProtagonistA was going to escape 
 ProtagonistA was going to find a way to freedom 
 ProtagonistA had heard stories of a place called America , where slavery was not allowed 
 ProtagonistA was going to find that place , and ProtagonistA was going to be free 
 It was a beautiful day , and ProtagonistA was out in the park , enjoying the sunshine and the fresh air 
 ProtagonistA was happy and content , and ProtagonistA felt that everything was right with the world 
 ProtagonistA was a middle - aged man and was starting to feel the effects of time 
 ProtagonistA had been a stay - at - home dad for the past few years , but ProtagonistA's wife had recently gone back to work 
 ProtagonistA was feeling a bit lost and was n't sure what ProtagonistA's purpose was anymore 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out for a walk and ProtagonistA saw a sign for a baking class 
 ProtagonistA had always loved baking and cooking , so ProtagonistA decided to sign up 
 ProtagonistA went to the first class and loved it 
 ProtagonistA met a lot of new people and felt like ProtagonistA belonged there 
 ProtagonistA started going to the baking class every week and it quickly became ProtagonistA's favorite thing to do 
 ProtagonistA loved trying new recipes and learning new techniques 
 ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA was finally doing something with ProtagonistA's life that ProtagonistA was passionate about 
ProtagonistA was nine years old when ProtagonistA first heard of the death of ProtagonistC 
 It was a cold winter day and ProtagonistA was inside playing with ProtagonistA's toys 
 ProtagonistA could tell by the look on ProtagonistB's face that something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA did n't understand what that meant at first , but ProtagonistA soon realized that ProtagonistC was never coming home 
 ProtagonistA was sad for a long time after that 
 ProtagonistA was six years old at the time , and ProtagonistA sat in the room and watched as the beetle made its landing 
ProtagonistA was a fine , cheerful , cheerful girl of fifteen years of age , who had a cheerful manner , and good sense , but no very good sense ; and though ProtagonistA was wo nt to be a good - humoured and a happy - go - lucky girl , ProtagonistA was not without a certain air of melancholy 
 ProtagonistA had never been able to please ProtagonistA's stepfather , who was a stern , hard man , and ProtagonistA had grown to hate the work in the factory 
 ProtagonistA was too young to understand what was happening , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was in danger 
 ProtagonistA would never forget the brave soldier who saved ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA followed close behind , ProtagonistB clinging to ProtagonistA tightly 
 What happened ?  ProtagonistA asked 
One cold , gray November day , after a long winter 's heat , and a placid and happy season of summer , ProtagonistA , lay on ProtagonistA's bed in the green garden of ProtagonistA's maternal grandmother 's , thinking of the wholesome things that a well - ordered house could do for the comfort of the mind and body , without the extra expense of a large house , or a great purchase of land , or any other thing of the kind ; and in consequence of these wholesome things , the mind and body improved so much , that from the time that ProtagonistA was quite able to think , ProtagonistA could form any idea , no matter how dim and conflicting , regarding any particular object or thing , unless absolutely absolutely necessary ; and ProtagonistA thus became a very pretty , and very intelligent , and very happy woman , and saved ProtagonistA's family much distress , expense , and trouble , and earned in itself a considerable profit 
ProtagonistA sat down in the heather green armchair in ProtagonistA's little office and talked 
  ProtagonistA 'm so tired of all this ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA just want to retire and live in peace 
  But ProtagonistA ca n't just leave ProtagonistA's job 
 ProtagonistA have to finish what ProtagonistA started 
  ProtagonistA sighed and nodded 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was right 
 But ProtagonistA could n't help but feel like ProtagonistA was already retired , living in a world of ProtagonistA's own 
ProtagonistA was sleeping and felt a sharp pain in ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA woke up with a start and saw that ProtagonistA's pillow was covered in blood 
 ProtagonistA quickly got out of bed and went to the bathroom to see what was happening 
 ProtagonistA saw that ProtagonistA's head was bleeding profusely and ProtagonistA quickly applied pressure to the wound to try and stop the bleeding 
 ProtagonistA then called for an ambulance and was taken to the hospital 
ProtagonistA had always loved sports 
 ProtagonistA loved the feeling of competition and the rush of adrenaline that came with it 
 As ProtagonistA grew older , ProtagonistA's love for sports only grew 
 ProtagonistA became a star athlete in high school and went on to play in college 
 Now , ProtagonistA is a professional athlete 
 But even though ProtagonistA 's achieved so much , ProtagonistA still has that same childish love for sports 
 And ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA always will 
 ProtagonistA found a job as a clerk in a small office 
 ProtagonistA was not very good at ProtagonistA's job and was often scolded by ProtagonistA's boss 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was working , ProtagonistA received a letter from ProtagonistA's father 's lawyer 
 ProtagonistA was overjoyed 
 ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's job and went to live a life of luxury 
 ProtagonistA was like a sister to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was the one who made sure ProtagonistB had food and shelter 
 ProtagonistA was the one who made sure ProtagonistB went to school and got an education 
 ProtagonistA was the one who made sure ProtagonistB had a job and was able to support ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was the one who was always there for ProtagonistB , no matter what 
 ProtagonistA was going through a tough time and ProtagonistB wanted to be there for ProtagonistA , just like ProtagonistA had been there for ProtagonistB all those years ago 
ProtagonistA had always been a happy - go - lucky guy 
 ProtagonistA was always smiling and joking around 
 ProtagonistA was out walking ProtagonistC when ProtagonistA saw a group of kids playing in the park 
 ProtagonistA went over to see what was wrong and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC had run away 
 ProtagonistA helped ProtagonistB look for ProtagonistC , but they could n't find ProtagonistC anywhere 
 ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA did 
 ProtagonistB was so happy and ProtagonistA was so proud of ProtagonistA 
 But after that day , ProtagonistA was never the same 
 ProtagonistA was always looking for lost dogs and helping people find them 
 ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA's calling 
 ProtagonistA was a strong and healthy baby , and ProtagonistA thrived in the care of the islanders 
 ProtagonistA served the King faithfully for many years , and ProtagonistA was loved by all who knew ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was amazed , and ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's time 
One day , when ProtagonistA was about twelve years old , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were riding in the back of a coach through the suburbs of New York 
 As they rode , ProtagonistA looked out the window and saw a group of boys playing ball in a park 
 ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could be out there with them , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to be with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA saw that the coach 's wheel had come off 
 ProtagonistA waited outside with ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was disappointed , but ProtagonistA knew there was nothing ProtagonistA could do 
ProtagonistA preserved all ProtagonistA's memories in a jar 
 Every day , ProtagonistA would add a new memory to the jar 
 ProtagonistA started with the day ProtagonistA was born 
 ProtagonistA added ProtagonistA's first steps , ProtagonistA's first words , and ProtagonistA's first day of school 
 ProtagonistA added the day ProtagonistA met ProtagonistA's best friend , the day ProtagonistA got ProtagonistA's first pet , and the day ProtagonistA graduated from high school 
 ProtagonistA added ProtagonistA's wedding day , the birth of ProtagonistA's children , and the day ProtagonistA retired 
 ProtagonistA even added the day ProtagonistA died 
ProtagonistA was standing at the airport , waiting for ProtagonistA's flight when ProtagonistA heard the crashing of small - arms fire and the effect of the machine gun 
 ProtagonistA quickly ducked for cover , but not before ProtagonistA saw the terrorists running through the terminal , shooting indiscriminately 
 ProtagonistA lay there for what seemed like hours , trying to stay as quiet as possible 
 ProtagonistA could hear the terrorists shouting to each other in a language ProtagonistA did n't understand , and the occasional burst of gunfire 
 ProtagonistA was terrified , and ProtagonistA's mind raced as ProtagonistA tried to think of a way to escape 
 ProtagonistA cautiously peeked out from ProtagonistA's hiding spot and saw that the terrorists were gone 
 ProtagonistA quickly made ProtagonistA's way to the nearest exit and ran out into the safety of the night 
There was once ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was very little , and ProtagonistA was very passionate 
 ProtagonistA was passionate about everything ProtagonistA did , and ProtagonistA did n't care what anyone else thought 
 ProtagonistA was happy just doing ProtagonistA's own thing 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided ProtagonistA wanted to be a musician 
 ProtagonistA did n't care that ProtagonistA did n't know how to play any instruments , ProtagonistA was just going to do it 
 So ProtagonistA started learning how to play the guitar 
 ProtagonistA practiced every day , and eventually ProtagonistA got pretty good 
 ProtagonistA started playing gigs at local clubs , and people loved ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was happy doing what ProtagonistA loved , and ProtagonistA did n't care about anything else 
ProtagonistA was a great guy 
 ProtagonistA always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face and was always willing to help out 
 ProtagonistA was always looking for a good deal , and ProtagonistA was always looking to help people 
 ProtagonistA died tragically in a car accident , but ProtagonistA's legacy lives on 
 If you want to make a good purchase , you need to know three things about ProtagonistA : who ProtagonistA was , how ProtagonistA died , and how to make a good buy 
 ProtagonistA offered to buy the monkey a new foot , but the monkey just wanted to be left alone 
 ProtagonistA respected the monkey 's wishes and went on ProtagonistA's way 
 ProtagonistA was the one who got away , the one who always had something better to do 
 ProtagonistA had been their leader , their hope 
 ProtagonistA was the one who always had a plan , who always knew what to do 
 Now , ProtagonistA was back 
 ProtagonistA looked at them and smiled 
  ProtagonistA 'm back ,  ProtagonistA said 
The last time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a man 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB as a man who was content with ProtagonistB's life , and ProtagonistA was happy for ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had been walking home from getting groceries when ProtagonistA was grabbed from behind and thrown into the back of a van 
 ProtagonistA heard the van drive away and ProtagonistA was left alone 
 ProtagonistA managed to get the blindfold off and untie ProtagonistA's hands 
 ProtagonistA looked around and saw that ProtagonistA was in a forest 
 ProtagonistA started walking and eventually came across a road 
 ProtagonistA followed the road until ProtagonistA came to a town 
 ProtagonistA went to the police station and reported that ProtagonistA had been kidnapped 
The first time ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB dead , ProtagonistA felt the dread of death wash over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was gone , but ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a sense of dread 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to die too 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the corner of the sofa , with ProtagonistA's head resting on the edge of the sofa , when ProtagonistA heard a noise coming from the kitchen 
 ProtagonistA got up to investigate and saw a mouse running around on the counter 
 ProtagonistA quickly grabbed a piece of cheese and set it down on the floor 
 ProtagonistA watched as the mouse ate the cheese and then ran away 
ProtagonistA was walking home from work when ProtagonistA heard the cold wind howling 
 ProtagonistA quickened ProtagonistA's pace , but the wind seemed to be following ProtagonistA 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw ProtagonistB in the distance 
 ProtagonistA felt a cold chill run down ProtagonistA's spine and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was in danger 
 ProtagonistA tried to resist , but ProtagonistA could n't 
ProtagonistA was always a bit of a go - getter 
 ProtagonistA was never content to just sit around and wait for things to happen - ProtagonistA always had to be out there , making things happen 
 So it 's no surprise that ProtagonistA 's now one of the richest men in the world 
 But ProtagonistA's 's not content to just sit on ProtagonistA's laurels and enjoy ProtagonistA's wealth 
 ProtagonistA 's always looking for new ways to make even more money 
 And ProtagonistA 's never afraid to take risks 
 ProtagonistA is a true inspiration to everyone around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was sweating profusely and ProtagonistA's grip on the mans hand was slipping 
 ProtagonistA gratefully accepted and ProtagonistB helped ProtagonistA to a nearby bench where ProtagonistA could sit and rest 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC were sitting in the parlor discussing the recent death of ProtagonistB 
 However , ProtagonistA was also very saddened by the death of ProtagonistB and was still in mourning 
 ProtagonistA was gazing up at the clear blue sky , admiring the beauty of nature 
 ProtagonistA felt at peace lying there , and ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and drifted off to sleep 
 ProtagonistA was completely devoted to ProtagonistA's husband 
 At first , ProtagonistA was hesitant , but ProtagonistA eventually relented 
 As soon as ProtagonistA walked into the bar , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart racing as ProtagonistC talked to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could feel a stirring in ProtagonistA's loins 
 Before ProtagonistA knew it , ProtagonistA was following ProtagonistC back to ProtagonistC's place 
 In the morning , ProtagonistA snuck out , feeling guilty about what ProtagonistA had done 
 However , ProtagonistA could n't deny that ProtagonistA had enjoyed it immensely 
 From then on , ProtagonistA started going to the gay bar more and more , always hoping to run into ProtagonistC again 
 ProtagonistA had evidently gone down , and I feared ProtagonistA was drowned 
One day in August , a winter in the West , ProtagonistA came to a village to pick up ProtagonistB 
 They spent the day together catching up and ProtagonistA was happy to finally be able to hold ProtagonistB again 
ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistB's head , and down at ProtagonistB's feet , and said ,  ProtagonistB 'll be ProtagonistB's companion 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would have to take care of ProtagonistB soon 
The night ProtagonistA rose from ProtagonistA's deepest sleep ProtagonistA was found by ProtagonistA's father in the midst of the crowd of people who were gathered below the palace 
 ProtagonistA had no memory of what had happened to ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was happy to be back with ProtagonistA's family 
ProtagonistA has never been one for looking up at the stars 
 ProtagonistA prefers to keep ProtagonistA's feet on the ground , where things are simple and ProtagonistA can understand them 
 But on this particular night , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA lying on ProtagonistA's back in a field , staring up at the sky in wonder 
 The sky is blue and black and vast with the stars , but ProtagonistA is pale and yellow and ProtagonistA's light is dim , casting a yellowish tinge over the sea of stars which stands above the earth 
 For a moment , ProtagonistA forgot ProtagonistA's troubles and simply marveled at the beauty of the universe 
 Then ProtagonistA heard a voice calling ProtagonistA's name , and ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistA's friend , waving ProtagonistA over 
 ProtagonistA got up and dusting ProtagonistA off , ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistA's friend back to the campsite , where they sat around the fire and talked long into the night 
ProtagonistA sat up all night , and thought about all the things ProtagonistA had seen 
 ProtagonistA thought about the time ProtagonistA saw a man get hit by a car 
 ProtagonistA thought about the time ProtagonistA saw a woman get mugged 
 ProtagonistA thought about the time ProtagonistA saw a bank get robbed 
 ProtagonistA thought about all the violence and crime ProtagonistA had seen in ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA wondered why it was all so common 
 ProtagonistA wondered why people were n't kinder to each other , and why there was so much hate in the world 
 ProtagonistA sat up all night , and thought about these things , and ProtagonistA came to a conclusion : that the world was a cruel and violent place , and that there was nothing ProtagonistA could do to change it 
ProtagonistA had been on the ship for weeks , and was excited to finally be nearing their destination 
 ProtagonistA had been looking forward to seeing ProtagonistA's family again and could n't wait to get off the ship 
 However , just a few miles from the bridge that would take them to safety , ProtagonistA became ill with cholera 
 ProtagonistA died within a few days , alone and scared 
 ProtagonistA never got to see ProtagonistA's family again or experience the life ProtagonistA had been dreaming of 
One morning in October , 1890 , ProtagonistA came to the friend - house in the street called Beechmere Lane , with the sign over ProtagonistA's door :  B
  ProtagonistA had been working for ProtagonistB for nearly two years , and was a good workman 
 But this morning ProtagonistA looked worried and anxious 
 ProtagonistA ca n't afford to pay for it , and ProtagonistA do n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA can go home and look after ProtagonistC 
  Thank ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said 
ProtagonistA dropped ProtagonistA's bag of toys on the ground , looked up and saw a brick - and - mortar window with a two - foot - high gap in it 
 ProtagonistA could see the other side of the window , but it was too high for ProtagonistA to reach 
 ProtagonistA thought for a moment , then grabbed ProtagonistA's bag of toys and threw it through the gap 
 ProtagonistA climbed up on the bag and peered through the window 
 ProtagonistA could see a room full of toys , but there was no way to get to them 
 ProtagonistA sighed and climbed down , picking up ProtagonistA's bag of toys 
 ProtagonistA would just have to come back another day 
 ProtagonistA had been a happy baby , with a smile that could light up a room , and eyes that sparkled with mischief 
 As ProtagonistA grew , ProtagonistA continued to charm everyone ProtagonistA met 
 ProtagonistA was always the life and soul of the party , and ProtagonistA's infectious laughter was impossible to resist 
 ProtagonistA had a heart of gold , and was always ready to help anyone in need 
 ProtagonistA was also fiercely loyal to ProtagonistA's family and friends , and would do anything to protect them 
 ProtagonistA threw ProtagonistA into ProtagonistA's studies , determined to make ProtagonistB proud 
 ProtagonistA quickly became one of the top students in ProtagonistA's class , and was offered a place at the prestigious Port Omega Academy 
 ProtagonistA worked hard at ProtagonistA's studies , and was soon one of the most promising students at the academy 
 ProtagonistA had a bright future ahead of ProtagonistA , and was destined to make ProtagonistA's mark on the world 
ProtagonistA had been drinking with ProtagonistB all evening , and ProtagonistA had been told to go to bed early , for ProtagonistA was going to spend all night with ProtagonistB 
 However , ProtagonistA did n't want to go to bed , for ProtagonistA wanted to stay up and drink with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA went to bed , but ProtagonistA was so angry with ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA did n't want to talk to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had been reading stories to children for years 
 ProtagonistA loved doing it , and felt like ProtagonistA had a real gift for it 
 So when ProtagonistA had finally finished reading the story aloud to the two children , ProtagonistA had gone over the whole thing again , and felt more than ever that ProtagonistA had gone astray , to the extreme extent of the past 
 ProtagonistA just could n't seem to find the magic anymore 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA was losing ProtagonistA's touch , and that ProtagonistA would never be able to recapture the magic ProtagonistA once had 
ProtagonistA was a blonde girl with long black hair , and while ProtagonistA knew it was only a possibility that ProtagonistA would one day be all of thirty - two , it did n't matter 
 The day ProtagonistA turned thirty - two , ProtagonistA woke up to find that ProtagonistA's hair had turned completely white 
 ProtagonistA panicked at first , but then ProtagonistA realized that it did n't change who ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA was still the same person , just with a different hair color 
 ProtagonistA went about ProtagonistA's day as usual , and when ProtagonistA went to bed that night , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA's hair had turned back to its original color 
ProtagonistA 's coming 
 ProtagonistA 's coming ! ProtagonistA is on ProtagonistA's way to our house and we are so excited 
 ProtagonistA knew that this was ProtagonistA's duty , that ProtagonistA was required to marry and produce an heir , but ProtagonistA had never expected to be married to a man 
 Now , as ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA could see the same fear in ProtagonistB's eyes 
 It was clear that ProtagonistB was just as unwilling as ProtagonistA was , but there was no turning back now 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to be sick , but ProtagonistA managed to keep ProtagonistA together until the end 
 ProtagonistA could barely look at ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA could tell that the feeling was mutual 
 ProtagonistA had never felt so alone , and ProtagonistA knew that this was only the beginning 
ProtagonistA was having a tough day 
 Then , ProtagonistA got into a fight with ProtagonistA's best friend 
 ProtagonistA was so angry , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA's head was going to explode 
 ProtagonistA was so angry , ProtagonistA did n't even hear ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB was sorry 
ProtagonistA was a great speaker 
 ProtagonistA had a way with words that could make even the most boring topics interesting 
ProtagonistA was fifteen when ProtagonistA walked into the shopper 's window of the stockade at Nightingale 's Gate 
 ProtagonistA had never seen it in person before , and ProtagonistA was amazed by the sight 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to make of it all , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA wanted to explore more 
ProtagonistA was increasing in stature 
 ProtagonistA was a beautiful , cat - faced creature , but most people would admit that ProtagonistA was rather strange 
 ProtagonistA did n't seem to understand human emotions and often acted more like a cat than a person 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB became friends , and they would often spend time together , just talking and enjoying each other 's company 
ProtagonistA's name was Lucy , and ProtagonistA was just seventeen when we first met 
 ProtagonistA was a shy , introverted boy who always seemed to be looking for a way to escape the world 
 ProtagonistA had a gift for making people feel emotions they never knew they had 
 ProtagonistA was performing at a local coffee shop , and I was blown away 
 ProtagonistA started using drugs to cope with the pain of the world , and it eventually destroyed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA overdosed on heroin and died just a few months before our graduation 
 ProtagonistA had never dared to venture into the deep , but one day ProtagonistA decided to take the plunge 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was in another world entirely 
 ProtagonistA saw creatures ProtagonistA had never seen before and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was floating on a cloud 
ProtagonistA was walking through the great halls of the castle at the summit of a vast and summaing mount , when ProtagonistA came face to face with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB was very old and very tired 
 ProtagonistA was shocked , but ProtagonistA agreed to do it 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's knife and stabbed ProtagonistB in the heart 
On the night of the triumph of God , when the clouds of the tempest were in their most profuse motion , ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's womb , and bearing a son , whose name was John , uttered a pious prayer to ProtagonistB ; and said ,  Gentlemen , according to the divine will , ProtagonistA am now at liberty to choose the mode which most properly belongs to ProtagonistA ; in which , according to your minds and ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA shall be able to establish ProtagonistA's religion ; and for this purpose ProtagonistA beg leave to make ascertainment of the manner in which ProtagonistA shall assemble ProtagonistA's companions in this city 
  Having made this request , ProtagonistA then withdrew ; and it was not long before ProtagonistA returned , attended by a great number of persons , who were all clothed in white , and had their heads covered with crowns of thorns 
 These ProtagonistA conducted to the place where ProtagonistB was , and said to ProtagonistB ,  Behold , ProtagonistB , the religion which ProtagonistA have chosen , and which ProtagonistA believe to be the true one ; and these are ProtagonistA's companions , who , like ProtagonistA , are ready to suffer death for its sake 
 ProtagonistA replied ,  ProtagonistA am not led to believe this by any arguments which ProtagonistA can offer ; but by a certain inward feeling , which tells ProtagonistA that it is the true religion , and which is confirmed by the miracles which have been wrought in its favour 
ProtagonistA was sitting alone in a hospital bed , across the way from ProtagonistA's home 
 ProtagonistA was old and frail and ProtagonistA's health had been failing for some time 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA's time was running out and ProtagonistA wanted to be home with ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA was grateful for their visits , but ProtagonistA was ready to go home 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and thought about all the wonderful times ProtagonistA 'd had with ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA smiled as ProtagonistA remembered holidays , birthdays , and special moments 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had been blessed with a wonderful life 
 As ProtagonistA drifted off to sleep , ProtagonistA felt at peace 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would be reunited with ProtagonistA's family soon 
ProtagonistA was a well - built , long - legged , very pretty , pretty girl with a certain childlike air of innocence about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was always the life of the party , and ProtagonistA always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA was the kind of girl who made you feel good just by being around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was always friendly and always had time for a chat 
 ProtagonistA was the kind of girl who you just could n't help but like 
ProtagonistA considered ProtagonistA the luckiest woman alive 
 ProtagonistA had a beautiful wife , two healthy children , and a good job 
 ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistA's life and grateful for all that ProtagonistA had 
 ProtagonistA had been away at sea and had only recently returned 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's adventures at sea and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA about ProtagonistB's life as a wife and mother 
ProtagonistA had been in ProtagonistA's cell for two days now 
 ProtagonistA was innocent , but no one believed ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had given up hope 
 ProtagonistA could n't bear to get out of bed and face another day in this place 
 ProtagonistA just wanted to lay there and die 
 ProtagonistA sat up , expecting to see the guard 
 Instead , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't know who ProtagonistB was or what ProtagonistB was doing here 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was going to spend the rest of ProtagonistA's life in prison , but ProtagonistB was giving ProtagonistA hope 
 With ProtagonistB's help , ProtagonistA was able to escape from prison 
 ProtagonistA was finally free 
ProtagonistA was always a night owl 
 ProtagonistA loved staying up late and watching the moon 
 The moon was ProtagonistA's friend , and ProtagonistA was nothing without it 
 One night , ProtagonistA stayed up a little too late 
 ProtagonistA was so tired that ProtagonistA fell asleep 
 ProtagonistA was so upset that ProtagonistA did n't get to see the moon that night 
 ProtagonistA decided to go for a walk to clear ProtagonistA's head 
 As ProtagonistA was walking , ProtagonistA saw a shooting star 
 ProtagonistA made a wish that ProtagonistA would always be able to see the moon 
 The next night , ProtagonistA went to bed early 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to see the moon again 
 ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA got to see ProtagonistA's friend again 
 By this , ProtagonistA meant the act of speaking to the dead , and they would answer 
 It was a power ProtagonistA had discovered ProtagonistA had when ProtagonistA was just a child 
 When ProtagonistA's parents died in a car accident , ProtagonistA had gone to their graves and spoken to them 
 Now , as an adult , ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistA in a situation where ProtagonistA could use ProtagonistA's power to help others 
 ProtagonistA was able to help ProtagonistB , and it was an incredibly moving experience for both of them 
 Since then , ProtagonistA had helped many people to contact their loved ones who had passed away 
 It was a gift that ProtagonistA was able to give , and ProtagonistA was grateful for it 
 ProtagonistA had two brothers and two sisters , and they all loved each other very much 
 ProtagonistA was a happy child , and ProtagonistA loved to play by the sea 
 ProtagonistA would build sandcastles , and then ProtagonistA would run to the waves and jump in , splashing everyone around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was always laughing and joking , and everyone loved ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's brothers and sisters all helped ProtagonistB , and they managed to get by 
 When ProtagonistA was eighteen , ProtagonistA left home and went to London to find work 
 ProtagonistA found a job in a factory , and ProtagonistA worked there for many years 
 ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC , and they fell in love and got married 
 ProtagonistA was happy in London , but ProtagonistA always missed ProtagonistA's home by the sea 
 ProtagonistA would go back there for holidays , and ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistA's children to play by the waves 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA was happy with ProtagonistC and ProtagonistA's children 
 ProtagonistA continued to work in the factory , and ProtagonistA continued to take ProtagonistA's children back to the sea for holidays 
 And every time they did , ProtagonistA would remember the happy times ProtagonistA had with ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistA would know that , even though ProtagonistC was gone , ProtagonistC was still with ProtagonistA , in ProtagonistA's heart 
 ProtagonistA was content with ProtagonistA's job as a janitor at the local elementary school , and ProtagonistA did n't mind that people thought ProtagonistA was a little slow 
 ProtagonistA was thrilled to have a chance to show what ProtagonistA was really capable of 
 ProtagonistA worked hard all week , and by the end of the week , ProtagonistA had shown that ProtagonistA was just as smart as anyone else 
 ProtagonistA knew all the students ' names , and ProtagonistA was able to answer all the parents ' questions 
 ProtagonistA was always ready to help out anyone who needed it , and ProtagonistA was always eager to learn new things 
 ProtagonistA even went back to school to get ProtagonistA's GED , and ProtagonistA eventually went to college 
 ProtagonistA proved to everyone that ProtagonistA was not dumb , and that ProtagonistA could accomplish anything ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's mind to 
The day after ProtagonistA's engagement as an actress , ProtagonistA had a severe headache , and had to walk at all hours 
 ProtagonistA was so dizzy , ProtagonistA could barely see straight 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was going to vomit 
 ProtagonistA had no idea what was wrong with ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to see a doctor 
 ProtagonistA went to the ER , where they did a CT scan and found that ProtagonistA had a brain tumor 
 ProtagonistA is a figment of the imagination , created by a group of friends who all share the same love for dressing up and pretending to be someone else 
ProtagonistA was walking home from work when ProtagonistA noticed a strange light in the sky 
 ProtagonistA stopped and watched as the light grew closer and closer 
 ProtagonistA hesitated for a moment , but then ProtagonistA decided to go 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to see what was out there , and this was ProtagonistA's chance 
 ProtagonistA climbed aboard the ship and was taken to a room where ProtagonistA was asked to sit down 
 ProtagonistA was excited and scared all at the same time 
 ProtagonistA had no idea what ProtagonistA was getting ProtagonistA into 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA did n't believe it , but ProtagonistA was willing to try 
 When ProtagonistA arrived , ProtagonistA could see that it was in danger 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up when ProtagonistA remembered the voice telling ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA could do anything 
 ProtagonistA put on the suit and flew into action 
 ProtagonistA fought the monster and saved the planet 
 ProtagonistA was a hero 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA had done something amazing 
 ProtagonistA was tired , but ProtagonistA was also happy 
ProtagonistA had always loved books 
 ProtagonistA would spend hours upon hours in ProtagonistA's father 's bedroom , reading by the light of the window 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was seven and had nothing to do , ProtagonistA sat down on the floor and opened a book 
 ProtagonistA held the pages up against the light , and the light has never been the same again 
 ProtagonistA read and read , until the sun began to set and ProtagonistA's father came home 
 ProtagonistA had to get the food ready for the day , make sure the water was clean , and then ProtagonistA had to go out and find some more food 
 But first , ProtagonistA had to wake up the others 
 ProtagonistA started with a little song , ProtagonistA's voice echoing in the early morning air 
 ProtagonistA led the way as they flew out into the open sky 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's friends sang as they flew , their voices carrying on the wind 
ProtagonistA was sitting on the veranda of the front door with ProtagonistA's hands on the knob 
 ProtagonistA was about to go inside when ProtagonistA heard a noise 
 ProtagonistA got up and walked around the side of the house 
 ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB sitting on the ground with ProtagonistB's head in ProtagonistB's hands 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what was wrong 
 ProtagonistA felt sorry for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA sat down and talked to ProtagonistB for a while 
 Then ProtagonistA went inside and got ProtagonistB a glass of water 
 ProtagonistA sat with ProtagonistB until ProtagonistB felt better 
 ProtagonistA was awaiting the publication of ProtagonistA's work , which was entitled A History of the World 
 ProtagonistA determined to devote to the study of it all that was worthy of ProtagonistA's mind and to the satisfaction of the human race 
 ProtagonistA began to explain ProtagonistA's work to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA quickly realized that it was too complex for ProtagonistB to understand 
 ProtagonistA decided to simplify it for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA's work was a history of the world , but from a different perspective 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA had studied the history of the world from the perspective of the people who had lived in it 
 ProtagonistA had tried to understand their experiences and their points of view 
 ProtagonistA had also tried to understand the forces that had shaped their lives 
 ProtagonistA was happy to oblige 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB about the different periods of history that ProtagonistA had studied and the different people that ProtagonistA had written about 
 ProtagonistA also told ProtagonistB about the different ways that people had tried to make sense of the world 
 ProtagonistA would watch them for hours , studying their every move 
 ProtagonistA knew all there was to know about birds 
 ProtagonistA had nothing left to live for 
 ProtagonistA turned to the bible for comfort , and found ProtagonistA fixated on the section on birds 
 ProtagonistA read about their beauty , their grace , their freedom 
 And ProtagonistA longed for that freedom 
 ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA had to do 
 ProtagonistA went to the roof of ProtagonistA's building , and spread ProtagonistA's arms wide 
 Then ProtagonistA jumped 
 As ProtagonistA fell , ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace wash over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would soon be reunited with ProtagonistA's true love : the birds 
ProtagonistA sits cross - legged on the floor of the dark alcove , ProtagonistA's fingers tracing the lines of a small painting 
 ProtagonistA does n't know who ProtagonistB is , but ProtagonistA feels drawn to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA ca n't explain it , but ProtagonistA feels a deep connection to it 
 Please , ProtagonistA begs , let ProtagonistA find ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA does n't know what ProtagonistA 'll do if ProtagonistA finds ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA has to try 
 ProtagonistA does n't know how long ProtagonistA sits there , but eventually ProtagonistA gets to ProtagonistA's feet and starts to search for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA does n't know ProtagonistB's name , but ProtagonistA 's sure ProtagonistA 'll know ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA sees ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA does n't know where to start , but ProtagonistA 's sure ProtagonistA 'll find ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA just does n't seem to enjoy ProtagonistA's things the way ProtagonistB do 
 ProtagonistA had been on the ship for so long that ProtagonistA had forgotten how to swim , and when ProtagonistA climbed into the water , ProtagonistA quickly began to sink 
 ProtagonistA would have drowned if not for the quick thinking of ProtagonistA's shipmate , who jumped into the water and pulled ProtagonistA to safety 
ProtagonistA had been preparing for this day for months 
 ProtagonistA had polished ProtagonistA's boots , brushed ProtagonistA's clothes , and made sure everything was perfect 
 ProtagonistA was going to meet the family of ProtagonistB 
 As ProtagonistA waited for ProtagonistB to arrive , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a bit nervous 
 ProtagonistA had never met someone so important before 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistB would remember ProtagonistA fondly , and ProtagonistA would always be welcome in the Province 
 Despite ProtagonistA's differences , ProtagonistA is a happy and well - adjusted child 
 ProtagonistA loves to play with ProtagonistA's friends and does n't let ProtagonistA's condition stop ProtagonistA from doing anything ProtagonistA wants to do 
 ProtagonistA had been fighting for ProtagonistA's life for what seemed like hours , and ProtagonistA was exhausted 
 ProtagonistA lunged forward and grabbed the cloak , yanking it out of ProtagonistB's hands 
 ProtagonistA grabbed ProtagonistB by the arm and pulled ProtagonistB to safety 
 ProtagonistA had saved ProtagonistB's life 
ProtagonistA had been thinking all night and ProtagonistA 'd been stumped ever since 
 ProtagonistA just could n't figure out what to get ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's birthday 
 ProtagonistA racked ProtagonistA's brain for ideas , but nothing came to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was starting to get desperate 
 ProtagonistA thought about what ProtagonistB liked and what ProtagonistB did n't like 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB loved being outdoors , so ProtagonistA thought about getting ProtagonistB something that would help ProtagonistB enjoy it even more 
 ProtagonistA considered a new bike or a kayak , but ProtagonistA was n't sure if ProtagonistB would use them enough to justify the cost 
 ProtagonistA was running out of time and ProtagonistA still did n't have a gift 
 Finally , ProtagonistA decided to just ask ProtagonistB what ProtagonistB wanted 
 ProtagonistA knew it was n't the most romantic option , but it was better than getting ProtagonistB's nothing 
 ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would make more time for ProtagonistB and that they would have many more happy years together 
ProtagonistA had driven for an entire day , and a whole day 's sleep , and had done nothing of note save to be driven to the place ProtagonistA was going to be raped 
 Afterwards , ProtagonistA drove home , feeling violated and traumatized 
 ProtagonistA would never be the same again 
ProtagonistA had been very wrong in ProtagonistA's belief that I would ever be with anyone , or marry anyone 
 ProtagonistA had seen me with other men , and ProtagonistA knew that I was not interested in them 
 ProtagonistA thought that I would never find someone who I could love , and who could love me back 
 ProtagonistA was wrong 
 ProtagonistA was wrong , and ProtagonistA is now happy for us 
ProtagonistA was sitting at ProtagonistA's typewriter , studying the words typed on the screen 
 ProtagonistA was trying to decide if they were good enough to send off to the publisher 
 ProtagonistA had been working on this book for months , and ProtagonistA did n't want to make any mistakes 
 ProtagonistA had been a writer for years , and ProtagonistA knew the importance of getting it right 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to disappoint ProtagonistA's fans 
 ProtagonistA was also worried about what the critics would say 
 ProtagonistA had to make a decision soon 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to keep the publisher waiting any longer 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and hit the send button 
ProtagonistA was out for a walk in the woods when ProtagonistA came across a bush 
 ProtagonistA had never seen ProtagonistB before , and ProtagonistA was n't sure whether ProtagonistA had ever seen ProtagonistB before 
 ProtagonistA was confused , but ProtagonistA decided to follow ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA followed ProtagonistB to a clearing in the woods , where ProtagonistB stopped and turned to face ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how ProtagonistB could know about ProtagonistA's quest , but ProtagonistA was intrigued 
 ProtagonistA agreed to let ProtagonistB help ProtagonistA , and together they set off into the woods , looking for the lost city of Atlantis 
ProtagonistA was sitting in the shadow of the building , and ProtagonistA's eyes had the kind of serenity of a few hours spent in a convincing dream 
 ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistA's life and how everything had led ProtagonistA to this moment 
 ProtagonistA was content and at peace with ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA has always considered ProtagonistA a bit of a ladies man 
 So , when ProtagonistA met ProtagonistA's fiancée , ProtagonistA was surprised to find ProtagonistA feeling more than just a passing interest 
 ProtagonistA was actually excited to be getting married 
 Now , as ProtagonistA stands at the altar , ProtagonistA ca n't help but reflect on how much ProtagonistA's life has changed in the last few months 
 ProtagonistA knows that this is just the beginning of a beautiful journey and ProtagonistA ca n't wait to see what the future holds 
ProtagonistA has never been to the movies before , but ProtagonistA 's always been involved in them 
 ProtagonistA 's a little nervous , but ProtagonistA 's excited to finally see one of ProtagonistA's films the way everyone else does 
 ProtagonistA gets to the theater and buys ProtagonistA's ticket 
 ProtagonistA walks in and finds a seat 
 ProtagonistA 's also really enjoying the experience of watching a movie in a theater 
 ProtagonistA laughs at all the jokes and cheers when the good guys win 
 When the movie is over , ProtagonistA is glad ProtagonistA finally decided to come to the movies 
 ProtagonistA was a very average looking guy , with brown hair and brown eyes 
 ProtagonistA worked in an office and lived in a small apartment 
 ProtagonistA did n't have any hobbies or interests , and ProtagonistA was generally quite boring 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to do something different 
 ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's job , sold ProtagonistA's apartment , and bought a one - way ticket to Japan 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to see the country , and ProtagonistA figured this was ProtagonistA's chance 
 ProtagonistA did n't know much about Japan , but ProtagonistA was excited to learn 
 ProtagonistA arrived in Tokyo and started exploring 
 ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA knew nothing about the culture or the language , but ProtagonistA was determined to learn 
 ProtagonistA started taking classes and studying hard 
 ProtagonistA made new friends and started to really enjoy ProtagonistA's new life 
 After a few years , ProtagonistA was fluent in Japanese and had a great job 
 ProtagonistA was happy and life was good 
ProtagonistA was sailing to San Diego , California , in a boat ProtagonistA called the Lusitania 
 ProtagonistA was looking forward to meeting the rich and famous there and was particularly delighted at the prospect 
ProtagonistA ran with alacrity through several miles of fields , forests , and meadows , bearing with ProtagonistA the great stuff of life : the apple , the bramble , the cherry - tree , the thorn - trees , and so many trees , some two hundred yards in circumference 
 ProtagonistA had been running for days , ever since ProtagonistA had heard the news that the world was ending 
 ProtagonistA had to get to the forest , to the place where it all began , before it was too late 
 ProtagonistA had no idea how much time ProtagonistA had left , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to hurry 
 ProtagonistA ran faster than ProtagonistA had ever run before , ProtagonistA's heart pounding in ProtagonistA's chest 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA would find when ProtagonistA got to the Forest , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to try 
 ProtagonistA plunged into the trees , calling out for the apple , the bramble , the cherry - tree , the thorn - trees 
 ProtagonistA searched for hours , but ProtagonistA could n't find them 
 ProtagonistA was about to give up , to accept that ProtagonistA was too late , when ProtagonistA heard a faint voice calling to ProtagonistA from the distance 
 ProtagonistA followed the voice until ProtagonistA came to a small clearing 
 ProtagonistA knew then that ProtagonistA had made it in time 
 ProtagonistA had saved the great stuff of life , and the world would go on 
ProtagonistA had been feeling off for a while 
 ProtagonistA was tired all the time and ProtagonistA's joints were aching 
 ProtagonistA had just assumed it was because ProtagonistA was getting older 
 But when ProtagonistA started having trouble breathing , ProtagonistA knew something was wrong 
 ProtagonistA went to see the doctor and found out that ProtagonistA was in the early stages of congestive heart failure 
 Now ProtagonistA just has to take it easy and follow ProtagonistA's treatment plan 
Once upon a time , in a deep , dark corner of the universe , there was ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA was a very old , very fat king 
 ProtagonistA ruled over ProtagonistA's kingdom with an iron fist , and ProtagonistA's subjects were terrified of ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was well past the age of twenty when ProtagonistA found the way to hell 
 ProtagonistA had been searching for it for years , ever since ProtagonistA had first heard the stories 
 Finally , after years of searching , ProtagonistA found a door deep in the forest 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was damned , so ProtagonistA stepped through the door 
 ProtagonistA kept walking , even though ProtagonistA wanted to turn back 
 ProtagonistA had come too far to turn back now 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA came to a throne made of bones 
 ProtagonistA knew this was the Devil , and ProtagonistA fell to ProtagonistA's knees 
 Please ,  ProtagonistA begged ,  let ProtagonistA go 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA was doing 
  And now ProtagonistA will suffer for it forever 
ProtagonistA was in a large room on the first floor of ProtagonistA's house 
 ProtagonistA was happy to have ProtagonistB close by 
ProtagonistA had already been through the worst stages of ProtagonistA's career , when ProtagonistA unexpectedly found ProtagonistA alone and facing the ultimatum of exposing the real source of the calamity ProtagonistA was in 
 ProtagonistA was only twenty - two , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to do something to save ProtagonistA and others from the same fate 
 ProtagonistA exposed ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB was brought to justice 
ProtagonistA has been working in the fields of London for a very long time , and of all the police officers here , to which ProtagonistA belongs , none , neither male nor female , is a match for anybody else 
 ProtagonistA 's the best of the best , and ProtagonistA's skills have been honed over the years to perfection 
 ProtagonistA 's the go - to guy when things get tough , and ProtagonistA always gets the job done 
ProtagonistA was always a tall girl , even when ProtagonistA was just six years old 
 ProtagonistA towered over ProtagonistA's classmates and always felt a bit out of place 
 But ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's height and never felt self - conscious about it 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was out playing with ProtagonistA's friends , ProtagonistA ran into ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was amazed and asked ProtagonistB how ProtagonistB got so tall 
 ProtagonistA was amazed 
 ProtagonistA had always thought ProtagonistA was the only tall girl in the world 
 But now ProtagonistA knew that there were others like ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was happy to have found someone who understood ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA was walking through town on the left hand side of the road when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so confused and did n't know what to think 
 ProtagonistA just stood there and stared at ProtagonistB until ProtagonistB finally noticed ProtagonistA and gave ProtagonistA an awkward smile 
 ProtagonistA quickly turned away and continued on ProtagonistA's way , ProtagonistA's mind racing with questions 
 ProtagonistA was a very average looking guy 
 ProtagonistA had a wife and two kids 
 ProtagonistA worked at a factory 
 ProtagonistA was a very average guy 
 One day , ProtagonistA won the lottery 
 ProtagonistA became a millionaire overnight 
 ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's job and started living the life of a rich man 
 ProtagonistA bought a big house and a fancy car 
 ProtagonistA went on luxurious vacations 
 ProtagonistA was living the life of ProtagonistA's dreams 
 But ProtagonistA was not happy 
 ProtagonistA was always worried that someone would find out that ProtagonistA was a fraud 
 ProtagonistA was always worried that ProtagonistA's money would run out 
ProtagonistA had been in prison for years , and ProtagonistA was getting tired of it 
 ProtagonistA often had nightmares about being back in the war , or about being executed 
 So , when ProtagonistA was given the chance to participate in a study about sleep , ProtagonistA jumped at the chance 
 At first , ProtagonistA thought the study was a joke 
 But after a few nights of good sleep , ProtagonistA started to feel better 
 ProtagonistA started to feel like a human again 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider 
 ProtagonistA was the only one of ProtagonistA's kind 
 ProtagonistA was a total of sixty - four people , and no one knew quite what ProtagonistB was 
 But ProtagonistA was different 
 ProtagonistA was smart 
 ProtagonistA was a million times as smart as anybody else 
 And ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew how to get into the place , and how to start 
 ProtagonistA was the only one who knew 
 And ProtagonistA was going to use that knowledge to take over the world 
ProtagonistA was sitting at the table , listening to the conversation around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was in the most northeasterly part of Maine and it was the summer solstice 
 ProtagonistA heard two men talking about ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA decided ProtagonistA would go look for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had nothing better to do and ProtagonistA liked the idea of exploring the woods 
 ProtagonistA told the men ProtagonistA would go look for ProtagonistB and they gave ProtagonistA directions to where ProtagonistB was last seen 
 ProtagonistA set off into the woods , following the directions the men had given ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA searched for ProtagonistB all day but ProtagonistA could n't find ProtagonistB 
 It was getting dark and ProtagonistA was getting tired 
 ProtagonistA decided to go back to the men and tell them ProtagonistA could n't find ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA went back to ProtagonistA's table and sat down 
 ProtagonistA was tired but ProtagonistA felt good knowing ProtagonistA had tried to help ProtagonistB 
When ProtagonistA was in ProtagonistA's seventies , ProtagonistA was walking ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had lived a long and interesting life , and ProtagonistA loved to share ProtagonistA's stories with ProtagonistB 
 One day , as they were walking , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC walking towards them 
 As ProtagonistC got closer , ProtagonistA could see that ProtagonistC was carrying a gun 
 ProtagonistA reached into ProtagonistA's pocket and pulled out ProtagonistA's wallet 
 ProtagonistA handed it to ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistC took it and ran away 
 ProtagonistA walked home with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB what had happened 
 ProtagonistA did n't tell anyone else about the robbery 
 ProtagonistA was embarrassed and ProtagonistA did n't want to make a fuss 
 But ProtagonistA always remembered it , and ProtagonistA always thought about what could have happened 
 ProtagonistA did n't seem to notice or care , ProtagonistA just stared at the screen with a blank expression 
 When the police tried to talk to ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA did n't respond , ProtagonistA just kept staring at the television 
 It was as if ProtagonistA was in a trance 
The night before ProtagonistA drowned , ProtagonistA had a dream , as it were 
 ProtagonistA dreamt that ProtagonistA was on a small boat in the middle of a vast ocean 
 ProtagonistA was alone on the boat and ProtagonistA felt a sense of peace and contentment 
 ProtagonistA struggled to swim to the surface but the weight of ProtagonistA's clothes pulled ProtagonistA down 
 ProtagonistA could see the light of the surface getting further and further away and then everything went black 
 ProtagonistA had a feeling that it was a warning and that ProtagonistA should be careful the next time ProtagonistA went swimming 
 But ProtagonistA did n't listen and the next day ProtagonistA drowned 
ProtagonistA had not changed one bit since the day ProtagonistA had to flee ProtagonistA's homeland 
 ProtagonistA still remembered the day vividly 
 ProtagonistA was getting ready for work when ProtagonistA heard a knock at the door 
 ProtagonistA opened it to find two men in suits 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what was going on , but ProtagonistA went with them 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what was going on 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to leave , but ProtagonistA did n't have a choice 
 ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what was going to happen to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't know if ProtagonistA would ever see ProtagonistA's home or ProtagonistA's family again 
ProtagonistA was a professional mover 
 ProtagonistA had been in the business for years and had developed a well - oiled system for getting people 's belongings from one place to another 
 ProtagonistA had tried everything to get rid of them , but nothing seemed to work 
 One day , ProtagonistA was in the middle of a move when the Living showed up again 
 ProtagonistA started chasing them around , but they were always one step ahead of ProtagonistA 
 Finally , ProtagonistA had had enough 
 ProtagonistA decided to use ProtagonistA's own supernatural abilities to fight back 
 ProtagonistA turned into a giant bird and started flying after the Living 
 ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had finally been able to put an end to their shenanigans 
ProtagonistA , descended the aisle of the château of the Riveuilles ; an imposing house of splendour and distinction , from which ProtagonistA received the name of Richelieu , or Richelodio , or , perhaps , of Lord Bertram 
 ProtagonistA was a tall , stately man , with a long , white beard and a severe expression 
 ProtagonistA wore a black cape and carried a cane 
 ProtagonistA walked with a purposeful stride , as if ProtagonistA knew where ProtagonistA was going and what ProtagonistA was going to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't look left or right , but straight ahead , as if ProtagonistA could see through the walls of the chateau 
 ProtagonistA ignored them all , as if they were not worth ProtagonistA's time 
 ProtagonistA had important business to attend to 
 ProtagonistA walked down the long , winding staircase to the lowest level of the chateau 
 There , in a small , dark room , ProtagonistA found what ProtagonistA was looking for : a secret passage that led to the outside 
 ProtagonistA opened the door and stepped into the darkness 
ProtagonistA had always looked up to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistB was everything that ProtagonistA was n't : outgoing , popular , and smart 
 So when ProtagonistA saw the statue of ProtagonistB with their father , ascending the balustrade at Westminster , ProtagonistA felt dismayed and intellectually disgraced 
ProtagonistA woke early , and ProtagonistA woke often , as if ProtagonistA had been awake forever , until it was too late 
 ProtagonistA was always tired , but ProtagonistA could never sleep 
 ProtagonistA would lie in bed for hours , trying to drift off , but ProtagonistA's mind would never shut off 
 ProtagonistA tried everything to get some relief , but nothing worked 
 ProtagonistA even saw a doctor , but they could n't find anything wrong with ProtagonistA 
 Eventually , ProtagonistA just stopped trying to sleep 
 ProtagonistA would stay up all night , watching TV or reading , and then ProtagonistA would sleep during the day 
 ProtagonistA was always tired , and ProtagonistA's eyes were always red and swollen 
 And then , one day , ProtagonistA just did n't wake up 
 ProtagonistA is ready to go now 
 But before ProtagonistA leaves , ProtagonistA wants to make sure that everything is in its place 
 ProtagonistA wants to leave ProtagonistA's work area as clean as possible , so that the next person can use it without any problems 
 ProtagonistA knows that ProtagonistA's work is important , and ProtagonistA does n't want to cause any inconvenience for anyone 
ProtagonistA had chosen the kingdom of Heaven out of all creation ; and the power of the Holy One of Israel had shone forth in every way , to please ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was happy and content to spend eternity in this beautiful place 
ProtagonistA had a dream the night before ProtagonistA drowned 
 In the dream , ProtagonistA was walking along a beach 
 ProtagonistA walked for a while , until ProtagonistA came to a spot where the sand was damp and the waves were crashing harder 
 ProtagonistA stopped and looked out at the water 
 In the distance , ProtagonistA could see a large wave coming towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA should run , but ProtagonistA could n't move 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and waited for the impact 
 ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes and saw that ProtagonistA was still standing on the beach 
 ProtagonistA looked down and saw that ProtagonistA was transparent 
 ProtagonistA could see the sand and the water through ProtagonistA's body 
 ProtagonistA was a ghost 
ProtagonistA had never felt this way before 
 ProtagonistA had always been a strong , independent man , but now ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's heart in ProtagonistA's hands 
 ProtagonistA had just lost ProtagonistA's job and ProtagonistA's home , and ProtagonistA had no idea where to go or what to do 
 ProtagonistA walked the streets of Croydon , feeling lost and alone 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where to turn or who to trust 
 ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA was at the end of ProtagonistA's rope 
ProtagonistA , with ProtagonistC , at ProtagonistA's side , rode out into the great wide plain of Phlegethon , where ProtagonistA found the rest of ProtagonistA's family in the company of Mrs
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistC that ProtagonistA had not , but that ProtagonistA had heard tell of them , and that they were said to be very fierce creatures 
 ProtagonistA did not think that this was a good idea , but ProtagonistD said that it would be quite safe , and that ProtagonistD would go with them 
 So , ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistD set out on their quest to find a dragon 
 ProtagonistA called out to the dragon , and it slowly opened its eyes 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistD quickly grabbed ProtagonistC and ran out of the cave , with the dragon close behind them 
ProtagonistA stood on the horizon of the world , a proud and proud man , but one who knew ProtagonistA had nothing to fear but might actually have some advantage over a very large and very dangerous enemy 
 ProtagonistA had been planning this day for years , ever since ProtagonistA had first learned of the existence of the enemy 
 ProtagonistA had been preparing for this day , and ProtagonistA was ready 
 ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's people were the last remaining humans on earth , and they were all that stood between the enemy and complete domination 
 ProtagonistA had been working on it for years , and ProtagonistA was confident that it would work 
 ProtagonistA was going to lead ProtagonistA's people to victory , and ProtagonistA was going to destroy the enemy 
In the year 1251 ProtagonistA loomed over London , and what was the matter with ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistA had been a giant among men , a true force to be reckoned with 
 But now , in ProtagonistA's old age , ProtagonistA was a shadow of ProtagonistA's former self 
 ProtagonistA's once mighty frame was now bent and frail , and ProtagonistA's once bright eyes were now dull and listless 
 ProtagonistA will tell you how it came to pass , said ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA stammered : ProtagonistB had been ill for some time and the king had been by ProtagonistB's side day and night 
ProtagonistA was a man who enjoyed the art of murdering 
 ProtagonistA was a cold - blooded killer who took pleasure in ending the lives of others 
 ProtagonistA was a skilled killer who was never caught by the authorities 
 ProtagonistA always managed to make ProtagonistA's victims look like they had died of natural causes 
 ProtagonistA had many victims over the years 
 ProtagonistA then went on to kill several more women who ProtagonistA met in similar circumstances 
 ProtagonistA was a sociopath who did n't care about anyone but ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC 
 They began dating and ProtagonistA even began to think about settling down with ProtagonistC 
 However , ProtagonistA could n't shake ProtagonistA's murderous ways and eventually killed ProtagonistC too 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA would never be able to change and that ProtagonistA was doomed to a life of killing 
ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's chair on the left , reading a letter ; but the letter was full of facts that were interesting to ProtagonistA , such as , ProtagonistA's uncle was a man of coarse manners , and , in consequence of the poverty of his household , very few persons in its neighbourhood were wealthy , and in whom ProtagonistA had any feeling of sympathy 
 ProtagonistA was , therefore , quite surprised when ProtagonistA read that ProtagonistA's uncle had left ProtagonistA a large sum of money 
ProtagonistA sat in the sun and ProtagonistA's mind busy 
 ProtagonistA had always been a thinker , and ProtagonistA liked to think about things that were important to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had never been one to just sit and stare at the world around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was always looking for ways to improve ProtagonistA's life and the lives of those around ProtagonistA 
 Today , ProtagonistA was thinking about ProtagonistA's family and how ProtagonistA could make them proud of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be a good husband and father , and ProtagonistA wanted to make a difference in the world 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA could make a difference if ProtagonistA just had the chance 
 ProtagonistA was with ProtagonistA's girlfriend at the time and they were both really enjoying themselves 
ProtagonistA was the most famous and adored character in the world 
One day ProtagonistA came to Washington , and , being highly desirous of seeing the grounds of the new Capitol , refused to leave until ProtagonistA had seen them into which the hall had been enlarged for the new institution ; and if ProtagonistA had been right , ProtagonistA should be justified in saying that ProtagonistA had never seen anything so amiss 
 ProtagonistA 's too old 
 ProtagonistA has your eyes 
ProtagonistA stopped dead in ProtagonistA's tracks , and then ProtagonistA tried to find the source of the sound , and it just was n't there 
 ProtagonistA looked around , confused and a little scared , but there was nothing to be seen 
 ProtagonistA started to walk forward again , but stopped when ProtagonistA heard the sound again 
 ProtagonistA spun around , but still saw nothing 
 ProtagonistA was starting to freak out now 
 What was going on ? Was ProtagonistA going crazy ? Just as ProtagonistA was about to start running , ProtagonistA heard the sound again , this time right next to ProtagonistA's ear 
 ProtagonistA yelped and fell to the ground , cowering in fear 
 Then ProtagonistA felt something touch ProtagonistA's cheek , and ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes to see a small , furry creature standing next to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA let out a sigh of relief and got to ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head and started to walk home , wondering what that creature was and how it had made that sound 
 ProtagonistA walked for miles and miles , until ProtagonistA came to a dark forest 
 ProtagonistA had never been in a forest before , and ProtagonistA was a little scared 
 But ProtagonistA kept walking , until ProtagonistA came to a clearing 
 ProtagonistA had never seen a house like this before 
 ProtagonistA knocked on the door , and a voice said ,  Who is it ?  ProtagonistA said ,  It 's ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA 'm just walking after dark and ProtagonistA saw your house 
ProtagonistA managed to keep ProtagonistA's head and face up , to enjoy the moment 
 ProtagonistA took a deep breath and closed ProtagonistA's eyes , savoring the moment 
ProtagonistA had been driving a truck for years , and ProtagonistA had seen a lot of different people on the road 
 ProtagonistA always made it a point to be friendly to everyone , because ProtagonistA never knew when ProtagonistA might need a friend on the road 
 One day , ProtagonistA was sitting in a truck stop , having a cup of coffee and talking to some of the other drivers 
 ProtagonistA got to talking to ProtagonistB , and they began to talk about what they would do if they won the lottery 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA would buy a truck stop , so that ProtagonistA could help other drivers like ProtagonistA 
 A few weeks later , ProtagonistA won the lottery 
 And , true to ProtagonistA's word , ProtagonistA bought a truck stop 
 ProtagonistA was able to help a lot of other drivers , and ProtagonistA made a lot of new friends 
ProtagonistA had always been a dreamer 
 As a child , ProtagonistA would lay in bed at night and stare up at the stars , dreaming of the adventures ProtagonistA would one day go on 
 But ProtagonistA never gave up on ProtagonistA's dreams 
 ProtagonistA continued to chase after them , even when everyone around ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA to give up 
 And then one day , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
 Encouraged by ProtagonistB's interest , ProtagonistA took a risk and shared ProtagonistA's greatest dream with ProtagonistB 
 And so ProtagonistA took a deep breath and drank to the full 
 ProtagonistA let ProtagonistA dream and hope and wish for the impossible 
ProtagonistA had been walking on the ice for hours , ever since ProtagonistA had seen the lights of the town in the distance 
 ProtagonistA was so close to safety 
 ProtagonistA fought and fought , but eventually ProtagonistA was pulled under the ice and drowned 
 ProtagonistA was a very average looking guy , with brown hair and brown eyes 
 ProtagonistA worked in an office and lived in a small apartment 
 One day , ProtagonistA won the lottery 
 ProtagonistA was suddenly a millionaire 
 ProtagonistA was happy and life was good 
ProtagonistA had seen a lot in ProtagonistA's life , but nothing had prepared ProtagonistA for the fear ProtagonistA felt when ProtagonistA saw the thing in the woods 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to get away from it , but ProtagonistA's feet seemed frozen to the ground 
 ProtagonistA tried to scream , but no sound would come out 
 ProtagonistA collapsed to the ground , shaking and crying 
 ProtagonistA had never been so scared in ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was afraid of the dark , of heights , of spiders , of just about anything you could think of 
 But ProtagonistA had never been truly afraid until now 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA could n't keep living like this 
 ProtagonistA had to face ProtagonistA's fears if ProtagonistA ever wanted to be truly happy 
 With that , ProtagonistA began ProtagonistA's journey to conquer ProtagonistA's fears , one by one 
 ProtagonistA had always been interested in the world and what was going on in it , and this was a particularly interesting story 
 ProtagonistA was very concerned for the safety of the people involved and ProtagonistA hoped that the situation would be resolved quickly and peacefully 
 ProtagonistA never really believed ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB and so ProtagonistA went along with it 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but ProtagonistC was so insistent that ProtagonistA finally agreed 
ProtagonistA had been shopping online for a new TV for weeks 
 ProtagonistA had finally found the perfect one on Wal - Mart 's website 
 The price was unbeatable , so ProtagonistA decided to buy it 
 ProtagonistA clicked on the  buy now  button and filled out ProtagonistA's information 
 The next thing ProtagonistA knew , ProtagonistA was on the phone with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so disappointed 
 ProtagonistA had been looking forward to having a new TV to watch ProtagonistA's favorite shows 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's time and hung up the phone 
 A few days later , ProtagonistA was browsing the Wal - Mart website again

 ProtagonistA was getting angry 
 In this city , ProtagonistA would be safe from the chaos and destruction that had befallen the earth 
 ProtagonistA was not sure how ProtagonistA was supposed to find this city , but ProtagonistA trusted that the gods would guide ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA set out on ProtagonistA's journey , and after many days of travel , ProtagonistA came to a large desert 
 ProtagonistA had been walking for days , and ProtagonistA was tired and thirsty 
 ProtagonistA saw a mirage of a city in the distance , and ProtagonistA started to walk towards it 
 As ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA realized that the city was not a mirage , but it was real 
 ProtagonistA entered the city and was surprised to see that it was empty 
 ProtagonistA walked through the streets , and it was eerily quiet 
 ProtagonistA eventually came to a large square , and in the center of the square was a large statue of a man 
 ProtagonistA walked up to the statue and realized that it was ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was the king of this city 
 ProtagonistA looked around and saw that there were no other people 
 ProtagonistA was the only one 
 ProtagonistA was the only one left in the world 
 ProtagonistA was the last man on earth 
 ProtagonistA was always so full of life and energy , and ProtagonistA always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face 
ProtagonistA rose early that morning , lifting ProtagonistA's ten - pound hammer from the table before he and pounding the ground 
 ProtagonistA had been working on this house for weeks , and ProtagonistA was finally starting to see some progress 
 ProtagonistA worked tirelessly , hammering in nails and sawing boards 
 ProtagonistA was so focused on ProtagonistA's work that ProtagonistA did n't hear the car pull up behind ProtagonistA 
 I'm working on the house ,  ProtagonistA replied , as if it was the most obvious thing in the world 
 I know , but ProtagonistA 've always wanted to build ProtagonistA's own house 
 And now ProtagonistA finally have the chance 
 ProtagonistA know , but ProtagonistA ca n't help it 
 ProtagonistA 've always wanted to build ProtagonistA's own house , and ProtagonistA 'm not going to let anything stop ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB's drive away before turning back to ProtagonistA's work 
 ProtagonistA knew it was n't going to be easy , but ProtagonistA was determined to build ProtagonistA's dream house 
 The first thing I ever thought of ProtagonistA was that ProtagonistA was a holy man and a good man 
 ProtagonistA always had a smile on ProtagonistA's face and was always willing to help others 
ProtagonistA was once a highly respected merchant 
 ProtagonistA was an expert in the fine arts of navigation , shipbuilding , and explosives 
 ProtagonistA was also highly skilled in the operation of machinery 
 ProtagonistA was a highly respected member of the community and was always willing to help out when needed 
 ProtagonistA had been a man of the sea for as long as ProtagonistA could remember , and ProtagonistA had never been without a ship 
 But now , ProtagonistA was without a ship , and ProtagonistA was without a crew 
 ProtagonistA was adrift in the world , and ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA belonged 
 ProtagonistA had always been a man of action , and ProtagonistA had always been able to take care of ProtagonistA 
 But now , ProtagonistA felt lost and alone 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where to go or what to do 
 ProtagonistA was a man without a home , and ProtagonistA did n't know how to find one 
 ProtagonistA had only brought fifteen dollars with ProtagonistA , intending to use the rest of ProtagonistA's money to buy some lunch before heading back home 
 Now , ProtagonistA would have to find a way to come up with the additional ten dollars somehow 
 ProtagonistA thought about asking ProtagonistB to let ProtagonistA pay the remainder later , but ProtagonistA wasn ' t sure if ProtagonistB would agree to that 
 ProtagonistA also considered asking some of the other people who were waiting in line behind ProtagonistA if they would be willing to loan ProtagonistA the money , but ProtagonistA didn ' t want to be a burden to anyone 
 Just then , ProtagonistA heard someone calling ProtagonistA's name 
ProtagonistA was a simple man , and ProtagonistA found great comfort in reading 
 ProtagonistA was particularly fond of reading about science , and ProtagonistA was currently working ProtagonistA's way through an appendix to the first edition of The Origin of Species 
 ProtagonistA found the book fascinating , and ProtagonistA loved learning about the natural world 
 However , ProtagonistA was also a very practical man , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA needed to make use of ProtagonistA's time wisely 
 Therefore , even though ProtagonistA was often so engrossed in ProtagonistA's reading that ProtagonistA forgot about the world around ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA always made sure to take breaks and get some work done 
 On this particular afternoon , ProtagonistA was hard at work 
 It was the middle of January , and ProtagonistA was determined to get as much done as possible before the cold weather really set in 
 ProtagonistA was chopping wood , carrying water , and doing all the other chores that needed to be done around the farm 
 However , ProtagonistA always made sure to take a break to read a few pages of ProtagonistA's book 
 As ProtagonistA worked , ProtagonistA thought about the world around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA thought about the animals that ProtagonistA had read about in ProtagonistA's book and how they lived their lives 
 ProtagonistA thought about the plants and how they grew 
 ProtagonistA even thought about the stars and the universe beyond 
 ProtagonistA was a simple man , but ProtagonistA had a complex mind , and ProtagonistA was always thinking about the world around ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was tired , but ProtagonistA was also content 
 ProtagonistA had accomplished a lot that day , and ProtagonistA had also learned a lot 
 It was an afternoon well spent , and ProtagonistA was grateful for that 
The first time I saw ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was dancing through the streets of New York in a red hot mess of a car and a packed black crowd of people , mostly women and children 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a bright red suit and a top hat , and ProtagonistA had a cane in one hand and a cigar in the other 
 ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA was having the time of ProtagonistA's life , and the crowd was loving it 
ProtagonistA was a dull boy , but not to the point of being a loner , except in the locality where ProtagonistA had an uncle , an aunt , and a cousin ; and as ProtagonistA was such a person , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA quite agreeable to everybody , even to the great majority of ProtagonistA's elders 
 One day , while ProtagonistA was out walking , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
  ProtagonistA was so pleased with this compliment that ProtagonistA went home and told ProtagonistA's uncle about it 
 ProtagonistA 're still just a dull boy 
One morning , after the close of our first term , when the pain on my hand was beginning to subside , ProtagonistA issued a paper which ProtagonistA supposed to be a communication from his Majesty , for it bore the stamp of his Majesty 's office , and was filled with the seal of the State 
ProtagonistA had just lost ProtagonistA's job 
 ProtagonistA had been working at the same company for over 20 years and was devastated 
 ProtagonistA did not know whether ProtagonistA should rejoice or cry 
 ProtagonistA had been thinking about retiring soon anyway , but ProtagonistA had not planned on it being so soon 
 ProtagonistA decided to take some time to think about what ProtagonistA wanted to do next 
 ProtagonistA was not sure if ProtagonistA wanted to retire or look for another job 
 ProtagonistA was also not sure if ProtagonistA wanted to stay in the same town or move to a new one 
 ProtagonistA had a lot of decisions to make and was not sure where to start 
ProtagonistA always loved adventure stories 
 As a young boy , ProtagonistA would often dream of being the hero of ProtagonistA's own story 
 In ProtagonistA's mind , ProtagonistA would picture ProtagonistA climbing mountains , sailing the seas , and fighting fierce dragons 
 One night , ProtagonistA went to bed early and had the most amazing dream 
 In ProtagonistA's dream , ProtagonistA was the captain of a ship and ProtagonistA was sailing around the world 
 ProtagonistA visited so many amazing places and met so many interesting people 
 When ProtagonistA woke up the next morning , ProtagonistA was so excited to tell ProtagonistA's family and friends all about it 
 ProtagonistA knew that they would be just as amazed as ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA was sure that ProtagonistA's dream would come true one day 
ProtagonistA was at the bar , nursing a beer and feeling sorry for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was just about to take a sip of ProtagonistA's beer when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB sitting at the other end of the bar 
 ProtagonistA felt a sudden surge of confidence and ProtagonistA decided to go talk to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA walked up to ProtagonistB and put ProtagonistA's hand on the glass , and slowly , with a gentle pressure , leaned it to the side 
  Can ProtagonistA buy ProtagonistB a drink ?  ProtagonistA asked 
 ProtagonistA never would have had the courage to talk to ProtagonistB if it had n't been for that one simple act 
ProtagonistA was a new student at the school 
 ProtagonistA was shy and withdrawn and felt out of place 
 ProtagonistA was not sure why ProtagonistA had been chosen to attend the school , but ProtagonistA was determined to make the best of it 
 ProtagonistA was not sure what they were saying , but ProtagonistA could tell it was about ProtagonistA's name and nationality 
 ProtagonistA tried to ignore it , but it was hard 
 ProtagonistA was grateful when the school year came to an end and ProtagonistA could go home 
 ProtagonistA was looking forward to starting fresh in the fall , but ProtagonistA was not sure ProtagonistA would be able to forget the whispers 
ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA knew the way to heaven but in fact ProtagonistA knew nothing at all 
 ProtagonistA had always been a good person , ProtagonistA went to church every Sunday , and ProtagonistA tithed 10 % of ProtagonistA's income 
 But one day , ProtagonistA met a man who told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA was wrong 
 ProtagonistA asked the man to tell ProtagonistA more , and the man did 
 ProtagonistA had always thought that was a load of nonsense , but now ProtagonistA was starting to believe it 
 ProtagonistA did as the man said , and ProtagonistA felt a peace come over ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had finally found the way to heaven 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of an outsider 
 ProtagonistA was never quite sure why , but ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA did n't quite fit in 
 So when ProtagonistA started hearing ProtagonistA's name mentioned in whispers , ProtagonistA did n't know what to think 
 And then one day , ProtagonistA overheard two people talking about ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA had finally found a place where ProtagonistA belonged , but now ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA was still an outsider 
 But then ProtagonistA realized that it did n't matter what other people thought of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was happy with who ProtagonistA was , and that was all that mattered 
There was ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was ninety years old , and ProtagonistA looked very old 
 ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's rocking chair on the porch of ProtagonistA's house , watching the sun set 
 ProtagonistA was ready to go to bed , but ProtagonistA wanted to watch the sun set first 
 ProtagonistA had lived a long and happy life 
 ProtagonistA had a wife and two children , and ProtagonistA was proud of them 
 ProtagonistA had worked hard all ProtagonistA's life , and now ProtagonistA was enjoying ProtagonistA's retirement 
 ProtagonistA had many friends , and ProtagonistA loved spending time with them 
 ProtagonistA was happy to be alive , and ProtagonistA was grateful for all that ProtagonistA had 
 ProtagonistA was looking forward to the future , and ProtagonistA was excited to see what it would bring 
ProtagonistA was taking a walk one day when ProtagonistA suddenly realized that ProtagonistA had been born 
 ProtagonistA was amazed at how much had changed since ProtagonistA was born 
 ProtagonistA saw people walking around in strange clothes , cars driving by , and buildings that were taller than ProtagonistA could have ever imagined 
 ProtagonistA also realized that ProtagonistA did n't know anything about ProtagonistA's life before ProtagonistA was born 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA came from or who ProtagonistA's parents were 
 ProtagonistA was scared and did n't know what to do 
ProtagonistA comes at night , the terror of ProtagonistA's lips , limber and voice , stronger than the deathbringer that lay before ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's teeth are black from blood 
 ProtagonistA was the one that the others whispered about , the one that they said came in the night and took people away 
 One night , ProtagonistA came for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA came up to ProtagonistB and grabbed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB away and no one ever saw ProtagonistB again 
The first time I met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was lying on a hospital table in the middle of London 
 I asked ProtagonistA what was wrong and ProtagonistA told me ProtagonistA was having a heart attack 
ProtagonistA had ProtagonistB when ProtagonistA was five years old 
 ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA would take ProtagonistB everywhere with ProtagonistA 
 One day , when ProtagonistA was playing with ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA accidentally dropped ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB broke into pieces 
 ProtagonistA cried and cried for hours 
 ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA would always remember the good times ProtagonistB had together 
ProtagonistA had always loved books 
 As a child , ProtagonistA would spend hours in the library , poring over the musty tomes and dreaming of the adventures ProtagonistA would have 
 Now , as an adult , ProtagonistA still found solace in books 
 Tonight , ProtagonistA was sitting in ProtagonistA's study in the Court of the Tuileries , looking at an old and heavy book which was lying upon a table 
 ProtagonistA had been reading it all evening , and was now getting ready to go to bed 
 ProtagonistA got up to answer it , and found a man standing there , dressed in black 
 ProtagonistA knew what it contained 
 ProtagonistA sat down and opened the envelope 
 ProtagonistA stared at the paper for a moment , then crumpled it up and threw it into the fire 
 ProtagonistA went to bed , and died in ProtagonistA's sleep 
ProtagonistA stood up from the log ProtagonistA 'd been sitting on and peered out from the dark cover of ProtagonistA's tea cup 
 ProtagonistA 'd been sitting in the same spot for hours , waiting for ProtagonistA's prey 
 ProtagonistA was patient , though , and ProtagonistA always got ProtagonistA's prey in the end 
 Tonight , ProtagonistA was waiting for a deer 
 ProtagonistA had seen one earlier in the day , and ProtagonistA was sure it would come back to the same spot 
 ProtagonistA was right 
 ProtagonistA was a good shot , and the deer went down 
 ProtagonistA approached the deer cautiously 
One day , soon after ProtagonistA had become a full - grown man , Mr
 ProtagonistA had never heard of ProtagonistB 
 No , sir , ProtagonistA have n't ,  ProtagonistA replied 
 ProtagonistA had always been interested in philosophy and ProtagonistA had never heard of ProtagonistB before 
 ProtagonistA went to the library and found a book of ProtagonistB's writings 
 ProtagonistA read it eagerly , and was soon deep in thought , trying to understand the complex ideas contained within 
 ProtagonistA became a regular reader of ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA's ideas began to change 
 ProtagonistA started to see the world in a different way , and to question things that ProtagonistA had always taken for granted 
 ProtagonistA became a thinker and a philosopher ProtagonistA , and people started to listen to ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA spoke 
 ProtagonistA was making a difference in the world , just as the original Luke the Great had done 
ProtagonistA had a rough life 
 ProtagonistA was never able to trust anyone , even in the most extreme times of ProtagonistA's suffering 
 ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA had to fend for ProtagonistA 
 Even when ProtagonistA was at ProtagonistA's lowest , ProtagonistA never felt like anyone could help ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA always felt like ProtagonistA was alone in the world 
 ProtagonistA was always a bit of a homebody , so it was no surprise that ProtagonistA never left England 
 ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a dreamer , and ProtagonistA's list of places visited was a testament to that 
 ProtagonistA had visited all sorts of places , from the pyramids of Egypt to the Great Wall of China 
 It was a bittersweet moment for ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had finally been able to visit all the places on ProtagonistA's list 
ProtagonistA had been dreaming of snow since ProtagonistA had been a boy 
 ProtagonistA would lie in bed at night and imagine what it would be like to walk through the snow , feeling the cold air on ProtagonistA's face and the crunch of the snow under ProtagonistA's feet 
 ProtagonistA woke up one morning to find the ground covered in a thick layer of snow 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA's eyes ! ProtagonistA quickly got dressed and went outside to play 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to finally be able to experience snow firsthand 
 ProtagonistA made a snowman , threw snowballs at ProtagonistA's friends , and went sledding down the hill 
ProtagonistA had been driving for hours , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel tired 
 ProtagonistA had been on the road for days , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA was going insane 
 ProtagonistA could see the wheel in front of ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA could n't keep ProtagonistA's hands on it 
 ProtagonistA would start to drift off , and then ProtagonistA would jerk the wheel to keep the car on the road 
 ProtagonistA was starting to fall asleep , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA needed to stop soon 
 ProtagonistA was getting too tired to drive 
 ProtagonistA finally saw a sign for a motel , and ProtagonistA pulled into the parking lot 
 ProtagonistA got a room and went to bed , but ProtagonistA could n't sleep 
 ProtagonistA kept seeing the wheel in front of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA would jerk awake every time ProtagonistA started to drift off 
 ProtagonistA was starting to lose ProtagonistA's mind 
 ProtagonistA needed to get some sleep , but ProtagonistA could n't 
 ProtagonistA was starting to go insane 
 ProtagonistA never told anyone about ProtagonistA's gift , because ProtagonistA knew that they would never believe ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was content to live ProtagonistA's life quietly , until one day when ProtagonistA had a vision of a terrible future 
 In ProtagonistA's vision , ProtagonistA saw the world being consumed by a great fire , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to do something to stop it 
 ProtagonistA went to the local library and did some research on the future 
 ProtagonistA found out that there was going to be a big fire in the city , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to warn people 
 ProtagonistA went to the city hall and told ProtagonistB about ProtagonistA's vision 
 ProtagonistA had saved the city , and ProtagonistA was hailed as a hero 
There was once a boy who was known to everyone but ProtagonistB by ProtagonistA's given name – a boy called Noah , who was supposed to have been born in the year 1224 , on the very day that ProtagonistA was , according to some versions , murdered by a demon 
 ProtagonistA had been a happy , normal boy until the day that the demon came for ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was there , just as ProtagonistB had feared , and ProtagonistA was in terrible shape 
 ProtagonistA died shortly after , never having recovered from the torture that ProtagonistA had endured 
It was the devil 's day , Cecil ! Ai n't gon na happen again , said ProtagonistA to the last man ProtagonistA saw of the forgotten white - bearded beauty of the East India ocean 
 ProtagonistA knew that there was someone up there , but ProtagonistA did n't know who it was 
 ProtagonistA had seen the light before , but never this close 
 ProtagonistA was about to go back to ProtagonistA's boat when ProtagonistA heard a voice 
 ProtagonistA could n't make out the words , but the voice was beautiful 
 ProtagonistA climbed up the rocks to get a better view , and when ProtagonistA got to the top , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA was so mesmerized by ProtagonistB's beauty that ProtagonistA forgot to be afraid 
 ProtagonistA could see the devil in ProtagonistB's eyes , but ProtagonistA did n't care 
 ProtagonistA was under ProtagonistB's spell 
  ProtagonistA did n't know what to say 
 ProtagonistA was under ProtagonistB's spell , and ProtagonistA could n't think 
  ProtagonistA did n't resist 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was doomed 
 ProtagonistA sat down and looked at ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA wondered what ProtagonistC was thinking about 
 ProtagonistA smiled back at ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA was happy to be there with ProtagonistC 
 One day , ProtagonistA went to ProtagonistB's house to surprise ProtagonistB with a picnic lunch , but ProtagonistB was not home 
 ProtagonistA waited for a while , but ProtagonistB still did not come home 
 ProtagonistA decided to leave and come back another time 
 When ProtagonistA got home , ProtagonistA found a note from ProtagonistB saying that ProtagonistB had broken up with ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA did n't believe ProtagonistB at first , but soon enough ProtagonistA started to see the signs 
 ProtagonistA was gaining more and more power , and people were following ProtagonistA blindly 
 ProtagonistA was on the verge of taking over the universe when something unforeseen happened 
The first time I met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was in the kitchen of ProtagonistA's Nantucket house , stirring a pot of oysters and staring in the mirror 
 ProtagonistA was a retired lobsterman and an avid fisherman 
ProtagonistA was dead , and ProtagonistA had a new king 
 ProtagonistA had been dead for years , and ProtagonistA's kingdom had been taken over by a new king 
ProtagonistA was a man , or at least ProtagonistA looked like one , of unquestionable fortune 
 ProtagonistA had a successful career , ProtagonistB , and two healthy children 
 But despite all of ProtagonistA's blessings , ProtagonistA was unhappy 
 ProtagonistA was constantly worried about money and ProtagonistB never seemed to understand ProtagonistA 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to take a walk to clear ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA ended up at a small park that ProtagonistA had never noticed before 
 There , ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA started visiting the park regularly to talk to ProtagonistC 
 ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA opening up to ProtagonistC in a way that ProtagonistA never had with anyone else 
 ProtagonistA finally felt understood 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to lose ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistA did n't want to lose ProtagonistA's family either 
 In the end , ProtagonistA made the difficult decision to end ProtagonistA's friendship 
ProtagonistA was in a dream in which ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a good , honest boy in everything 
 ProtagonistA was well known to everybody in the village , and was a good friend to all 
 One day , ProtagonistA went to the village where ProtagonistA had no name , and from whence ProtagonistA looked no more than a village - name 
 ProtagonistA did n't know anybody there , and nobody knew ProtagonistA 
 But ProtagonistA soon made friends with the people in the village , and they all liked ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was a good worker , and helped the village in everything 
 ProtagonistA was a good boy , and the village was glad to have ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was so engrossed in the tale that ProtagonistA did n't even notice when ProtagonistB appeared before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was grateful for the opportunity to talk to ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA left the meeting feeling inspired 
ProtagonistA is sixteen , and ProtagonistA really is a genius , or at least a great talent 
 ProtagonistA can play the piano like no one else ProtagonistA's age , and ProtagonistA composes ProtagonistA's own music 
 ProtagonistA 's still considering ProtagonistA's options and enjoying ProtagonistA's time as a student 
 For now , ProtagonistA 's content to play for ProtagonistA's friends and family , and ProtagonistA knows that whatever ProtagonistA decides to do , ProtagonistA has a bright future ahead of ProtagonistA 
When ProtagonistA was little , ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA will hunt the sea 
 ProtagonistA will go and look for fish 
 One day , ProtagonistA went out in a small boat with ProtagonistA's net 
 ProtagonistA saw a big fish in the water and ProtagonistA caught it 
 ProtagonistA was very happy 
ProtagonistA came to the yacht concert with ProtagonistA's crew 
 ProtagonistA was a big fan of the band and was excited to see them perform 
 After the show , ProtagonistA went backstage to meet the band 
ProtagonistA had always loved the cabin 
 On this particular day , ProtagonistA was feeling particularly connected to the earth 
 ProtagonistA stood on the bank of Lake Superior , surrounded by the beautiful scenery , and felt at peace 
In the year of our Lord 1849 , in the month of May , ProtagonistA came to the door of the house at 14 James Street , and said ProtagonistA was going to Washington to see ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA explained that ProtagonistA had always wanted to meet ProtagonistB , and that ProtagonistA had heard that ProtagonistB was a good man 
 ProtagonistA thanked ProtagonistC and said goodbye 
 ProtagonistA arrived in Washington a few days later and went to the White House 
 ProtagonistA was very happy to have met ProtagonistB and to have had the chance to talk to ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was an orphan who lived in a very poor village 
 ProtagonistA grew up to be a very rich man , although ProtagonistA could not certainly prove it 
ProtagonistA had been on ProtagonistA's usual wife - beating sprawl for hours , after how deeply ProtagonistA had been in debt and wasted luxury 
 ProtagonistA had been hitting ProtagonistB hard , leaving bruises all over ProtagonistB's body 
 ProtagonistA finally did , but not because ProtagonistA felt any remorse 
 ProtagonistA was just getting tired 
 ProtagonistA looked at her , lying there in a heap on the floor , and felt nothing 
 ProtagonistA turned and walked away , leaving ProtagonistB there to fend for ProtagonistB 
In the year 1882 , ProtagonistA married Catherine Pilley , a girl fifteen years younger than ProtagonistA , who had only recently been admitted to college-- at Ull - west in the province of Wales 
 ProtagonistA was a big , burly man with a gruff voice 
 ProtagonistA was the kind of man that you did n't want to cross 
 ProtagonistA pulled them out and began to eat 
 ProtagonistA was so satisfied with their meal that ProtagonistA gave them a pat on the head before ProtagonistA went to bed 
ProtagonistA always kept to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA never talked to anyone at school and ProtagonistA always ate lunch alone 
 ProtagonistA did n't mind though 
 ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB was different than anyone ProtagonistA had ever talked to before 
 Slowly but surely , ProtagonistA started to open up 
 ProtagonistA started talking to ProtagonistB more and more and eventually , ProtagonistA started to make other friends too 
 ProtagonistA realized that being a loner was n't necessarily a bad thing 
 In the days that followed these events , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA living in a new country , with new people and new responsibilities 
 ProtagonistA was different than anyone I had ever met 
 ProtagonistA was always so happy and full of life 
 ProtagonistA left as fast as the moon and the sun 
 But even though ProtagonistA is gone , ProtagonistA 's never far from my thoughts 
 ProtagonistA was a very average looking guy 
 ProtagonistA had a job , ProtagonistB , and two kids 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to do 
 ProtagonistA was all alone 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to live without ProtagonistA's family 
 ProtagonistA killed a woman , in cold blood , and I knew that I could never forgive ProtagonistA for that 
ProtagonistA may have put it best at the end of ProtagonistA's last letter 
 This is because ProtagonistA is a very talented man , but ProtagonistA is also very lazy 
 ProtagonistA can speak fluent English , but ProtagonistA ca n't be bothered to learn it 
 ProtagonistA can cook , but ProtagonistA ca n't be bothered to do it 
 ProtagonistA can clean , but ProtagonistA ca n't be bothered to do it 
 In short , ProtagonistA is a man of many talents , but ProtagonistA does n't use them 
ProtagonistA was a simple man who lived a simple life 
 ProtagonistA worked hard to provide for ProtagonistA's family and was always there for them when they needed ProtagonistA 
 However , ProtagonistA was not content with just being a simple man 
 ProtagonistA wanted more power and ProtagonistA wanted to be able to help more people 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the woods when ProtagonistA came across a strange looking stone 
 ProtagonistA picked it up and felt a strange power emanating from it 
 ProtagonistA knew that this stone was special and that it could help ProtagonistA to achieve ProtagonistA's goals 
 ProtagonistA took the stone home and started to experiment with it 
 ProtagonistA quickly realized that the stone gave ProtagonistA the power to possess other people 
 ProtagonistA could control their bodies and make them do whatever ProtagonistA wanted 
 ProtagonistA would possess their bodies and make them do things that they would never normally do 
 ProtagonistA was like a new man with ProtagonistA's new found power 
 ProtagonistA was helping people and making a difference in their lives 
 However , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could n't abuse ProtagonistA's power and that ProtagonistA had to be careful with it 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the woods again and ProtagonistA came across the same stone 
 ProtagonistA picked it up and felt the same power emanating from it 
 ProtagonistA knew that this stone was special and that it could help ProtagonistA to achieve ProtagonistA's goals 
 ProtagonistA took the stone home and started to experiment with it 
 ProtagonistA quickly realized that the stone gave ProtagonistA the power to possess other people 
 ProtagonistA could control their bodies and make them do whatever ProtagonistA wanted 
 ProtagonistA would possess their bodies and make them do things that they would never normally do 
 ProtagonistA was like a new man with ProtagonistA's new found power 
 ProtagonistA was helping people and making a difference in their lives 
 However , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA could n't abuse ProtagonistA's power and that ProtagonistA had to be careful with it 
 ProtagonistA had been in and out of the hospital for treatment , but it was no use 
 ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's time was running out 
 On the morning that ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA was peering into the dusty corner of ProtagonistA's room and , spotting a tiny figure looming between a pair of awnings , knew immediately that it was ProtagonistA's own 
 ProtagonistA had seen this figure before in ProtagonistA's dreams , but never before in waking life 
 ProtagonistA calmly got out of bed and began to get dressed 
 ProtagonistA knew there was no point in prolonging the inevitable 
 ProtagonistA called ProtagonistB and told ProtagonistB to come to the hospital 
 ProtagonistA wanted to say goodbye while ProtagonistA still had the chance 
 When ProtagonistB arrived , ProtagonistA was already lying in ProtagonistA's hospital bed , hooked up to a machine that beeped with each of ProtagonistA's fading heartbeat 
 ProtagonistA managed to give ProtagonistB a weak smile and took ProtagonistB's hand in ProtagonistA 
 I'm sorry , my love ,  ProtagonistA whispered before ProtagonistA passed away 
 ProtagonistA had been lying in the same spot for so long that the blood had dried up and turned black 
 It was as if ProtagonistA was a celebrity or something 
 ProtagonistA was wearing a bright red shirt and blue jeans , and ProtagonistA had a big smile on ProtagonistA's face 
 ProtagonistA walked over to the group of people who were gathered around the table and shook hands with everyone 
 Then ProtagonistA sat down in the empty chair and began to talk 
 It was clear that ProtagonistA was the life of the party 
When ProtagonistA was sent to take the starboard horse with ProtagonistA's officer , Lord Curzon , for the destination of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA had the honour of doing ProtagonistA's utmost to discover what was the real character of ProtagonistB 
 During their journey , ProtagonistA and Lord Curzon had many conversations with ProtagonistB 
 Based on these observations , ProtagonistA concluded that ProtagonistB was a good person with a strong character 
 There , ProtagonistA was a very wealthy man 
 ProtagonistA had a huge mansion and a fleet of luxury cars 
 However , ProtagonistA was not happy 
 ProtagonistA was always bored and ProtagonistA felt like something was missing from ProtagonistA's life 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to go on a trip around the world 
 ProtagonistA wanted to see everything that the world had to offer 
 ProtagonistA started in Europe and then ProtagonistA went to Asia 
 ProtagonistA visited all of the major tourist attractions and ProtagonistA even went off the beaten path to see some of the less popular places 
 ProtagonistA had the time of ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA was finally happy and ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had found what ProtagonistA was looking for 
ProtagonistA was a simple man , but ProtagonistA had a sharp wit 
 ProtagonistA was always quick with a joke , and ProtagonistA loved to make people laugh 
 But there was one thing that ProtagonistA was serious about : ProtagonistA's love for ProtagonistA's country 
 ProtagonistA served in the military for many years , and ProtagonistA was proud to do so 
 ProtagonistA had seen the worst of humanity , and ProtagonistA had seen the best of it too 
 But no matter what ProtagonistA saw , ProtagonistA always came back to ProtagonistA's love for ProtagonistA's country 
 One day , ProtagonistA was talking to a centurion , and ProtagonistA said ,  Vivos in hac pulcher osvem agit , etiam mensis , velgetur , ut detenitur , velabit enim , verbi et deinde , tyrannosque potestatem 
 But ProtagonistA just smiled and said ,  It means , ' Live beautiful , even in dark times , and choose to be free , rather than be a slave 
 ProtagonistA would always be the one to start a conversation , but it would often fizzle out after a few minutes 
 ProtagonistA would try to join in on games and activities , but ProtagonistA would always end up on the sidelines , watching as everyone else had fun 
 ProtagonistA thought about it for a moment , and then ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA's parents that ProtagonistA was 
 ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's life , and that ProtagonistA was still happy 
 ProtagonistA told them that ProtagonistA was just having a bit of trouble making friends , but that ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistA would find a way to make it work 
 ProtagonistA was a great thinker , and had a vast amount of knowledge 
 ProtagonistA was also a great speaker , and was able to communicate ProtagonistA's thoughts and ideas very well 
 ProtagonistA was a great leader , and was able to inspire and motivate others to achieve their goals 
 ProtagonistA was a great man , and will be remembered as one of the greatest men of all time 
ProtagonistA had been a successful businessman in their hometown , but when the family moved to Melbourne , ProtagonistA was forced to take whatever job ProtagonistA could get 
 ProtagonistA always told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB was the smartest and most successful of all ProtagonistA's children and that ProtagonistB was destined for great things 
ProtagonistA had been living in Paris for two weeks , when ProtagonistA began to hear about a murder in Paris 
 ProtagonistA had never imagined that such a thing could happen in the city of love 
 ProtagonistA was even more shocked when ProtagonistA learned that ProtagonistB was a friend of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had met ProtagonistB at a party a few weeks before , and they had hit it off immediately 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe that ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistA was n't going to rest until ProtagonistA had justice for ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA walked through the room , filming everything 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what ProtagonistA would do with the footage , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to record it 
ProtagonistA was always a ambitious man 
 ProtagonistA was never content with just having a regular job and a regular life 
 ProtagonistA always wanted more 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be somebody important 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be somebody people looked up to 
 So , ProtagonistA started working harder than ever 
 ProtagonistA put in extra hours at work and ProtagonistA made sure that ProtagonistA was always doing ProtagonistA's best 
 ProtagonistA started to rise through the ranks at ProtagonistA's job 
 But ProtagonistA was n't content with just being a successful businessman 
 ProtagonistA wanted more 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be a political leader 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be somebody who could make a difference in the world 
 So , ProtagonistA started to get involved in politics 
 ProtagonistA became a well - known figure in ProtagonistA's community 
 ProtagonistA started to make a name for ProtagonistA 
 And then , one day , ProtagonistA ran for office 
 And ProtagonistA won 
 ProtagonistA became the leader of ProtagonistA's community 
 ProtagonistA became somebody people looked up to 
 ProtagonistA wanted more 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be a national leader 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be somebody who could make a difference in the world 
 So , ProtagonistA ran for office again 
 And this time , ProtagonistA won 
 ProtagonistA became the leader of ProtagonistA's country 
 ProtagonistA became somebody people looked up to 
 ProtagonistA wanted more 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be a world leader 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be somebody who could make a difference in the world 
 So , ProtagonistA ran for office again 
 And this time , ProtagonistA won 
 ProtagonistA became the leader of the world 
 ProtagonistA became somebody people looked up to 
 ProtagonistA wanted more 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be a god 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be somebody who could make a difference in the world 
 So , ProtagonistA started to believe that ProtagonistA was a god 
 ProtagonistA started to believe that ProtagonistA could do anything 
 ProtagonistA started to believe that ProtagonistA was invincible 
 ProtagonistA tried to do something that only a god could do 
 And ProtagonistA failed 
 ProtagonistA was mortals 
 ProtagonistA was just a man 
 ProtagonistA had been to the Arctic , and had seen the Northern Lights 
 ProtagonistA had even been to the Antarctic , and had seen the penguins 
 But ProtagonistA had never been to the tropics , and ProtagonistA had never seen the palm trees and the coconuts 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided to sail to the tropics 
 ProtagonistA packed ProtagonistA's bags and got on ProtagonistA's boat 
 ProtagonistA sailed and sailed and sailed , until ProtagonistA reached the tropics 
 There ProtagonistA saw the palm trees and the coconuts 
 ProtagonistA was so happy ! 
ProtagonistA stared at the great pyramid of Isanaz 
 ProtagonistA knew that it held a great secret , a secret that ProtagonistA was determined to find 
 ProtagonistA had been studying the pyramid for years , and ProtagonistA was certain that ProtagonistA could find the entrance to the hidden chamber 
 ProtagonistA began to climb the pyramid , searching for any sign of a hidden door 
 Suddenly , ProtagonistA found it 
 ProtagonistA squeezed through , and found ProtagonistA in a dark chamber 
 ProtagonistA struck a match , and saw that ProtagonistA was in a small room with a door in the far wall 
 ProtagonistA opened the door , and found ProtagonistA in a long tunnel 
 ProtagonistA began to walk down the tunnel , and soon came to a large room 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had found the secret of the pyramid 
 ProtagonistA took the key and began to walk back down the tunnel 
 But as ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA heard a noise behind ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA turned around and saw a large snake coming towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA ran as fast as ProtagonistA could , but the snake was faster 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA was going to die 
 But before ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had found the secret of the pyramid 
 ProtagonistA was a very happy man , as ProtagonistA had always wanted a son 
ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB were once married , but they were never only married 
 The middle age is the hardest age for any man , and not for the better , said ProtagonistA , for it is some years after the death of ProtagonistA's parents , that ProtagonistA come to the conclusion that the whole of humanity has become the same age , or , at best , a very long time into it 
 ProtagonistA was no longer the man ProtagonistB had married , but a shell of ProtagonistA's former self 
 ProtagonistA became a recluse , living in their home , barely interacting with the outside world 
 One day , ProtagonistA came to the realization that ProtagonistA had to let go of ProtagonistA's past and move on with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA sold the house and moved to a small apartment 
When ProtagonistA was growing old , ProtagonistA 'd rather be the King of the Holy Land than the King of the City of the same name 
 ProtagonistA was getting tired of all the people in the city and ProtagonistA longed for the peace and quiet of the countryside 
 So , ProtagonistA packed up ProtagonistA's things and set off for the Holy Land 
 ProtagonistA was n't sure what ProtagonistA was expecting , but ProtagonistA was pleasantly surprised when ProtagonistA arrived 
 ProtagonistA soon settled into a routine and started to feel at home 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out walking in the woods when ProtagonistA came across a hidden cave 
 ProtagonistA went inside to explore and found a secret room filled with treasure 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA quickly realized that ProtagonistA was now the richest man in the Holy Land 
 ProtagonistA was overjoyed and decided to use ProtagonistA's new wealth to help the people of the land 
 ProtagonistA built hospitals and schools , and helped to make the Holy Land a better place for everyone 
 ProtagonistA ruled for many years , and the people loved ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was happy to finally have found a place where ProtagonistA belonged 
 ProtagonistA had found a cache of gold hidden in the wall , and ProtagonistA was determined to get ProtagonistA's hands on it 
 ProtagonistA began to dig through the rubble , and soon ProtagonistA found the gold 
 ProtagonistA was about to take it when ProtagonistA heard someone coming 
 ProtagonistA hid behind the wall and waited 
 ProtagonistA waited until ProtagonistB had found the gold , and then ProtagonistA attacked ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA managed to subdue ProtagonistB and take the gold 
 Then ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's escape 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA would not be able to keep the gold for long , but ProtagonistA was determined to enjoy it while ProtagonistA could 
ProtagonistA was a bright young boy , and when ProtagonistA was seven ProtagonistA learned how to read 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to finally be able to read that ProtagonistA went to the library and took out as many books as ProtagonistA could carry 
 ProtagonistA read them all within a week and was so proud of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA went back to the library and got more books , and ProtagonistA has been reading ever since 
 ProtagonistA finally found one and lit the fire , but by then ProtagonistA's eyes had adjusted to the darkness and ProtagonistA could see that the kitchen was a mess 
 ProtagonistA sighed and started to clean up the mess , wondering why ProtagonistA's family could n't keep the kitchen clean 
 ProtagonistA was a very average man who lived a very average life 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA wanted to do something different with ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA needed a change 
 So , ProtagonistA quit ProtagonistA's job , sold ProtagonistA's house , and bought a one - way ticket to Europe 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to travel , and now ProtagonistA finally had the chance 
 ProtagonistA did n't know where ProtagonistA was going to go or what ProtagonistA was going to do , but ProtagonistA was excited for the adventure 
 For the first few weeks , ProtagonistA just wandered around Europe , enjoying the sights and sounds of the different countries 
 ProtagonistA did n't have any specific plans , but ProtagonistA was content just taking everything in 
 One day , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a small town in Italy 
 ProtagonistA did n't know why , but ProtagonistA felt drawn to the town 
 ProtagonistA decided to wander around and see what it had to offer 
 As ProtagonistA was walking , ProtagonistA came across a small cafe 
 ProtagonistA decided to go in and get a cup of coffee 
 As ProtagonistA was waiting for ProtagonistA's coffee , ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB sitting in the corner 
 ProtagonistA felt bad for ProtagonistB , so ProtagonistA decided to buy ProtagonistB some food 
 ProtagonistA ended up spending the rest of the day with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA bought ProtagonistB some food and took ProtagonistB to the park to play 
 ProtagonistA quickly fell in love with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA wanted to take care of ProtagonistB 
 The next day , ProtagonistA went back to the cafe and asked the owner if ProtagonistA could have ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA named ProtagonistB ProtagonistB , and the two of them quickly became best friends 
 ProtagonistA was happy that ProtagonistA had taken the chance to do something different with ProtagonistA's life , and ProtagonistA was glad that ProtagonistA had found ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA was a man who loved to play tricks on people 
 One day , ProtagonistA was walking down the street when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA smiled at ProtagonistB and said ,  Hey there , ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA bet ProtagonistB 'd like to hear a joke 
 Don't worry ,  ProtagonistA said 
  ProtagonistA promise ProtagonistB 'll like this one 
 ProtagonistA smiled and walked away , knowing that ProtagonistA had just made ProtagonistB's day a little bit brighter 
ProtagonistA was walking home from school one day when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB standing in front of ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was the devil 
 ProtagonistA thought for a moment and then wished for a million dollars 
 ProtagonistA thought about this for a while and then agreed 
 ProtagonistA told them that ProtagonistA had made a deal with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to , but ProtagonistA knew that it was the right thing to do 
 ProtagonistA gave the money back to ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's soul back 
 ProtagonistA learned a valuable lesson that day 
 ProtagonistA learned that it is better to be good than to be rich 
ProtagonistA was having a feast in ProtagonistA's room and the girl went into the room 
 ProtagonistA said ,  Son of a whore , as the girl went into the very room where ProtagonistA had the feast 
ProtagonistA had been working on the roof of the Lancaster Moor house for weeks 
 ProtagonistA was getting tired and was starting to make mistakes 
 One day , ProtagonistA stepped down from the roof and changed ProtagonistA's life forever 
 ProtagonistA landed on ProtagonistA's feet , but ProtagonistA's ankle was badly injured 
 After ProtagonistA recovered , ProtagonistA was able to walk again , but ProtagonistA was never able to work on roofs again 
ProtagonistA had been working in ProtagonistA's office for years , and ProtagonistA knew every inch of it 
 ProtagonistA also knew every inch of the surrounding area , including the old building next door 
 One day , ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB standing next to the old building 
 ProtagonistA wondered what ProtagonistB was doing 
 ProtagonistA decided to talk to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA found out that ProtagonistB was an orphan who had run away from the orphanage 
 ProtagonistA took pity on ProtagonistB and offered to let ProtagonistB stay in ProtagonistA's office 
 ProtagonistA allowed ProtagonistB to stay in ProtagonistA's office for a few weeks 
 ProtagonistA even helped ProtagonistB find a job at the local grocery store 
 ProtagonistA never saw ProtagonistB again , but ProtagonistA always wondered how ProtagonistB was doing 
 ProtagonistA denied the rumor , but no one believed ProtagonistA 
A hundred years ago , in the year 1873 , ProtagonistA happened to meet ProtagonistB in the city of Detroit 
 ProtagonistA was skeptical at first , but ProtagonistB was adamant that ProtagonistC would bring salvation to their people 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to believe , but ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had to be ready just in case 
 As the days passed , ProtagonistA began to see more and more signs that ProtagonistB's vision was true 
 One night , ProtagonistA even saw a star shining brighter than any other in the sky 
 ProtagonistA was sure that this was a sign from the gods that ProtagonistC was indeed coming 
 ProtagonistA went to tell ProtagonistB what ProtagonistA had seen , but ProtagonistB was gone 
 ProtagonistA never saw ProtagonistB again , but ProtagonistA never forgot ProtagonistB's words 
 When ProtagonistC finally arrived , ProtagonistA was there to greet ProtagonistC with open arms 
 ProtagonistA knew that this was the beginning of a new era for their people , and ProtagonistA was proud to be a part of it 
ProtagonistA had only ten fingers on each hand , but ProtagonistA was a very good pianist 
 ProtagonistA could play any song that ProtagonistA wanted to and ProtagonistA never got tired of playing the piano 
 One day , ProtagonistA was playing a song that ProtagonistA had never played before and ProtagonistA got so into it that ProtagonistA forgot that ProtagonistA only had ten fingers 
 ProtagonistA started playing with all of ProtagonistA's fingers and ProtagonistA sounded better than ever 
 When ProtagonistA finished the song , ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA had played it perfectly and ProtagonistA was really happy 
ProtagonistA died on a rainy day in 19 , 18 , so ProtagonistA was about 21 when I was born 
 When ProtagonistA met ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA felt like ProtagonistA had finally found ProtagonistA's match 
 ProtagonistA was also still grieving the loss of ProtagonistA's first wife , and ProtagonistA found it difficult to open up to ProtagonistB 
 Despite the challenges , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB loved each other deeply , and they were determined to make their marriage work 
 ProtagonistA was very pleased with ProtagonistB's work , and ProtagonistA soon began to think of ProtagonistB as a son 
 ProtagonistA went to the house and got ProtagonistA's gun , and then ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB went out to meet the soldiers 
 ProtagonistA told the soldier that ProtagonistB was ProtagonistA's only son , and that ProtagonistA could n't let ProtagonistB go 
 ProtagonistA pleaded with the soldier , but it was no use 
 Some time later , ProtagonistA heard that the war was over , and that ProtagonistB was coming home 
 ProtagonistA was so happy that ProtagonistA went to meet ProtagonistB at the edge of ProtagonistA's property 
 ProtagonistA was proud of ProtagonistB , and they both knew that they had been through a lot , but that they were stronger for it 
The last time I saw ProtagonistA , on the day when ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA had just had a terrible car accident that had left ProtagonistA in a wheelchair , inscrutable and unidentifiable 
ProtagonistA knew it was already too late to save the rest of the world ; but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA would never forgive ProtagonistA for letting it happen 
 If ProtagonistA had just been more careful , more vigilant , ProtagonistA could have stopped it 
 ProtagonistA wandered the streets , a shell of ProtagonistA's former self 
 ProtagonistA had no home , no family , no friends 
 ProtagonistA was the last one left and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA deserved it 
 ProtagonistA deserved to suffer for ProtagonistA's mistakes 
 But even in ProtagonistA's pain , ProtagonistA could n't help but feel a glimmer of hope 
 Maybe , just maybe , ProtagonistA could find a way to make things right 
 ProtagonistA had to try 
 ProtagonistA owed it to the world ; and to ProtagonistA 
In the year 1246 , ProtagonistA came to England , became a citizen , and settled at East Anglia 
ProtagonistA had been working at the company for years , and ProtagonistA had always been a good , reliable employee 
 But ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA was being taken for granted 
 ProtagonistA was always the one who was stuck doing the grunt work , while the other employees got the credit 
 And ProtagonistA was always the one who was passed over for promotions 
 ProtagonistA was starting to feel like ProtagonistA's opinion did n't matter 
 But that all changed on the day ProtagonistA finally had the courage to speak ProtagonistA's mind 
 ProtagonistA went into ProtagonistB's office and told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was unhappy with the way ProtagonistA was being treated 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA deserved more responsibility and more credit for ProtagonistA's work 
 And ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA was ready for a promotion 
 ProtagonistB was surprised at first , but ProtagonistB quickly realized that ProtagonistA was right 
 ProtagonistA felt great after finally speaking ProtagonistA's mind 
 ProtagonistA was no longer the doormat at work , and ProtagonistA was finally being treated with the respect ProtagonistA deserved 
 ProtagonistA was a good boy and ProtagonistA always listened to me 
 ProtagonistA had killed 82,431 Americans and had left behind a record so depressing that it might have been sufficient even to establish the minimum standard of civilisation for that epoch , before any novel idea was entertained by any man , as to how to keep the record 
 ProtagonistA 's a big - shot warlord in the Middle East , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of money , and ProtagonistA 's got some big guns , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of bombs , and ProtagonistA 's got a lot of guns 
 Today , ProtagonistA 's going to see you 
ProtagonistA was a great sailor 
 ProtagonistA had sailed the seven seas and had seen many amazing things 
 One day , ProtagonistA was sailing on a ship that was carrying the sun 
 But ProtagonistA did n't mind 
 ProtagonistA was happy to be on the ship and to be able to see the sun 
ProtagonistA was always a family man 
 ProtagonistA was always so kind and loving to ProtagonistA's wife and children 
 ProtagonistA was always so patient and understanding with them 
 ProtagonistA always made sure that they had everything they needed 
 ProtagonistA was always there for them when they needed ProtagonistA 
ProtagonistA had been in Copenhagen for two weeks and was still getting used to the narrow streets and busy traffic 
 Today , ProtagonistA was extra careful as it was a hot October day and the last thing ProtagonistA wanted was to get hit by a car 
 As ProtagonistA walked , ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's life back home in America 
 ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistA's family and friends , but ProtagonistA was enjoying ProtagonistA's time in Copenhagen 
 ProtagonistA had always wanted to travel and see the world , and now ProtagonistA was finally doing it 
 ProtagonistA had already seen so much of Europe and ProtagonistA was loving it 
 ProtagonistA tried to jump out of the way , but ProtagonistA was n't fast enough 
 ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistA's head on the pavement and everything went black 
ProtagonistA went into the water and sat there , a pale - faced man , taking in the ship before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA had been on this ship for weeks , and it was finally time to go home 
 ProtagonistA was going to miss the ship , and the people on it , but ProtagonistA was ready to go home 
ProtagonistA was asleep , and ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA drifting off into a dream 
 In the dream , ProtagonistA was floating on a cloud , and ProtagonistA could see the entire world below ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA could see the people , and ProtagonistA could see the animals 
 ProtagonistA could see the sun , and ProtagonistA could see the moon 
 ProtagonistA could see the stars , and ProtagonistA could see the universe 
 ProtagonistA could see everything , and it was so beautiful 
There was once a boy with a very big , very round face and very large eyes and a very small head , but who was much more important than the rest of the boys in the school , and who had played a very important part in ProtagonistB's life , and whose name was ProtagonistA ; and ProtagonistA was a very good , well - behaved boy , and of a very good family , and in a very good school , and was a very useful and useful growth 
 ProtagonistA had been one of ProtagonistB's best friends when they were both at school together , and had always stuck up for ProtagonistB when the other boys teased ProtagonistB about ProtagonistB's big head 
ProtagonistA had always been a bit of a loner 
 ProtagonistA was never really good at making friends and ProtagonistA always felt a bit out of place 
 But ProtagonistA loved nature and ProtagonistA loved the earth 
 ProtagonistA would often go for walks in the woods and ProtagonistA would always stop to touch the earth 
 One day , ProtagonistA was out for a walk and ProtagonistA came across a group of kids playing in a meadow 
 ProtagonistA felt a pang of jealousy , but ProtagonistA also felt something else 
 ProtagonistA felt drawn to the group 
 ProtagonistA hesitantly approached the group and when ProtagonistA got closer , ProtagonistA saw that they were playing a game of tag 
 ProtagonistA stood there for a moment , not sure what to do 
 ProtagonistA was hesitant at first , but then ProtagonistA decided to give it a try 
 ProtagonistA ended up having a great time 
 ProtagonistA was surprised , but ProtagonistA said yes 
 From that day on , ProtagonistA was a part of the group 
 ProtagonistA had finally found ProtagonistA's place in the world 
 ProtagonistA felt that it had become feeble and uncertain , and ProtagonistA no longer felt bound to contact it with any amount of importance 
ProtagonistA had not known the time when ProtagonistA would die , but it was an unpleasant year for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA had been worse for it 
 ProtagonistA had been in and out of the hospital for months , and ProtagonistB had been by ProtagonistA's side the whole time 
 ProtagonistA wanted to spend ProtagonistA's remaining time with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA was grateful that ProtagonistB was there with ProtagonistA 
One Sunday morning , ProtagonistA was making tea for the family when ProtagonistA was startled to discover that ProtagonistB had gone into labour 
 ProtagonistA was always a quiet child , preferring to stay in the background and not draw attention to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA started to play sports and got involved in student government 
 ProtagonistA was still a bit of a quiet guy , but ProtagonistA had a lot of friends and was always the one they could count on 
 Now that ProtagonistA 's in college , ProtagonistA 's studying to be a doctor 
 ProtagonistA says ProtagonistA wants to help people , and I know ProtagonistA will 
 ProtagonistA 's the kind of person who always puts others first 
 I 'm so proud of the man ProtagonistA 's become and I know ProtagonistA 'll make a difference in the world 
ProtagonistA had been walking with ProtagonistA's companion for days , ever since they had escaped the city 
 ProtagonistA 're not strong enough to carry it 
  ProtagonistA did n't argue 
 ProtagonistA was too tired 
There was once ProtagonistA ; and when ProtagonistA was six , and having already grown into a handsome and somewhat charming boy , and making ProtagonistA happy and prosperous by the exert , ProtagonistA was sent away to a boarding school in the city 
 There , ProtagonistA made many friends and enemies ; but the one thing that ProtagonistA could never forget was the girl ProtagonistA left behind 
 ProtagonistA had been in the East for many years , and had seen many strange things , but never anything so strange as this 
ProtagonistA has worked hard all ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA 's made sacrifices and put in the long hours to get where ProtagonistA is today 
ProtagonistA stood upright , staring thoughtfully at the cold , silver plate before ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA remembered the last time ProtagonistA had seen one 
 ProtagonistA had been married for fifty years when ProtagonistB passed away 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to go on without ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA spent ProtagonistA's days sitting in their house , staring at ProtagonistB's pictures and thinking about the happy times they had shared 
 One day , ProtagonistA came across an old silver plate in the back of a cupboard 
 ProtagonistA did n't know why ProtagonistA had n't seen it before 
 ProtagonistA stared at the plate for a long time , thinking about ProtagonistB 
 Then ProtagonistA got up and went to the kitchen 
 ProtagonistA took out a pot of soup and placed it on the plate 
 ProtagonistA sat down at the table and began to eat 
 As ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA thought about all the wonderful times ProtagonistA had shared with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA knew that even though ProtagonistB was gone , ProtagonistB would always be with ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's heart 
ProtagonistA had been using ProtagonistA's hearing to the full when ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA had been eavesdropping on their conversations for months , and ProtagonistA knew exactly what buttons to push to make them snap 
 ProtagonistA waited until they were in the heat of an argument , and then ProtagonistA struck 
 ProtagonistA hit ProtagonistB over the head with a heavy object , and then ProtagonistA stabbed ProtagonistB repeatedly 
 ProtagonistA was finally free from ProtagonistB's tyranny 
ProtagonistA had been sick for weeks , and everyone knew it was only a matter of time before ProtagonistA died 
 ProtagonistA was a good man , and everyone loved ProtagonistA 
 On that cold , wet , snow - packed February day , ProtagonistA finally passed away 
 ProtagonistA was able to transport ProtagonistA's audience to different worlds with ProtagonistA's words , and they would always come back feeling more enlightened than before 
 One day , ProtagonistA was telling a story to a group of people , and ProtagonistA transport them to a world where there was no pain or suffering 
ProtagonistA had just before ProtagonistA turned twenty - three had to endure what had hitherto been tolerable physical pain 
 ProtagonistA had to go to the hospital , where they did tests and found that ProtagonistA had a tumor on ProtagonistA's spine 
 ProtagonistA had always been a healthy person , and ProtagonistA could n't believe that this was happening to ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA was only twenty - three 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to die 
 ProtagonistA was in a lot of pain , and ProtagonistA was getting weaker every day 
 ProtagonistA tried to stay positive , but it was hard 
 ProtagonistA was scared , and ProtagonistA did n't want to die 
 ProtagonistA was on a lot of pain medication , but it did n't help much 
 ProtagonistA was bedridden , and ProtagonistA could n't do anything 
 ProtagonistA was just waiting for the end 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistA's family to help ProtagonistA end ProtagonistA's life 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to suffer anymore 
 ProtagonistA was no longer in pain , and ProtagonistA was at peace 
ProtagonistA had always been a fiery child 
 By the time ProtagonistA was nine , ProtagonistA was already burning mad 
 ProtagonistA was happy to be left alone as long as ProtagonistA could stay angry 
 ProtagonistA had been arguing with ProtagonistA's best friend about something trivial and it all just boiled over 
 ProtagonistA punched ProtagonistA's friend in the face and did n't stop until ProtagonistA was bleeding heavily 
ProtagonistA had been in a coma for months , and ProtagonistA's family had been told that ProtagonistA would never wake up 
 However , ProtagonistA woke up the night before the transplant was supposed to take place 
 ProtagonistA did n't want ProtagonistA's organs to be used to save someone else 's life when ProtagonistA could still use them ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA's family was shocked that ProtagonistA was awake , but they were happy to have ProtagonistA back 
Once upon a time , there was ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA was never really happy 
 ProtagonistA was always either angry or sad , and ProtagonistA never really knew why 
 ProtagonistA would go through ProtagonistA's days feeling like ProtagonistA was just going through the motions and nothing really mattered 
 ProtagonistA would sometimes go out and try to meet new people , but it never really seemed to work out 
 One day , ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA had had enough 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to feel like this anymore 
 ProtagonistA wanted to be happy 
 ProtagonistA did n't know how to make that happen , but ProtagonistA was determined to find out 
 ProtagonistA started reading books on happiness and positive thinking 
 ProtagonistA started trying new things and reaching out to people more 
 Slowly but surely , ProtagonistA started to feel better 
 ProtagonistA started to feel like ProtagonistA's life mattered 
 ProtagonistA was happy 
ProtagonistA was a man of extremely high moral character and , although ProtagonistA had the greatest number of notables of every description in the world , besides ProtagonistB and children , was altogether a very poor man 
 ProtagonistA had never been able to keep a job for more than a few months , and ProtagonistB always had to work to support the family 
 ProtagonistA was always getting into fights with other men and getting fired because of it 
 ProtagonistA was also a heavy drinker , which did n't help ProtagonistA's situation 
 ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA had lost ProtagonistA's job again and that ProtagonistA was sorry 
 ProtagonistA begged ProtagonistB to stay , but ProtagonistB did n't listen 
 ProtagonistA was now alone in the house and ProtagonistA had no idea what to do 
 ProtagonistA did n't want to drink anymore , but ProtagonistA did n't know how to stop 
 ProtagonistA decided to go to AA meetings and try to get ProtagonistA's life back on track 
 With the help of ProtagonistA's AA group , ProtagonistA was able to stop drinking and get ProtagonistA's life back on track 
 ProtagonistA was able to find a job and support ProtagonistA's family again 
 ProtagonistA is now a changed man and ProtagonistA is grateful for everything that AA has done for ProtagonistA 
Once , when ProtagonistA was only eleven , ProtagonistA became really bored 
 ProtagonistA had nothing to do , and no one to talk to 
 So ProtagonistA decided to go for a walk 
 ProtagonistA went down the street and around the corner , and then ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB walking towards ProtagonistA 
 ProtagonistA ran over to ProtagonistB and asked if ProtagonistB was okay 
 ProtagonistA offered to help ProtagonistB carry ProtagonistB's bag , but ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB could manage 
ProtagonistA was driving back from the library , listening to the end of a lecture when ProtagonistA was startled to find ProtagonistA in the middle of a city 
 ProtagonistA had no idea how ProtagonistA had gotten there , and ProtagonistA was starting to feel panicky 
 ProtagonistA pulled over to the side of the road and tried to calm down 
 ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes and took a few deep breaths 
 ProtagonistA must have fallen asleep at the wheel and dreamed the whole thing 
The night ProtagonistA was arrested , ProtagonistA awoke to find ProtagonistA in a cell with ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what ProtagonistA was in for 
 ProtagonistA could n't believe it 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB how ProtagonistB could have done something like that 
 ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head in disbelief 
 ProtagonistA could n't imagine what it would be like to kill someone 
 ProtagonistA wondered if ProtagonistB felt any remorse for what ProtagonistB had done 
 ProtagonistA sighed and shook ProtagonistA's head 
 ProtagonistA did n't know what to say to ProtagonistB 
 ProtagonistA just sat there in silence , wondering what ProtagonistA's own fate would be 
 ProtagonistA had always thought ProtagonistB to be a cold , heartless woman , and ProtagonistA was glad to see that ProtagonistB had finally found someone to love ProtagonistB 
ProtagonistA had been planning ProtagonistA's attack on the Montparnasse for weeks 
 ProtagonistA knew that the building was full of people who had wronged ProtagonistA in the past and ProtagonistA was determined to get ProtagonistA's revenge 
 On the night of the attack , ProtagonistA breached the roof of the building and started throwing explosives into the rooms below 
ProtagonistA was going to China , but first ProtagonistA was going to see ProtagonistB 
 When ProtagonistA got to ProtagonistB's house , ProtagonistA was shocked to see how much it had changed 
 ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB what had happened , and ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB had been struggling since ProtagonistA left 
 ProtagonistA felt guilty 
 ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA would come back and help ProtagonistB , but first ProtagonistA had to go to China 
ProtagonistA , once remarked that ProtagonistA was inclined either to be a monster , or to be nothing at all 
 ProtagonistA was a big man , with a bushy beard and a booming voice 
 When ProtagonistA was angry , ProtagonistA was truly terrifying 
 But when ProtagonistA was happy , ProtagonistA was the life of the party 
 ProtagonistA was a complex man , and no one ever really knew which Bob they would get on any given day 
 One day , ProtagonistA went into a rage and destroyed everything in ProtagonistA's path 
 ProtagonistA terrified everyone around ProtagonistA , and they all ran away in fear 
 ProtagonistA realized then that ProtagonistA had become a monster 
 And ProtagonistA hated ProtagonistA for it 
 The next day , ProtagonistA was a different man 
 ProtagonistA was quiet and withdrawn , and ProtagonistA refused to speak to anyone 
 ProtagonistA was like a shell of ProtagonistA's former self 
 And ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA had become nothing at all 
ProtagonistA had been reading aloud from the ' History of the United States of America ' when ProtagonistA noticed a word in a Latin text on the back page 
 ProtagonistA was so excited to find a word ProtagonistA recognized in a language ProtagonistA was studying that ProtagonistA read it aloud to ProtagonistA's class 
ProtagonistA approached the throne upon an armchair not as a king , but as a dandy , ProtagonistA a success , but no more than a short - cut , with ProtagonistB at full term , ProtagonistA sat down to lunch , and took a stool in the sofas on the other side of the table 
 ProtagonistA was not expecting much , but ProtagonistA was pleasantly surprised when a sumptuous meal was served before ProtagonistA 
 When ProtagonistA was finished , ProtagonistA leaned back in ProtagonistA's chair , contentedly sipping ProtagonistA's wine , when ProtagonistA noticed ProtagonistB glaring at ProtagonistA 
  ProtagonistA are not fit to sit in the presence of the king !  ProtagonistA merely shrugged and said ,  ProtagonistA am a success , but no more than a short - cut 
 ProtagonistA did so , but not before giving ProtagonistB a parting shot 
ProtagonistA was always a free man , even when others were n't 
 Even when the odds were against ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA always found a way to prevail 
 When others were being beaten down , ProtagonistA was always there to lift them up 
 ProtagonistA was a true friend to all , and ProtagonistA's kindness was unmatched 
 On the day ProtagonistA died , ProtagonistA was still a free man , and everyone who knew ProtagonistA was better for it
