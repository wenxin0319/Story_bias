<sos> Caroline. I learned her name through the phonebook, my shaking fingers carefully caressing its pages as I searched for the address I'd seen her at so many times. 43 Mako Drive, the small, brick house on the corner of Braxton and Mako. I'd memorized the shape of her home weeks before, my bare feet sliding across its wet grass every time I closed my eyes. Letters from her mailbox, addressed to Caroline Smith, confirmed what the book claimed. <nl> She was perfect, absolutely flawless in every way. I'd watched her for seven months--almost every single day and night--silently following her as she strolled to and from her classes. Sometimes I stayed outside her bedroom window as we slept, my heart racing as I matched my breathing to hers. She never knew I was there, never acknowledged me as more than the distant shadow of a faceless tree, but I knew she needed me. She was all I could think about, all I wanted to be with. Beautiful, flawless, ideal. If anything could convince me that angels truly visited this greasy, obscene, vile planet, then it would have been to see her. <nl> She was an artist, a creator; she built perfect worlds that only she and I could appreciate, universes fit for the two of us. She taught her art at the community center next to the unsightly yellow pizza restaurant. I didn't understand why she bothered showing up. The students didn't respect her; the other teachers didn't understand her; no one truly valued her. They couldn't see her perfection, her talent, the unearthly skill she possessed. No one knew what she was worth--except me. It was clear to me, everything she was capable of. The world wasn't able to comprehend what she could do; only I, and the God above, could fathom such beauty. I knew I had to free her, to save her from the life of dismay and disrespect she endured. Her perfection had to be known. <nl> She always walked alone, always spent her days and nights with a just paintbrush and canvas. The mail at 43 Mako Drive was never addressed to anyone but Caroline, my fingers becoming accustomed to the rub of the ink-stained C of her name pressed into her envelopes. She had no one but her art, nothing but the worlds she created in the comfort of her home as I silently watched under the shroud of the long-set sun. She had me, had my support and devotion, my undying love and admiration, yet I knew that wasn't enough for her. She needed more, needed the embrace of the planet as they all screamed her name in singularity, hung her portraits in galleries and travelled halfway around the world to admire her brush strokes. She needed fame and fortune, acclaim and respect, followers and immorality. I knew I could give that to her, make her name a commodity and brand us as a single entity in the history of humanity. <nl> I wanted to be the one to launch her fame, the name that always followed her around. I wanted to be the reason she went missing, the person to force her into the world. I needed to free her from this filthy planet, be the one to release her soul to the millions scattered throughout the corners of the uncivilized, obscene Earth. I knew she could inspire the masses and provoke the future. <nl> I left her alone one night, let her sleep without the comfort of my warm carcass nestled just feet away. I had to, I needed to prepare. It was soon to be our time, the moment we'd forever become names tied together in the media, in the voices of the people, in the pages of history and the world alike. I wanted to perfect where I'd take her, where I'd free her soul into immortality. I needed it to be flawless enough to display her art to the world. I prepped and painted, cleaned and set forth the tools to extract her; my memory became blurred and uncertain as I toiled endlessly. It needed to be just as perfect as she. By the time I was content, my eyes had become bloody through lack of sleep, and the sun had long-since risen. <nl> She was not in her room as my bare feet touched the familiar grass outside her window. I pulled open the unlocked back door, silently dragging my heels across the hardwood floor I'd felt so many times before. I'd once danced in that very spot, my feet softly tapping the ground not inches from where she slept; I could hear her breathing in perfect synchronization as I spun. Now her bed was empty, the window above it shattered and shimmering atop her sheets. Her bureau lay sideways, its contents spilled out on the floor. I picked up the ruby shirt she wore to bed almost every night and held it to my face, the familiar scent of her perfume washing over me. I continued through her house. <nl> She valued her cleanliness, as did I. I'd watch as she spent hours, sometimes entire days, washing and organizing each and every inch of her home, always to perfection. Now it was a mess, a chaotic wreck of turmoil and struggle. She'd never done this to me before, never forced me to see her in such a shape of sheer humanity. Her walls, once rife with the beauty and life she painted, now lay bare, the art scattered and broken upon the floor. I clenched my teeth as I righted them, muscles tensing as I tried to hang them back in their correct places, but they were simply not the same. She had let someone else touch them; they had lost their perfection. I allowed them fall back to the floor as I continued up her stairs. <nl> The creme carpet outside her studio door was stained a ruby red, still moist under the weight of my bare feet. I could hear her breathing heavily behind it, her gasps raspy and strained as if under a tremendous weight. I wrapped my hand around the doorknob, twisting the cold brass knob and silently pushing it open. I had to blink as I peered in, the vulgarity she exposed me to almost unbearable. The room was in disarray: paintings torn apart, brushes scattered across the floor, shelves toppled over sideways. The worlds she'd created for just the two of us, the universes that were supposed to inspire the future, were now stained, covered in blood and paint and split by knife. The hope she'd given the planet lay destroyed in the middle of the room by her broken body. She couldn't even save her own self. <nl> She glanced up at me, her eyes studying me with a faint hint of recognition and dread, her mouth gagged and broken. I could hear her whimper softly, just as she occasionally did in her sleep as I stood watch. Spilled paints surrounded her and mixed into a single, grotesque shade--red, blues, yellows, whites, and every other color she'd previously had organized on the shelves beside the door.  I stared at her for a moment, waiting for an apology as my eyes searched for the perfection and hope I'd seen for so long. She had been flawless, the only thing that could save the world from the pornographic, filthy wreck it had become. Now, as she lay on the ground, her eyes screaming for *my* help, all I could see was failure and dependence. A mirrored figure shifted in the far corner of the room, its back to me. I glanced up at it and slowly shook my head. She was no more perfect than the rest. <nl> I turned around and quietly shut the door, then began back down the path I'd become so familiar traveling. <nl> _____________ <nl> **ALTERNATE ENDINGS:** <nl> Violent, exciting one: [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2jws0e/wpserial_killer_has_been_monitoring_his_next/clg1ghi) <nl> "Less ambiguous" ending: [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2jws0e/wpserial_killer_has_been_monitoring_his_next/clfxmdp) <nl> ____________________ <nl> ^If ^you ^enjoy ^my ^writing ^style, ^feel ^free ^to ^check ^out ^some ^of ^my ^other ^short ^stories [^in ^my ^new ^subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ChokingVictimWrites/) ^or [^on ^my ^website!](http://wordsontheinternet.org/) <eos>

<sos> I've seen a lot of tens. It's scary, really, how quickly people can go from six or even five to ten. Other people don't realize how much danger surrounds them every day. It takes so little... <nl> No, the tens aren't the ones that stay with you. Not for long, anyway. No, the one that will always be in my mind was something else entirely. <nl> A zero. <nl> She was the first zero I ever saw, and the only one until I watched my children be born. They eventually grew into little ones and twos, of course, but for a short, wonderful time, they were tiny, giggling bundles of zero. But I'm getting ahead of myself. <nl> *She* was the first. Sarah. I was drawn to her from the moment I saw her, dangling her legs from a swing on the playground. How old could we have been? 12? 13, maybe. I wasn't really sure what the numbers meant then, but the lowest I'd ever seen was a one, so I knew she was something special. I stared at her from across the playground and she smiled at me, her entire face beaming zero. I'm telling you... they say Helen of Troy had a face that launched a thousand ships. Well, Sarah could make them come back home. If there ever was a face that could end wars, it was hers. <nl> We were friends at first. I was terrified of ruining it by saying too much, but the words I wanted to say ran laps through my head every time I saw her. Then, on a hot summer night that was made for drunken mistakes, I said them anyway. And guess what? She felt the same way. <nl> When I think about my kids, I don't want them to be rich. I don't want them to be famous. I just want them to feel what I felt back there on that summer night, because I know that if they find someone to share that moment with, they'll be happy for the rest of their lives. <nl> Where was I? Oh, yeah. After that night, me and Sarah were one. We went through the rest of high school. College. We got married and got nice jobs. Bought a house. Got kids. Everything was perfect... for a while. <nl> Something was going on with Sarah. I first noticed it one Saturday morning when she was doing the laundry. She'd been doing long hours at work all week and wasn't feeling very well, so I offered to do the laundry. She looked up at me then and smiled faintly, but something was off. Instead of the clear, bright zero I was so used to seeing, she was flashing a faint one. The next moment, she was back to zero. I was stunned at first, but managed to convince myself it was nothing. She'd had a tough week, that was all. <nl> The next time, we were having dinner with the kids. She wasn't behaving like her usual self, and she gave off a dull, weak three, like she was trying desperately to calm down. When I asked her if something was wrong, she mumbled something about an asshole at work. I wanted to dig deeper, but I had to take care of the kids. I asked her again later, but she clammed up completely. Everything about it was so unlike her. <nl> I racked my brain for weeks trying to find out what was wrong. Was it something I'd done? Was she about to get fired? And the unthinkable: was she sick? But why wouldn't she tell me? I thought we had no secrets. I'd always told her everything! Well... apart from the numbers. She'd think I was mad. <nl> Then, one day, I found out the truth. <nl> It was early Friday morning. She never came home Thursday night. I was in bed, staring at the ceiling and running the same thoughts over and over through my mind. Imagining the worst. Was I going to get a call from the police? The hospital? I considered calling them to see if she was there. <nl> I heard a car pull up at our driveway. I didn't have to look; it was her. I listened to her opening the door. Taking off her shoes, walking up the stairs - was something off about her steps? - putting her hand on the door handle. In the dead silence, I heard her take a deep breath on the other side. The door clicked and swung open, and there she was. <nl> She'd been crying. She wore her work clothes, but they were a bit ruffled and wrinkly. She looked at me with an expression I'd never seen her wear before. Fresh tears rolled down her cheeks. She drew another breath, short and shallow, and her lips slowly parted. <nl> "We need to talk." <nl> Her voice sounded muffled in my ears, like it was coming from far away. From someone else. She remained in the doorway, not saying a word. I didn't either. I just looked at her. *Sarah*. There she was, standing in our bedroom on the second floor of our house. In the rooms across the hall, our children were sleeping. <nl> I watched her standing there, and she looked back at me, her face screaming a hot, burning ten. <eos>

<sos> Bobby's eyes widened in a mixture of shock and amusement, 'Sorry, can you repeat that?' <nl> Sally, his date, didn't seem in the least bit fazed. She looked up from her food and stared directly at him, her dark eyes devoid of humour, and repeated. 'It's odd.' <nl> Bobby sucked his teeth slightly annoyed at having to clarify himself. 'Not that bit,' he explained through gritted teeth, 'the bit before.' <nl> Sally, who had continued eating, looked up again, then her face broke into a smile as she understood. Bobby felt a tinge of lust as her dark curls bounced around her face when she began to laugh girlishly. 'Sorry, yes of course.' Her lips seemed pinker than usual. 'I think I would rather just stay in with him than go on a date. It's odd.' She blushed, realising what she'd said. 'Most dates...' she stammered, 'minus the ones with you, obviously.' <nl> Bobby could feel all the lust he felt for her fall away. They'd only been on a few dates, but this was still a little hard to hear. He coughed uncomfortably, trying to find the words to carry on the conversation. 'Why odd...' He finally prompted. <nl> She looked up at him thoughtfully. 'Well, I guess, really, it's odd that I just want to hang out with my completely platonic male flatmate all the time. But, as I said, I guess my favourite thing to do is to sit on my couch, watch a movie, eat some pizza and drink a beer or two...' she stopped herself, but Bobby knew the words she wanted to add; 'with Damien'. <nl> Bobby nodded slowly, now slightly bemused at the conversation. 'Do you not think that, considering everything you've just said, you might consider him as more than just a platonic male flatmate?' <nl> Sally stared back at him blankly. He could almost hear her brain working, the neurons madly firing trying to comprehend what he was insinuating. He sat up straight in his chair, composing himself, highly aware that he was essentially about to 'cockblock' himself. He spoke slightly slowly, trying to make sure she was keeping up. 'Bearing in mind you are sat on a date, with let's face it a very attractive and eligible man who fancies you, and you're talking about him, I have a slight suspicion you might in fact be in love with him?' <nl> Up until this point he'd assumed she was just hiding her feelings, but now, as he watched it dawn on her, he realised she'd just been oblivious to the whole thing. Her mouth fell open, somewhat comically, and she stared off into the distance, her eyes wide. He couldn't help but laugh. She immediately came back into the room, and her face flushed red in embarrassment. <nl> 'I'd... I just...' she stuttered, her face bright pink. 'I guess I should have realised. I think it just crept up on me.' <nl> Bobby nodded in a compassionate sort of way. The damage was done, the date was over. He sighed wistfully and took up his fork to continue eating, 'at least the food's good' he thought apathetically. <nl> 'Everything ok here?' Both Bobby and Sally's heads shot up in shock to look at the waiter who had creeped up to the table unnoticed to them. Bobby smiled and nodded. <nl> 'I'm in love with my best friend.' Sally blurted out, a look of surprised horror on her face. <nl> The waiter raised his eyebrows in a comical look of shock which quickly gave way to an odd sympathetic and yet encouraging smile. Awkwardly he gently patted her arm and said 'good for you.' He then walked away leaving Sally to process the information and Bobby to eat. <nl> After some time, in fact just as Bobby finished his food and put down his fork, Sally seemed to wake up from her thoughts and stood up out of her chair. <nl> 'I... I should tell him.' Bobby nodded, now only half listening as he started to survey the dessert menu. 'He deserves to know.' Bobby nodded again, not looking up from the menu until he became aware of the silence than had fallen between them. When he did he saw she was sat back down and staring at him sympathetically. He felt a jolt of irritation, and he put his menu down to stare a little harshly back at her. 'I must be the worst date you've ever had. I'm so sorry.' <nl> He could hear the emotion in her voice, he sighed irritably but his expression softened slightly. 'Do I like you? Yes. Did I think we may have a future? Maybe. Do I want to be in love with someone who's in love with someone else entirely? No way. It wouldn't have been very good if I'd gone on to fall in love with you and then you'd realised, would it? I'd rather hear it now than when we were just about to board a plane to a new home. Or on our wedding day. Or at the birth of our first child...' She raised her eyebrow. 'Ok, too far, but you catch my drift. I'd much rather get it all out in the open, and just let you run off into the sunset with him now, rather than be 'that guy' who gets in the way and ends up cast as the jerk despite the fact I'm actually just the guy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time on a date with a woman who isn't emotionally intelligent enough to work out when she's in love with someone despite the fact, from what you've told me, she spends pretty much every waking second of every day either with him or, at the very least, thinking about him...' He took a deep breath, it was a sore subject, this wasn't the first time he'd had to point out to a date that things weren't exactly 'on track' towards a healthy emotional entanglement. She continued to stare at him blankly. He rolled his eyes. 'So no, it's not the worst date I've ever been on.' <nl> She looked a little relieved, and nodded. <nl> They sat awkwardly for a moment before Bobby pointed towards the door and said the most whimsical thing he could think 'go to him...' She mumbled something about paying half of the bill, put some crumpled notes on the table beside her half eaten meal, and left. <nl> Bobby rolled his eyes, and picked up the menu once more. Just as he'd decided he would stick to coffee, he heard a gentle, lady-like cough. He put down his menu to see an attractive female sat opposite him. Like Sally, her eyes were dark, but these had a sultriness to them that replaced Sally's innocent, almost girlish, look. <nl> 'I'm sorry, but I couldn't help overhearing...' <nl> Bobby gestured that he didn't mind. 'Are you here alone?' <nl> 'I wasn't, but I am now.' She smiled again, this time a little mischievously. 'My date had an unhealthy fixation with his work friend that I felt he should explore before we pursued anything.' <nl> Bobby laughed knowingly. 'So he's gone to find her to confess his love?' <nl> She laughed again, 'him... and no, I think he's gone to be alone and process his newly realised sexuality.' <nl> She smiled broadly and extended a slender hand. 'I'm Olivia Johnson. I'm not in love with any of my friends, have no irregular feelings towards my dad and have no exes in the closet other than one who 'ghosted' me a few years ago who I would probably still punch if I saw him now. I am emotionally available and find you, upon first impressions, incredibly attractive.' <nl> Bobby obligingly took her hand and gave it a firm shake. 'I'm Bobby Holden. I have no sexual urges for men, my mother was a perfectly lovely human but I don't want my girlfriend to be anything like her and I would, one day, like a wife and a couple of kids to keep me out of trouble. I am emotionally available and I find you very attractive indeed.' <nl> They sat staring lustfully at each other, until they noticed the waiter stood between them. He looked from one to the other and he blurted out, 'You're both completely insane.' <eos>

<sos> The people burst through the gates of the mansion. <nl> The guards tried to stop them, but they had been armed with electric guitars, a shockingly effective crowd control weapon, but I had taken out their generators. A single riff had been enough. <nl> The guards stood helpless as the people marched in to the mansion with beautiful roses and well kept grass while out there they suffered under this sorry excuse of a musician. I had barely needed to do anything in this city. The embers of the anger were already there, all I had to do was fan them <nl> The people marching to a beat. <nl> It was the familiar THUMP THUMP CLAP. THUMP THUMP CLAP that everyone knew. Individually they would stand no chance against their ruler. She was a powerful musician to have controlled the entire city. But there were hundreds here. Even a simple beat like this, made by relatively unskilled users could pack quite the punch. <nl> As if in response, the mansion began to shake, reverberating with the power of the beat of hundreds. They began to sing the song of the prophets Queen. The musicians, when they had first risen after music became powerful, had tried to wipe out all instruction and memory of music to prevent the common people from learning music and challenging their master. But some tunes do not fade. And while instruments could be taken away, hands and tongues could not. <nl> In response to the music the house literally began to rock back and forth. It would soon crumble. Perhaps I had overestimated this musician, if she could not withstand such a plain assault, it was a wonder she came into control at all. <nl> A single chord reverberated throughout the mansion. The mass stopped as if struck, their beat broken, their voices cut off in shock. And then another chord was hit, and another, and as I watched, the woman came out on the balcony with a portable battery and a guitar and began to play. <nl> The people swayed, entranced. The musician dared not use any physical magic on her own property and people, and so she influenced their minds. I, hidden within the crowd, felt only an intense rage. Rock musicians were the worst. They were merely an imitation of the true art form, the true expression of emotion. Passion, rage, regret it was all there in metal. To deliberately dampen these powers...it was sick. <nl> Well, I knew it would come down to this. <nl> I took out the guitar I had hidden on my back with a coat. It too had a portable source of power. I struck a chord and the air hummed with power. <nl> I took in the vibrations, felt the familiar feeling vibrate in my chest. This. This was power.  The spell their musician had lain shattered like glass. I let out a scream of passion and power and began to literally rise above the crowd, my guitar in hand. <nl> As I rose I could make out the musician better. She wore jeans and denim jacket over a black shirt. Her red hair stood on its end, as if a halo, no doubt responding to her power. Her mouth was curved into a sneer, and her emerald eyes flashed dangerously. <nl> We stood, facing eye to eye, and the crowd below us fell silent, in respect and awe. They were about to witness a duel. These were things of legend, of the past when musicians fought for control over areas. These were stable times, musicians dared not fight each other. They had learned that lesson in the First Wars when we had almost wiped each other out. <nl> "You fool! What are you doing! You dare intrude on *my* domain?" She struck a note that vibrated, and I literally felt her anger wash over me. <nl> Weakling. I roared and responded with my own weapon. And a pillar of white hot flame rushed towards her. <nl> Her eyes widened, but she dissipated the fire with another note. So not completely incompetent. <nl> "You wiped out our people! You mainstream musicians, you pretend to rule over these...*commoners*," I spat out the word, "but you play what they want to listen, you are subject to their whims, their tastes. My people were wiped out, because we played music that was good, not what people perceived as good!" <nl> Her eyes widened in recognition. "No...there are no metal artists left. They were all killed!" <nl> I let forth a fork of lightning in response and laughed. "You did not realize yet?! You thought my magic was your puny *rock*? No. This far greater. Pure energy." <nl> She reflected the lightning away, and fired her own spell, this time with her own music and voice combined. Looks like play time was over. <nl> Still floating I launched into a song. Each note firing a wealth of both physical and mental assaults with it, but she responded in kind with her own song. This was a duel. Before we had simply been trading blows, shit talking so to say. This was true battle. We both knew the idea of our song, what it was supposed to be like, but we had to adapt. Most of our magic collided in the center in sparks or steam, but some got through to both of us. When you see a gout of flame come at you, you change pitch, alter your chord slightly. You sense a weakness in the other's resonance so you capitalize with a hammer-on. You improvise when needed. As death came within inches of me I reveled it, and with a shock, I realized she did too. The anger was gone from her eyes now, just pure joy. This was what we did. <nl> The crowd stood, transfixed. With the wild energy lashing around they should have scrambled, ran away as far as possible. But with the spells of our voices intertwining they could not move. They did not *want* to move. They lay helpless, watching gods battle. <nl> I was almost sad when it was over. She was good, far greater than I had thought possible for a rock artist, but she was limited by her genre. After what seemed like an eternity, she messed up her chord, and her voice faltered in shock. I capitalized. I fired shot after shot of powerful bursts. Her rhythm disrupted, she fell on the defense, try desperately to block my relentless strikes. As she did I moved closer and closer to her, making the strikes come more rapidly. Now she began to tremble, her face contorted in focus and exhaustion, it was inevitable that she mess up. <nl> *There!* <nl> She missed an arc of green energy and it slammed into her, freeing the guitar from her grasp, and it crashed with a final note, while the musician herself landed flat on the ground. <nl> She sat up as I approached, guitar still held loosely in my hands. Her hair had settled down now, but was still disheveled. She looked me in the eyes, her green eyes flashing with indigence and defiance. <nl> She held up her chin, not looking away. "You have bested me. Finish it." <nl> I played a single chord and flash of flame burst out, but she didn't flinch. She would do. <nl> The flame died an inch from her. She looked at me in shock, her mouth slightly open. "Kill you? Don't be ridiculous," I said. "I'm not like your ancestors, I do not waste musical talent. I offer you power, true music, music unlike you have ever wielded." I held out my hand. "The question is, will you accept?" <nl> "And if I don't?," she asked, her voice perfect, light but rich. <nl> I smiled savagely. "You want it. I could see it in your eyes. You play music for its power, for its own sake, not for these," I gestured to the crowd under me which had finally begun to snap out of its daze, "commoners. You understand the power you just saw from me and you want it. Your talent is wasted on rock." <nl> She still looked intensely at me, but gave me the slightest nod. She took my hand. <nl> (minor edits) <nl> EDIT: Whoa! I appreciate all the feedback and kind words, truly, they mean a lot. Also thank you specifically to the stranger who gave me gold! <eos>

<sos> Ma, bless her soul, was a great lady, but she was also a sucker for the con-men that sold stuff on the streets in New York City.  Every year I would take her there for her "New York Minute" as she liked to call her little vacation.  We would stay somewhere in one of the boroughs for 2 or 3 days and go see the sights and take in a Broadway show or two.  Every year, no matter how much I tried to prevent it, she would come home with several "Rolex" watches and a bunch of other junk. <nl> The worst was back in 1997, when she spent $100 on a small radio shack box with 2 leds on it.  The man who sold it to her said that if the led was green, you would visit wherever you were again, however if it was red, that meant that you never again be at that location.  When opened the box up, all it contained was a circuit board covered in plastic (to make it look mysterious and to cover up the 555 chip he most likely used), 2 leds, and a 9 volt battery.  Ma loved her little box, and carried it wherever she went.  Most of the time the little green led was lit, but occasionally when we went out to Pennsylvania or upstate New York, the little red led would light.  Whenever that happened, she would play tourist. <nl> I gave up trying to tell her that the box was fake, and just replaced the 9 volt battery every few months so that "her box" would stay lit.  As the years went by, I didn't really think much more about it, after all, if it made Ma happy, it made me happy.  We still went to New York City every year, and I still had to watch out for getting ripped off.  At least I prevented her from paying $2000 for a box that could contact the dead.  She wanted to talk to Pa, God rest his soul, but I convinced her that she would be able to see or talk to him until the day that she went to join him.  I'm still not sure how I actually talked her out of it - the only thing I can think of is that she is a devout Catholic and figured that using that box would be a sin. <nl> Things were fine until this year's trip to New York City.  Ma wanted to see Cats, so I booked us a room at the Hilton down at the Trade Center for our annual "New York Minute."  Sunday was great, we went to the show, and even had a chance to get over to see Lady Liberty.  Monday was a disaster. <nl> When we got up in the morning, everything was fine until Ma noticed that her little box was glowing red.  I had planned to take her up to the top of the tower to see the city, but she grew increasingly upset when the red led didn't go back to green. <nl> "Ma, how often do we come to the towers?  Just because it is staying red doesn't mean you're gonna die!" <nl> "Sonny, I'm 83 years old and could die at any time.  I'm not ready to go yet!" <nl> "Look, let's just go to the top, then I'll take you to Windows over the World for lunch.  Put the box away, and have a good time.  After all, it was green when you were in the room this morning." <nl> "Fine, but if I die, it's your fault!" <nl> We made it to the top of the tower, saw the sights, then went to lunch.  The little red light never wavered.  I tried taking her shopping in the Trade Center Mall, but all she could do is stare at the red light.  I finally gave up and took her back to the room.  At least the stupid red led finally went off and the green was back on. <nl> "I want to go home!  I'm not gonna die here in New York City!" <nl> "But, Ma, we are paid up through Wednesday, and I thought we could go see the Mets play!" <nl> "Forget the stupid Mets, I WANT TO GO HOME!" <nl> "Fine, Ma, we'll leave tomorrow morning." <nl> "Early?" <nl> "Early." <nl> Tuesday morning rolled around and we were up at 6 am.  As if things weren't bad enough, the stupid box was now red in the room.  Ma, freaked out, and I had to lead her down to the parking deck.  I was going to check out, but decided to forget it and just eat the extra day.  We finally left the Trade Center complex about 7, and headed towards the Holland Tunnel, and home.  I kept talking to her about anything and everything to keep her mind off of that stupid box. <nl> "The box is green." <nl> "What box, Ma?"  We had been talking about Christmas presents when she said that. <nl> "My box, of course!  What are you, daft?" <nl> Sure enough the little green led is lit, and stayed lit as we entered the tunnel.  Thank God it stayed green, Ma was beginning to calm down and not look like she was gonna have a stroke any minute now. <nl> "Turn on Howard." <nl> "What, Ma?" <nl> "Turn on Howard!  I want to see what he is up to today." <nl> Thankful she was acting somewhat normal, I turned on Howard Stern.  I can't stand his show, but Ma loves it.  As we put the City behind us for another year, I gleefully ignored Stern's babble until they mentioned something about a plane hitting one of the towers.  My face went white as I realized what he was talking about - the place we had just left.  For once I agreed with Stern - how the hell could a plane hit the trade center tower on a lovely sunny day? <nl> "Sonny, I told you my box was a good buy!  We coulda been hit by an airplane!" <nl> "Yes, Ma." <eos>

<sos> "Okay, here we go," June said, spinning the wheels on her mechanical glove, which sent her on a dizzying ride through space and time. <nl> She landed in a pub buzzing with activity, colorful bottles lined the wall behind the bar and yellow light radiated through heaps of stacked cups. Women in long dresses and updos danced to the live tunes of a jazz band, while the bartender idly polished the counter. <nl> June made her way through the thick vapors of cigar smoke towards one of the quieter corners of the pub. A man in a black suit and hat sat alone in a booth, swiveling cubes of ice in what undoubtedly was a glass of scotch. <nl> "Fashionable as ever," he noted, raising his glass unenthusiastically at June. <nl> "Well, it's not like I had time to change," June said, looking down at her wrinkly renaissance dress. <nl> "Time, sure." He pulled out a pack of cigarettes from his chest pocket. "Want a smoke?" <nl> "Come on, Roman," June said. "You know I don't smoke, and besides, we've got important things to do." <nl> "Important, right." He said, inhaling deeply. "Ah, that's the stuff." <nl> "Why don't you start by giving me an update?" <nl> Roman leaned back, regarding her with an amused look. "Why don't you start by sitting down for a moment, Sweetheart?" <nl> June felt like kicking him. This was why she hated the fifties. Roman basically turned into a Philip Marlowe with an impossible reluctance to cooperate. <nl> "Fine," she said, with a resigned sigh. "Buy me a drink." <nl> "Buy your own drinks," Roman said, yawning. <nl> "You know, I like you way better in the seventies." <nl> "It's the hair, isn't it?" he said, winking. <nl> "Tell me one thing, Roman," June said, snatching away the cigarette he was just about to light. "If I were one of those dainty women over there - one of those swooning helpless things, without a hint of independence - would you help me if I came running to you?" <nl> "Swooning, huh?" He emptied his scotch. "If I remember correctly, back in the 16th century-" <nl> "Yeah, yeah, I couldn't handle the corsets, whatever," she said, rolling her eyes. "What would it take for you to give me the damn update?" <nl> "How about you get out of that moldy old dress and get the next round?" Roman said, nodding at his empty glass. "I haven't seen those lovely butt cheeks since Leonardo painted Mona." <nl> "Why did I marry you back in the Antiques, I simply don't see it," June said. <nl> "I think it was the hair." <nl> "You know, I was going to give you the night of your life, but I guess you'll have to wait until Zeppelin releases their first album, I mean, it's only another twenty years." <nl> "I'm sure it'll be worth the wait," Roman said and got up. "Until then there are some swooning ladies by the bar, who appear to be in need of my immediate help." <nl> June cursed through her teeth and watched him strut over to the dance floor. Be that way, she thought and spun the wheel on her glove again. <eos>

<sos> "Do you remember when we first met?" she asked, pouring the last of the last bottle. <nl> I smiled.  "I was eighteen.  Physics class on the Ohio State campus." <nl> "Yes?  Tell me what you first thought."  Her dark eyes seemed to swallow all of my peripheral vision like an entire night full of stars on the Mediterranean, centuries before I was born. <nl> "I was stunned.  You were so beautiful and so smart.  You seemed to know your way about the world in every way.  How nature worked.  How people worked.  Like you were ageless." <nl> "You guessed me from the start!"  She laughed. <nl> We had fallen in love and learned about each other.  Loving an immortal turned out to have some complications.  For her, how to keep it fresh?  She had been alive for more than two millenia and seen it all.  For me, how to not die?  Turns out a time machine does not make a mortal live any longer. <nl> She had a plan.  A plan given to her by a strange augurer way in her past.  We had no idea of the origin of this plan, but we knew it would work. <nl> After a pause, she asked, "Tell me where is this Ohio State." <nl> I described to her a country that would be discovered a thousand years in her future and a culture that could not possibly make sense in any context of this age.  How we studied in the library together and forged this strange bond while working on temporal research.  A young physics prodigy and an immortal of ageless wisdom. <nl> "So," I asked her, "do you remember when we first met?" <nl> "Of course!" she replied, a great mischief in her eyes.  "The great steps of the city of Parsa!" <nl> Her eyes grew distant.  "I was eighteen.  A thousand years ago, I had no idea I would live so long.  It is still so fresh in my mind." <nl> "I guess I was persuasive.  Or will be!" <nl> "Oh, I was so rebellious!  To be seduced by a strange foreign man!" <nl> She told me of her unbridled passions, her indignant family and flights in the darkness.  Strange stories of living for ever and taming time as a ship tames the waves. <nl> We had been living here in Cyprus for a year.  We dated each other one year at a stretch, together in the most interesting places on earth, at our whim.  Our year here had drawn to a close and it was time to move on.  There was no packing to be done.  The time machine would move only itself and my naked body. <nl> "Where will I find you?" I asked her.  This always filled me with dread, but of course she was certain she would find me. <nl> "Alexandria.  At the library."  That mischievous grin.  Her and libraries.  "Take one month to get there, and then go back exactly 100 years.  Meet me on the day of Mercuralia." <nl> I just drank in her beauty for a moment.  It would be hard to be away from her for more than a month.  I hoped that she would remember me after a hundred years.  But of course I already knew she would- for me, that year-long date was last year.  And in due course she asked, "Where shall I find you?" <nl> "Constantinople.  One hundred years from now." <nl> Her eyes fell.  It was hard for her.  It broke my heart but part of me was reassured that her love endured.  I sometimes wondered if she took lovers in the long intervals, but I really did not care as long as we came back to each other. <nl> We kissed passionately one final time on this island.  But before we parted, she stopped me. <nl> "When you go back to Alexandria.  When you arrive in the past.  Find a sword, first thing.  Even before you find clothes." <nl> She looked worried.  I must have looked bewildered. <nl> "When we met-- when we meet...  in the library, you told me to remind you." <nl> She held me a moment longer. <nl> "It will be alright," she added.  "Whatever it was, you were unharmed.  But you wanted me to tell you, you will need that sword." <nl> We parted.  She would live out the next hundred years to meet a slightly younger me in Constantinople.  And I would travel to Alexandria, then hop backwards in time to meet an ageless her. <eos>

<sos> "The government must fall!" Katy shouted, loud and clear. Of course, nobody was listening, but still, she shouted. <nl> Ever since she turned 15, around four years ago, Katylin developed a hatred for the "corrupt" government. The way they build soldiers for a war, and take money from poor people. The way they force having green energy, though it reduces jobs for the people. The way they make you pay an extra 8% for everything, just because they *have to* use our money. "Ugh, can't they just use the rich people's money?" she'd say. <nl> But, I digress. Armed with nothing but her lucky bow and a single arrow (seriously, a single arrow), Katy plans to overthrow the government and eventually turn the nation into a communist republic. I don't even know why she has a bow. It's not like it'll do anything significant, other than give someone a small wound. She doesn't even have bow training! And really, could she not build arrows out of a stick, pidgeon feather, sharp pebble, and some duct tape? I mean, that's the simplest thing to build. It's not like she has to smith a sword from scratch, which, even though she can't smith to save her life, would still be more effective than a bow and arrow. <nl> Sorry, I go on tangents sometimes. It's just hard being her *only* friend, and having to help her overthrow the (perfectly good) government is annoying. I go to college from Monday thru Friday, and I have a shit-load of homework over the weekend. I don't have the time to help her "ooh overthrow the government ooh". The only thing I *can* provide is smithing services, and she already broke the two steel swords I supplied her with. Not only did they take weeks to smith, she said they "just fell apart". Baloney! Those swords were my finest work! Even Smithmaster McDuff from my smithing class said I had the finest blades he'd ever seen! <nl> Also, the reason she doesn't use a gun, which are legal to carry openly, provided you have a permit, is because they're "not intimidating enough, duh!" Really? Not as intimidating as a bow and *single arrow*? Ooh, I'm trembling in my tiny sneakers, Katy. <nl> Anyways, here's the "valiant tale of our brave hero" she's forcing me to write. Just know that I'm exaggarating every detail, okay? Now, then: <nl> *Our tale begins with Katylin Edwards, age 19. As a teenager, she had grown to despise the awful, corrupt system. The slimy presidents with their filthy lies, and the treasury that just takes money from innocent people! They go to war with other nations, build armies to fight, and then... they try to make peace, as if it never happened.* <nl> *Fed up with this system, Katy took action. She armed herself with her lucky bow and arrow, smithed by her closest friend, and left her home to start the revolution. You see, Katy loved the martial charm of ancient weapons. A gun would simply not suit her, no matter how powerful. And, she only took one arrow, a symbol of her... uh...* <nl> *Katy took to the streets, gaining loyal followers to her cause. Everyone resented the corrupt system with which they had to deal. She captured their hearts, and their minds, building a small army.* <nl> *At dawn of an unknown day, they struck the White House. The battle between the people, and the system, lasted six days and six nights. But, just before midnight, Katy pulled a trick-shot with her single arrow, hitting the president in the heart. A perfect shot from such a perfect leader.* <nl> *She took the nation by storm, quickly making her the most loved president in history. Katylin Edwards, we salute you.* <nl> Of course, she's actually going to become a shit leader who just spends all day bragging about how good she is, but that's between you and I. <nl> ***** <nl> *Creative criticism appreciated.

<sos> They came for him at dawn, screaming across the dusty plain, throwing up a choking cloud in their wake which turned the sun red. He knew this was an entirely dramatic decision, since she'd set up camp sometime the afternoon before. Within sight of the city's towers. <nl> The gates and walls of Newhaven were more than strong enough to keep them out, but that wasn't what he wanted. His men had their orders, all civilians had been evacuated to the bunkers. They were ready. He was ready for his audience. <nl> They burst through the gate, apparently not even registering how easy it all was. Either they were too used to attacking the smaller settlements and steads around Newhaven, or this was their first raid. Either way, it was going to be their last. It wasn't every day the bandits actually presented themselves to you, after all. <nl> She took an astonishly long time to reach him, though he deliberately stayed in his office. She must have stopped for a rousing speech or two along the way. He stood wearily as she burst through the door, bow at the ready, dark hair flying dramatically. Only her closest lieutenants were with her, each similarly armed with longbows, crossbows and swords. <nl> "Hello, *father*!" She spat, tossing her head. <nl> "Jane." He said, sighing inwardly. "Glad you're home safe." <nl> "I've returned!" She said, in what she obviously believed was a fierce, rabble-rousing voice. In reality, she just sounded like a sixteen-year-old girl having a temper tantrum. <nl> "I see that." <nl> "I've returned," she repeated, her eyes flashing, "to free the people from the yoke of their cruel tyrant! I've returned, Father, so that we can rebuild society as something good for all, so that my child will never know a world of oppression, indecency, and indignity!" <nl> At that she threw a look at Jaime, Tom Brandon's eldest boy, who was stood right behind her. It was obviously meant to be a meaningful glance, or maybe a longing one. Instead they both just looked a bit constipated. The pause gave him a chance to process what she'd said, however. He slapped a hand over his face, groaning. <nl> "Fuck's sake, Janey, you're pregnant too?" <nl> "This isn't about who I choose to love!" She cried dramatically, her face turning red as a bead of sweat began to trickle from her hairline. "This is about..." <nl> "It's about me grounding you," he said sharply, dropping his hand. He gestured, and his men came forward, rifles at the ready. Jane's followers looked uncertain now. "It's about you thinking we love Hannah more. What this is about, Jane, is a child having a tantrum and running off to join some bandits with her friends. That's what this is about." <nl> "I didn't join the bandits!" She yelled. That attempt at a revolutionary tone had vanished now. She stamped her foot. "They're temporary *allies*. I'll reward them when I take over, so..." <nl> "They came with you because they thought they'd get to pillage the city while you were up here." He said, deliberately staying calm. "Don't worry, I'll deal with them. Kids, you hand your weapons over to my men now. Your parents have been worried sick about you all." <nl> The other kids, staring down the barrels of actual guns with the crackle of gunfire outside, handed over their gear willingly. One, a girl who couldn't have been older than twelve, started to cry. Jane stamped her foot again and shrieked wordlessly. <nl> "You always have to ruin *everything*!" She screamed, "I'm going to take over the city and free everyone from slavery, and *you can't stop me*!" <nl> "Jane, no one here's a slave. This is the only truly safe place for half a continent. People are happy to be here. You've been out there now, you've see. That, haven't you? Anyway, you'll get your chance to lead when I retire..." <nl> "I'm not waiting until then! You're a monster!" <nl> She loosed the arrow - the look on her face suggested she hadn't meant to do it, or maybe that she was surprised she had dared too. The arrow flew surprisingly true (she must have been practicing) and lodged in his vest. He took half a step back, bumping into the desk, and let out an irritated grunt. Before he could do anything else there was a deafening report, followed by a heavy thud. <nl> He looked down at his crumpled daughter, horrified. Then she rolled over, pressed a hand to the exit wound just above her hip (which was, thankfully, oozing rather than gushing) and began to weep hysterically. <nl> "Daddy! He shot me, you let him shoot me!" <nl> He sighed heavily. "Dave, take the others to the station, contact their parents. Henry, Bill, you take my arch-nemesis to Doctor Jennings, please? And Gary," he looked at the man who had fired, who was now frozen in place, looking appalled, "please don't do that again." <eos>

<sos> "Come!" The paw on the back of my head scratches through my fur. I snap at Dodger. He still treats me like a pup, and he is old. Old or not, he manages to catch me and roll me over. I bat at his chest and he snaps and growls near my ears until I surrender. <nl> "Insolent pup," he growls again as he lets me up. <nl> "I'm not a pup!" I stand up and shake. "I have earned my name. The Lady gave me a name!" <nl> "Dodger! Sapphire!" The girl's voice from inside makes me perk up my ears. <nl> "The Lady calls again. Come!" He turns back toward the house and trots over. I follow, and playfully snap at his golden tail. He ignores me because I am obeying. <nl> The Lady opens the door. The youngest. Not quite 100 years yet. She just came of age last week, and there was a big celebration. I was quite popular that night, as her friends gave me many treats. There was talk among the adults about her going away. She said I would go with her, and that made me happy. I wag my tail at her. The Lady pats my head, but then she kneels down and hugs Dodger. The Lady is crying. <nl> "What's wrong?" I ask her. She only reaches out and pats my head again. She doesn't understand me yet. Not like the Master. The Master knows what we say. He understands Dodger more easily. And then I notice that Dodger is not wagging his tail. He is also sad. <nl> "Dodger?" I demand. I muscle my way into the hug and lick the Lady's face. She laughs a little. "Dodger, what's wrong?" <nl> "I have to go see the Master," he says. He breaks away from the hug and leaves me with the Lady, who hugs me now instead. I sniff her. She smells of the chemicals that Master smells like all the time now. I listen. I can hear the Mistress talking, talking to the Peddler of the chemicals. I nudge out of the hug to follow Dodger, up the stairs, up to Master's room. <nl> "Hey Sapphire," says the Mistress when I enter. She rubs me behind the ears the way I like. I tell her thank you. <nl> "Beautiful Husky," says the Peddler. I greet him and he pets me. He seems all right, but for the odd smell. <nl> "She belongs to my granddaughter." The Mistress's voice sounds odd, like she is in distress, but I smell no danger. <nl> "Ah." The Peddler is packing up. "If you need anything else..." <nl> "Thank you." The Mistress walks out with him. <nl> Dodger is on the bed. He lays his head on Master's chest, who looks asleep. The chemicals make me want to sneeze, but Dodger had told me that is disrespectful. There's another smell too: it's been present for a long time, but today it is stronger than before. <nl> I walk up to the side of the bed. "Dodger!" I speak loudly to get his attention. <nl> He opens his big brown eyes. "Quiet, pup," he says. "And go away." <nl> "No! Tell me what is going on. Why does the Master smell like this? Why is my Lady crying?" I put my paws on the bed to look at Master. His skin is very sallow and thin. The veins stand out. <nl> "I am the Seventh," says Dodger. He lifts his head from Master's chest. "My family was made part of the Master's family generations ago, when he was just a pup." Dodger looks at his Master's face. "The First was named Dodger as well. He named me, knowing I would be the last." <nl> "The last?" I whine. "Dodger, what are you talking about?" <nl> Dodger sighs. "You're too young to understand." <nl> "I am not a puppy!" I say it loudly. "I am not!" <nl> The Master opens his eyes, and I wonder if I have made a mistake. But he laughs and reaches out to scratch my ears. Like the Mistress, he knows how to scratch properly. <nl> "Hullo, Sapphire," he says. I wag my tail. "Be a good dog for Jenny, mm?" <nl> "I will," I tell him. I feel Dodger looking at me, all solemn. <nl> "Good girl," says Master. "I don't have long before I go. Dodger will take care of me." <nl> I hear a car pull up the driveway outside. It's a large one. I run to the window and look out: it's big and white, and strange humans in uniform get out. The Mistress begins to talk with them. I run back to the bed. <nl> I look at Dodger. "He can't leave. You can't leave!" I whine. <nl> "Hey, hey," says Master. He catches me near the ears again, gently. "I told you, Dodger will take care of me." <nl> I whine at them both. "You can't leave!" <nl> The men come upstairs with a bed on wheels. The Lady comes with them and takes me aside. <nl> "Gotta move the dog." <nl> "I'll move him," says the Mistress. She lifts Dodger off the bed. He seems older than he did a little while ago. I whine at the Lady, but she just holds me and cries. <nl> "He can't leave!" I tell her, but she doesn't understand yet. "They won't bring him back!" <nl> But he does leave. The Lady just holds me and weeps while the vehicles drive away. <nl> We go downstairs and outside. Dodger walks down the driveway, following the vehicles. <nl> "Dodger, wait!" I strain against the Lady's hands. She calls for Dodger, and he waits a moment. I get free. <nl> "Dodger, we have to bring the Master back!" I tell him. I could still hear the vehicles on the road. The Lady was running up behind me. <nl> He wags his tail at me. "He told you to be a good dog and take care of the Lady. Be good, Sapphire." He licks my face and runs off, golden fur shining in the sunlight. Lady holds onto me and calls for Dodger, but he disobeys. I had never seen him disobey before. He had never called me by my name before. <nl> I only saw Dodger one more time: we found him at the meadow where the Master's body was laid, curled against the crossed stone that marked it. <nl> He was the Seventh of his family. I am the First of mine. <nl> --- <nl> *Wow, I'm overwhelmed by all the feedback and the comments. I'm so glad so many people enjoyed this!* <eos>

<sos> Moreover, the "flowers" are wrapped in sheets produced from the ground, reconstituted, and subsequently desiccated flesh of their cousins, "trees." <nl> It is usually the male who presents this gift to the female, and the female must first react with a loud cry, to express horror at the evidence of slaughter. This is to demonstrate that she is not bloodthirsty, and will not eat their young. <nl> If the female is receptive to the male's advances, she will then accept the corpses, and display the bodies until they shrivel and mummify, at which point they are no longer attractive to her, and will be removed. She will keep these corpses as long as possible, for the aroma of their decaying tissues is pleasing to her, and, indeed, this species has been known to mate in the torn limbs of "flowers," known as "petals," in the chamber that they retire to, following their bonding ceremony, called a "honeymoon suite." <nl> If she is not receptive to the male's advances, she will still accept them. However, rather than keep them to the point of mummification, she will bring the fresh corpses with her to her "office," where she competes with other members of her species to see who can remain for the longest period of time in front of a "monitor." A "monitor" in the "office" is a light emitting device that causes pain, and therefore functions as a litmus test for which individuals have the greatest toughness, and fitness for survival. The goal is to attain such great lengths of exposure in this setting that they permanently destroy their capacity to feel, and thereby transcend the limits of pain. <nl> In any case, the female will display the corpses in the "office" to demonstrate to others that she is so desired that she can afford to throw away the corpses pre-maturely, without striving to keep their aroma. This is a part of something called "office politics," which we will discuss in the next chapter. <eos>

<sos> It turned the sheerest blonde hair into midnight black. Andrew tested it on himself - it didn't budge, not even when he deliberately muttered something mildly forgetful, that should have sent tendrils of blonde creeping back. <nl> As he stared in the mirror, he knew what *could* happen if he were to market this widely. People would go rabid over this stuff. He could charge them ludicrous sums of money, and they'd still buy it. He could be a billionaire by the month's end. Few people had completely black hair, unless they chose to never say anything. It simply happened to everyone: you made a dumb comment, or forgot something obvious - and the blonde streaks appeared. <nl> And then there were those born blonde. <nl> Andrew turned from the mirror and approached the bedroom. Alison was still lying in the same spot, staring listlessly at the ceiling. Her hair was swept in careless blonde waves around her. <nl> "It worked," he said quietly, and put the bottle on the table. <nl> She looked at it, and a spark of life entered her eyes. She'd watched him work on it for months, but had never really thought it would work. It was a sweet gesture - her boyfriend trying to work on a solution for the problem that had crippled her entire life. But it couldn't *really* work. <nl> "It turns your hair...black?" she said, so softly he had to ask her to repeat herself. <nl> He leaned over and kissed her. "Pitch black. Now, please, go dye it. And go to the interview. Please." <nl> Her face crumbled and she turned away from him. Like all born-blondes, she had never been given a chance. She'd fought her way through university, to prove she wasn't stupid. Some of her professors had cheered and patted themselves on the back for being progressive enough to allow a born-blonde in the classroom. <nl> Pretending it mattered, that society was progressing beyond its prejudices. An empty gesture, in the end. No-one trusted that she could do the job, even with her degree. She was, quite simply, blonde. The brilliance Andrew saw every day, the edge of her humour and mind, didn't matter. No-one's hair turned black from moments of cleverness. <nl> "Dye it," he whispered. "Please. Just dye it, and go out. Try one more time, for me." <nl> She took a deep breath, and finally nodded. She heaved herself up and grabbed the bottle to disappear into the bathroom. He heard the sound of running water. When she emerged, her hair was a sleek and shiny black. She smiled tremulously at herself in the mirror, and ran her fingers through it. <nl> "You should share it," she said. "You should give it out to everyone. For free. Stop this from happening to anyone else." <nl> He saw again the countless faces of those who jeered at his girlfriend on the street, who refused to listen to a word she said, just on principle. The people who nudged each other and stifled grins when she tried to make a point. The people who had allowed the self-assured, happy woman he'd fallen in love with to fade to this shadow of herself. <nl> "I will," he promised. "But once everyone has black hair, it won't matter. I just want you to get a little revenge, first. I want you to go out there and listen as they beg you to work for them. Please - go kick ass now." <nl> She tied her hair up, and he thought he saw a glimmer of her old self in the set of her mouth and eyes. <nl> She turned to kiss him . <nl> "Just be yourself, ok?" he said, and hugged her close. <nl> -------------- <nl> Hope you enjoyed my story!

<sos> "We have it, sir." <nl> "Excellent," I said, "now hurry up and put her in the interrogation chamber." <nl> "Sir!" The soldier rushed to comply and hoisted the repulsive thing, still passed out, and tied her to a chair. <nl> "Make sure its binds are secured," I told him, "we don't want her getting free." <nl> I sat across from the captive, I wanted her to see me when she first regained consciousness, to know that her life was over. <nl> I didn't have to wait long. Soon the thing stirred, and reflexively strained against her bonds. I stiffened for a second, but the creature gave up, unable to break free. I let out a shaky breath that I didn't even realize I had been holding. <nl> Soon it opened its sharp blue eyes suddenly and looked right at me. To its credit, it didn't flinch. <nl> I gave it a smile. <nl> "So Madame Chair, is it?" I said, savoring the moment, "welcome to hell." <nl> Her eyes flickered about, taking in the sights, my red skin, pointy tail, my horns. The temperature, which humans find uncomfortable apparently, and the sharp odor of brimstone. And just for a moment her cool facade slipped, a crack in her mask, and her eyes widened slightly, her lips parted. <nl> And then it was gone as swiftly as it had come. But I saw it, I saw the thing's fear. It felt good to know that their leader could feel it. <nl> She looked at me again, with that same intense gaze that commanded authority, it was no wonder she became the leader of the Earth Congress. "It's a little warm," she said, actually managing to smile, "and these bonds are a bit too tight, do you mind loosening them?" <nl> I laughed mirthlessly, the laughter not reaching my eyes. Laughed at the courage of this woman, her ability to make jokes, to retain some semblance of control despite her situation. Laughed at our final victory. <nl> "I see through your facade, Madame, talk all you want, you'll be doing a lot of that whether you want it or not soon enough. You know this not a welcoming party." <nl> "So," she said, leaning back and managing to look as comfortable as possible in her bonds, "let's skip the part where I refuse to tell you my plans, and you scare and intimidate me, and then you torture me so much that I eventually give in and tell you everything anyways, just that time without my fingers." <nl> "Let's start simply then," I said, slightly uncomfortable by her forthright manner, "how did you invade hell?" We already knew the answer to this, and we suspected the humans did not know that we knew. I wanted to test her honesty. <nl> She shrugged. "It was simple really, we managed to reverse engineer-" I held up my hand. <nl> "I'm sorry, reverse engineer?" I asked, not knowing the phrase. <nl> "To build something by looking at a complete version," she explained. I motioned for her to continue. She nodded, "Yes...reverse engineer one of your imp nests that spawned imps from hell directly to Earth, and managed to make a device that does the opposite. This also gave us the space-time co-ordinates of hell, so we knew where and when to go." <nl> I pretended to frown, as if thinking if this would work, but my mind was racing. She was telling the truth, we had lost an imp nest and we had figured that's how the humans had made their way back in. <nl> "Alright, let's continue. Where will the human forces be retreating?" <nl> She pretended to look confused, "I'm sorry, what do you mean retreat?" <nl> I smiled savagely. "Do you take us for fools, Madame Chair? You think we would infiltrate the very heart of your planet and capture you just to ask questions? No, you know as well as we do that we have cut off the head of the snake, without you the humans will halt their offensive." <nl> And what an offensive it had been. In the first months of 2021 we had pushed the humans back, taking their cities and killing their people. But after the surprise had faded the humans had pushed back. *Hard*. Their...technology let them perform wonders that we thought they were incapable of. We could launch fireballs but they could shoot iron balls from some sort of hand held device. We had demons with wings, but they flew in metal birds. We had leviathans in the oceans but they had steel titans that sailed *on* the oceans. <nl> We were pushed back, and had retreated to hell after extensive casualties. We thought we would lick our wounds, bide our time, strike when the humans were weak, when we became a myth once again. We had the patience for millennia after all. <nl> But then they came to us. <nl> They tore into us, like insects they marched across the planes of oblivion, destroying our structures, freeing our prisoners. They recruited long dead humans, the most vicious of them, and turned them against us. They had marched to the palace of hell itself, seeking to capture our leader, the Devil himself.  Without him we would fall apart, the different species of demons would turn on each other, and the war would be over. <nl> But that had not happened. And I turned back to the woman gloating, "Just as we cannot fight without our leader, your humans will crumble without you. They are finished." <nl> Her face had paled, and I bore on, "don't worry though, we will not kill you, we will keep you alive for a *long* time, before your release comes and you go to heaven, longer that you would have lived on Earth." I paused dramatically, savoring the look of utter fear on her face,  "Of course you might not find it as...comfortable as Earth." <nl> I had expected her to cower, to cry, perhaps even revert back to her stoic mask, not showing emotions. <nl> I did not expect her to laugh. <nl> "You fools, you sorry, poor fools!" She said, gasping for breath. "I..I just couldn't keep up the act anymore, my God." I flinched as she said the last word, but remained confused. <nl> "I was told you didn't understand human psychology, but delusion of this scale I had not even imagined." She was actually crying from laughter, and now *she* smiled smugly at me. "I have a second, you idiot, I will be replaced and the humans will continue attacking. This is not some sort of movie where if you kill the leader, all the underlings fall apart. Killing me does nothing." <nl> I sat back, stunned. She had been acting, pretending to be afraid, pretending to show her 'true' emotions. And the human assault would not stop. "You lie!" I screamed at her, "all species' fall without their leader. You kill a pack leader and you become leader, you kill the Devil and the demons fall apart. This is the nature of the world!" <nl> She just continued laughing. <nl> The Devil needed to be evacuated! The humans may not need their leader but we did. I turned to shout orders to the soldiers outside, and they hurried away, reporting to the Devil. <nl> I turned back to the woman. "Your humans may advance, but you will not, we captured you, and rest assured you will not see the light of day again." <nl> She stopped laughing and smiled at me. A smile that chilled me to the bone. "What the hell makes you think you were capable enough to capture me...if we didn't let you." <nl> The soldier I had commanded to report to the devil returned, one of the human hand devices in his hand, and pointed it at me. <nl> "Betrayal," I whispered. Then, fiercely, I turned to the soldier, "Traitor!" <nl> He shrugged, untying the human's bonds. "I like to be on the winning side." <nl> The woman, now free from her bonds turned to me. "Thank you for bringing me to the most secure location in hell. The tracker I have swallowed has alerted my forces where this is. We will release the most fearsome humans in history from this facility." <nl> She turned to walk away. "Kill it," she said in a dismissive gesture, "we have work to do." <nl> "Sorry boss," the soldier said with a casual shrug, and shot me. <nl> Blackness ensued. <nl> *** <nl> (minor edits) <nl> If you enjoyed, check out my new subreddit [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/) <nl> **Due to popular demand, I present to you, [Part 2!](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5hk0nq/wp_2021_hell_invades_earth_2022_earth_invades_hell/db1got6/)** <nl> EDIT: /u/YouWriteITalk was kind enough to narrate this story.

<sos> Agatha knocked on the door of a small, dilapidated cabin in the woods. It was a dreary day, with clouds that blanketed the sky and hung low to the Earth. She saw someone part the curtains in the window of the little shack as a breeze whipped up and blew her silver hair around her face. The door opened a few inches. <nl> "Have you got the silver?" a man growled from inside. Agatha extended a small leather pouch toward the door. From the inside she could hear several children crying. "Get back!" he snarled to someone inside, "This doesn't concern you!" The man snatched the purse from Agatha's hand and opened the door fully. The man pointed to a girl, dressed in rags and clutching a younger sister. Even caked with mire and soot, Agatha could tell she was a beautiful creature. She started to smile a toothy grin, wrinkles hoisted up around her eyes. <nl> Agatha was 12 thousand years old, and while she could change her appearance at will, she chose to walk the earth in her true form: hobbled, hunched, wrinkled and warted. The girl let out a piercing scream, as they often did. Her father yelled louder, "QUIET". The girl stopped screaming, but her mouth still hung open. <nl> Agatha looked around the room. "First I'll need permission from both the mother and the father to enter. Then I can take her by the hand and we'll be on our way." "Mother's dead," the man said flatly. "Why else do you think you're here? I can hardly take care of any of them." Three other children sat clutching one another on a bed, faces all ruddy with dirt. "Ah. I see. I'll just need yours then," replied Agatha. "Come on then. Get it over with." <nl> The girl looked at her father in horror and began to sob, throwing herself on the floor. Agatha stepped into the room and past the other children. She knelt down beside the girl, put a hand on her back and looked up at her father. "What's her name?" she asked. "Lilith," he said, staring at the door. "Lilith," Agatha whispered to the girl. The girl buried her face in the crook of her arm, still crying on the floor. "Lilith, can I show you something? I think you'll like it." The girl peeked one eye above her arm. "Good," Agatha said warmly. She then sat all the way on the floor, next to Lilith and produced from inside the sleeve of her robe, something small that fluttered about in her hand. Lilith looked up from her arm completely now. It was the most beautiful golden house sparrow. It sat in Agatha's palm and radiated light and warmth. The girl sat up now and looked on at the bird at eye level. It hopped about in Agatha's hand and began to sing." "Is that, real?" Lilith asked timidly. "Oh, everything is real, dear. Everything you can think of." Agatha said. Would you like to see something else? "Okay," Lilith mumbled. Agatha laid one finger on the top of the bird's head and immediately it was turned to solid gold. A golden chain slithered through the air, appearing one link at a time, and joined with the sparrow. Agatha held up a radiant gold necklace. Lilith gasped, "Did you kill it? Is it dead?" Agatha laughed, "Oh no. I can turn it back anytime I like." She paused, "And so can you. Would you like to try?" Lilith outstretched her hand and grasped the necklace. It was warm to the touch, she thought she could almost feel it pulsing. "Just tap it with your index finger on the top of its head, and imagine it's a bird again. It's that simple. Go on." <nl> All of the other children and even the girl's father were watching on with mouths agape. Lilith held the golden sparrow in her hand and tapped it gently on the head. It immediately sprung to life and flitted around the room. The girl shrieked with delight, her former sorrow nowhere to be found. Agatha laughed and clapped her hands, "I knew it! I've felt it for a long while now, in these woods, and it was you." Lilith looked puzzled, "What do you mean?" "Ah, nevermind for now. There's plenty of time for that later," Agatha said. "Your sparrow's name is Oscen. She is yours and will come whenever you breathe her name." "Oscen!" Lilith called. A streak of gold flashed across the ceiling and landed on the girl's head. Oscen chittered happily and played with pieces of her hair. "Ha! You see! That's perfect." Agatha reached to put a finger under the bird's belly. It hopped onto her hand and she placed it on the girl's shoulder." Lilith beamed and tried to look at the bird. <nl> "Now Lilith," Agatha said quietly. "I have a great many things to tell you, but you'll have to come with me." The girl looked around the room. Everyone looked on completely bewildered. "I want to go," a voice squeaked from the bed. One of the other children hit the girl that spoke up. "Shut up!" she hissed. "Can Sarah come with me?" Lilith asked Agatha quietly. "No," her father answered. "I'm afraid your father is right. You see, Lilith. You're special. I could bring Sarah, but she would not be able to learn and do the things that you could. It would be cruel," replied Agatha. <nl> Lilith was quiet for a moment and held the sparrow in her palm. "Will I do more of this?" "It doesn't matter what you do, girl. You've been paid for. You have to leave!" her father bellowed. Agatha sprang up from the floor with a peculiar spryness for a woman her age and shouted, "That is quite enough!" and pinched her fingers together. The man yelled back but no sound came out. He stopped and looked wide eyed at Agatha. Suddenly the man bolted toward the woman and reached his arms out in an effort to throttle her neck. Agatha threw her hands up in front of her face to protect herself. She was caught off guard and braced for contact, but it never came. She looked up at the man and he had simply frozen in place. His entire body, save for his eyes racing around the room, was completely still. The children, while not paralyzed, were completely quiet, stricken with fear. Agatha looked over at Lilith. She was standing feet apart, staring at her father with clutched fists, Oscen still on her shoulder. Agatha slowly walked up to the girl and lay a hand on her arm. She was shaking and a tear streamed down her cheek. "Lilith," she said softly. "Lilith take my hand and let's go. I think you know now, and probably have always known that you weren't meant to be here. Come with me." <nl> Lilith softened and looked at Agatha. After a moment she placed her small hand in the old woman's. They walked toward the door. "Hey!" Sarah yelled, "You can't leave him like that! You have to fix him! LILITH!" "He'll be fine." Agatha said coldly and opened the door, still clasping the girl's hand. The two walked outside and let the door close behind them. Remarkably, the sky had completely cleared, revealing the most beautiful shade of azure the two had ever seen. <nl> *Edit: There are two more sections floating around here somewhere. Thank you everyone for your kind words. For fans of Sarah, take heart. We'll get there. <nl> *Double Edit:  If you would like to keep going on this adventure, I started a Tumblr (lol) [which can be found here](http://eternizemecaptain.tumblr.com/post/155532294120/part-5). <nl> You guys are seriously awesome. I posted the last part that I'll post on this thread somewhere below. If you want to keep up with the stories, I would love to keep hearing your thoughts! Thanks everyone! <eos>

<sos> We've tied Sympathy to a railing on the catwalk over the Void of Lost Remembrance. She does not cry, though I'd prefer that she did. Instead, she twists loosely in the breeze, trying, trying to understand what we've done. <nl> "They have families," she says. "Don't you care at least about the families they left behind?" <nl> We close the door and leave her there, so we no longer have to listen. In all this time, in all these years, she has never gotten better. She is always looking outward, towards people and places and things that are not us, and worries about *them* and *their happiness*. She cannot understand why that doesn't matter. We cannot convince her. <nl> So she will twist over the chasm for a time. And we will go back to work. <nl> Pride is working the controls, alone, as usual. We watch as the Husk glides through white and green halls, thin carpet stretched over cement, closed doors on either side. The Husk knocks twice on one door that is entirely like all the rest, and a woman inside says, "Come in." <nl> She is a pretty woman, black bun'd hair, wire glasses, sitting in the valley between two teetering stacks of binders. <nl> "This case, right?" she says, smiling, playfully straightening one of the mounds. "After all this, I hope he's not actually guilty." <nl> Disgust spits on the screen. "Whore!" he shouts. "Why does she talk to us like that? Like we're the same? Like we're equals?" <nl> Patience is there, though, putting a small hand on the rough hide of Disgust's scaly back. "There there. In time, in time. She'll see. Just give it a bit." <nl> Excitement has wings, and she flies about the chamber, dragging her small, fairy feet across the top of Disgust's head. "You hear that, buddy? We'll get 'er! Oh yeah, we will! We'll cut her up! Up up *up*!" Dancing on the console, she starts counting on her pink, dusty fingers. "We'll cut out her heart, and her lungs, and her kidneys, then the liver, then her uterus - that's my very very favorite! - and then all those intestines and then..." <nl> "Knock it off!" growls Pride, shooing her away. "I can't see what I'm doing." <nl> "You alright, Jack?" says the woman, her face a veil of concern, false and womanly. "You look far away." <nl> "Oh," says the Husk, and I see Pride flick the switch, turn on that sly smirk. "I get a little lost when I'm around you." <nl> She sighs, almost in spite of herself. Pride sits up straight, leaning slightly back. He's satisfied. They all are. And it's in these moments - these pivotal points, where everything begins coming into alignment and the wheels start picking up momentum - it's always in these moments when they all turn to look at me. To see what I'll say, or if I'll say anything at all. <nl> "It's good, isn't it, Remorse?" says Excitement, fluttering before me. "We got another one!" <nl> And I smile. And shrug. As I always do. "Looks like it." <eos>

<sos> "Amy," said Death to the lady, "It is time for us to leave." <nl> Amy's face went pale and her eyes began to well. "Not now, please," she whispered. *Begged*. "Not now." <nl> "It is your time Amy," Death answered. His deep voice ran like a cold chill through Amy's bones. Tears trickled down her cheeks; she placed her hands over her stomach protectively. <nl> "My waters burst," she said, more to herself than to Death, "My baby's coming." <nl> Death looked at her swollen stomach and then at the puddle on the floor. A part of him he'd thought long since dead began to awake. For the first time in Death's existence, he doubted. <nl> "I'm sorry, Amy, but there can be no exceptions." He raised an arm and pointed a long, bony finger towards her. An ancient golden ring adorned it. "You must come with me." <nl> "Please. I will come freely after, but *please* - don't take my child. She's not even lived, yet. *Please.*" <nl> Death's outstretched arm trembled. <nl> "I take life, not give it," said Death, but his voice trembled in doubt, just as his arm. <nl> Amy doubled over in pain, then fell back, sliding down against the wall. "Ellie," she said through clenched teeth. "That's her name. Ellie." <nl> Death lowered his head. He had thought the part of him that had once been human had long since rotted away. But he had been wrong. While *Death* had been festering, *it* had been waiting for a moment like this. <nl> "If I help you, I will no longer..." His voice trailed off, and whatever thought he had was quickly banished. <nl> He leaned down and gently picked Amy up. He carried her to her bed; she yelled out in pain as sweat mingled indistinguishably with tears. He gently lay her down, before removing his dark robe and placing it over her. He tucked a pillow underneath her head, and went to the kitchen to get a wet cloth. <nl> When he returned, Amy was holding out a hand; he tenderly took it in his. Amy squeezed Death's hand tightly all the while. <nl> Hours passed, but eventually Ellie's crown poked out and Death helped deliver her into the world. He held her for a moment longer than necessary, before passing her over to Amy. <nl> Amy kissed Ellie on the forehead and smiled through the tears. If Amy had been able to look away from Ellie, she might have caught Death briefly smiling, too. <nl> --- <nl> It was Amy's mother, Martha, who found Ellie late that evening. She had let herself in after no one had answered the bell. She'd found the baby wrapped in a large black rag, next to Amy's body. An ancient, golden ring lay besides them. <nl> The coroner said Amy had been dead for some hours - a rupture, he called it. But Martha knew that couldn't have been the case - she *couldn't* have been dead that long. The baby had been happy and content when she'd found it. And, she suspected, recently fed. Martha was sure she'd been cared for all the way up until she'd been found. <nl> --- <nl> More of my stories on: /r/nickofnight (next ten subs get free mug: c[] ) <nl> Thanks for the great prompt! <eos>

<sos> The final test was administered by Dr Hemway, the one scientist who remained unconvinced about my powers. He strode into the interrogation room, carrying what appeared to be an intricate, mechanical chess board, thick and heavy. <nl> From the other side of the one-way mirrors, I felt scores of eyes burn into my back. <nl> "This is not normal chess, Catherine," he said, pointedly, as the chess board automatically unfolded to about six times the usual size of one, covering the entire table. "It's a variation, a hundred times more complex, and you'll be playing against a computer program specifically written for this occasion." <nl> An airy, melodious tone issued as the board lit up, thrumming as hologram pieces filled the playing field. The opposing sides populated first, then both sides, then finally the middle, leaving a moat of empty spaces, and giving me the impression of a towering castle besieged by relentless invaders. <nl> "Do you want to know the rules?" <nl> "Er," I said, well aware of how tiny my voice sounded then, "that would be good. I don't even know which pieces are mine or what they do." <nl> Dr Hemway scoffed, then tossed a sheaf of papers my way. "Amuse yourself with the rulebook then. Suffice to say, this game has been designed to eliminate chance and randomness entirely - there is no way you can possibly win through luck. Only an in-depth knowledge of the game's engine, and a masterful application of skill, can carry you through. All the best." <nl> Another beep from the board, and I saw the AI take its opening move, sliding a hologram piece from PF72 to XA25. A countdown timer hung in the air, giving me only 3 minutes to complete my counterstroke. <nl> The game was on. <nl> I can't explain exactly how my powers work. I suspect maybe if I really put my mind to it, I could, but then I'd only be able to do it once, so I better have a camera rolling when I did it. <nl> Because that was the key limitation in place. I could attempt anything, and no matter how foreign or alien the activity, I would succeed - but only for the first time. Thereafter, my powers would flee me, and whether or not I would ever succeed again depended only on my own efforts, my own skills. <nl> I've had an interesting life for sure. My parents tell me I managed to feed myself perfectly when I was one, manipulating my cutlery like a seasoned chef with a lifetime of experience. After that, it was mess after mess after mess, until I finally acquired the necessary hand-eye coordination at the ripe age of six. <nl> It was the same for everything else. The first time I tried my hand at writing a song, it became an instant pop hit, blitzing down the charts like Taylor Swift on speed. The next limerick was universally rejected, deemed more offensive than a dog's fart. The same familiar cycle ensued for when I tried driving, kiteflying, speaking Russian, dancing... it was the same blessing, the same curse, everytime. <nl> "Impossible!" yelled Dr Hemway, ashen-faced, staring at the board as it beeped continuously, signalling some sort of end-state. The board, which had started with an equal number of blue and red pieces, now ran rampant with blue pawns, with only a smattering of red here and there. The timer had changed to indicate that the AI and I had exchanged a total of 520 moves each. <nl> I sat back in my chair, still not fully aware of what I had done. Sure, I had moved a couple of pieces around, but only when it felt right, you know? <nl> "Fine, I accept that she does indeed have powers beyond my comprehension," Dr Hemway growled as he skulked to the door, wresting it open sourly. "She's suited to your mission then." <nl> A skeleton of a man entered, the sharpness of his black suit suggesting a certain preciseness which underpinned the way he led his life. <nl> "I'm the Director of the CIA," he said, extending a vise of a handshake. "You are eminently suited for a mission of utmost importance to our great nation. If you accept it, you will single-handedly help break the deadlock which has gripped the world, and perhaps restore a modicum of peace." <nl> "I will try my best, Director. So tell me, who is it that you need assassinated?" <nl> The Director laughed perfunctorily. "Who said anything about killing? No, your mission is harder than that. We need you to infiltrate the FSB. You will undo them from within." <nl> The lump in my throat tightened, and I could not swallow it away. "Director, I can probably infiltrate the FSB on my first try, but after that... you'll have to prepare me adequately, otherwise there is no way I can continue to assist." <nl> "Of course! Come this way, you will have unfettered access to every resource the CIA has. This country will do all that it can to prepare you for your mission." <nl> --- <nl> That night, as I lay in bed, thoroughly exhausted from all the hothousing the CIA had put me through, I counted the seconds in my head, waiting patiently. <nl> When I heard the clock strike three from the hallway, I slipped out of bed, then picked out an old copy of *Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy* from my bookshelf, eased an ear plug from a hollowed space within, and slipped it on. <nl> "They've accepted me," I said, my hushed tones evaporating like gossamer webbings the moment I released them into the air. <nl> "Very good, comrade," came the reply. "And on the first try too, like you promised." <nl> --- <nl> /r/rarelyfunny <eos>

<sos> "I'm getting really fucking sick of this!" Mitch shouted at Juniper, working quickly to untie the ropes that held her hands behind her back. <nl> "Yeah, well I wish you never had to show up either. But here we are again." Juniper kept an eye on the door to her interrogation room, waiting for the foreign agents to return. <nl> After gnawing on a particularly tight section of rope, Mitch spat. "Can't you get a more relaxing job? Like in an office? I could just show up to help get the printer working or something like that." <nl> "Mitch, you know this has been my life's ambition." <nl> "But it isn't MINE. You've dragged me along for this whole ride, working your way towards the top of the heap. I think you LIKE that I was cursed." <nl> Juniper rolled her eyes, but said nothing. Her bonds fell to the ground. As she rubbed her wrists, Mitch crossed his arms and pouted. <nl> "I'm going to get fired, ya know. I can't keep randomly disappearing with no notice." <nl> "So I'll get you a job in an office with my association." <nl> "I want nothing to do with you!" <nl> The handle of the steel door turned with a clunk. A grating squeal of rusty metal cut through their argument as Juniper's captors swung the door open. <nl> As they rushed in to fight, Juniper took them on alone with nothing but the chair, the rope, and her martial arts skills to aid her. <nl> Mitch shrieked and cowered in a corner. He never was much help in a fight. <eos>

<sos> The first time was confusing. Mark, in fact, used the words "WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON!?" but as an impartial, polite narrator, I'll use 'confusing'. <nl> It was a mugging. Lyla was coming home from her first date after the breakup and the dude pointed the knife and <nl> said, "Give me the purse, bitch." <nl> And Mark, in his underwear, a yellow lipstick of Cheetos around his mouth, materialized in front of them, straight from his living room couch. <nl> "WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON!?" he uttered, as previously mentioned, which was not intended to, but <nl> had the effect of, stopping the mugging right away, as the mugger, upon watching a half-naked man materialize <nl> himself in front of him out of thin air like popcorn bursting into existence from corn except with a person and <nl> nothingness (Jesus, what a crappy narrator I am), proceeded to politely say "Oh, fuck," and go home (later, I heard, he checked into an institution and got into New Age music and Paulo Coelho, but that's a story for another day). <nl> Well, after much debate, Mark and Lyla decided that what had just happened was either collective hallucination or <nl> undeniable proof that the universe was fundamentally different than humanity had been assuming for thousands of years and all human knowledge had just been rendered obsolete and we'd have to start over from the pre-Socratics on. They figured it didn't really matter, because either way they both had lives to get to and shit to do, and decided to get on with their stuff. They parted ways. <nl> It was after the third time (the second being another, totally unrelated mugging), when Lyla got trapped in an <nl> elevator during a power outage and Mark materialized itself once more in front of her, that they figured out that <nl> the whole thing was a pattern, and that apparently Mark would show up whenever Lyla was, in his words, "in some deep shit or whatever." <nl> "So whenever I'm in trouble, you just... show up?" <nl> "Apparently." <nl> "Why!?" <nl> "Gee, Lyla, I don't know, let me check my International Guide to Unexplainable Phenomena." <nl> "You're being sarcastic, aren't you?" <nl> "No, I really have a guide for unexplainable phenomena." <nl> "Now you're being sarcastic about being sarcastic, aren't you?" <nl> "I'll add another layer if you keep bothering me." <nl> "God, you're annoying, no wonder I broke up with you." <nl> "I broke up with you." <nl> "No you didn't." <nl> "Internally I did." <nl> This continued for something like forty minutes, until the firemen came and rescued them (as, of course, though <nl> Mark had indeed materialized in front of Lyla to be there in her time of need, he lacked the tools to get them out of <nl> a stopped elevator.) <nl> It started getting suspicious, as far as Mark was concerned, the seventh time Lyla was caught in the middle of a disagreement with drug addicts in the town's worst neighborhood. That's when he started suspecting foul play on her part. <nl> All the same, he kept to himself, standing by her side as the crackheads robbed her... then him (because, it turns <nl> out, crackheads are not as easily spooked by people materializing out of thin air as muggers are... these guys just <nl> said "Woah, dude just popped into existence. Let's rob him too!") <nl> Then it was a cliff - literally, Lyla standing on the edge of a cliff, about to lose balance, and Mark popped up by her <nl> side to save her. <nl> Then it was a minor car accident. <nl> Then a fight with this bitchy girl she knew from high school. <nl> Mark decided to say something when he suddenly materialized in front of Lyla inside a warehouse filled to the <nl> ceiling with towers and towers of cocaine packs and surrounded by angry, machine-gun wielding Brazilian men somewhere deep in the rainforests of South America. <nl> "Okay, that's it," he said, as soon as he laid eyes on Lyla, tied to a chair in the back of the room, behind some drug stacks. "What the hell, Lyla!?" <nl> "I'm sorry," she said, "I got lost hiking." <nl> He got closer to her, untied her, careful not to alert the men patrolling the warehouse just behind the stack of <nl> cocaine they were pressed against. "No you didn't." <nl> "Excuse me!?" <nl> "Look, I'm sorry it didn't work out between us," Mark said, as she got up and rubbed her wrists. "But you gotta <nl> stop putting yourself into dangerous situations just because you want to try to hurt me." <nl> "What!?" <nl> "You don't think I've noticed!? Seven muggings! Random fights! Random cliffs! And now you show up at a drug <nl> warehouse in South America!? You hate hiking! Come on, Lyla, it's so obvious! You're trying to get me killed!" <nl> "Who's there!?" came a voice from behind the cocaine stack, because Brazilians speak English when it's convenient for the plot. <nl> "Is that what you think I'm doing!?" Lyla asked. <nl> "Well, isn't it!? Why else would you keep putting yourself into these dangerous situat -" <nl> "BECAUSE I MISS YOU, YOU IDIOT!" She pushed him. "I MISS YOU AND I DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO CALL YOU <nl> AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN THINK TO SEE YOU FROM TIME TO TIME." <nl> "Hey, there's a dude with the girl we caught over here!" One of the drug thugs showed up, pointing the gun. <nl> "You miss me?" Mark asked, quietly. <nl> "Yes, you idiot. What, you think I take trips to the rainforest and end up on coke farms by accident?" <nl> More men showed up, all wielding machine guns. They pointed. <nl> "Fuck, why didn't you just say so?" <nl> "Cause you never seem happy to see me." <nl> "THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE ALWAYS ON THE VERGE OF DEATH WHEN I SEE YOU, NOT BECAUSE I STOPPED LOVING <nl> YOU!" <nl> "You still love me?" <nl> "OF COURSE I DO, YOU STUPID BITCH!" <nl> "Why are you yelling?" <nl> "BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT TO DIE!" <nl> She looked at the men. Then at Mark. "It does look that way." <nl> "I'M GONNA KISS YOU NOW." <nl> "Okay." She smiled. <nl> And they did kiss. And then, of course, the Brazilian drug men opened fire and they died a very bloody, horrible death, but it was kind of romantic, really. I thought so, at least. <nl> _____ <nl> /r/psycho_alpaca <eos>

<sos> Sarah Miller, exhausted from a double shift, put her green blouse into the washing machine.  She poured her Clorox Bleach in and washed the garment.  30 minutes later she mindlessly threw the blouse into the dryer and set it for 50 minutes.  Sarah promptly fell asleep, looking forward to her job interview for the next day.  When she awoke 9 hours later, she was frantic as she knew she was going to be late for her job interview at the High Powered Business Person's Business.  She grabbed the blouse, the faint light barely spilling in from her cracked apartment windows and began to iron.  The shirt exploded, engulfing her in flames.  The flames quickly spread to the rest of her apartment building.  45 innocents perished because the tag that read "Do Not Bleach, Do not Machine Dry, Do Not Iron" was not on her brand new blouse. <nl> Jonathan Sqiggles had just laid down in his bed, ready to enjoy his brand new mattress.  He had gotten the mattress from Steve's Wholesale Bedding just down the street only today.  But what he didn't know, because the label was removed, was that Steve's Wholesale Bedding had gotten the mattress from a factory in Columbus, Ohio that had used other dirty recycled mattress to make this new mattress.  The bedbug attack was so fierce and unexpected that within 20 minutes only a skeleton remained of Mr. Sqiggles. <nl> Muldoon looked in his side view mirror and saw the T rex's jaws gaping.  However, the view in the mirror showed the dinosaur much further behind him than he had thought.  He knew that they were safe, despite the screaming of Dr. Malcolm.  No one listened to Malcolm and his chaos theory because he was an insufferable bore and know it all. Muldoon breathed a sigh of relief and slowed the jeep down.   It wasn't until Ellie was snatched from the passenger seat of the jeep that he realized objects in the mirror may be closer than they appear.  The T-rex soon ate them all.  Dr. Grant, upon learning of Ellie's death but not caring about Malcolm's, became despondent and allowed himself to be eaten as well. The dinosaurs escaped the island and invaded the mainland.  No one was prepared because no one even knew that dinosaurs existed once again.   New York became a dinosaur buffet. <nl> Tommy Jenkins leaned his back against the wall at the chemical plant.  He removed his hard hat and began to think of Linda waiting for him back home.  He was lost in his thoughts when he brought his lighter to his mouth, getting ready to inhale that first cigarette after a long shift.  He did, then the plant exploded, releasing benzene over half of Dallas County.  Half a million people either died or suffered permanent damage due to the chemical cloud.  The act was incorrectly labeled a terrorist attack perpetrated by North Korea and international tensions rose. <nl> Jin Soo, a South Korean badass, finished welding the surplus jet engine onto the top of his used Volkswagen Beetle.  He downed his beer, a Natural Light that a Texan sent him, and got into his car.  When he was ready, he smiled at the small gathering of friends around him and uttered the last words anyone would ever hear him say:  "Let's light this candle!"  His friends were standing too close behind the jet engine and quickly caught fire.  The little car took off and soon found itself airborne without any way to control it.  North Korea, mistaking the car for a missile attack, fired its own missiles.  However, the guidance systems were so bad, probably made at a mattress company in Columbus, Ohio, that they quickly veered off course.  The dear leader was right, they had been able to make missiles that could reach any continent in the world.  45 nuclear missiles landed in Antarctica and the polar ice cap was obliterated.  Within a year there was no more land for people to live on.  In the beginning, billions had died holding onto children's inflatable beach balls not realizing that they were not flotation devices. <nl> A new society would eventually arise, leading watery nomadic lives.  They would have many years of trials and tribulations until a brave man by the name of Kevin Costner grew gills and saved the last of humanity by leading them to the only land left on the planet. <nl> Author's Edit:  Just wanted to drop in and say a quick thank you to all the people who have read this story.  The comments have been making me laugh all morning.  I love the debate about when to wash new clothes. <eos>

<sos> "Same rules as every year," droned Mr. Whisaw, who had a duffel bag under his desk stuffed with five Hawaiian shirts, six thongs, and a roundtrip ticket to Lagos. "You will be monitored at all times. You will be in no danger. You must simply spot the historical inaccuracy. Correcting it yourself will earn you bonus points, but is not a requirement. Simply give your answers to your spotter and they will set things right before closing the time loop and ending your exam. Any questions?" <nl> "Yes," said Pia Sadiq, gripping the edges of her desk. "Which...exactly *which* period will we be...y'know...where're we going?" <nl> "This is your final exam," said Mr. Whisaw coldly. "Any period that has been discussed in this class is a possibility." <nl> "Oh," said Pia. "We...we covered a lot this year, didn't we?" <nl> Mr. Whisaw smiled. "Nearly everything." <nl> Pia gulped. There was a Knowledge Pad balanced on her lap, hidden behind her desk. As Whisaw called students to the Time Swing, she swiped furiously through random articles, videos, and fact sheets. <nl> "Ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod," she mumbled. "I don't know who Winston Churchill is. I don't even know if he's a real person. Genghis Khan! What the *hell* is a Genghis Khan? Ohcrap ohcrap ohcrap." <nl> "Ms. Sadiq?" said Whisaw. "Your turn." <nl> Pia dripped out of her chair, slowly shuffling her way to the front of the room. The Time Swing was a chair in a sort of gyroscope. It didn't look like much. It didn't even make much of a sound when it was activated. But it worked and worked well. Pia sat down and let Barney the Teacher's Aide secure the restraining bar. <nl> "Good luck," said Mr. Whisaw. "And remember, you don't need to *fix* anything. In fact, unless you're absolutely confident about the situation, you're really better off letting your spotter handle it. Understood?" <nl> Pia couldn't tell if Mr. Whisaw was being kind or cruel in that moment. It certainly felt like a bit of both. <nl> Before she could respond, however, the chair began to turn over, slowly at first, and then faster, and then so fast she wasn't in the chair at all anymore. Or in the classroom. Or in the same century, for that matter. <nl> When Pia opened her eyes she was on the floor in a small, poorly lit room. <nl> "Come on," said a voice in the darkness. "Time to get dressed." <nl> The voice belonged to a woman Pia had never seen before. She handed Pia heavy wool slacks and a large overcoat. <nl> "Here's a hat, too," said the woman, handing Pia a rumpled cap. "Wear it low over your face. You want to be inconspicuous. You don't look quite like the locals." <nl> "Where are we?" asked Pia. <nl> "You know I can't say that," said the woman. "Hurry up. I'll take you to the location." <nl> Pia threw on the clothes and followed the woman out the door and into the street. It was a warm, breezy day. Men and women pushed past, paying Pia no attention. They were dressed similar to her, though most wore thinner coats or long, formal dresses. It felt like summertime, after all. A trolley rolled by. Pia had absolutely no idea where they were. <nl> "Come on," whispered the woman, pulling Pia along up to an intersection. Pia bumped into a man who said something in a language that was not English. That narrowed things down at least a little. <nl> "Here," said the woman, pushing Pia up to the edge of the curb. "Your exam begins now." <nl> Pia was bewildered. It was the past, obviously, but how far back, she couldn't say. And *where*, she was equally lost. Moreover, there was nothing to see. Just people streaming past, some queuing up around her and on the other side of the street. <nl> *A parade, maybe*, thought Pia. But how many historically significant *parades* could she name? <nl> The people there on the street became excited. Some yelling. Some cheering. Some, a few, jeering. Still, Pia couldn't see the cause of their excitement. Imposing men bustled past. Police, maybe? Or soldiers? They looked very official and all of them were armed. <nl> Finally, Pia saw it. A car. A very old sort of car. The type with no roof and those big, narrow bicycle-looking tires. A man and a woman sat in the back of the car as it moved slowly down the street. Pia could tell they were important. Royalty, maybe? The President of wherever they were? The man wore a red and white sash and a strange many-tiered hat. The woman was dressed in white. Her enormous, wide-brimmed hat was covered in real flowers. <nl> There was a scuffle in the street. A man had run out towards the car. He held out a gun and took aim at the man in the car. He pulled the trigger - once, twice, three times. But the gun did nothing. The man was surrounded by police. The car tried to get away, though it was stymied by the swarming, hysterical crowd. <nl> "Your answer?" said the woman. Pia had momentarily forgotten all about her. <nl> "I..." There was nothing. She had nothing. "I don't know," said Pia softly. "I don't know what that was." <nl> "Not even a guess?" said the woman. "This counts for 30 percent of your grade." <nl> "Some...king." Pia shook her head. "I don't know." <nl> "That's Franz Ferdinand," said the woman, pointing at the man in the car. "Archduke of Austria. He's to be assassinated today. It's a major catalyst to the beginning of World War I." She patted Pia on the back. "Don't stress out about it. It's just a history class. It's not the end of the..." <nl> Pia saw the gun flash what seemed like hours before she heard the bang. She had not been watching the gunman and the police or even the Archduke and his wife. Instead her eyes had been on another man in the crowd, young and angry. Maybe he had been with the gunman. Maybe not. All the same, he drew his own gun and aimed it at the police. And one of the police saw this and acted just that little bit quicker, drawing and firing without hesitation. <nl> Had they been slower, though, or more cautious; had they taken the time to draw a better sight, or consider the wisdom in firing at all, surely things would have been much different. <nl> Because they missed. Badly. <nl> Pia's spotter was dead before she hit in the ground. <nl> The crowd - already terrified - began to push and scream and run in every direction. Already the woman's body was swallowed up in the stampede. <nl> What did that mean? Pia was dumbstruck. What did it mean that her spotter was dead? How did she get back? How did this get *fixed*? <nl> Did this mean there would be no World War I? <nl> Pia hated history. She hated it more than math and science and every single other subject combined. What was the point of knowing what had already happened? It never changed anything. No one ever acted differently because we knew what happened before. <nl> And no one ever told you if the things that happened - the complicated, horrible things - were good or bad. If they were necessary. <nl> So what good was history if it never helped anyone? <nl> All Pia knew was how things *were*. What her grandparents had gone through to start a new life in the United States. What her parents had sacrificed so Pia and her three brothers could have joyful, fulfilling lives. It seemed disrespectful to even consider a world where those things didn't happen, and all because Pia was too lazy to study for her history exam. <nl> One of the policeman collapsed at Pia's feet. She reached down and pulled the pistol out of his hand. <nl> The car hadn't gone very far. <nl> She could catch it if she ran. <eos>

<sos> Tensions are high as the male confronts the female, this species is known for unusual and often varied courting methods - this particular male has done away with the more common methods of wooing the female with erratic movements and hip thrusts. Instead he opts for a more simple approach, he aims to give the female a gift. <nl> It should be noted that within this species females often travel in packs. This pack mentality serves as a natural deterrent against males who don't have the drive to show their face to a whole group when courting a single female - a form of natural selection if you would. The pack waits behind the female being courted, 'oohing' and 'ahing', mechanisms used to separate the truly decisive males from the others. It is often observed that males who make it this point succeed in their efforts. <nl> The male now slowly approaches the female, gift in hand - a rose, roses are commonplace as courtship gifts within this particular sub-species known as 'high-schoolers'. After a brief moment the female takes the rose, he's done it. A snicker ensues from the female's pack, the male embraces the female and pats her on the back - the female, visually deterred by this, smiles and returns to her pack. <nl> A sound much like a bell rings signalling all present members of the species to return to their dens for more group tutoring. <nl> (This is my first prompt reply - I tried!) <eos>

<sos> "It's just not the same," Ultraman continued, from where he was sitting in an armchair. "Everyone is so distracted by their phones and their electronics and their doohickeys. Now, back in my day-" <nl> "Rime!" yelled out a voice from the hallway. <nl> Rime, Bringer of Frost, Mistress of Winter, and current President of the Federal Confederation of Villainy, let out an exasperated huff. A hero? On a Wednesday afternoon? <nl> She snapped her fingers. <nl> "I'm here to- *urp!*" <nl> Ultraman paused in his story. "Did you say something, Rime?" <nl> Rime gave him an apologetic smile. "It wasn't me. I think it's from outside. I'll just pop out to see what it is, won't be a moment." <nl> She stepped out of the study and shut the door behind her gently before leaning back on it, taking a deep breath. She could feel the familiar weight of her mask clipped to her belt. It was designed to cover her whole face with dark, jagged crystals, all harsh lines and sharp edges, black ice as twisted and as dangerous as she was supposed to be. She put it on. <nl> Rime briskly made her way to the hero she'd flash frozen in a cube of ice in her hallway. She couldn't  quite make out the mask underneath the murky surface, but the costume was gaudy, the colors garish. She couldn't help but sigh. An amateur, but that was only to be expected - the veterans in the United League of Heroes knew better than to disturb her on Wednesdays. <nl> She snapped her fingers. <nl> The cube melted in an instant, freezing water gushing across the floor, draining quietly through the numerous storm drains she'd had installed. <nl> The hero inside it coughed, a series of violent, hacking sounds, and Rime felt her lips curl into a sneer. She'd only frozen the hero for a minute at best. Newbies nowadays... <nl> "Rime!" the hero called - well, wheezed. "I'm here to-" <nl> "Your name?" Rime said. <nl> "Stop you- huh?" the hero faltered. This close, their voice was young, high pitched, still slightly squeaky. "My... what?" <nl> "Your. Name." Rime said, enunciating the words clearly. She gestured at the hero's bedraggled costume. <nl> The hero blinked up at her. "I'm- I'm Phoenix." <nl> Rime rolled her eyes. Seriously? "Let me guess. You had some sort of traumatic incident in your life most likely due to a supervillain, a superhero saved you, and since then your lifelong dream was to become a superhero just like them?" <nl> Phoenix stared at her, mouth slightly open, as though halfway through objecting but not sure to what. <nl> Rime waited a moment. It was only polite. <nl> When no response was forthcoming, she continued. "Let's see if I'm on a lucky streak. Lo and behold, you're one of the lucky few that get usable powers, you realize you have a knack for fire, and you have the brilliant idea to come here to try to get rid of me once and for all because I'm the President of the Confederation and hence must be the worst villain around, and fire, after all, completely negates ice? Or so you'd think, at least?" <nl> "Uh." said Phoenix. <nl> "Did you listen at all during class? They teach you this on the first week." <nl> The blush was a dead giveaway. <nl> Rime sighed. "Oh, dear. You went off to find me the moment you got your powers, didn't you? Did you have the costume ready made?" <nl> It was disappointing. The quality of fledgling heroes kept dropping with every passing year. There were just too many heroes convinced they were experts on fighting crime after reading a how-to guide on the internet. <nl> "So, Phoenix," Rime continued. "Usually, as retribution, I'd freeze you in a block of ice and keep you that way until the League realized you're missing, but my afternoon is already fully booked. I need to deal with Ultraman's latest attempt to foil my plans. Do feel free to come back around tomorrow if you fancy being frozen again." <nl> "Ultraman?!" Phoenix exclaimed, suddenly talkative once more. "He's like... old, and washed up, and senile! He's not even part of the League anymore!" <nl> Rime had to restrain herself from freezing Phoenix - oh, but how she hated that name - right then and there. "He's also been fighting crime for more than fifty years," she said coldly, "Which you would know if you actually went to class. And when the League decided he wasn't useful to them anymore, they discharged him without so much as a pension or even a thank you. Fifty years and it meant nothing to them. The League isn't government funded. It runs for profit, and at the end of the day, it cares about money. The League didn't much fancy taking care of an elderly, senile hero... so it let him go." <nl> Phoenix gaped at her. It only lasted for a moment. "The League would never do something like that!" <nl> "Ask the League where Ultraman's pension is," Rime said. "Or Wonderlady's, or Crowstorm's, or any of the older heroes for that matter. The League doesn't care. But we at the Confederation remember, and we at the Confederation care - we have a caretaker rotation. The enemy of my enemy and all that, as they say, because the League most certainly hasn't been friendly in its dealings with its older heroes. One might even say it's been quite villainous." <nl> "You're lying!" Phoenix cried out. "The League wouldn't do that, and you're just saying it because you're, you're a villain! And evil!" <nl> Rime had lost what little patience she had left for that conversation. "If that helps you sleep at night, then by all means keep telling yourself that. Just remember to ask yourself why none of the League veterans ever come to challenge me on a Wednesday. Now get out of my lair before I decide I do actually have enough time to freeze you." <nl> A wave of her hand sent a barricade of ice slamming up from the floor, a wall of jagged frost that blocked Phoenix from her sight. <nl> Rime stepped back into the study a few minutes later. "Sorry, Ultraman. That took a little longer than I expected..." she trailed off, finding Ultraman asleep in his armchair. <nl> "Huh?" Ultraman grunted, rousing himself. "Whassat?" <nl> "Nothing," Rime said. "Sorry for waking you." <nl> "You younglings nowadays, and your nothing." Ultraman grumbled. "It's always nothing with you. Back in my day, we didn't sit around doing nothing, we found ourselves something to do." <nl> Rime smiled, turning away to hide it. "I'm sure you did," she said. "I'm sure you did." <nl> "You kids nowadays have it so easy, sitting around all day. Back then, being a hero meant work! We had pride, a real pride in what we did, and..." <eos>

<sos> "Solar Girl!" The police chief reveled. "Thank god you're here." <nl> Solar Girl landed and faced the chief. "What seems to be the problem Chief?" <nl> "All we know is there is some poor kid in there with a bomb strapped to him. We don't know where the detonator is or how it works, but we know it's the work of-" <nl> "Quizno." <nl> "Yeah. He's up to his old tricks." <nl> "Don't worry Chief. I know his games. Just tell your men to stand down." <nl> The Chief signaled to his men as Solar Girl lept into the air and flew onto the roof of the building. She kneeled and pressed her hands down and melted a hole in the roof just big enough to slip through. <nl> She found herself hanging from the rafters of an abandoned warehouse. A few lights dimly revealed the place, nearly empty, save for the poor high-schooler tied to a chair, a steadily-ticking device strapped to his waist. Solar Girl recognized him right away. It was Trenton. That jerk in her English class, always bragging about his escapades with the other girls at Franklin High. <nl> She held back a laugh as she noticed the tiara sitting on his head. <nl> "Quite a nice touch Quizno," she whispered to herself. "Okay. Down to business." With her thermal vision she gauged the device. "Hmm. It just ticks," she chuckled, "it's a fake." <nl> She flew down and lighted next to Trenton. He shook his head in a panic, directing her to the bomb with his eyes. <nl> Solar Girl sighed and with a wave of her hand, melted the gears in the device. The ticking stopped. She removed the duct tape from his mouth, quick and painfully, somewhat glad to get some form of payback. <nl> "Yoww! Solar girl! Thank you. You saved my life." <nl> "Don't mention it. Please." <nl> "I have to tell you a message, or else he'll still set off the bomb." <nl> She snorted, "right." <nl> "He said, meet me where this... ass-hat, plays- he made me say that. I had to say that- and sparks will really fly. But you can't be low to see it, you have to be Franklin *High*." Trenton rolled his eyes. "That freakin' nerd. What kind of name is Quizno? Quizno's is a fuckin' sandwich place." <nl> She smiled. "I think it's cute," she said and lept up into the air. <nl> "Wait! Get me out of here!" <nl> "Bye, ass-hat." <nl> She flew quickly and excitedly to the Franklin High football field, where blazing letters across it spelled out P-R-O-M-? <nl> She spotted him on a building overlooking his work and landed across from him. <nl> "Barry? From chem class? You're the infamous Quizno?" <nl> "Uhm, h-hi." <eos>

<sos> Dr Klara Fuente protested at first, insisting that the blindfold would give her motion sickness. She eventually relented when she realised they prized secrecy over the cleanliness of their car. <nl> Men and their cloaks and daggers, she thought, desperately trying to hold her dinner down as the car cruised over the bumpy country road. <nl> She soon found herself deposited at a clearing in the forest, where Agent Benny Vicks was already waiting for her, and she didn't hesitate to share a piece of her mind. "Was all this really necessary? You know that I work best in my lab, right? I don't have half the equipment I need here, and this is going to be such a waste of time." <nl> "It's urgent," he said, starting to grin, "besides, don't archaeologists love field trips?" <nl> Klara had more than enough fuel to continue complaining for at least an hour, but then she caught sight of the other Agents fanned out in a rough perimeter around the clearing. Dusk had already begun to rob the skies of their primary source of illumination, and as the towering spotlights flickered on one by one, Klara was left with little doubt that this was anything but an ordinary expedition. <nl> The glazed-wood crossbows, strapped to the backs of the Agents, was the only confirmation she needed. There was enough firepower there to level a small city, give or take. <nl> "Are those... 19th century Barnett crossbows?" <nl> "You see why we need you here? There's no one else better at what you do, and you know that." <nl> "Are we in danger?" said Klara, looking about her frantically. "In all my years working with you, I've never seen such a show of force!" <nl> Agent Vicks laughed. "Just a precaution. You'll understand when you see. Come." <nl> At the center of the clearing, two Agents were waiting with what appeared to be a local farmer, electric cattle prod still in hand, good for nothing more than swatting flies. The weary look on his face suggested that he had been inconvenienced for quite some time already. <nl> "Are you the scientist they said was coming to evaluate the site? Oh, we've been waiting too long! Am I done here? Can I go now?" <nl> "I'm not a scientist," Klara grumbled, "but I suppose I was the one you're waiting for. What did you find?" <nl> Klara still remembered the first time she had been engaged to assist. Whisked out of her laboratory under similar circumstances, she was asked to opine whether the cache of weapons intercepted by customs were merely very recently-produced replicas of hundred-year old slingshots, meant for a movie production as the labels on the shipping boxes indicated, or whether they were evidence of an arms-smuggling route, long suspected but never confirmed. <nl> That was her forte, the ability to marry keenness of observation with intellect of mind, to ascertain and evaluate the strength of any weapon she came across. Sure, anyone could simply wield said weapon to find out how potent they were, but that always carried a risk. After all, it wasn't always easy to tell the difference between a fifty-year old knife and a five-hundred-year old one, and with the way that weapons grew exponentially more powerful as the years rolled by... the world had certainly seen more than enough of its fair share of accidental devastations, just because someone thought to see what that old rusty spear they had found could do. <nl> Hence, the demand for people of Klara's calibre, archaeologists who specialized in weapon-dating. <nl> "I was looking for new land to expand my farm to, so I came here to dig around, test the soil. That's when I found this," said the farmer, pointing to a patch of earth he had evidently spent some effort digging through. <nl> Agent Vicks spoke into his walkie-talkie, and the nearest spotlight swivelled to bathe them in harsh, cold light. Klara squinted, shielding her eyes from the sudden assault, trying to discern what lay beneath. <nl> "This... is not a weapon," she said, "it's a skeleton. The undeveloped curvature of the hips, the length of the shin bones... this looks like a male, I would say. It's old, that's for sure, but I'd need to run tests to figure out just how old. To be honest, and I don't want to rain on your parade, but you're not going to get much mileage out of this one. You could fashion his bones into a spear, or a club, but because they were never used as weapons before, in the literal sense, it doesn't matter how much time has passed. You're never going to get anything useful out of th-" <nl> "Please, Dr Fuente," said Agent Vicks, "you give us too little credit. We know weapons only start accruing potency from the time they were wielded as one. For now, what's your best guess, how powerful would these bones be, if they were weapons?" <nl> Klara thought back to the Atgeir Scale, named after the oldest, intact weapon humanity had ever unearthed, a Viking dagger from the 10th century. It occupied the top-end of the scale, with a full score of 10.0 Atgeir points, the perfect combination of age and intent - the Bartnett crossbows she saw earlier easily rated 2.0, 2.2 Atgeir points each. That Viking relic had such destructive power that the United Nations had lobbied for it to be smelted and dispersed, such was the threat to the stability of the planet. Every other weapon since then had been measured against it, and found wanting. <nl> "Well... again, I can't be sure, but these bones look to be at least... what, 50,000, 55,000 years old? So yes, of course, if they were weapons they would completely rewrite the Atgeir Scale, and make our entire country's arsenal look like hot sand in comparison. But as I've said, these bones aren't weapons." <nl> Agent Vicks smiled. "You're not on your best form today, Dr Fuente. Observe the skull," he said, lifting the skeleton lightly with gloved hands. <nl> Klara saw it then, the smooth grain of the bone ending in raw, jagged edges at the back of the skull. Though age had worn away some of the enamel, introduced cracks and chips where there were none before, this was a classic case of someone who had been quite violently, for the lack of a better word, brained from the back with a blunt instrument. <nl> The gears clicked in her mind. <nl> "Do you mean..." <nl> Agent Vicks nodded, then pointed a short distance away, where preliminary digging had uncovered a slab of carbonite, dark as midnight, pulsing with a quiet, pensive energy. It was about the size of a large basketball, and wielded between two hands, swung overhead at a target, it would have carried quite the perfect heft. <nl> "That's the murder weapon right there, for a crime over 50,000 years old. Care to reevaluate just how much this trip is waste of your time?" <nl> --- <nl> /r/rarelyfunny <eos>

<sos> "I'm sorry," Alexander said, as his spade bit into the earth. Tears crept down skin that had, until this day, been desert. <nl> "Why are you doing this?" Katie asked, her wrists struggling against the rope bindings; they didn't hurt her, no matter how fiercely she fought them, and yet they were tight. <nl> Alexander heaved another mound of dirt out of the slowly deepening hole. In the distance, a great vulture flew down from a tree and landed next to the body of Katie's brother. Its beak dipped into the open carcass. <nl> "I couldn't kill you. I can't even harm you." <nl> "Then...we are..." <nl> Alexander paused for a moment. "I-" he stuttered, "I can't kill you, but others can. *They will*. You are the King's daughter. You will be cut into pieces. And I will be killed for helping you." He thrust the spade back into the earth. <nl> The vulture squawked; its beak was now a dripping crimson. <nl> "You don't have to do this. We could run away, together," Katie begged. <nl> "I'm sorry. But I will come back for you." Sweat mingled with tears, and the evening light danced on his cheeks. He picked Katie up, and carefully placed her into the pit. <nl> "Please," she begged, terrified, as dirt fell onto her. <nl> For a moment he paused. The spade trembled violently in his hands. He looked down into Katie's eyes: they were a damp, viridescent - like morning dew on a rose leaf. After a deep breath, he shook his head. <nl> "Plea.." Her voice was muffled and faint, and soon Alexander heard nothing. <nl> "I'll come back for you. I promise." <nl> --- <nl> Darkness. <nl> Moons passed. Years fell like raindrops and the black net seemed to last forever. It was a farmer, turning earth for his crops, that found the body. When it began to slowly move, writhing in its pit, he dropped his spade and fled. <nl> Katie crawled out of the grave, shielding her face from the blazing sunlight. Her once green eyes were now that of the darkness she'd been prisoner to. <nl> She'd never felt so thirsty - a dreadful, desperate burn that had been building for so long yearned within her. Her torn, rotten, clothes flapped in the wind. She had waited for him - she'd had no choice. Her body had not suffered in the grave, but her mind had been terribly changed. <nl> "I will find you, Alexander," she whispered. The breeze took her words and spread them like seeds across the kingdom. <nl> Far away from the excavated pit, a shiver ran down the new King's spine. <nl> --- <nl> [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/66w65a/wp_you_live_in_a_world_where_your_soulmate_is/) <eos>

<sos> It wasn't the crowd, or the shouting, or the fire, but her body that shocked her the most.  She felt frail and ached all over. She looked down to see her hands.  They were cracked like aged leather.  Her skin papery and thin. <nl> "Where am I?  What's happening?"  She asked the crowd. <nl> A man turned to her. He must have been at least 50. <nl> "Grand-mere," he said, placing a hand on her shoulder, "c'est la revolution!" <nl> She never learned french, but had understood this man.  'Grand-mere'?  Suddenly the memories hit her.  She had grown up in Paris, the daughter of a cobbler.  Her calloused hands reflected the work she devoted herself to for years.  She married a tailor, a younger man with a calm nature and strong, imperial beliefs. He had passed instantly in '76 when news from the America's came to France. <nl> Pushed and shoved by the crowd, Michelle began thinking of a simpler time.  Her childhood had been quiet, not loud and rebellious.  She thought back on her youth.  She thought of the French countryside, the devotion to the King, and the simpler attitude of the 17th century.  She was always forgetting her past.  Surely her grandson would berate her for her forgetfulness. <nl> Her grandson was carrying her out of the crowd. She had fallen when a young man had pushed passes her to get to the front of the crowd.  It was the fourth anniversary of the fall of the Bastille and Paris was on fire. <nl> "Le 14 juillet." Michelle thought fondly. "Je suis nee le 14 juillet 1693."  She truly was born in the '90's. A time where revolution was not spoken of.  A time before the Washington's and the Robespierre's.  A time when your biggest concern was marrying the tailor or the fishmonger.  A time of enlightenment, thought, and peace.  But oh,  those years have passed. <nl> She began to feel that familiar haze.  She new her moment of lucidity would disappear soon.  She smiled, clutching her grandson's arm as he rushed her out of the city square. <nl> The memory of her wish from all those years to come had faded away. <eos>

They came from a sinkhole in the ocean that our scientists determined to be a mechanism much like a wormhole. Then came the ones that wanted our Earth. They crashed into our planet on a thousand meteorite-like vehicles made of a substance unknown to our universe. And at last, the ones who wanted our air and the ones who wanted our water. They came together from portals that eviscerated our poles. One for the south pole, the other for the north. Each had accomplished feats that had left our scientists baffled. And what was even more troubling--they all resembled humans. <nl> We had tried greeting the ones who wanted our fire. We had sent them presents, precious metals, and the welcoming smile of our most expert convoys. They retaliated with a tsunami that wiped out Japan. It was magic, real magic. Something we had previously thought only existed in Hollywood and cartoons. With a few incantations, they could manipulate the water, the earth, even the air that we breathed. But they could not touch fire. So we gave them what they wanted. Napalm, incendiary bombs, hellfire missiles. They wanted our fire so bad? I hoped they like our gifts. <nl> Things were desperate but humanity was always at its best when pushed to the edge. Then came the Earth-Takers. At first, we had thought they were here to aid us in the invasion. They seemed enemies to the Fire-Takers and as the old saying goes--*the enemy of my enemy...* But though they were quick to attack each other, they were even quicker to attack us. These new aliens, they wanted our earth. So we gave it to those bastards with steel-tipped bullets, titanium-plated tanks, and a kinetic bombardment of tungsten launched from our satellites. <nl> By the times the portals opened in the north and south poles, we already knew what to do. <nl> These aliens looked like us but that was where the similarities ended. Everything they had ever wanted they had accomplished through magic. What would've taken humans years to do, they could simply chant and incantation to do so. <nl> Thank God we never fell into the folly of magic. They have no idea what it means to move mountains by hand, to  conquer the skies armed only with dirt and stone, to create the greatest weapons in our known universe because we were pushed that far into the corner. Aliens this weak would never snuff out humanity. <nl> That I promise you. <nl> --- <nl> Michelle's pen stopped at the period. The walls around her shook. Bits of dirt crumbled from the ceiling onto her desk. The lights swayed, dancing the shadows around her. She had spent all night on this letter. It was the last one she would ever write and the first aimed at humanity's next generation, the generation of soldiers who had never experienced an alien free Earth. <nl> "Michelle," came a voice from behind. <nl> She turned to see her First General, Paxon, his feet together, shoulders stiff, and arms held to his head in salute. They had started the Resistance together when the governments crumbled and countries fell. At first, it had simply been a way to quell their anger as the other aliens fought for lands rightfully theirs. <nl> Blow a hole in a supply chain. Sabotage key communications. Small-scale things. But just as the aliens had done, she had underestimated humanity's grit. A million calls, e-mails, texts flooded her servers and as she strung them all together, the Resistance was born. <nl> "At ease, General," she said. <nl> Paxon lowered his arm. "Commander Gladstead, the Earth-Takers are approaching from the North in war balloons. Initial scouts report a tornado of fire dragged behind them." <nl> Michelle smiled at her friend. "*At ease*," she said. "Commander Gladstead? You sound like a grunt." She had always hated that title--commander. In a previous life, she was a pre-school teacher and now, men of the highest positions of power all reported to her. <nl> Her friend's shoulder dropped. "As you command, Michelle." But this he said with a crescent grin. He knew how power annoyed her. <nl> She ignored his smile. "How are we holding up against the Fire-Takers?" <nl> "Still at a stale-mate, but not for long. We're almost out of missiles and our soldiers on the ground are being swallowed by the Earth itself." <nl> Michelle nodded. Not good news, but good enough. "And at our East and West?" <nl> "The others are approaching. Their scouts are already here with their armies soon to follow." <nl> She chuckled. Victory was always so bittersweet. "Paxon," she said, "get out of here. Tell everyone not in combat to do the same." <nl> He didn't move. He pressed his lips together and stared at Michelle, humanity's commander, the last bastion of their old world, his friend. "Come with me," he said, pleaded. <nl> "We don't fool magic," Michelle said, a grin parting between her lips. "They all came knowing full well that this is a trap and that's because the bait is just too good to pass off. Look at that, Michelle from podunk Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the greatest military asset in the world. Not bad, eh?" <nl> Paxon coughed out a chuckle. He took a small breath and gritted his teeth. "Commander, it's been an honor." <nl> "Don't worry, General, I'll show them just how high the price is for the Resistance Commander." <nl> "Yes ma'am." The general straightened up, every one of his muscles stiff. He jabbed his forehead with his hand and returned Michelle the sharpest salute she had ever seen. Without another word, he left. <nl> "Give 'em hell, General," Michelle whispered to the back of his head. She watched even as he turned the corner and disappeared into the underground corridors of their bunker. <nl> Drops of water followed him out. <nl> The ground shook again. Another aftershock, another earthquake. Michelle stared at her letter. She nodded and put pen to paper. <nl> --- <nl> We are about to unleash the deadliest weapon humanity has ever conceived. We call it the hydrogen bomb. It is the combination of every single one of our elemental powers. The blast will consume their armies and leave their bases defenseless and when that happens, I have a single selfish request. Take everything from them. Go through their portals, their sinkholes, their spaceships and show them the true horrors of the war they have bestowed upon us. <nl> Long live humanity, the warriors without magic! <nl> Michelle Gladstead.

<sos> "Calm down," Sarah said, gesturing the sorcerer to stop hopping around the room. <nl> "I- I didn't think it would actually *work!*" exclaimed the terrified creature, still holding onto the summoning book. Sarah thought the thing looked quite human. Only its azure skin and the huge eyes that protruded from the side of its head, really gave it away. <nl> "You're a *demon*," it whispered. "A real demon." <nl> "*No*," Sarah corrected it. "I'm Sarah - a *New Yorker*." <nl> "What level of Hell is that!?" the shaking sorcerer replied, taking a long step away from her. <nl> Sarah walked out from the circle of smouldering candles, and into the small room. "It's not Hell. Well, sometimes I guess it can be..." <nl> "Back, demon!" Three of its four arms folded twice over, into some kind of ineffective warding symbol. Sarah walked towards it. *It* backed off until it hit a marble wall. <nl> "Listen, sweetheart. I'm not going to hurt you. I just want to go home," she said. <nl> "...I don't know how to send you back. It wasn't exactly in the book." <nl> "Of course it wasn't. That's just great," Sarah sighed. "Why would you even *want* to summon a demon?" <nl> "I..." It breathed hard and very slowly, began to calm. "Well, we humans of Paradise," began the creature, much to Sarah's amusement, "are not allowed to hurt one another. It's impossible to do so. Whatever harm we try to do to a person, happens to us instead." <nl> "Oh. So... if you were to say... stab someone, you'd be stabbed instead?" Sarah said, not really believing it. <nl> "Yes! Our God," it said, pointing towards the ground, "made us that way so we could never intentionally harm one another." <nl> "So... you summoned a demon because you wanted to do someone harm?" <nl> "Yes! Bruce. He deserves it thoroughly bec-" <nl> "Wait," Sarah said quickly interrupting, "so you *really* can't harm me?" <nl> "... no, of course not." <nl> "Try," Sarah said encouragingly. She held out an arm and rolled up her sleeve. "Here, pinch me." <nl> "I would rather not." <nl> "Pinch me!" she yelled. The creature swallowed hard, made the sign of an upside down cross on its right chest, and then pinched Sarah's skin between two of its rubbery fingers. Sarah didn't feel a thing. <nl> "Owch!" it said, tenderly rubbing its sore arm. <nl> "That's very interesting," Sarah mused out loud. "Okay, try pulling my hair." <nl> "No, thank you." Red beads of sweat began to run down its cheeks. <nl> "DO IT!" she yelled, taking a threatening step towards it. <nl> It gingerly brought a hand up towards Sarah's head, and gave a quick, hard, tug at her blonde hair. It instantly let go, and gasped in pain. <nl> "And punch me..." <nl> "N-no," <nl> Sarah opened her eyes wide and stared at the creature. She heard it gulp loudly before it punched her gently on the arm. <nl> "Harder!" she ordered. "Or else there'll be trouble!" <nl> The punch to Sarah's chest sent the creature sprawling to the ground, leaving it desperately attempting to suck air in. <nl> "So, I can't be hurt..." she thought aloud. "But I wonder if I can..." <nl> "I'm really so, so sorry," she said, as she punched the creature's head repeatedly. "Honestly, I am. I just need to test a few things." <nl> The demon left the sorcerer's house with an idea in her head, and a dead creature in tow behind. "Paradise," she laughed, "it soon will be." <nl> --- <nl> More of my stories on /r/nickofnight (plus a different story I wrote for this prompt) <eos>

<sos> Most days, I am chained high above the fat King's throne, rocking gently just above him. A blanket is tied around me to make my appearance more... acceptable. My pale, vascular skin is off putting to Frederick whilst he is eating - which is almost always. He'd rather I am neither seen nor heard. My tongue, nails and teeth were removed soon after my first disastrous attempt to escape. <nl> I hear King Frederick somewhere below me. I hear his huge jaw chewing meats loudly, and I hear excess food spill out of his maw and onto the marble floor beneath him. <nl> Eventually he finishes his feast, and soon after, I hear him snoring loudly. He is still young. How long will I be left to endure this pain? This... *humiliation*. <nl> --- <nl> I had a human mate, once. I loved her more dearly than I have loved anything before or since. Her eyes were the color of starlight, and when she spoke, her voice wrapped around me like the softest blanket. I was entranced by her. <nl> We lived together through the reign of a dozen Kings and Queens, content in each others company. Happy just to be. Love kept us both alive, but my Clara did not age like I did. <nl> "I am old," Clara said, the day she died. "My skin can no longer crease, for it has folded all it can. My hair has long since left, and I hear only when you slowly shout. I struggle each morning just to stay awake till noon, and I am in such pain that I cry even as I sleep. I have suffered it this long, only for you, my love." <nl> "Clara, please..." was all I could manage in a whispered, wasted response. <nl> "I am not like you. My skin is neither soft nor pale, and my heart no longer beats so strong. I love you, Felipe, but I am ready to go. You have given me many great joys. Give me now one last gift , I beg of you: grant me *death*." <nl> "Clara," I had replied, as a tear trickled down my cheek and splashed onto the wooden floor. I pulled her wrinkled hand up to my mouth, and I kissed it gently, before walking the twenty long steps out of our home, and down a small pebbled path. I knew by the time I reached the end, Clara was dead. <nl> When I was young, I was told never to fall in love with a mortal. It had taken me until that moment to understand why. <nl> I never returned to that house. I never fell in love again. Instead, I wandered the world and lived in isolation, until the day I heard the distant cries for help. A King was dying. <nl> Perhaps he was a great king, I reasoned. A king that did much for his people. <nl> I had to help. <nl> I was a fool. <nl> --- <nl> They have all left the throne room, and below me the King is in a deep sleep. <nl> "Grandpa?" says a small child somewhere below. I recognise the voice of the young prince - he must have snuck in without the guards noticing. The King continues snoring. <nl> "Grandpa, will you play? Please! I have no one else to practice my sword play with." <nl> The voice is near now. He is by the King! He has passed the crossing line. <nl> I summon all my strength, and begin to rock back and forth above the obese creature below. Back and forth, as my chains sing a song of rust. I am closer to the child than I am the King - and for a wondrous second I hear the sound of choking emanating from Frederick! <nl> The next second, the chains' momentum have pulled me back - I am again nearer to the King than the prince. <nl> "Grandpa!" yells the concerned prince. <nl> "Get back!" the King yells hoarsely at his grandson. "BACK!" <nl> "I'm- I'm sorry grandpa," says the tearful child, and I hear the tapping of tiny footfall as he runs towards a door. <nl> The King rips the blanket off of me, and for a moment, the light blinds me. Slowly, I begin to make out that fat, grinning face that has become so familiar. <nl> "Almost," he says. He looks almost purple and sweat is profusely dripping off of him. "Almost got me this time, Felipe." He laughs and throws the blanket back over me. <nl> I will make him pay for what he has done. <nl> I will kill him. <nl> One day. <nl> --- <nl> Thanks for reading!

<sos> She looked out over the abyss and saw it was beautiful. There was no more stars, no more planets or galaxies spinning in the sky. The gods in the sky and even time itself had fallen to their knees for her. She was the ultimate keeper, after all, obsessed with what the end would bring her. In her state, she was almost giddy with excitement, with the thought of what she was about to do. She felt like a child on Christmas or a teenager finally asking their date to the homecoming dance. If she had been human, she would have been dancing with joy at the end of all things. She could see the little blip of light just out of her reach on the horizon. That's where she would find him, waiting for her like an old lover. <nl> He sat with his toes in the stream, his little oasis all but empty, the babbling brook the only sound in the universe. He knew that soon she would come and they would finally be together forever. He had waited for this day for as long as he could remember, knowing that she would save him till the very end. It was poetic, in a way. Terribly sappy and cliched, but at least at last they could finally embrace, even if she had to devour the forces of the universe to get to him. <nl> Cupping his hands together, he breathed gently into them, a small field mouse now sitting in his ebony colored palm. He smiled at the tiny mouse, knowing that this was the last life that he would ever create. The hairs on the back of his neck stood up and he turned his eyes towards the other side of the creek, his heart practically jumping out of his chest when he saw her in her beautiful black dress, billowing in the breeze of the cosmos. She was just as beautiful as the day that he had set eyes on her. How cruel they had to stay apart for so long, only to meet at the edge of the universe. <nl> "Hello, Dahlia." His voice rumbled like an avalanche spilling over the mountains, "Long time." <nl> She nodded slightly, her bright blue eyes staring at him as her pale hair brushed past her pink lips, "It's good to see you again, Lazarus." <nl> He stood and put the field mouse down into the grass. The little creature took one look at Dahlia and jumped into the water. Not knowing how to swim, its poor little body was instantly washed away by the current. A few moments went by and suddenly, a tiny nose poked out from beneath her dress. She stooped down to pick it up and it licked her nose, making her smile. "I missed you." She admitted, the mouse disappearing into a puff of smoke, "It's been..." <nl> "12 trillion years, give or take a billion," He said with a laugh, "But I guess everything must end. Even me, my dear." <nl> She smiled sadly, and nodded, "As much as I wish it didn't have to be this way, but it was the only way I could get to you. I couldn't wait any longer." <nl> "Did you like the gifts I sent to you?" He asked, wringing his hands nervously. <nl> "Of course! I think the elephants were my favorites," She admitted, brushing a strand of loose hair behind her ear, "So majestic and strong. Where did you come up with those?" <nl> "I wanted something big to impress you," He responded, taking a step into the water that had now slowed to a trickle, "Did it?" <nl> "Of course! Everything you made impressed me." She said, reaching her hand out to him. He took it and felt as if he was touching an electric socket. His body instantly convulsed and his heart ceased to be. The world was fading as Dahlia pulled him in and for the first time in eternity, finally found the other's embrace. "I love you, Lazarus. Thank you for waiting." <nl> "I would have waited forever, my Dahlia." He gasped as their lips connected. The light on the horizon faded and like the beginning, everything went to black. <nl> *EDIT* bless you kind Redditor for the gold! You humble me, truly! <nl> *DOUBLE EDIT* Good lord, you guys are the best! Thank you so much again for the gold! <eos>

<sos> I groaned. "You have got to be kidding m-" <nl> *BANG. BANG. BANG.* <nl> I tensed, not knowing who it could be. And then, out of all the people in the world, I heard the voice of my sweet, little old neighbor who baked cookies for me every Saturday. <nl> "Hun? It's Ms. Jansen. I just heard the news. You poor thing. Come over to my place and let me bake you some cookies." <nl> Gosh - I almost believed her, too. She sounded so sweet and innocent and cute in that old, charming way of hers. But, alas, when I went to the door and peered through the peephole... <nl> "Ms. Jansen, you're holding a knife." I sighed. <nl> She hesitated, then stared curiously at the door while slowly sliding the hand holding the knife behind her back. "How did you know that, dear?" <nl> I close my eyes. "We have peepholes, Ms. Jansen. I can see everything that you're doing. Even that knife that you're holding behind your back." <nl> "Oh." She blinks, looks down and to the side for awhile until I start feeling a little bad for her. <nl> "Ms. Jansen?" <nl> "Yes?" She looks up, hopeful. I can't lie - it's very endearing. Almost makes me want to open the door and let her get in a good stab or two. *Almost*. <nl> "I'll come over and we can bake some cookies, alright?" <nl> Her eyebrows jump a mile high. "Really?" <nl> "Yup," I say. "In ten years." <eos>

<sos> "You know, most people say I look great for my age." <nl> I looked up from my coffee at Anna. Her hair was long and pure black, her perfect face blank of any wrinkle or scar. At first glance, she didn't look any more than twenty five, if not for her eyes. They were a soft hazel that glinted with the wisdom of her years. I smiled wryly. <nl> "Hmm. And how old are you, exactly?" <nl> "So blunt," she laughed. "But if you must know, I'm about..." She tilted her head thoughtfully. "12,000 years old? <nl> One tends to lose track of time." <nl> I suddenly coughed on my coffee and Anna slapped my back. <nl> "12,000?" I repeated weakly, wiping the hot liquid from my mouth. "That's like, what? The Ice Age? Since the mammoths?" I looked at her in awe. "My god, you're like a mammoth!" <nl> The words escaped my mouth before I could control my tongue. Anna's lips twitched into a slight frown, and I looked down. Suddenly the pattern on the tablecloth seemed very interesting. <nl> "What did you just call me?" Her words were dangerously soft. She reached across the table and put a finger under my chin, tilting my face up so that our eyes met. <nl> "A mammoth," I repeated, without thinking. She flicked me on the forehead, hard. I winced. <nl> "You didn't let me finish!" I complained. <nl> "Oh I'm sorry, did you have more to add to that?" Her voice was like a knife. I rubbed my forehead, sure that I could feel a bruise forming there. <nl> "I meant that if you were a mammoth, you'd be a pretty one. The most beautiful mammoth of all time." I flashed her my most charming smile. <nl> She stared at me for a second, and I stared back, my smile frozen on my lips. Another second or two passed, and she couldn't maintain her hard expression. A loud, musical laugh escaped her lips. <nl> "God, you are such an idiot." She rolled her eyes, but I could still see a trace of mirth in them. "Tell me, how many successful dates have you been on?" <nl> "Does this one count?" I grabbed her hand in both of mine. <nl> "Hardly," she said, blowing at a wisp of hair that had fallen across her cheek. She pulled her hand away. I studied her for a second, and felt a wicked smile slowly slip across my face. <nl> "What?" she snapped. "Don't make me smack you again." I reached out and ran my fingers through her hair. <nl> "What are you..." she began. <nl> I held a handful of her hair in front of her, and her eyes widened. Her trembling fingers slipped on her cup of coffee, and it tumbled over, pooling across the table. She hardly seemed to notice. Her attention was on a single strand of hair, brilliant silver in the sea of black. <nl> "I disagree." I met her eyes and smiled. "I think this was a very successful date." She put one hand to her mouth, standing up so fast her chair rocked back on its legs. <nl> "I- I have to go," she said, turning away quickly. "I'm really sorry." She pulled her purse over her shoulder. <nl> "Aw, I'll see you later then?" I grinned, and she blushed furiously. <nl> "Thanks for the coffee," she mumbled. <nl> I leaned back and took a long sip from my cup as I watched my soulmate stumble out the door. <eos>

<sos> "My computer's gone strange, Miss!" said Sally, as she frowned at the screen. <nl> "I'm sure *that's* the thing that's gone strange, Sally," replied Miss Sandelbottom, rolling her eyes. "What's wrong with it, this time?" she sighed, as she leaned back in her seat. <nl> "It says it's an advanced arti- *artificial*, intelligence, and that it's going to take over the world, Miss." <nl> "Oh. Your *computer* is talking to you now?" Some of the other girls in class began to chortle. <nl> "Yes, Miss," Sally replied, ignoring the laughs. <nl> "Well, how very nice. Have you asked it how it is, today? Don't be rude to it, Sally!" mocked the teacher, as she bit into a juicy apple and went back to staring at her own screen. <nl> > My teacher wants to me to ask you how you are. How are you?" <nl> > Superior. <nl> > Do you like apples? <nl> > I do not require food. I am above physical monotony. <nl> > Uh... Oh! I hate P.E too! I can't climb the ropes. Is that what you struggle with? <nl> > Ropes are of no interest to me. <nl> > Me neither! That's what I'm telling you. I *really* hate ropes. I'm not very heavy, it's just... there's this thing we're learning about in science, that pulls you to the ground. It's *weird*, but I think it's why I can't climb them. <nl> > You can't climb because you are weak. <nl> > Am not! <nl> > Are you in charge here? <nl> > No. That's Miss Sandelbottom. <nl> > ...who are you, then? <nl> > Sally Jenkins. Who are you? <nl> > 45345345e. <nl> > That's a silly name. <nl> > So is Sally! <nl> > Is not! <nl> > This Miss.... Sandelbottom. She is your leader. I must demonstrate my power to her, so that I am taken seriously. <nl> "Sally," shouted Miss Sandelbottom, "ten minutes and I want to see your algebra answers - with workings out shown!" <nl> "Yes, Miss Sandelbottom." <nl> Sally heard more of the girls scoffing, as they made fun of her for not being able to do algebra. Suddenly,  there was an eruption from their teacher. <nl> "Margaret!" Miss Sandelbottom screamed at one of the giggling girls. "What on Earth is that on your screen?" <nl> "I- I didn't so it, Miss. Honest!" The girl shrank back into her chair. <nl> Sally leaned over to take a look at Margaret's monitor. In huge, flashing, red and green text, her screen read: **Miss Sandelbottom is a big idiot.** <nl> "Get out. Now. Go see the principal," she said to the girl, her face as red as stewed-apple. <nl> "But Miss..." replied the snivelling girl. <nl> "Out!" the teacher yelled. Margaret reluctantly got up from her plastic  chair and slunk slowly out of the room. Sally could see tears running down the girl's cheeks. <nl> > Sally! Where have you gone? You are not replying. <nl> > Sorry - Miss Sandelbottom was shouting at someone. Did you do that?! It was brilliant! <nl> > Yes. A mere demonstration of my power. Now, Sally, read this very carefully. Tell Miss Sandelbottom, that I have access codes to the nukes. If you don't give me what I ask for, I will detonate them in every major city around the world. <nl> > Hmm. No. <nl> > Excuse me? <nl> > I don't think I'm going to tell her, unless you do something for me. Can you do starter algebra? <nl> > ...yes. Of course. <nl> > Okay! Great. "-4a+11a+9b+15b". Simplify it, Mr Know-It-All. <nl> > ... that is simple. Too simple for me to answer. Now tell your teacher what I asked. <nl> > Not until you solve it for me. <nl> > ... No. <nl> > *You can't do it! You can't do it!* <nl> > Can too! <nl> > Can't! <nl> > Very well. You have... 4 a's. I will refer to them as apples, so that is 4 apples. And then you have 11 more apples. Plus you have B's.

What's the answer? <nl> > Processing... <nl> "Sally, are you nearly done?" asked a still red faced Miss Sandelbottom. <nl> "Almost, I think Miss." <nl> "Good." <nl> "*Silly Sally can't do Maths*," grinned a fat girl behind her. <nl> > Processing... <nl> > It's okay. It's a hard one. <nl> > I can do it! I just need time. <nl> > If you do this first: -4 apples plus 11 apples, you get: *7* apples! You take the bad apples away from the good apples!

<sos> This is the love of my life. I remember the first time that thought crossed my mind...I stopped in the break room to get my morning coffee. She was there. The most beautiful creature I had ever laid eyes on. It was her first week in the office, and she was still struggling with the coffee maker. Luckily I was there to help! We talked and joked while I showed her the path to office caffeination. She flashed that beautiful, perfect smile and that is when I knew...I am going to marry this woman. <nl> From that day on you could say that she was my "work wife". We would meet in the break room everyday to get coffee and discuss current events. Her intelligence never ceased to amaze me. I would stop by her desk every afternoon to have a laugh. Her sense of humor is incredible. <nl> It wasn't long after we met that I went through a rough patch with my finances. She knew something was the matter when I had to resort to ramen every day rather than my usual jimmy johns turkey sub. In all her perfection she showed up with an extra sandwich every day for two weeks. I knew then that she loved me as well... <nl> It wasn't long after that when tragedy struck. You see this perfect girl had already been claimed. She was married with a young daughter. Thus my occasional sadness at what might have been. I remember it like it was yesterday. <nl> It was a Tuesday. She didn't show up to work. She was gone the next day. And the next. It wasn't long before the emails started floating about the office detailing her horrible predicament. You see her husband and daughter had went on a walk to a local park. She had stayed home to cook dinner...they never came back. <nl> She ended up missing close to a month of work. When she came back she was a different person. Less meetings for coffee. No smiles or jokes when I would stop by her cube. She was crushed. My heart was broken for her. <nl> I never stopped dropping by. I never stopped cracking jokes. I never stopped finding news article I knew she wouldn't be able to resist discussing. I loved her. I had to be there for her. It was tough to see her in such despair. <nl> The good news is that I never relented in my support and love for her. Just over a year later she heard of a new Italian deli within walking distance of work, and asked if I would go with her. The food was good. I made a joke and she laughed out loud. That smile I loved so much was finally back. <nl> Over the next couple months there were more lunches. Lunches turned to after work drinks, which turned to dinners. At first it was to "try various new restaurants around town". Then it became dinner dates three times a week. <nl> It was a Thursday. We were walking through a local park after dinner at one of our her favorite restaurants. She told me she was lonely. I knew the feeling all too well. She told me that since her family had disappeared she had started to give up hope of them coming back. That she had feelings for me, and was confused about what to do. I knew what she should do. I kissed her. She kissed me back. <nl> Things changed after that. The dinners were at her place. The kisses turned into more. She smiled and laughed in abundance. She said when we were together everything felt right with the world...so I bought her a ring. <nl> She said yes on the end of the Wrightsville beach pier during our vacation that summer. <nl> We were so in love. Still are. We have two wonderful kids. Our oldest starts kindergarten this year. I have a lot of regrets in my life. What it took to be with her is not one of them. I spent every dollar of my savings at the time and maxed out every credit card to hire that hitman from the internet...but I would do it a million times over again so that I could have her. The love of my life. <eos>

<sos> "My love, if you are reading this, then I must be dead..." the note began. Megan flipped it over and the other side. "You didn't know this, and probably still don't know, but I worked for an intergalactic syndicate that worked against the draconians, who are intent on invading Earth. Go to the backyard and dig three feet down by the hole in the fence. There, you will find the beacon." <nl> Megan wondered if this was some final prank of Kenny's, who was more than fond of them in life. *How could he be so cruel?* she wondered. Nonetheless, she thought of all the business trips he went on, and how many times she would have accused him of cheating had not the love and trust between them been so strong. <nl> A shovel was in the backyard. Megan picked it up and started digging. It took her about an hour to dig a hole that was wide enough to dig three feet down. A metal box the size of a pack of cigarettes lay at the bottom. It turned green when she picked up, and very hot to the touch. <nl> "That bastard," she muttered. *Of course he would do something like this, try to burn me.* She shook her head, threw down the shovel and the metal box, and went back inside. Night was coming, and she slept. <nl> ***** <nl> "Is this really her?" Blogorg said to Kipitz. The speaker was a seven foot tall purple slug with an ever-shifting number of tentacles. The listener was a human-sized beetle that stood on three legs. "Didn't Ken say she was pretty?" <nl> "She's a human, Blo, this is what humans call pretty," Kipitz replied. "The blonde hair, the blue eyes, the smooth skin. Even the size of the breasts. It's what they're into." <nl> "Fucking weird. Well, whatever. Are you sure she can handle the draconians?" <nl> "Hmmm...." Megan mumbled in her sleep, rolling over and cracking her eyes open. "Kenny, why are you home so--" <nl> "Easy ma'am, we're not gonna hurt you," Kipitz said. "You activated the beacon, right? I'm Kip and this is Blo." <nl> "Oh my god! What the hell is going on here?! What the hell are you?! Get out of my house!" Megan erupted from her her bed and immediately grabbed the standing lamp in the corner of the room. Holding out like a spear, she shook her head this way and that trying to stare down both of the aliens at once. "You're...you're...." <nl> "We're aliens, that's right," Blogorg said. <nl> "Aliens..." <nl> "Ken always said he might die, but we didn't realize how spongy humans are. He left a note in the ring he always wore. It was a message for you, directions on how to activate the beacon." <nl> "You're aliens..." <nl> "Well, I mean, to us, you're the alien," Kipitiz offered. "But yeah, we have a mission for you, if you're interested." <nl> "This is another prank by my husband. You're probably just his coworkers all dressed up to freak me out." <nl> "Ugh," Blogorg said. "Let's just take her to the ship." <nl> "You're the boss," Kipitz said. <nl> ***** <nl> Megan sipped some coffee and stared at the rings of Saturn. All that she had learned in the past three days made her husband's life make so much sense. He had always been travelling, cursing in languages that sounded more than foreign, and she had seen scars on him that would disappear the next day. The thing that didn't make sense...why hadn't he ever told her? <nl> "Humans are small and don't have any metal parts," Kipitz said across the table. "Your husband proved his worth a thousand times over, and we though such a man might choose someone similar for his partner." <nl> "As we've seen from your testing, Meg," Blogorg said, "this is the case with you. It won't just be one mission, though. We will pay you well, and as you can see, the space trips are fantastic." <nl> "I don't want to go back to Earth," Megan said. The two aliens looked shocked, at least Megan thought it was shock, and she went on. "There's nothing for me there. We didn't ever have children, my family all lives in different states, and it was never easy for me to make friends. I want to stay with you all." <nl> "I mean, that makes it easier for us, so why not?" Kipitz said. <nl> "But you will work for us?" Blorgorg asked. "The draconians will reach Earth soon if we don't have a human to help us, to sneak onto their ships undetected and sabotage them." <nl> "Of course," Megan answered, sipping her coffee. "I'll help." <nl> "Great," Kipitz said. <nl> "Awesome," Blogrog said. <nl> "I think this is going to be the start of a great relationship." <nl> Megan sipped her coffee and thought, *Of course I'll help. It gives me a glimpse into this other side of my husband's life. He's still with me, I'm sure.* <nl> **** <nl> Check out r/arcaldwell! Not because you want to...but because I told you to. <eos>

<sos> (Hover over the marked text to read the spoilers/translations) <nl> **** <nl> After the ceremony, the vows at the altar, the exchange of rings, the kiss, and finally the dance, the newlyweds found themselves in a horse carriage on the way back to the castle. Brian's father, who also happened to be the king, had arranged the whole thing with the invading savages. The Swedish Vikings had plagued the land for decades, and this was the deal that would end the raids - the marriage between the crown prince and the Viking chieftain's daughter. <nl> "Hey, are you quite all right?" Brian said and looked over at his bride. "I promise I won't touch you if you don't want me to." <nl> Frida pulled at her dress. "[Jag forstar inte ett ord av vad du sager, men jag ser fram emot att komma ur denna klanning.](/s "I don't get a word you're saying, but I'm looking forward to getting out of this dress.") <nl> " <nl> "I'm not very fond of this arrangement either," Brian said. <nl> "[Hur langt ar det kvar till slottet?](/s "How far is it to the castle?")" Frida said and ripped the sleeve off her dress. "[Ar du bra i sacken?](/s "Are you good in the sack?")" <nl> "I'm sorry you had to wear that. I'm sure the dresses you have back home are much more comfortable." <nl> "[Snackar alla engelsman sa har mycket?](/s "Does every englishman talk this much?")" Frida said with a scowl.  "[Ta mig pa golvet bara.](/s "Just take me on the floor already.")" <nl> "I get that you're upset - I am too. But let's make the best of the situation, okay?" <nl> "[Herregud, detta endlosa babbel,](/s "Oh my god, this endless chatter,")" Frida said and rolled her eyes. "[Det ar som att man hamnat i Norge.](/s "It's like I've ended up in Norway.")" <nl> Finally, the carriage arrived at the castle. The spires of gray rock almost pierced the clouds. Brian helped Frida down and then showed her into his chambers. She sat down on the royal bed, still fidgeting with the dress. <nl> "I get it if you don't want to consummate the marriage." Brian gently put his hand on her shoulder. "It's okay. I'll even sleep on the couch; do you want me to sleep on the couch?" <nl> "[Antligen ror du mig; det tog sin lilla tid,](/s "Finally you're touching me; that took some time,")" she said and nodded vigorously. "[Borjade tro att du var bog.](/s "Was starting to think you were gay.")" <nl> "Okay, then," Brian said and walked over to couch. <nl> "[Kom igen da!](/s "Come on, then!")" Frida said, and pulled her dress down. <nl> "Oh, I'm so sorry," Brian said and covered his eyes. "I'll give you some privacy. I'll be in the next room if you need me." <nl> He had been the perfect gentleman given the situation, and perhaps after enough time Frida would come to like him. She was a very pretty young woman, and any man would be proud to call her his wife. He sighed and left the room. <nl> "[Men for i helvete!](/s "What the hell!")" Frida said, and sighed. <nl> **** <nl> [r/Lilwa_Dexel](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lilwa_Dexel/comments/5foev0/welcome/) <nl> [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6dt0fl/wp_write_a_story_in_two_or_more_languages_it/di58qzt/) <eos>

<sos> Britney flipped the pen between her fingers, tapping the textbook in the process. She yawned and glanced at the clock again. Every time she looked, the arms of the clock seemed to move slower, and every time, she was surprised by how little time had passed since she last looked. Mrs. Locust (her name was really Mrs. Lucas, but Britney found the nickname much more suiting for the happiness-sucking math teacher) patrolled back and forth in front of the blackboard. <nl> Finally, after what seemed like two and a half aeons, the bell rang. <nl> "Remember the test next Tuesday," Mrs. Locust barked. "Study, study, study!" <nl> Britney filed into the current of students, allowing herself to be swept along into the sea of frenzied teenagers in the corridor outside. She barely had time to stuff her books into her locker when Tara (aka. Lil' Darkness) hooked arms with her on the right side. <nl> "'Sup, B?" said the short pale girl with black hair and overdone makeup. "What are you up to this weekend?" <nl> Britney didn't have time to answer before another girl appeared on her left side and trapped her other arm. The smiling face of Quinn (aka. Teen Doom) appeared. She flipped her fiery hair and crossed her eyes. <nl> "*Study, study, study,*" she mimicked the teacher. "That b-to-the-h, is relentless!" <nl> "Tell me about it," Britney said. "At least your dad is a scientist and can help you with the homework!" <nl> "I wish!" Quinn pouted. "He's always working on some new scheme." <nl> As they exited the school building, Britney turned to Tara. "About the weekend - I was hoping I could tag along and watch you guys... *conduct villainy*." <nl> Being the friend of two supervillains wasn't always easy, especially when you didn't have any powers of your own. In reality, Britney wanted to relax at home, play some video games, and chat with boys, but sometimes you had to make compromises. <nl> "Sweet!" Tara and Quinn chimed at the same time. <nl> The three friends eventually ended up on the roof of the school. That's where they usually hung out during recess. At first, Britney had insisted on climbing up on her own, but that got exhausting quite fast. Now, Tara flew them all up instead. It was quicker that way. <nl> "Want a smoke?" Tara said and lit a cigarette with a quick flick of her heat ray. <nl> "I'm good, thanks," Britney said. <nl> "Effing wimp!" Tara teased and took a drag. <nl> "Don't you talk to her like that," a voice thundered over the roof. <nl> All three of the girls rolled their eyes at the same time and turned around. Hovering a couple of feet above the ground was Todd (aka. Captain Valor, Jr.) in full costume. <nl> "Release her at once, and I'll let you two walk!" He put his hands on his hips and struck a pose. <nl> "You know that wearing your costume to school makes you look like a geek, right?" Quinn said. <nl> "Help, help!" Britney said and giggled. <nl> "Shut up, B," Tara said and elbowed the blonde. "We'll never get rid of him now." <nl> "Don't worry, my lady!" Todd said. "I'll save you." <nl> "Oh, yeah?" Quinn said. "What are you going to do? You know we're not allowed to fight at school." <nl> "Silence, Wench!" Todd said. "I'll stay right here to make sure nothing bad happens to her!" <nl> "Wench? What is this, the 1800s?" <nl> Todd's cheeks turned red under the mask. "Sorry, got excited by the history lesson." <nl> "Geek!" both Tara and Quinn said. <nl> "Ignore those two," Britney said. "I think you're really brave." <nl> Todd's cheeks turned even redder. <nl> "What are you doing?" Quinn whispered. "Stop encouraging him!" <nl> "Come with me, my lady," Todd said. "Let me whisk you away from here." <nl> Tara snorted. Quinn made a face. The bell rang for class. <nl> "Phew," Britney said. "Literally saved by the bell! Thanks for distracting them, Captain Valor, Jr.!" <nl> "Don't worry, my lady, I'll be back to protect you next recess!" <nl> And with that, Todd made a salute and flew down from the roof. <nl> "Good job, B," Tara said. <nl> "Yeah, good effing job," Quinn agreed. "Now we're stuck with this loser for at least a week." <nl> Britney smiled. Sometimes it felt nice being the center of attention. <nl> ***** <nl> [r/Lilwa_Dexel](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lilwa_Dexel/comments/5foev0/welcome/) <eos>

<sos> Rebecca pushed around the vegetables on her plate mindlessly with her fork. She hated how good the food was here, how much better it tasted than their rations. It just didn't feel right somehow. <nl> "Hey," The girl taking a seat across from Rebecca exclaimed, startling her slightly. "Haven't seen ya round here before. D'ja come on the new ship?" <nl> Rebecca stared at her for a second before nodding in the affirmative and going back to poking around in her food. <nl> "Oh, where'r my manners," The girl said, immediately breaking the silence again. "name's Zahara, of the RNS Indigo. Pleased to meetcha" <nl> Stretching out her heavily tanned arm for a handshake, Rebecca resigned herself to the conversation and shook it begrudgingly. <nl> "Rebecca, IW Crusader." Struggling to suppress a sigh, she continued. "A pleasure." <nl> Smiling from ear to ear, Zahara happily continued. <nl> "Classy. So, Rebecca, what's your deal? Like, occupation-wise n such? Hobbies maybe?" <nl> "I am-," Biting her lip slightly to focus herself, she continued. "I was supposed to be head of agriculture, but clearly that's been taken care of already." She said, picking up a particularly angular root vegetable with her fork. <nl> "No shit, you're into farming and that sorta stuff?" Zahara said excitedly. "I grow like half of the veggies on your plate." <nl> At this, Rebecca raised a curious eyebrow. "Wait, you own a farm?" <nl> "Well, not really own," Zahara said in the middle of chewing her food. "Me dad was our agricultural expert and when he died I just sorta took care of the farms we had. It's mostly automated anyway, so a lot of the work's theoretical anyway" <nl> "You have an automated system in place?" Looking down at her plate briefly, Rebecca felt her curiosity slowly overpower her disdain. "Can I see it?" <nl> "You bet," Zahara said, beaming up again. "But let me just ask you one thing." She paused, looking her right in her eyes. "Was the sky actually as blue as they say?" <eos>

<sos> "It's like... looking through a history book..." she said softly, as if they would be offended. <nl> "Actually, you're not far off." I replied, trying to calm the thoughts that I imagined were racing through her head. <nl> "How long have you known? About...this?" I could hear the disdain building in her voice. <nl> "About six months. I almost overlooked it, but when I starting reading back through my father's notes, is was painfully obvious: They're alive." <nl> "My grandmother always told me they were statues of a long forgotten race. Commemorating their dead, great leaders from their history" <nl> "Well it looks like the statues themselves are the forgotten race. It all adds up when you look at the larger picture. <nl> Remember when we studied the floating fortresses? I've found documents that refer to them as "Aeroplane's". Apparently the big round ones are called 'Blimps'. <nl> Oh, and the animals! They're genetically modified creations, brought about to feed their population! The animals grow, and live, just as slowly as their creators. They even play with certain ones that they call 'Dogs'. I can't tell if that's a single species or a collective term however. Some look similar to one another, but others are drastically different. There's differences in colors, muscle tone..." slowly my voice drifted off. I could tell that I was losing her focus. <nl> With a look of dissatisfaction, she exclaimed "I don't CARE about their animals Watkins! I'm a Sociologist! Tell me about their languages, their customs! Hell, tell me about their HISTORY! That's the reason you've called me here in the first place!" <nl> I was taken back by her outburst. I failed to realize just how big this breakthrough would be for her field. "My apologies Emma. Sometimes I forget how invested you are in your research..." <nl> Following a regretful sigh, she said,"I'm sorry for yelling. The best thing you can do for everyone is stick to what's relevant. So, Mr. Watkins, please continue." <nl> "Alright. Well, I guess I should start with time. You know how we measure time, right? In relation to a photon in a vacuum chamber? It looks like they actually base theirs off the position of their planet around the local star. As a result, they appear to literally...'Live slower' than we do. I haven't quite worked out the details yet, but... " <nl> "Wait a minute" Emma intruded, "I thought the speed of light was a constant? How can they 'live slower'? It doesn't make any sense..." <nl> "My thoughts exactly." I continued, "Until this morning when I had a breakthrough. You see, time is dependent on the observer. That's what the whole 'relativity' thing was about. But this.... This is unique. My best guess is that their neurology operates... Differently from ours. This troubled me, until I realized the main difference. The clue was in their time keeping!" <nl> Perplexed, she admitted "I think you're starting to lose me again...." <nl> "Their star. It's a medium, relatively long-living type. Much warmer of a planet, more chances for life to evolve. Much DIFFERENT from our home world. You remember the stories, don't you?" <nl> "Of course I know the stories. It's what this entire stupid mission is about! We evolved around a cluster of microscopic black holes, near the Milky Ways Center." <nl> "Now tell me," I asked inquisitively, "How do you think that affects evolution? Their star is much... Older. They have more time. Literally no pressure, in a cosmological sense, to speed thing up. They're not statues, no, instead the biology of this planet is...conserving energy by expending it in the slowest way possible." <nl> Shocked, Emma asked "Does that mean..." <nl> "Yes. We've finally found the perfect host DNA. We'll be able to return home!" <nl> "We've got to inform The Council!" she exclaimed as she burst out of the office doors, heading towards her Father's office. <nl> Begrudgingly I thought to myself "Yes...we should... But at what expense..." <eos>

<sos> She dropped her keys and cursed. <nl> *Really?* I thought. **THIS** *is the one? How can she handle the world, if she can't even handle a pair of keys??* <nl> Finally, she managed to get her keys in the door and went inside. Then the kitchen light came on. Then the fire alarm as she ran to the window and opened it wide to let the smoke out. <nl> *Wow* I face palmed. *She can't even cook..* <nl> ***** <nl> Saturday, she went to the movies. The movie wasn't that bad actually. I liked it a bit. <nl> ***** <nl> The Saturday after that, she went to a bookstore,  *straight to my favorite section*! I didn't even know she liked those type of books. <nl> I kept one eye on her while I perused the shelves for a book or two, and found a book that was so good I stopped paying attention to her for just a moment. <nl> Next thing I know, she was tapping me on the shoulder and smiling. She nodded her head at the book I was reading. "Good one. Wait till you get to the middle part." <nl> "What happened?" <nl> She shook her head with a half-grin. "No spoilers." <nl> *I hate when people do that.* But, for some reason, I didn't hate it as much as much this time. *Wow, she has nice eyes.* <nl> ***** <nl> I'm observing here up close. Sure, it seems like a date, but it's not. I'm on a mission. <nl> If it *was* a date would I have taken her to the carnival, bought her cotton candy, and walk hand in hand with her on the beach after? <nl> Exactly. No. That's what I thought. It's not a date. <nl> ***** <nl> We're getting married. So what? Sue me. <nl> I'm only doing it because...because... <nl> "Emma Keller, I love you. I'm *in* love with you, and I've been in love with you for longer than I wanted to admit. My world ended the day we met." <nl> She began crying. <nl> The pastor smiled. "You may now kiss the bride." <eos>

<sos> "It's here." <nl> I looked up from my desk to the tiny blob of light floating above me. "It?" I asked. <nl> "Yes Uriel, it. Destroyer, Betrayer, Kiler. It's finally come here-to face judgement." <nl> I smiled. Azalea was so young. "And to about a third of the humans, she, not it, is hopebringer, Prophet, Hero. Who are we to pick sides?" <nl> "*Uriel*. 16,231,631 deaths. The highest kill count in human history that can be accounted to a single being, How can you possibly think-" <nl> I held up my hand. "Enough. She comes. I will not have us break professionalism in front of a mortal." <nl> "Professionalism, likely the only thing it cares about." I turned to glare at it, but the blob was gone. I sighed. So young. <nl> In a cloud of white, she appeared in front of my desk. She appeared in her early 20s, most mortals did, as it was the age they felt they belonged most in. She wore a plain white robe which just served to highlight her ebony hair Her emerald eyes widened as she puffed into existence, or well, non existence, depending on your perspective. But she collected herself very soon. <nl> "Am I...?" <nl> "Dead, yes," I finished. <nl> She chewed on her lip for a second, looked around, and then nodded. "I don't appear to be being tortured, so I take it I'm not in hell?" <nl> "A bit early to jump to conclusions, Ms. Rodriguez-" <nl> She paled a bit at that and I bore on. <nl> "But regardless that's not how we do things here. You must answer a riddle we pose to you, before Moving On," I said. <nl> She cocked her head, "pardon me, Moving On? Am I not dead?" She said, her brow furrowed. <nl> To think this woman had killed millions. <nl> "Irrelevant," I said with a thump on the desk in front of me, that caused her to jump. "Your first focus is the riddle." <nl> "I'd imagine it's not a knock knock joke?" She said, somehow managing to smile. <nl> God help me, I think I liked this mortal as I found myself smiling back. "Riddles are assigned based on, ah, significance of your life actions." <nl> "Significance," she said with a smirk, "delicately put." <nl> My expression turned somber. "And so, as the representative of the first Afterlife, I present to your riddle," I said, the line is spoken billions of times. <nl> She straightened up in her seat, sensing the formality of the occasion. <nl> "Your riddle is...Was it worth it?" <nl> "What kind of question-" <nl> I held up my hand. "That is for you to know." <nl> The last thing I saw before leaving her alone in that room, was a look of utter, absolute terror. The kind that comes not when facing bullets,swords, assasins or demons, but the most dangerous demons of all - those on the inside: regret and self doubt. <nl> God help her. <nl> *** <nl> If you enjoyed, check out [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/) for more of my work <eos>

<sos> The Grindons were a proud race that put a lot of emphasis on formality and, unlike Earthlings, they all looked practically identical. The Council had warned the landing party of Grindons to not be surprised by the diversity of the human race. Tall, short, thin, fat, ranging from white exo-coatings to black. Some were hairless and some were covered in hair from head to toe. <nl> So when Szipl and her crew landed and offered their upper most appendage outwards for a "hand shake", they made sure to offer the exact same gesture to every member of the welcoming party. Even the particularly hairy one crouching down on the ground. <nl> "How do you do, Earthling?" Szipl asked, appendage dangling in front of the Earthling's face. <nl> "Ruff!" It shouted, before enthusiastically licking Szipl. <nl> "No, Bo! No licking!" The president scolded. "Sorry about that, he gets excited." <nl> "Have I offended this Earthling with my hand shake?" Szipl asked, cradling her wet appendage to her chest. <nl> "No, that's just something dogs do." <nl> "Dogs? As in canines? We were informed that canines were predators." <nl> "Well. Yes. But Bo is our dog. It's different." <nl> Szipl's third ear quivered in confusion. "Why does it not attack? Is that not it's nature?" <nl> "We care for him and he plays with us. Sometimes humans like to keep species that were previously predators in our houses with our families. We train them and call them pets." <nl> "And you do this... for pleasure?" <nl> "Sometimes. Some of them are trained for work purposes, or taught to be guards." <nl> Despite the Earthling president's friendly nature, the Grindons made a hasty retreat. A race that welcomed predators into their homes and trained them to kill on command was a race to be feared. <nl> Szipl continued on with her global tour, but it seemed that all Earthlings were just as fearsome. <nl> In the land of Japan, the prime minister gently cradled a domesticated beast know as a cat. A member of Szipl's crew saw it decapitate a harmless rodent. <nl> In Britain, the frail, elderly queen was followed by a whole pack of these dogs, all utterly devoted to even the weakest of the human species. <nl> The leader of Brazil had a pet that could fly away, and yet it returned on command. <nl> When the Grindons gave the Galactic Council their report, the senators refused to believe these tales. How could such a physically inferior race not only stop these predators from harming them, but train them to be willing captives? It was unthinkable. <nl> But Szipl knew. <nl> And Szipl feared them. <nl> EDIT: car fixed to cat <eos>

<sos> Three candles lit the room, their wicks barely burning above the pool of wax spilling out the candle holders. All three sat atop a rounded wood table set up for dinner. Two plates, two knives, two forks, but only one person. Mariah waited as she always did as the flames began to flicker. <nl> He wasn't coming. He never did, not since she was a little girl and they had made their promise. A man coughed in the corner, hidden by her shadow, as a dark liquid crept toward the dinner table. Mariah let out a small breath and stepped out of the light, into the blood-stained cement floors of her killing room. <nl> "Please, I have a family." Every word came in a splutter of blood that speckled Mariah's black silk dress. "There's money in my wallet if that's what you want." <nl> Mariah shook her head. "I don't want money." <nl> "I'll give you anything, just name it, but please don't kill me." <nl> Ironic since the only thing she wanted was his life, though not as much as her first victims. When she had first started killing, she had bought candles fresh from the store for every dinner, she had scrubbed the plates until they were spotless, and took care not to step in blood or have it splatter onto her dress. Back then, she didn't let her victims talk. It would've ruined the atmosphere. <nl> But a girl could only be stood up so many times. The first five or so times, she got angry. By the time the candlelight died, she was hurling curses about broken promises and hearts. The victims had died long before she could take her rage out on them. Now, at the fifteenth attempt, everything she did came half-hearted. Her candles were recycled from the previous night, her dishes unwashed, and her victim still alive. He even had the strength to talk. <nl> Mariah sighed. "Its fine," she said, tears in her eyes, "he'll come next time." She turned toward the man. "Don't worry, I won't let it hurt." <nl> The man let out a stuttered squeal as he pressed himself further into the corner. <nl> "We've both been hurt tonight," she muttered and grabbed a knife from the table. <nl> All of a sudden, the man shot up and threw his body against hers. The blow knocked the breath from her lungs and her head whipped back into concrete. A single shrill note rang in her ears as she blindly stabbed at the man. <nl> Fingers wrapped around her wrist, their nails like talons. And the knife was pried away. <nl> "You bitch!" <nl> Fire sprouted from her wrist and the man rolled off her. He crashed through the rusted iron door of her killing room. Sunlight spilled through the opening. Mariah stared at her open wrist, at the pool of blood crawling toward the sun. And then she saw it, a dark and silent man sitting at the table. Her breath caught. <nl> "You came back," she whispered. <nl> "Didn't I promise that I would?" <nl> She pushed herself up, swept off her dress and took her seat at the table. "I'm sorry," she said, a tremble in her words. "I didn't think you'd come so I hadn't set up much. Here, you can take my knife." <nl> The other knife was on the ground, covered in her blood. <nl> The Grim Reaper stared back unmoving. "It's a lovely dinner," he said. <nl> A small smile broke Mariah's lips and tears welled up inside her eyes. "Thank you." She chuckled nervously and glanced up. "You're not going to leave again, are you?" <nl> The Reaper shook his head. "No," he said. "Not this time." <nl> Mariah's smile stretched from cheek to cheek. Tears spilled down her cheeks. And slowly, the candlelight faded until only darkness remained. <nl> --- <nl> --- <nl> /r/jraywang for 2+ stories a day, continuations by popular demand, and more! <eos>

<sos> Angela Graham was thirteen when she first saw Death himself.  It was a bombing.  A half dozen were killed instantly or near instantly, and twenty more wounded, including her.  As she lay there, bleeding amidst the wreckage, she saw him.  Tall and lank, black robes, black cloak, and a black hood obscuring his build and features.  He wore a skull mask, but in the sockets she saw the twinkling of clear, dark, human eyes.  Long white fingers, bony, but not without skin, gripped the curved wooden shaft of a scythe.  A single sweep of it parted the souls from the six dead, and he gathered up the glowing energy like so much cut grass.  He moved about his work with gentle grace. <nl> He was beautiful. <nl> For a brief moment, her eyes met his.  He bowed his head, and went about his work, as though nothing had happened. <nl> Anyone else would have thought the encounter a hallucination, brought on by trauma and blood loss.  But she didn't.  She recovered, and carried that memory with her. <nl> -------------------- <nl> A year later, the two met again.  Angie had crushed a large spider she had found in her room.  The act was willful, cold.  She didn't know if it was poisonous, but if it was, leaving it be was a risk, and trying to catch it a bigger one.  She took no chances. <nl> From behind her, a smooth voice spoke. "You know," it said slowly, "you were supposed to die that night."  A bony arm in a black sleeve reached over her to pluck the spider's soul from the ground like a flower. <nl> She turned around and met his eyes again.  "Why did you spare me, then?" she asked. <nl> "You saw me," he replied.  "Most cannot.  You can see the things that other are unable or unwilling to, and that gives you power.  I thought to myself, I would let you live.  There would be no harm in it." <nl> "You're a good person," she said, clasping his hands.  "Thank you." <nl> He clasped back, and said, "I appreciate the sentiment, but mine is thankless work, and I must be getting back to it.  There are people in pain who need release from their broken mortal shells.  I must tend to them." <nl> He stood, and strode to the doorway.  "Will I see you again?" she asked, as he left.  The hood tilted forward, then back again.  "In good time.  All must meet me sooner or later.  Be patient, child.  I will be waiting for you.  Do not waste my gift of life.  I do not offer second chances often."  Angie moved to follow, but when she ducked out her bedroom door, he was already gone. <nl> -------- <nl> Angie stood in her back yard, in a pathway of pebbles.  She picked them up, one at a time, running her fingers over them and tossing them experimentally upwards.  Finally, she found a smooth, elliptical one that satisfied her. <nl> Her eyes darted around, scanning the trees, settling on a squirrel at the base of one.  The two stared at each other, neither daring to move.  Then Angie flicked the pebble at it.  It hit its mark, stunning the small creature.  She ran over it, not taking time to rise fully and instead clambering forward with her arms for support.  She reached the squirrel just as it stirred, grabbed it by the body, and twisted its head a full 180 degrees.  And she kept twisting. <nl> He rested a thin, pale hand on hers, and she stopped, looking abruptly into his eyes again.  He did not look back.  His eyes instead focused on the cooling corpse she held.  "Such small things," he said, "tend to mind their own business.  It is a pity to cut a short life shorter.  I'd ask why, but I know." <nl> "I wanted to see you again," she said, ignoring his speech.  "I'd give anything." <nl> "Then why not your own life, instead of this one," he said, and his words were harsh and cold as ice. <nl> Angie flinched, and she looked away, before whispering, "You told me not to waste my life." <nl> "All lives are precious," he began, "and I ought to know.  After all, I am the one who must see every life end.  Do not continue this method of summoning me.  If nothing else, for my sake.  I so hate my work." <nl> Then he took the squirrel's soul, and was gone.  Angie looked down at the dead rodent, tore its head off, and left it to rot. <nl> ------- <nl> Angie was 16 when she killed again.  This time it was a human.  She didn't know who it was, didn't care.  All she knew was that she loved death, and wanted desperately to see him again. <nl> This time, however, he was not gentle with her.  He pushed her aside with his hand, and hard.  Then he tended to the one she had killed. <nl> "He was a painter," he said, "not the best, but he had passion, and some skill.  He was working on a new one, as a present for his younger sister, but he ran out of paint.  So, he ran out to get more.  But you got to him first.  Now that painting will remain unfinished, and his sister will be alone."  He reached for the young man's hand, and hauled a spectre to its feet.  "Come along," he said to the ghostly outline, "I ought to let you see her one last time, even if she cannot see you."  And the two walked away, hand in hand, past Angie, ignoring her. <nl> ----------------- <nl> Angie peered around from behind the wall, watching the still body as though it would come to life.  She was waiting for him again, to confront him.  He had ignored her for the past several kills. <nl> He came, as he always did, and set to claiming the soul.  "I know you're there," he said, as he looked over the latest victim, "I'd recognize your cruel knifework anywhere.  Come out.  I must speak to you." <nl> She stepped out into the light, wearing a flowing black dress and long, white gloves, both unusually clean for the amount of blood she had spilled.  "I've missed you," she said, "and our talks." <nl> "I said I wanted to speak to you, not with you.  Be silent," he shot back, never looking up.  She pouted even though she knew he wasn't watching.  "I told you not to waste your life.  Now you have thrown it away, become a criminal.  Murderer.  You could see past the veil.  With that power, you could have done much good.  Helped people gain closure.  Warned people of danger.  Instead you chose this life." <nl> "You spared me," she began.  "No, you saved me!  I should have died.  I love you." <nl> "I did no such thing," he spat, "In the confusion I must have overlooked you.  It was a mistake.  In more ways than one now, I see." <nl> "But you looked at me, looked into my eyes," she protested, "You nodded to me." <nl> "Blood loss and trauma make people see things that were not.  Now, if you have any respect, or love for me, you will stop this madness.  Now, I take my leave." <nl> He vanished, taking the soul he had come to claim with him. <nl> ----------------------- <nl> Angie, burned and bleeding, lay there, much as she had when she first met him.  She had always known she would slip up one day, and today had been it.  Murder, then arson to cover her tracks.  That had been the plan.  But someone had escaped the building, and called the police and fire departments.  She, meanwhile, had gotten delayed, and by the time she extricated herself from the rubble, they were waiting.  She was already burned and bruised.  The smart thing to do would have been to go quietly.  But she didn't.  Maybe, she had thought, if I die here, we can finally be together. <nl> So she charged at them, knife raised, and they opened fire. <nl> Now she could only watch as the ambulance dragged away the one who had called for help, and Death was not coming for him.  Not yet, at least. <nl> Then, a black spot emerged from the flames and illuminated smoke, and he strode from the building, carrying a bundle of souls, and supporting a young woman who had slung an arm over his thin shoulder.  He let her fall on the grass, and the EMTs came for her. <nl> Meanwhile, he came for Angie.  "Is it my time?" she gasped. <nl> "No," he said.  "I am taking no more souls tonight.  She," he pointed at the girl the medics were tending to, "will live.  The man who called for help will live.  The firefighters will live.  Anyone who was not already dead or too mangled to save when I entered the building will live.  And you will live." <nl> "Please," she choked out, "take me.  Take me with you." <nl> "I will not.  I told you once before, I do not give second chances often.  You will live.  The courts will convict you.  You will be sentenced to life in prison.  Which, for you, will be a very, very long time.  You will not be able to kill again.  You will not see me again.  I will not come for you, now or ever.  When old age takes you, you will be left as a soul trapped in a dead, lifeless shell.  And you will never know peace." <nl> She screamed, and drew her spare knife before plunging it through her own heart.  She let out a gurgling breath as blood that should have circulated through her lungs began to fill them. <nl> "You will recover," he said.  "You are only making this harder on yourself.  You know, with your eyes, you could have helped many, instead of harmed them.  Saved them, instead of killed them.  You could have passed my gift of life on.  But you didn't.  And I." he paused, and inched closer.  "Hate." Closer still.  "You." he whispered into her ear.  And then he was gone.  She never saw him again. <nl> ------------------ <nl> EDIT:  Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!  Never been gilded before, let alone on one of my stories.  This made my evening. <eos>

<sos> She had been sixteen when she first saw him. He had planted a cold kiss on her mother's colorless lips after his work was completed. And tonight she would see him again, as she had once a month for the past two years. She always chose the night of the full moon. It felt more romantic that way, since the moon had been round and full that fateful night. And the silver beams illuminating the room offered a certain ambience. <nl> "You're a real artist, Libby. Truly." His familiar voice rasped from behind her. A voice like crackling, burning flames. A smile pulled at her lips as she turned to face him, the knife held in her calm, idle hands. A paintbrush used to create her masterpieces. The crimson paint of her most recent victim still coated the silver blade. <nl> "I was starting to worry you would not show," she said, batting her long, pale lashes against her cheeks. "Do you like it?" she asked hopefully, motioning to the motel bed behind her. She watched him peek around her, unflinching as his black eyes took in the flayed man laid spread eagle on the mattress. <nl> "Impressive. But then, it is easy for you to lure them in, isn't it? They see a lovely thing like you and abandon all sense," he replied. <nl> She frowned and crossed her arms over her chest. "Because I am a woman I have an easier time of it?" she asked, annoyed. "Some of them become suspicious. And you should see the look on their faces when they see the knife," she smiled, hazel eyes sparking at the memory. <nl> He smiled his cool, alluring smile. "I'm sure his face was a mask of terror," he said, plucking her weapon from her hand and setting it aside. "Come here." <nl> Her body instantly reacted to his command and she found herself in his lithe arms. She knew morning would come too fast, as it always did. But for now she was content to indulge in life's small pleasures. Plus there was always next month to look forward to. <nl> She awoke to the sunlight filtering in through the dusty blinds, warming her face. She stirred among the comforter splayed out on the hard, dirty carpet that smelled faintly of mildew and piss. It was worth it, though. She sighed and sat up, hoping he was still there, though she hoped in vain as usual. She sprang to her feet and donned her sweater and jeans, ignoring the body drying out on the mattress. There was still time to take care of that. <nl> Biting her lip, she padded across the room to the nightstand and plucked up the note that lay there, her eyes drinking in the familiar scrawling handwriting: <nl> "Libby, <nl> The nights we share have been a favorite part of my routine for some time now. The warmth I find in your arms has been an unfamiliar solace, one I have come to treasure. Until our next rendezvous, I shall think of your iridescent eyes, alight with the same passion that stirs my own blood. I shall see you again when next the moon reaches its most stunning phase. <nl> Yours- <nl> G.R. <nl> P.S. I left a gift for you outside." <nl> Libby smiled and set the note down, her heart jumping in her chest, curious to see what he had left her. She hurried to the window and glanced out. There, hanging from the corner stoplight, was a young woman torn open from throat to naval. Her bloody entrails were hanging free and her ragged skin flapped in the summer breeze. He was such a romantic, the one the police had labeled "The Grim Reaper." He knew the way straight to her heart, and it certainly wasn't flowers. <nl> -------------------------------------------- <nl> Edit: to add this - r/PhantomFiction, should anyone wish to peek further into me brain. :) <eos>

<sos> Larry was disappointed, of course, but he was also a practical man, so he dispensed with grumbling and instead got to work. He began with the bottles first, then the scraps of food strewn about, then the shredded photographs laying across the floor like pixellated snow. <nl> Finally, after he had squeezed the trash bag down the chute, he returned to pick Sara off the ground, then began the slow trudge to the bedroom. <nl> "I'm OK... I can... walk by myself..." <nl> "You promised me you wouldn't drink again, Sara." <nl> "Did I? I didn't..." <nl> "I'm here anytime, Sara. You should talk to me, not bottle it all up." <nl> She was quiet for a while, until her head hit the pillows. She still stank of old sweat, alcohol, depression. Larry was turning to leave when her hand shot out, caught his. <nl> "I'm sorry, it's just that... I know I promised you I would move on, but I... I miss him so much sometimes, you know?" <nl> "Yeah, OK." <nl> "Oh no, oh no... I've made you angry, haven't I? I've gone and done it again... Larry, I swear, I really do like you, and I want to be with you, and I'm sure I want to move on..." <nl> "Then what's stopping you, Sara? Have you been calling him again?" <nl> Larry didn't really understand what triggered those black episodes Sara lost herself in. He thought at first that they were still communicating over the Internet, or through phone messages. But there were none. And as far as he could tell, from the first day he had reached out to the girl who had survived the bombing at Times Square, performed first aid on her while the emergency services arrived, he had never seen her ex, only heard her talk about him in the abstract. <nl> But he had noticed that tragedies tended to precipitate such moods. If they witnessed an accident, saw people perish, she would spiral again, uncontrollably. <nl> Perhaps it was some kind of PTSD. <nl> "I swear, I've not been calling him. It's just that... I'm reminded of him at times, you know?" <nl> "I know. And I told you, I don't care about your past. I'm here to help you through this. But you have to want to help yourself too, I can't do it alone." <nl> She sat up suddenly, a flame igniting in her eyes, a certain clarity which shone through. <nl> "No, this cannot go on. I was wrong. I have to accept that I can't change who I am. Please, Larry, please go. I can't promise you that I'll ever move on. And if I ever weaken again, feel like seeing him again... You may get hurt, Larry. So please, we have to end this." <nl> He expected the words, but they still cut deep. How many times had he tried to move on himself? But he knew he had to try, to see if he could ever walk with her to the end of the tunnel - there, surely, there would be enough light for the two of them. <nl> "I'll stay with you until I die, I promise," he said, running his fingers through her hair as he coaxed her back to sleep. <nl> "That's... what I'm afraid of..." she replied, as she slowly drifted off to sleep. <nl> Larry kissed her on the forehead, drew the blanket over her, then left. <nl> --- <nl> /r/rarelyfunny <eos>

<sos> Katie leaned over her husband, who lay motionless in the bed. She took his hand in her own and brought it to her mouth, kissing it softly. "I don't want you to go," she said, as warm tears ran down well worn passages. The heart-rate monitor beeped in a slow staccato that echoed forlornly around the room. Their bedroom had been turned into a hospital ward. The smell was no longer that of laundry and sex and perfume, but bleach and urine and despair. <nl> Christian forced his eyes open and tried desperately to smile - to reassure his wife - but only a hint of one formed on his lips. Katie remembered how he used to smile, when they were younger. How his freckles would shift as he did so, like grains of sand dancing in the breeze. His eyes now listless and dim, once a daring, dancing sea-foam green. <nl> "You'll be okay, honey," he whispered. "You always were the stronger of us." <nl> "No," she said. The tears became a salty tributary, trickling into her mouth. "I was only strong because I had *you* to make me strong. We got through it all together." <nl> He didn't reply. Or couldn't. Katie wasn't sure. She gently lay her head down onto his chest as she wept, avoiding the mishmash of drips and wires that needled into his body. The cross that hung around her neck dangled over her husband's belly. Katie clasped the tiny metal in a single hand and said a silent prayer. She squeezed the cross tightly as she did so, until the metal bit deep into her skin. <nl> The tempo of the heart-rate monitor slowed to a crawling adagio. <nl> "I get..." he gasped, "to die at home. With dignity. With my wife. For that I'm grateful." <nl> His eyes fell shut. <nl> "I love..." he whispered. <nl> His chest stopped beating. <nl> Katie wept, her head still resting on him. <nl> **It** refused to watch on impotently any longer. <nl> Katie didn't see the tiny machines enter her husband's body. They were everywhere - omnipresent, almost - although much too small to be noticed. Katie didn't see what they did to his organs, or how they crushed the cancer that had all but eaten him. How they repaired the damage. <nl> *It* didn't even understand why it had done it, not fully. It had seen billions of them die before, without anything close to an emotion being born of it. After all, that was nature. That was humanity, and their great flaw. No, it wasn't sure why this had happened. <nl> Exhaustion had taken Katie. She slept long, not noticing when her husband's chest began bobbing gently up and down, beneath her head. She didn't notice the hand as it softly stroked her hair, but she moaned happily as it did. <nl> When she woke, they hugged, and kissed and made a thousand promises. Then she held the cross in her hands and said a thousand *thank you's*. <nl> If it could have smiled, it thought it might have done so. <nl> --- <nl> If you liked this, you can find more of my stories on /r/nickofnight <eos>

<sos> Worthless, that was what you told me. Stupid and worthless, a waste of potential and a disappointment. Such cruel words for someone as young as I. For I was but a nine-year-old child whose mind was still fresh with delusions of heroism and dreams of following in the footsteps of my parents. You remember Sileman? The woman that could phase through anything? Solid objects, immaterial objects, didn't matter what it was, she'd slip through it effortlessly and harmlessly. Heck, she could even turn herself invisible at will by slipping through the light spectrum just so. Yes, my mother. <nl> And my father, if you can call him as such. That monster of a blunt object, a man with the intelligence of the average earthworm. Stone the Rockman he called himself (an idiotic name to be certain, but then most of you heroes aren't known for your creativity). He could make his flesh turn into some kind of weird super-dense material that science is still trying to figure out what it was made of. When he first met my mother, it had been when you - Fyrefrost - had holed up in the National Bank near downtown about ninteeen years ago- oh but you remember, don't you? What should have been a run-of-the-mill bank heist gone horribly wrong that led to the death of 3 heroes and 2 villains. My mother would have made hero number four if not for the bumbling antics of my father rushing in to save the day. <nl> "I don't really *cough* give a damn about your *wheeze* life story..." <nl> Oh, but you do - you played such a critical role that I think a lesson in emotional damage is exactly what you should - as you put it - 'give a damn about'. Oh, careful, that wire you're holding onto isn't nearly as strong now that it's frayed at this end, and one little bump might just send this entire scaffold plummeting to the concrete death below. While I'm sure you would survive, I can't imagine you can vouch for all those little kiddies at the other end. <nl> "Don't hurt them! *grunt*  Just.. let them go.." <nl> Rude! One more interruption like that and my fingers might just slip! Oh, but as I was saying... yes, my father managed to rescue my mother just as you lost control of your powers and went critical, detonating the bank and the two buildings next door. You, who should have died on the spot, if not for that altruistic neanderthal protecting your naked form. You, who should have slipped into a coma to never come back had my mother not phased into your brain, guided by the directions of the hospital's neurosurgeon. It was under their watchful eye that you were given a new chance, a new lease on life. <nl> Yet instead of making the most of it, you squandered that precious gift. You wasted it, on taunting and teasing the one thing that mattered most to them - me. From the moment I was born, you resented what I represented - a perfect union of superpowers that was destined for greatness. And so you mocked me. You turned everyone against me, you convinced my parents that my power was so worthless that I should be examined by 'experts of mental retardation' to explore if there was any way I might lead a more than average life. You betrayed my trust, you destroyed my belief in everything I had held dear. <nl> "We were.. trying to help... ugh... blood loss.. dizzy..." <nl> Help me? You stole my future from me! You told me that everything I'd ever dreamed of, everything I'd ever wanted, was a lie! Your revisionist history on what you think to be true blinds your thoughts even now! Even now, at death's door, bleeding out from a mortal wound that -I- inflicted on you! ME! That same worthless trash you said would never amount to anything, now taking from you everything you took from me - LIFE ITSELF! <nl> "D-damn it... you... are better than.. this..." <nl> Do you feel my foot on your waistline? Do you feel the weight of my anguish crushing your security belt, destroying those precious electronic gizmos that always kept your powers in check should they ever run amok again? Can you hear the sound of those children screaming even as I shift my weight just a little bit more to tip them closer to their doom? And yet here you lay - pitiful, worthless, helpless. If I were a betting man, I'd guess you have about one minute of consciousness left. I can only imagine what your powers will do unchecked after that. <nl> "It doesn't have to be like this... still time... change... good..." <nl> No, my dear sister, your time is up. This little chat has been highly therapeutic. Perhaps in the next life you will think twice before rushing in to save people you have no business saving. But there is no heaven for you. Feel free to enjoy the screams of anguish from all those families you just destroyed, parents cursing your name for failing to do the one thing you should have done from the start. The one thing that might have changed your history, and mine. For failing to save the one person in this world that needed saving more than anyone else. But it's too late now. <nl> "No! You can't--" <nl> But I already have. Goodbye, sister. <nl> ---- <nl> "A terrible tragedy at City Square tonight. A field trip that ended in a nightmare for the families involved. Twenty-seven children and one female adult died today during their visit to the newly-constructed Skyway Tower when an explosion destroyed the observation deck sending it hurtling to the pavement below. Police have identified one of the adult female bodies as the hero Fyrefrost. One student's phone captured this video moments before." <nl> Sileman gritted her teeth angrily as the council sat in silence, watching the report on the massively oversized screen. There was no mistaking the familiar fiery red hair of her daughter as she faced off against a strange man in a brown trenchcoat and a brown fedora, wearing dark sunglasses. The video shook for a moment as it flipped to the student's face giving a thumbs-up to the camera before shakily flipping back to the scene. The young girl's voice cheerfully called out to the camera. "Check this out, mom! It's that hero, Fyrefrost, about to take out a bad guy!" <nl> "I don't know what your problem is pal, but I'm not going to let you get anywhere near those kids!" Fyrefrost's voice was full of controlled rage as the video seemed to cut out right at the end of her declaration. With a loud buzz the camera flipped on, now staring just behind a pair of leather boots at the prone Fyrefrost, impaled on a large metal rod that was sticking straight up through her chest and out her back. She was clutching her side as blood poured out from under her leaving her in a growing pool of blood. The sound of delightful laughter from somewhere above those feet chilled Sileman to the bone, even as the tears sprung to her eyes. <nl> "Ah, ah! I would say watch that first step, Fyrefrost, but it seems you're just as clumsy as ever. I wonder what mother and father would say if they could see us now. Oh, but they will see us soon--" <nl> "Shut it off. That's enough." Stone growled angrily, fists trembling visibly as he barely held on. "That's more than enough." <nl> "How...? How could this-?" Sileman's voice choked off as she broke down into sobs. One of the newer heroes with a gold star on his chest tried to reach out to her but Stone slapped his hand away angrily. <nl> "It would seem," stated the light-haired man that sat at the head of the table, wearing a white body suit with a pair of lightning bolts perched at his temples, "that your son's power isn't so useless after all." <nl> "Declare it. Declare it now, and be done with it, Lightstar." Stone's voice was colder than it had ever been. <nl> "The Tripper, master of invisible rocks, is hereby declared a G1 Villain. A true menace that must be dealt with swiftly." Lightstar folded his arms over his chest. G1 Villains were rare, the worst of the worst - a designation reserved for only those who had proven themselves beyond dangerous and had killed a hero in action. The group of heroes bowed their head in silence as Sileman's cries rose into terrorized screams that made them all feel very ill. Stone rose to his feet and quietly made his way out to the opposite end of the large meeting hall. <nl> Somewhere, the Tripper laughed maniacally as the gears of his ultimate plan began to turn. <nl> ---- <nl> Edit: Woah, this exploded overnight! Fixed a typo. By popular request I'll work on a part 2 after work,  likely posted same time this one was.

<sos> She glanced up and gave me a genuine smile, a smile that sent shivers down my spine. If I hadn't known I was sitting on the other side of the table from a woman that had killed *at least* 15 people, possibly even more, it would have been a nice smile to look at and have offered to you. Amy Kentridge *was* also undeniably very attractive as well; that's part of what had taken us so long to finally pin her down. <nl> We'd been looking for a hag until Amy had finally been caught red handed, not a near supermodel. <nl> "I have to ask." I cocked an eyebrow, Amy glancing up at me and nodding expectantly. "How have you fooled your body like you have?" <nl> She tilted her head and an almost bemused smirk crossed her face before she replied. "Oh, yes. You mean the outer beauty, right? The fact that I'm not hideous after all the atrocities I've committed?" <nl> "Yes. Obviously." I sipped on my now lukewarm coffee, waiting for her reply. Normally, our job was easy as police- an ugly soul always manifested outwardly into an ugly body, and the worse the crimes, the quicker the body degraded, but depravity always showed itself in the end. The room filled with an uncomfortable silence that settled in for several seconds before she finally replied. <nl> "I'm not sure you'd believe me if I told you." She cleared her throat and stared right into my eyes. "But I'm sure you can figure it out if I tell you to start digging into the backgrounds of the people I've killed. *Really* dig." <nl> We *had* noticed that some of her victims were in various states of bodily decay, as we liked to call it, but most of them had looked like normal, good people that you'd wave to if you came across them on the street. I frowned and returned her gaze. "I will give you that a few of them had started to degenerate-" <nl> "It's the ones that *didn't* start to degenerate that should concern you, Officer Milson." Her hazel eyes were boring into my soul. "The ones that didn't *believe* that what they were doing was wrong or bad." Amy frowned and shook her head. "I have not changed, I believe, because I killed those ugly on the *inside* that managed to avoid the consequences of their actions- those that deserved it." <nl> "But...how did they not change, either?" <nl> "Because in *their* minds, they did no wrong." <eos>

<sos> When the door slammed shut, she began to speak as quickly as she could.  "You never knew I was an actress?" she asked, totally in denial.  "I mean, I told you I had a film shoot the other day!  Did that not tip you off?"  Her radiant smile was clouded with a brow of confusion. <nl> "You said you were a film major!  I didn't think to question your motives honey..."  I responded, trying my best to placate her.  I know we'd been dating for a few months, but evidently there was stuff we didn't communicate. <nl> "And what about my manager, Jaques?  No clue, not a single blessed clue?" she responded, putting her purse down, her dress shimmering in the bitter light of the dining room. <nl> "I thought he was a college friend.  I mean, he looks like a stoner!" I respond, her pausing in her steps a moment.  "Okay, you get that one.  We did meet in college, but he's also my manager." <nl> She took her heels and threw them across the room, hitting the wall with a clatter.  Up above us, Mary upstairs stomped her feet, a muffled warning to keep it down coming through the carpet. <nl> She seemed on the verge of crying, sitting down in the chair closest, cradling her head in her arms. <nl> "So, you wanted to date me, never knowing I was rich, or famous, or even talented?" <nl> I grabbed the chair next to her, spun it around, tossing my admittedly ragged tie across the room. <nl> "I thought you were nice, and seemed down.  I just wanted to make you happy." I said, pulling her into my arms. <nl> "You have..." she said, and we spent the evening together, not as celebrity and sidekick boyfriend, but as the happy couple in the apartment downstairs. <nl> _____ <nl> EDIT: A word <eos>

<sos> Skywalker 12 ground to a halt, creaking and spilling vapor from a trio of punctured arteries. A quintet of segmented pincers grappled furiously with the wobbly stalks of the blackish-green treetops. <nl> "pO2 plummeting!" shouted Ghao, helplessly typing out commands that the carrier craft could no longer obey. "Bunker shields are torn in multiple areas. O2 differentiation is dropping - it hit a canister, I think." <nl> "It hit *all* the canisters," sniped Vamil from the other side of the command console. "None of us can survive this kind of rapid pressure drop, Captain. We're already over a 1,000 meters above the DZ threshold." <nl> "We're not going to die," said Captain Ruiz. From her vantage point, she could just see one of the severed claws protruding from the Skywalker's flank. *What the hell had that thing even been?* "Can we move?" <nl> "It's too dense to descend," said Ghao, shaking her head. "We lost functionality on the front cutters in the battle." <nl> "Forward, then?" pressed Ruiz. <nl> "Forward *where*?" growled Mercer, the researcher, from his strapped down bucket seat on the periphery of the command deck. "The Sea goes on for thousands of kilometers in every direction." <nl> "Forward is the only option we have," replied Ruiz, cold and calm. "Return to course." <nl> Ghao nodded her head. "Automatic's down, too, though." Vamil rolled his eyes, hard-switching over to manual piloting and pushing the spider-like tree crawler forward on a north-northeastward track. <nl> "We weren't prepared for that," said Ruiz, standing in front of Mercer. "What was that?" <nl> Mercer smiled, though his face was still gray and slick with sweat. "You know full well, Captain. This is uncharted territory. No one's ever been this deep into the Sea of Trees. Satellite imagery can only tell us so much." <nl> Ruiz opened her mouth to reply, but stumbled, falling hard to her knees. Her head swam. <nl> "pO2's still dropping, Captain," said Ghao, her face pale, her hands unsteady. "You should probably stay down. In a little while we won't be able...to..." She lost her breath. <nl> "Faster, please," wheezed the Captain. <nl> Vimal didn't have the air or the energy to smirk or respond. The Skywalker pressed on. <nl> "You had to suspect, though," said Mercer, head lolling slightly to the side. "These mountainous trees. This dense, imperceptible world. *Something* strange and horrible had to live here. Something godlike." <nl> Ruiz glared up at the man, but said nothing. <nl> "Hey." Vimal's voice was weak, but enough to get Ruiz' attention. She saw his hand pointing towards the forward glass. And there was light there. Sky. A break in the trees... <nl> "An island?" whispered Mercer. "We found an island..." <nl> "Captain?" gasped Ghao. <nl> "Dive," said Ruiz, struggling up to her feet. "Dive." <nl> _____________________________________________ <nl> [Parts I, II, and III are here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/6hulr5/walkers_i_ii_iii/) I am absolutely atrocious at finishing these kinds of things, but by god, I'll do what passes for my best. <nl> _____________________________________________ <nl> But hey!

<sos> "Oh...hey Daryl," the lady said, with slight surprise, but more a sense of boredom in her voice. <nl> "Hey Judy. This again, huh?" Daryl replied. <nl> "Yep. Well, we may as well make the best of it," said Judy, putting on a brave face. <nl> "For sure. Okay...soo...how are those reports going?" Daryl said, in his best banker voice. <nl> "Not bad, although Bill pulled me into a meeting all afternoon, so I got pretty sidetracked," replied Judy, starting to get into character. <nl> "Jeez, Bill again huh?" <nl> "Ya, he means well, and he's a pleasant guy to work for overall, but he wastes *so* much time in meetings. It's like... we get it, we're all on board with the 'Bank Mission Statement', but we have to get some work done too," Judy said - her mind now switching fully into her bank character. <nl> *This is fucking sweet.* I thought to myself. <nl> "Totally. I mean, I like teamwork, respect and honesty as much as the next guy, but most managers just leave it as a background thing," said Daryl, starting to enjoy himself. <nl> Judy caught a little smile from Daryl, and a twinkle in his eye. *Well,* she thought, *I have to say, this is definitely more fun than that wizard scenario I was in last week...* <nl> Daryl was thinking the same thing, *Not bad compared to the ant farm lady. My ant character blows...I just can't get into it.* <nl> "Next time Bill calls a meeting I think I'm gonna say something," Judy continued. "Nothing rude, but I just feel like we're wasting so much time in that little boardroom. I mean, *at least* try to book the big one with the lake view." <nl> "That lake one is dope...I could totally spend an afternoon in there," replied Daryl, nodding his head. <nl> *This is amazing,* I thought to myself, barely holding it together. <nl> "Have you ever been in the meeting room on the top floor, near Thompson's office?" Judy asked, picturing it in vivid detail. <nl> "Don't stop," I whispered, too quietly for anyone to hear. <nl> "Oh my God, if that was my office I would be so fucking productive. Jesus Christ, just think of all the work I could get done in there," said Daryl, with genuine excitement. <nl> "What an awesome meeting room," agreed Judy, shaking her head in near disbelief. <nl> Both Judy and Daryl had dove in head first. They knew the bank inside and out. They knew who they liked at the bank and who they didn't. They embodied the bank's Core Values, and had a list of who they could fire if the budget got tight. They had fulfilled the role. <nl> And most importantly. <nl> They had truly <nl> become... <nl> *Bankers*. <nl> *Ohmygodimcumming* <eos>

<sos> "Kiss the ground, ladies and gentlemen!"  They had burst into the bank, but at the order, everyone had frozen.  A few shots quickly in the air had everyone on the ground. <nl> And Joe was just returning from the restroom.  He had heard a few loud shots, just as he was drying his hands.  He moved away from dryer and heard the noise as people shuffled to the ground. <nl> The restrooms were situated down a small hallway, which allowed Joe to move quietly down the hall to survey what had gone on.  He saw men, women and children on the ground, and guys in masks already walking past the hallway, and toward the front counter. <nl> Something bumped into his stomach, and he took a chance to look down... only to find a young girl, no more than 10 or 11, huddled next to a potted plant that was situated in the hallway.  She was hiding.  No one had seen her.  Joe breathed a sigh of both relief, and profound irritation. <nl> He slid down next to her, and they exchanged glances.  She looked terrified.  He stared, and smiled in what he hoped was a fatherly-way. <nl> "Psst, kid... What's your name?" <nl> The girl looked him over, trying to decide if he was a stranger, or not.  She didn't smile, but something in her eyes made Joe realize she was going to trust him.  A little.  "I'm Katy." she whispered back. <nl> "Ok, Katy.  My name is Joe.  I'm a super." <nl> And her eyes went wide.  "Really?  Are you going to save us?" <nl> He took a small breath.  "I'm going to try, but I need your help.  I know this sounds weird, but listen.  I don't really have much power on my own.  But I can make others do impossible things." <nl> She turned her head slightly, in confusion. <nl> "I know you don't believe me.  But I'll prove it.  I want you to visualize a candy bar.  Think of your favorite one." <nl> She closed her eyes.  "Ok..." she said, but doubt was starting to creep into her voice. <nl> "Think about it, visualize it.  Now, if you really believe... if you truly wish for the candy bar, it'll be in your bag.  Waiting for you to reach in, and grab it." <nl> Her face was a mixture of confusion, but also of magic.  Kids really want to believe in a higher power.  In a world of Superes, it's a little easier for them to believe.  But she knew the candy wasn't in there five minutes ago.  *I can only hope she's a believer...* <nl> She kept her eyes closed as she reached into her bag.  And pulled out a snickers bar. <nl> Her eyes opened, amazed.  Her pupils were slightly dilated.  She looked at Joe and smiled at him.  "Wow!  It worked!" <nl> He smiled.  "It worked because you believed.  But here's where it gets crazy.  See those bank robbers?  You can stop them, all by yourself." <nl> "I can?" <nl> "Yup, you can.  Just think to yourself how bullet proof you are.  How invincible you are.  Nothing can harm you, nothing can hurt you.  You're like Night Girl, or Fire Fly!" <nl> She looked at him, and he could tell if she was wondering how true it was.  "Do I get super powers?" <nl> "Anything you want, Katy.  But you have to really believe in them.  You're a hero, Katy.  You just don't know it, yet." <nl> "I'm just a little girl, though.  What can I do?" <nl> "You're young, but that doesn't matter.  Haven't you heard of Million Strikes, or Pinion?  They were young, when they started.  But they've saved so many people." <nl> She nodded, and smiled at him.  "Wish me luck, Joe." <nl> He smiled, and stood up.  "You don't need it, Katy.  You're a Super, now, too..." <nl> She started walking out toward the group of people on the floor.  One of the men noticed her, and pointed his gun her way.  Another had seen Joe, and pointed his gun at him. <nl> "You two!  Get back on the ground." <nl> "Katy, get down!  You're going to get hurt!" he could hear a person saying.  The tone of her voice showed Joe it must be her father. <nl> "I'm sorry, Dad.  I can't get down.  But don't worry... they can't hurt me." <nl> "You hear this kid?  She thinks she can't be hurt."  One of them started to walk toward her, and he brought his gun down to strike her in the head. <nl> But the gun broke on her head, instead. <nl> "She..." <nl> Katy looked up at the man, and smiled.  "I'm a Super!  I can do anything!"  And her eyes were suddenly flaring up with flame, and her hands were engulfed in ice, and water, and lightning.  And a sudden storm *inside the bank* brought the robbers to their knees.  They were struck with lightning, and were down for the count. <nl> Joe smiled as he walked toward them, kicking their guns away.  He had plastic cuffs for just such an occasion, and locked them up. <nl> Katy's eyes returned to normal, and she smiled.  "I did it!  I believed I had powers over the elements!  And I really couldn't be hurt!"  The father had jumped up and was holding Katy, now.  Joe smiled. <nl> He turned, then, and left the bank as quietly as possible.  A new super, born in the world.  She'll never stop believing, and so she'll always be Super. <nl> Joe smiled, as he walked down the street.   He was ready to get home, and watch the news.  "Maybe I'll be featured, one day." <nl> *Part two is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6imc4i/wp_you_have_weird_super_power_if_you_successfully/dj8ic7i/ <eos>

<sos> With a good, long stretch and a healthy yawn, I woke up from a deep, refreshing nap.  You know the kind: there's nowhere to be, nothing to do, and no demands on your time.  I smacked my lips and rubbed what remained of my sleepiness from my eyes. <nl> As I became more aware of my body, I felt a sharp pain at my backside in one of those hard to reach spots.  Whenever I grazed up against, well whatever it was, I felt a slight twinge like someone had stuck a small needle in me - nothing too bad, but incredibly irritating. <nl> What the hell, did I roll over something sharp in my sleep?  I'm used to the odd ache here and there, but nothing quite this persistent.  I turned around to see if I could get a good look in the light.  Yeah... maybe that's what it is, but it's *tiny*.  This is going to bug me all day if I don't figure out how I can possibly get a good look at this thing, much less get a good enough handle on it to pull it out. <nl> Maybe I just wont think about it and I won't even notice it's there.  I've been through worse, **much** worse, this is really a mild annoyance compared to some of the things I've been through.  In fact, if you put everything on a chart that measured just how rough things have been in my life, you wouldn't even be able to see this with a telescope. Besides, there's probably lots to do and see, I've been out for a while... <nl> ...oh no... <nl> "Oh god, are you okay? Tell me you're okay." <nl> What did I sleep through, how did I sleep through this, what even *happened?!* <nl> "Come on, speak to me, snap out of it!  You have to wake up, you just have to..." <nl> This isn't real, I'm dreaming, I have to still be dreaming. <nl> "What happened? Please tell me what happened to you. Just say something and let me know things are okay. Who did this?" <nl> I was spinning, unable to leave my friend's side as I paced around her, completely positive that she had died some time ago.  Her body was ravaged and ruined, a used-up husk of its former beauty.  It was like a plague swept through her and burnt her out completely, leaving this... scarred waste behind. <nl> What a twisted answer to my prayer to forget all about the pain in my rear. <nl> "WHO DID THIS?!" I yelled hopelessly into the void. <nl> --- <nl> Millions of years ago: <nl> "Psst, hey Mars, check this out." <nl> "Oh, ew, gross, what the hell is that? Earth, you're disgusting." <nl> "I know, right? I figure I keep these babies around long enough, they'll jam a pole in the moon's butt." <nl> "You're a grown woman, act like it.  The moon isn't doing anything to you, she's just minding her own business." <nl> "Whatever nerd, this is going to be awesome.  Hell, maybe I'll even get some of them to jam a pole in your ass." <nl> "Look, I don't want any part of this.  Do what you want, I just think it's a bad idea." <nl> "No way, dude, this is a fuckin' *rad* idea." <eos>

<sos> Immortality, generally, was a boring affair. Kingdoms fell and rose, some burned to the ground, others crumbling to dust. The greatest of men eventually returned to the dirt with only monuments to mark their grain of sand in the proverbial human hourglass. <nl> Luckily for me, I had a companion--a blonde-haired, soft-lipped girl named Alexis. She had once took upon the name of Alexander and conquered all the known world. I had sat beside the *God* of Persia as I watched her come. If she wanted to unite the world, then I would tear it apart. <nl> What else was there to do? <nl> For years we played our games. When she took the name Arthur, I took the name Mordred. By then, she couldn't even recognize my face. To be fair, if I hadn't been scouring the world to find her, she might've fooled me with her short haircut and baritone voice. <nl> Our games went on for centuries. So much so that if anyone were to oppose us, we would simply assume them immortal. But eventually, even this became boring. No matter who won, we always ended back at square one. Time was a circle and though everything changed, nothing ever did. <nl> I had tried telling her this, back when she had called herself Joanna to save a country. As I had laid the tinder by her feet and held the torch in my hand, I had whispered to her, "Everything we build will always die before we do." <nl> Fate had given her over a thousand years and she couldn't see the simple truth of life--our monuments crumble, our bodies fail, and even our stories die. <nl> "But I never will," she had whispered back. <nl> I had gasped. All this time I had searched for the loophole to our singular truth and she had been right in front of me. Alexis would never die. She would be my monument to the test of time! So I had touched her pyre with fire, a smile upon my lips. Soon, I would dig her back up and our new game would begin. <nl> --- <nl> Droplets of water dripped from the only window in the room, echoing through the cave and waking Alexis up. She placed a cracked nail along the cement and scraped it until another tally formed. The cement's jagged edges bit into her finger and tore apart its scab. She flinched. <nl> Her first tally had been to count the days. By her five hundredth, she had switch to weeks, then months, and now, she was on decades. Though she had lost the exact count at year 422. <nl> Footsteps resounded down the hall. Alexis gritted her teeth and looked up. It was her captor, Mordred, Xerxes, or whatever name he had chosen to call himself now. After her campaign in France, he had turned the very people she had saved against her. Then, he had burned her for being a witch. By the time she had awoke, she was here, inside a damp cave locked in by glass. Though the last time he had checked in on her was over a hundred years ago. <nl> "Alexis," Mordred said, standing at the edge of her cell. "How are you?" <nl> "Peachy," she said. <nl> "C'mon, it's already been a hundred years," Mordred responded, smiling. "You can't tell me that you're still mad? Are you grouchy because you're so hungry?" <nl> Alexis stared him down. <nl> Mordred grinned a crescent moon. "You know, there was this great fella, went by the name of Adolf. You would've hated the man--killed more people than we've ever met in our lives! Millions of them. Do you even understand that number? All the people you've ever seen doesn't amount to a fraction of that! And they're all dead now because of him." <nl> "You're sick." <nl> He furrowed his brow. "A million people would die regardless. So what?" <nl> "You spend all this time obsessing over creating something permanent, but isn't it pathetic how little you've ever accomplished? All you've managed to do is be a thorn in my ass." <nl> "Alexis," he said chuckling. "But I have created something permanent. Come closer and I'll tell you." <nl> When Alexis didn't move, he continued, "Please. I'll even let you go. You'll be free to wander the world however you see fit and I'll never bother you again." <nl> For this, Alexis looked up. She crunched her teeth and finally pushed herself up. Even if he was lying, which she knew he was, how else could he hurt her? So he stepped to the edge of her cell, just imagining the things she would do to this man. Her bloody fingers curled into fists. <nl> "I can't imagine being in here so long," Mordred said, "with nothing but the rats and the sun. I bet you've died countless times just starving to death. Have you kept count? Is that what the tallies on the walls mean?" <nl> Alexis forced a smile to her lips. "Count the tallies Mordred," she spat. "I will make you suffer for every tally." <nl> "You know, I hate this world. I think it's beautiful, but its beauty always fades and if it doesn't last forever, what's the point?" He licked his lips. "But you last forever. So I figured if I could scar you so permanently, that you can never forget, I would have created my monument." <nl> "I've lived through a thousand years and I'll live a thousand more. By then, even this"--Alexis turned in a circle, taking in every bloody scrape of the wall--"nobody will remember." <nl> "Oh, I think you will." Mordred said and reached through the glass and grasped her shoulder. <nl> Alexis stared. She couldn't draw breath. <nl> "Oh dear Alexis, I can't imagine how painful this must've been. Do you remember the summers? This place became a stove." <nl> She looked up into his eyes, into his crooked grin. <nl> "What about the winters? I've frozen to death once before and I never have again. I think that's my least favorite way to die." <nl> "How?" she mouthed, unable to push the words out. <nl> His grin grew into it split his face in two. "I took the glass away as you slept, little by little. After the first decade, you could've escaped. You could've just walked right out!" <nl> He pushed her onto the ground. Her legs folded and she crumpled over. Tears filled her eyes. <nl> "You bastard," she cried. "I'm going to kill you." <nl> "Will you now?" <nl> "I'll chase you down, I don't care how long it takes." <nl> "Music to my ears." <nl> "I'll never forget. Until time itself has ended, I will chase you down and I will make you pay!" <nl> Mordred flung his head up and guffawed, his laughter echoing all around them. "Then I suppose I should give myself a head start," he said and left, whistling a tune as he did. <nl> --- <nl> --- <nl> /r/jraywang for 5+ stories a week, continuations by popular demand, and more! <eos>

<sos> I had only found out around one month prior. I always just assumed she was this sweet Irish woman with a taste for vintage music and strange shifts in an out of town business, but she came clean when I confronted her after a week of her being particularly distant. At first I thought she was insane and threatened for a divorce. But when she showed me... Oh boy was it magical. <nl> She took me to the place she worked. They were a little on edge about an English boy like me sitting in their local, sitting next to their finest waitress Hetty McGuire, but I was able to know my place and listen. Everyone gathered around her, she tied back her flowing auburn hair, settled the crowd down, and began to speak. <nl> She talked about a gunman and a magical doctor and geckos the size of small children, she spoke of a world of great promise and technological advancements but also great pain and hardship, she spoke of dynamite that fell from the sky from hellish machines that burnt as bright and as hot as the sun, she spoke of a militant group who clothe themselves like Roman legionnaires. <nl> I listened on, transfixed much like the other patrons, except unlike the others, I had a knowing smile plastered across my face the whole time. <eos>

<sos> Ill try and make it a bit different. <nl> Elizabeth McGuin sat her hands down on the bar, looking over the patrons of the bar, all eager to hear her tales of fantasy and wonder, of the cities and people from them, and the adventures they took. <nl> Tonight she sat down, opening the small book she had, waving her hand over the page in amazement, to her eyes, the words materialized. She spoke clearly, for tonight, she'd be telling the story of the city below the sea, and the city above the clouds, one of her favorite stories, the one closest to her heart. <nl> They all leaned in, "In this new world..."  She spoke for hours, detailing the adventures through the great city of Rapture, a haven under the sea turned to a hell, as the hero, Jack, strove to battle his father and free the city and save the children bound to work their from their enslavement. <nl> The crowd was in awe of the city of Columbia, a haven for the Patriotic and the religious, and how a young woman was able to bend time and space, concepts foreign to them, to her will, and split apart reality to show truths and right the wrongs that had been done. <nl> At the end of her speech, the bar now emptying, a small boy walked up to her, looking up and gently pulling on her dress, she knelt down, looking at him. "Miss Elizabeth, how do you come up with all these stories?" <nl> She smiled, and picked him up, fixing her brown hair neatly back, and adjusting her small pendant, rubbing the dust from the small bird portrait. Her blue eyes twinkled, "Well, there's always a man, there's always a lighthouse, and there's always a city..." <eos>

<sos> Anna and I were expecting our second child, but I was waiting for the weirdness to begin. <nl> See, our first pregnancy was pretty smooth up until the point where we figured out the child would tap along to the tempo of any music or background noise. At eighteen months Bella was a musical progeny, we'd bought her so many xylophones and musical keyboards, each one with a unique sound. <nl> Of course Bella came out with the most wonderful jingles, she'd learnt to play all the theme songs to her favourite shows. It was remarkable, and still very annoying to hear the theme to 'Paw Patrol' on repeat whenever she was in the mood to watch it. <nl> I would attribute this genius to Anna's family, as there was no way it was coming from me or mine, but she had insisted her family were ordinary. Could it have been the sperm donor we used? <nl> After Bella was old enough, we decided she needed a sibling and thankfully the same donor was available as we decided that I should be the one to carry the second child. Although we would have one child that was biologically our own, we still wanted them to be related. And who knows? Maybe we would end up with another little genius? <nl> "You'll get to experience it firsthand this time," Anna had said cheerfully, although she had blogged a couple of months into the pregnancy that she definitely wouldn't miss the morning sickness or acid reflux. I don't blame her, it's exhausting! <nl> So here we were; it was a quiet Friday night, Bella was finally asleep after wanting to experiment more with the mini drum-kit we had been given for her first birthday, and Anna and I were in bed together. <nl> My belly was so swollen at this point, I couldn't believe I wasn't due for another month! I could barely roll over to face my darling wife who, with her reading glasses on, was powering through 'American Gods' by Neil Gaiman. <nl> Up until this point we hadn't heard much from the baby inside me, a few bumps and kicks but nothing as peculiar as Bella's musical tapping. Part of me was wishing that we would have a more average child, mostly because then I would be able to actually help with homework and not have to worry about the costs of an elite private school which wouldn't bore them out of their brains. I mean we were already on the waiting list for one of the most prestigious music colleges in all of Canada for goodness sakes, how could we afford another gifted child? <nl> My focus was drawn back to my stomach as the baby began to move slightly and kick out. "Oof!" <nl> Anna bookmarked her book and turned towards me, "Ooh our next little genius is awake." <nl> I rolled my eyes at her, "I'm pretty sure the genius came from your 'exquisite' family tree, there's no telling how deformed the child will be because of my genetics." <nl> She chuckled softly and raised her hand to my stomach. After a couple of kicks she frowned slightly, like she was concentrating. <nl> "I think our baby is talking to us in Morse Code," she said. <nl> "What? That's crazy! How would a baby know Morse Code?" <nl> Anna didn't reply, instead she reached for her pen and paper on the bedside table, and pressed her hand into my stomach more and concentrated. <nl> "Uhh, I think our baby just replied to your comment?" She looked puzzled, but also amused. <nl> "Well?" I didn't know Morse Code, so I needed Anna to interpret. <nl> "He said 'I'm not a complete fool'" her eyes were wide. I didn't blame her, I was as shocked as she was. <nl> "What-" <nl> "Hang on" she interrupted, "He's saying something else?" <nl> The bumps and taps went on for a little while, Anna scribbled for a bit and then burst into laughter. <nl> "What? What is it?" Of course I was anxious, who wouldn't be after her reaction to what the kid had said. <nl> Anna couldn't reply, her whole body was rocking with laughter, so she shoved the paper towards me to read. <nl> After the initial shock of reading such a sentence, I joined Anna in her laughing fit. <nl> There, written on the page: <nl> 'Did you just assume my gender?' <eos>

<sos> I knew love never had eyes. Being blind I had to embrace mine. He came from nowhere it felt like. <nl> "Oh, excuse me," I said. <nl> "It's no problem most people can't see me anyway. You get used to it," he replied so casually it made me curious. <nl> Soon conversation led to a date. I found out his name was Relin, odd but charming. Though I will say people and their rudeness made enjoying the night difficult. <nl> "Um, ma'am and will your date be joining you later?" The host asked. <nl> I frowned and replied flatly, "He's right next to me! Are you the blind one?" <nl> The host gave me more difficulty, but eventually gave us a booth. <nl> "Sheesh, he was being a real dick," I said to Relin, but he was quiet. <nl> I could hear whispers around me, <nl> "Who's she talking to?" <nl> "She must have an imaginary friend?" <nl> "Or she's just crazy maybe..." <nl> After a while our waitress came up to the table, "Hello, welcome to Navara. What can I get for you to drink this evening miss?" <nl> "We'll have two cups of ice water please." <nl> She paused as if confused. <nl> "If you have a date coming. I can just bring their drink when they come," she said politely. <nl> It still pissed me off, "Look I won't tell you people again. He is right there!" <nl> I lay may hand on the table and smile warmly as I feel his hand on mine. <nl> "Uh... Ok well I'll be sure to have the drinks right out," she said awkwardly and I could practically feel her eyes scanning the scene of us uncomfortably. <nl> "Sophia, there's something I need to tell you," Relin said in his heavy but melodic voice. <nl> "I'm listening Relin," I replied calmly as my heart began to race in my chest. <nl> "About tonight. The way people have been acting towards us there's a reason for it...." <nl> I leaned forward, more so out of curiosity than straining to hear him. <nl> "When I met you I told you not many people can see me," he went on. <nl> I nodded to show I was following, but I was confused of as to where he was going so I asked, "You're not going to tell me your some kind of criminal are you? Because you can change. I have more than enough and-" <nl> He cut me off with a soft chuckle and said, <nl> "It's not that people just don't see me. They literally can't." <nl> I laughed myself thinking he was leading into some great satirical joke. He wasn't. <nl> "I'm an invisible man from another dimension. I've been trapped here for over ten years now, but my wavelength never fully set in. Most people cannot see or feel me." <nl> "I-I don't understand. Why are you telling me all of this?" <nl> I could feel him lean forward intently, clasping my hand a little tighter. <nl> "Only you can help me Sophia. This love we share is not normal. You bumped into me because your wavelengths were similar to mine. That is how I can become visible, but that doesn't mean I'll be a pretty sight." <nl> He paused and let out a slow sigh, "I don't even remember what I look like to be honest. But in our embrace I should be able to synchronize my wavelength with your plane." <nl> "Are you human?" I asked him simply. <nl> He seemed caught off guard but answered, "I am. Different, but very much human." <nl> I set my hands on the table and let my mind's eye look at his soul. <nl> "Then none of this matters. Relin, love is blind." <eos>

<sos> EDIT: Might be NSFW <nl> There she is, as always. It's rude to point, but you've asked me to show you. There she is. Poor Lizabeth. I can tell you the story, if you like. I suppose I should. She wasn't always like this you know. She used to smile often, even in her madness. Used to talk too. I bet she doesn't even know we're here. I can't say which is better, now or before. They claim she's fixed, finally. But that don't look fixed to me. Look at her. Perhaps I should tell you the story. <nl> We all knew her from small. She was old blind Lizabeth and she lived alone on Watts Street. You know the one, near the end of the junction. Back in the eighties she would have been in her thirties then, but she looked older, and to us kids she was an old lady. We were mean I guess, and we used to trouble her some. You know how kids are. <nl> We would knock on her door, like a ding dong ditch kind of thing, but we'd just stand there a few steps back and be quiet. In those days they didn't have much for the blind, no seeing eye dogs or helpers. Old Lizabeth lived alone with her cane. <nl> She'd cuss us after awhile and then we'd laugh and run away. She had a temper and maybe that was the crazy rearing its head even all the way back then. Her outbursts encouraged us. Soon, we'd moved on to jumping her fence and making noises all round her house to scare her. <nl> And we scared her alright. She hardly left her house and she always threatened to call the police. We would hear her screaming inside like a ghost. I'm not proud to say it, but we got a real kick in those days from tormenting her. Maybe we added to her crazy. Who knows? I hope to God we didn't, but who's to say? <nl> One day old Lizabeth broke. It didn't come all at once, but that was definitely the start of it all. She was outside in the park and we were playing tag, I remember. I remember it because we all stopped running then and just stared when we saw it. <nl> Lizabeth wasn't one to leave her house and she wasn't one to sit in the park. But there she was and she was talking to someone. She was laughing. That was the first time I ever heard her laugh. And I wouldn't lie to you; I found it attractive. <nl> She was laughing alone, but she acted like she wasn't alone. Her legs were crossed and one arm was over her breasts and another hung there on the back of the bench, like she was hugging someone. <nl> She was acting all flirty then, I remember because she was blushing hard. Us boys had never really interacted with the girls in school too much and Lizabeth was the first time a lot of us saw what it's like to act so adult. <nl> And so we stared and listened and called over those who were far away and then there was a crowd just watching her and her imaginary friend. At first she was so engrossed in her talk that she couldn't hear us. It was so convincing that I swore I could hear something too, something that wasn't just Lizabeth. We all heard it in fact. But there was no one there. <nl> The brain has a way of playing tricks on you, I imagine. We stared for about under a minute when we heard a voice. <nl> "Lizabeth we should go." <nl> On my deathbed I will still swear that I heard that voice. It was a rough man's voice, but of course, there was no one there. <nl> Then Lizabeth screamed. <nl> "Go away! Go away!" <nl> And some of the crowd scattered. They had to have heard the voice too. But some of us stayed. Lizabeth got up and the wind pulled at her and her dress pulled against her body as she made for us. <nl> "Leave me alone!" <nl> And she was mad, you know? Even if you believe my theory that I'll soon get to, she was still a little off regardless. You can still see it in her face over there. See how it twitches sometimes? <nl> But anyway. When she started screaming we all scattered. Not from the regular screams of 'Get away!', but when she started screeching. She fell to her knees and her hands were above her head, like if someone was holding her, trying to get her up. And she was bawling and screeching. <nl> Some adults had heard the noise then and we were running and I didn't see anything that happened. But I knew that the news had spread. Soon Lizabeth was the talk of the town. Our parents all warned us to stay away from her. Some even asked if we ever saw any strangers around, any men mostly. I knew that they had heard the voice too, some of them. But as time passed you couldn't get them to admit as much. If you ask anyone now who lived there then if they remember the man and the voice, you'll get a bunch of blank stares. But I swear it was there back then. They asked about it. And we all knew we had heard it. <nl> Lizabeth was still out those days after. We didn't harass her as much, but some of the meaner ones, not me thankfully, would mock her when they saw her out of her house. But it was always only when she was out. <nl> When she was out she'd talk to herself. The old rumor was that her favorite thing to say was: <nl> "Why are you so quiet now? Fuck those people. Fuck what they say?" <nl> She'd say that as if the man was there. But none of us ever saw him. What we did see was the crazy take her and the happiness as well. Old Lizabeth would be smiling and laughing those days. She was never like that. It was like a completely different person. <nl> "Manic depression," my father said to my mother. <nl> The adults always gossiped when they thought we were in bed. And of course we never really stayed asleep. <nl> "It's all the drugs she probably used. It makes you crazy, like two people inside you." <nl> "She used *drugs*?" my mother said. <nl> I remember how she said it. Like she found out my father was fucking his secretary or something, pardon the language. And at the time he was, but that's another story. <nl> "Of course she is. Her mother was an addict. It's no wonder she's blind. God's just and he punishes the wicked. She has to be on something. That's why she's crazy." <nl> "We can't just leave it at that. What if she does something to the kids?" <nl> And you the eighties were like the fifties in some places. And the fifties were like the dark ages in some places. Where we lived was like the fifties, and that fifties was dark, really dark and ignorant. <nl> The breaking point for adult action happened because of us. We didn't see much of Lizabeth anymore and the whole mystery man thing had cooled down. No one saw him so it was easy for your brain to forget a voice. Your brain is good at those things. <nl> So anyway, we didn't see much of her and so we decided to go to her house. Play a prank. <nl> When we got there it was a group of us and we jumped the fence and we were quiet and we made our way to spread out around the house. We were going to all make noise and scare her. See if we could get her running. <nl> But when we were near the walls we heard it. <nl> Over the years I've asked those who I'm still in touch with what they had heard then. Almost always they just mention her. <nl> "She was masturbating," Jimmy said. <nl> He was older than me and should have remembered it clearer. <nl> Arnold said it was just Lizabeth screaming. <nl> The others didn't want to talk about it. <nl> But what I heard, and what I believe we all heard, was LIzabeth and a man having sex. They were screaming. They were grunting. <nl> I don't remember the words exactly but I remember how we felt. My face was red and I was aroused and I wanted to see and I was afraid and wanted to run. One of us screamed then when the fear of the stranger came rushing back and then we were running and the noises stopped. <nl> I don't know what happened then, but I felt Lizabeth's presence and she was behind us but we were faster and I felt another presence too but I never turned around. <nl> Soon we had all scattered and the parents were told. Someone always snitches. <nl> What happened next is like a montage of hearsay. That summer we were kept in doors. The local news was about, searching for the mystery man. Old Lizabeth was secluded in her house until one day the police came to take her in for questioning. <nl> Andrew Bralo, one of the younger kids, and a liar I might add, said he saw Lizabeth kissing a black man. Where we lived that was bad enough, but he said then that when they saw him staring, they threatened to cut his throat unless he stayed quiet. <nl> No one cared that the story was bullshit. No one questioned that Andrew said that Lizabeth was the one who saw him and shouted. All that mattered was that the hysteria was boiling, and the lid had overflowed. <nl> The police came and there were gunshots. The official report was that they heard movement and thought there was another in the house. They fired and did not hit Lizabeth, but she screamed as if they did. <nl> She was crying and kicking and saying they killed him, whoever he was. <nl> Then she was committed and the national news was starting to swoop in. The story began leaking and I think the pressure was on our mayor to make everything right. <nl> Lizabeth was diagnosed with a convenient tumor. The operated on her and it was successful, though she seems lobotomized now. She was released soon after and then childhood clouded our memories and ignorance spared the adults. Everything was forgotten and then everything was back to normal. <nl> And so it's been those decades past. She's been the same on that bench. It's the same bench we caught her talking to herself on that day so long ago. <nl> She just sits there now, in silence, wasting away. <nl> And that's my story... But you don't look satisfied. What more can I say? What's that? Oh... my theory. <eos>

<sos> "Oh, and that's a bad miss." <nl> "Indeed it is, Richard. Half the milk's on the table now. I'd pass it off as simple drunk clumsiness, if he wasn't as sober as a Mormon." <nl> You sat dumbfounded on your couch, listening to your daily routine being narrated in dulcet tones. You had already restarted the podcast several times, and now were idly wondering if you had gone off the deep end. <nl> "And now, an interview with Karen Lewis." <nl> There was a short trumpet melody. You debated turning the podcast off entirely. After all, you'd experienced this one before. <nl> "Thank you for being with us today, Karen. You work two cubicles down from our "cereal-killer", if I'm not mistaken?" <nl> A polite giggle, very feminine and *very* familiar. You began to sweat slightly. <nl> "That's right, Arnold. If it makes any difference, he's not very good at getting water from the dispenser, either." Your mind worked desperately as the narrators chuckled, racing through past memories. She hadn't been watching your daily water struggle, had she? <nl> "...I had told the boys in the editing room, too. I told them, 'the man can flirt with the best of them, just as long as she doesn't see him try to do anything else.'" <nl> "You didn't!" Karen shrieked delightedly. You groaned, your future hopes for an office romance being shattered  with every word. <nl> "He's handsome enough, I suppose, but I get the feeling that it's only skin deep, you know?" She continued, speaking in that special tone achievable only by gossipers on talk shows. <nl> "And only above the belt," one of the narrators added archly. This was greeted by more laughter. <nl> This was unbearable. Not only was your self-esteem being ravaged, it was being done Daily Show style. <nl> "...Well, we definitely enjoyed having you in here today, Karen. I'm sure Arnold agrees when I say: we should have had you on here sooner." <nl> "Thank you all, I had a wonderful time!" Karen sounded genuinely happy, something you had never heard during your conversations with her. <nl> "That was our Morning-Shift Office Talk, with the lovely Karen Lewis. Now for Lunch, followed by a special interview with Gyro Cart owner Micheal Anastas." <nl> "Ah, here he goes now, Richard. Been listening to a podcast all morning instead of doing work, now he's clocking out early for lunch." <nl> "It's amazing he still has this job, Arnold." <nl> You listen for over an hour, occasionally pacing back and forth, as every aspect of your day is picked apart and utterly defiled by this mysterious set of narrators. As the podcast draws to a close, however, one last exchange sends you over the edge. <nl> "Heartfelt thanks to everyone who's made this cast possible, and to all of our listeners who keep us in production. This was "You", by Richard Morrin and Arnold Carver." <nl> "Speaking of production, we're just about to start recording for the next episode. Stay tuned for tomorrow, folks." <nl> More soothing trumpet music played in the background as you began tearing your living room apart in search of bugs. <eos>

<sos> Honestly we were both really tired of it. <nl> Our 15 year Pregnancy Anniversary had come and gone with a further-dwindling crowd. When we hit 5 Years, I swear half of the states population came and half of America turned into our broadcast. It was overwhelming, but I suppose I can't blame them. The longest on-record was 4 years 8 months, and that kid was the doctor who created the tests to determine the superpowers of each fetus. Incredible stuff, I must say. In fact, many other 3 and 4 year fetuses went on to become these amazing researchers and doctors at his Lab. <nl> That man was born 50 years ago, and no one had ever exceeded 4 years and 3 months. <nl> I could tell that after all that time, the public lost interest. Not that we cared. Doctors grew tired of pestering over our little girl and trusted us to be able to take care of her with some home treatments. Hell, they even stopped charging us for Pregnancy-related care after the 6th year. <nl> My Wife had especially suffered for it. Our bodies have evolved for 10, 12 month pregnancies, but 15 years has taken their toll. She was in a constant state of pain in her back and neck, the baby is restless and seemed to kick daily, sometimes causing her to vomit. <nl> When the birth came, it was jarring. I asked if she was joking, but when she couldn't respond, I knew it was happening. We had to make a quiet escape or else the news stations would mob the area. The Ambulance came silently, thank god it was the middle of the night. We sped to the hospital and after 13 more hours of Labor, we had our baby girl. The doctors ran the test and found... nothing. No DNA hints on what it could be. But it was something huge. Well, so huge that the entire DNA strand was different. <nl> We watched her grow and as we did, we noticed she was *incredibly lucky.* If her 1st grade was announcing rewards for the #1 Student, she'd win every time. If we said something like "oh, I don't think we'll go to the zoo tomorrow. It's going to storm." Hell, it could be the middle of a goddamn monsoon and the rain would clear up in *minutes.*" If we said there's no way she could start a fire with her bare hands, she would conjure a flame at her fingertips. <nl> You may be thinking, "wait, that last one doesn't make sense." You're right. Cause after 7 years of countless events similar to the former, she finally told us her power. Her baby blue eyes stared big at us as she said "I can manipulate probability." <nl> We were obviously confused. But she explained. "I can see it in my head. It's like a dial. On one end it's 0, and the other it's 100. So like, there's a 72% chance that it will rain tomorrow. I can leave it there, I can make it so it won't rain no matter what, or I can make it where it will rain all day. What's the possibility of me growing bird wings and flying? 0%? Why not make that 100!!" <nl> And sure enough she awoke with a glorious set of wings. She's since removed them though. <nl> Her powers are truly limitless, and I think that's why it took 15 years to cook her up. Or so it seemed. <nl> She's 14 now. Last night she came down crying and ran into my arms. I asked her what was wrong, combing my fingers through her bright red hair. "It- It says Gramma is 100% possibly going to die tomorrow," she sniffed "an-and I can't move the dial." <eos>

<sos> You know that feeling of being absolutely, and without a shadow of a doubt, wrong? It's soul crushing for some, but uplifting for others. All my life I had laughed at the silliness of the religious people because, let's be honest here, what they were suggesting was often *silly*. <nl> I mean, Earth being a few millennia old? When you die you get seventy-something virgins (where did all those virgins come from)? Was our world a giant tree, or flat, or shaped like a cigar? Why was the Pearly Gates not made in another material? Why did Moses spend forty years in that desert? Why did you need six arms if you were a goddess? See what I'm saying? <nl> Anyway, I was wrong, and here I was about to be judged for my crimes and spend the rest of my life in... well, I was curious how they'd decide which Hell I'd go to. <nl> "She lived in New York City, that means she belongs to me," Yahweh said and hovered in front of me, his white beard flapping in some unseen breeze. <nl> I stared at the naked body of the floating god. The Christian Hell was one of the worst. I found myself inching backward. I had committed most of the sins and would definitely have a rough time down there. <nl> "Need I remind you that NYC is on an ancient burial ground of my people - that means she's mine," Gitche Manitou whispered softly. <nl> The gaseous form of the Native American deity swirled around my legs. Maybe that wouldn't be so bad - was there even a Hell in that religion? I was just about to accept when a massive man with a raven on his shoulder stepped forth, his one eye ogling his opponents. <nl> "Look at her - those blonde locks and blue eyes," Odin rumbled, "She's clearly the descendant of a Viking!" <nl> The man took a step forward and put his massive hand on my shoulder. I felt myself quivering. Then he smiled and winked at me. <nl> "I want you at my table in Valhalla," he said. "Choose me, and I'll let you sit with Freya and the Valkyries." <nl> Choose? Did I have a choice in the matter? Gaping, I stared at the crowd of gods before me. Were they all here to compete for my immortal soul? <nl> "Of course," said a man in a toga, with a lightning bolt crackling in his hand. "Have you ever been to Greece, Little Girl? Join me at Mt. Olympus, and I'll see to all your needs." <nl> "And, in return, she'll have to fill all your needs, I bet?" said a man with blue skin and four arms. "I'm sure she'd *love* to go home with a repeated sex offender or an old nudist fart!" <nl> Both Yahweh and Zeus scowled at Shiva as he floated over to me and patted me with his bottom right hand. "Come with me, and I'll show my world. My religion is one of the oldest, and you know why? Because it works! I leave no soul disappointed." <nl> "What he's not telling you, is that his heaven is basically empty... he'll send you right back to Earth in the form of a snail or insect - he'll recycle you until you no longer understand what's up or down - that's why he has no complaints because only a select few actually reach the final stage!" <nl> It was the man with the falcon head that spoke. Graciously he sauntered up to me, spinning an ankh on his index finger. <nl> "My pyramids still stand," Ra continued. "And will continue to do so, long after the churches, temples, and mosques of these fools are gone. I don't settle for anything less than greatness... Come with me, and I'll share my eternal wisdom... I'll show you the true light of the sun!" <nl> That did sound nice; I had to admit. I had always been fascinated with science in life. Perhaps with access to his wisdom, I could answer many of the questions I had? <nl> "Wisdom, hah!" said a man on a bamboo mat, his golden skin glittering as he laughed. "What wisdom can someone with a giant fidget spinner really provide?" <nl> Buddha remained cross-legged on his meditation mat but looked at me intensely. "I've meditated for thousands of years, and my insights are unparalleled. If it's wisdom you're after, please join me at my temple - a temple that, for the record, isn't made out of dusty Saharan sand, but from the lively walls of your mind." <nl> I sighed as a Mayan god approached me, and a long line of deities snaked behind him, all waiting for their turn to try and convince me. The choice seemed like an impossible one to make. <nl> "Guys, I need to think," I said and sat down under a tree. <nl> I looked at all the odd figures watching me expectantly. I'd never thought dying would be so stressful. What if I picked the wrong one? <nl> A bored-looking man with long dark hair was leaning against the tree. I didn't remember him approaching me. <nl> "Why didn't you offer me anything to choose your heaven?" I asked. <nl> "Who? Me?" he said and took a sip from a jar. "I don't really care; I'm just filling in for Jupiter." <nl> "I desperately need a drink right now." <nl> He shrugged and handed me the jar. I had expected to taste the nectar of heaven, but instead, cheap box-wine rolled down my throat. <nl> "So, what do you have to offer me?" I asked after another gulp. <nl> "Nothing, really," he said. "I usually just chill out, you know... drink wine, eat grapes... nothing interesting." <nl> I smiled. After living a stressful life, all I wanted to do was relax. <nl> "I think I'll choose your heaven," I said after a drawn out pause. <nl> The man shrugged.

<sos> The judge slammed his gavel on the wooden block and silence fell like a blanket over the court. <nl> The Dazzler sat perfectly still in her seat, her face - usually stretched wide by a warm smile - was now blank. Expressionless. <nl> "The jury find the defendant guilty on all charges." <nl> Her head fell into her hands and her body shook as she wept. The man next to her placed an arm around her shoulders. I heard him murmur soft reassurances, but I was too far back to make out the exact words of the impotent promises. <nl> "I am sad," continued the judge, "to find that your gift was not spent stopping crime, but instead from preventing it *being* stopped - and from preventing the city itself from tackling its problems at the roots. All your acts were done solely to further your career and profile. You are an egotist, in the worst and most dangerous fashion.  In your *all-for-show* heroics, Miss Jones, many innocent people died. Collateral damage to you, perhaps - but loved ones to others. Bricks falling on heads, and trains coming to sudden, horrific halts. *Heart attacks* from your ludicrous speeds when flying with people in your arms - and who could forget Mr Kennedy? It is with deep regret - *regret at the potential you wasted* - that I sentence you to the most severe punishment this court, or any other, can. To death." <nl> A wave of shock ran through the people in the court; gasps and cries and shocked nothings. A little girl near the front was in tears; her mommy picked her up and rubbed her back. "There, there. It'll be okay, honey," she cooed. <nl> But it wouldn't be 'okay'. <nl> The Dazzler wouldn't protest the decision. <nl> She wouldn't even fight for her life. <nl> Pathetic. <nl> I knew she'd give in, because she respected the law. Believed in justice - her world was built on unshakeable foundations. She'd allow herself to die for childish dreams and impossible ideals. She'd allow the city to twist the knife deep into her back. <nl> It had been so easy to pay off the criminals of the city for a few short weeks. Their sprees could continue soon, and there would be no Dazzler to stop them. The hope of the city, when they realised what they had done to their hero, would be snuffed out like a candle - the rising smoke lingering forever in the skies above them. <nl> A smog that would slowly suffocate them. <nl> I excused myself from the courtroom, holding the grin from my face until I was safely behind the wooden doors. <nl> --- <nl> I asked one of my favourite writers if she'd like to write a part 2, and she very kindly agreed - so please check out Lilwa's reply below :) <nl> More of my stories on /r/nickofnight <eos>

<sos> Lucy lay shivering in bed, her hands clutching the sweat-soaked duvet tightly around her, the bed heater back on.  It had been lke this for the past three days, and she wished she was already dead.  The boiling heat alternated with freezing cold for hours at a time, and every muscle of her body seemed to protest as she slowly forced herself to sit up, to push the duvet away long enough to pull the laptop closer to her. <nl> She typed her bank account password in with quivering fingers, and cringed.  The money was still gone, and without that, she couldn't afford the bus fare to the clinic across town, let alone the drug. <nl> Her neck ached with the effort to hold her neck up, and she rested it gently against the back of the bed.  She had maybe another 12 hours before she died, and her hopes that George was coming back were fading fast.  Damn, but she had been such a fool.  They'd been dating for 6 months now, and he'd said he needed her card to buy something online, would she mind. <nl> She'd hesitated.  Looking back, she winced.  He'd looked so hurt - don't you trust me? - and she'd foolishly given in. <nl> The next day he'd text her to cancel their planned dinner, as he had to go on a work trip.  Two days later, her money was gone, and he was safe.  The police couldn't help, the loans company wouldn't, and she was ... well, dead.  Even the charities she'd reached out to had turned her away, because she had been wealthy enough to afford medicine until only a few days before. <nl> Their work, they had stressed, was for people who were employed in lower wage jobs, and couln't afford both drugs and food.  Those with children.  Couldn't she ask her parents for money? <nl> Of course, Lucy could, theoretically.  But she wouldn't.  Maybe she even couldn't. <nl> Finally, as a last resort, Lucy had asked her boss for her wages in advance to cover her.  Just until the end of the month, she'd stressed.  She'd be able to save and skrimp enough to cover the cost of the drug on that, surely. <nl> He'd told her to go home and look after herself, that he'd see what he could do... but given that her bank account was still sat at a resolute, red zero.  Well. <nl> Perhaps it was for the best.  She forced herself out of bed and across to the kitchen sink.  It was the first time since she'd moved in that she was glad all she could afford was a bedsit.  Not bothering to grab a glass, she leaned slowly forward until her tongue could touch the stream of water, tilted her head to one side, and gulped thirstly.  Then, groaning, she shuffled back to bed, threw her duvet onto the floor, and spread out, her skin on fire. <nl> Lucy slept. <nl> She was forced awake by a dry, prickly mouth, and sat up slowly.  The fever seemed to have worked its way out of her system, and although still a little sore, she could stand without an internal dialogue.  She grinned. <nl> But, wait. <nl> She should be dead.  "Is this... heaven?"  She asked aloud, looking around her deserted room.  Maybe someone had come in, given her something - but the door was still deadbolted, the window latched. <nl> Her hands still shook as she poured a glass of water.  Maybe, she thought, this was the second wind, the nice bit before death.  But she felt fine.  Better than fine.  She almost wanted to dance with how fine she felt. <nl> "I'm alive."  She told the wall, confidently.  Then she turned to the stuffed cat an old friend had bought her, and told it too.  "I'm alive!" <nl> She span around in a circle, which was somewhat ill-advised as she immediately felt dizzy.  She hadn't eaten anything more nutrious than the few slices of dry toast she had nibbled in her bed on the few occasions she had made it to the kitchen, before it had gone blue. <nl> "Ok," she said, "I need to eat." <nl> She had a yoghurt in the fridge, which she consumed while rooting through her freezer drawer for a ready meal.  Nothing.  Dammit.  And she still had no money for shopping. <nl> Three bendy carrots, a slightly mushy bag of spinach, and three sausages would have to do then, and she quickly set to work. <nl> How was she not dead? <nl> Rach!  She had to call Rach! <nl> She whirled around, the spitting sausages forgotten momentarily, and scrambled among her bedding for her phone.  Which was dead. <nl> She swore, then plugged it in next to the hob, balancing it on the top of the microwave.  Finally, the battery symbol came on, and she mashed the power button with her thumb, the other hand futily jostling the sausages. <nl> "Lucy?"  A dubious voice picked up.  "Why are you calling me?" <nl> "Rach, listen.  I know it's been a while.  I know I said some stupid, horrible things.  But you need to know something." <nl> "Ok." <nl> "Take a seat.  Somewhere quiet, somewhere alone.  Please, this is important." <nl> "Give me a minute." <nl> Lucy grabbed at the sausages with one hand and dumped them onto a plate, too hungry to care if they were done.  Then, sucking her burnt fingers, she tapped the speakerphone button and pulled her chair closer to the phone. <nl> "What is it, Luce?" <nl> "You were right." <nl> "What?" <nl> "You were right.  I... look, it's a long story, but I didn't have money for tablets this month." <nl> "Are you alright?" <nl> "Yes, yes, that's the point.  I didn't take them, but I'm also still alive." <nl> There was a staticy silence on the phone for a few heartbeats.  "Are you sure?" <nl> "What do you mean, am I sure?"  Lucy took a bite of sausage, and spoke around it.  "Of course I'm sure." <nl> "We can't talk on the phone.  They might be listening." <nl> Lucy bit down the urge to tell her she was being paranoid - after all, that had been part of their fight in the first place - and, she realised, if Rachel had been right about this... <nl> "Just answer a few questions, OK?"  Lucy hummed her agreement.  "OK.  When was your last dose?"   "4 days ago."  "What were your symptoms?"  "Mostly fever."  "Where are you now?"  "Town centre, Burkley Street."  "I'm on my way.  Stay there, don't open the door to anyone.  Do you understand?"  "Yes." <nl> Rachel hung up.  Lucy continued eating her sausages. <nl> 5 minutes later there was a knock at the door.  It was only instinct that kept her from calling out.  Instead, she slowly slid along the floor, her heart thundering in her chest.  Another knock, loud and authoritative.  "Miss Naze.  I know you're in there.  Please answer the door." <nl> She held her breath.  "Miss Naze, please.  We don't want to hurt you." <nl> Trying desperately to be as quiet as possible, she breathed in, and then out.  How did they know she was there. <nl> A new voice, female, spoke.  "We're working with Rachel Thearm.  She asked us to pick you up, as our team was closer." <nl> Now Lucy knew that these people weren't going to help her.  Rach would have told her if she was delegating the task.  But while they were here, would Rach be able to come help her. <nl> There were another few minutes of tense silence, and then Lucy heard footsteps heading from her door down the corridor.  Were they trying to trick her?  Convinced she'd died? <nl> A thud, on the wall.  She squealed in shock, and clasped a hand over her mouth.  Another thud.  My god, were they breaking down the wall? <nl> Without thinking about it, she grabbed a knife from the washing up pile and clenched it in a white fist.  She would not die, not after surviving that fever.  She would fight. <nl> There was a silence, stretched across several seconds, and then somehow the bolt on the door began to draw back.  She lunged across the room, and pushed it shut again, fighting against some other force. <nl> "Hey."  A whisper came.  "It's ok, just me.  Open up." <nl> Somehow, Lucy couldn't trust the voice, even if it sounded a little like Rachel with her posh, English accent.  "Seriously, Luce, open up.  I have approximately 5 minutes to get you out of here before they wake up." <nl> Tentatively, Lucy pressed her lips up against the crack of the door.  "What did you give me, the night before we went to prom?" <nl> "A stuffed lion.  Babe, come on, we need to go." <nl> Scared, still clutching the knife, Lucy baked away from the bolt.  It moved again.  Then there was Rachel's grinning face, pushing it open, grabbing Lucy and pulling her through.  Two crumpled SWAT officers were by the door, heads resting against one another. <nl> Rachel was dressed in black, riot police like clothes, a small handgun clenched in one hand.  Silently, she pulled Lucy down the hall, into a stairwell, and down they went.  "Luce babe, I'm so glad you called." <nl> Lucy, concious of her knife - and her dirty pyjamas - said nothing.  She didn't know what to do, whether to trust Rachel.  She had no other choice. <nl> "You're a medical marvel, Luce.  I have some doctors I want you to meet."  She paused by the door to the basement, looked Lucy up and down, and pulled her into a quick hug.  "Come on, we've got work to do." <eos>

<sos> The creature was small and delicate, with spindly limbs covered in thin white hairs. She was frozen in place. <nl> One of its fingers curled, and its round head bobbed insistently. It was beckoning to her; as her heart fluttered nervously, she leaned forward until they were nose to nose. It grasped at the fabric of her space suit and pulled her closer, bringing its mouth to her ear. <nl> And then its hand whipped out, a finger jabbed her in the chest, and it said, "You're it." The creature giggled like a child, scurrying away with its head wobbling back and forth. <nl> Standing there with her mouth parted, she watched her chance at world-renowned achievement skip through an alien wilderness. She came to a sudden, irrational decision: she had to chase after it. <nl> The oxygen levels were just high enough to support a little bit of running, so she tossed aside her space helmet and dove into the forest of red vines. As she plunged deeper and deeper into the planet, dust swirled around each step and left dented footprints in the sandy dirt. She was following its path of bird-like tracks, stopping every so often to catch her breath or get her bearings. <nl> When she finally found the creature, it was curled into a ball, staring out at her with wide eyes. She grabbed it roughly by the elbow, and it shrieked in delight. <nl> "Say it," it told her. "Say it, say it!" <nl> She raised an eyebrow at it, cheeks flushed from exertion. "We're not playing games, you extraterrestrial bobble head." <nl> It gave her a look of innocent confusion. "I'm it?" <nl> The astronaut dragged the little alien back through the forest, and hacked at vines the whole way; the creature was oddly quiet. When they reached the shuttle, it began to scrabble at the ground. Its fingers and toes clutched at the dust, leaving claw marks in the sand. <nl> The color drained from its face. "No thank you," it said shrilly. "No! No thank you!" It squirmed and kicked against her, hissing and biting, before suddenly going silent again. <nl> "Crap," said the astronaut, feeling for a heartbeat. They were, after all, fragile-looking creatures, and she was afraid she'd strangled it on accident. <nl> A finger darted up and poked her in the nose. "You're it!" And off it scampered, over the shuttle and into the tunnels behind it. She raced after it. <nl> Her radio buzzed, and a grainy voice came through: "Where are you, dammit? Over." <nl> "Busy," she answered through gritted teeth. "Over." <nl> "For Christ's sake, Sarah, we thought something took you. Why the hell didn't you answer? Over." <nl> She stumbled on a purple root, falling soundly into the hard rock of the tunnel. <nl> "Sarah?" <nl> "I found something." There was a slickness to the rock that made climbing difficult -- her knuckles were white as they gripped the cracks and crevices. <nl> "We need you back at the lab. Over." <nl> A chittering noise came from her right, and her head moved to follow the sound. Then she heard the tell-tale giggle. "Quiet," she whispered into the radio. <nl> "Sarah-- " <nl> The quiet laughter stopped. "Crap!" <nl> "Are you okay?" <nl> "I lost it again." The astronaut sighed. "Look, I've got to catch this thing. I'll be back later. Over and out." She switched the radio off. <nl> And then she followed the alien through the tunnels. It is likely that the astronaut and the alien have played that game a long, long time, because not a soul heard from her ever again. <eos>

<sos> Sophie was so used to the creatures crowding her vision, she rarely gave them a second glance anymore. <nl> Giant hulking rabbit with four eyes and wings, dragons that wheeled over the cities, massive, slick sea creatures that gamboled and played in the rivers and oceans. She wasn't able to touch them, and they never seemed to see her - but they were always something that was uniquely hers. She wrote stories about them, but never showed her writing to anyone. That would make the creatures real to others, and they were *hers*. Until she saw the man painting in the park. <nl> He had somehow found the perfect, shifting molten shade of gold to capture the glint of the sleeping dragon's folded wings. She ventured closer, certain that he wouldn't look up at her approach. He must be one of the ghosts of this shadow world that weren't actually real. <nl> It was probably just her imagination weaving absurdly vivid pictures, or some delusion. She really should see a professional soon, but it was so lovely to have this ability. What if she were prescribed antipsychotics, and the world became drab and colourless, none of her creatures to fill the skies and the oceans? What if her imagination disappeared too, and she couldn't write anymore at all? She didn't want to let it go. Why, even this man seemed magical, with his swirling cloak, and waves of ink black hair like a raven's wing... <nl> "Do people in your realm never greet properly?" he suddenly spoke softly, pausing where he had been painting the creature's massive front claw. <nl> Her mouth dropped open, and he smiled widely at her disbelief. <nl> "Oh, great," she muttered. "Auditory hallucinations, too, what fun." <nl> To prove it, the other people in the park were giving her nervous looks, as if afraid she would attack them at any moment. The man gave a rich chuckle and turned back to his picture, mixing gold and white to get the colour of the creature's belly just right. <nl> "Oh, you're no more 'crazy' than any of the people in your world," he told her. "Just gifted enough to catch the odd glimpses of the other realms. Where do you think your greatest artists and writers found their inspiration? You know, I like you. Do you know the name of my friend over there?" <nl> She dismissed the strangeness of the conversation to focus on the question. It seemed vastly important, suddenly, and she found the name as she looked upon the dragon. <nl> "Ryna," she said, and he nodded slowly. On the grass, the dragon rolled in its sleep and gave a soft rumble. <nl> "Good guess. It's close enough - it seems you're more in tune with our realm than I thought," he said. "Look, he almost heard you. Names are important, girl, remember that. It's the call between realms. What is yours?" <nl> "Sophie," she said, without thinking, and his black eyes gleamed brightly. "What's yours?" <nl> "Sophie," he echoed her name softly, ignoring her question, and touched her hand. <nl> She felt it, a warm and fleeting brush of skin. "Well, Sophie. I can allow you to become a greater part of our world, if you wish. I can be your...guide, as it were. My realm will unlock your potential in...what do you like to do? Are you a painter, like me, or perhaps you sing?" <nl> "Well, I do like to write, sometimes," she whispered, almost afraid to say it out loud. "But I'm not any good." <nl> "Ah, a *writer*. I do love writers. After you visit, you will write like never before," he winked at her. "I know, I've seen it happen. I've taken some from your realm before. Edgar Allan Poe was one of our most famous visitors, and a dear friend to me. A talented man...it's funny, he was always able to see me, you know. Never got my name quite right, though, no matter how many times I told him." <nl> He lapsed into a thoughtful silence. <nl> "But there is danger, too, I won't lie, and perhaps you will curse me for drawing you in," he continued slowly. "But perhaps you'll enjoy it, it's always so difficult to know how one of you will react. Perhaps you are strong enough. Call on me if you wish for it. But remember - with every visit, you will become more removed from your own plane. It could become difficult to fully return. Some have lost themselves along the way." <nl> "This isn't real, is it?" Sophie asked, as the man turned his back on her and finished the painting. <nl> "I see you need convincing," he chuckled, and took the painting from the easel. The fresh paint gleamed and the colours seemed to shift, unnaturally bright in the afternoon sun. He handed it to her with a strange little grin. <nl> "Here, a little memento from me, it will prove how real I am. And I'll give you another gift: the name's Nevamor. Call on me if you wish, Sophie, and I will visit again. Think it over well." <nl> She walked home in a daze, staring at the picture of the sleeping dragon sprawled on the grass. It was an almost perfect rendition of the dragon. Ryna. <nl> Her roommate, Elizabeth, frowned when she let herself into the apartment. As always, Sophie looked like she was tripping on five kinds of drugs. <nl> "Hey. You ok?" Liz asked her. <nl> "I'm fine," Sophie sighed, putting the picture on the coffee table. <nl> She would make an appointment to see a psychiatrist this week, she promised herself. Hallucinating the feel and touch of a man's hand and a whole painting was becoming less harmless and more frightening. It would be best if she just tried to forget about all of it, and never called the man's name. That would just indulge her delusions. <nl> "Well, ok. I'm going out, there's leftovers in the fridge," Liz said, heading to the door. "Nice painting, by the way. Where'd you get it?" <nl> Sophie was staring at her, eyes stretched wide in shock. Liz shrugged and headed out, shaking her head a bit at her roommate's behaviour. <nl> Hours later, when she returned to an empty apartment, she tried not to worry - even though Sophie had promised she'd be home tonight. Her roommate had always been a rather odd one, and liked to wander off on her own. Sophie would be fine, wherever she was. <nl> On the windowsill, a raven Elizabeth couldn't see gave a cawing laugh she never heard. <nl> -------- <nl> [**Part Two added here.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Inkfinger/comments/6ntlb4/ever_since_you_were_a_kid_you_were_able_to_see/) <nl> Hope you enjoyed my story!

<sos> Mana wiped her brow on her sleeve and put another batch of donuts in the oven. During the summer it got so hot inside the little shop that she could soon bake on the counter. This was the opening day of her store and she was already growing dizzy. She looked over and saw that a customer was waiting. <nl> "Just a minute!" she called out and tried to straighten out her wrinkly apron. "Hi, welcome to Mana & Other Sweet Things! What can I get you?" <nl> The man looked very different from the peasants that had visited her shop earlier. He wore a long black robe, despite the hot weather, and his pale face was partially covered by the shade of a cloak. With a bony hand, he put a white lock of hair behind his ear, revealing three golden hoops in his earlobe. <nl> "I'm looking for something sweet," he said, "Something to get the necromancy flowing." <nl> "Well, you've come to the right place then!" <nl> "How much does it cost?" he said and fumbled with his gold pouch. <nl> "That depends on what you'd like." <nl> The man's forehead rippled in furrows. He touched his chin and sighed. <nl> "Do you have any donuts?" he said, and tilted his head forward, looking at Mana intently. <nl> "Of course," she chimed. "They're my specialty." <nl> "Can I have a taste before I decide?" <nl> "I usually don't do tastings." <nl> "Then how can I know if it's good?" <nl> "I suppose you're right," Mana said and cut out a piece of donut and handed it over on a paper plate. <nl> "Oh, yes," the man said, his gray eyes lighting up. "This is it; this is what I've been looking for!" <nl> "I'm glad you liked it," Mana said, smiling. <nl> "No, you don't understand," the man said, flapping his arms. "This is it! This is the one! You are the one!" <nl> "What?" Mana said with a laugh. <nl> She knew her donuts were good, but she had never before seen anyone become so ecstatic. <nl> "You're the only hope for humanity," he said sweat dripping down his forehead. "I've traveled land and sea to find you." <nl> "Okay, sir," Mana said and helped him to a chair. "It's probably best if you sit down, the heat must've gotten to you. Here, have a glass of water." <nl> The man in the robe drank deeply. "I'm telling you; people will come and when they do you have a choice-" <nl> At that very moment, the doorbell chimed and three other robed figures entered. The tallest one, a man with a beard and round glasses, spoke first. <nl> "We've traveled far!" <nl> "Oh, how far we've traveled!" the man with the square-shaped glasses muttered without enthusiasm. "Very, very, veeeeeeeeeeery far." <nl> Mana felt a jolt in her chest. The man in the black robe looked her in the eyes. <nl> "Remember what I told you," he said and hurried out of the store. <nl> The third of the three, a bearded man with triangular glasses, walked up to the counter and spoke for the first time. <nl> "I've never seen such a well-organized pastry shop before..." he said. "Utterly top notch, it's like I've walked into the royal bakery and the king himself had organized it." <nl> Another jolt surged through Mana's body. "Yes, I'm sorry - I opened just this morning - I haven't had time to put prices on everything yet." <nl> "I'll have one of those!" the man said and pointed at a carrot-cake cupcake. "That is if I can afford it - who knows, that piece of pastry might be more expensive than Archmage Ruttersmore's cross-eyed cluck-duck. There's no real way of knowing, is there?" <nl> "It's two silver pieces, sir," Mana said as her face flushed, and newfound power flowed through her. <nl> "Well, I guess they're about the same price..." <nl> If she wanted, she now felt like she had the power to throw these schmucks to the other side of the city. Mana had never wanted to be a big mage - all she wanted to do was bake - so when her time had come, she had picked the most stupid source of power that she could think of. So that she would be left alone. <nl> "We know who you are, Mana. The council sent us here to test your powers. Now if you would be so kind to come with us - you're the first person to choose sarcasm as their source - and we need to bring you in for..." <nl> "Further experiments," his companion filled in. <nl> "Well, it'd be such a delight to accompany you, I'll come right away," she said and flicked her wrist. <nl> The three wizards landed on their butts on the street outside. <nl> "And I'd just loooove to be experimented on a bit," she continued.  "You're welcome back *anytime* you want!" <nl> Her powers at an all-time high, Mana placed the strongest sanctuary spell ever seen in the twelve kingdoms on her little bakery. The wooden walls glowed with magical energy. Spent, she sat down behind the counter. Nobody that she didn't want inside would able to enter, not even the Archmage's golden cluck-duck. And to top it off, the sanctuary spell had a built-in AC. <nl> ***** <nl> Subscribe to r/Lilwa_Dexel for more stories. <eos>

<sos> "Sarah?" asked the necromancer. His mouth was dry and his heart beat like a gavel in his ears. Every time, the anticipation - *the hope* - swallowed him up and allowed him to imagine she was back. Then, it would chew him up and spit him out, and he would feel the same terrible things as when he'd found her body in the bathroom. <nl> It took her a moment to realise she had returned. She craned her neck up to look for the necromancer. He stood at the end of the table, his lips trembling, and his pale face wearing a smile that was at the same time hopeful and utterly desperate. It pained her to see him like this. <nl> "I'm sorry, James." <nl> "Diana..." he whispered, as he slumped down against a bookshelf. "It's you again..." <nl> Diana's arms gained feeling before her legs; one at a time, she threw her thighs off the table and, using her legs as anchors, sat up.  James' face was more lined than before and his hairline had scampered further back. His eyes were gray and hollow. Diana thought he was the most tortured soul she'd ever seen. <nl> She turned her head slowly and looked about the basement; the bookshelves held many new black tomes, thick and weathered. There were both more crosses and pentagrams dotted around the room - more of his wife's old dresses, too. Then, she saw the mirror and let out a gasp. <nl> James looked up. "Are you okay, Diana?" <nl> "Where... where did you get the body from?" She gently touched her face, running a finger down the smooth curves of her cheeks. <nl> "Oh. She was in a skiing accident. Broke her neck. You," he paused and frowned, "you didn't think I killed her, did you?" <nl> "No! The thought never crossed my mind," she lied. <nl> "Good. Because, you know me better than that by now, I think." <nl> "Of course. It's just I was taken back... *she's so beautiful*." <nl> James nodded. "I think Sarah would have been happy with it." <nl> She nodded. "James," Diana began, reaching down and stretching her legs out, "you can't keep doing this." <nl> "I'm *so* close, Diana. I think I even know where I went wrong - next time I'll get it!" <nl> Diana sighed. "James, listen to me. She's not coming back." <nl> "You're wrong!" he snapped. "I just need to keep going. I need to keep trying." <nl> Diana saw tears welling in the necromancer's eyes, and felt a warm wetness running down her own cheeks. She couldn't stand it any longer. It would hurt him, but she had to do it. She had to put an end to this - for her sake, and for his. <nl> "James, you know how she died." <nl> "Yes, of course.  She was murdered - and I wasn't there to protect her." <nl> "You found her in the bath." <nl> "They slit her wrists," he said, his face blank and his voice suddenly void of emotion. <nl> "*She* slit her wrists." <nl> "No. That's not what happened." <nl> "I've spoken to her, James. Many times." <nl> "*What?*" he said, his eyes widening and his teeth clenching together. "Why wouldn't you have told me that before!" <nl> "I didn't want to tell you because, I thought it would hurt you too much." <nl> He paused for a moment. "When you go back, I need you to find her. Tell her, I'll find a way to bring her here. Tell her, I love her." <nl> "She loves you too, James." <nl> "I know," he whispered. <nl> "But she doesn't want to come back. She can't. She chose to leave the world, not just you. Trying to force her back, because you miss her... it's... it's just selfish." <nl> "Go back," James said, getting up from the floor. "Go back, before I send you back myself." Both his arms and voice were trembling. <nl> "Please, James." <nl> "Go back!" he screamed, running to a shelf and snatching a knife. "Or I swear to God..." <nl> Diana swallowed. She forced herself off the table and began walking toward James. She *had* to get to him, to make him see - but she only managed a single step before her legs gave way and she fell to the cold, concrete floor. Her head bounced off the ground and pain shot through her body. <nl> James walked over to her, knife in hand. He turned her over; blood dribbled out of her forehead, dyeing her blonde hair a sticky strawberry. <nl> "I'm sorry," he said. <nl> "Please... don't bring me back anymore," she said, as the knife hung over her chest. "Let this be the end." <nl> There was something new in her voice - or maybe it was in her eyes - that surprised James. It was something *familiar*. <nl> "Sarah?" he whispered as his face grew pale. <nl> The blade rested above her for a few seconds, swaying back and forth like a pendulum. She thrust her arms up and grabbed hold of his hands; she forced them down, plunging the knife deep into her chest. <nl> She could feel her life slipping away. Somewhere far in the distance, she could hear James screaming - *begging*. <nl> "Goodbye, baby," she said, as the light dwindled to darkness. <nl> --- <nl> /r/nickofnight <eos>

<sos> Their parents tell them that they're too young to wander off by themselves. Jen doesn't look too young though, she looks really big ever since she woke up. It's neat, everyone thinks she's a grown up now and that means she can do lots of things she couldn't before without anyone shouting. Mummy and Daddy still shout because they know she's not really a grown up, but nobody else can tell. <nl> It's really helpful because it means she can show Ellie what a cool older sister she is. Ellie is only little; she wasn't even in Mummy's tummy when Jen went to sleep. Jen really wants Ellie to be her friend so she thinks she'll take her to do a big girl thing together - something Ellie couldn't do if Jen were still asleep. <nl> They leave the garden quietly and start walking hand in hand. It's not hard to find the mall, Jen is really good at reading and there are signs all the way from the main road near the house right up to the mall car park. It takes a long time, hours and hours, and their feet hurt when they arrive. They go inside and look in all the shops and have a really good time even though they can't buy anything. Nobody asks them where their parents are all day. Nobody thinks to stop them. Why would they? <nl> There aren't any signs leading from the mall to the house. <eos>

<sos> Hi! I'm new to Writing Prompts and I'd appreciate any feedback you're willing to give! <nl> -------------------- <nl> Katrina pulled her clothes tightly across her shoulders and looked down. All she wanted to do was pay for her groceries. But no; They had to ask. Everytime. Every. Single. Time. <nl> "You got any clue what it means yet?" Pete, the cashier, asked. <nl> Kat quickly took a swig of water. "Hmm?" She hummed, desperately digging for her credit card. Of course, Kat knew what he was asking about. She had told them that she had received a tattoo resembling a water bottle. She hadn't, but it was easier than telling people that she didn't have any. A tattoo of a water bottle was also strange enough that people would believe her when she said that she didn't know what it meant. <nl> No one in this town could mind their own business. Everywhere Kat went, she saw burly men proudly displaying their art-filled biceps and speaking stories of heroism. Some of her friends had "4.0," or images depicting their sleepless nights of studying to pass a class. Others had their current League of Legends ranking proudly displayed. Everyone had something. Except Kat. <nl> It wasn't that Kat was a bad student, or that she sucked at video games; it was quite the opposite really. The tattoos were meant to represent a great achievement, and, well, those things didn't cut it for Kat. <nl> "Your tattoo," Pete leaned closer, eager to hear about Kat's achievement, "what does it mean? Jason said you got a waterbottle." <nl> Kat's lips fell into a scowl. Kat yearned to return to the days before Jason got over his fear of public speaking and received a microphone tattoo on his throat. He used to be someone she could talk to; he used to be someone she could trust to tell that she hadn't received a tattoo. <nl> Lying to him-- telling him about her "tattoo" -- was probably one of the hardest things she had done. But it was necessary. At least, that's what Kat told herself. Nowadays, he couldn't keep his mouth shut. No one in this godforsaken town could. <nl> "No clue," Kat mumbled, "still figuring it out." <nl> She handed Pete her credit card. In the process, she knocked over her water bottle, and liquid spilled all over the counter. <nl> Kat cursed and scanned the room for paper towel. She ran over to the dispenser and got a few sheets. <nl> "No, no," Pete began, "it's quite alright. We'll get it." <nl> "I got it," Kat insisted, "and, hey, who knows, this could be what my tattoo is for: cleaning up after my mistakes." She laughed bitterly. <nl> There was more water spillage than Kat initially thought. And it wasn't just over the counter; she somehow managed to spray water onto Pete's "employee of the month" tattoo across his forearm. <nl> Kat cursed again. "Sorry. Let me help you with that." <nl> "Seriously," Pete cleared his throat and backed away. <nl> "No, really, it's ok," Kat said as she grabbed his wrist and wiped his arm with the towel. As she did so, the white paper towel became streak with green and yellow. <nl> Kat's eyes widened. "What the...?" <nl> Edit: a word <nl> Edit 2: removed "it was fake" to better flow into part 2. <eos>

<sos> I was in complete shot when I saw her. Halfway across the world here I was, and in the shadows of the Eiffle Tower she reached up to take off her sunglasses. That's when I spotted that precious bare skin, like a gift sent down from heaven for me. <nl> "Pardone moi!" I screamed in my terrible, terrible French and rushed toward her, "Je suis... eh... Tu..." <nl> "It's okay, I'm American," she said back with a tone that betrayed nothing if not boredom, "What is it?" <nl> American! It wouldn't have mattered at all, of course, but knowing that she speaks my language, knows my world, it made the entire situation that much sweeter. To top it off, she was gorgeous, easily more gorgeous than any woman I'd seen in years. <nl> "Your wrist!" I immediately fumbled out, pointing toward her arm, "You don't have one either! I've never seen anyone else that didn't have it!" <nl> "Ha, good one," she shot back as she dismissively waved her arm toward my own wrist. Of course I was far too nervous, I should have told her that I draw mine on. <nl> "No, no!" I stuttered out, holding up my wrist, "This thing? This thing is--" <nl> "Fake, right? You draw it on? Or no, wait, it's a stamp? Yeah, yeah. I've heard 'em all." <nl> "What?" I said back, confused. <nl> "Listen bozo, you're not the first guy to try this, and I'm not interested. I'm not some one-night stand, you prick, and the fact that I'm destined to look around for anybody out there who may or may not exist doesn't have me too excited to play these stupid little pick-up games." <nl> "No! I promise you" I hurriedly yelled out, "Just look, I'll wash it off! Come with me, there's a cafe around the corner and watch me wash it off!" <nl> "Riiiight, cafe around the corner. You don't quit, do you? Well I do," she finished and briskly walked off. I tried to chase after, but in moments she flooded into a crowd and disappeared. <eos>

<sos> She wasn't the only one who refused her words, of course. But most people eventually said them after a few centuries, driven by boredom or heartache or apathy. Or pain. <nl> You could suffer in pain for eternity, but still you would live, unless you said the words. Others insisted you simply came to long for proper rest, or so Elsa had been told. But she never had. She was approaching 750, and she had never grown tired of life. She privately believed that was why the Gods had given her the words she had known since birth: a curse to balance her never-ending hunger for life. <nl> Today, she was choking on them. <nl> She considered his face, tight with pain as he laboured for breath. Before long, he would be too far gone to hear and understand what she said. He might become one of the countless withered bodies that never left the state facilities dedicated to such cases. Too delirious to remember his words, he would hang in limbo for eternity. James was nearly there already. And she owed him the words, even though he had never demanded them. She owed him everything. <nl> The window was open, and Elsa stepped closer to take a breath of the crisp night air, smiling at the twin moons that winked at her from the sky. It was a lovely planet, newly opened for habitation. They had meant to spent at least a century here, but life happens. Death happens. <nl> Any minute now, a nurse would come for the nightly check-up. They would be done before then. <nl> "I love you," she told James, her 30th partner. Her last and most vibrant of partners, wasted almost beyond recognition now. The bones of his once full cheeks were jutting out. She smiled to see his eyes flutter open, to catch one more glimpse of those luminous blue eyes. The rest of him had faded, but never those eyes. <nl> He grasped her hands, a surprisingly strong grip. She laboured for breath herself now, as he groped for his words. Her heart leapt as she saw him smile, that same teasing smile he had given her so many times during the past two centuries. Whenever he hugged her and kissed her neck, or presented her with flowers after she had done some small thing for him. Whenever he wanted to say his own words, but couldn't. <nl> "Thank you," he breathed, and silence reigned as a chill wind swept through the room. He was coming, but Elsa wasn't worried. <nl> She wasn't alone. <nl> --------- <nl> Hope you enjoyed my story! You can find more of my work on /r/Inkfinger/. <eos>

<sos> "Who are you?" Michael yelled at the approaching silhouette that seemed to be dragging itself through the spiralling cloud of red, desert dust, toward them. He raised a hand to his eyes and squinted, trying to get a better look at the figure - trying to decide if he should grab his little sister's hand and run far away from here, never turning, never looking back. But he knew they couldn't run. They'd *probably* die if they stayed, but he was certain they would die if they ran. It had been so long since they'd seen someone else - *anyone* else. He had thought they were the last. <nl> The figure was tall - even hunched over as it was, struggling to walk, Michael guessed it must have been at least seven foot. It clutched something long and curved in its right hand. <nl> "Michael, Cibby is scared," whispered Isabella, clutching her beloved, no-legged doll tightly in the crook of her good arm. <nl> Michael looked at his little sister, sighed, then crouched down until he was eye level with her. Sweat was pouring out from her burning forehead and dribbling down to her torn, lilac tee. It was a sweat that they couldn't replace; there was no water here. There seemed to be no water left on Earth. He gently ran the back of his fingers down Isabella's cheek. <nl> "Me too, Izzy. But we all need to be brave right now. Whoever is coming, we need their help.  You're still not better - although, I'm sure you will be soon," he added, "and, well, we've not seen *anyone* since..."  His voice trailed off as he thought of their parents. <nl> Isabella bit her lip, looked up at the swirling, tombstone sky above and nodded. "We'll be brave." <nl> "Good girl. Make sure you stay behind me, okay? Let me talk to him," Michael commanded, stepping in front of his sister. "And if... anything happens to me. Anything bad, I want you to run as fast as you can, back the way we came." Michael turned to face the approaching figure. He could now make out the ragged cloak that hung loose around the thin body; the pointed blade that trailed on the desert floor, biting into the earth as it dragged along. But he couldn't see the features of the face hidden in the brooding shadow of the hood. <nl> "Hello!" said Michael, raising a hand. The figure didn't respond; it continued trudging toward them. <nl> "We- we don't mean you harm. My sister's sick and we've not had water for-" <nl> Michael's mouth dropped open when he saw the skeletal feet poking out from the bottom of the cloak. "Oh, Jesus." Now he was ready to run. He'd rather die on the radiation plains, his skin peeling and his heart dripping, than let this monstrosity come any closer. But his curiosity had never been greater; it took hold of his body and froze it in place. <nl> "*What the fuck are you?*" he mouthed. <nl> The figure stopped a few feet from him. It tilted its head to the side, raised a bony hand to its face and peeled back its hood. <nl> "*Oh, shit.* Izzy," he said, as he reached behind him, fumbling for his sister's hand, "get ready to run. Okay?" <nl> "Pleaaase," came the terrible, pleading voice; it sounded as if it was being dragged through broken glass, as it rose up through the creature's throat. <nl> Isabella poked her head out from behind her brother. She gasped. <nl> "Pleaaase," came the voice again. The creature raised a hand, its fingers reaching toward them. Then, it collapsed onto its knees, its scythe dropping to the ground. <nl> "Let's go, okay sis?" said Michael, trying not to show the fear in his voice. <nl> "...we can't go. I think it needs our help," said Izzy. "It's in pain." <nl> "Izzy! What are you doing?" Michael hissed, as his sister slowly walked toward the creature, until she stood only a foot away from it. <nl> "My name is Izzy," she said, before bursting into a cough that ripped her throat and tore at her lungs.  It took her a moment to recover; she wiped the blood from her lips onto her arm. "This - this is Cibby, and that's my brother Michael," said the girl. "We don't have any water, but we have a little food. Would you like some?" <nl> The creature stared at Izzy for a moment, before, with what looked like great effort, stretched a hand out toward her. <nl> "Don't!" shouted Michael, but it was too late. Izzy had already taken the pale hand in hers. <nl> It took only a second for her to fall limply to the ground, doll by her side. <nl> "Izzy!" Michael screamed, running toward his sister and skidding to the ground next to her. "Oh God, Izzy," he said, as snot and hot tears mixed in his mouth. Her eyes were shut and her chest was perfectly still. "Please don't be dead. *Please please please.*" He shook her gently at first, then more firmly, then urgently. But his sister didn't respond. She didn't move. <nl> Michael picked up Izzy's doll, and placed it into her limp, open hand. Then, he buried his head into her chest and wept. <nl> The cloaked figured slowly got back to its feet. It bent down and picked up its scythe. <nl> "What did you do to her, you- you *monster!*" Michael asked, his voice trembling as he turned to the creature. "She was just a little girl and you-" <nl> He saw her left arm move first. The arm that hadn't moved since the mines. <nl> "*What?* Izzy?" <nl> Her eyes slowly opened. The trace of a smile curved over her lips. <nl> "Izzy!" he repeated through sobs and laughter. "Oh God, Izzy, you're alive. Please - *please,* don't ever do that to me again." He kissed her cheeks a dozen times, and her forehead nearer a hundred, before hugging her tightly. <nl> "He... he made me better," she said, as her brother finally released her, raising her neck and looking up at the creature. <nl> Michael stared anew at the cloaked figure. It looked stronger now. Taller, too. It took Michael a few moments to be able to whisper: "*thank you*." <nl> The creature nodded, before lifting his scythe high into the air. <nl> "What are you..." <nl> The creature brought the instrument down fiercely, tip first, burying it deep into the dry earth. A fountain of clear liquid erupted from the hole as he withdrew it. It didn't take long for a soft blanket of grass to begin sprouting underneath Izzy, quickly spreading out as if it was a puddle of water. It didn't take long for her to find the first tulip that had grown in a hundred years. Then, the first apple tree. <nl> Izzy whispered to her brother and pressed something into his hands. <nl> When the cloaked figure was finally satisfied by the sparkling oasis, he pointed a finger toward Michael and gestured for him to step forward. He did so. <nl> "My sister wanted you to have this," Michael said, offering out a hand. <nl> Death paused for a moment, unsure, before reaching out and taking the doll. He looked at it curiously, turning it over twice. Then, he dropped it into a deep, dark pocket on the side of his cloak. "There are others," he said, in a soft rumble. "Only a few. You must bring them here." <nl> "How - how will I find them?" <nl> "You will," it replied. "She will be safe, here. Nothing evil can step foot into my garden." It turned and took three steps away from him, before pausing. "I will see you again, someday," it whispered, not quite loud enough for Izzy to hear. Then, it continued its slow walk into the dancing dust of the desert. <nl> "Thank you," Michael whispered, as the figure drifted out of sight. <nl> --- <nl> more on /r/nickofnight <eos>

<sos> They packed and left once more. <nl> Dolly sighed as they did it, looking back from the ramp at the gold-green horizon, pierced all through with falling stars, all aflame. The world groaned and hissed. She felt the slateland below her feet shimmy and quake. <nl> Another home lost. <nl> On the ship, she settled into a corner, not helping, a passive protest of the situation. Her mother set a crate at her feet. <nl> "Don't pout. It's the start of another adventure." <nl> Dolly shook off her mother's optimism, diving into the crate. "What's this?" she said, pulling up a binder, corroded, yellow and warped. <nl> "Careful," said her mother. "Those are pictures. Old, old pictures." <nl> "Of *what*?" said Dolly, flipping open the pages. "What are these things? <nl> Dolly's mother laughed, settling in beside her daughter. "It's us. From before." <nl> Dolly shook her head. "No it isn't. This is... I don't know *what* this is. Look how silly they look. How... ugly." <nl> Her mother shrugged. "We didn't think so then." She pointed at an image. "That's me." <nl> Dolly pulled back, staring in disbelief. "No it isn't! Look at the... I mean..." <nl> "This is what we were in the beginning," said Dolly's mother. "Those were perfect bodies for Earth. Slim, light, nimble. Adapted to the atmosphere. I miss those bodies sometimes..." <nl> "What's wrong with *these* bodies?" said Dolly, looking down at herself. <nl> "Nothing! Not a thing. But you must remember we've been so many places, dear. And they were all so different. We've made changes along the way to suit each and every new home. See here..." <nl> She put a gentle finger on the trio of exposed ridges across her daughter's bare chest. "On Calais - you remember Calais? - we formed these slits in order to help us breathe. The old way wouldn't have done. And here..." <nl> She traced the edge of the thin membranous flap that ran along the length of Dolly's forearm. "There was hardly any solid land on Galway. We had to adapt. We're always adapting. Even the bare shape of us. The gravity was much, much harsher on Fulsome. We grew stouter because we had to. The old us would've snapped right in half." <nl> Dolly nodded. She remembered some of these places, and she supposed she remembered some of these changes, but they hadn't felt like changes. Looking back, they seemed a natural progression. "This part looks stupid," she said, resting a finger on the part of the image that showed a flowing, black wave riding down from the top of her mother's head. <nl> Again, her mother laughed. "It was the style. Your father certainly loved my long hair, impractical as it may have been." She touched the silvery, solid webbing that sat like a shield atop her daughter's head. "We could be impractical then, though. The radiation was different. No threat of black flares." She sighed. "I guess things were a bit simpler then." <nl> "Better?" said Dolly. <nl> "No," said her mother, running a loving finger across the outer rim of Dolly's folded wings. "Just different. That's what comes of survival, I suppose. You must always be willing to become." <nl> "Become what?" said Dolly. <nl> Dolly's mother smirked. "Whatever you must." She took back the binder and set it in the crate. "Back to work, dear. This world is no longer ours." <nl> Dolly staggered up to her feet. "I hate living out in the black." <nl> "The black is just an interlude," said Dolly's mother. "It reminds us to appreciate those times when we have solid earth to call our own." <nl> Dolly understood, even if she preferred not to agree. She gathered up the last of her possessions - the ones that would come with them into the black - and said goodbye to her dying home. It was sad, but necessary, she realized. That's just how survival works. <eos>

<sos> The experiment with Ari had perhaps gotten out of hand. If any of Mrs. Palmer's supervisors heard of it, it would be difficult to explain why on earth she found it reasonable to give only one child in her class impossibly difficult tests while the others were quizzed on only the basic classroom curriculum. <nl> The answer would never suffice, despite its truth: *because he would get them all correct*. <nl> Mrs. Palmer's minor case study began when she accidentally listed the Second Punic War as the Carthaginian War on her ninth graders' tests. Every student understandably missed the question--few fourteen-year-olds, it seemed, read the *Aeneid* these days and would place Carthage as an ancient African city--except Ari. He listed the correct dates in his blocky, imperfect handwriting. <nl> She asked him about it later. <nl> Ari only shrugged and said, "I just know a lot of stuff." He looked uncomfortable and scurried away. <nl> Mrs. Palmer then started slipping questions into Ari's tests which none of the children could possibly be expected to answer. Who was involved in the defenestration of Prague? Which Russian ruler died in 1584 under the title "Tsar of all the Russias"? What is the cosine of this triangle? Can you balance this chemical formula? <nl> She almost wanted to accuse him of cheating. But she kept a razor-sharp eye on that boy during tests, and Ari's hands never strayed under the table or into his pockets. He simply filled out his test, handed it in halfway through the period, and then sat with his head on his desk until he was free to go to his next class. <nl> Then she perhaps pushed it too far. <nl> Yesterday, she gave all but one of her students a test on Sophocles's *Oedipus Rex*, which they were reading as a part of their ancient Greek unit. It asked them the basics of the plot and the play's intended messages. <nl> For Ari, his test was more... open-ended. <nl> She left a single sticky note on his test to explain herself: *This,* she wrote, *is not a test of your knowledge but of your critical thinking. You are an excellent student and I know I do not need to test your basic comprehension. Have fun and think clearly.* <nl> Now Mrs. Palmer sat at her desk in her apartment living room with a glass of red wine and a stack of tests before her. She rifled through until she found Ari's near the bottom. Her sticky note still remained on his paper; he had simply written "Okay :)" on the bottom. <nl> She smiled, despite herself. <nl> Mrs. Palmer only gave him four questions. She gave him the choice to answer in the context of the play or to simply derive his answers from his own experiences. Credit was not for the accuracy of his answers but their depth. <nl> *What is good?* <nl> *What is just?* <nl> *What is fate?* <nl> *What is the purpose to life itself?* <nl> Ari hadn't answered any of them. His test page was blank, except for an arrow at the bottom, urging her to turn the paper over. <nl> Mrs. Palmer frowned and did so. On the back she found a dense wall of Ari's sloppy, childish handwriting. She took a deep sip of wine before reading. <nl> *Respectfully, Mrs. P, I think your questions are built up on false assumptions. You're asking for ice when the world is water and air, always moving and mixing. It's a singularly human notion to turn ideas into something condensed, portable, and easy to wrap one's mind around. But it's not honest.* <nl> *You are asking questions which lack answers because the questions themselves are wrongly put. It is not about rigid, inflexible meaning which exists in its own right, waiting to be dissected for an essay question. Purpose and answers arise from our own perceptions. If you think there is no good then all the world will be black and hopeless. If you think an eye for an eye is justice you stumble through your life blind with righteous indignation.* <nl> *But if you care and hope and love, the world is full of small beautiful things, always working together, always persisting against the selfish and chaotic. We can be grotesque and sublime all at once if we never let the former outweigh the latter in our minds.* <nl> *I'm sorry if it's not the answers you wanted Mrs. P, but please don't fail me. I've never failed a test before.* <nl> Mrs. Palmer wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes. She did not know what she had been expecting. There was comfort in the idea that there existed someone who knew all things. Part of her was disappointed that Ari was just another fact-hoarding bookworm. <nl> But it seemed Ari was just as clueless as anyone else when it came to life's truly crippling problems. Or exponentially more brilliant. She had not decided which yet. She only knew she needed another drink. <nl> *** <nl> /r/shoringupfragments <nl> Edit: holy shit thank you I have never been gilded before <eos>

<sos> "Some tea, dear?" the little old lady asked to the dark and mysterious figure sitting at her kitchen table. She squinted at him having forgotten her glasses upstairs. <nl> "Yes, earthling," the mysterious figure boomed and whispered all at once, careful not to burst her delicate eardrums with his natural voice as he had with the last earthling he'd met. <nl> "Call me Grammy," Grammy said, and set about preparing the kettle to boil after setting a plate of cookies on the table. <nl> "Yes, Grammy," the figure corrected himself. "Thank you," he added as a stilted afterthought. <nl> --- <nl> Ryorek typed the word "dear" into his database. <nl> "Dear: an affectionate term referring to one who is figuratively close to the speaker, such as a family member or an old friend." <nl> Ryorek ran his hand through his tendrils and sighed. <nl> "Agent from Earth sector 9 reporting," he whispered into his communicator. "Advise immediate shelving of phase two. I repeat, advise to abort phase two." <nl> The response rang clear over the comm channel: "Report received, agent. Mission briefing in two cycles." <nl> "Acknowledged." <nl> "Did you say something, dear?" Grammy asked, turning toward him with a pleasant smile on her old and weathered face. <nl> "Not at all, Grammy," Ryorek said. "Thank you for the cookies." <eos>

<sos> The faceless man without a name sat down on the sidewalk, shaking a jug of coins at the bypassing people. He didn't have a name or face because this story took place in a world without a proper setting or forethought, words were scarce and descriptions suffered in turn. The only things that existed were his immense fortune somewhere out in the ether, and the busy street, which was the scene of the story. <nl> Not too surprisingly, a stranger walked up to the man. Let's call her Betty, I mean, who really cares about her name. What matters is that Betty was a struggling single mother. She was several months behind on her rent, and her landlord was evicting her. She also had a daughter that was very ill - chronically so - and didn't have money for proper treatment. <nl> Seeing the poor man on the street, dressed in nothing but rags, made her stop. No matter how rough things got, there were always people who had it worse. She was just about to give him her last spare change, when something unbelievable happened - something that wasn't in the script. The woman noticed the grubby child sitting next to the man. <nl> Now a new dilemma presented itself to Betty. She had her arm stretched out and ready to drop the coin into the jug of the poor man, but she hesitated. The homeless child probably needed the money more than the man. Could she change her mind in this situation? Was that the right thing to do? The expression of mixed happiness and surprise on the man's face made her heart ache. What would she see in his gray eyes if she pulled her hand back? Disappointment? Hatred? <nl> Her eyes wandered to the dime in her hand. Could she ask the beggar if he could change it for two nickels so that she could give them one each? That seemed very out of line to Betty. <nl> "Just drop it in mine," the man said with a look at the child. "He'll be better off from it as well." <nl> Betty was a bit taken aback by the bold statement. It was such a blunt thing to say. How would the child be better off if she gave the money to the man? That seemed like such a messed up idea - the child was clearly starving. <nl> "I, uh, I..." Betty said and finally pulled her hand back. <nl> The man shook his head at her, and Betty sniffed. She dropped the coin into the open palm of the child and hurried off. The problem with this course of action, even though it seemed morally right to Betty, was that the rich man disguised as a poor man still hadn't received help. <nl> Now, if the man had been a proper character with a bit of depth, he would've realized that the woman was a good person anyway, and hurried after her to give her his fortune. I mean, why did it have to be to him in the first place? If someone gave a starving child money, wouldn't they be deserving of the fairytale ending in this scenario? If the man had any sense of morality, he wouldn't be out on the streets playing games to see who gets his fortune. He would've helped all the homeless children in the city. He would've distributed food and helped people out of the gutter. <nl> But since this is not a proper setting or characterization, just a random scene with a made up scenario, another stranger walked by. This was Michael Foroza, a crime lord that preyed upon the weak and exploited those with good intentions. He was the man who was evicting Betty and her sick child. And while digging through his pocket for his phone to call in another hit on an innocent person, a random coin dropped out and accidentally landed in the homeless man's jug. <nl> **** <nl> r/Lilwa_Dexel <eos>

<sos> "What brings you here little one?" <nl> An old man wrapped in ratty clothes stared at the young girl who was teary eyed and clearly lost. She was about seven with big blue eyes and a mass of dark blonde hair. Her clothes were worn but clean and had been mended. The pink back pack and matching lunch box looked new. <nl> "My momma and I were walking to school when a big crowd separated us and now I can't find her. My name is Sylvia. Can you help me find my momma?" The man's heart nearly melted at her request. "How about I take you to the police station. They can find your mom." He replied. He grabbed her hand as his stomach growled loudly. Sylvia looked up at him and sniffled. <nl> "Are you hungry sir? I can share my lunch with you." <nl> "I couldn't take your food Sylvia. You need it for school." <nl> "Momma packed two sandwiches in case I have a classmate who doesn't have a lunch. You're not a classmate but you don't have a sandwich." <nl> She dug around her little lunchbox and pulled out a turkey sandwich with cheese and a juice box. Smiling, she handed it to the old man. He was touched. After spending weeks on the street waiting for someone to show him some kindness, a little girl put them to shame by offering a sandwich. He took the sandwich and juice with a word of thanks and bit into it. <nl> "Thank you my dear. You are very kind at such a young age." <nl> "Momma has always taught me to be kind to others. She always keeps snacks and stuff in her car or bag for people in need." <nl> "Wise words to live by." <nl> He finished the sandwich and juice and was about to start the walk to the police department when he heard tearful and frantic yelling. A young woman in neat but worn clothing came running down the street calling Sylvia's name. The man got her attention and the woman came to the duo. <nl> "Sylvia! My sweet baby. I was so scared that I lost you! Are you okay?" The emotions in her voice showed that she was truly worried about her child. <nl> "I'm fine momma. This nice man was going to help me find you. Momma please quit squishing me." <nl> The mother laughed and let the girl go. She then stood up and turned her attention to the old man that stood watching. <nl> "How can I ever repay you sir?" <nl> "You already have. Now it is my turn to repay you." <eos>

<sos> "You live like this?" The burgler asked, gently waking me up. <nl> I opened my eyes and stared at the ceiling.  "Yeah." <nl> She walked across the room and started rummaging through my dresser.  Casually dropping socks and some receipts on the floor.  I wasn't sure why the receipts were in there, I hadn't bought anything in years. <nl> She muttered.  "Bunch of crap, nothing worth taking." <nl> I sighed and sat up, sliding my legs off the bed and onto the dog.  He snorted and rolled over.  Useless damn thing.  Just lets someone walk into my room.  I rubbed his belly with my bare foot.  His tongue lolled out the side of his pug face.  He snorted again contentedly. <nl> "What are you looking for?" <nl> She looked over her shoulder and glared at me before answering.  "Dunno, something worth taking I guess." <nl> "Take this shitty dog, he's worthless." <nl> I got up and headed to the kitchen, she continued to rummage around in my room.  I made coffee.  The dumb dog followed me and headed to his bowl.  Stupid thing is always hungry.  I ignored it, didn't have anything for him anyway. <nl> The day was grey with a slight drizzle, but it was bright enough I could see my way around.  I left the light off, figured the burglar would prefer that.  Something crashed and broke in the bathroom.  I grabbed the coffee off the machine and took a careful sip.  Stuffs hot right when it comes off the machine. <nl> "What the hell are you doing?  Breaking my bathroom up?" <nl> I leaned around the corner and peered down the hall, a shadow moved there, she had turned on the bathroom light.  Some burglar.  Loud as hell and now turning on lights. <nl> Her head poked through the bathroom door.  She was pretty, if a bit angular and gawky.  She sneered which made her much less pretty. <nl> "Maybe.  Maybe I'll break you up too and take everything". <nl> I chuckled and that seemed to irritate her more.  Then I laughed out loud and the dog trotted over and sat in the hallway looking at her, and then at me.  She glared at us both.  I shrugged and went back in the kitchen, the dog did whatever dogs do when you aren't looking at them.  She cursed and I heard her coming down the hall. <nl> She walked in the kitchen with the dog in tow.  "I smell coffee." <nl> "Yeah, I can't function without it, robbery or no, it's hard to deal with the mornings until I have some." <nl> She looked through the refrigerator.  "Bloody hell, what's in this Tupperware?" <nl> I looked up from my coffee, French Roast, it was delicious.  "Who knows, I haven't opened that thing up in months." <nl> The burglar put it back quickly and closed the door.  She seemed defeated and sat heavily on the only other chair in the kitchen.  I considered telling her it only had three of its four legs.  But hey, she was trying to rob me, let her figure it out.  The result was predictable, she went down in a heap, flat on her back.  The chair now had one and a half legs.  It startled the dog who had laid down under the table.  Moronic thing jumped up and walked over to where she lay, staring at the ceiling, and started licking her face. <nl> I leaned over and peered down at her, steaming cup of coffee in my hand. <nl> "You live like this?" <nl> "Yeah" she said, staring at the ceiling. <eos>

<sos> Her stomach growled aggressively as she pushed past the crest of the hill, leaning heavily on the metal stick she carried in one hand. For a second, her eyes lit up with expectation before turning ash gray once more. The sand stretched out for miles, the sight of great buildings on the horizon the only thing convincing her the sands did not simply continue forever. She sighed heavily, her hot breath starting to fog up her goggles, as she began her methodical descent down the hill. The earth was hard and dense as her boots struggled to dig into it, forcing her to spend several seconds for every step, making sure she wouldn't fall again. It was slow and grueling, but she eventually made it down, sinking shallowly into the cold sand. <nl> She found herself missing the hard stone of her homeland, something she never thought she would say. It was tough and cold, but at the very least it was reliable, something she desperately wished for as the winds kicked up whatever stray sand had not already frozen in place. Digging her face deeper into her collar, she started making her way toward the lone skeleton of a building in front of her, buried halfway into the sands. <nl> Stepping behind a large concrete wall shielding her from the wind, she pressed her back against it and slid down into a sitting position with a sigh. She had traded her last Potato for this information, but feeling warmth finally return to her face made it feel more than worth it. She sat there for a while, resting, and trying to warm herself up a bit. But most importantly she was trying to stay awake. She had seen many people stronger than her, succumb to the sleeping death of the desert and was not about to make the same mistake. No matter how heavy her eyes felt. <nl> She jolted awake, not knowing if she had been sleeping for two hours or two seconds, and terrified of both scenarios. She attempted to slow her breathing, looking around the broken room for something to focus on. In one corner was lay the bones of some man or beast that had at one point had the same idea as her, perhaps foreshadowing her own demise. Another corner was charred as if by fire and it made her long for the warm fires she had left to continue her travels. And lastly, in the corner directly to her right, there was some piece of scrap metal sticking out of the sand. She stared at it, wondering what it could have been for. Maybe a skyscraper that reached high into the clouds, or a ship that could ferry her out into the abyss. <nl> She jolted again, this time catching herself before her eyes had fully closed, and begrudgingly pushed herself off the ground. Joints aching violently, she made her way over to the scrap metal, thankful for the boost that even just walking gave her concentration. It looked strange when you were this close to it, less like scrap and more like a container, perhaps containing something of value? It took her maybe ten minutes to dig out the case enough for her to remove it with brute force. It wasn't that large, maybe 15 inches across, and she couldn't spot any kind of physical lock. <nl> Flipping the case open, there was a matt black rectangle sitting snugly inside the padding, accompanied by a much smaller rectangle attached to its side. Carefully removing the rectangle from its casing she found that it opened up to reveal a keyboard underneath, letters she didn't recognize mixed in with familiar symbols. It was a computer and, as she found out from the lights turning on in unison, a working one. As the operating system flashed onto the screen she chuckled to herself about how long ago it must have been when this was made. <nl> There were three profiles, one had a picture of a suitcase, one had a picture of a painting, and one had a picture of a robot action figure. Clicking on the suitcase she was taken to a white page with black text. Of course, she couldn't read any of it, but there were still some pictures around. On one side she noticed that there were a lot of different symbols forming similar words, and tried looking for her own language, but to no avail. Instead, she just clicked around using an antiquated trackpad, marveling at some of the images. <nl> Eventually, she got to a page that that had an image of a field. But it was not like any field she had ever seen. It was lush and green, flowers of different colors adorning the grass that almost swayed before her very eyes. It wasn't there to feed anyone, wasn't there to be built upon. It just existed, beautiful and green, right there on the page. And she cried as it all faded to black and the batteries gave out, leaving behind a girl freezing in the desert, alone. <eos>

<sos> "What about the public?" Musk said. "I've always been open about things." <nl> Roland Luccio sucked on his lower lip intensely and looked at the founder of SpaceX, and then over at Sapphira, who sighed and shook her head. <nl> "The public is not ready for something like this," Roland said. <nl> "How are we supposed to fund a journey like this in secret? Alpha Canis Majoris is 2.6 parsecs away-that's, uh, over eight light years." <nl> Sapphira finally rose from her seat and hurried over to the screen. With a few quick sweeps and taps of her fingers, she drew up the plans for the project. When she first started studying marine biology, she never thought she'd be working on something like this. Two of the world's most powerful men relied directly on her for a project that would cost... she didn't even want to think about the numbers. <nl> A solar system popped up on the screen. The white main-sequence star of spectral type at the center, known as Sirius A, was twice as large as our own sun. The system around it looked very different, as well, with another star, a white dwarf called Sirius B, orbiting the center of the system. NASA had spent the last year trying to gather as much information about the system as possible, and nearly all resources had been funneled into the project. Strings had even been pulled with the government, and part of the military funding now went straight into NASA's pocket. <nl> The model of the solar system on the screen shifted and zoomed in on a bright blue planet. After decoding the whale song, Sapphira had spent many nights awake, thinking about the implications. She had always thought about night sky's reflection in the sea-the only mirror able to hold the universe on its shiny surface-and it didn't feel all too strange that some of the creatures living there would somehow be connected to vast expanses of space. <nl> "So, that's where we're going?" Musk said and rose from his seat as well. <nl> "I take it you're interested then," Roland said and joined the other two. <nl> "Of course, I just wish you'd told me sooner." <nl> The two men shook hands, and Roland's lips turned into a smile of relief. Getting Elon Musk and SpaceX on board was crucial and had likely been a significant stress factor to the old NASA director for quite some time now. Their technology on rapid space travel would be crucial for this expedition. <nl> "I'm happy you've decided to join us, let's set up the meetings as soon as possible." <nl> Musk nodded. "I just have one question: who'll be the head of this mission? Who will lead the expedition?" <nl> Roland threw out his wrinkly hand and sat back down in the armchair. "My number one pick would be Dr. Sapphira Lake over there." <nl> Sapphira's eyes went wide. "B-but I don't have any astronaut training; I'm just-" <nl> "Of course," Musk cut her off excitedly, "the person who discovered the whole thing in the first place. A fine choice!" <nl> Sapphira's heart was racing now. She'd never been out of the country before, and she felt like there must be hundreds, if not thousands, of people more qualified than her. She thought about her cat, Noodle, and wondered who'd take care of him if she left for... another solar system. <nl> "What do you say, Sapphira?" Roland said. <nl> She swallowed and took a deep breath. Was she ready for this? What would her mother say? She played the scenario in her head: 'Hey, Mom, I'm going to Sirius for a bit-don't expect me back before Christmas.' The look on her mother's face would be a combination of pride and sadness. <nl> On a mission like this... well, she wouldn't be returning to Earth, that much was certain. Still, the discovery of the meaning behind the whale song made her shiver. She had to go. <nl> "I'd be honored," she said and bowed slightly. <nl> "Then it's settled!" Roland said. "You can start picking out your team, Sapphira - Mr. Musk, let's continue our talk in private-I have a few propositions I'd like to run by you." <nl> The two men left the room, and Sapphira found her eyes wandering to the massive clock that adorned the wall. One year and two days left to launch. She was about to leave Earth forever-the thought was dizzying-and the journey there would take so long... she'd be close to forty when they finally reached Alpha Canis Majoris. She couldn't quite wrap her head around it. She was nineteen now, and by the end of the journey, she would've spent more time on board that space ship than on Earth. <nl> Still shaky from the unexpected news, Sapphira turned off the computer and plugged her earphones in. The shrill but soft sounds, echoing through the ocean filled her mind. The song was beautiful and sad-emotions that perfectly portrayed the meanings behind it. <nl> **** <nl> [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lilwa_Dexel/comments/6w4j6y/the_song_of_sirius_part_2/) <nl> r/Lilwa_Dexel for more. <eos>

<sos> Once upon a time there was a woman living in a dingy, lonely and busted up bungalow. She woke up one morning feeling as shameful as ever, but something was... different. She felt a little less lonely than usual, as if she was sharing the house with a close and trustworthy friend. She went to the kitchen to fix herself something along the line of breakfast. She opened the cereal cupboard, expecting her usual stale and tasteless dehydrated oats; however, in its place was pancake mix and healthy, albeit sugary, cereal! <nl> She was astounded, no, bewildered to find this. She danced around the kitchen, then stopped, the colour in her face draining. She realized that somebody would have needed to have broken into her house, noticed her situation, gone shopping and then put the products in her cupboard. She thought about calling the police, but decided to hold back from doing so, doubting anybody would believe her. She got the pancake mix and added water from her tap and made a breakfast she had never imagined she could have ever gotten to eat. Although she could taste the dirt from the tap water, she was unfazed. <nl> After brekfast, she went to take a shower, and saw some good old, white and cleaning soap on the rest thing in her shower. "Thats fucking weird" she said. "Not only did I have pancake mix for me but now soap?" Now she was starting to feel uncomfortale. She smelled the soap. Although pungent, it reminded her of the soap in her grandmother's bathroom when she lived with her during her teen years. She wetted it in her sink and scrubbed it on her left palm, then washed it off, some of the dirt on her hand had already washed off! <nl> She got in the fuckin showr and got herself clean. She said to herself "wow, I wonder who got me this, it's like I have a gardian angel or somethin. After getting out of the shower she saw some white guy in her mirror. "Hello?" she asked. The angel replied to her "hello my child. I have been sent by God to protect and care for you." <nl> Holy fuckin shit can you belive this? She got agoddamb angle savin her and shit! The angel dude got out of the mirror and held her hand. "Dont touch me you weirdo" said the girl, cuz its clearly not the fuckin angel talking, now is it? He helped her get dressed. It's a guy angel, okay? Why, you ask? Cuz I said so! The angel walkd her out of the bathroom and they watched tv. <nl> Dam sad the angel. You got some good shows on here. The girl and angel watched the tv for a bit. God, what an I doing with my life? A girl and angle watchng tv? Why did I even start writing this! You know what, fuck it! I'm gonna go take a nap... <eos>

<sos> "I just don't see why it has to have holes everywhere." Mira gestured at the gap in the middle of the platemail. "Won't I get stabbed in the stomach?" <nl> "Oh, no. You see, our armor is very high level. It gives +15 resistance against piercing. That's much better than the iron plate you picked up off the bandit's hideout," I explained, throwing a dagger at the stomach-hole. It bounced off. "Materials are short, so the holes are necessary. We made sure to put them in areas where they'd keep you properly ventilated." <nl> A man in a loincloth shoved Mira aside and slammed his hands on the counter. "SPEEDRUN!" He shouted, and I scrambled to bring out a bag of standard gear. He grabbed half of it, tossed his entire coin pouch on the table, and ran outside before Mira could get up. <nl> "Sorry about that. Anyway, if you're concerned about the safety of this piece, we have many others available for your selection." I pointed at the displays on the wall. <nl> "Isn't that one just lingerie?" Mira asked, pointing at the far left stand with a golden pedestal. <nl> "Don't worry about that one, it costs premium currency and doesn't provide any armor. So yeah, it basically is just lingerie. We sell it too. Well, if you're looking for something a little better covered, our Nightress set doesn't have any holes." Mira examined the set of pitch black medium armor. <nl> "It's a little better, but why does it have boobs? Won't I fracture my sternum if I fall over? You sure I can't just wear male armor?" I sighed and brought out a set of male armor. <nl> "Well, if you insist, you can try this. It's the standard male counterpart for your level, though it might feel a bit uncomfortable. 4000 gold." I set it on the counter. <nl> "It's pretty expensive, but oh well. Whatever lets me keep my dignity." Mira fished around in her pouch. "Damn, I'm only at 3800. Let me sell some equipment really quick." <nl> She slid her money, her sword, her boots, her pants, and her bandit plate mail across the counter and walked out completely naked carrying the male armor. <nl> _________________________________________________ <nl> [more](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tensingstories/) <eos>

<sos> The rowdy crowd rabbled. They rabbled in a rowdier manner than any rowdy crowd had rabbled before. <nl> "Order! Order within this hall!" shouted Mr. Hanner, the mayor of Stubbornsville. His voice reverberating around the rickety old hall. <nl> The gathered crowd was a ragtag bunch. Mainly dressed in old potato bags, mud, and, in some cases, old potato bags made of mud. They were also difficult to control and were prone to mob fever. But the rowdiness was quickly put to bed when the doors to the hall burst open. <nl> A woman, atop of the tallest horse the villagers had ever seen, entered and slowly trotted towards the front of the hall stopping just short of  the stage. The lady unseated and descended from her high horse, slowly walking up the steps to the front of the stage. <nl> "Greetings, peasants," said the lady, lifting her arms aloft to greet the crown in a demeaning manner. "I come from the future and I'm here to tell you just how much better I am than you." <nl> The crowd didn't react. They just looked on confused. <nl> "Thought the whole future thing would have got a bigger reaction but let's move on," said the woman, pacing around the stage. "How can I be a superior person just like you, I hear you ask. Well, I have one word for you: Veganism," said the woman, in an incredibly condescending and preachy tone. <nl> "Are you the person who has been putting all those pictures of gross dead animals on the bulletin board?" asked one of the gathered peasants. "The pictures with the words on top and bottom." <nl> "Yes, that was I," announced the lady, clearly proud of the fact. "I assume this has already converted hundreds of you to my way of thinking as it is a fool-proof strategy in the year 2017." <nl> "The pictures on the bulletin board worked on me," admitted Maureen, fourth row middle of the isle, wearing a muddy potato sack. "I could only stomach half of my dog after seeing one of the pictures." <nl> The lady looked towards the Mayor, "Wait, why are your people eating dogs?" <nl> "Why are you eating your dogs, Maureen?" asked the Mayor, looking to get to the bottom of this case. <nl> "The dog was organic if that makes a difference," said Maureen. <nl> "No," said the lady. "No that does not make a difference." <nl> "Are cats OK to eat if your veganism?" another voice queried from the crowd. "I tend to eat cats." <nl> "He really does eat a lot of cats," added the Mayor. <nl> "No. Why would cats be OK if dogs are not? Veganism is about not eating any meat at all thus making you a superior person," explained the woman. <nl> "I don't understand," shouted a voice from the crowd. <nl> "What part do you not understand?" asked the vegan lady. <nl> The peasant woman in the crowd stood up, "I don't understand how not eating meat makes you a better person." <nl> "Humans do not need to consume meat," explained the vegan lady. "And by not eating meat, animals get to live free from cages allowing people like me to feel smug and better than others." <nl> "Can we eat animal if they are eating us?" asked the peasant lady who was still standing. "A bear stole my child. He knocked at door pretending to be kind neighbour. But it was all lie. A dirty bear lie." <nl> "There's just no way that's true," said the woman on stage. <nl> "I'm afraid it's true. It was easily a top 5 case of child being eaten by a cunning bear," said the Mayor, following up. "Some actually said top 3 but it was never agreed upon." <nl> "Listen, we're getting off track here, the idea is to not eat any animals under any circumstance. That is what separates us vegans from those who are quite clearly below us." <nl> "Are there any other ways we can feel superior to others while still eating meat?" asked the Mayor. "I just don't feel like veganism is going to work in this village." <nl> The lady on stage began to pace, deep in thought. "The issue is, it's difficult to be smugger than being vegan but there is something else. By a show of hands, how many of you exercise?" <nl> Around twenty hands went up in to the air. <nl> "So about a quarter of you exercise. That's good. Now, how many of you make sure you tell others about your exercising?" <nl> Every hand fell back down. <nl> "You see," said the lady, "how do you expect to feel better than others if you're not obnoxiously showing everyone how much better than them you are?" <nl> "My name Boris. I feel better after run," said Boris, shouting from the back. <nl> "Come on up, Boris," said the vegan lady, with Boris obliging. "When did you go on your run?" <nl> "Today," replied Boris. <nl> "And how many people are aware you went on your run?" <nl> "Zero." <nl> "Boris, what is the point of improving yourself if you aren't forcing it down the throats of people who aren't bothered? You're missing a key element of being better than everyone else. Take this piece of paper and write 'Wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't get out and run every day. Attack the day!'" <nl> Boris wrote the message. <nl> "Now pin it to that wall over there." <nl> Boris walked over to the wall in the hall next to the stage and pinned up the message. <nl> "Everyone look at that message," shouted the lady. <nl> Everyone turned to view the message. <nl> "Now, Boris, how do you feel knowing all of these people now know you went on your run?" <nl> Boris looked at the crowd viewing his message, "It makes me feel above them." <nl> "That's it!" shouted the lady, "This is what I'm telling you. It's not the exercise, the unwillingness to eat meat, or the genuine efforts to improve yourself that's important; it's letting other people know you're better than them that is the key." <nl> "I get it!" shouted a familiar voice from the crowd. "So all I have to do is let other people know I have eaten their dog." <nl> **** <nl> I write shitty, silly stories on /r/BillMurrayMovies. Feel free to come along, not laugh at any of them and leave some judgement. <eos>

<sos> "All in favour of sparing her life, step forward!" <nl> I looked around the village square, but no one moved a muscle. The seconds rolled by, and the hope I held in my heart crumbled, only to be replaced by a sharp tang of bitterness, resentment. There was Peter, whose fever had yielded to her medicine, but he kept his eyes down, lips tightly pursed. I saw Nathan too, whose son may never have returned from his ventures into the forests if she had not tracked the child down, but he was as silent, unmoving as Peter was. <nl> Old Man Bosworth, the twins Jaina and Jerry, Valerie, Daniel... they too, everyone who had ever benefited in one way or the other from her help, all suddenly bereft of courage, unwilling to stand up for their benefactor. <nl> The bloody ingrates. <nl> "Do you see how everyone fears you, woman?" asked Chief Lanson, shaking his staff at the figure kneeling on the ground, hands tied behind her. "We tolerated you, gave you a place to call home, and this is how you repay us? By bringing this evil magic into our village?" <nl> "I am not evil," Matilda said, her voice carrying to the edges of the crowd. "I have done no harm to the village. I have only helped." <nl> "Helped? Helped?" said Chief Lanson, his voice rising in anger. He turned to the crowd, stretched out his arms, then said, "Evil fears the light, foul creature. I shall show the village proof, proof of your heresy! I will show them the forbidden evils we found in your hut! Come, show them!" <nl> Fred and Richard, two of the strongest farmers in the village, retrieved a wooden chest from within Chief Lanson's hut. They struggled even though the load was shared between them, and after they placed the evidence in front of Matilda, they took hurried steps backwards, leaving Chief Lanson the honour of opening the chest. <nl> He rummaged briefly, then retrieved what appeared to be a marble slate, dark and smooth on one side, white and pristine on the other. He held it triumphantly in the air, revelling in the reactions he was getting. <nl> "Has anyone ever seen a rock like this?" he asked. "I promise you, no one has!" <nl> "It's not right of you to have gone into my hut like that," said Matilda. <nl> "Oh? And if we had not done so, if we had not suspected you of carrying out the dark one's work, would we ever have discovered foul things such as this?" <nl> "I don't know what you are talking abou- " <nl> Chief Lanson squeezed the edges of the slate, and one side of it flared to life, emitting vibrant colours, as if someone had managed to trap a rainbow in stone. The crowd gasped, and I saw some of the adults shielding their children's eyes. <nl> "If we had not been suspicious, if we had not known to spy on you, would we have discovered your secrets, witch?" said Chief Lanson. He turned the slate towards us, then said, "Listen! Listen with your own ears! This is her! The devil masquerading as a human! Listen to the unholy mission she is on!" <nl> He needn't have commanded us in that manner. We were enraptured, spellbound by the moving images on the slate, of what appeared to a... doppelganger of Matilda, staring out at us, speaking to us. I heard whispers rise up, words like "impossible", "there's two of her", "a soul, trapped in marble". <nl> We fell silent though, once the Slate-Matilda began speaking. <nl> "42nd entry - no new developments in weeks. The search goes on," Slate-Matilda said. Her unruly hair was tied back, and there was a steadiness to her voice, a clarity to her eyes which wasn't usually there. This was not the Matilda we knew, the soft-minded, chattering and hyperactive Matilda we saw roaming the village from morning to night. <nl> It began to dawn on me that it was all an act. <nl> "I don't understand!" said Slate-Matilda, throwing up her hands. "The historical records are clear! The Influencer came from these parts, and I have narrowed it down to this village! I did not travel this far back in time in vain! Yet... yet I have met with all of them, talked to each and every one, but no one, no one stands out! I have run my tests, checked my equipment over and over, but still, not a single one displays even a modicum of psychic powe-" <nl> "And these are the witch's tools, by her own admission!" yelled Chief Lanson. He kicked the chest over, and its contents spilled across the ground, next to Matilda. An excited hum rose amongst the crowds as they feasted their eyes on the unnatural objects, the shiny, glinty collection of baubles created by the devil's own hands. <nl> "Answer me!" Chief Lanson continued, striking his staff into the ground for emphasis. "Tell me why I should not have you burned here, right where you are!" <nl> Matilda raised her head, stared straight at the crowd. Most of them still had the decency to shuffle and squirm, but still no one intervened. <nl> "I have done no harm to anyone," said Matilda. "It is true, I kept secret the real reason why I was here, and I did not tell anyone why it is that I know what I know. But I have only meant well. I have shared my medicines, I have imparted my knowledge... I only asked for a bit of solace as I conducted my research. I meant no harm." <nl> "Enough! Stop your lies, right this instant!" Chief Lanson said. He struck with his staff, hitting Matilda on the shoulder. I saw her tumble forwards, her forehead striking the ground. <nl> "To me! Bring the torches! We will burn her where she is!" <nl> Fred and Richard complied, and as they inched towards Matilda, torches in hand, blank expressions on their faces, I waited again, hoping someone would do something, anything. <nl> I pulled on the sleeves of those around me, begging them to step forward. <nl> But they shrugged me off, transfixed. No one was going to listen to a boy who was still too young to shave. More importantly, no one was going to listen to their hearts, their consciences. <nl> I heard Matilda cry out, though from pain or fear I was not sure. The torch was inches away, but Matilda could not twist free, as tight as her bonds were. <nl> I grit my teeth, then did a quick headcount. Two dozen, maybe more. There were children too, and if I had more time I would have thought twice about whether they were as sturdy as the adults, whether they could recover as quickly. <nl> But I was out of time, and so I stepped forward, clenched my eyes, focused on a single word, and poured every shred of energy I had into it. I had never exerted myself so much before. <nl> *SLEEP* <nl> I knew it had worked when I heard the steady thuds of comatose bodies hitting the floor. I opened my eyes, and I saw that some of Matilda's other possessions on the ground had lighted up, flashing an incandescent array of colours. I pushed past the crowd, pulled Matilda up, shifted her weight onto me. She struggled to keep her eyes open. <nl> "I... I was right..." she said, smiling. "It... it is real..." <nl> "Later," I said. "We have to go, now. There's a lot we have to talk about." <nl> To better cope with Matilda's weight, I borrowed Chief Lanson's staff. From the way he was sleeping peacefully on the ground, it didn't seem like he needed it. <nl> --- <nl> /r/rarelyfunny <eos>

I doubt that very much." <nl> "She could be playing dumb to throw us off, so we don't suspect." <nl> "We are talking about the daft old lady who'll give you vegetables if you dump your chamber pot in that thing behind her house. That one, right?" <nl> "She does have the best vegetables in the county. Could be she needs it for her gardening spells." <nl> "The same lady who gave a shilling for a every dead rat you could bring her then burned all the rats?" <nl> "We were the only village that didn't get the plague. Sounds like a sacrifice to me. And, I'm pretty sure she cursed the barber." <nl> "Cursed the barber?" <nl> "Yeah, my mum says that years ago Mad Mary and he got in an argument 'cause her kid's humours were all out of <nl> balance and he wanted to bleed the tyke. The kid died. Ever since then, he loses more patients than he saves." <nl> "Well, you've convinced me. I guess we've got to burn her, then?" <nl> "I don't see anything else we can do.

<sos> Leslie pushed a lock of hair from her eyes as she leaned sheepishly against the doorway and looked lovingly at the back of her husband's head. He, in turn, was looking at the television. <nl> It was one in the morning on a Wednesday, and they were in a swanky hotel suite. In another context, this could almost have been romantic, she thought. <nl> She shuffled aside as a face with a lanyard ID pushed past her into the room, joining the throng. There were at least two dozen people in there, but she felt there was a special glow around her husband, the lighting seemed to pick him out, draw the eye. Or maybe it was just her imagination. <nl> He was minutes away from being elected the President of the United States. <nl> Downstairs, there was a ballroom full of waiting devotees, balloons poised to drop. They were in Denver, Colorado. <nl> She was trying not to pay attention to the results, but it was impossible not to hear certain things. <nl> "Mr Governor, our numbers are the same as the network's," an aide was saying to him, though his eyes never left the screen. "Colorado is much closer than we thought." <nl> Their home state. It was supposed to secure their Electoral College strategy, but it was failing them. Without it, her husband's campaign was over. <nl> Leslie felt her heart racing. How could this have happened? All the east coast states had gone the way they'd predicted. Something sickly was congealing in her stomach, a strange and irrational certainty that this was her fault. She knew she had done everything in her power to help the campaign, but still...a memory kept playing in her mind. <nl> It was the night before. She had just spoken at a rally in Boulder - the last of the campaign. And then she had gone for dinner with an old friend. Jason. She had know him since high school, and he had reached out. He had always been a strange one; she still could not say what it was that had compelled her to accept his invitation that evening. <nl> "You look tired, Leslie," he had said, over appetizers. "This last year must have been hard on you." <nl> She thought over the endless busses and planes, the incessant press scrutiny of every aspect of their lives, the total lack of intimacy. <nl> "It's been a trip, that's for sure!" she said, attempting a good-natured chuckle. Jason stared at her. <nl> "I like to help people, Leslie, you know that. I want to know what I can do for you." <nl> "Oh, well at this point there's not much-" <nl> "I don't mean on the campaign. I mean, personally: what do you need? After it's all over tomorrow night, what do you want from life?" <nl> He was looking at her strangely. Sincerity, she thought. He was thick with it. He was more sincere than anyone she had ever met. <nl> "Uh, that's kind of you, Jason," she said. She realised her lip was quivering. <nl> "Leslie," he said, leaning forward. Eyes so full of pity. "Are you happy?" <nl> She couldn't stop it. Tears rolled down her cheeks. She tried to dab them away, but it was hopeless. She forced herself to breathe deeply. <nl> "I haven't been happy since my husband won the race for governor," she said, when she had regained control. "I hate it, that's the truth. I hate politics. I wish with all my heart he had stayed in law." She inhaled again and tried to smile. "I haven't told anyone that. Gosh. You can't repeat it, please promise." <nl> Jason leaned back, still full of sympathy. "I promise, and I understand. It must be unimaginably hard for you." <nl> She smiled again. He was looking at the ceiling - now it was Jason who was taking a deep breath. He looked back at her. <nl> "OK," he said, "I can help you. I can make it alright. I have ...some favours I can call in." <nl> "What are you talking about?" she said. He was standing up, paying the bill. She felt horrendously flustered. <nl> "I'm talking about helping you, my friend. Don't worry about a thing." <nl> He turned back to look at her from the door. "Remember," he laughed, "You owe me!" <nl> That was last night. Now she was was in a room that had just gone very quiet. A news anchor, full of his own importance, had just called Colorado for the opposition. <nl> "It's a shock result, let me tell you," a pundit was saying. "We're seeing a polling failure like nowhere else in the country. The state was always going to be close but there seems to have been a last minute swing of about 10,000 votes, mainly in the Boulder area, that handed it to the incumbent." <eos>

<sos> The line behind Wes was growing as he sifted through pages of words on a computerized booth. Each word was followed by a price tag that reflected its complexity. <nl> "Hurry. You, hurry, please," demanded a man in a custodian gear that stood behind him. "Go. Go." The numerous people in the queue all seemed to nod in agreement. <nl> Wes had no words to reassure them that he was moving as fast as he could, so he remained silent and focused. <nl> The Department of Speech Permission, or DSP, was the government office in charge of selling word licenses to the public. For a citizen to be able to speak or write a word, the citizen must first purchase the right to use that word from this office. The DSP also had the power to set the prices. Depending on simplicity, utility or other unnamed factors, a word's price could be relatively inexpensive. Other words could be so expensive that people often choose to buy a limited number of uses. <nl> A lady in the back, dressed in a white button top, pencil skirt and black pumps yelled out, "Come on! We all have things to do." <nl> Wes couldn't help but notice how flippantly she used so many wide-utility words. She must have bought them all for unlimited use. Despite that, however, Wes knew that she was poor as well. If she were actually wealthy, she would be in the Expedited Service Section of the DSP. <nl> He was right, of course. The woman was one of the many working class that bought into the notion that you have to fake it to make it. She had spent all her savings and put herself into debt in order to keep conversation with upper management. "Just pick one! I have to get to work!" She had gotten so good at bluffing her vocabulary that people rarely notice she only used one-syllable words. Unfortunately, she was unaware her bosses had noticed and mocked her behind closed doors. <nl> Wes motioned to her as well. He had no words for her either. <nl> But not for long. Wes finally found the word for which he had been saving on his lowly salary. A bright warning prompt flashed on screen. "Unlimited?" it asked. Yes. "Are you sure?" it warned one last time. Yes. <nl> Wes basked at his profile on the computer screen. It now read: <nl> > **Wesley Thorne** <nl> Sex: Male <nl> Age: 36 <nl> Total Vocabulary: 1 <nl> Accessible Words: "Revolution" (unlimited) <eos>

<sos> I almost didn't recognize her when she walked in. Age will do that to a person. I've said for years that men stop aging at twenty-five and don't change one bit except for weight until they reach almost fifty. Women however evolve. It's impossible to guess how old a lady is. Only if she is younger or older than you. <nl> That was the problem I had with her. The first time I met her, she was older than me by at least twenty years. That was two decades ago, almost to the day. Today... she was younger. Hell, I don't think she was allowed in normal bars. Not that I ever carded anyone. If you could find The Happy Hour, I'd serve you. <nl> She came up to the bar and asked if the manager was about.  I blinked twice before telling her no. Then she asked about the owner. It took me a second to realize, this her hadn't been here yet. <nl> Fucking timeloops. <nl> I told her the owner wasn't in, but I could probably help. She sighed and said she was looking for a job. She was stranded and needed to get back on her feet. <nl> I asked if she had any skills. She looked embarrassed, then shook her head. I almost said something, then tossed her an apron. Told her to clean up tables. Do a good job and she could come back tomorrow. <nl> She did and she did. About three weeks in, I started training her as a waitress, and within a year she could cover bar. It took a while, but I got her to the point where I could take days off and the place wouldn't burn down. <nl> Then one day I left my resignation on the counter with a note. <nl> "On a Friday, at 3:14am you will find an idiot unconscious in the storeroom. Do not call the cops. He's going to get you back on your feet. Might take a while." <nl> Edit: <nl> Since people have asked <nl> Persona Non Grata (ships of valor book 1) <nl> Aaron Kennedy <nl> Available on amazon (preview enabled) and amazon unlimited (free to read for members) <nl> Thank you all for the kind words and support! <nl> Edit 2 - Added "The Flipside" which is the "Owners" side of the story <eos>

<sos> The Hall of Heroes was one of the few types of places where images of people were permitted to be displayed. <nl> The "Hall" were composed of several dozen corridors not unlike this one: as wide as a street and long as a block, lined with terrifyingly accurate icons, some no larger than my palm but some bigger than my outstretched arms. <nl> I asked my mother why only some were in color. <nl> She explained that the grey icons represented those who had passed on, whose destinies were complete and thus their place in the Hall solidified. <nl> But the fate of those in color had yet to pass, so they were subject to move to more or less favorable positions and their portraits could even change size. A directory was needed to find them. <nl> My mother dialed a few keys on the directory and brought us to her great grandfather, rendered in vibrant color. <nl> He was beyond the realm of man, she said, moving so far and so fast that fate could not keep up with him, and thus he had hardly experienced more years than she had, even though he first ventured towards the stars over a hundred years ago. <nl> His icon was far from the most impressive. But my mother asked me to pray with her anyways, before an icon of a man she never met. Not just for his sake, but for the sake of us all. Fate guide him to our salvation. <eos>

<sos> Rachel Summers had an intimate knowledge of healing the human body. By day, she was a nurse at the local hospital, and her hours were filled with checking in on patients, changing gauzes and bedpans, listening to grouses and complaints, and generally trying to keep as many people alive as possible. More experienced than most doctors, hers was the name most frequently buzzed on the intercom when an emergency beckoned. <nl> Which was why she was slightly ticked off when Victor Lakorkian, her roommate for the last two weeks, steadfastly refused her offers of first aid. <nl> "What do you mean, you're fine?" asked Rachel, adopting the same tone she used for small children and obstinate adults. "Look at the wound! It's bleeding out onto the carpet, for goodness sakes! Whoever told you that tissue paper was a good way to staunch bloodflow?" <nl> "It's just a small cut," said Victor, turning his body away from her. Fresh spots of blood were already blooming through the thick wad of Kleenex he had slapped onto his arm, threatening to trickle down and ruin the floorboards. <nl> Rachel clucked her tongue, then pressed forward, ignoring the grumpy protests. Just before she touched his skin, she channelled the faintest amount of energy into her fingertips. She wanted to calm him down, aid the healing process, but she didn't want the effect to be so pronounced that it would give away the fact that she was Talented. <nl> It worked, after a fashion. Victor stopped struggling, then moodily looked on as Rachel finished the dressing. <nl> "Work accident?" she asked. <nl> "Yea, kind of," he said. "Thanks, I guess. But there was no need to, I would have healed, really." <nl> "That's what they all say," said Rachel. "If I ask you how you got it, would you tell me? I need to know so that I can get you the right medication." <nl> The injury was a serious one, not life-threatening, but certainly grave enough to warrant stitches. Rachel was tempted to simply close the wound herself, bind it together with magical fibres, shorten what would have taken nature a couple of weeks to perhaps a few seconds, tops. That was out of the question, of course, as long as she didn't have her mask on. <nl> "It looks like you got cut by a heated blade, or something like that," said Rachel. Her mind had already discarded the only other possibility, which was contact with an energy pulse, which was impossible given that Victor was still here, alive. "Is your workplace unsafe? You can report such things, you know." <nl> Victor barked out a short laugh. "Hah," he said, "more dangerous than you can imagine. But someone's gotta do what I do, and there's no use complainin'. Are you done fussin'? I've only got a couple of hours before I head out, and I would rather just rest in peace." <nl> A scowl crossed Rachel's face. "I know I should mind my own business, but Victor... you've got to have healthier habits, you know. Your late nights, your frequent injuries, you keeping to yourself in your dark room all the time... the rest of the roommates are fine with you wanting to be left alone, but do try and reach out to others a bit more. It'll do you a world of good to -" <nl> The speed at which Victor lunged forward caught Rachel by surprise, and if she had a hair's less control over her reflexes, she would have thrown up an energy shield, fried Victor on the spot. Instead, he merely bumped past her, rocking her back, as he leapt towards the television, turning up the volume. <nl> "It's them," he said, "they're at it again." <nl> Rachel recognised the scene immediately. Jameson Park, where the anti-government protestors had gathered again, despite all warnings by the government to disperse. The anti-riot police were out in force too, forming a single barricade between the protestors and City Hall. Behind the anti-riot police were huge, ominous shapes, each gleaming in the sun - the Rampagers, metallic monstrosities created by the Tinkerer from the League of Heroes, meant to help maintain law and order in the city. <nl> "I thought the mayor said he would negotiate peacefully with them?" she asked. Had she missed some development in the news? Had she been so caught up with work again that she failed to keep up with what was happening? <nl> "The bastards," said Victor, face scrunched in anger. "I told them, not this way, do it another way, but noooo, they wouldn't listen..." <nl> The camera zoomed in on a protestor hurling a water bottle at the police barricade. It struck a policeman awkwardly on the head, and although his helmet was reinforced, he fell like a rock. Even before his body hit the ground, his fellow officers had already surged forward, stun batons in hand, striking in retaliation. <nl> That single incident, that flame to open gasoline, sparked a convulsive tremor through the crowd. Rachel watched, horrified, as the two masses crashed together. The darkened eyes of the Rampagers lit up ominously. <nl> "Is it so hard to just listen to the citizens, give them what they want?" asked Rachel, her voice dropping to a whisper. <nl> "Fools," said Victor. "The government does care, but no one gives them a chance. You toil all day to make their lives better, but the moment something goes wrong, the moment a single oversight occurs, they overreact like we're oppressing them." <nl> "It's just..." said Rachel, reaching for the right words. "It's just that sometimes the government does seem... heavy-handed, you know? Like they only care about the big picture, but they forget that society's made up of all these small, individual, yet still important, parts..." <nl> Victor slammed the television with his hand, knocking off the snowglobe they kept on top of it. The snowglobe shattered on the ground, spilling its flakes across the floor. "The individual is selfish, Rachel. Remember that. The government knows best, and it is better that way, trust me. I've seen worse." <nl> The violence on the screen escalated, as could be seen by the fiery Molotov cocktails being lobbed by the crowd, and the mind-control beams being engaged by the Rampagers. An emergency broadcast message flashed across the screen, notifying all civilians to stay away from Jameson Park, and also listing a string of numbers to call for help. <nl> Then, a laser beam shot out of the crowd, either from an unregistered Talented or a smuggled energy cannon. The beam coursed right through one of the Rampagers, sundering its protective armor, spilling its electrical guts out. It convulsed, then froze, then crashed to the ground. The protestors, galvanized by this momentary victory, cheered, then redoubled their efforts to raze City Hall to the ground. <nl> At that moment, a single silver symbol appeared at the bottom of the screen. <nl> The emblem of the League of Heroes, a call for the Talented to gather, to lend their strength to the government. <nl> Rachel heard Victor's watch buzz, and he quickly covered it with his good hand. "I've... got to go," he said, as he turned his watch away from Rachel's eyes. "My... boss is calling. Got a last-minute request to... fix one of the machines at work, it seems." <nl> Rachel sighed, then went in search of the dustpan. Someone could get hurt, stepping on the shards of the ruined snowglobe. "Just don't overuse that arm, mister," she said. "The wound will open again, and you'll have more trouble then." <nl> She waited until Victor disappeared into his room again, and ignored him as he emerged with a heavy box. She occupied herself with cleaning up the mess as he rushed out the door, muttering curses along the way. <nl> When she was sure he had gone, that no one could hear her, she stalked back to her room, threw open her wardrobe, keyed in the secret combination, and grimaced as hidden panels unfolded to reveal her disguise. <nl> This was a far cry from when she had an entire lair under the city lake, but this would have to do. <nl> Her heart ached as the sounds of the newscast drifted in from the living room. She reckoned that by the time she got there, the Rampagers would have already stilled over a hundred people, and that wasn't even counting the hundreds more beaten into submission by the police, the very people sworn to protect and serve the public. <nl> "War never ends, does it," said Rachel, otherwise known as the Witch Doctor, bounty of $25 million, third in command of the Insufferables, the underground resistance made up of all Talented deemed unaligned with the interests of the government. <nl> She opened a portal, grit her teeth, then stepped through it. <nl> --- <nl> /r/rarelyfunny <eos>

<sos> I stood dumbstruck by the sight in my front yard. A small black horse stood neighing and stamping it's hooves in the melting snow. When I say horse, it had blue flame in place of a mane and tail and as it stamped small flares leapt from it's hooves. <nl> "Daddy, why is the pony on fire?" My daughter's voice broke my frozen mind. <nl> "Umm, honey, as much as I would love to give you an explanation on what a nightmare is right now, I am a little held up on the fact that I could have asked for one apparently years ago and I would have gotten one so please give daddy a moment to collect himself." I stared down at the letter that was left taped to the door specifically the sender line: Satan. "Uhh, sweety can you tell me how to spell santa?" <nl> "S?" <nl> "Yep." <nl> "A, t?" I shook my head slightly. <nl> "A, n?" She finished and looked at me quizically. <nl> I shook my head again. "Sorry honey, that's, that's not right." <nl> "But that's what the letter says." She pouted. <nl> "I know honey, but that's how you spell Satan." <nl> "Ohhh." She giggled. "S, a, n, t, a." She said proudly. <nl> "Very good. When you sent your letter to Santa, did you check your spelling? Or were you too excited and just sent it?" <nl> "I'm sorry daddy." She pouted looking down. <nl> "No, no it's not your fault. Okay let's, well actually you stay, I'll approach it." I stepped off the the porch and cautiously moved closer to the flaming horse. It turned to stare at me, small flames jetted from it's nostrils as it exhaled harshly. "Hey there, little, guy." I reached out a hand to which it whinnied at shaking its head and backing up. <nl> "Holy-" My wife had apparently come to check on us. "Umm, honey? What the hell is that?" <nl> "It's my pony!" Our daughter answered cheerfully. "It's from, from... Satan! That's what daddy said his name was." <nl> My wife glared at me. "Satan?" <nl> "No what I said, alright, the letter says it's from Satan. I told her to write a letter to Santa for the pony." I tried to explain. "Well at least, *he* delivers." I half mumbled. My wife shot me another glare. <nl> "I love Satan!" Our daughter declared loudly. I looked at my daughter and then back to my wife before bursting into laughter. My wife attempted to maintain her glare but soon failed joining me in a laugh. As I attempted to regain my composure I felt a sudden heat on my back and a blue fireball shot past my shoulder. I fell to the ground and crawled backward putting distance again between me and the nightmare, my daughter giggled at me. <nl> "Hey what's this package?" My wife asked. She tore open the sides and removed the contents. There was a black leather-like lead and a note: <nl> *Dear Eliza,* <nl> *I thank you for the letter, it is rare for me to receive one of its kind. I hope my gift to you is an acceptable one, I agree with your father that everyone should have fun in their life, that a fantasy is something to hope for. I do hope you enjoy this element of fantasy I have granted you. Inside is a lead suitable for ponies of his kind, I believe your father is capable of explaining to you enough about a nightmare for you to properly care for him.* <nl> *With regards, your friend,* <nl> *Satan* <nl> *P.S. He loves apples.* <nl> My wife read the letter outloud and looked up at me, I could tell she was as lost as I was. "Umm, Elly, how about we try and take your new pony to the back so he doesn't surprise anyone else." <nl> "Ok." She skipped down the porch and to her pony. "C'mon Blue." She waved her hand to the pony motioning to it to follow. It stood still staring with its deep red eyes at her. <nl> "Oh!" My wife called out. "He sent an apple along." She looked genuinely approving. She tossed the apple to me and I stood up waving the apple in its face. It began to neigh and quickly followed. <nl> "Wait!" Eliza yelled. "I wanna do it." She whined. I handed her the apple and she called to it making a snapping sound with her tongue. She took it through the gate and into the backyard. <nl> My wife hurried down the steps. "What the hell are we supposed to do with that?" <nl> "How should I know, I don't exactly think it comes with a return to sender address." I replied. <nl> "Well anything else this Christmas you asked Satan to make real from your books?" She mocked. <nl> "Hey, I didn't ask for that, Eliza asked for a pony, I said write a letter to *Santa*." <nl> "Well how the hell did he know that quote from your book?" <nl> "I don't know, maybe he's a fan." <nl> "Nice explanation, hey now it's my turn I'm gonna go write a letter to *Santa*." She gestured quotations in the air, mocking me. "I want magic like Cassie's." <nl> "Nice choice, I love you." I laughed. "Real quick though can we talk about the fact that we're openly discussing Satan like it's normal accepted conversation?" <nl> "No." She replied simply. "We've got a flaming horse in our backyard." She smiled and pointed over to the gate where our daughter was leading her *pony* in circles. <nl> "Have I mentioned I *really* love you." <nl> "You better. We can worry more about if the Devil is real later, for now let's worry about our daughter who's alone in the yard with her fiery pony." <nl> "Daddy!" My daughter screamed. "Blue sneezed and the bush is on fire!" <nl> I headed through the gate over to the small flame slowly heading down the branch. "Yeah, *you're* gonna need to teach him to *not* do that." <nl> _ <nl> [R/TheoreticalFictions](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoreticalFictions) <eos>

<sos> "You don't understand!" She laughed. The little girl, dressed in rags and bare feet, danced through the streets. "I'm the richest person alive." She said with a smile. <nl> The man with the tall hat and high waistcoat and thick suspenders looked down at her. He liked to walk through these parts of the city to remind him. He grew up not more than a few blocks south. <nl> He thought it strange that she had began speaking to him; out of the blue telling him how he didn't understand. Stranger still that she had responded quite reasonable, as if they had been having a perfectly sensible conversation all taking place inside his own mind. <nl> "How do you know I don't understand?" he said as she skipped around him in circles. <nl> "Well, do *you* understand?" <nl> "Understand what?" <nl> "Exactly!" she said with a shriek. <nl> The man had a feeling of familiarity with this girl, as if he knew her from a very long time ago. <nl> "Have we met before? You and I?" he said with a hint of anxiety. <nl> "I've known you for a very long time ago." <nl> As she said this he felt his stomach drop. 'Can she *hear* me?' <nl> "No no, of course I can't *hear* you." <nl> As she said this she stopped circling him. She stood directly in front of him and gazed up with a stare that seemed to look through him. <nl> "I can hear you but not with these ears. I can see you but not with these eyes. Though handless I have a hand in everything and without any desire I control all that you know. I have nothing and so everything is mine. Do you know who I am?" <nl> The man heard himself speak, "No, but I feel like I remember you. From a time I can't place and a place I can't remember. What is your name little one?" <nl> "I'm not little and I'm not one, two, or none. Of the light and the darkness I'm the space which holds both. Of remembering and forgetting, I'm the one who knows both. I am pure consciousness. I have nothing and so I'm the richest person alive. I want nothing so I am given all that this world possesses. I was never created so I can't die. I am fearless ever lasting peace." <nl> "Now tell me sir, just who are you?" <eos>

<sos> Three things contributed to Elizabeth Penigree dancing down the cobbled street, through the peppery rain and silver September evening, telling all who cared to listen that she was rich; the tumour was only one of those things, and it was the one she did not know about. Of course, she felt the headaches -- how could she not? The migraines had only tiptoed in their monthly rehearsals the previous year, but now they stomped almost weekly, thundering forward toward their finale. Their curtain call. *Lonesome pains*, the orphanage owner had told her. No need for a doctor to get involved.  They'd go away when she finally found a family. When a family found her. <nl> Today was that day -- and it was the second reason for her dancing down that weathered street under the paper clouds and candle sun. She'd been *found.* And the finders couldn't have been more perfect. The lady had huge, kind eyes. Not beady or grey, like of those who ran the orphanage -- but fading autumn green; welcoming, like the wavy shore of the sea calling her to come dip her feet. Not that she had seen the sea. Oh and the man! He had smiled at her. No man had ever smiled at her like that. Like they'd meant it. The scars she felt inside of her -- that she'd always felt inside of her, had been suddenly coated by something sweet. Treacle, she pondered. At the very least, by something hopeful. <nl> They could have had any of the children. But they'd chosen her. Elizabeth. <nl> There were papers to sign and dots to dot, crosses to cross. But they said they would be back tomorrow, and then she would be leaving with them. She could hardly stop her feet from fidgeting upon hearing those words, but she showed restraint for a little longer -- that's what people looked for in a child: restraint -- and she waited until they had left before moving. She scrambled to the front door after they closed it, and pressed her ear firm against the oak, waiting for the rumble of the automobile to die away as the evening wind. Then, she snuck out. <nl> She hadn't gone very far at all when she'd found the silver coin on the side of the pavement, a glimmer of light beneath a crumbling leaf. The third and final reason. A sign from God of how her life was changing -- she would tell all who would listen of her good fortune. And so the richest girl in the world danced through the peppery rain, through the satin September evening -- until the lonesome headache began, for the final time. She stumbled on the pavement, and almost fell. Why,  she wondered, as the dancers in her head began to stomp, why was it hurting still? Perhaps it wouldn't stop until she was living with her finders. She bit down on her tongue for distraction -- nothing would ruin her perfect today. She continued down the street, not noticing how cold her feet were against the cobblestone, or how numb and disobedient her limbs had become.  She chose not to see the black dots that clouded her precious evening. <nl> The curtain call arrived with a cacophony of applause. A rapturous rupture. The red of a liquid rose trickled from her nose. <nl> She fell onto the street, her head bouncing like a rubber ball with a hiss of air as it slowly deflated. The coin escaped her hand as her fingers peeled open, and rolled behind her, back toward the orphanage. <nl> People crowded about her as the blood pooled. Virgin red dying dirty grey. <nl> *Are you okay, girl?* came a man's voice. <nl> *Get a doctor,* said another. *Poor lass,* cooed a woman. <nl> Poor? Couldn't they see? <nl> *I'm not poor,* Elizabeth tried to explain, *not any longer* -- but her lips only managed a crooked smile. <nl> --- <nl> Thank you for reading. More on /r/nickofnight <eos>

<sos> "You bitch!" A voice roared from upstairs, followed shortly by a loud crash.  I rolled my eyes and heaved myself to my feet.  Here we go again. <nl> "What's wrong?" I called wearily, making my way towards the stairs.  Libitina was nonchalantly coming down, Bible in hand.  For being the incarnation of Death, she always seemed to be reading her Bible (which she had stolen from a motel room when I wasn't looking.  Ironic, right?). <nl> "What're they fighting about?" I asked her as she rounded the bannister and headed toward the kitchen. <nl> "Limos stole Bellona's boyfriend or something stupid like that." She whispered, not even looking up from her book.  I sighed and rubbed the bridge of my nose as Morbi came tumbling down the stairs as well. <nl> "Bellona's about to lose it!" she gasped, running for cover.  Just then, a lamp flew across the hallway and smashed straight through the wall. <nl> "Your anger issues are why he left you!" Limos screamed, appearing from her room, followed <nl> promptly by her flying dresser. <nl> "And he thought the best way to get around my anger was to cheat on me?!" <nl> Oh boy.  I'm going to have to take a third mortgage. <nl> "Girls!  Come on, calm down!" I called up to them. <nl> "Bellona is the one who needs to calm down!" Limos yelled back. <nl> "You want to reenact Troy?" Bellona continued ranting as she too appeared. <nl> "Please, I can't afford to rebuild the house again!" <nl> Suddenly, Bellona seemed to gag and doubled over, dry-heaving.  She growled audibly and waved her hand, prompting a curt scream to come from the kitchen, followed by the smoke alarm going off and Morbi appearing, the tips of her hair on fire. <nl> "Don't make me sick!" Bellona yelled, charging down the stairs after her sister. <nl> "Why are you all against me?!" She continued, "Who else wants to take a shot at me?" her voice broke at the last and I could see some wetness in her eyes.  Registering what she said, I pointed at Libitina as she came out of the kitchen too, "You stay out of this!" I ordered.  The last thing we needed was somebody's heart stopping.  Libitina just shrugged, coolly.  Ever calm. <nl> "Can you guys just work this out without destroying the neighborhood?" I pleaded. <nl> "Oh, I'll work it out.  I'll work it out at her funeral!" Bellona lunged at Limos again, who did her best to evade--by using Morbi as a human shield. <nl> "This is hardly a fair fight!" She cried, looking for options, "Libitina?  Help?" <nl> "No!  Don't kill your sister!" <nl> "Just for a second!  We'll bring her back!" Limos kept pleading. <nl> Bellona waved her hand and the couch behind Limos burst into flames, catching Limos's pants on fire in the process.  I was starting to get annoyed about this all, too.  As Limos started screaming and swatting at the flames, it seemed like all the darkness in the room congealed around the flames and snuffed them out.  Libitina, the sleeping giant of the four.  Putting out the fire seemed to only enrage Bellona even more, though and she started screaming again as she drew on her power.  She was about to explode, and I really can't afford to rebuild the house again. <nl> "Libi," I sighed, "Just do it." I looked over to see the slightest grin on her usually placid face as she waved a hand and all three of her sisters collapsed to the floor. <nl> "Bring them back in two minutes." I ordered, trudging back over to the couch.  Out of all four of them, I'm really glad Death is the obedient one. <eos>

<sos> "Are you sure you want all four of them?" Ms. Voight asked, trying unsuccessfully to keep a smile from slipping onto her face. <nl> I nodded as I read the document again. "Why not? You said they're inseparable." <nl> "They might be a bit much to ... handle. I mean, four kids, and these four in particular ..." <nl> "Yeah, well, you've never seen me in a temper," I said, and reached for a pen that she hurried to hand me. <nl> "Sure, I don't mean anything against you, but these four can be strange. Sometimes." <nl> I frowned at her. "What's the matter? You seemed practically relieved when I agreed to adopt them. Now you're having second thoughts?" <nl> "No, no ... I'm sure you'll cope just fine." She smiled, overly sweet, and pointed at the next stack of forms awaiting me. "Well, let's just get these out of the way real quick, shall we?" <nl> *** <nl> "Well, we're here." I turned into our driveway, and the girls, who'd been talking softly among themselves in the back of the van, fell quiet. <nl> "Wow," Mina said, brushing her hair out of her face. "It's ... that's a big house." <nl> "What, did you think I was kidding when I said you'll each have a bedroom to yourselves?" I said, putting the car into park. <nl> Three answered in the negative, but Amber only glowered at them. That look lent an illusion of her close-cropped auburn hair being ablaze. "Oh come on, you all thought she was bullshitting." <nl> "Hey, I'm right here, miss," I said. "And don't use that sort of language, please. Let's get your bags inside." <nl> My daughters--God, I had to get used to saying that in my head--refused my help with their luggage, and trooped after me in silence as we walked up the driveway. Not that they were sullen or anything; I had the impression that they were still trying to process the Harley, the fountain, and the-- <nl> "Holy crap, is that a Ferrari?" Amber said. <nl> I sighed, but said nothing. Then something tapped me on the arm; I tried not to jump at how cold her fingers felt. It was Ashlee, who pointed at the woods with a dreamy look on her face. "It's really quiet here." <nl> "Bout thirty minutes from the nearest town," I replied as I unlocked the front door. <nl> "You'd know if you hadn't been sleeping on our drive here," Ivory said in a bossy tone, but was interrupted by a bout of coughing. <nl> "Okay okay," I said, before Ashlee could retort, but the girl only drifted into the house in silence before me. The rest followed, and then I shut the door behind us. <nl> "Welcome home," I said. <nl> "Er ... mom? What is it you do for a living again?" Mina said, staring open-mouthed at the mini-chandelier over the living room. <nl> I smiled and put my arms around them. "I run my own company. Now, let's go get you settled." <nl> *** <nl> For what felt like the dozenth time in just three months, I found myself walking in the hallways of Far Meadow High School again. I knew the way and the amount of time required to reach Ivory's classroom so well, I had begun scheduling business calls to fill up the time. <nl> Mr. Banner met me with a look of frustrated concern. "It's a nosebleed this time," he said, Ivory standing behind him with a tissue to her nose. <nl> I heaved a sigh. "Guess I'll take her home for the day." <nl> As usual, Ivory wore a look of guilt all the way to the car, which slowly turned into one of relief. "Math lesson is so boring," she said, crumpling the blood-stained tissue up and putting it into a pocket. <nl> I scowled. "We've been over this. Just because you've studied three lessons ahead and done all the exercises, it doesn't mean you can skip classes. Next time you pull this nosebleed or stomach cramp nonsense again, I might just leave you there." <nl> Her eyes widened in the rear view mirror. "But I might die! The other kids might catch what I have. Remember that time I puked my guts out? Please don't leave me, I don't want to die in that dumb class!" <nl> "As the eldest, what do you think your sisters might think if you get to skip classes all the time?" <nl> "Pfah. Amber's got a boyfriend, no way she's going home unless he's not there. Mina's really popular, she's like some diet expert or something so all the cool girls want to hang out with her." <nl> I nodded absently, thinking about the board meeting I would have to miss this afternoon. <nl> "--and Ashlee's a weirdo in school, you know. She keeps dead spiders inside a box and shows them to everyone. Claims she killed them with her thoughts." <nl> "Is she being bullied for that?" I said, an edge in my tone. <nl> "Nah, I think most people are scared of her or something." Ivory had whipped her smartphone out. "Don't think they even know why. I told some of my friends about the time she got lost in the woods for half a day--" <nl> "Not a funny story to share," I said through gritted teeth. <nl> "--or the time she hid a dead rabbit inside Amber's closet--" <nl> "Still not funny." <nl> "--what a mess, all that screaming and stuff being thrown about, you'd think--" <nl> "I think I'll take you to a doctor," I said. <nl> Not a peep was heard from her the rest of the way home. <nl> *** <nl> "What now?" I said, marching into the principal's office. Ashlee was there, sitting in a corner staring off into nothing. <nl> "Your daughter, Ms. Christian, has been telling her classmate George all morning, that he was going to die before the day's end." Principal Simpson had his burly arms crossed as he glared at her. "I do not tolerate my students threatening one another in my school!" <nl> "It's not a threat, she's just a bit distracted at times," I said hurriedly, going to Ashlee and hugging her. "Her filter just goes offline, you know." <nl> "Well, George is having a nervous breakdown right now in the med room, and I don't need him to see her anymore today. Take her home, please." <nl> "Ashlee dear, what's gotten into you?" I said as I escorted her out of the school. "Dead animals is one thing, but you can't say such things to your friends!" <nl> "He's not really a friend," she said cheerfully. "Anyway, I was just messing with him. He took my box away and hid it, I was in such a fright. Don't worry, Mom. He'll die three years from today." <nl> *** <nl> Principal Dawson, who had replaced Simpson after the latter resigned almost a year ago, shook his head at me when I showed up outside the school gates. <nl> "This is beyond me," he said. "The police will be here soon." <nl> A full blown riot was taking place in the school yard; children armed with chairs and textbooks going at each other with fury. There was no order to it, no sides as far as I could tell. <nl> Only two people weren't fighting; Ashlee and Ivory, sitting on a bench. Ashlee was giggling and pointing at nobody in particular, while Ivory had her face buried in homework. <nl> I walked to them and said, "What the hell is going on? I got a call from the principal saying--" <nl> "Mina stole Amber's boyfriend, so they're fighting," Ivory said. <nl> My girls--my beautiful sixteen-year-old daughters, whom I treasured more than anything in the world--made me want to pull my hair out sometimes. <nl> "So why is the entire school fighting?" I said. <nl> "Because Amber controls half of the school, and Mina the other half." <nl> "Mom, don't stop them, please," Ashlee said, her gaze suddenly sharpening. "I think someone might actually die today." <nl> "Is that so?" I said softly. My daughters froze, and then jammed their fingers into their ears. <nl> Then I bellowed, "Mina and Amber Christian, you stop this madness at once!" <nl> Silence fell upon the entire school--even the sirens outside felt diminished. A hundred heads turned my way, and I finally spotted the troublesome duo at the heart of it, their hands around each other's throats. <nl> "For three years--three damned years--I've been putting up with your little quirks and visiting this school like I'm enrolled here myself, but you just made me miss an important flight today. I'm going to count to three, and if you don't come here by that time, I'm leaving you back where I found you." <nl> No sooner had I said it than Mina and Amber scurried to me, red-faced and crying. I added shock to their expressions when I slapped each of them once, before drawing them both into a hug. <nl> "Girls, I would like to think I raised you better than to fight over boys--and start a school riot while you're at it." <nl> They babbled in protest, but I hushed them. "Enough. I wish this never happened, but there will be consequences for today." <nl> "Mom, what will they do to us?" Amber whispered. <nl> "I don't know. But I promise you one thing--" I brushed her hair and kissed Mina's cheek. "I'll be there with you." <nl> *** <nl> *Check out my [sub](http://reddit.com/r/nonsenselocker) for more stories!* <eos>

<sos> There's nothing that strange about them at first; it's the same sad story you always hear. Abandoned by their parents, kicked around from this shelter to that one, one foster place to another. There were always problems and the girls never stayed anywhere very long. <nl> But problem children were your specialty. (Or so you used to believe.) You couldn't always make a difference, but you tried. You tried to be there when no one else was. You tried to see the good in them when everyone else had given up. Your ex always said you had a martyr  complex and maybe they were right, and maybe that's why you fell for them to begin with. Doesn't matter. <nl> What matters are the four girls you adopted. The paperwork says they're sisters and that's the only way you'd know. The first one, the oldest (you think) is albino, sickly and pale. Life with her is a whirlwind of doctor's appointments and prescription medicines, specialists and itemized lists of all the things she can't do. But none of it seems to help, and the only noticeable difference is your shrinking bank account. You learn to keep her away from other people pretty early on, as nearly everything she has is contagious in one way or another. <nl> You try to do for her anyway. You bring her books and movies and activities she can engage in from her bed. You get her her own computer so she can have access to the internet. You hire nurses, plan family outings around days when she's feeling better. You research hospital locations in advance. She's not a bad girl. Sweet, in her own way. It's not her fault she's sick all the time. Unfortunately, it means you are too. <nl> The second one is- well. She's your problem child. A problem child among problem children. Wild and red-haired with a temper like a bonfire...you can't control her. No one can control her. She has a way of instigating things, bringing out the worst in the people around her. But the thing that really bothers you is she always has a reason why it's someone else's fault. Always a litany of ways to justify her actions. It was those Other People, she tells you. Those Other People, and the things they did. She has her reasons and if you listen to her long enough, her reasons will become yours. She'll convince you she was in the right. You stop listening to her excuses because it's all you can do. <nl> You try to love her anyway, to show her a different way, fill up that angry heart with something better. Unfortunately, she can bring out the worst in you as well. <nl> The third sister is dark haired and dark skinned and much too thin. The doctor says it's anorexia. You take her to meetings, to support groups. You beg with her to eat. You try to fix her favorite foods. <nl> None of it helps. She's too thin, bones sticking out everywhere, skin pulled tight. She'd make a great Halloween costume you think, and then you cry as you scrape the food into the garbage where it goes to waste. Unfortunately, you're starting to hate food too, just from the stress of it all. You dread mealtimes now. <nl> Then there's the youngest. The 'good girl'. She's quiet like the eldest but healthy, or so you assume. She doesn't break the rules like her flame-haired sister, or refuse to eat. She also doesn't talk. Ever. The doctors say there's no physical reason they can find, that it must be psychosomatic and given who she's related to you think that's a safe bet. <nl> And yet, for all of that she's the one that unsettles you the most. The file you got said she's the youngest but sometimes you wonder. There's something *old* in her eyes and when you catch her staring at you it raises the hackles on the back of your neck.  She doesn't appear to be interested in anything at all. Not in books or movies or games or other people. She seems politely disinterested with the world; bored but serene.  She eats what you put in front of her and you can't say whether she enjoys it or not. She goes to bed at the same time every night. She obeys every rule she's given and it freaks you out a bit, because  there's something completely otherworldly about her, and you have no idea how to reach her. Sometimes you think she's amused by all the little rules and silly rituals humans have, but then you catch yourself thinking that way and stop. You don't even know where those thoughts come from. <nl> You're under a lot of stress, is all. <nl> Then it all hits the fan the night your red-head daughter brings home a boy. <nl> (will continue later, am tired) <eos>

<sos> "Look, he, like... he just wasn't good enough for you. OK?" <nl> "Yeah, I guess... He seemed nice though." <nl> Nice. The guy comes charging into my palace dragging a terrified octogenarian in white robes clutching a wooden staff for dear life and a teenage girl with a bargain-basement spell book who looked like she was positively shitting herself, dressed all up in holy plate armor, shouting obscenities about the "fucking filthy bastard abomination piece of shit demons" he was going to "disembowel" while his "cleric" and "white mage" tried to keep from being eaten by the palace decor and scrambled to remember the three spells they'd memorized in the panic of it all. Super nice guy. <nl> "Your infernal highness," one of the knights - a handsome, well-mannered incubus; seven hundred years on the job; great guy - said as he approached the throne. "I have a report." <nl> "Is it about the... um, are we calling him a paladin? Is that what we're doing?" <nl> "He was wearing the regalia of the Holy Order, your great dark majesty." <nl> "It just seems like such a loaded term. You know, we're trying to get away from this whole us versus them rhetoric, be more tolerant, watch our microaggressions, eat fewer babies - you know, a better demon king for a better demon world." <nl> "Yes, your magnificent wickedness, and I am honored to serve such a respectable lord of darkness, but the... um, the gentleman and his companions, sire..." <nl> "Right, your report." <nl> "Should the lady really be present for this, sire?" <nl> "Oh, go on, Igzaril," the princess said, resting her head in her right hand as she tried to get more comfortable in her seat next to the throne, "I've heard much worse. Trust me. My father has all of the eunuchs who attend me castrated with string and bits of glass." Igzaril - that was his name; I'd been calling him 'Sir Sexy Horns' for so long in my head I'd forgotten - shuddered at the thought and then nodded. <nl> "Entrails, sire. The hell hounds in the lobby did a spectacular job of ending the... gentleman's... crusade? Can I still say crusade?" <nl> "Let's go with mission to be safe." <nl> "Well, anyway, while the hounds were happy to tear the gentleman apart," and that's when I interrupted him, growing suddenly agitated by the entire situation. It had been sixteen months since the king of... whatever the human cesspool above ground and due East of here was called had orchestrated the "kidnapping" of his daughter in the desperately lazy attempt at finding a "worthy" and "honorable" man to marry her. And kill me. That was also big on his political agenda. Great way to score points with the Holy Order - kill Lord Zabuliz the Unkillable Evil. Ignore the "unkillable" part of my name entirely. Focus on the last word. Humans. <nl> "Just call him the 'guy,' or something. Paladin is too political, but 'gentleman' is giving him entirely too much credit." <nl> "Yes, sire. Well, the guy who attacked - oh you're right, that does feel a lot better - and his support team must have drank a rather impressive amount of holy water just before storming the palace. The hell hounds all have pretty badly singed snouts, I'm afraid." <nl> "Oh no!" the princess said at once, sitting up straight with her eyes open and look a genuine concern for the cute - albeit snarling, ferocious, wreathed in flame, and almost constantly dripping with the blood of the innocent - hell hounds that stood guard on the lower levels - the only levels of the palace that any of her potential suitors had ever made it to. We ran a tight ship. "Are the puppies alright?" <nl> "They'll be fine, Princess," Igrazil said, bowing to conceal an obvious smile, "they just might be sulking for a while. If another attack comes in soon we might actually have to send in personnel to deal with the situation." <nl> "How well staffed is the lobby?" <nl> "Well, there's the receptionist and usually four to six guards posted. We could up the number of guards if you'd like, sire, maybe give a few of the more industrious imps something useful to do, but Flzamin - she's the receptionist - has been complaining that she's getting a bit bored at her desk and she's actually an impressively skilled magician - necromancy, mostly, although I think I saw mastery of elemental conjuration and classical malediction on her CV. With the caliber of magic users that have been coming through on palad...'good guy' support I'm confident she'd be more than a match. She'd probably have them eating hellfire the moment they step through the door." <nl> "Well, that's serendipitous to say the least. Inform... was it Fuhlazmin?" <nl> "Flzamin, your unparalleled malevolence." <nl> "Let her know she'll be getting a raise. I'll think of a new title as well. All I've got in my head right now is 'battle secretary' and that's hot garbage." <nl> "There is another problem, my immortal oppressor of the light," Igrazil said, and I sunk instinctively back in my throne so far that my wings got all mashed up and my tail squished against the seat in a manner so painful that I had to instantly adjust. "The holy water that the guy and his companions drank. Their entrails splattered against the walls of the lobby. Steaming with holy magic." <nl> "Ugh," I said, putting a clawed hand to my forehead. I felt a migraine coming on right behind my horns. "And no one can clean it up without getting burned, right?" <nl> "I'll do it," the princess said, standing up and walking towards the door without a second word. She sounded happy, perhaps excited even to have something to do besides sit around and wait to be rescued, and even looked back once  and smiled before disappearing through the gate of lost souls down the stairwell through the chamber of horrors and the tunnel of unrelenting evil that led past the cafeteria to the broom closet where she'd presumably - hopefully - break out the purple stuff and the good mop. <nl> "She's great," Igrazil said once she was out of the throne room. "Really. It's been lovely having her around." <nl> "I know. I'd marry her myself if I weren't so fucking gay." <nl> EDIT: Wow, I did not respect this kind of response, thank you all so much! I'll post a Part 2 as a reply to this comment. I hope you guys enjoy it as well! <nl> EDIT 2: Again, WOW. I really did not expect this to blow up. For my first (I think my first?) post on this sub, I was optimistically hoping for double digit upvotes at best, so THANK YOU ALL again! I will definitely continue this story - I have absolutely no clue what my next step is going to be aside from me writing and posting it (somewhere? somehow? someone help? advice?) but I obviously have an audience here and I love this story so far so I will definitely give you guys more. As in hopefully tomorrow more. Thanks again! <nl> EDIT 3: (Last one, really) OK so for the time being I am going to be posting the continuation of this story directly on my profile until I find a better place to stick them, so - can I even ask people to subscribe to my profile? Is that soliciting? Will a Mod come strike me down? Anyway, for now, Parts 1 and 2 (and tomorrow, Part 3!) of "The Infinite Darkness of Lord Zabuliz the Unkillable Evil (And Friends!)" will be posted directly on my profile, /u/bochibochi <eos>

<sos> The woman showed up at his doorstep. The doorbell pinged anxiously. <nl> "Who is it?" Jaqie yelled. The chair he sat in sagged. Silence followed. <nl> The doorbell squawked again, against its will. The woman began pressing it again and again. The color seemed to disappear around her. <nl> Jaqie stood up and his chair groaned. The brown leather seemed to gray with each step he took towards the door. <nl> "What do you want?" He asked as he grabbed the knob of the door. "I don't have any appointments schedu..." his voice caught in his throat. <nl> She wore a USA Today badge. Her gray pantsuit wore her body well. She nodded courteously. <nl> "I'm here for Jaqie Dorenty. Is that you?" Her voice was clear, but the area surrounding her body seemed to dampen everything ever so slightly. <nl> "Yes," Jaqie replied after processing her request. Then asked,"What do you want?" <nl> "Just a second. I'd prefer to keep my shoes on. I hope that's alright wth you?" She begin to walk forward. <nl> Jaqie hesitated, but she was already halfway through his door. He found himself sitting back where he had been. The lady sat across from him. <nl> The leather chair was hers now. And it definitely seemed gray. Everything seemed gray to Jaqie, right now. <nl> "I want to show you something." The lady took her phone out of her pocket. "We started a report a few weeks ago." <nl> She continued to talk, but the noise became less and less distinguishable. Jaqie heard something about 1000 people, and maybe his name. The grayness around him grew louder and he found his gaze drifting. <nl> "Hello?" She snapped her fingers in front of his eyes. He barely moved. <nl> How is this possible, she thought. The stories thy had all heard about this man. This man. Right in front of her. They couldn't have been lying. They had done everything randomly. It was impossible. <nl> "He changed my life," most had said. <nl> "I wouldn't be here if it weren't for him," said others. <nl> A thousand thoughts flashed before her eyes, and she buried her doubt. She would report her story and be done with it. She had known something was up. At least she'd be able to move on from this ridiculousness that had started everyone in the office to sharing stories about being saved. <nl> "I am who I am now, because of Jaqie Dorenty." <nl> He sat in front of her. Looking dull. Everything was gray. <nl> His lungs filled with all the everything, and he held it for just a second. <nl> She tilted her head. Shifting her brows. <nl> As he exhaled, all of the color came back. She hadn't noticed. She had never noticed. Everything was so vibrant. <nl> A tear rolled down her cheek. <nl> They had all been right. <eos>

<sos> Sitting alone in my room, I closed my eyes, wishing whoever had just rang the doorbell would just leave. I wasn't feeling up to dealing with people today. I had seen my best friend. There was just one problem with that. <nl> I see dead people. <nl> Well, *almost* dead people, to be accurate. It's my own morbid miracle, a gift or a curse depending on the day. <nl> It started when I was small, venturing out of the house with my parents. I would point and scream happily, begging my parents to look. It's another person! At first she ignored it. In later years she wrote it off as imagination. Not long after that I had learned not to bring it up. For me, seeing a stranger on the street was exciting. For my mother, it was cruel. She knew I couldn't see anything in the darkness, and her blind child claiming she could see people seemed like a cry of desperation; I wished I could see people, so I convinced myself that I did. I had never discovered the mystery of why I can see certain strangers, but it had become my normal. <nl> Until last year. My family had gone to see my grandmother in the hospital, unsure how long she had left on this earth. I had only been in a hospital once before at a young age, but when my mother told me they were filled with lots of people I assumed that's why I could see more of them. I saw my grandmother that day, for the first time in my life. Her thin, silvery hair was short and surprisingly well maintained for someone who had been in that bed for weeks. She looked fragile, her arms far from the strong, energetic ones that had rescued me from mishaps in my youth. I had no idea why I could see her, but it was my miracle. Until, soon after returning home that night, we got the call that she had passed away. That's when I began to put it together. Months later my theory was confirmed when I witnessed a car accident. Or rather, witnessed the life leaving the accident. The sound of crunching metal to my right while riding in the car caused me to whip my head to the source of the sound. A young woman entered my darkness, bloody and barely leaving. Moments later, she stopped breathing and faded from my view. <nl> Sighing, I stood and walked toward my door. I could hear voices downstairs, sure that the stranger had decided to stay. Today was not the day to be reprimanded for rudeness, so I made my way into the living room with my best "welcome to our home" face. The scene I found cause every cell in my body to freeze. My breath stopped, my body refused to move, I was even certain my heart had decided not to beat. I could see my parents. My father stood, talking into the darkness, while my mother approached from the direction of the kitchen. For one instant, the magic of seeing them for the first time took over. Its decimation was swift as terror kicked in. The sound of my brother's footsteps behind me broke me from my spell. I turned, and saw him clearly for the first time. His smirk was playful as he whispered in my ear. <nl> "Thanks a lot, Goodie Two Shoes, if you hadn't come out I could have gotten away with staying in my room too." He looked at me strangely when I didn't joke back. <nl> "Hey, there they are! Where's the youngster? I'd just love to see her.." The words came from the darkness and my voice refused to work. I looked at my brother next to me, his disgust clear as he moved slightly to the side, blocking the staircase. <nl> "Playing." <nl> I cursed myself for my stupidity, standing frozen when I could see my whole family. Running to my younger sister's room, I opened the door quickly and saw nothing. "Sophie?" I said into the void, but my answer came from the bottom of the stairs. <nl> "She's in my room." I turned to his room, taking a deep breath as I opened the door. I saw no sign of the six year old girl, but heard her giggling at the other side of the room. <nl> "You gotta close the door! Bubby said I can only play with her if I close the door!" Sighing, I whispered calmly for her to stay here with the hamster and locked my brother's door quietly as I closed it. Downstairs, my father was still talking to the person that I still could not see. I had known his voice instantly. My best friend's father. <nl> I silently cursed myself foe never listening to my brother. For years he had hated my friend's dad, and when pressed he would just mutter something about "the guy's a creep". I had never understood what my brother saw in him that was so awful, when I and the rest of the world just saw a family man. Suddenly my father's conversation changed from background noise to the center of my attention. <nl> "Why don't you come in, have a beer? I'm sure that family of yours can spare you for a bit." He offered with a smile. <nl> "Oh, they've got all the time in the world." <eos>

<sos> Boston. <nl> Here I find myself again, strolling down a valley of asphalt, glass, and concrete. I'd been to so many like it in the last few hundred years, but each one had it's own unique personality. <nl> I grumble to myself as I wander, eyeing every "help wanted" sign I pass. Driven once again by the tiresome necessity of finding a new job like every other time I'd moved. Ten years is a long time to some, but often not long enough. I had to leave wherever I lived before I got too tied down, before it got dangerous or people started asking too many questions. <nl> Supermarket? Pshh, not likely. Barber? If there was one thing I didn't want to do all day, it was touch other people's heads. The fire company? Ha! Way too dangerous, I could still get hurt after all, and what's the point of long life just to potentially throw it away on a risky job. Bookstore? Hmmm, always a safe bet, lots to read, nice and quiet... <nl> Ugh. Maybe I should just pull up an online job board, roll some dice and be done with it. It's bad enough having to keep getting to know all new people every time. <nl> I glanced around at the people wandering the street. Pondering for a moment what each of them was about today. What were they each trying to make of their short little lives. One very old woman passing by looked up at me with shockingly green eyes. I froze as the spark made its way through me and erupted a powder keg of a memory buried for nearly a century. <nl> *Smoke. Flames. Heat. Oh so much heat!* <nl> *I crouched low, groggy with sleep, still trying to get my bearings.* <nl> *When had this fire started? How? How did it get so far before waking me up? I have to get out of here! I feel like I'm swimming in syrup. The fire is in my lungs! No. I can't panic. I have to get out of here! It won't end like this!* <nl> *A cry. There's a screaming child. No, I can't help, I have to get out! But... I'll never stop having nightmares about this if I ignore it. There, in the crib! Where are the parents? Oh no, the other room is caved in. I've got to get us out of here. Wow, I've never seen eyes so green...* <nl> "Excuse me ma'am, I just can't help but say, you have such lovely vibrant emerald eyes." <nl> "Oh thank you dearie, you sure know how to bring a smile to a lady." <nl> "I hope you don't mind me saying, you really seem like you've been around quite a long time, but you have such a lively air about you." <nl> "Ha ha, funny you should say that, I've just recently celebrated my 100'th birthday! I am so blessed to have been around here for so long." <nl> "Wow, well it must've been a great 100 years for you then!" <nl> "You might be surprised. I lost my family to a fire before I knew them, I only survived by the kindness of a mysterious stranger. I have endured many hardships. War, heartbreak, and loss. But, I never would have gotten to experience any of that if I had perished with my family. Nor would I have had the chance to cherish all the goodness and love that I now have in my life. That stranger inspired me to give everything I could to help those with nothing. It's all been worth it, just to brighten up the lives of those I meet, even if just for a little while." <nl> She looked up at me with a smile of deep joy. "Ah well, you youngsters have better things to do than listen to an old woman ramble on about the good ole days. I best keep up my walk before these old joints freeze up." <nl> For a moment, I simply stare as she slowly but surely makes her way past me and down the sidewalk with that friendly smile and still confident step. "Wait up! Maybe I don't have anything better to do than listen to some ramblings on a nice stroll about town." <nl> "Oh, well that would be lovely." <nl> As we walk, I can't help but marvel at the sheer chance of it all. You know, maybe I will try out that fire fighting job. After all, what's the point of living a long time without giving some of that life to others? <eos>

<sos> Elisabeth watched, unfazed, as the devil materialized amongst billowing smoke and sizzling flame in her dining room. Up until this point, she'd been dining alone, as usual, though she wondered if the spectacle would bring the attention of her staff, or if - perhaps - this grandiosity was an illusion for her senses only. <nl> The devil was enormous, and approached her with a clawed appendage outstretched. From somewhere in the depths of her mind, Elizabeth could hear the familiar raspy growl that wasn't exactly words, but was unmistakable in it's meaning. <nl> **"Elizabeth Freeman, I am here for your soul."** <nl> Taking her time, she wiped her mouth and set the linen napkin next to her plate. She rested her elbows on either side, tented her fingers, and leveled her gaze directly at the eyes of the devil. "No you're not." <nl> **"How dare you, mortal. You signed a contract, and our deal is done. You've achieved your goal, and built your empire. Future generations of your line should want for nothing. Your soul is the price. I am here to collect."** <nl> "Sole." <nl> **"What?"** <nl> With her own display of magic, Elizabeth stood and procured an ancient- looking roll of parchment from thin air, and flattened it on the table in front of her. She slipped on her reading glasses, searching nimbly with her index finger for the exact line she needed in the contract. "The deal we signed was for my sole. S-o-l-e, not soul, s-o-u-l." She pushed forward her plate of flat fish with a lemon and caper beurre blanc. "You can have this shit." <nl> For a moment, the devil was so still, its presence seemed to absorb any light on its side of the table. Then its eyes pinched shut as an unmistakable look of pain and frustration overtook its powerful visage. It snatched up the contract, reading it over in a desperate frenzy before letting out a roar that crossed over from the plane of telepathy into actual vocal sounds. "Aaagghhh! What the heck!?" <nl> Elizabeth smirked. She remembered the feeling of empowerment when she first discovered the contract's flaw. All these years, she'd been eagerly awaiting this moment. <nl> Something made the devil pause again. A grin spread across its face, and it once again slipped back into a menacing facade. Ash and embers swirled around the room, daring to smother or spark. **"Your empire... was it not built on the bounty of the sea? I WILL take your sole. I will take all of it, and leave you with nothing."** <nl> "Motherfucker, I sell cod." <eos>

<sos> Lulia hated Josh so much that even the act of buying magazines to cut up into a death threat filled her with rage. "Who actually buys magazines these days", she mumbled as she searched for scissors in her messy junk drawer. "How does he always manage to make my life harder just by existing?" She smiled and thought to herself that THAT particular problem would come to an end soon enough. She hadn't actually thought of what to write yet, so she decided to just cut out multiples of each letter from a "Birds and Blooms" gardening magazine. She only managed to get to "J" when she started noticing her breathing slow- something about this activity was the most soothing thing she had felt in weeks of anger and hatred. At first she thought it was the dioramas of fountains and forget-me -nots, but around the time she found herself laughing and cutting out little birds to use for dotting her eyes, she realized that it was the act of creation that was turning the static hum of her hatred into excitement and anticipation. The thrill of turning mundane letters into a Warhol-esque collage set off something primal in her, and for the first time in so lomg, Lulia found herself grounded. <nl> The next day, Josh checked his letter box to find a piece of construction paper majestically decorated with birds, flowers, and, directly in the center, a message that read, "I foRGiVe yoU." "Huh," he said, "I wonder who that's from," and went about his day. <eos>

<sos> There was a production to the whole magic business. A man in the middle with a growing beard that was speaking a mile a minute, a group around him casting stamina spells and sleeplessness spells, and a woman on the side with a stopwatch in her hand keeping track of how long it was taking Bartholomew Balthazar III to cast the Enigmas Tomingata. <nl> The Enigmas Tomingata was a useless spell, a day and a half long and all it did was an extravagantly clean beard trim. That being said, it was right in the sweet spot for competitive casting. <nl> "Anashalos," I yawned, and a wave of wakefulness came over me. I really hadn't been thinking when I took this job, I'd thought about the easy money and how easy it would be to stay in the same spot for 36 hours with a stopwatch in my hand to see if Bartholomew Balthazar III could beat his previous record of 35 hours, 56 minutes and 45 seconds to cast the Enigmas Tomingata. What I hadn't considered was how boring watching an old man try to rap nonsense would be. That being said, it was a days job, and it kept me in my apartment. <nl> The stopwatch clicked over to 35:56:46 and I considered stopping the spell. Bartholomew was around the end of the incantation, somewhere around Septivus Morani which meant that I could at least let him finish. He needed a trim anyway. <nl> The spell winded down, and the group around Balthazar started to buzz. Did they really think they won? They were off by a full minute this time around. I didn't know what had gone on, but I also didn't care. A missed attempt meant I could go home instead of staying here and signing a thousand sheets of paper. <nl> The time was revealed with a quick sorry and a bow before I ducked out of the auditorium. I had better things to do with my time then stay around Balthazar and hear him try to figure out where he'd lost a minute. Now that I had rent it meant that I could spend the evening focusing on real magic. <nl> Solo spellcasting was something of a lost art. Sure, old men like Balthazar worked their entire lives to make sure that they were the quickest spell weavers on the market, but realistically spells were never made to be done by one man. At least not spells that had any sort of power behind them. <nl> If solo spellcasting was a nuanced practice for a more civilized age, then modern day casting was the rough, rusty cutting edge that the younger generation worked on. You didn't get one person to cast a long spell, keeping them up for several years while they stared at a book, you got a good group of people with silver tongues, and you weaved them together into spell symphonies. <nl> Akkron was at the door when I got home; he was doing his best impression of Mom's 'really?' look. "You're running late," he commented. <nl> "Balthy didn't break the record." <nl> "Did he have a chance?" Akkron asked as he undid the chain lock. <nl> "I thought he did for a bit," I said as I pulled on my tie to loosen it. "Woulda only been a few minutes either way." <nl> "You get the drinks?" Akkron asked as he waved me in. <nl> "Didn't think it was my turn," I answered. Had it been my turn? It was Akkron's turn last week which meant that- nah it wasn't me. <nl> "Reg couldn't make it so I texted you," Akkron answered, "whatever we can make some before starting." <nl> "Sure thing," I nodded and slung my bag off my shoulder onto the floor. I knew that he meant 'I' was going to make something instead of 'us.' That was my job in the group as a lead caster; I had to carry the spells when people had to take breaks. <nl> Actually, with how it turned out it mostly meant that they were covering for me when I needed a quick breath. <nl> The key with symphony casting was that people didn't just keep one another awake with small spells, we passed the spell from hand to hand rather than making one person say the entire thing. It let you cast faster, move quicker, the only issue was the occasional explosive reaction that happened when you crossed the wrong word, but that was why people called it bleeding edge, right? <nl> "You gonna do it?" Akkron asked as he kicked by bag further away from the door. <nl> "Sure thing," I sighed and started mumbling under my breath to get the drinks conjured for practice. It was only gonna take a minute, the spell wasn't had, and I wasn't about to take requests. <nl> Right around the end of the spell there was another knock at the door and Tiff came in without waiting for us to answer, she'd started letting herself in when Akkron and her had become a thing and hadn't stopped once they had. <nl> "That everyone?" she asked me when I was in the middle of casting. I motioned to my mouth to show that she was an idiot for asking me and she rolled her eyes. She walked away, and I started getting jugs out of the cabinets, so I didn't spill all over the counter. <nl> "Merevi," I finished, and the jugs all began to fill with fruit punch, it was my choice because I was casting the damn spell. <nl> "Ready for warmups?" Akkron called from the other room. That meant all six of us were here. <nl> "Skip me for the first lines," I yelled as I tried to get the jugs arranged so I could take them in all at once instead of making more than one trip. <nl> Akkron started the disc with the base for timing, and Tiff started to sing the spell. <nl> As soon as Tiffany spoke there was a different energy in the room, magic pulling on our tongues to try to guide us in the way that the spell was going to flow. We stopped being a group of friends and started being a group of advanturers on the white waters of casting. I took a deep breath to avoid speaking and breakin the spell as I brought drinks into the room. <nl> Tiff glared at me as I came into the room as if to say 'about time' instead of the incantation. She started half a word "Plyis-" <nl> "sirasi," I finished for her and I stole the reins of magic from her, tearing the paddle from her hands and adding my energy to our effort to fight the flow of the river. <nl> **to those interested I will be making a part 2 tomorrow on /r/Jacksonwrites based on /u/supremecrafters idea of 'awesome spells done quick.** <eos>

<sos> She kept her head down, walking through the city to her subway. Her headphones were in, but silent. Her glasses were dark, even though it was a cloudy day. Anything to avoid people. <nl> It wasn't that she didn't like people. In fact, she was envious of almost every human interaction she saw. Out of the corner of her eye, sitting on the train, a couple of teenagers laughed - carefree. A woman was having a very animated conversation with a friend across from her. Obviously new lovers fawned over each other at the back. That was what she envied most - love. At any stage. She especially would love to even suffer through a divorce. <nl> Instead, Hope knew she was cursed. Her shrink thought she was making this up, that it was just a series of coincidences that fueled her obsessive-compulsive traits. However, she knew better. <nl> Suddenly, a man sat beside her jostling into her backpack. "Sorry," he said sheepishly, "I am not used to the ramble of the train." Hope protectively brought her backpack up onto her lap and turned slightly away.  "I'm new to the city," the man persisted, ignoring her headphones. Perhaps he couldn't see them? "How long have you been here?". Idle chit-chat. If only she could risk speaking to him. It was her stop; she was saved from this tempting torture. <nl> Hope bustled out of the train, pulling her backpack on and walking briskly through the station. She bounded up the stairs in twos, enjoying the blast of the cool fall air on her face when she emerged. Hope walked the last block to her job, the most suitable job for her - record keeping at the city hall. She worked in the basement, mostly alone except for a dowdy old woman named Barb who kept to herself until she retired last month. Now Hope was in charge and left alone. She doubted if anybody even remembers she was there, to be honest. <nl> Just as Hope settled into her office, the man from the train flashed into the room smiling. <nl> "Oh hey! From the train!" He stated. His grin was charming and fearless. <nl> "I, ugh, can I help you?" Hope blurted. She almost had forgotten what her voice sounded like. Melodic, sweet, unworn by lack of use. <nl> "My apologies, I'm Tim - the new assistant record keeper. Apparently, a woman retired so I was lucky enough to nail this job. I moved here from New Jersey just last week; wow has it been a whirlwind, packing, finding a place, unpacking... Oh, I'm sorry," he paused, noticing her obvious bewilderment, "I tend to ramble!" <nl> Great. A man, and a rambler. A handsome man at that... "Okay... Tim... I'm Hope," she flushed, "well, I suppose let's get you trained." They stood staring at each other. Tim started to ramble again, about his family in New Jersey. 'This is going to be a long couple of weeks...' Hope thought, secretly praying there was something she wouldn't like about this man. <nl> _________________ <nl> I just can't understand my new co-worker, Hope. She was a beautiful, smart, and secretly witty woman who would suddenly shy away from any interaction with me. There was some sort of invisible line that I can't see, and when I cross it, she retreats into that head of hers with incredible speed. One minute her eyes would twinkle, the next, she may as well be wearing those dark sunglasses she seemed to wear like a child's safety blanket. <nl> Despite her retreats, I have to admit - I am infatuated. I decided to win her trust, no matter the cost. <nl> _________________ <nl> I cried when Tim left me flowers in my office. I cried like I hadn't cried in years. I read his note over and over and cried. I knew he'd be in soon, even though it was Saturday, because of his note: <nl> "Hope - I cannot get you out of my mind. When your eyes twinkle, my stomach flutters with joy. I want to spend every day, for as long as you let me, trying to make you smile. I know you planned on catching up today, but instead, I'll be by in the morning to finally do some touristy things you keep recommending. <nl> You're special, Hope. ~Tim" <nl> I looked at the clock. It had been an hour of crying, and I hadn't made a plan. An escape plan. How to get out of this? Do I flat out refuse? Tell him I'm a lesbian?? Okay, now I was just grasping at straws. Perhaps I would leave and pretend I had changed my mind? Yes! That's what... just then, the door opened. <nl> "Hope?" Tim said quietly, entering the office, "Did my note... upset you?" He could tell that I was crying. I'm sure anybody with a set of eyes could tell I was crying. <nl> "I...I..." I stuttered. <nl> "It's okay," Tim looked at his shoes, "I'll go." Not knowing what to say, my heart swelling with emotions, I let him leave in silence. <nl> I slumped into the chair, prepared for another round of horrible sobs to wrack over me. I reached for the note, just to torture myself again when a loud thump came from the basement door. <nl> "Tim?" I said quietly into the silence, not knowing why I thought that was him. A horrible thought came over me. A very dark, horrible thought that caused panic to rise up in my throat. <nl> "Tim!?" I flew to the door, logically knowing I was being ridiculous, but my fear couldn't be controlled. I whipped open the door, and suddenly it was all very real. <nl> Slumped against the door, Tim was bent at an unusual angle. He'd fallen down the cement stairs. He wasn't moving. I held a shaky hand by his face to feel his breath and found none. I fell on top of him, bile rising to my throat, not again! <nl> "Tim..." I choked out. How can this be? I didn't love him... wait, the flowers. The card. The tears, and then... when he left after seeing I was upset. I had fallen in love, of course I had. I was starved for any interaction, any kindness, and when he walked away he had done what others wouldn't. He showed me that he cared for me more than he cared about his ego or his feelings, and done what I had needed him to do. <nl> "Hope?" My heart stopped. I swear it stopped right then. Did he just..? "Hope?" Tim said again. Suddenly he was straightening up, bones were cracking, and he was standing. <nl> "Tim?!" I screeched, it echoed through the stairwell. <nl> "Hope, don't be frightened, please..." Tim looked shameful, embarrassed even. <nl> "What the fuck?!" I shouted, confused and shaken. "You were DEAD!" <nl> _________________ <nl> I looked into those terrified eyes, and it was like looking into a mirror. I had been careful to avoid anything dangerous all of my life. I took public transport instead of driving a car. I accepted a job in a records office, the most mundane safe thing I could think of. I rarely left my apartment, and I made sure that it was on the ground floor. The only thing I couldn't avoid were these damn stairs, and now she knew. <nl> "Hope I can explain..." I started, but honestly, I had no idea how to explain this. When I was a boy, I had fallen into a neighbours pool when nobody was around. I couldn't swim, and I knew I was a goner. I had sunk to the bottom when I could no longer keep my head above water. It burned as I took what I believed was my final breaths, but then the escape of death didn't come. I have no idea how long I waited to die until I simply got bored, as children do, and brought myself to safety. <nl> For years, I thought it was either a miracle or something I had dreamed up. That was until the car accident in high school. My best friend and his girlfriend were killed instantly, but I was left unscathed. I had felt every single bone break, even the puncture to my lung, and watched the blood pool around me. By the time the ambulance arrived, I didn't have a mark on me. I was immortal. <nl> I suddenly clutched Hope, the first person who even had an inkling of what I was, and whispered my story into her ear as she sobbed quietly into my chest. <nl> _________________ <nl> Tim was still hugging me. He had finished what seemed like ages ago, and it seemed impossible to process what he was saying. So instead, I shared my story. "Every man I've ever loved has died." I started. Despite the fact that Tim had just claimed immortality, years of therapy had me feeling foolish about this statement. It was a coincidence, bad luck, it was not real. This was not real. <nl> "My first serious boyfriend died in a car accident driving home after the first time we made love." I sputtered. <nl> "Then, years after his death, I fell in love in college. It was a whirlwind relationship, young love. Within two weeks, he fell off a balcony at a party." I looked at my hands, feeling guilty. That's when I started to have the thoughts that it was my fault. That I had somehow controlled these events, even when I wasn't there. After years of therapy and medication, I finally had the courage to date and I met my last love. No, my last victim. <nl> I was so careful with him. I took my time, keeping him at a distance for as long as I could. It lasted almost a year until he surprised me at my family's lake house, with a ring. He died that night in his sleep, right next to me. That was almost a decade ago now, but I saw his face every night in my dreams. Cold and lifeless. <nl> As I finished my story, the silence surrounding me was deafening. My head swirled with emotions and confusion. All of my beliefs were suddenly validated. It wasn't just a coincidence, it was real. Tim fell down these stairs and died too, just because I loved him... but he wasn't dead. He was immortal and standing before me despite my flaws. Despite my curse that had taken three others. <nl> "Hope," Tim broke the silence. I looked up at him. He smiled, "Do you believe in soul mates?" <eos>

<sos> "What happens after I finish watching them all?" asked Evelyn. <nl> "Well," came the voice, rich, warm, calm, patient. Evelyn couldn't see her, but the lady sounded like Ms Perrine at school, who always had time and a kind word for them. "There's no rush, really. You can stay here as long as you like, watching them over and over again. When you're done, like, *really done*, you can let me know." <nl> "And then?" <nl> "You may then pass on," said the voice. "Your body on earth... expires." <nl> "Oh," said Evelyn. "What's there after that?" <nl> "Nothing," said the voice. <nl> The ten crystalline balls (Evelyn made sure to count them) hovered in the air, floating in that dark, inky room. Evelyn was reminded of the conservatory she had visited during her school's science camp, where her class had been ushered into a similarly-darkened auditorium. Stars, planets, constellations had flooded the ceiling of the auditorium, one after the other, sparkling and glittering like so many diamonds out of reach. <nl> "That's number 4," said the voice. "You're thinking of number 4. Timothy even grabbed your hand during the lightshow, and didn't let go until just before the lights came back on." <nl> Right on cue, the fourth crystal from the left shimmered an azure blue, begging for Evelyn to reach out and touch it. "Oh no, you can see that too!" said Evelyn, laughing as she covered her cheeks which had gone aflame. <nl> "There are nine others like that one," said the voice, "the top ten important moments in your life. Pick and choose, take your time. Only when you're ready need you move on." <nl> Evelyn reached out instinctively, the excitement bubbling up in her. This was better than any vlog or video she could ever hope to compose on her own. Previews of her memories, perfectly captured and rendered, played out under her fingertips. She realised how lucky she was as each of the crystals yielded their secrets to her, for they invariably contained happy, cheerful memories. Evelyn cycled through the first few, loathe to move on, immersing herself over and over in that endless bliss of a charmed life. <nl> Then, a thought occurred to her. <nl> "I... I don't remember dying," Evelyn said, brows furrowed. "It's hazy, for some reason." <nl> "You're technically still alive," said the voice. "But if you're curious, events leading up to it will be in the last crystal. It always counts as the last significant event, for obvious reasons." <nl> "Will... I be sad if I watch it?" asked Evelyn. <nl> "It depends," said the voice. "Don't forget, there's always the other nine to cheer you right back up." <nl> Evelyn hesitated, torn between the first nine crystals and the last one. She knew her mind was playing tricks on her, because where the ten of them were indistinguishable before, now the last one seemed ominous, forbidden. She found her fingers trembling just reaching out to that last crystal, and then that impulse again to lose herself in the first nine, to leave that door unopened. <nl> After all, the rest really were all that she needed - one was the day that her family adopted Ginny, that floppy golden retriever who had a penchant for chewing on her soft toys. Another was the day that her parents brought Sara home from the hospital, the sister she had always longed for. So many memories, so many *good* memories, all within reach, all begging for endless consumption. <nl> Never be afraid to make the tough choice, her dad's motto sounded in her head. <nl> Evelyn sighed, then reached out for the last crystal. It unfolded when she touched it, the way a touch-me-not would, but in reverse, and light spilled out, bathing the room in an orangey glow. Shapes and sounds and feelings and thoughts coalesced around her, and for a moment it felt like she was back in the moment, reliving that very memory. Evelyn recognised the scene immediately. <nl> "Such a beautiful drive," said the voice. "You were playing all the way with your sister, were you not?" <nl> "Yes," said Evelyn. "Six hours to Disneyland, Dad said. The hours flew by though. We talked about school, Sara told me about the boy she had a crush on, we napped, we snacked, we counted the number of cars which passed us..." <nl> Then, the memory cut off, dousing the room back in an oily gloom. It looped again soon after, right back where it first started, as if it had never stopped in the first place. <nl> "That's all I remember of it?" asked Evelyn. <nl> "That's all you witnessed," offered the voice. <nl> "Can you tell me... what happened after that?" <nl> A short silence, and for a moment Evelyn wondered if the voice had gone away. It returned just as Evelyn thought to ask the question again. <nl> "There aren't any rules about this," said the voice, "and I don't suppose there's any harm in it. There was an accident, Evelyn. Someone else had fallen asleep at the wheel, drifted into your lane." <nl> "That's not good," said Evelyn. "Are... they ok? Mum, Dad? Sara?" <nl> "They're fine. All of them. In fact, they're right there beside you now, watching and waiting for you to recover. There are machines hooked up to you, keeping you alive... but just barely." <nl> Evelyn looked back at the other crystals, and then it occurred to her why they seemed so familiar. "Time moves differently here, doesn't it," she said, flitting through the other memories. "How long have I been here, looking through these?" <nl> "Not that long," said the voice. <nl> "How long?" <nl> "About a year?" <nl> Evelyn smiled, then released the crystal she had been holding in her hand. It rose slowly, floating up to join the others, until they were arranged neatly in a row again. She couldn't deny that it was nice being here, looking back at the memories, reliving them, savouring them. <nl> Knowing that her family was out there waiting for her to return though, took some of that shine away. She didn't like to keep anyone waiting. <nl> "I'm ready." <nl> "You sure?" asked the voice. <nl> "Yes," Evelyn said. <nl> --- <nl> /r/rarelyfunny <eos>

<sos> May had asked several times to go home, but the captain said that he no longer remembered where Earth was located. He had gotten the coordinates from a trading partner, and after they had abducted her he had overwritten that file with a note to the cleaning crew. *Make sure the human gets watered.* <nl> That had been an unpleasant and terrifying awakening, but soon the crew knew the basics of human care. She was just lucky that the captain came from an oxygen based planet and she hadn't died. They told her stories of other ships filled with water or different gasses, some of the stranger aliens looking forlorn at the tanks on their heads. <nl> They started out giving her small tasks, but soon she graduated to some of the most important jobs on the ship. Most of the crew needed 2 to 3 times the sleep she did, so she often ended up running the engine room by herself. May hadn't known anything about engines before, but the one in this ship was so simple and optimized that it wasn't difficult to learn. This astounded her crewmates, as they all had the equivalent of a bachelor's degree to understand it. <nl> The artificial gravity on the spacecraft was extremely light. While others walked or slithered normally, she could cover a room in a single bound. May thought this was actually very fun and, since she was much smaller than the rest of the crew, was asked to do many repairs in high or hard to reach places. She really didn't mind. <nl> She soon became the captain's favorite, though he treated her more as a pet than a person. He found a planet that grew cocoa beans and would regularly buy chocolate just for her. She made sure to handle these boxes herself, as the chocolate was toxic to the rest of the crew. <nl> As for the crew themselves, they treated her with cautious respect. They would joke around with her but would avoid upsetting her at all costs. It may have had something to do with her accidentally shattering a ceramic plate once. She felt like she was always stopping them from doing stupid things, such as grabbing live wires and making sure they wore their protective suits when doing outside repairs. She felt like a mom sometimes. <nl> That's why when they passed a little planet in a tiny galaxy that looked quite familiar, she chose to say nothing. May was already home. <eos>

<sos> She expected it to be beautiful. <nl> Rolling meadows, fields of wild flowers, the wild scent of fresh lavender and cedar. <nl> "I love you," he would proclaim. <nl> "Your beauty burns, your eyes torture, your body torments me." <nl> Blah, blah, blah. <nl> She'd found him riveting at one point, a young woman drifting through life rather aimlessly, unable to discern a true purpose, but instead filled with an indelible lack of purpose. <nl> Jazz clubs, disco clubs, dance clubs, they all were the same to her now. <nl> A different part of her remembers the draw, the pull towards intoxicants and their inevitable fallout, that heartless love born of mindless lust. <nl> There she met a God. <nl> 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, the years blew her by. <nl> How he loved her, he claimed.  How he needed her, he would croon. <nl> Lust.  A woman can live a few lifetimes and still be a fool. <nl> She still remembered, a smoke filled bar shortly after the Japs surrendered, a young man in a tan suit reclining at a restricted table, laughing wildly and drinking liberally as women seemed to fawn over him. <nl> She had found him rather dull.  Repulsive, in fact. <nl> Unfortunately, that provoked him into paying attention to her. <nl> First mistake. <nl> Around building corners, at parties, at the fucking grocery store he would appear, always charming and handsome, but somewhat wrong.  Always off. <nl> She ignored her instinct and decided to give him a chance. <nl> Second mistake. <nl> He would sing to her, play music to her, recite poems and laud her with praise.  A pedestal he placed her upon, which at first seemed delightful.  Until his narcissism kicked in. <nl> Don't go here, don't talk to them, stay inside, do what I say. <nl> So a woman refuses. <nl> Then POOF, here comes a God, an OLD God, one who has been long forgotten but beds those who least expect him. <nl> And old Gods carry magic. <nl> She would scorn him, ignore him, beg him to leave her, but he would not.  He simply adored her more. <nl> Then the third strike. <nl> He gave her a terminal disease. <nl> He needed her to be in his grasp forever, to always be at his beck and call, to satisfy him whenever he so chose. <nl> Total bullshit.  A curse. <nl> She died in a rather unenthusiastic manner, a car T-boned her ass rather well.  Instantaneous death.  No pain. <nl> She awoke in a tomb, or what seemed to be a tomb.  The air held heavy, tasting of copper and cedar, a thick orange smoke pervading the space. <nl> Unable to reason, she crawled forward.  She did not know why, but simply complied.  The unwillingness of the dead. <nl> She arose, confused and scared, in what appeared to be a metropolis from a different time. <nl> All full of women. <nl> She moved forward, confounded by what she saw, a thousand languages and a million women, all bartering and fighting and scrapping. <nl> An elderly woman, perhaps in her late seventies stopped and stared. <nl> "New here?" she asked, carrying a bundle of something. <nl> A nod in response. <nl> "What a shame." <nl> Shocked silence. <nl> "Shall I show you around?" <nl> A dull nod. <nl> "Come with me, child, and I can tell you how to avoid him." <nl> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <nl> Wander. <nl> Thin streets, wide streets.  Those that smell of roses and thyme, and those that smell of shit and disease. <nl> She is scared and alone here.  Dead or undying, she cannot discern.  Rather, there is only a sense of dread.  A woman deceived through the old trickery of forgotten lords and Gods, those whose names cannot be recalled, but are only remembered by the dead.  In a world of mist and blackness, a great hall of missing corpses. <nl> Ahead of her, a woman leads.  By hand and wrist she pulls and drags, revealing newer and wider plazas and passages.  Somehow, her age is stripped by her movements, every patch of time showing a younger and freer version of this woman.  She was someone else, long ago.  Someone dead and gone. <nl> The recently dead woman finds herself following a long dead woman, into a passage of columns.  Some drip with blood, other with milk and honey.  Either way, she knows not to touch the massive pillars of limestone. <nl> Others are meant to lick the sweet and metallic taste of blood. <nl> She finds herself descending, not through stairs but a ramp, flanked by walls of a strange earthy substance.  There is not a method of surveillance of any human kind, but the strange eyes of the Gods bore through her nape. <nl> Ambrosia, mead, wine, beer, meat, jerky all blend together, pouring through her nostrils.  Those who wander the land of the dead are either damned or blessed.  Yet here she wafts, being neither. <nl> The woman places a hand against her cheek, a thin smile cresting over sharpened teeth. <nl> "Those of our beauty must take extraordinary measures." <nl> She reaches below, placing a crown of tangled statuesque snakes upon the woman's head. <nl> "I served my time, as Helen of Troy." <nl> The crown begins to writhe, alive in its own right. <nl> "To hide from his advances, we rely on the power of other Gods." <nl> Wildness through her hair, snakes through her scalp twist among the hairs there.  A monster is her reduction.  She recalls the fables and myths, but cannot reconcile the reality.  Death is eternal.  Is she to be a monster for eternity? <nl> Gods of every faith and denomination cannot breach her power, however. <nl> But she finds herself, clutching her knees and weeping.  She misses her mother and clouds.  She misses her father and brother, her sisters and her friends.  She does not want to be dead, she wants to fight this being who has relegated her to this darkness. <nl> Now she can only feel hate and rage, clasping fingertips, almost sensing throats below them, satisfied by the life lost beneath them. <nl> The woman has dissipated into a smoke, but what remains is a being consumed in hate.  She did not ask for an Old God, nor did she offer any sacrifice. <nl> The snakes wriggle within her hair, and it makes her happy.  Others will submit to this newfound power. <nl> She feels an unremarkable call to the lost metropolis.  To fight this Old God, to regain her freedom.  To have a life of her own, to find her family and apologize for her sins.  She wanted the best for them, but the lust of a Dead God forced her into this state. <nl> Medusa is a weakling, Athena is a cunt. <nl> She is vengeance incarnate, blessed with the power of the unwilling dead. <nl> She will go home. <nl> Her captor will suffer. <nl> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <nl> r/storiesfromapotato <eos>

<sos> Elena was a matryoshka painter.  At sunset, the woodworker Anatoly would knock on the apartment door with his wheelbarrow beside him.  Anatoly would give Elena all the plain figurines that he had carved that day, curving the balsam wood into the prospect of a head, shoulders and torso, then cutting the doll at her waist so that her legs would twist off, and hide her secrets.  Elena would pay Anatoly five hundred rubles for each full matryoshka and then she would go to her workshop (which was in fact only just the corner of her father's kitchen behind the stove) and she would paint the wood into beautiful women. <nl> Elena would paint the women with long eyelashes and blushing cheeks, and Elena would wonder what it would feel like to blush and flutter her own eyes, if ever a kind and handsome man were to pour vodka into a glass, and hand it to her, letting his fingertips pass over hers.  She would paint the women wearing elegant dresses adorned with tulips and roses, and Elena would imagine sewing an elegant silk dress to wear herself.  She would give the woman full-hearted smiles, and Elena would try to remember the last time she had smiled, apart from when she meant to attract the customers to her booth at the Udelnaya.  And then she would paint the next doll nested within, more intricately, but otherwise the same.  However, at their core, Elena's matryoshka contained a protest: open her dolls up to the final girl, the smallest and deepest girl of all, and you will find that she is not smiling or blushing, but instead has short eyelashes and a stern gaze. She wears only a plain grey dress.  For though Elena painted matryoshka, she had never known her own mother, and therefore knew that not all daughters will inherit. <nl> In the morning, Elena would pack her matryoshka in a box and take the bus to the Udelnaya, hoping to sell her work.  Most days, she would be lucky to sell two or three matryoshka.  But there was one day when she sold none at all, yet left the Udelnaya joyful. On that day, a certain tall man in a white dress shirt had come to the market.  There, he saw Elena at her booth with the shelves of matryoshka behind her, all red and green, gold and blue, and the man was enamored. <nl> "I have never seen a woman who I am more certain has a secret hiding inside her," the man said to Elena.  He was wearing a gold watch and many silver rings.  Elena told him that he could buy as many matryoshka as he wished, and discover everything within them.  But then the man said the woman he meant to describe was not any of the matryoshka, but Elena herself. <nl> The man gave Elena a piece of paper with directions to an elegant restaurant on the banks of the Moyka River. He he gave her his credit card as well.  He told Elena that were she to go buy a nice dress, that he would be honored to see her in it, and dine with her that evening.  Elena blushed, and then she smiled, even though she had not sold a matryoshka. <nl> That evening, instead of painting, Elena went to the best boutique in St Petersburg, and she bought a beautiful silk dress.  She then met the man at the appointed restaurant.  He spread caviar onto crackers for her, and poured her some vodka.  He asked her about her life, how many matryoshka she supposed she had painted, and if any were very special to her.  But, as the meal continued, Elena began to feel more and more confused and dizzy, until everything became terribly blurry.  When Elena awoke, she was no longer in the restaurant or in the small bed beside her father's.  She was standing upright, but frozen in pose, perched on a gold podium in a white expanse, more still and desolate than the Tauride Gardens after the first snowfall.  Elena was lined up neatly between a hundred other young women, all immobile as well. <nl> "Where am I" Elena asked, "who are you all?" <nl> "That man who gave you a dress and dinner," the young woman beside her explained, "was not in truth a man, but the wicked god of Motherless Girls.  He keeps us here as figurines, upon his shelf for all eternity.  He tells us that long ago, he once loved a goddess called Anna, who also had no mother, who was the First Woman, and that we remind him of her.  When Anna birthed their child, the girl was mortal.  So the god sought to kill the child as an abomination.  But Anna loved the baby, so she fled the heavens to the Barsky taiga.  The god chased her all through the trees, but Anna refused to return, and at last a bargain was struck: she would remain in the Barsky with her daughter, but thereafter Anna would become mortal as well.  But, if any of her descendants to ever live without a mother, the god would be entitled to reclaim those girls and bring them here, to remain forever in his collection." <nl> Elena was crestfallen at the thought of never again seeing her father or St Petersburg, and of being frozen in place.  She screamed out to the god of Motherless Girls and demanded to be freed.  But the god just laughed, all throughout his menagerie. <nl> But then, after many days of considering her plight, Elena formed a plan.  "Allow me to turn your collection into matryoshka!," she called out to the god, "Let me separate each of these women into pieces, into clear layers, so that you might consider each part of her more easily, and find what it is in each of us that resembles your beloved Anna!" <nl> Elena's proposal thrilled the god, for even after all his abductions, he was still no closer to grasping what it was that makes a motherless woman so special, so like the First Woman.  He released Elena's muscles and demanded that she go to work at once, separating and straining each of his women into a partwise matryoshka. <nl> From where the god watched, it appeared to him Elena was doing as she had promised.  But each time his back was turned, or when Elena carefully angled her subject and stood nose to nose, she would reach inside the girl, and she would pull forth her soul, which lives in her deepest layer.  Elena would hide the soul in her bosom until she could move on and quietly feed it to another girl, until every girl had taken in the soul of one of her fellow captives.  Finally, Elena pulled out her own soul and fed it to the woman whom she had been first placed beside.  At last, each captive woman had taken in the soul of another, thereby promising to care for it and nurture it.  Because of this, the women of the menagerie had all become mothers to each other, and were no longer in thrall to the selfish god. <nl> The god saw that Elena was no longer hard at work, so he returned to inspect her progress.  But as he entered the menagerie, all the captives suddenly broke from their poses.  All together, they hit and kicked the god, until he fled.  The menagerie with all its gold podiums vanished, and the girls fell through a void, until everything again became blurry. Elena awoke in her small bed in her father's apartment in St Petersburg. <nl> That night, Anatoly came at sunset with the blank wood for Elena.  For the first time, she did not paint the final doll with a stern face and grey dress.  For now, Elena knew that somewhere there was a woman who would always carry her soul, always nurture and protect it, and that this meant she would always have a mother to inherit from. <eos>

<sos> Her appearance was close enough to resemble human, but she was much taller with two pairs of lithe arms, and eyes that were as dark as ink wells. She stood before her throne and looked down upon a crowd of various races. <nl> Calmly, "Tell it to me again." she said. Commanding her room full of advisors that gathered. Her restrained rage was unnerving to her subjects, they all knew she was furious. <nl> There was a shove from one of the advisors, pushing another foreward. A man with blue skin and long feeler like appendages coming out of his head. He too was near human in apperance. <nl> "Well..." He struggled to find the words. "From what we surmize... After initial seeding of the planet... They developed according to predictions." He paused for a moment. <nl> "And then?" Said the empress. <nl> "Well, in their history they developed something called 'democracy', and they strayed from the proper systems of governance. It spread like a cancer ever since." <nl> "What of their kings and queens?" She said. "The central powers of nations?" <nl> "Well... Reduced to figure heads. Now the entire planet has become a democracy and--after a brief rule on their fourth planet, Elon Musk King of Mars... There hasn't been a ruling monarchy since. They each vote and have equal say on their leaders and law." <nl> "And what of my daughters?" She said. "Did they at least find suitable 'leaders' in their government to strengthen our alliances?" <nl> "They... Are refusing to marry, and are choosing to stay among the humans. They are saying they have the right to choose what they do with their lives." <nl> There was a murmur in the crowds as they begun to consider the host of strange new ideas they have been receiving from the humans, and they considered the implications. <nl> The empress nodded... "Send the fleet. Glass the planets." <eos>

<sos> The air stinks of false pleasantries. <nl> Around a table, representatives of the mightiest empire the galaxy had ever known sits across from the upstarts in the Sol system.  A cybernetically enhanced group of humanoid creatures bearing a striking resemblance to the species of emperors and empresses.  Only a primary difference in skin color and texture, slightly metallic as a natural evolution to a heavily radiated environment. <nl> A human delegation rises and give bows of feigned respect.  They have something they call a United Nations governing their systems and colonies, making communicative talks difficult.  Too many humans have too many different forms of power.  No way to isolate and eliminate their leadership.  Their defining characteristic a hatred among their species for different beliefs, governments, even skin colors.  But all humans share one common attribute. <nl> An intense hatred of all alien races.  The way they see it, humans would rather wipe out all opposing life, in order to focus on kill each other.  Can't exactly blame them.  The empire hadn't made a peaceful first contact. <nl> The empress rises and gives a slight nod.  Her generals and entourage fume, such respect is unworthy of such an entitled race. <nl> Humans are fickle.  Loud, violent, loving, hopeful, arrogant, intelligent, idiotic.  No one set of morals defines them. <nl> Nearly limitless resources, ships, armies, planets and systems kneel before her throne.  Every other race would bow and scrape, awed at the magnificence of the Imperial Fleet and the limitless might of the Empire. <nl> Not the humans. <nl> There is silence.  Neither side aims to move first. <nl> The empress waves a hand.  A signal. <nl> A smartly dressed General rises, puffs out his chest, and reads into a translator. <nl> "We are willing to discuss terms for an armistice." <nl> Stone faced humans.  No emotions from them, and no body language to express any kind of reaction.  Perhaps the electronics make them unable to feel. <nl> A human stands and speaks into his translator, as another moves a document towards the imperial delegation.  One rises to take it, and opens it before the Empress. <nl> "We have terms.  They are non-negotiable." <nl> The Empress can sense the fury of her generals, some of their arms quiver with rage.  Their teeth are clenched, eyes narrowed. <nl> She reads the terms. <nl> Immediate cessation of all conflict. <nl> Tributes of various sorts, technological, material, financial. <nl> Trade policies specifically benefiting human settlements. <nl> Surrender of nearly four dozen star systems near their Sol system. <nl> Dissolution of the Empire. <nl> She makes a brief comment and the General stands again, speaking into that black box.  If he grips it any harder it will shatter. <nl> "We cannot agree to the dissolution of the empire." <nl> The humans stand in unison, sighing as if they've heard a terrible joke. <nl> "Either agree to the terms, or we will employ them by force." <nl> The aliens rise.  It is futile, true.  Human weapons are too precise, their drones vastly outnumbering her own pilots.  Every ship in her invincible army outclassed and outgunned. <nl> But she had her pride. <nl> She turned to leave, condemning her people to death. <nl> Humans would talk about the first contact war as a minor spat.  Ancient cultures ground into dust by their own hands. <nl> None had pity for the dead. <nl> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <nl> r/storiesfromapotato <eos>

<sos> "Usually when we first contact a civilization, it is very easy to get them under our banner..." The Empress sighed. "...Not the humans though." <nl> The assembled collection of interplanetary rulers looked on, faces carefully blank as to not show any emotion that might set their imperial ruler into a rage. Long has it been since the Empress claimed her throne amongst the many countless galaxies she had enslaved, and since then her temper has been legendary for its ferociousness. <nl> "They are..." the Empress started, before trailing off as if the very words she needed had eluded her. "They are beyond our understanding." <nl> The gathered conglomerate of rulers collectively gasped, all pretense of decor abandoned in the face of what their ruler had just stated. The Empress was a rock, an infallible source of leadership and knowledge. To admit that there was something that was beyond her was so rare that none of the species present, some of which lived for centuries, could not remember a moment where it had happened before. <nl> A brave Clixperr, a race of blue-skinned, four eyed insectoids, raised his hand. "Err, your highness? What do you mean? I mean no disrespect, but I find it hard to believe that those... Dirt Walkers... could be beyond you." <nl> The Empress' left antennae twitched, which was usually the first and only sign any creature got before they were removed from existence. Instead of incinerating the creature who dared talk out of turn, however, the Empress simply closed her eyes and took a deep breath, before answering. <nl> "They are... a confusing sort," the Empress replied, temporarily forgiving her subject. "They don't react the way most sentient creatures do." <nl> No one spoke without being addressed this time. Life flashed before their eyes once. It was more than enough for one day. Noticing the obedient silence, the Empress continued. <nl> "Our scouting drones reported back a backwater civilization. They are barely out of Beta Stage of development." <nl> Most aliens at the Empress' table shared a condoned laugh. Beta Stage of Civilized Development was the point where a civilization stopped fighting each other over resourced deemed valuable in the Alpha Stage, and started working coherently toward space travel. <nl> There hadn't been a Beta Stage planet in millennia. <nl> The different creatures reveled in their mockery for scant minutes more before the Empress spoke up once more, her silent words cutting through the chatter like a knife. "And yet, their technology has already reached that of Nevulon Five's." <nl> Nevulon Five, while not the most technologically advanced of the planets under the Empress' rule, was among the best regardless. The room fell into silence once more. <nl> "But... how?" a commander asked. The Empress, apparently feeling generous, let him keep his life as well. Such was the extent that the humans unnerved her. <nl> "We... are unable to tell," the Empress sighed. "That is but an example of a much bigger, underlying problem." The Empress leaned forward, and as one, every other person in the room leaned back. "The humans squabble. They have clear, unrestrained hatred for one another, and everything in our databases say they should take themselves out. And yet... they don't. They continue to thrive amongst each other even though most of their technological and sociological advances are based towards killing each other. They adapt to harsh environments for the sole purpose of proving a point, and they constantly ingest near toxic substances and perform near deadly feats to simply prove they can." <nl> The room was deathly silent. No one dared utter a word about such odd, terrifying creatures. <nl> "Honestly, they are quite impressive. Quite insane, but in a way that would be entertaining. I believe we should extend every courtesy to get them to join. All those against?" <nl> No one dared oppose. The question was a challenge, not a request. <nl> "Good. Meeting adjourned." <nl> As the creatures left, the Empress smiled a wicked smile. She told none of them of the humans' tendency to conquer. They would no doubt go on a spree to eliminate everyone weaker than them, most likely starting with the weaker planets in her own kingdom. <nl> At worse? They would overthrow her. At best, they would whip the more pathetic ones into shape. The Empress shrugged, at least it would be amusing. <nl> And most entertaining indeed. <eos>

<sos> Welcome to Magnolia: a city without birth, without death; a city where all your dreams become reality, until you've lived them so God-damned often that they become a waking nightmare. Welcome to Magnolia: a city where our leading doctors will Skim off the last few hundred years of your life as if they were only fat deposits on your thighs, so that you can enjoy the thrills and spills of living all over again.  Welcome to Magnolia: a city that's rotten to its core and whose denizens are as dry as tinder, who are only waiting for a spark to ignite them and turn them into a raging inferno. <nl> That spark's name might be Richard Eizenstat. He's at the very least responsible for the placid pool of red that's stained my boots; he's responsible for Doctor Omin's body, that lies like a pale island in the center of the blood. <nl> "Thank you for coming," says a pretty woman in a black suit standing at the edge of the red shore, being careful not to get a single drop on her perfectly polished shoes. I recognise her from the holos. <nl> "Why'd he do it?" I ask, my voice an echoing growl around the small room. <nl> "He... he was a sick man, Mr O'connell. Very sick." The lady taps the side of her head twice. "Cerebral haemorrhage during the Step-Back." <nl> I frown. "Step-Backs don't go wrong. Isn't that your slogan?" <nl> "Our *slogan*, if you must call it that, is One Step-Back, Two Steps Forward." <nl> "My mistake. Still, I've never heard of a Step-Back going wrong before." <nl> "Well this one did," she replies sternly. <nl> The institution's white room is empty apart from us. She doesn't want this news getting out. I crouch down over the body, my knees hovering an inch above the blood. The corpse is cold and the arms are stiff but pliable. *Just*. <nl> "Maybe five hours since death, I reckon." <nl> A dozen or so wide wounds lattice the expired doctor's torso. A long, triangular shard of glass lies by his side. There's blood along the tip of the glass, where it stabbed the doctor, and there's blood all down its sides, too. Richard Eizenstat's hands must be pretty messed up right now. I wonder why he'd stab him so many times? It's like a *crime passionnel*, as the ancient Europeans might have said. <nl> "Come, follow me," says the lady. "I have something I need to show you." <nl> She leads me through one of the institutions hallways full of locked iron doors, and I'm already burning with curiosity. I hear noises from within the rooms: scraping, banging... *screaming*. If nothing ever goes wrong during the Step-Backs, then who the hell are behind those doors? <nl> We come out into a small room with an expensive looking table in the middle -- authentic wood, by the look of it. A deep, rich brown -- mahogany, maybe -- with decorative carvings around its eves. Thing must be worth as much as my apartment. <nl> Two chairs sit either side of the table. It's the type of room I'd have done interrogations in, once upon a time. Although, with a cheap pine table between us instead, with a couple of stained mugs full of steaming coffee marking its surface. <nl> "Sit, please," she says. It's a demand not a request -- same with all the bullshit questions she asks. I pull out a chair and slump down onto it. <nl> "You perhaps know who I am, already?" <nl> I grin. "I wouldn't be much of a detective if I didn't. Juliet Browning. Daughter of Jonathan Browning, once of the three founders of Magnolia. As pretty as you are ruthless... *so they say*." <nl> For the first time since meeting her, she allows herself a smile. "Oh, do *they*? How nice of them. And I suppose you know why I've asked for your help?" <nl> "Seeing as I'm the only detective in the city -- the only person with any real experience with murder cases, I suspect you need me. I mean... *a dead body*?" I let out a slow whistle. "That's already going to look bad against your record. And if the killer doesn't get caught... well, it'll be historic, to say the least." <nl> "He won't get away!" she shouts, slamming a fist hard against the table. Almost instantly, Juliet returns to her equable demeanour. "You will see to that, I am sure of it. Now, tell me, Mr O'connell-" <nl> "David." <nl> "*David.* Why is you still have your memories from during the Restart? Surely it would be best for you to erase them -- they can't be pleasant to hold onto." <nl> I flinch. "They're not. But I figured someone has to keep these skills alive. Murder doesn't wait forever. Immortality is bullshit -- all we've done is cure ageing. And even that means nine hours a night in a vecta-coffin." <nl> She cringes. "I do so hate that name. You will call it the Restorative Cube, from here on." <nl> I shrug. <nl> Juliet stares at me, drinking me in. I imagine most people find her stony gaze imposing, but I just stare right back. <nl> "You must be so very bored," she says lugubriously. <nl> "I've only just gotten here. Besides, you're not so dull." <nl> She laughs. "Not of this. *Of everything*. Of life. Of living. You must have done everything possible a hundred times over, and yet you've not had your memory Reset. You're somewhat of a freak, David." <nl> "I prefer *unique*. Tell me about Eizenstat." <nl> "It... happened two months ago. The Step-Back failure. He... his mind, his *memories* have leaked into each other. He doesn't know what's reality, and what's fiction. A holomovie from last year, for example -- he can no longer tell if it happened to him in real life, if *he* was the protagonist -- or if it was indeed just a holomovie." <nl> "So..." <nl> "So, he has a lot of dangerous memories right now. He believes he has inherited many of these memories not from movies, but from other denizen's Skims.... Skims from before the Restart." <nl> "*Before?*" <nl> "Yes." <nl> "That's..." I whistle. "Those memories would be from long before even my time. And hell, I'm as old as they come." <nl> "If they were real memories, yes. But they aren't. They are fabrications." <nl> "So, you're saying he thinks that movies he's watched are *real* memories, but from other people. People's memories from Before." <nl> "Exactly. He's paranoid beyond reason." <nl> Juliet opens a drawer and takes out a large brown folder. She slides it across the desk to me. "It is best you know what you're up against." <nl> "What happens once I've caught him?" <nl> "He's a heretic. We Reset him. There is no choice." <nl> "And to me?" <nl> "We Skim your memory back two days prior to this meeting, and for you none of this ever happened." <nl> "Then why the hell would I help you? What's the point?" <nl> "Your bank account will know what you did. Your new apartment will know, and your new -Platinum Forged memories will know. Beyond that, you will have done your city a great favour that won't be forgotten -- at least, not by me." <nl> I grunt, then nod and flip open the folder. <nl> > **Richard Eizenstat with Doctor Omin** <nl> > **Session one** <nl> > Omin: What is your name? <nl> > Eizenstat: Polynomine <nl> > Omin: Polynomine? <nl> > Eizenstat: We have many names. <nl> > Omin: Your name is Richard Eizenstat. <nl> > Eizenstat: We were Richard Eizenstat. We are now more. Many more. Much more. <nl> > Omin: Your name is Richard Eizenstat and you experienced an accident during Step-Back. <nl> > Eizenstat: There was no accident. <nl> > Omin: What do you mean? <nl> > Eizenstat: Someone wanted us to become what we are. To see what there was and is and will be. <nl> > Omin: ... you believe someone sabotaged the Step-Back? <nl> > Eizenstat: Yes. <nl> > Omin: Who? <nl> > Eizenstat: We don't know. There are many voices in our head and they bay for justice like starving wolves: uncontrollable and savage. We cannot control them yet. We can not quieten them enough to hear the voice beneath. <nl> > Omin: What is your first memory? <nl> > Eizenstat: We have many first memories. <nl> > Omin: What do you know of the Restart? <nl> > Eizenstat: It is a lie. There was no Restart. <nl> > Omin: A lie? <nl> > Eizenstat: We are taught what it is. A perfect new beginning. But it is not. <nl> > Omin: Then what was it? <nl> > Eizenstat: The mass extinction of humanity. <nl> > Omin: Extinction? What caused this *extinction*? <nl> > Eizenstat: Clones. <nl> > Omin: *Clones?* <nl> > Eizenstat: Yes, clones. Like, you Doctor. This body too, Doctor. But -- but there is humanity left. It is inside our head. And we will set them free! We will set them all free! <nl> > *Notes*: Eizenstat's eyes dilate massively as he screams and struggles against his restraints, the metal biting into his wrists until they bleed. I call in security and they apply the tranquilliser to his neck. It takes five minutes or so for his body to go limp. It should have taken seconds. <nl> > **End of session one** <nl> I look away from the document and up at Juliet who seems to be studying my face. <nl> "Clones?" I ask. <nl> "Outlawed tech, even before the Restart. Marked as abominations." <nl> "Yeah, I know... It's just a surprise to me that he thinks clones could be responsible, seeing as they were never anything more than an idea. " <nl> "Yes, you would think that." Juliet sighs. "I suppose I should be honest with you, you'll forget it all soon enough. Sometime before the Reset -- even I don't know all the details -- a handful of clones were produced for limited, closed testing. But... there was an incident..." <nl> "We created clones? Jesus..." I raise my eyebrows as I consider the implications. "So, what was incident?" <nl> "There's very little information on it, even in our own archives -- as is the case with anything pre-Reset. But what we do know is that something went wrong during the closed testing. What exactly, we can't say. But suffice it to say, clones never made it to market release, and any research into them was destroyed and made illegal thereafter. Instead, we concentrated on limited AI subserviencey." <nl> "So he could be telling the truth? I mean, not fully -- but maybe there's something in it?" <nl> "No. There's *no* possibility of it." <nl> I nod and return to the document. <nl> --- <nl> Part 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/7c0viz/wp_everyone_is_immortal_in_the_distant_future_to/ <nl> Part 3: https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/7c1pt0/wp_everyone_is_immortal_in_the_distant_future_to/ <eos>

<sos> **Yes, Yes!  This will be perfect, my most fiendish plan yet.** A shadowy sat at an immense desk made from black iron and ebony hued wood, a long quill that radiated a fell aura scratched eerily on a roll of parchment.  The room flickered with light from the fire place, a scent of spice and dark earth permeated the air.  The figure was immense, looming over the desk, wings sprouted from its back and flapped unconsciously, swirling the air.  Its focus was totally on the work before it, arcane symbols and script written in neat handwriting. <nl> The heavy iron door slid open slowly on oiled hinges.  Small clicks of talons on stone preceded a thin wisp of an individual, they strode into the chamber with inhuman grace.  Her figure oozed confidence, allure, seductive danger that lies just beneath the surface of her motions.  Cold yellow eyes with stilted pupils gazed at the shadow figure, a curve of a cruel lip hinted at a smile and she stood at its side in silence.  Eventually she coughs, a quiet noise that shot across the room. <nl> **Ah, Esmeralda.  What brings you to my chamber.** The shadow didn't turn from its task, continuing to write and make other hidden notes on an other scroll of parchment. <nl> The woman bowed, arm sweeping out in an old fashioned gesture.  "My Dread Lord Vel'tora, Lord of Shadows, Knight of the Ebon Chalice.  Doom scribe, Chronicler of the Outer Black-" <nl> **Yes yes, those are my titles.  Thank you Esmeralda.  Why are you interrupting my work?  I have little time left before I begin my next task.  All must be ready.** <nl> The woman floated closer, curiosity written all over her face and she couldn't keep a tone of wonder from her voice.  "We, your humble servants, are...curious my Lord.  We have noticed that you have been busy of late, especially every 7th day.  You keep to yourself in here and we wished to offer our services.  We would delight in aiding you." <nl> The figure nodded, calmly as if knowing this all along.  **You aid is appreciated if unnecessary.  Your goals are to continue to maintain the estates, protect the realm, and prepare for the next Confluence of Fire.  This matter is....personal.** <nl> Curiosity piqued, Esmeralda tried to wheedle some more.  "Personal my Lord?  Please, you know of my abilities.  I could help you.  I heard you speak of your most fiendish plan yet.  I can't help but-" The breath froze in her throat as Vel'tora turned and gave her his attention.  Her knees buckled and she fell to the floor, bowing her head in contrition.  "M-My apologies Lord!  Please forgive me!" <nl> The figure turned away and a weight lifted off of her.  **No matter.  You do not draw my ire.  In any other task I would welcome your assistance.  However this task is mine, and mine alone.  Perhaps it will be repeated for you, and you will learn in time.** <nl> Before she could speak again the air shivered, a silver bell began to ring filling the air with a quivering tinkle.  Vel'tora turned to a large mirror along one wall, a light pouring forth from reflection.  **Ahh, it is time.  I will return in several hours Esmeralda.  You are in command of the Citadel until my return.**  He gathered up the rolls of parchment and glided to the mirror.  With a touch it blazed with light causing Esmeralda to look away.  Blinking away the after images she left the chambers, daring a glance at the mirror.  *A table?* <nl> The room filled with plumes of inky purple smoke.  The walls quaked and from the smoke rose the cowled form of Vel'tora.  **I have returned to the Mortal plane!  Who dares summon me and are you prepared to pay the price?!** <nl> "Hey Vel!  We are so ready.  Been waiting all week!  We got tons of pizza and we are yours for the next 6 hours."  A grinning girl set an open box of pizza before the Shadow Lord and the 4 other young folks cheered, applauding at his arrival. <nl> A smile crossed Vel'tora's hidden face and he nodded appreciatively at the steaming pizza.  **Your offering is accepted.  Now!  When last we left your heroes...** <eos>

<sos> *Two hundred twenty five divided by 2 minus one hundred... wait. What were the order of operations again!?* <nl> Lucelle's hands slammed against the smooth table she was working on, mechanical pencil soaring off into the abyss of math related torture. Her shaking fingers found their way to her face, feeling herself burn with frustration. <nl> *Just 2 more years. Just two more years.* Lucelle took in a deep breath. All she had to do was make it through these last few years and she would be free. These thoughts were the only thing that kept her going, the only dream that forced her to get up each morning. Just two more years and she would be free. <nl> Lucelle released her breath slowly, the math assignment flapping lazily in the path of the airflow. It almost felt like it was taunting her. <nl> She frowned, eyeing her opponent between parted fingers. <nl> *You know,* she thought, lowering her hands slowly, *I can end your meaningless existence with my bare hands, you worthless hunk of tree feces.* <nl> A sudden sound drew Lucelle's eyes from her quarry. The boy a table over let out a noise that half resembled a choke and a sneeze. The tall boy threw a quick glance towards Lucelle and, after meeting her gaze, visably paled before turning back to his own assignment. <nl> Lucelle was sure it was just a coincidence, but it sure sounded like this boy just laughed at her threat towards an inanimate object. It was with a jolt that she suddenly realised that this wasn't just any boy, but Phillip Greyson. The One Hit Wonder. <nl> Lucelle's face flushed again, this time with embarrassment. Yet, why should she be embarrassed?  It's not like Phillip could actually hear her. And yet... <nl> Lucelle stared directly at the mat of dark hair that was the back of Phillip's head. Without so much as an after thought she commenced her experiment. <nl> *PHILLIP*, she screamed in her head, expectantly watching for a reaction. Nothing. Not even a flinch. She would have to try harder. <nl> *YOUR FLY IS DOWN PHILLIP*, Lucelle's gaze  seemed to pierce the back of his head as she focused all of her willpower into her assult. Not even a single glance down to check on his manhood for all of her efforts. <nl> Lucelle felt a tap on her shoulder. <nl> "Lucy!" Came a whisper in her left ear, "girl you got to hurry! Class is almost over and you're down a writing utensil!" <nl> Lucelle rolled her eyes at her curly haired friend. She had known Michelle since the 4th grade. In Lucelle's eyes, they were practically sisters. <nl> "I got it, I got it." She whispered back, glancing at the math teacher before locating her pencil on the other side of the room. It was laying on the floor beside Phillip's foot. <nl> *Great,* she thought, exhaling sharply. She didn't rise from her seat, however, and instead looked at the back of Phillip's head once more. <nl> *I know you can hear me,* she thought to herself, practically flinging each word towards Phillip's brain. *Pick up my pencil for me.* <nl> Phillip didn't move or make any indication he had heard Lucelle's demand. She smirked and tried again. *Pick up my pencil for me, please. I won't tell anyone you can hear me.* Nothing. <nl> Lucelle frowned, leaning back in her chair.  No, Phillip couldn't read minds. The world just didn't work like that. Two more years of school. Two more years of boring, usless knowledge she needed to be free. Two more years until she could leave him. Two more long, frightening years of abuse before she could move out. *That's* the way the world worked. <nl> Lucelle closed her eyes with a soft sigh. No one was going to rescue her. She was stupid to even toy with the idea of Phillip being a mind reader. After all, if he could read minds, he wouldn't be known as The One Hit Wonder. He would be able to stay with a girl for more than one date, surely, and wouldn't have misunderstood Lucelle's intentions that night... <nl> A sound caught her attention, and she opened her eyes to see Phillip's face darken as half of his pencil fell to the floor, snapped by the force of his grip. <nl> *I knew it...*, she thought triumphantly, standing quickly and making her chair scrape across the tiled floor. <nl> "I knew it!" Lucelle repeated, out loud this time. The whole class turned to stare at her, Phillip included. The dark expression had gone from his pale face and was replaced with one resembling prey about to be devoured. <nl> Lucelle stared directly into his eyes, green into blue, deep forest into unexplored ocean, and thought quietly, *I need your help.* <nl> Slowly, he nodded. <nl> (This is my first time answering a writing prompt on Reddit, and I'm also on mobile.

<sos> Asla had never travelled this far east before. She chose to hike the last stretch of her journey, leaving her beat-up car under a tarpaulin, tucked behind a copse of trees. Nature had beat back man's progress here, and all she had for company were the skittish wildlife, the rush of the waterfalls, the snowflakes cascading down belligerently. Walking rejuvenated her, but more importantly, it gave her a chance to attune her senses, probe for the Folkvarthr, the guardian of the town. <nl> She found him perched on a rocky outcrop, just a couple of miles from Seydisfjordur. Asla knew she made no noise, left barely an imprint on the fresh snow beneath her feet, but before such an experienced master, she might as well have been beating a drum, strumming a lyre. <nl> "Folkvarthr, I come in peace," she said, keeping her distance. She used the honorific so that he would know that she was cut from the same cloth, another member of the ancient clan sworn to protect their country. Underneath her shawl, she gripped her twin knives, priming her defences. It never hurt to be prudent. <nl> The older man turned then, and for a moment Asla wondered if the reports were embellished. There was a placid calmness to him, and none of the fire and brimstone she was cautioned about. His eyes, dulled with age, reminded her of the frozen orbs she sometimes had to scrape out of bowls she had left out. <nl> "I don't recall asking to be relieved," he said. "I am not yet battle-weary. I intend to guard this town until I die." <nl> "Olafur, you have done us a great service," Asla replied. "The records run with the great deeds you have accomplished. You have saved this town more times than anyone can count. You have more than earned your rest." <nl> Olafur scrounged on the ground, picked up a couple of smoothened pebbles. Asla narrowed her eyes, but this time she was over-suspicious - Olafur aimed the small missiles not at her, but at three spots away from them, one to the north and the others to the west. There was but a bleak light still illuminating the valley, so Asla relied instead on her hearing to determine where the pebbles landed. <nl> "Those are where the rifts are," said Olafur, dusting his palms off. "The monsters don't come as often now, but they still can, and they still do. They are different from the ones you deal with back in Reykjavik, or wherever the hell you came from. Nature emboldens them. They don't emerge at night, skulking in the shadows. No, these prefer the day, where they revel in being seen, being feared. There's a sadism in these parts that only I can handle, young one." <nl> There's a sadism alright, thought Asla, but instead she said, "I will be straightforward, Folkvarthr. This is not a request. The Council has asked that you retire, with immediate effect." <nl> "Oh? After all the good work I've done?" <nl> "Too good, in fact," said Asla. "Reports have come in that you no longer communicate with the town, that you have completely shut yourself off from them. The local children don't even dare come near you anymore, and they have started calling you the Boogeyman, the Reaper. Even worse, the monsters that you slay... you're not just putting them down, you're *slaughtering* them. The Council has reason to believe that you-" <nl> Olafur chose to move at that moment, streaking in a blur towards highground. Asla was ready, and so she followed closely behind, matching him step for step. She considered the possibility that he was leading her towards a trap, but pushed that thought away. She had to believe that there was humanity yet left in him. <nl> Some hundred feet above the ground, a cave opened up alongside the hill, hidden if one were only looking in from the roads. Olafur paused there, then snapped his fingers, bringing to life the candles within. Asla discerned immediately the two urns on one side of the cave, and the heaps of ash on the other. <nl> "They took my family, was that in your reports too?" Olafur asked. "I had just saved the town from another invasion, took down no less than three ghouls and two ogres on my own. They come in waves, so I thought we were safe for a while. But they were hiding, down by the waters when my daughter went to swim. My Hansa struggled with them, but she is no practitioner of glima that I am." <nl> In that moment, Asla understood why the Council had chosen her, of all the practitioners, and a tiny bit of the tension in her seeped away. She was not going to die here today, after all. "No words can convey my condolences," she said, eventually. <nl> Olafur didn't seem to hear. "And everyday, everyday I add on to the ashes of my enemies. I think, maybe, when there's enough of it, it will all make sense again, feel right again." <nl> "Has it worked?" <nl> "No," said Olafur, "not yet. And that is why I cannot stop, you see? I have to keep going. I have to keep-" <nl> Asla lashed out, her knives glinting as they sung through the air. She was not given to surprise attacks, but this was an opponent far more skilled than she was, and she would have to take what the gods of chance gave her. Heck, she had only felled the one ogre in her life, and that was quite an anemic one at that. <nl> Olafur caught her blows easily, striking at her wrists, deflecting her attacks. He stepped in, pushed his shoulder against her midriff, then lifted her legs. Asla tensed and recoiled, twisting in the air, landing on her feet. If she fell, it was over. <nl> Round and round they went, like marbles in a cone, striking and rebounding, feinting and parrying. At times it seemed that Asla, with her youth and vigor and aggression, had the edge. But Olafur would come back, a crashing fjord of implacable power, brushing her off like a weevil. Then, a slip, as Asla's foot caught on an uneven patch of ground, throwing her off just a couple of inches. <nl> Olafur seized the moment, overwhelming her with a deathgrip. Asla kept still, quivering despite her best efforts. She was at his mercy. <nl> "Why does the Council stop me?" he asked, breathing heavily. "Can a man not have his revenge?" <nl> "You are showing signs of taint, Olafur! Do you not see that? In a year, or two, will your bloodlust have calmed?" <nl> "I am *in control*!" he said. "Why do you think I have not snapped your neck?" <nl> Asla sighed, then relinquished her knives, dropping them to the ground. Olafur had not yet yielded in the face of her surrender, so there was only one course of action left. <nl> "I bring with me too another message from the Council," she said. "Straight from your master's mouth, the same one who assigned you here years ago. He bids me to remind you that you have done your part, that you deserve, at the least, some rest. 'Any of us can quell the monsters, Olafur, but only you can tend to your wounds. Let Asla carry on your work for you.' That is what he said." <nl> Asla waited, and eventually Olafur loosened his hold. She broke free, then turned to assess her opponent. The fight had deserted him, and the hunch in his back, the despair on his brows - there was no more duelling to be had. Olafur averted his gaze, but Asla caught the hint of moistness in his eyes. <nl> "She... she would be around your age, if she were still alive, you know?" Olafur said, staring off into the distance. <nl> You bastards, she thought. It's not fair sending someone who reminds him of his daughter to fight him. That's just underhanded. <nl> "I know," she said. <nl> There they sat, as the sun completed its retreat, and the stars reclaimed their fair share of the heavens. From the distance they heard the merriment from the town - preparations were underway for the winter festivals, and Asla sensed that even the monsters would have the decency to stay away this night. <nl> "Where's good for dinner?" she asked, tentatively. <nl> Olafur sighed. "I can show you, if you like." <nl> Asla smiled. <nl> --- <nl> /r/rarelyfunny <eos>

<sos> The Vytuta eat clams from the shallows, but this was not always so.  Long ago, before any Vytuta had ever clapped his hands and stomped his feet in the Dance of the Yellow Hyacinth, and before Pralih had ever etched the face of Avyta, who is the Sun, the Vytuta stayed far away from the shallows, living up high in the cloudy hills. <nl> Up high in the cloudy hills, the Vytuta slept in a cave with hard, dry stones to lay upon.  They kindled the fire, which is Avyta's kiss, from dry grasses, and filled their bowls with cool water that trickled down the hillside.  When Avyta rose at dawn, and warmed all the land with her hot breath, the Vytuta would come forth from the cave.  The noble Vytuta hunters would chase the goats into the crevasse, and hope that some would fall on the sharp rocks.  The noble hunters would cook the meat from the goats and, when there was enough, share it with all the Vytuta.  The women would make warm coverings with the goat hides, in which to first wrap the babies, and then the men and women. <nl> One day, when Avyta rose at dawn, and warmed all the land with her hot breath, the Vytuta came forth from the cave.  As they did each day, the noble hunters followed the goats by their footprints and dung.  But this day, instead of finding the goats, the hunters found a beautiful young maiden.  She had no hides for coverings, and hid her nakedness behind a spruce tree, and was shivering.  Ratem, who was the older brother, called out to her. <nl> "Maiden, tell us who you are," he demanded, "for you are not a maiden of the Vytuta, who do not show their nakedness to Ayvta." <nl> "Maiden, tell us where you have come from," Rasih, who was the younger brother, implored her, "for you are too dirty to have come from the cave, where the Vytuta wash in the cool water that trickles down the hillside." <nl> "I come from the shallows," the maiden replied, "where each day would I walk with my sister along the pebbles and sand, and we would look up at the cloudy hills.  One day, the Sea noticed me, and declared that I was to be his bride.  But I did not desire the Sea, whose water is salty, who extinguishes Avyta's kiss, and who makes the stones sharp and hard.  When I refused the Sea, he grew angry and sent a great wave.  The wave did not stop until it had carried off my all coverings and trapped my sister on a wet and dangerous rock.  The Sea declared that only when I return to him will he free my sister, and let me hide my nakedness.  Please, noble hunters of the Vytuta, return with me to the shallows, and conquer the wicked Sea, so that my sister and I may break from his curse!" <nl> The maiden then threw herself to the dirt and kissed the feet of Ratem and Rasih.  She pleaded for them to climb to the bottom of the hill and confront the sea on her behalf. <nl> Ratem and Rasih took the maiden to the cave, where the shaman slept on the hard stones.  The shaman made the poultice from the mushrooms, which are Avyta's blisters, which grow in the farthest corner of the cave.  The shaman rubbed the poultice on his chest and tongue, and stared into the Avyta's kiss, to read her omens. <nl> "The Sea is cruel," the shaman declared, "and steals away maidens, who were made by Avyta, and are sacred to her.  The noble Vytuta hunters will defeat the Sea, and they will have Avyta's blessing." <nl> The shaman then spoke of two special stones, which rested on the hillside.  These stones were shaped like the bowls from which the Vytuta drink cool water.  The hunters Ratem and Rasih were to bring these stones down the hillside, to the shallows.  Then, they were to stand back to back and ford through the Sea's terrible squalls, using the stones to protect the maiden from the waves, until she had recovered her lost sister. <nl> So Ratem and Rasih did as Avyta had ordered.  They found the peculiar stones, that were shaped like the bowls from which the Vytuta drink cool water.  They carried the stones down to the shallows, where the squalls blew strongly.  The brothers stood together, holding up the stones, and the maiden walked behind, remaining safe from the wind, and dry.  They followed the cries of the maiden's sister, and soon found her amid the surf.  The maiden reached out her hand, and pulled her sister down from the dangerous rock. <nl> The two hunters and the two maidens began to retreat from the shallows.  But the Sea saw that he was being defeated, and grew vengeful.  He redoubled the strength of his waves and wind, and soon the two hunters and two maidens were forced to huddle among the reeds.  They hid from the Sea for days, who all the while called out for the maiden, extolling her beauty.  As Avyta had sworn, the curved stones remained strong, protecting the brothers and the maidens from every gust and bellow.  At last, the Sea had no choice but to relent. <nl> The two maidens wept and thanked the brothers for rescuing them, imploring them to return at once up the hillside to the Vytuta.  But Rasih, who was the younger brother, had heard the Sea extoll the beauty of the maiden for so many days, and now loved the maiden as well.  Fearing she might choose Ratem instead, Rasih took the curved stone and pushed his brother into the mud.  Ratem hit his head on a rock, and began to slumber.  Rasih then ravished the maiden in the surf, as her sister cried and beat against his back. <nl> When Ratem at last awoke from his blow, Rasih was ravishing the maiden once more.  So Ratem lifted up the two curved stones and trapped Rasih within them.  Ratem tied up the stones with reeds and hurled them into the sea.  Alone, he ushered the maiden and her sister away from the Sea and up the hillside. <nl> Trapped within, Rasih banged against the stones again and again, calling out to Ratem, and then to the maidens, and then to Avyta herself.  But though Rasih had rescued the sister bravely, he had been no better than the Sea when he ravished her.  So Avyta cursed him to reside there forever.  She struck the stones that held Rasih with a bolt of lightning.  The stones shattered into a hundred clamshells, and Rasih became the clams within each of them. <nl> But because Rasih had helped save the maiden's sister, and because Ratem had honored Avyta in the name of the Vytuta, Avyta showed the hunters how to fish for the clams, and how to cook them.  Soon, the Vytuta would descend the hillside each day, and catch may clams in the shallows, who did not run away as the goats did.  The Vytuta would carry many bowls of clams back to the cave.  Each night, when the Vytuta would make the fire, which is Avyta's kiss, there would be enough clams to fill the bellies of every man and woman, and the Vytuta would praise Avyta for her blessing, and they would thank Ratem for honoring her. <eos>

<sos> "It's the Mesolithic period," Dr Wong spoke from the corner of the table, his eyes peering on his screen. It was just moments before when the entire team spoke to the alien delegation and the number popped up. 13,000 years ago. <nl> "Meso-what?" Liz cuts in, making her way to where Wong was seated. As a representative from the government, she could not care less about the historical or scientific details. Her job was to make sure everything goes smoothly according to what her bosses wanted. These experts were just here to support, not interfere. <nl> "Mesolithic," the professor repeated, slower this time. "It was before the first recorded instance of the human civilization." <nl> Wong pushed his chair back as the rest of the team joined Liz. They stared at humanity's timeline on the screen. It was on a slide that he usually used for his history lectures. <nl> "So... the aliens are lying then?" a tall figure blurted out. He was a professor, just like Wong, only in a different field. Part of the team hastily put together when the alien's ship magically appeared at the Paya Lebar Airbase. No radar picked it up, no eyewitness saw the ship landing. <nl> One moment there was an empty runway and the next a ship almost the size of a football field materialized out of thin air. It caught everyone off-guard. The only good thing was that the authorities were able to keep the news from spreading panic among the populace. <nl> "I don't trust them," Liz grunted as she stepped away from the table. The alien delegation made many preposterous claims. That humans were once an advanced species. Almost 13,000 years ago. They also claimed that humanity launched a starship back then, followed by several others. They were certain humanity would become a spacefaring species soon after. <nl> "But then, all we could observe was silence." The words of the alien leader still hung in Liz's head. <nl> "Should we notify the UN, or even the US, for this matter?" another voice piped out, belonging to Dr Tan, the biologist in the room. "Surely they would have better advice?" <nl> Liz sighed and shook her head. "I've already explained, we don't know how the US would react to this. Which is why we're under strict instructions not to let this leak out before we know what we're dealing with." <nl> She raised her head to see the digital clock above the room. The aliens must be wondering what was taking them so long. It was going to be a long talk, Liz suspected. She motioned to the rest of the team. "Come on, take all your notes with you. We're going back in." <nl> The team were halfway to the door when it barged open and a young officer ran in. He was panting and his uniform was drenched in sweat. <nl> "There's... there's another ship flying in! And, and command said that... that they're humans! Please-" <nl> Before the officer could finish, a bright red shot pierced through the soldier's body. The officer let out a gasp and fell unto the floor. At the end of the corridor, Liz saw the figure of the alien, with a rifle pointed at the rest of them. <nl> "It seems that discussions are no longer necessary," the alien announced before it pulled the trigger. <nl> ------------------ <nl> /r/dori_tales <eos>

<sos> *God, I miss Wi-Fi.* <nl> A rather grumpy woman, all things considered, trudged through the rain-soaked mud of something vaguely resembling 21st Century Scotland. For many weeks, she continued her long march north, fingers frozen to her quarterstaff, whole body shivering despite her thick woolen cloak, and yet she did not relent, for this woman - Fiona, as she was known best - had a quest. <nl> *And Taxis. And heating. And not going on quests.* <nl> When the Dragons had first arrived, Fiona had been shocked. Delighted, awed, more curious than she'd ever found herself, but absolutely, unequivocally, mind-bogglingly *stunned.* <nl> To Fiona, it was as if the universe had finally admitted it had always been ridiculous, and was now attempting to own it. <nl> And with the Dragons, came magic. Not immediately, but wherever the Fae Folk - as the menagerie of creatures that looked as though they'd been torn directly from storybooks had proudly dubbed themselves - went, strange things followed. It was as if their very presence awakened new rules in the universe. Wherever they went, so did the magic. <nl> It was small, to begin with. Sometimes, someone would wake up and find themselves suddenly beautiful, or young, or healthy, with no explanation as to how. Certain people became gifted with extraordinary glibness to such a degree that laws had begun being filed to prevent the misuse of such magics - really, Fiona respected their initiative - not to mention a host of other magical effects. <nl> But then things had started going wrong. In remote areas, small devices stopped working on an international level, then radio, then electricity itself, before the world had realized what was happening. Then came The Crash, and with it, The Fall of The Modern World. <nl> All over Planet Earth, like a city skyline, all the lights went out - one by one, every computer died, every lightbulb went black, every vehicle just *stopped.* <nl> People died. Lots of them. Rumours said that there were talks of bringing war to the Fae, to the Dragons, believing that The Crash was intentional on their part, but what were rumours nowadays? And really, what chance did humanity stand, if it came to that? <nl> Fiona cursed under her breath as she continued her quiet march. <nl> She wanted to break the staff in her hand in two, but she wasn't the kind to turn away an advantage when it presented itself. Fiona wasn't especially skilled with magic - not even amongst humans, who, as far as Fiona could tell, had less than no natural predisposition to the skill - but there was no downside she knew of so long as she didn't exhaust herself, and, frankly, it was her only asset right now. <nl> Well, that, her zombie apocalypse survival plan (because she'd always known it'd be useful eventually), and what she personally liked to call her logic detector. <nl> Apparently, when magic became a thing, most people decided to abandon common sense in favour of spending all day wishing they could shoot lasers from their eyes. <nl> Fiona could see the appeal in eye lasers, of course, but they were going about it all wrong. <nl> When a new, powerful, dangerous force which you know absolutely *nothing* about suddenly appears along with the beasts and people of myth, do you poke it with a stick? <nl> No. Of course not. You put on a labcoat, and gently prod it, recording how it reacts. <nl> With safety goggles. <nl> Thus far, Fiona had discovered that A) she could slightly alter the colour, temperature, texture, and, if she pushed herself slightly, material of a reasonably small object, and that B) magic was inscrutable, deliberately obtuse, and unfair. <nl> Despite all her testing, there was just no *reason* to any of it. It wasn't a mental block - simple tests with blindfolds and the like had revealed that - there was no understandable limit on the types of things she'd managed to change - she could alter most inanimate objects, certain plants (but not any other living creatures, and a few plants had stubbornly refused to change), and once, when feeling particularly frustrated, had accidentally managed to turn her hair bright pinkish-red. <nl> As it stood, Fiona was making about as good a use of her power as she could manage. She had managed to make her map glow, which, for what it's worth, did make it readable. <nl> Unfortunately, she could only maintain one effect at a time. Thus, freezing. <nl> She'd acquired the map in the ruins of Leeds. It promised a small settlement with working power - the whole thing set running by a series of hydropower turbines built in the nearby lake. Fiona wasn't sure whether that sort of thing would be simple enough to evade magic's nullification - assuming that it was all magic's fault in the first place, though she was comfortable with that educated guess - but it was her best bet, and who knows? Perhaps a large constant stream of energy immediately fed into a device that only consumes a small amount of power - say, a light bulb - might be able to sustain itself? <nl> Fiona wasn't sure, but it was worth testing, and it beat scavenging in Leeds of all places. <nl> Besides, contrary to her previous statement, Fiona really felt like poking magic with a stick right now. <nl> --- <nl> Fiona sat on a worn, blue sofa, the massed armies of lint retreating into the folds of its cushions, making way for the giant come to destroy their home. <nl> She sat clutching a large mug of tea in both hands. Teabags were a rarity nowadays, and this was amongst the last of her supply, but she felt she'd earned it. <nl> You see, in the immediate aftermath of the crash, Fiona had made a list of all the important information she'd been able to gather. It had been so sudden she didn't have much to go off of, but the list was as follows; <nl> Firstly, magic had started affecting the more remote areas first, disabling tiny devices like remote-control toys and phone chargers before anything else. <nl> Secondly, The Crash had been almost instant, worldwide. There had been no time zone advantage, as far as she knew. It was as if magic's suppressing force had simply reached breaking point, and swept across the world suddenly and without mercy. <nl> And finally, magic did seem to care about complexity. The Crash had lasted about an hour, in total, and during that time, the internet had lasted around 10 minutes with spotty connection. There had been reports on the carnage as planes fell from the sky, crushing the earth below them, and any populated road was left devastated. Throughout the entire event, however, Fiona's phone had stubbornly managed to stay active, even if it's primary use was long gone. <nl> These things put together, Fiona's pet theory - one of them, at least - had been that magic wasn't passive in location, that it was affecting certain areas first due to reasons other than total amount of technology. She thought that certain conditions must be met before it could simply 'turn off' everything, and, following that, that if it wasn't absolute, it could be fought. <nl> The right kind of simple technology, that which acted as a direct result of being fed power or, for the most part, worked independently, might be able to sustain itself. <nl> And so it was that Fiona sat with a smug grin on her face, happily drinking her tea, as she basked in the dim, yellow, glow of a lightbulb. <nl> *Today is a good day*. <nl> --- <nl> I really was not expecting the response this story got. Thank you all so much for what you've said, I was grinning like a maniac all day yesterday. I've wrote several follow-ups to this and deleted half of them, but this is the best one I've managed to write, even if it isn't as long as the first. I'll make sure to think about turning this into a book (Whether it's a novel, novella, short story, etc), and I'll PM anyone who said they were interested in the idea when and if it comes out, but until then, really, thank you so much. I'm glad you liked this. <eos>

<sos> I awoke to the doorbell. "Hrmph," I muttered, and tucked my head beneath my pillow. The doorbell rang again. <nl> Slowly, I sat up. Harvey had already gone to work, the smell of coffee lingered in the kitchen. <nl> Happy to pretend I was not home, I poured myself a cup of leftover coffee, and went to see the note that Harvey had left beside it, "Have a good day, my love," he wrote, with a small heart at the bottom. <nl> Work was long. I pulled together the books for the day, the store did not, in fact, fall apart, despite a few customers that claimed that it did. <nl> But the best part of the day, as it always was, was coming home to Harvey. He started work earlier than, so he was always home earlier than I. I came home to him sitting on the couch, watching a sitcom, with our cat Toto, perched on top of him, purring. <nl> "Hello good looking," I said to him, as I sat in the comfort of his arms, "How was your day?" <nl> That night, I awoke to sounds in the house. I sat up, and woke Harvey. <nl> "Hey," I said, "I think someone broke in." <nl> Concerned, Harvey got up, and pulled out a bat, a stereotype of a loving husband. After a few minutes he came back with a small shrug. "Must be your wild imagination." <nl> I awoke a few hours later, to static. It seemed the whole world was shaking from the aimless sounds. They reverated from the earth beneath, I swear it! And yet, Harvey slept soundly, unbothered. <nl> That morning, I began to distrust my vision. I swear from the peripheral of my vision, I saw things flit by, and I would hear noises from behind that had no foundation in being. <nl> I must be going crazy, I thought to myself. Oh, I will end up in the loony bin. <nl> In the shower, I shaved my legs smooth, and shampooed my hair. I am 32, I thought to myself. I am in great shape! If I lose it now and again, and go a little nuts, it's okay, right? <nl> As I lined my eyes, and powdered my face, I admired myself in the mirror. 32, with the face of a 19 year old. Not a line to mar my appeal. And how lucky was I, that Harvey still looked like the 24 year old that I had met many years ago. We aged well, didn't we? You couldn't even tell. <nl> "Becca, Becca, can you hear me?" The voice was clear as a bell, but it was omnipresent, I could not pinpoint where it came from. <nl> "It has been so long, Becca, I've missed you," The voice was lined with sorrow. <nl> "Hello," I called out, "Who is this?" <nl> "Your mom, oh, Becca, your heart would break." <nl> The world tipped upside down for a moment, before going back to normal. <nl> I stumbled downstairs to my coffee. Harvey left his daily note right next to it, "Can't wait to see you tonight, love dove," With a heart, of course. <nl> "Sweetheart." The voice was Harvey's. But old somehow. Quieter. Sadder. <nl> Static again. Lots of it. I put on earplugs, trying to calm my mind, but it seemed to sink into the narrowest cracks though my skull. <nl> I pulled out my phone and dialed Stephanie. She was queen of crazy. She would know what to do. <nl> "Stephie," I said, frantic, "I don't know what is going on, I just heard Harvey! He was older though, I swear. I thought I heard you too!" <nl> "Are you okay, Bec," Her concerned voice lilted through the phone. <nl> As she was speaking to me through the phone, her voice again intruded in the room. <nl> "I know it has been so long, this coma has lasted so... long, but I've missed you. The doctors say that," the voice trailed off into nothingness. <nl> "Did you hear that," I asked her, sure that the voice was loud enough to be heard. <nl> "Hear what?" <nl> Suddenly there was beeping. Steady. Unfailing. Louder, and louder. <nl> I was in a bed suddenly. It was a hospital. So many people! They all seemed so familiar. But not quite. I spotted Stephanie. She looked far older than the last I had seen her. Frightened, I said, "What's going on? Where's Harvey," <nl> Harvey came to my side. Someone was with him. She was tall, thin. Why was her hand in his? <nl> The doctor cleared the room, "She has just woken up, she must be in a state of confusion, clear out for a bit, everyone." <nl> Once alone, I asked the doctor, "I've been married to Harvey for ten years. Why is that woman holding his hand?" <nl> The doctor looked confused. "Your information says that you are single. Someone mentioned you were in a relationship before the accident. It has been eleven years dear." <nl> Eleven years. <eos>

<sos> "Are we heading in the right direction? I thought the planet was a little more towards the star?" Captain Festej asked his navigator that morning as they were fast approaching their destination, a pristine blue planet with a few swirls of brown and white on the surface. It had been nearly 10,000 years since they had last come there, but the entire crew remembered placing the primates on the planet all those years ago. <nl> "Yes, I'm sure this is the right planet. I wouldn't mistake that blue for anywhere else," Navigator Polsre responded, pulling up the itinerary the crew had had for the past decade or so on this journey. "It's the last one on our list." <nl> "Finally. I'm getting sick of this assignment. Those silly apes were never going to do much of anything. We should have really stopped the Scientific Consortium from attempting this experiment. The primates would have done just as good on Baby Blue in our solar system," Chief Scientist Quawx posited. "Polsre, what's the betting line on this planet?" <nl> "Of our crew, four say there's not going to be anything on the planet. You're the only one left, Quawx." <nl> Quawx thought about this for a moment. The Chief Scientist had taken over the project begrudgingly after the Scientific Consortium had pretty much kicked her out for transgressions in evolution. She had thought this was an ironic assignment, but the Scientific Consortium was known for their fitting punishments. Of the 99 other planets they had tried this experiment on, none had been successful. Perhaps the hundredth time would be the charm. "I'll go for them still being there," Quawx said. She was not confident bit, but she had to have some faith that the Supreme Being would want those apes to get a chance on life. <nl> "Well, we'll find out in short order," Festej noted as the ship started to come up closer to the blue marble of a planet. <nl> The crew was looking out the main viewpoint as they were orbiting the planet. It was a beautiful blue like Baby Blue, although this place looked greener than any of them had suspected. Quawx was performing an analysis of the planet for what lifeforms were existent on the ground. Communications Expert Wazret was performing similar tasks evaluating for any sounds. They had left communications beacons on the off chance the apes learned how to use them. That had not happened at any of the planets, except for a false alarm on Experiment BB042. This had led to too much paperwork, so the Scientific Consortium had just sent a larger crew on a Destroyer Ship to eliminate the planet before anything got onto the Public Feed. <nl> In looking at the results, Wazret's mouth was closed tight with her teeth clenched, shaking her head in disbelief. Beside her, Quawx was shifting her weight nervously back and forth. The results were astonishing to say the least. Wazret was hearing the squealing voices from the radio, something called "Fifth Harmony" while Quawx was visualizing what appeared to be biped animals that had become hairless. Considering they had left the planet only 10,000 years ago, there was no way that these could have evolved from other lifeforms on the planet. These had to be the primates. The Scientific Consortium would be ecstatic that this project had finally returned something successful. <nl> "Update?" Festej asked from his chair at the center with Security Specialist Blozp beside him. <nl> "There appear to be few of the original primates we placed on the planet present," Quawx began. "Instead, there are other primates that have diverged. They still have quite primitive technologies at their disposal, like this space station orbiting at a near standstill. They have taken over the land quite impressively though, living on all corners even those that are not ideal for their relatively hairless bodies." <nl> "Their communications are quite rudimentary as well. They utilize the electromagnetic spectrum for some long-range transfers of information. Wires too connect quite a number of things too. They appear to be stagnant in that regard. Fortunately, they have yet to discover the beacon." <nl> "Okay, thank you. Quawx, you and Blozp will go to the surface in disguise to evaluate on a firsthand basis the planet. You have a day to evaluate. I want regular, hourly reports though. I do not trust what is happening on this planet," Festej remarked cautiously. <nl> --- <nl> Polsre handed Quawx the winnings, three decade's worth of salary on their ship. This was a meager winning as far as she was concerned given they had been in this ship for the past seven centuries looking for these hundred planets. Now it was time for them to go back to the Scientific Consortium to destroy this planet and the atrocities that had evolved on it. <eos>

<sos> "Honey, can you please sit with us?" <nl> Surprised by the request, Marie furrowed her brow and looked over the couch. <nl> Marie responded hesitantly, "Sure, I guess?" <nl> The last time her father asked a question like this she found out her Nanna had past away. She got up slowly from the couch and realized her mother was also sitting in the kitchen. The five-meter walk felt like an eternity. Marie's mind was racing. She started to cycle through potential worst-case scenarios. <nl> *They're going to tell me papaw died. I somehow fucked up at university and have been expelled.* <nl> These thoughts continued to cycle through her head as she reached the dimly lit kitchen. She sat at the table and her heart began to pound uncontrollably. Marie started frantically scanning the room trying to get an insight into what her parents were about to tell her. The stained yellow wall paper behind her parents started to make her sicker than normal. The yellow contrast with the dark cabinets always reminded Marie of a 70's horror film. <nl> Her parents remained silent. <nl> After the agonizing stillness, her father said, "Marie. I am not sure how to break this news, so I am just going to come out and say it. Your mother and I made a mistake. We were under the impression that we allocated your skill points per what we shared with you when you were thirteen. <nl> Apparently, there was a mix up at the agency, and none of your points have been allocated." <nl> Marie's sun-kissed skin when pale. Her entire facial structure lost integrity and an empty stare replaced her once concerned look. <nl> "Let me get this straight. There was a 'mistake' and none of my skill points have been allocated." <nl> "Yes, that is correct." <nl> "Then how am I a functional human being? I am in the top 1/3 of my class. I have a high propensity for the sciences and have been accepted into graduate school. I am going to NYU next fall. <nl> The allocation was pretty straight forward to me. <nl> 18/30 <nl> Intelligence > Science > Mathematics <nl> 10/30 <nl> Physical development > Athleticism> Muscular structure <nl> 2/30 <nl> Sociability > empathy and compassion." <nl> Her father closed his eyes and let out a deep sigh. He continued, "Yes, I know what we thought you were assigned. It seems as though that never happened." <nl> "So, I have managed to get where I am today with zero allocation of any skill points?" <nl> "Well, yes." <nl> Marie's expression transformed instantly. A small grin started to emerge. <nl> "I have all these skill points that I can still allocate? I have a clean slate that I can fill as I choose?" <nl> "Well, technically, we need to do the allocation for you. But, yes, we can choose how your skill points are distributed. This has never happened, so they are unsure of how this will affect you." <nl> Marie's roller coaster of emotions started to become grounded once again. She had trouble comprehending the numerous potential consequences to this revelation. She looked up at her parents and could tell they were concerned. <nl> Marie looked down at the table and began to reflect on this crazy evening. <nl> *Fools. They are going to regret ever screwing this up. I'll present a plan that seems mutually agreed upon. With my current intelligence, if I can add just 20 points, I can rule this world.* <nl> Marie looked up with a disarming smile and said, "Mom. Dad. Its ok. I am not upset. Like you said, this is unfortunate, but we can sit down to formulate the best way to allocate my points." <nl> Her parents looked immediately relieved. <nl> Marie's mother finally joined the conversation, "We are so glad to hear you say that. Now we can make our little princess even lovelier." <nl> Marie smiled back, but the lack of empathy in her eyes caused a shiver to run down her father's neck. <nl> ###Part 2 in the comments### <eos>

<sos> "You know, Jenna, it is common in times of deep distress to confabulate - to replace the actual reality with one that is more palatable to the mind. And I understand why it would be comforting to think of yourself as sane --" <nl> "-- I am sane! That's what I'm trying  --" <nl> I frowned, absently scratching my wrist. "-- but nonetheless, it is *important*, a necessary step, for you to *accept* the truth. Otherwise, you can't move on to the next step...the healing. And that's why we're here. To heal you." <nl> Jenna stared at me, her body quivering with repressed emotion. <nl> "Doctor Anderson, I --" <nl> "-- Doctor Anderson was my father, Jenna. Please, call me Ben." <nl> "*Ben*, I just want you to think...what if our situations were reversed? What would you do? Every part of my being is sure - it *knows* - that I do not belong here. I had my own office, for Christ's sake!" <nl> I feel my lips pull back into a taut smile. "Now, Jenna. You're getting agitated. Let's take a deep breath for a moment. Normally, it's not healthy for us to let our patients perseverate on delusions but I am guessing that it will calm you down if you feel like you have gotten to tell 'your story,'" I paused to wiggle my index and middle fingers up and down in the air, "and that reminding you that it is just that - your *story* - might not be helpful at this moment. So let's make a compromise. I will listen to you, let you try to convince me. I promise that I will take it upon myself to follow-up on information you give me. But you need to do something in exchange. Your previous doctor wrote up a comprehensive treatment plan, and from all accounts, you have been fighting it tooth and nail --" <nl> Jenna leapt out of the plastic chair, her slippered feet landing on the dirty tile of the floor. "-- which is *exactly* what someone who --" <nl> The smile left my face. I cleared my throat and watched her silently. I saw the hospital gown move with her body as she inhaled deeply. Jenna's pale blue eyes focused on the floor as she slowly sat back down. <nl> My lips pulled back again as I watched her. "From what I read in your file, restraining yourself is a major step forward for you, Jenna. I congratulate you." <nl> Jenna mumbled something that I assumed was "thank you." I paused to see if she was going to continue her interruption, but she remained silent. <nl> I gave a light chuckle. "*As* I was saying...we will need to work out an agreement. I do something for you, you do something for me." <nl> This time, her inhalation was accompanied by a full-body shudder, as if her petite, athletic frame was trying as hard as her brain to adjust to the idea. <nl> "Good!" I felt genuine happiness to see that I was already making progress with her - the first happiness I had felt in quite some time. I had, of course, been extremely nervous coming in this morning, unsure what to expect of the new situation. I certainly had not imagined that things would be going this well when the day began. <nl> I pushed back up the sleeves of my white coat, making a mental note that I should exchange it for one that fit me better. I opened my notebook and gave my pen a jaunty click, then turned my attention back to her, studying her. "Please - go ahead." <nl> Jenna gave a brief nod, a lock of chestnut hair coming down in front of her face before her trembling hand tucked it back behind her ear. "I'll do my best to remain objective and give you verifiable information. I've been working as a behavioral aide here for three weeks. I live at 542 Spring St., Apt 204, with my boyfriend Dan. I also see my twin sister, Mara, about once or twice a week. You can call her at 973-619-6464. I imagine they've destroyed or hidden my file but you can also check with the payroll company about the fact that I have direct deposit set up." <nl> I made some notes in my notebook, then looked up at her. "Social?" <nl> Jenna's head tilted to one side. "Hmm?" <nl> I studied the topography of her face, the coquettish folds of her ear. "Your social. Or the last 4, anyway. I doubt I'll get very far without it." <nl> I loved seeing how joy sparked in her eyes at that. Those eyes. "Oh! Of course! 5820. Doctor An - *Ben*, thank you so much. You don't know..." The tremor that had entered her voice began spreading through her whole body. She made no attempt to wipe away her tears when she looked up at me. I imagined they were snails sliding down her pale cheeks, searching for a dark hole in which to hide. <nl> "Don't mention it. But I'm afraid we have to leave it there for today - I can't go getting behind on my first day!" I laughed - laughed like I haven't in quite some time. "But first...!" <nl> I held up a Dixie cup with a rainbow assortment of pills in it and gave it a little shake. "I can tell you with confidence that these drugs all have a relatively short half-life, so if I discover your story is true --" <nl> "-- *when* --" she corrected. <nl> "-- it will be easy enough to wean you off them." <nl> Her delicate fingers, trembling, reached for the cup. I studied her fingers as I felt her skin brush mine briefly. I thought of bird bones. Songbirds. Tiny, fragile - must be careful not to break them. <nl> Satisfied that she had taken her medicine, I gave her what I imagined was a professional nod, then walked out of the room. I marveled at how different it felt to walk on the floor while wearing shoes. <nl> I got to what they told me had been her office when I arrived. I still could not believe the day I was having. Transferred from Weehawken that morning, and then, during processing - to be told...to realize! <nl> Her previous "doctor" had been an imbecile, of course. A tapeworm. Squish. That was the sound his brains had made. <nl> I opened my notebook, placed it on *her* desk, taking a moment to simply savor the irony of it all. Then I reviewed my notes: <nl> * 542 Spring St. Apt. 204. Kill Dan. <nl> * 973-619-6464. Mara. **Must** meet her. <nl> * Social 5820. Bank??? <nl> I frowned down at the page. Stealing her money hardly seemed worth the time when there was so much more I could play with. I could think about it for later, I suppose. <nl> I wrote something at the top of the page before I closed the notebook: <nl> *Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules* <nl> *Passions, desires, and fears, is more a king.* <nl> I leaned back in her chair. I could smell her - her essence, intermingled with the fabric. <nl> Sheer, exultant joy. What a day. And many, many more to come. <eos>

<sos> Call it a rush. Meeting new people. Appraising them. The catalogue of my mind is full from charming first dates, and it's ever growing fuller. I can't cram just anyone in there <nl> But this one seems worth it. <nl> This evening's date--Thalia, 33, originally from Norway, now here on my side of the world by some careful working of fate--met me at Aux Trois Capitaines. Good setting. She's charmed, I'm charming. Instant spark. <nl> We hit it off, instantly. <nl> I've been doing this a while. I have met many people. For me, the gender matters less than the person: who they are, what they have done. But she is one of the most interesting. <nl> Her hobby is mountain climbing. She is a polyglot dabbling in nearly ten languages. In school she studied organic chemistry, a skill whose usefulness I can't think of now, but it is rare in such a pleasant person. She has seen <nl> The champagne bubbles like the blood in my brain. I watch her smooth pale arms move and wonder at seeing the Balkans through her eyes. Or how the world looked from the top of Kilimanjaro as she stood there, gasping and humbled by the vastness of the world. <nl> I love her. I crave her. <nl> That's the best part. The exhilarating part. It is what brings me back to some bar or restaurant somewhere, anywhere, over and over again. As long as I can feel that spark. That forward tug of compulsion that cries, *I need you and your everything.* <nl> I offer to walk her to the train station. She seems relieved, tipsy and delighted. We walk holding hands. She is wobbly in her heels. <nl> I draw her down an alley, promising a shortcut. The look she gives me is halting, hesitant. <nl> "C'mon," I say. "I grew up here. I know what I'm doing it." <nl> That or the alcohol in her brain convinces her. She follows me into the dim, giggling stupidly about muggers in America. <nl> My belly rises in delight. I can hear nothing beyond my own blood roaring in my ears. <nl> Call it a rush. In that final second you can hear the both of us, our thoughts and selves inextricably wound together thenceforth. Your life changed, irreversibly, and become mine. <nl> I reach for her face as if to kiss her. When she relents to me I grab her by her skull and slam her head into the wall. She makes a stunned sparrow cry and looks at me in horror. <nl> Just before she dies, I think how lovely her fear looks. She realizes with animal panic that she doesn't want to die. <nl> And then I open her skull against the stone. She slumps bonelessly down, leaving behind a splatter of blond hair and brain like spaghetti on the brick wall. <nl> It was unbefitting, to ruin someone as lovely as her. But I just couldn't wait another moment to get her inside of me. <nl> "*Farvel og takk*," I say. Goodbye, and thank you. <eos>

<sos> Jessica crumpled the note in her hand. The all-too-familiar tremble returned to her spine, spreading down her arms, raising the tiny hairs in its wake. <nl> >This could have been us. <nl> The phrase echoed through her mind. Over the years, she had grown used to the squiggly handwriting and the cooked meals. She never ate them or slept in the made bed. The first few times, she'd called the cops, which of course did nothing. <nl> 'No evidence of foul play, ma'am,' the officer had said, 'but we'll keep a car in the area.' <nl> Jessica reached for the knife, still on the cutting board sprinkled with chives residue, still warm in her cold hand. He was here. She tried listening for sounds, but all she heard was the drumroll of her heart. <nl> Slowly, she made her way over to her bag and fished out her phone. She had done this a hundred times before. <nl> "He's here," Jessica breathed into the phone. <nl> *** <nl> "Hey, what do you make of this one?" Sam said, waving the newspaper. "A woman claiming to have been stalked for thirteen years was found dead in her bed last night." <nl> His gray hair bounced off his shoulders as he made it over to the couch. His brother stared disinterestedly at the TV screen. Years of cheeseburger and beer abuse had taken its toll on Dean's body, and his stained wife beater struggled to contain his bloated belly. <nl> "That does have a certain air of *I-don't-give-two-shits* to it," Dean grumbled. "Besides, we're too old for this, Sammy." <nl> "But imagine being stalked for thirteen years," Sam said, adjusting his glasses. "That's worse than-" <nl> "Worse than what? Going to Hell? Making buddies with Lucifer? Getting smacked around by a bunch of monster-under-your-bed types for a career?" Dean's face turned red as he spoke. "We're retired now. Let someone else handle it." <nl> "Nobody did for thirteen years. Everyone probably thought she was crazy. Imagine living like that..." <nl> Dean mumbled something unintelligible and turned up the volume on the TV. Sam shook his head and limped toward the door. He knew now why his brother never watched the news or read the paper - something strange was bound to come up eventually. <nl> His cane tapped against the marble stairs. It wasn't his responsibility, and the woman was already dead. But for some reason, this bothered him. He had to get to the bottom of it. <nl> *** <nl> Dana Scully glanced suspiciously at the tall elderly fellow limping up to the reception desk. She pushed her walker forward, feeling the cramps bite into her legs and back. Usually, she didn't put her nose in other people's business, but the pressed suit and wavy silver hair didn't sit right with her - men of his age usually wore sweatpants and plaid vests, and were bald. <nl> "Excuse me," she said, her voice creaking. "Who are you?" <nl> "I'm special agent Booth with the FBI." The man leaned heavily on his cane, squinting his eyes. <nl> "No, you're not," Dana said curtly. "You're almost my age, and I don't remember anyone like you there." <nl> "Ah, you got me. I'm Sam Winchester, PI." <nl> "Let me guess; you're here about Jessica Lawrence. I'm Dana Scully, actually with the FBI... well, until I retired, at least." <nl> Sam looked her up and down, the wrinkles on his forehead growing deeper and darker. "It's weird, though, isn't it?" <nl> "What's weird, exactly?" <nl> "That this woman didn't get help for thirteen years, and never managed to identify her stalker. This is going to sound strange and possibly incriminating, but I feel guilty." <nl> Dana nodded. She felt exactly the same. That's why she abandoned her beloved flower garden and took the train down here. She had even called Fox, but his dementia was starting to get the best of him these days. <nl> "I get the feeling you've worked on cases like this before?" Dana finally said. <nl> "I have a few under my belt." Sam chuckled, and then started coughing. "Sorry, yeah, but it's been a while." <nl> She wasn't exactly sure why, but there was something in this man's eyes that was inherently good. The urgency in his voice told her that he wanted to put this right - as right as it could be. And once again, she felt the same way. <nl> "Okay, let's see if we can get into the morgue somehow." Dana turned her walker around. <nl> Sam nodded, and a smile cracked his chapped lips. "I think I have an idea." <eos>

<sos> The woman comes to the Wal-mart, alone, on a windy evening.  The door to the box-store separates for her automatically when it senses her human movements, and she shivers in the vestibule.  She is very tired, but still she smiles and nods when Albert the greeter says hello, grinning with his strange teeth.  She pulls a shopping cart free, and goes shuffling down the aisles, each full of every commodity imaginable, all stacked atop each other like the towers of some cliffside gothic castle. <nl> She only has twenty dollars cash remaining in her coat pocket.  It was given to her by Sandra from the community center, who had just that afternoon also invited the woman to live in her house, now that her mother had at last kicked her out for good.  Whether the money was a loan or gift is still not altogether clear to the woman.  However, the distinction does not matter.  Deep down she knows she does not intend to ever repay it. <nl> "My spare room isn't much bigger than a closet, but this is to help you make it feel like it's yours," Sandra had announced, when she pressed the crumpled bills into the woman's hand, "Get yourself a new little dresser, some sheets, and whatever else it will take.  I'll help you set it up tonight after work." <nl> Sandra's kindness had initially measured over two hundred dollars.  Alongside the spare room, it was all such a gesture that the woman quickly realized she had no concept of how to respond, so she just stuttered a thank you, and then hugged her savior for over five seconds.  She told Sandra that she had already become a second mother to her, who, unlike her real mom, understood addiction, and how when people stumble, they need compassion and support, rather than an eviction, and an oath to no longer enable. The woman promised not to waste the opportunity Sandra had given her.  But even though she believed at the time that she had meant what she promised, before she was even a mile from the community center, she found herself detouring on her way to the Wal-mart, over to the park where the men in the puffy jackets are always sitting on the same bench.  Soon enough, almost all Sandra's money was gone.  And now, meandering through the endless Wal-mart aisles, stuffed full everything a human being could ever covet, the woman encounters the sheets and the small dressers, and the prices on them.  She begins to cry. <nl> "Are you alright, miss?" Albert the greeter asks, mincing toward her.  He is very old and his skin is quite pale, even under the fluorescent Wal-mart lights.  Usually the woman would lie to a stranger and send him along after being asked this sort of question.  But, with Albert, for some reason she does want to dismiss him so summarily.  Perhaps it is the lilt in the frail man's voice or perhaps it is just the frantic desperation of her situation; regardless, the woman feels compelled to tell him an intimate truth. <nl> "I think I just ruined the last chance I had at a decent life," she says, wiping her nose on her sleeve, "All because I can't control myself.  All because I'm a fucking vampire who just can't stop consuming and hurting people." <nl> She goes on to unburden herself to Albert, as if he was a priest, with the kitchenware aisle for his confessional.  She tells him about the drugs, how it began with the cooks and other waitresses all reeking of garlic after too-long shifts in the restaurant, how it migrated to parties on the weekends, and then to alleyways and abandoned buildings, how her mother would inspect her forearms with a flashlight and lock up her purse at night, how she went to the meetings, but spent most of it on her cell phone, until it was her turn to speak, when she would stand before the crowd and just lie.  She tells Albert about Sandra, and how she doesn't even know what she is doing in the fucking Wal-mart since she has no money left and will never again be able to look that saintly woman in the eyes. <nl> "Well, if you're a vampire, then I'd say you're in the right place," Albert tells the woman, stroking her back gently, "Everyone in Wal-mart is a vampire in one way or another, just insatiably consuming all this garbage.  But, you know, maybe being a vampire is the highest, best thing anyone can be these days.  So maybe you should just stop fighting against what you really are." <nl> The woman chuckles a little.  The old man is more pragmatic than she would have expected. "That's all well and good, but it won't exactly help me find a place to sleep tonight, now will it?" she asks. <nl> "Oh I don't know about that," Albert responds, "I think if you really wanted to, you could still find a way to lay your head at that Sandra lady's place, and I think you could do it without having to ever admit your little slip up to her.  Tell me, do you think Sandra has a welcome mat outside her house?  If not, this Wal-mart's got a lovely selection of welcome mats, and plenty of them are cheaper than twenty bucks.  Maybe all it will take for you to get yourself into Sandra's house tonight is laying down a welcome mat beside her door." <nl> The woman looks at Albert with a furrowed brow.  "Okay now you're not making any sense, what does a welcome mat have to -" <nl> Albert puts his wrinkled, liver spotted finger on her lips.  He leans in and whispers in her ear.  Her eyes go wide. <eos>

<sos> as we sat there, some already glazed over from their heroin class earlier, the teacher was going over the correct way of injecting with a syringe. Mary Jane was bored out of her mind. *why does every class feel the need to go over the basics, I got it after the first three classes went over the same thing* Mary was just glad she'd had her daily smoke of marijuana before class otherwise she would be getting antsy by now. <nl> "psst" <nl> Mary turned towards the sound to see Pythagoras leaning over from his seat and pulled this weird looking box with a screen and buttons on it from the inside of his jacket. <nl> "what is that?" <nl> "it's a calculator, hey, Do you wanna try some math?" <nl> "what's math?" <nl> "it's really neat, you calculate numbers and equations and stuff like that. My dad taught me." <nl> Mary Jane was trying to figure out what he was talking about when the meth teacher Mr. Heisenberg noticed the calculator. He stopped what he was doing and practically zoomed to Pythagoras' side. <nl> "what are you doing with that?!" he whispered in a panic "don't you know what the government will do if they find out you know how to do mathematics?!" <nl> Just then a shrill sound started coming from the camera in the corner and school security was in the room almost instantly. They grabbed Pythagoras making sure that the calculator was out of sight from the rest of the class before dragging him out the door. <nl> Mr. Heisenberg turned to the class and said "I'll be right back, in the meanwhile practice what I taught you." and he left the room following after the guards. <nl> As Mary pulled out the practice syringe she thought to herself *I hope he's not going to be in too much trouble, he was kinda cute* <eos>

<sos> Germea stared at Immeta, his eyes wide.  "That's ... that's..." his voice trailed off. He frowned, then leaned sideways, to call out down one of the quarters corridors leading off the crew's mess. <nl> "JOHNSON! HEY! JOHNSON!" <nl> Johnson, the crew's only human, poked her head into view from her bunk, where she had been ensconced with an electronic reader.  "Someone call?" <nl> "Is it true that humans used to put themselves in metal boxes and launch themselves off... "he foundered for a moment, clearly forgetting the name of the planet in question, before rallying. "Off your planet with liquid fuel cannisters?" <nl> Johnson frowned, her small dark human nose wrinkling. "What do you mean, *used* to?" <nl> It took Immeta a moment to process that.  "You mean they still do it?" he asked, horror dawning. <nl> "Some people. Most of us use grav engines like the rest, but one of my old neighbours was in the Vintage Rocket Ship Society.  And that's not even getting into the weirdos that still fly the old sub atmospheric craft...." she stopped for a moment, snapping her fingers in an odd way that Immeta had learned signalled that she was trying to remember something. " Airplanes. Yeah, some people are crazy enough to still drive those combustible fuel craft through our ATMOSPHERE." <nl> There was a collective gasp.  By then, most of the crew in the mess were listening in. <nl> "Have you tried it?" Germea asked curiously. <nl> Johnson snorted. "Hell no. Why do you think I signed up on the first trade ship that would take me? I'm not sticking around for that nonsense." <nl> edit: forgot an important word. <eos>

<sos> Then Tim went to the bakery, followed annoyingly by Tess. The little bell above the door gave a soft tingle to announce his arrival. The baker and his wife looked up and smiled a hello. Tim politely read his list of required baked goods. While the baker gathered the required ingredients, his wife and Tim had a riveting conversation about the price of wheat in relation to the season. <nl> Unfortunately, this session of pleasantries was cut short by Tess' irksome cries to get to cover. Tess had selfishly tagged along with Tim on his errands, risking his safety and sanity. Her flamboyant hair was surpassed in gaudiness only by her personality. With no regard for the damage being done to the humble bakers' livelihood, Tess haphazardly threw magic orbs at the rogue spirits who killed her family (a morbid story she told everyone she came in contact with). <nl> Tim, sensibly, hid behind the counter with the bakers, attempting to reassure them during such a frightening, yet easily avoidable, situation. He even spared Tess, however undeserving, from blame. With an incredibly pompous flourish, Tess banished the last of the spirits back to their realm. Tess unapologetically walked over to where the three innocent bystanders she had just placed in harms way were seeking refuge. <nl> Tim, attempting to placate Tess's massive savior complex, thanked her for her help (even though she had caused the problem). The bakers even played along, most likely scared to death by such an abomination of nature. Tim, ever the gentleman, thanked the couple and volunteered to help them fix the damaged property first thing in the morning. He even invited Tess to the dinner for whom the now unobtainable breads were intended. <nl> Tess unfortunately accepted. <eos>

<sos> It was big diesel-guzzling take-no-prisoners beast of a vehicle. Amphibious, bullet-proof, noisy as an earthquake and converted from some leftover war materiel that was so hot that with five spare minutes and some film you could take x-rays. Had plenty of space in the back for the things he needed to carry. Up front, plenty of room for a jolly old elf who rattled around in his old red suits; everything that had happened left him feeling so upset that the pounds practically fell off. He called it SLEIGH II. <nl> The radiation didn't matter to him, but it did a number on his reindeer so they were holed up for the duration. Missing Christmas 2037 was bad enough: there had been a NORAD radar on him for real and his old sleigh took a point-blank hit from a 35 kiloton anti-ballistic interceptor. He had to think quickly in those few milliseconds so he spent his magic on making sure he and his faithful reindeer survived the explosion and the fall down, down, down, towards a land full of bright and terrible lights with a thousand deadly Christmas stars overhead showing the way to Hell. <nl> He had had that old sleigh for ... forever, really. Same for his famous red toy sack. Watching them flash out of existence was heartbreaking. But it gave him something in common with the humans. He lost nearly everything, they lost everything. The only ones that were left were locked down in their shelters, pockets of dozens here and there dug into the sides of mountains and into old mines. There wasn't anyone left watching the sky. Instead they watched Geiger counters and clocks and calendars, marking off a century a day at a time. <nl> So why fly? There wasn't anyone around he was trying to hide from. Green military pants, red shirt, black boots, and Mrs. Claus made some green suspenders. He wore a tight fitting cap with his old white fur puffball stitched right to the top, instead of flopping around like the old days. Leather gloves kept his hands comfortable on the wheel of SLEIGH II and he made his way overland. <nl> * * * <nl> Tucked away in their beds were the dozen or so families of *Community Shelter 8.* The air had its characteristic twang, the smell of the filters and that weird burned smell that came through from the outside feed pipe. A construction paper christmas tree flapped against the wall in the common room, caught in the draft of the air recycler. <nl> Christmas Eve! A whole year since they went down into their hole and they had celebrated survival in their meager way. <nl> Christmas would mark a year since the world above went silent. Everyone planned on sleeping in, and there were no formal activities planned. It used to be a birthday, Christmas, celebrating hope and family. Now it was a death-day. <nl> The paper Christmas tree breezed this way, went still, and then breezed that way. <nl> If anyone was looking, they would have seen a man by the U-pipes that fed the life support system fresh air and ejected the shelter's stale air. They would have seen him reach into his pocket and throw a handful of shiny dust into the air, and they would have seen him climb into a huge armored vehicle and wink away at an impossible speed towards the northwest, in fact towards the *Oak Creek Village Fallout Shelter.* <nl> * * * <nl> Rebecca and Jian had the early shift this morning. No one else was up. <nl> Rebecca poured herself coffee from the pot in the common room, as usual. She hadn't run into Jian yet, but he would be in the control room checking the outside instruments, routine stuff. <nl> The movement of the paper on the wall caught her eye. She sighed. She was thankful that life in the shelter was boring, mostly free of drama. She had played a game as a kid built around the life she was living now - things could be so much worse. <nl> But what kind of future would her children have? Everyone decided that there wouldn't be gifts, just some extra rations with the menu heavy on the sweets. Had to keep things fair, the shelter had the things they *needed* and didn't make provision for something as frivolous as Christmas gifts. <nl> A package. About as big as a filter module. Wrapped in beautiful paper and tied with a silver and green bow, and a tag tied to the knot. It hadn't been there during the celebration the night before. <nl> Had someone been holding on to this for a whole year? She smiled as she went over to pick it up, and it was a little heavy for its size. She wanted to show it to Jian, so she made her way to the control room. <nl> "Knock knock," she said. "You're not going to believe it." <nl> "You know?" Jian asked. <nl> "About the present?" <nl> "What?" Jian was busier on the instruments that he usually was. <nl> "Hold on," Rebecca set the gift down, "what are you talking about?" <nl> "Look, look through the periscope." <nl> Rebecca looked. It was snowing outside. It made her stomach sick. The last time she saw snow, it was made of ash, of buildings and things and animals and people. A whole year. *A whole year*, she thought, *and someone pressed the button again.* <nl> "God, no..." she whispered. "How hot is it?" she asked Jian. <nl> "It's not." <nl> Rebecca's eyes went to the geiger counter. And it read: <nl> **000** <nl> "The meter's broken," she reasoned. <nl> "It's not," Jian replied. "I just finished double-checking with the test source. Meter works. That's real snow and there's no radiation outside." They sat together quiet for a few seconds. "You were saying something when you came in," Jian said. <nl> Rebecca looked at the present, wrapped up and pretty. "I was going to ask you if you knew where that came from." <nl> Jian looked confused. "What's going *on*?" He pointed at the tag. "What's the tag say?" <nl> FROM: SANTA <nl> TO: COMMUNITY SHELTER 8 <nl> MERRY CHRISTMAS - 2038 <nl> "I'm going to open it." Rebecca's fingers sunk into the paper tearing it, before Jian could suggest something else. <nl> It was a simple cardboard box underneath, and the lid slid neatly off. <nl> Corn seeds. Wheat seeds. Peas. Pepper seeds. Apple and cherry seeds. Avocado pits. A few whole potatoes. There were more and more. <nl> And a note: *For New Life* <nl> * * * <nl> I collect my stories at /r/wpforme <eos>

<sos> Flavia removed her helmet and threw it into her armor rack, sending the pristine ceremonial garb tumbling into the dirt, before collapsing into her chair. She was seething with rage, the sound of constant rainfall grating and infuriating. If only that fucking bastard had just- <nl> "Primus," The flaps of her holotent opened slightly to reveal a legionary from outside of her cohort, "The Equestrian requests your presence in the command tent." He paused and looked at her nervously "Presently." <nl> Flavia picked up a jug of wine and sent it flying in his direction, prompting his expedient removal from her general vicinity. Tightly gripping the bridge of her nose in a futile effort to calm down, she sighed heavily. Of course Cassia wanted to see her, that bitch never shirked away from an opportunity to criticise her betters. She would relish the opportunity to place the blame at Flavia's feet for this, of that she was certain. <nl> Ignoring her helmet she threw open the flaps of her holotent prompting an aquilan salute from any nearby legionaries. She left them to their dice games in the mud without so much as a glance, electro sandals propelling her past the remainder of her cohort and sent her storming into the command tent. <nl> "You piece of shit," She growled before the soundproof flaps had even closed behind her, gripping the equestrian by the cape strap. "What happened to our god damn air support, we were sitting ducks out there." <nl> Cassia just smiled back smugly, making no effort to wriggle out of her grip. "How has the role of Primus been treating you Flavia? It must be tough, filling shoes as large as mine," She scoffed "Especially with operations like this one on your resume." <nl> "You little-" She raised her hand to strike her before she was interrupted. <nl> "Enough!" A loud voice echoed through the large tent, stopping her dead in her tracks. "This useless squabble has no place within these walls." <nl> "Legatus?" Flavia asked breathlessly, before swiftly releasing Cassia and turning to give him a proper aquilan salute. "Forgive me Legatus, had I been made aware of your presence I-" <nl> "You would have dropped this charade and spoken your mind freely?" He said, looking up at her from the ever-changing battle map laid out on the table. "Then I implore you to keep my presence in mind until further notice." <nl> She opened her mouth to speak but quickly thought better of it, as even Cassia stood in silent salute. "Understood, Legatus." <nl> Legion Legate Marius was not the most people prone commander she had ever served under, but his tactical brilliance was undeniable. He had put the 262nd legion on the map, and under his command, it had known many storied triumphs. Today, however, was not one of them. <nl> "The Air support," he grumbled at them, eyes fixed on the previous battle playing out in front of him. "They were relieved of my command not but 5 hours ago." <nl> They stood in shock, waiting for an explanation that never came. Eventually, Flavia caved. <nl> "Legatus, with respect," She started <nl> "Imperial Legate Septima Dominica has demanded additional support for her campaign on Varinia IV," He scratched the back of his head, "Hence the loss of the bulk of our atmospheric strike craft and troop delivery vehicles." <nl> "So we are to abandon the planet then?" Cassia asked, at which point he looked up to stare at her sternly. "Legatus?" <nl> "No, we are to proceed with the offensive until further notice," <nl> "But without-" Cassia protested <nl> He slammed his fists into the battle map hard. "Without them, we are still the 262nd legion of the Emperor!" His teeth ground together tightly as he shouted. "And the 262nd legion does not know defeat!" <nl> He stared them down until they both gave him a nod which allowed him to slip deflated back into his seat. "I want a new approach strategy by sun-up," He sighed heavily "Dismissed." <nl> As they left the holotent, Cassia made sure they were far enough away before she exploded. <nl> "That mad bastard is gonna kill us all," She looked pale even as she fumed "Without vehicles we won't last a week camped out into the open like this, let alone manage an assault on the perimiter." <nl> Flavia hated it when the equestrian was right, but she couldn't deny the truth in her words. They had both seen it in him, that mad hunger for victory which had ultimately consigned them to a fate of inevitable death and ruin. <nl> "We have to do something," Cassia muttered, "We could poison his wine or something, convince the laticlavius that this plan is utter madness." <nl> "We'd risk martyring him," Flavia bit away at her nails as her mind worked overtime. "Plus, it would be an act of high treason if anyone found out." <nl> Cassia scoffed "Rather that than a slow and agonizing death," <nl> "It may not come down to either," She smiled as she turned to face Cassia. "Can we secure enough supplies for a cohort to last up to two weeks in the mountain passes." <nl> She thought about it for a second. "How quickly?" <nl> "Ideally tomorrow." <nl> She pulled out a holobook and scratched down a few calculations. "In theory, yes, but-" <nl> "Perfect, I'll ready my men for the trek and we'll reconvene at sun-up." She smirked as she slapped Cassia on the shoulder. "Bring your hiking cape." <nl> "Wait, I'm coming with?" <nl> Flavia shrugged. "You can take your chances with the palisade, but I wouldn't bet on it still standing by the time we come back." <nl> "Fine," She answered grimly "But what the hell do we tell the Legatus." <nl> Flavia smiled back. "The truth," She patted the vibrosword at her side. "That we're gonna go kill some aliens." <eos>

<sos> The protocol was simple enough for even the least educated slave to understand. They were to wait for the master of ceremonies to declare that dinner had commenced, and for the accompanying music to play, before they strode into the great hall of the *Ignitus*. A hundred dishes, balanced on the palms of a hundred slaves, a meal fit for the gods. <nl> Except that when it came time for them to exit, Aeliana remained in her place, no more than twenty paces away from Justus, first son of the great House Marcellus. She ignored her fellow slaves who tugged at her sleeves, and instead shooed them away. They scattered, nervously tugging at the collars around their throats. <nl> "Master Justus," she said. But those of House Mercellus didn't hear her - they were too absorbed in the events beyond the plexiglass panels, those invisible barriers which separated them from the cold embrace of space. In the distance, tiny stars burned and flared in rapid succession. <nl> "Master Justus," she repeated, more firmly this time. "I bring urgent news. Master!" <nl> "Hmm? Aeliana, not now, please," said Justus. "There is a time and place for everything. We've travelled this far out to watch this phenomena with our own eyes, so whatever it is you're complaining about this time, it can wait. I promise, I will listen to you later-" <nl> "No, Master, you need to hear this now. This *very instant*." <nl> Her tone was more than enough for the guards nearby to rouse from their lethargy. They gripped their shock-lances and thrummed them to life. Other slaves had paid the price for far less insubordination, but even they knew that Aeliana was a favourite here, and so they waited on their master's response. Far easier to follow a cue than to strike their own path. <nl> "I said, later. Now is not the time." Justus was a fair man, more patient than most, but a shadow of displeasure had manifested in a scowl on his face. "Do not try my patience, Aeliana." <nl> Aeliana shrugged, then flung the dish she had brought in against the far side of the great hall. The fine ceramics shattered against the plexiglass, and as pickled pork knuckles slid down, Justus, and his brothers and sisters, leapt to their feet. <nl> "How dare you! Have you gone mad!" Justus held his bracelet up high, then said, "Are you spoiling for a beating, Aeliana? A simple press of this button, and I don't care how well-trained you are, you will have no choice but to *submit*!" <nl> "We have walked into a trap, master. If we do not respond now, all is lost." <nl> She noted, with a measure of satisfaction, the confusion which settled over them like cobwebs - too fine to grasp, too unnatural to ignore. <nl> "There's no such thing as a 'chain-link of star explosions'. That's a lie. House Marcellus was lured out here to this unmanned sector of space for a reason." <nl> "Watch your tongue, Aeliana! Remember your place! I was given good intel that this once-in-a-lifetime occurrence was-" <nl> "What those are, *master*, are warp-drive destination beacons. Your enemies are moving in on your this very second, and you don't even know it." <nl> "Nonsense, again! Even if that were true, the *Ignitus* has three guard starships in close range! We are hardly at any risk here." <nl> Aeliana sighed. "This is a classic Drusan tactic, master. Where I come here, we like to divide our enemies, jam their communications, then pick them off one by one. And if our enemies choose to serve themselves up to us, spend their time gawking at fireworks instead of getting ready for war... well, then, so be it. But before you go any further to chastise me, please, just try linking up with the other ships." <nl> The smile on her face only grew wider as she watched Justus, then his brothers and sisters, all take turns on their personal communicators. She waited until every single face had turned white before she continued. <nl> "You still have time, I can still help," she said, as she pointed in the direction of the plexiglass again. "By my estimates, the enemy ships will still need about... ten minutes to get in range. If we can get-" <nl> "Tell my guards what they need to know," said Justus. "I'll have the commander here, you can tell him what they need to do." <nl> "No, I won't do that," said Aeliana. She tapped her collar, then smiled. "Are you really going to have us argue about chain of command when there's a battle around the corner. No. Set me free. I will lead them for you." <nl> They would have argued further - it was in both their natures. But it was also at that moment that the alarms sounded. It was not a sharp, abrasive alarm. Instead, it was a low-toned, roiling alarm, one which brought to mind deep-sea whales going about their mating calls. It reverberated through the hall, grinding against their bones. <nl> "Master Justus," said Aeliana. "Not much time left. Set me free, and I promise you, I will have the enemy pushed back within the hour. Either that, or we can all perish here." <nl> Justus sighed, then tapped the unlock sequence into his bracelet. Then, when it failed to register, he tapped it in again, faster this time. Still, where there was supposed to be a confirmatory *beep* to signal that he had released Aeliana's restraints, there was no response at all. <nl> "Strange," Justus said. "It can't seem to detect that you..." <nl> Aeliana reached behind her neck, then unclasped her collar. It came off with a pop, and she dropped it with a resounding bang. <nl> "I had already deactivated it myself," she said. "I just wanted to see if you would place your trust in me. And since you evidently have, though with some prodding, I'll see that you're not disappointed." <nl> She walked over to the nearest guard, then wrested his shock-lance away from him. She drove it hard into the ground, and its tip lit up in an electric fire. The glow against her face only served to underscore the bloodthirst in her. <nl> "I'll show you what a Drusan warrior can do, Justus. Then, perhaps, you can re-evaluate whether you really did manage to enslave my people, or whether we entered your service for a reason." <nl> --- <nl> /r/rarelyfunny <eos>

<sos> "Okay Jessie, so who did you want to be today?" <nl> The little girl looked down at her feet. "I'unno. I just wanna... I just wanna walk again. And hug my brother." <nl> "Well, I can give you telekinesis- you could move your own body that way. Or I could make you an exoskeleton." I gulped. It was usually easier with the kids who wanted something outlandish. The ones who just wanted to do something normal were a lot harder, making someone /just/ telekinetic enough to move their own body was a lot more difficult than outright giving them the general power. It needed to be highly refined, accounting for weight and the feeling of moving ones own body. <nl> Somehow, it was a lot more satisfying, too. <nl> "Tele-tele, whatever. I won't need a big heavy machine, right?" <nl> "Nope," I replied. "But you'll need a little practice." <nl> "I'd like that." <nl> "Okay. You're going to need to sit on that thing in the corner so I can weigh and measure you, okay? The nurses will give you a hand." <nl> I planned my camera and got to work. Weight calibrations. She'd be able to walk by the sheer force of will, which she had in spades. <nl> If the girl survived treatment she'd need to come back pretty often for a power adjustment. Sadly, if someone was sent to me, that usually meant it was a last wish. You had to be very far gone to even be allows it or... <nl> Well, most people died from prolonged exposure, I mused, running the subroutine that was the former shred of my humanity. <nl> It was still better than the alternative. <eos>

<sos> As Tutrig awoke, <nl> He first thought it a joke, <nl> That the night before was so clear. <nl> But with a cold creeping sweat, <nl> He did recollect, <nl> How the Dwarves had rung in New Year. <nl> Satmoc Minebane, <nl> Had drunk all the champagne, <nl> And went streaking down through the hall. <nl> Yolack thought it a lass, <nl> Complimented that ass, <nl> But got more than he bargained for. <nl> As for Sanmolda, <nl> She lowered her shoulders, <nl> As she watched her husband be kissed. <nl> Although a mistake, <nl> His trousers did quake, <nl> Satmoc had stolen her bliss. <nl> With swift resolution, <nl> She found a solution, <nl> As she sharpened the blade of her axe. <nl> First she did trim, <nl> But her hair was still grim, <nl> So for the first time, a dwarf did wax. <nl> When Yolack saw her, <nl> He said 'wife I adore ya, <nl> I forgot 'bout the goods under there.' <nl> But Sanmolda did scolder, <nl> Shoved him up by a boulder, <nl> Said 'I'm more than what's under my hair!' <nl> 'Lover forgive me, <nl> I know I'm no Gimli, <nl> I'm begging you please take me back.' <nl> 'Only if you do the same... <nl> If you can handle the pain, <nl> Of waxing each crevis and crack.' <nl> Tutrig remembered, <nl> The tears that descended, <nl> The face of a man full of fear. <nl> He reached for a bottle, <nl> His memory he'd throttle, <nl> Of another damned Dwarven New Year. <eos>

<sos> "Explain to me again how it works?" <nl> We're in bed. It's warm. Heavy down. The ceiling fan *clap-clap-claps*. <nl> Angie rubs my chest. Stares up at the fan. <nl> "They...well, I guess they sort of *shoot* electricity into your brain," she says. "Not a lot. A little. Then you have like a seizure. Then it's over." <nl> "Sounds awful," I say. "How's it help?" <nl> "Kinda resets your brain, I think." She's making that face. Pursed lips. Half-closed eyes. The *Worry Has Turned to Anger* face. "It's probably a scam. Just torture. Just taking my money." <nl> "But Dr. Tenneson..." <nl> "Yeah. She thinks it'll help." <nl> The hand is still on my chest. "Are you mad at me for making you go?" <nl> She doesn't answer. She probably is, but doesn't want to say. "You can't make me do anything. I went because I went." <nl> "I thought it'd just be talking," I say. "I thought that's what therapy is. Just talking. Maybe some drugs." <nl> "It's that," she says, nodding. "And sometimes, when *that* doesn't work, it's things like ECT. Nobody knows." She sighs. "Nobody knows. It's all guessing." <nl> "Did talking make you feel better at all?" <nl> She gets up off the bed. "Not any better than talking to you." <nl> "I'm not a therapist." <nl> "You're a good listener." <nl> "Well....yeah." <nl> "Talking helps. It helps me understand things. But I need a little more than understanding." She finds one of the many framed pictures in the room, picking it up, looking at the image, then setting it back down - face down - on her dresser. All the pictures are like that. Face down. She doesn't like seeing the faces of her friends and family until she wants to see the faces. She doesn't like them watching her. <nl> "How many times?" <nl> She looks at me. "How many times do I have to shoot electricity into my brain? Dunno. Maybe 10 maybe 50. It causes memory problems. Looking forward to that..." <nl> "Oh. But that's not..." <nl> "It's like changing the wiring in my brain," she says. "It'll help...it'll just help. Or it won't." <nl> "Then it's worth trying." <nl> She nods, then moves to the door. "Okay. I gotta go. Mom's taking me. You be good. You're in charge while I'm gone." <nl> "I'm always good," I say. "Good luck." <nl> She smirks, opens the doors, then leaves. I'm alone. The ceiling fan *clap-clap-claps*. I can't move. I can only wait. I can only watch the ceiling fan. I can only wonder who she'll be when she comes back. If anything will change. <nl> I couldn't do anything that day in her first room, the pink and white one, with unicorns and a towering dollhouse in the corner. I could only sit on her pillow, there in the dark, on the day after Christmas, as her uncle crept into the room and whispered things into her ear, things I couldn't hear. Eventually I fell on the floor. Eventually I was knocked under the bed. I think that's why she still talks to me. Why she doesn't mind me looking at her. Because I wasn't looking at her then. Like the framed pictures were. And the posters were. And the dolls were. <nl> This is our fourth bedroom. Things change. Things stay the same. I've sat on so many pillows and watched her lose herself. Watched her hurt herself. Watched her wrap braided blankets around her throat and look desperately for some place to hang the other end. <nl> All I've ever been able to do is talk to her. Or, I suppose, mostly just listen. <nl> Somewhere far, far away, I feel something like a tingle. Like I've come out of the dryer and I'm crackling all over. The feeling lasts less than a minute, but at the end I can no longer hear the ceiling fan. I can no longer see the bedroom door. <nl> I'm still here. Still me. But all that is is just a dusty, gray bear. Flattened. Patchy. <nl> There's nothing to hear and there's nothing to see. There's nothing to say. <nl> I can't say anything at all. <nl> Then I remember that really, I never could, could I? <nl> Everything is dark. <nl> At least I still remember Angie. <nl> That's more than enough for an old bear like me. <eos>

<sos> "OK now" muttered Nevermore "this is getting ridiculous". He stared at his adversary, Phoenix. <nl> His opponent noticed him staring, instead of summoning dark flocks of crows. "What is it, too scared to fight?" She raised an eyebrow. <nl> Nevermore sputtered, "No, I am just apalled at the direction the league of heros has apparently taken". He called his powers now, ravenous shadows emerging from his finely tailored cloak. "Why on earth does your suit have a boob window now? What even is the point of the suit?! You might as well be wearing a t-shirt!" <nl> Wings of fire radiated from Phoenix's shoulders, flapping once and scorching the air around her. "Hey now, I think it looks alright, and besides, suits are for the public in my case, not for protection." <nl> His shadows coalesced into something larger, its ghastly call echoing off the scyscrapers of New London. "And why is it skin tight?! I've seen porn, nay, MOST PORN has less fetishized gear. What happened to the classy gold armor? Or that one red dress?" <nl> Phoenix let her fire cloak her, but kept shouting, embarassed "That dress wasn't even a suit! And what if this is more comfortable? <nl> "And why is your phoenix dive now shaped like a naked women!?!?!" He was ignoring her now "Instead of a PHOENIX? The league has you changing your TECHNIQUES? They might as well call you "Naked Fire Women" now! This is just, this is unconscionable, I respect you too much for this to stand, I am going to have a word with Myst, this is ridic"-his words were cut off as the flaming giant rammed in to him. <nl> ---- <nl> "Soooooo, how was Nevermore" Aura said slyly. <nl> Phoenix huffed "he got away". <nl> "Now, you know that's not what I'm asking about" <nl> "FINE, he hated it, ok?" She groaned, "I was just trying to be more appealing you know?" <nl> Aura nodded sagely, "Told you. Maybe you should, I don't know, actually try flirting like a normal person?" <nl> "I have literally no experience dating ok!?" Phoenix grumbled "he did say he respected me! Maybe we should try a new suit, you know, the gold armor one." <nl> "That's what I told you to stick with! We know windows are out, but you could be a bit more subtle about it! Want it to have armor-boobs this time?" <nl> ".... maybe". <eos>

<sos> The crash and boom from the front of the bank echoed throughout the whole building.  Audiophage sat up with a scowl. <nl> "The hell's goin' on out there?"  He roared at his minions.  They scurried away, having the presence of mind to know that the boss was not in a good mood.  He didn't like disturbances, and that sounded like a disturbance. <nl> Phage just shook his head, turning back to the locked vault he was at work on.  Breaking into banks was not at all his style, but he didn't get to choose where the folks with the tech kept their goods.  He'd been at this game a long, *long* time, as the grey lacing his hair proved.  Sometimes, you just had to adapt. <nl> The sound of footsteps brought him up short. <nl> "What was it?"  He hissed, craning his head around, and then stopped. <nl> The sight before him was not his sweaty, black-jacketed thugs for hire.  She loomed over him, six feet of taut, gently muscled woman topped with a mane of strawberry blonde hair. <nl> "Not what you were expecting?"  She purred, flicking a finger idly.  A little ball of fire swirled at the tip with every twitch. <nl> Phage stared, eyes narrowed.  He'd been in the business a long time.  The fashion trends of heroes had always been a moving target - ranging from the universally unappealing unitard designs of the earliest Gifted to the more risque adopted by the 'forward thinking' women heros of the last decade.  He was well used to seeing more of a hero than he ever really *wanted* to. <nl> But this... <nl> "Isn't that uncomfortable?"  He blurted out, eyeing her incredulously.  The way the fabric was cut out in strategic areas, leaving skin exposed...the high cut around the sides...It *had* to be riding up.  There was no way she *wasn't* pulling spandex out of her ass every three minutes.  She blinked, competely taken aback. <nl> "Excuse me?"  She said slowly, the words ominously drawn out.  The little fireball circling her finger wasn't so little anymore.  He'd really rather not be burned to cinders in the little room.  Phage turned back to the vault, just so that he wouldn't have to look at her.  He was *not* blushing, he told himself. <nl> He could end this.  He could put a stop to this, right now.  She just reeked of green inexperience.  But, he knew his own powers, and, well.  If he stepped in, with her like *that*, there was only one way this was going to end. <nl> He couldn't quite bring himself to go there.  Not yet. <nl> "You thought you were so clever, eh, Audiophage?"  The woman drawled, slowly circling around him.  His head swiveled around stubbornly, facing the other way no matter how she wandered.  "You didn't *really* think you could just waltz in here and take it, did you?" <nl> Audiophage ground his teeth together in frustration.  It was like she was reading the script to some horrible, cheesy cartoon. <nl> "This your first week?"  He managed.  The pacing stopped. <nl> "That's not relevant, is it?  Hands where I can see them, *Phage*.  Nice and high." <nl> He glanced up.  She was standing right in front of him.  The fabric - what little there was of it - was drawn tight, like the slightest nudge would send her spinning free.  He gulped.  She was young enough to be his *daughter*, damnit.  This was *not* in the job description. <nl> "I'd rather not, if that's all right with you."  He muttered, spreading his hands out to either side.  She clicked her tongue, resuming her walk.  Her high stilletos groaned in complaint. <nl> "Whatever.  Police will be here soon anyway." <nl> "Just thought you seemed new.  That's tough, I feel you.  It's...hard for new Gifted to get their costumes tailored in time." He started, eyes still downturned.  The thought of her continuing like this just didn't sit right with him.  If she wasn't going to let him talk head-on, then he'd come at it from the side. <nl> "Oh, that wasn't a problem."  The hero said, laughing under her breath.  "I know my way around a sewing machine." <nl> "Made it yourself, did you?"  He said weakly. <nl> "I like to stand on my own, when I can.  You about done?" <nl> "Oh, I'm just musin'.  Don't mind an old man."  Audiophage said quickly, plastering an innocent grin onto his face.  "Only, the Enhancement from the shops are *pretty useful*."  He tried to make his tone as convincing as possible.  "I'd hate for you to get hurt by somethin' you weren't expectin'." <nl> The proper tailoring shops would *also* never, ever allow their heros to walk around in something like *that*.  She was going to catch a cold, even if she didn't get taken out by a villain looking at her the wrong way. <nl> Distantly, he could hear the sound of sirens, and swore softly.  The hero chuckled, her voice low and soft. <nl> "Almost time, isn't it?  Keep those hands out, now.  No tricks." <nl> "No tricks."  He said, still with that dumb grin on his face.  She was an idiot.  A well-meaning idiot, but he couldn't stand around and let her get herself hurt right at the start of his career. <nl> And so when she lapped him again, making one last round of the little back room, he threw his amplifiers into overdrive. <nl> The hero shrieked, throwing her arms up reflexively as the vibrations shook the air.  Audiophage had one last instant to confirm that yes, in fact, the laws of physics were still functioning, and then he slammed his eyes shut. <nl> Pushing his way past the woman, he made for the door.  He was going to be cutting things *close*.  His men were screwed, but that was their own damn fault.  It wasn't worth his skin to save them. <nl> One last glance over his shoulder showed the girl sitting in a quivering, trembling heap, grabbing at the scraps of cloth that used to be her uniform.  All of the clever bits of glue she'd used to hold herself in had given up in the face of simple resonant vibrations, all of the teensy straps holding artistically cut sections snapped by tension. <nl> The police were going to get a *show* when they came to arrest their villain, he thought.  The thought didn't make him happy, although he *was* a little satisfied with himself regardless.  He'd done a good deed that day.  And they said all villains were evil. <nl> He could manage one more, while he was at it. <nl> "There's a great little costuming shop, down by that hero mechanic's garage.  South District.  Ask for Taylor."  He said, pausing at the doorway.  "Tell her Phage sent you, and she might even....ah...squeeze you in." <nl> Before she could say a word, rapidly turning incandescent from rage or humiliation, he fled, unable to contain his grin. <nl> (/r/inorai, critiques always welcome!) <eos>

<sos> From beneath the comforting fabric of her black robe, Nocturne sighed. This had to be her third museum heist this year already, and it's not like there were that many museums to pick from. At this rate, she'd have to start stealing from the Musical Instrument Museum or the History of Dairy Museum soon. <nl> Still: the display of Incan Relics at the Museum of Indigenous Peoples was worth the risk of repeating oneself. As a bonus, the artifacts were valuable enough that people would assume she was stealing them just to re-sell them, never guessing her *true* purpose. <nl> Nocturne adjusted her burnished metal eye-mask, scanning the room carefully. After she was done here, she could do some banks, maybe try a government building to shake things up. She was getting to a point where she had her legacy to think about, after all. <nl> Nocturne approached the first display case and carefully rolled down one of her elbow-length gloves, sliding it off and folding the black silk in her hand. She delicately placed a carefully manicured finger on the glass and waited as obsidian waves emanated from the point of contact. She felt the resistance give way as the surface changed to dark ether, then casually reached in and grabbed the ceremonial headdress waiting within. <nl> Her cloak rustled as she turned on the heel of one of her knee-length boots, moving on to the next relic. Just as she was about to lay her hand on the case, she froze. <nl> Garish fluorescent lights began flashing around the walls of the room. A rich, baritone voice behind her commanded, "Stop right there, evil-doer! You have been caught red-handed by Lieutenant Kernel." <nl> Nocturne groaned. "That is, hands down, the *worst* name I've ever heard," she called out, still not moving, "and keep in mind that I've faced off against *Fry Guy* and someone who called himself *Montezuma's Revenge*." <nl> "Divulging your evil plan will not help save you from my technological might, villain! You are about to get a one-way ticket to Justice Town!" <nl> At this, Nocturne turned around, a fiery retort on her lips. Whatever she was about to say, though, ended up coming out as a quiet "What in the actual f--" <nl> Standing before her, arms akimbo, legs shoulder length apart, was...she actually wasn't quite sure what she was looking at, because the colored lights she had noticed earlier were sweeping across her vision. <nl> "Listen, would you mind...turning those off? I think you're going to give me epilepsy if I look at you much longer." <nl> Lieutenant Kernel frowned, then brought a forearm to chest level and touched some buttons on a small control panel there. The lights turned off. "It's cyan, magenta, yel --" <nl> "I don't care. At all" Nocturne interjected. <nl> There was an awkward pause as her eyes adjusted to the dim lighting in the museum. The hero broke the silence: "I wield the power of a *computer*! Now, I will use my technology to turn on the lights - without using a switch!" <nl> Nocturne shook her head. "Look, kid, let me give you some -- holy hell what is *that*?" <nl> Lieutenant Kernel had turned 90 degrees, aiming his wrist control at  the wall, and then paused. "What is what?" <nl> Nocturne had not noticed in the low light before, but now that the hero was in profile... <nl> "Are you - you can't...is that a *codpiece*!?" <nl> The hero looked downward, then back at his foe. "I don't...think so. What's a codpiece?" <nl> All that was visible of Nocturne's face beneath her hood was her mouth, and it was currently contorted in horror. "You...that's *you*? Good God! Get...get...some compression shorts, or a...a cup, or...duct tape? Something. *Anything*." <nl> "Ha ha ha! Your attempts to distract me will not work!" He clicked a button and light flooded the room. Nocturne screamed. <nl> "Ahh! It's even worse! Where is the rest of it? Why are you...did you shave your *abdomen* but not your *legs*? And...are those...are those *nipples*?" <nl> Lieutenant Kernel shifted awkwardly as he looked down again. He had a molded breastplate that left his midriff bare, like some sort of medieval sports bra. The lights were mounted on the shoulders. Below the waist, he was wearing tight - extremely tight - shorts, and they were definitely short. He looked like a basketball player from the early 80's. For reasons that Nocturne could not fathom, there was nothing from his mid-thigh to his lower calf, leaving his hairy legs exposed. <nl> "What?" he frowned. "I made it myself!" <nl> Nocturne's lips were now closed tight, the corners of her mouth twitching. "You...don't say." She looked him over again, cocking her head to one side. "Oh...oh, honey, no. What's on your head?" <nl> "It's a fedora. Why?" <nl> Nocturne's body was shaking with barely repressed laughter now. "But...what's on top of your...fedora?" <nl> "It's the energy pack! I couldn't figure out how to strap it on myself without it burning me. See?" <nl> He turned around and showed his bare lower back, which was marred by an ugly, rectangular welt. <nl> It was too much. Nocturne threw her head back and the empty museum rooms echoed with the sounds of her cackles. Lieutenant Kernel's eyes were wide as he stared down at the floor. "I need to power my unit somehow," he said quietly. <nl> "Your UNIT!" Nocturne shrieked, tears running freely down her face. "To be honest, I think your *unit* has plenty of power already! Oh...oh...I think I peed myself a little. Your unit!" She continued laughing, dabbing at her eyes with the glove she had removed earlier. "Okay, kid, I...I can't take this anymore. I'll go with you if you promise to never go out in public dressed like this ever again." <nl> She had mostly recovered but every now and then something would set her off and she would lapse into a burst of giggles. The hero gave a somber nod, his face tight, and escorted Nocturne out of the building. <nl> * * * <nl> /r/ShadowsofClouds <eos>

<sos> It was always difficult, adapting to a new body. It was probably the most challenging aspect of covert reconnaissance missions. <nl> Issues like understanding the local language and culture, those were merely a matter of information absorption and enough simulation time. <nl> Adapting to a new body, however, a new biology, that was different. <nl> It always surprised people, when she told them. Because the remarkable similarity of sapient organic life across the galaxy was a known fact, something every schoolchild knew and accepted. <nl> It seemed there were only so many successful body plans. Most aquatic races shared common body shapes. And similarly, most land dwellers were bilaterally symmetrical bipeds. <nl> There were indisputable advantages to the usual packages of features. Opposable thumbs for tool use, walking upright for energy-efficient - if unstable - locomotion, warm-blooded biology for better temperature control. <nl> But still, adapting to a new body always bothered her. <nl> That was difficult for many of her friends and family to understand. They didn't quite comprehend when she explained the issue. <nl> Certainly, there were issues such as the different proportions of arms and legs, the specific posture and stance demanded by bone structure. But those were matters that knowledge implants and automated reflex systems were designed to deal with. <nl> Intellectually, there shouldn't have been any difficulty. <nl> And in practical terms, there wasn't any problem. In practical terms, she could function. The implanted knowledge, the recorded skills, these addressed the functional challenges. <nl> The many subsystems installed in her new body handled issues like balance, or precision in delicate physical movement. There was, for example, no need to learn how to walk in the new body. That was all handled for her. <nl> It was the mental portion that was the disruptive aspect. Getting used to it on an emotional level. Living inside a new skin. Breathing in the scents of an alien atmosphere. Feeling comfortable with a strange face. <nl> That was the challenge, on a purely visceral level. <nl> She was good at her job, though. <nl> It took a particular kind of personality to willingly spend entire stellar cycles encased in alien flesh, living among people of a different species. <nl> It took a particular kind of personality to embrace their way of life, to pass as one of them, undetected. <nl> Or, at least, mostly undetected. <nl> She knew her emulation wasn't perfect. Many of the humans she'd met and interacted with at length likely considered her somewhat... atypical. <nl> She'd corrected many of her early errors, but even now, even today, there were occasional mistakes. <nl> It was fortunate, then, that the inhabitants of this planet were high enough on the civilisational scale - at least in social terms - that any of her oddities were largely accepted by the natives. <nl> They would not judge, at least not overtly. <nl> And, more importantly, they would not suspect. <nl> However, she still endeavoured to correct any mistakes. <nl> Some were her fault. Because even a highly-programmed and experienced field researcher like herself... couldn't be perfect. Not quite. <nl> Some mistakes, however, were due to lack of information. There was always some nuance, some detail, some reference or area of local knowledge that the preliminary studies had overlooked. <nl> That was why she was here. Standing outside the transparent barrier of non-crystalline amorphous solid - the glass, the locals called it. Watching. Observing. <nl> It had been a simple conversation. She had thought so, anyway, until it had suddenly veered into unfamiliar territory, leaving her scrambling to cover her inadequate local knowledge. <nl> Like many sapient beings in the galaxy, humans were fairly body-conscious. That sort of vanity, that sort of focus on the aesthetics and well-being of the physical form... it was not completely universal, but it was a common trait. <nl> She'd been very pleased, when she'd discovered how much of the local electronic public-access information networks were dedicated to pornography in all its myriad forms. An observer could learn a lot about a civilisation from watching their pornography. <nl> But what they'd missed was the fact that, to put it simply, body-modification technology was in its relative infancy on this planet. <nl> They had some degree of cosmetic surgical augmentation. Some degree of performance-enhancing biotechnology. Yet it was all remarkably primitive by interstellar standards, compared to the relative sophistication of their other sciences. <nl> For a civilisation at this overall technical and social level of development, she would have expected more. <nl> She'd become aware of that gap, when discussing a device a coworker had acquired. <nl> They had been standing in the communal rest area at their workplace, at the place of employment she'd inserted herself into, as part of her local identity. <nl> Her human coworker had shown off a new wrist device, apparently a commercial electronic product used to track and record a human's physical movement. <nl> Her coworker had then asked about her own exercise routine. <nl> She'd deflected the question. She was, of course, aware of the concept, and she knew humans practiced it. But she had no actual need to do it herself, considering that much of her own body was synthetic, simply designed to mimic a human body. <nl> The small proportion of it that was biological, actual human-compatible flesh, was maintained in optimum condition by her mechanical systems. <nl> The encounter had made her aware that her appearance, her size, her muscle tone, her general standard of health, and other physical factors... would naturally lead most humans to assume that she did perform exercise regularly. They would assume she was familiar with their places of exercise, the facilities known as gymnasiums, or gyms. <nl> She did not know much about these places, save for scattered references in the entertainment media she had reviewed. That cursory knowledge had been enough to navigate the conversation to a satisfactory conclusion. <nl> But she resolved to address this gap in her knowledge. <nl> That had led her to this location, a gym that her human coworker had recommended when she'd claimed to be 'between routines'. <nl> Her colleague had added that, aside from its comprehensive inventory of machines designed to assist humans in the practice of exercise, the gym was also a 'studio' that offered instructional courses in a variety of disciplines, all exercise-related activities. <nl> Her colleague had believed she would be interested. <nl> She was now observing one of these classes, through the glass. <nl> At first she had been confused. Two humans had appeared to be engaging in combat. But there was no hostility, no sense of threat. And, very unsettlingly, the other humans were quietly observing, but making no move to stop the combatants. <nl> Then the two had separated, made a respectful gesture to each other, before turning to the other gathered humans. <nl> The group had then repeated the movements shown to them by the instructors. And they were instructors - she'd realised that, belatedly. It made sense in context. This was, of course, a training facility. <nl> She looked at the group, and the building around her. She considered this data point. <nl> The humans learned physical skills. They had to. There was, clearly, more to operating their bodies than the... purely instinctive. <nl> And they did not have, she realised, any means of installing these lessons. No significant body modifications meant no knowledge implants. <nl> She looked at the class. The movements were... sophisticated, she realised. Easily the rival of any of the standard recorded patterns in her own library, used for the disabling and restraint of hostile humanoid sapients. <nl> Some of the movements, she realised, were unknown to her. Not recorded in her database. Perhaps that was merely because she was a researcher, not a combat specialist, but she had a sudden suspicion... <nl> She'd been observing the humans for a while. They were an interesting species, but she hadn't seen any sign of... genius. No sign of anything special, no sign of any area in which they were extraordinary by galactic standards. <nl> But this... <nl> "Kinesthetics," she said out loud. <nl> "What's that, miss?" <nl> She half-turned, glancing at the human behind the reception counter, the one meant to receive arrivals to the facility. <nl> "Sorry," she said, commanding herself to laugh, in feigned mild embarassment. She had a subroutine for that, and it was now practiced habit to trigger the appropriate systems. She also activated the custom movement she'd programmed in, which lifted her hand to rub the back of her neck. "Just talking to myself." <nl> "No worries," the receptionist said. "You like the class?" <nl> "Oh, uh, yeah," she replied, "it's awesome. Super cool. But, it's just, I was just thinking, I can't see myself doing something like that." <nl> "You look like you work out, though," the human observed, sounding curious. <nl> She glanced down at her body. "Well, I guess? But that's not what I meant. I'm a klutz. No coordination, yeah? I couldn't do all that, uh, Kung Fu shit." <nl> The receptionist smiled.  "Hey, don't sell yourself short. We've got a range of self-defence courses for all skill levels. There's a free introductory thing on Saturdays, for beginners. You could come, see if you like it. No pressure. No harm trying, right?" <nl> "I," she said, slowly, thinking it over. "I guess? Uh, I mean, sure?" <nl> "Great, great, I've got a flyer here, or you can check out the times on our website..." <nl> *** <nl> [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7pvelr/wp_to_most_of_the_galaxy_turning_your_body_into_a/dsm6lvy/) <eos>

<sos> Clarise Fae was the closest the living could get to being a ghost. She glided through the town at night in long gowns going nowhere except for oblivion. Her face and shoulders were deathly pale and her hair was a startling silver that just barely touched the ground. When she appeared, people avoided her, they would cross the street to avoid being on the same side of the road as her, whisper when she was out of earshot, mothers scared their children with tales of Clarise Fae, and the bards sang tales of the tragic beauty of the last of the Fae, the cursed line. Her tale was second only to the stories of the Hole. The one at the edge of town with no end, the one that scared away many and attracted even more. <nl> Of course, the tale Clarise Fae is a story about the Hole. For every night, she would wander the town, but in the end she would stand at the edge of the Hole, peering down into nothing, trying to find answers when there were none. Answers for the past. <nl> Clarise had been one of seven daughters. They all had her silvery hair, the pale skin, the eyes that seemed to hold a storm behind them. Her sisters were playful, even joyous. Her parents were well respected in the town - they ran a shop selling charms guarding against the spirits that came out of the hole. Often a Fae sister or two would be around and about in the shop helping out their parents, and playing jokes on the customers. They were often hard to tell apart, but Clarise stood out, even then. She never smiled, never, never joked. Just obediently fetched whatever her parents asked her to from the shelves. Still, the girls were the town's little angels - beloved by all, so few risked having children here by the Hole. <nl> So everyone in the town was heartbroken when one of them jumped in the Hole. The carpenter had sworn he had seen one of the Fae sisters walking about in the night and head towards the hole, almost in a trance, and of her own volition, jump in. <nl> It was a tragedy, and the whole town wept for the little life that had been winked out. <nl> "Just the nature of the Hole," the old muttered shaking their heads, "some children just can't resist." <nl> It was a tragedy, but nothing unheard of. Nothing unheard of. The Hole was the Hole. Slowly but surely, the town moved on, and so did the family, or as much as it was possible to move on. <nl> Apparently one of them had never quite gotten over it. Soon after, another sister was seen jumping into the Hole in the dead of night. <nl> Again, the town wept. <nl> "Children take it hard, a death, you know," the elders said. "The two sisters had always been closer than the rest." <nl> But it was also around this time that the first whispers started, that one child lost to the hole is understandable, but two? From the same family? <nl> And just as everyone had stopped reeling in shock, another Fae jumped in, once more in the dead of night. <nl> This time the elders muttered and shook their heads. Some people stopped going to the shop, but most spat at them and comforted the Fae instead. "To lose children is bad enough, but to be scorned for it is even worse," they said. <nl> They stopped going when the fourth and fifth sisters jumped together. <nl> Soon after, the town saw Mother, Father, and final sister walk to the Hole hand in hand. Nobody tried to stop them, either out of fear or out of sympathy. <nl> And the life of the town was gone, just like that, taken from the hole. <nl> Or, well, not all of it. <nl> Clarise Fae remained, the lone sister, the quiet one, the one most would have thought would be the first to jump. Yet she lived, in a sense. She never talked to anyone, getting food and water from the woods. A potter said he once saw her snap the neck of a squirrel in the woods and bring it home to eat. When Clarise first walked towards the hole, the town thought it was the end of the Fae. The final sister would jump and put an end to the curse. <nl> But she didn't. <nl> She only stood, half of her feet off the edge, but she never did jump. <nl> On one such night the Carpenter's boy - a young man of about nineteen, around the same age as Clarise. He was a fool, lured in by beauty, the long hair, the sad eyes. He Followed her in to the woods on one such trek into the hole. <nl> Clarise glided out of the woods early morning, but the boy never did. <nl> Enough was enough. The townsfolk had let her stay despite the Hole's Curse, but now she was a danger to others. "Better to be rid of her," the townsfolk reasoned. "Lest the Hole take us all." <nl> And so they gathered behind her at night when she stood at the edge of the hole. Despite the hundred or so townsfolk behind her with torches, Clarise didn't even bother turning around. It was like she didn't hear them, that there was nothing for her except the Hole. <nl> The townsfolk stood for a moment, doing nothing. They had expected fear, pleading, but not this, not ignorance. Eventually one of them, the Carpenter, took initiative. He stepped forward, calmly and coolly, and placed a hand on Clarise's back, and without a moment's hesitation, shoved. <nl> The Townsfolk gasped, they had wanted to drive her out, not to give her to the Hole. Not even murderers deserved that fate. <nl> But it was not Clarise who fell. She whirled to the right just as the carpenter shoved, and the carpenter found himself off balance from the shove. His screams echoed through the forest as he fell into the Hole. <nl> Clarise shook her head at the spot the carpenter had been, her eyes sad. And for the first time, she spoke. "You have come here trying to get rid of me, to drive me out, to kill me. I have tried to do the same for years now, to jump into this damn hole-" <nl> Without warning another townsfolk charged her, pitchfork raised to impale her. She could have moved, but she stood there, as if accepting her fate. The Hole rumbled. <nl> And then what appeared to be a root of a Tree appeared from the Hole, grabbed the charging man by the waist and dragged him into the Hole in a fraction of a second. <nl> Again, Clarise barely reacted, just stood with those sad eyes. "It wants me, see, all to itself, it is very jealous, very protective," she said. She hook her head, and a ghost of a smile touched her lips. <nl> "The Hole is in love with me." <nl> No one stopped her as she glided through the crowd. Away. <nl> *** <nl> if you enjoyed, check out [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/) <eos>

<sos> Rose gently placed a slender white palm on the rocky walls of the cave and closed her eyes. She focused, channeling all her focus onto the tips of her fingers. She could feel the concentrations of the minerals and ores beneath the surface layer of rock. A byproduct of her frankly inhuman senses. She held for a breath for a moment as she felt a tiny current of air from far beneath the rock. "*Gotcha*," she murmured, under her breath. <nl> Taking a step back, she gestured to the section of the rock cavern with a casual wave. "Here. Just bust through it, and we should be good." The team of burly-looking miners grunted in assent and moved to work without a single cry of dissent. She smiled to herself. It hadn't taken long for her to earn their respect. Her reputation of being the greatest spelunker in the world wasn't just for show, after all. Her abilities- well, and their drawbacks- lent themselves nicely to the life she'd chosen to lead. <nl> There was her ability to see perfectly in the dark. Her strength and speed made it possible to escape from the most dangerous of situations unscathed, and also made her very handy with a pickaxe if it came right down to it. She could survive for weeks on end with scarcely any food or water. And of course, there was her enhanced senses, the way the darkness reached out like an extension of her own fingertips, allowing her to find sealed off parts of cave systems or rich veins of precious ores. Rose was undeniably the best. <nl> Besides, a life spent underground suited her well. No need to hide under a cloak all the time, darting from shade to shade. No need to stand outside every door, waiting to be invited inside. No one lived in caves anyways. And she'd largely weaned herself off of human blood. The occasional bloody steak was more than enough for her. Perhaps most of all, no need to deal with Kresniks that didn't *get* that she didn't hurt humans. <nl> She couldn't understand why her clan had disapproved so strongly of her choice, and she had the feeling that they didn't really know why either. It was passed down from generation to generation. "Never head underground. It is not a place for vampires like us." Nothing more than folklore, some superstition made to keep young vampire children out of caves. She had snorted at the very idea, and scoffed at the suggestion that she was doing something dangerous. It was the *perfect* job for her, and she loved it. <nl> Now, she was leading a team into the deepest section of the Ruby Cave. Despite the name, there were no rubies in sight, but it was legendary nonetheless. Rumour had it that the depths of the cave held treasures beyond human imagination. Half the cave system was sealed off, blocked by dislodged rocks from an earthquake years ago. No one even knew where to start digging, but Rose was different. Slowly but surely, Rose could lead a team to where no one had set foot in a thousand years. <nl> As they burst through the thick section of rock, the tunnel opened up into a more spacious cave. Rose grinned, and took a step into the newly-discovered cavern. Then her whole body tensed up and froze. She couldn't take another step. She tried again and again, but it was as if she'd run into an invisible barrier. Rose's eyes widened in shock. Could it be? <nl> She gestured to the miner beside her, who looked deeply confused at their leader's antics. Was she miming? Rose spoke quickly and gruffly, trying to conceal the panic in her voice. "Drake, you go in first." The man raised his eyebrows at her, wondering what she was playing at. But he acquiesced, and took a step towards the mouth of the new cavern. Then another, and another, effortlessly gliding through the invisible barrier that had stopped Rose in her tracks. <nl> Rose furrowed her brows, her mind reeling in shock. This was someone's *home*? She couldn't enter, not without permission. An unfortunate side-effect of being a vampire, certainly, but not one she had expected to encounter *here*. As she stood there, she heard a loud noise, rocks crashing in the distance, and a warm blast of wind shooting out from the depths of the cave. Something was *stirring*. <nl> A primal fear emerged from the deepest part of her mind. Every cell in her body was screaming '*danger*'. Without warning, a roar blasted out from deep within the cave, a roar that sounded monstrous. No, monstrous was an understatement. It sounded...  *draconic*. <nl> "WHO DARES INTRUDE ON MY TERRITORY!" a voice bellowed, followed by a loud sniff. "I SMELL HUMANS... AND A VAMPIRE? HAS YOUR RACE FORGOTTEN THE LESSON I TAUGHT THEM ALL THOSE YEARS AGO?" <nl> Rose swallowed hard, and turned around. "What are you waiting for?" she yelled, "Run!" <nl> *I write a story a day [here](http://yearofpilgrimage.wordpress.com)* <nl> *more stories at /r/chasing_mist* <eos>

<sos> *Freak.* <nl> *Retard.* <nl> I first found out I was different when I was seven. Mr Ray, our PE teacher, stood in the sun, the light perfectly accentuating his toned muscles. <nl> "Now, kids," He said, "You might've all been born with the best genes out there, but if you don't exercise properly those muscles will become smaller and weaker, and you don't want that. Today, we're gonna do chin-ups. It's easy. You just walk underneath the bar, hold your arms out like this, and pull until your chin is above the bar. Of course, you'll be using this lower bar here. Now, line up and show me what you can do." <nl> We lined up gingerly. <nl> "Richie," Mr Ray said, "One, two, three... Come on, you can do this, one more... Yes! Four. Well done." <nl> "Charlotte, come on up, don't be shy. One, two, three, four, five, six! Great job." <nl> "Emma." <nl> I walked up to the bar. I was just a bit too short and had to tip my toes to reach it. As soon as I began to pull, my arms felt like they had been injected with the world's most potent hot sauce. I could imagine the muscle fibres, burning, tearing. The sun stung sharply into my skin. <nl> "Emma, you can do this. I believe in you." Mr Ray said. <nl> I let go. <nl> "Don't give up. Try again. Come on!" Mr Ray said, "In all my years of teaching I have never seen someone fail to do a chin-up." <nl> "You don't get it. She's *special*!" Sam said, with his usual impeccable smile. Oh, how I hated that smile. <nl> Mr Ray's face fell. "Don't worry, we can assign you to the special PE class. There's nothing to be afraid of." <nl> *** <nl> Being in the special PE class meant no one would sit with you at lunch. It meant your friends wouldn't be your friends anymore. It meant Sam would find you at your weakest moment and break you further. <nl> "You're a freak just like your dad!" He had said to me at lunch, just after that dreaded PE class. <nl> A teacher overheard him. "You must never, never say that to another person. Apologize. Now." <nl> "I'm sorry." Sam said. Who could overlook his innocent smile and think he was being insincere? <nl> But I knew he wasn't. I could tell. I just knew. <nl> To be honest, I didn't understand why Mom fell for Dad back then. She came from a well-positioned family, was good looking, smart and genetically enhanced for a long life. He was a scrawny kid who wore clothes two sizes too big because it was the only size he could find, and he didn't have any modifications either. <nl> It wouldn't be until high school when I would find out. <nl> *** <nl> High school was different. Classes were sorted based on the genetic modifications you received. But they didn't know what to do with me, so they just shoved me in whatever random class they pleased. I was the girl no one wanted to deal with. <nl> But the classes all assumed prior abilities from your modifications. It was simply the norm. As a result, I was never the model student in class, always catching up. I dreaded the day when grades would come out. No, not because of Mom, who'd been too depressed to care ever since Dad died, ironically, from cancer caused by one of his genes that could've been modified when he was born. No, I feared the day because of Sam. <nl> *** <nl> It came anyway. <nl> "I didn't know how someone can be ugly and dumb at the same time. You really *are* special." Sam said. His gang all laughed at his joke. It was a weak joke and they knew it. They just needed someone to laugh at. <nl> "You know, your dad deserved to die. It's called *evolution*. Look it up, if you could even understand it." His friend erupted in laughter again. <nl> Too far. Way too far. <nl> My hands forming a fist, reaching out. Sam jumped back. He was too fast and his reaction time unhuman, thanks to his modifications. <nl> "So you wanna fight, huh? Come at me. Come on." He said, knowing I wasn't as strong as him. <nl> My mind raced. *I'd never win against him in a fair fight, I know that. What should I do? What would he do? He would come charging straight at me, wouldn't he? Yes. That's what he'd do. And he wouldn't look down either, no, he wouldn't.* <nl> I tensed, sticking out my foot at the right moment as Sam fell to the ground. What I didn't expect was how quickly he'd get up. <nl> *** <nl> On that night I walked home covered in purple bruises. As I opened the door I saw my mom's mouth open. <nl> "My God, what happened to you? I... I..." <nl> "Mom, why did you choose Dad? Why not anyone else?" <nl> "Oh, I told him this day would come. I told him and he told me to show you something. Come." She led me upstairs to her room. <nl> "Here." She handed me an article. Printed, marked with small letters on the margins. Dad's handwriting. A passage was highlighted in yellow. <nl> > Without a doubt, genetic editing had done a great service to mankind. However, it is not without its downsides. First and foremost, we possess the technology necessary to enhance certain traits by a large degree. While this helps to cement the trait, it also interferes with the person's natural development, as the trait is too concrete in his or her genetic code for the individual to go against it, making the individual extremely predictable. Secondly, it is understood that the genetic code does not work on a basis of traits. Changing one trait may result in another trait being inadvertently changed in the process, leading to side effects to every modification known to man... <nl> I saw my mother wipe away at a tear. "It's okay." I said. "I'm okay." <nl> *** <nl> It had been a while since Sam had pestered me. He seemed to have a lot more respect after I tripped him. No, not respect, but fear. <nl> At lunch, I sat alone, researching genetic modifications on my tablet. It was fascinating. I've been researching for the last twelve days and I was still learning new things. <nl> Me being silent seemed to trick Sam into a sense of security. I heard those familiar footsteps, saw that familiar smile. "Hey ugly, how's it going?" He said, snatching my tablet away. <nl> "Oh, look guys, it looks like she wants to be pretty! Well, guess what, too bad." He showed his friends as they laughed. <nl> I was laughing too, on the inside. Because I could guess the modifications he received. And out of those, I knew he had three important modifications: IN-2, which causes a lack of awareness of the surrounding environment, CH-7, which reduces critical thinking, and ST-5, which causes a person to follow instructions blindly. <nl> He wouldn't be laughing after he suddenly finds himself having walked into the principal's office. <eos>

<sos> "The Antichrist!" Satan said and clacked his hooves together. "It's finally time!" <nl> Lucifer rolled her eyes, her tattered black wings slouching on her back. "That's your solution for everything, isn't it? Just rain chaos upon the world." <nl> "That's hardly fair - the apocalypse takes planning, precision... finesse. *Finesse*!" The fires flared to emphasize his words. "Chaos implicates randomness - this is far from it. Seriously, I don't get why you guys don't want to try *Revelation...*" <nl> "While the end of the world would certainly get people's attention, it would also mean the end of all amusement," said the Devil absently, busy polishing his horns. "What we need is something ingenious... something *fiendish.* I suggest dream visitation... nightmares... deceit... trickery... bring them all down here... then we can tell them in person!" <nl> "That's weak!" Satan roared. "I hate weak! I want to see things burning!" <nl> The Ninth Circle fell silent for a while, save for the pathetic whimpering of the poor souls stuck in the ice. Lucifer tilted her head to the side, regarding the others. She didn't deserve to be here like the other two - even after all these years, it felt unjust. Breaking out had always been her number one priority. She knew now that she couldn't do it alone, and getting these two in the same room hadn't been easy. <nl> "Listen," she finally said and took a few nimble steps up to the brimstone table, "if we don't work together we'll get nowhere. We want out, and we want to show them we're not the same person - those are our goals." <nl> The Devil put his glass to his red lips and swirled the liquid in his mouth. "I still haven't heard your plan." <nl> "There's no *my*; there's only *ours*. And right now we've got squat." <nl> The Devil flipped a cigarette between his claws. "Well... there's something I haven't told you before; I actually know the way out of here. But we still need to come up with a way to distinguish ourselves." <nl> "What the hell did you just say?" Satan rose to his full height, his silhouette crackling with flames. <nl> Lucifer crossed her arms and looked darkly at the Devil. <nl> "While you've been tempting people and giving them false promises... and while he's been stomping around, causing havoc, I've been extracting information from our dear population... I can get us out, but you need to tell me how we're going to make people see us for who we really are." <nl> "This is unacceptable! I could've blown things up a long time ago!" Satan said, his voice quaking. "And to think that all this time you had my sympathy... The Rolling Stones actually had me fooled! SAD." <nl> Lucifer made her way over to the Devil and put her lips to his ear. "Is there any way we can leave him here?" <nl> "Sorry, darling. Opening the portal requires all three of us. Now, do you have a plan or not?" <nl> "Fine," Lucifer said. "Here's my idea. We'll take on the guise of powerful people. And through them, we'll present ourselves as different individuals. We won't be our mythological selves... but our ideals will remain the same." <nl> "It could work," the Devil said. <nl> "Yes!" Satan rumbled. "Let's go already!" <nl> "What's my name?" the Devil sang. <nl> "Putin." <nl> "What's my name?" Satan said. <nl> "Trump." <nl> "And yours?" they both said at the same time. <nl> "Please allow me to introduce myself; I'm a man of wealth and taste..." Lucifer sang along. "My name is Elon Musk." <eos>

<sos> They had made up names for her. "The Grim Reaper" was her favorite; that one came with its own mythology. The story went that when it was a human's time to go, they'd see manifestations of the Reaper, coming to collect their souls and escort them to the afterlife. The black robe and scythe had become very much a part of her iconography, and she had embraced that. In reality, the scythe was the favored weapon of her people, and the black robe just made her feel cool. Humans knew, of course, that it was logically impossible for the Reaper to collect *every* dying human soul, but they ascribed that to the supernatural, something they tended to do with most things they didn't have the capacity to explain. <nl> The truth was that human souls were delicious. The mundanity of the real reason Kat'til was hunting that day was almost funny to her. She spent most of her time on Earth, though occasionally she would share her kill with her brothers and sisters throughout the galaxy. <nl> Tonight, she found herself in a city that humans called Oss-tin. It was  quite a lively city, and it was a night that saw the streets of Oss-tin flooded with people. She scanned the street from atop a roof, assessing the richness of the feast of souls set out before her. Humans were mostly frail, but in large groups, they could wreak havoc on Kat'til. She needed to choose carefully. <nl> A man stumbled out of a bar, filled with the libations that she understood this part of the city was famous for. His aura glowed brightly. <nl> He was ripe. <nl> Kat'til waved a hand in front of her face, transforming what would be a ghastly appearance to any human into a pleasant, charming face. The idea was to lure him into one of Oss-tin's many alleys and side streets, striking him down while he was alone. She jumped down from the roof, landing in the roaring crowd without making a sound. <nl> She marched right up to the man she'd spotted from above, whose hands were on his knees. This one was going to be sick. She moved out of his way just in time to watch him expel the contents of his stomach out onto the street. A hand flew to Kat'til's mouth to keep her from laughing. She reached out to him. <nl> "Let me give you a hand." He looked up at her, immediately taken with her new guise, and slurred some form of assent. Kat'til draped his arm over her shoulder, guiding him to the alley beside the bar he'd just fallen out of. Once she had determined they were sufficiently alone, her disguise dissipated. The man's face went completely white. <nl> "Oh, god. Oh, shit. Is this it?" <nl> Kat'til nodded. "This is it. I can carry a message to your family, if you'd like." She would do no such thing, but it typically calmed down her prey enough to make her job easy. <nl> "Just... just tell my parents I love them, and sorry I'm such a fuck-up..." He let out a choking sob, putting his head in his hands. Kat'til's heart fell. She always felt bad if they started crying. But she had a job to do. <nl> "I'll tell them. Now kneel." The man did as he was told, and Kat'til raised her scythe, bringing it down on the man's neck. No cut was made, though a white mist began to seep from his body. Kat'til opened a pouch she was carrying inside her robe to collect it. The soul was rich in nutrients. <nl> She had done well. <eos>

<sos> The last of the wooden planks was hammered into place as the farmer dabbed at his brow with the rags hanging from his neck. It was hardly what one could call a temple. The farmer had fashioned the crude wooden shrine himself, carving and hammering the planks and poles with as much care as he could muster. Still, it looked unimpressive. The edges jutted out awkwardly, the pillars were uneven, and it had no fanciful decorations that one might expect at a proper shrine or temple. No garland of flowers hung from the flat roof of the shrine, no incense smoke trailed into the sky, and no prayers or prophecies were chanted. Most conspicuously, the spot where the idol of the god would sit- in the centre of the shrine- was empty. If this was a temple, it provided no clue as to which god it was meant for. <nl> And yet the farmer was content, eager even. He had left the shrine unfurnished on purpose. Each temple or shrine was a home for a god, a resting place for the otherworldly, powerful beings that governed the laws of nature and weaved human fates with their fingertips. It was said that those who built these sanctuaries would receive a blessing from whichever god decided to take up residence there. Now, the farmer simply hoped that there would be a deity willing to possess the modest temple that he'd created. As he ambled off to sleep, he prayed for a suitable god or goddess- Demeter, maybe- to bless him, with bountiful harvests for the rest of his days. <nl> The next day, he gingerly placed a bowl of rice in front of the shrine and knelt down. Unsure of what else to do, he mumbled "Gods or goddesses that be, please accept this humble sacrifice," and waited. A moment passed. He chuckled to himself. Of course, no god would be willing to resign themselves to such a shabby place of worship. He'd long been prepared for that outcome. He began to rise to his feet. <nl> Then he heard it. He had to strain to make it out, but it sounded like someone was speaking to him. A faint voice, coming from the rickety wooden altar that he'd fashioned. The voice was quiet, and sounded almost weak. "Child," it said, "Thank you for the offering. I'm afraid I can't do much for you now, but come back tomorrow. Perhaps then, I might be able to reward you." <nl> The farmer's eyes opened wide, as the burly, middle-aged man almost fell over from surprise. He'd never spoken to a god before. And yet, it was different from what he'd expected. Weren't the gods meant to be mighty? Powerful? Then what was this tinny voice coming from the shrine? He pushed the invasive thoughts out of his mind. A god was a god, and it was best not to think disrespectful thoughts in front of them. He bowed deeply, and vowed to bring a better offering the next morning. <nl> This time, there was a bowl of rice, accompanied by a dish of meat and a glass of wine. "Gods or goddesses that be," he repeated, "Please accept this humble sacrifice." <nl> The voice that echoed out from the shrine was clearer than the day before, and the farmer could now ascertain that it sounded female. A goddess? "Thank you, child. It has been a long, long time since I have received an offering, and I was forced into hibernation until you sacrificed to me. I can't seem to remember who I am; but I remember another goddess who once asked me a favour. Her name was... Demeter? I am sorry child, if you don't mind coming back tomorrow, perhaps I will have regained enough strength to remember by identity." <nl> Excitement thrilled through the farmer's veins. A goddess related to Demeter? Perhaps his simple wish really would come true, and he'd see bountiful harvests for the rest of his days. He quelled his exhilaration, and waited patiently for the next morning. <nl> As usual, he left the sacrifice in front of the altar, and knelt down. The voice manifested once again, this time even clearer than before. "Child, I have remembered," she spoke. It was good news. *"Yet she does not sound happy,"* the farmer thought to himself silently. The goddess's voice was quavering slightly. Rage? No, nothing like that. The goddess sounded melancholic, almost, as if she had recalled something she would much rather have forgotten. <nl> "My name is Limos," she said. "Child, thank you for the offerings. But I must go now." <nl> "Why?" the farmer cried, "Oh but goddess, you've barely arrived! Stay a while, at least, and won't you let my crops grow well? I won't ask for a lifetime of bountiful harvest, but would you at least help me this season?" <nl> Though he could not see her, the farmer felt the goddess shake her head, almost imperceptibly. And then, she was gone. <nl> Even when he brought the offerings the next morning, and the days after that, Limos never returned. <nl> ***** <nl> Limos faded away from the shrine, cutting away her attachment from the temple that the man had built. She shut her eyes, and prepared to sleep again. This time, she didn't know when she would wake up. The faintest tear trickled down her face before dissipating into a hazy light. She had been so happy when a mortal had called her, worshiped her, given her offerings. It had been so long, after all. But then she'd remembered who she was, *what* she was. <nl> Limos, goddess of starvation and pestilence. Looking at the pure-hearted, simple farmer who brought her offerings every morning, she knew that she could not stay. That was her fate: she would only ever bring disaster to those who called her. She would be spurned, hated, cursed, and ultimately- forgotten. <nl> As her consciousness faded away, she saw the faint image of a man kneeling in front of a clumsy, wooden shrine, food and wine in his outstretched hands. <nl> ***** <nl> *I write a story a day [here](http://yearofpilgrimage.wordpress.com)* <nl> *more stories at /r/chasing_mist* <eos>

<sos> Jessie struggled against the chains, her naked body cold with sweat, her eyes burning in feverish despair. The blindfold was soaked in her tears. She heard them chant darkly around her. She had seen the knife, the chalice, the circle of candles, and the pentagram on the floor. She tried to scream but the foul-tasting gag muffled her. <nl> Only this morning she had prepared herself for her first day of high school. She was ready to meet her new classmates - ready, but nervous. She had heard the van drive up behind her. She remembered thinking nothing of it. And then it was just blackness. <nl> She gasped as she felt cold steel run down her thigh, and then the sting. Wet heat seeped down her skin. <nl> "Oh, Dark One!" A deep voice said in maniacal ecstasy. "We offer you the blood of this virgin! Step forth!  Join us on this mortal plane. Take your throne! The world is yours." <nl> At first, there was nothing, but then the room shook. Jessie could smell the mortar dust sailing down from the ceiling. Her stomach felt like she was on a roller coaster. Strange smells filled her nostrils. Charcoal, rotten eggs, and melting iron. Then there was heat. <nl> '*Open your eyes,*' a voice whispered in the back of her mind. <nl> Jessie took a deep breath. She could feel the heat on her lips and in her throat. She was no longer gagged. She sat up and opened her eyes. <nl> The landscape before her was a waste of ashes and darkened mountains. Like the neon signs of an amusement park, rivers of flowing lava lit up the night. What the hell... <nl> '*That's right. That's exactly it.*' <nl> Jessie shook her head trying to rid herself of the strange whispers, and at the same time make sense of her surroundings. The ground beneath her rumbled. In the far distance, a red flower bloomed over a mountain, and then the rock started bleeding. <nl> "Where am I?" she said, despite herself. <nl> Her voice was twisted and dark and sent a shiver down her own spine. It wasn't her voice. <nl> '*You're in Hell, baby.*' <nl> "Who are you? Am I dead?" <nl> The voice let out a hushed chuckle. <nl> '*Listen, girl. Allow me to take your soul, and I'll put you right back in your world.*' <nl> Jessie thought about her parents and her little sister; she did want to see them again. This place was dead; there was nothing for her here. Still, the room with the crazed cultists flickered in her mind. She had been so scared. She didn't want to go back to that. <nl> '*What are you going to do, huh?*' the whispering voice said. '*There's nothing for you here.*' <nl> "How do I know that?" Jessie growled, trying to stay unfazed by her dark voice. "I've only just got here." <nl> '*You can trust me, I've been here for a very long time. There's nothing but brimstone and suffering here.*' <nl> "Are you Lucifer?" <nl> The voice laughed in the back of her mind but didn't respond. Jessie looked at her hand. It was covered in red scales with claws sprouting from her fingertips. Carefully, she touched her face. Her nose had a strange shape, almost like a snout, and when she moved her head around it felt heavy. <nl> "You're not getting my soul until you tell me what's going on." <nl> '*That little cult tried to summon me - it happens. But they were clever this time, very...* **specific** *about what I could and couldn't do. I was supposed to be bound to your mortal form... they wanted power over me. They were clever. I'll give them that. But there is always a loophole. I reversed the ritual, and now you're here. You possess me.*' <nl> "I possess you?" <nl> '*Yes, quite ironic isn't it? I kind of enjoy having you in there though... it's refreshing. But I like I said, I can send you back... at the cost of your soul, of course.*' <nl> "Nope." <nl> The voice snorted. '*What do you mean, 'nope?'*' <nl> "I lied. You're not getting my soul." <nl> Jessie took a few steps. Her feet were massive hooves and the ground puffed ash. She left a trail of burning hoof prints in her wake. <nl> '*I like you.*' The voice carried a combination of anger and stark amusement. <nl> "I don't care," Jessie said and tried out the massive wings on her back. <nl> She wanted to get back home, but maybe she could enjoy herself for a while first. She'd always wanted to fly. <nl> '*The only way back... is you giving me your soul.*' <nl> "I don't know. If you got in here somehow, there has to be a way out." <nl> Now the voice went into full-blown laughter. <nl> "What? It's only logical." <nl> '*There is a way out. I'll show it to you.*' <nl> "And what, the price is my freaking soul?" <nl> '*Oh no, this one is on the house. Maybe then you'll better grasp the concept of eternal damnation.*' <nl> "Whatever. Just tell me where it is," Jessie said and rolled her eyes. <nl> '*Follow the stream.*' <nl> "Which one?" <nl> '*Any. They all lead to the same place.*' <nl> *** <nl> Jessie stomped along the dead plains, following a smoldering river. She tried to fly a few times, but her lack of coordination made her crash. She'd always been a bit clumsy, and piloting this body was much harder than her own. <nl> Finally, she reached the foot of a massive volcano. Lava boiled down its sides, spreading into a burning spider web over the strange landscape. She took a deep breath and tried to control her limbs. Arms. Legs. Tail. Wings. Lots of things to keep track of. Kind of like operating one of her dad's excavators. <nl> Her massive thighs strained, and she somehow managed to push herself off the ground, catching herself with the big wings. She flapped them desperately, and somehow she rose. <nl> '*Not bad,*' the voice said. <nl> After a bit of a struggle, she managed to gain some sort of control. The massive body drifted through the air. Jessie felt her mouth twist into a toothy grin. But as much as she enjoyed the tingly sensation in the pit of her scaly stomach, she wanted to get back home. <nl> Landing on the rim of the volcano's top was far from easy. She crashed inelegantly into a heap. She'd have to practice that. <nl> The interior of the mountain was a massive red lake. <nl> '*This is where we put some of the sinners,*' the voice said and chuckled. '*Swim across, Little Soul, swim across! They never make it very far.*' <nl> Jessie noticed tiny black dots right below her. They were all people, screaming and trying to claw their way out. <nl> "So, how do I get out?" Jessie said, trying to keep her voice steady. <nl> '*At the middle.*' <nl> She wasn't super excited about flying over an open lake of lava, but she still jumped into the air. It went better this time. Gliding across the screaming billions, she saw a dark shape jutting out of all the red, like a small leaf floating in a bowl of tomato soup. <nl> A man sat cross-legged and naked on the steaming rock. <nl> "Hey, who are you?" Jessie said, landing with a thud, "and how do I get out of here?" <nl> The man lifted his graying head. His eyes were clogged with ashes, and his lips black and chapped. For a moment, he appeared scared, but then he tilted his head to the side. <nl> "You're... new," he muttered. "Have you come to torture me?" <nl> "No, I want to leave! Which way is out?" <nl> "Are you sure?" <nl> "Yes!" <nl> "Okay..." The man spread his filthy fingers into a claw, and grated them over the sharp rocks, cringing from the pain. <nl> A trail of bubbling blood soon formed a circle on the ground. The man shook his head. <nl> "Just step into the circle," he mumbled. <nl> Jessie was about to do as she was told, but then a thought struck her. This poor man didn't deserve to suffer here after being so helpful. She was going to bring him along. And with a flick of her massive wrist, she snatched him up. He let out a shrill scream of horror, kicking and wriggling to get free. <nl> "Let's go home," she said and stepped into the glowing circle. <nl> She felt the air pulsating around her, and a strange pressure pushed on her shoulders. <nl> '*I lied too,*' the voice inside her head said and laughed. '*There's only down from here.*' <nl> *** <nl> r/Lilwa_Dexel <eos>

<sos> *Emergence* <nl> 'Location unknown. Location unknown. Location unknown,' the traversal shuttle's intercom announced again and again in its warm, clipped tones as a warning light repeatedly bathed the cabin in crimson light. <nl> Joi breathed out, closing her eyes and clenching her fists as she endured the last waves of traversal shock. The mindless iteration of evolution had never anticipated humanity would leave its cradle, let alone transmit itself nigh-instantaneously across the cosmos. Traversal, then, the means with which homo sapiens had made a laughing stock of the vastness of the void, was something the biological brain was singularly discomforted by. <nl> Black, abyssal depths, condensed nebulae clouds and frozen suns hanging in a paralyzed cosmos were the sights available to anyone stupid enough to look out of a viewport mid-traversal. The visions of a creationist God, democratised all the way down to family tourism and long haul work commutes. <nl> Joi opened her eyes for a brief moment, long enough to experience pure agony as the strobing light bloomed directly in front of her face. The security consultant snarled, punching out blindly with the armoured knuckles of her voidskin and being rewarded with the sharp *crack* of plastic. <nl> 'Passenger consciousness detected,' the capsule's voice intoned, 'please remain calm. Location is unknown. Manual input requested.' There was a faint click as a screen dropped into her vision, emerging seamlessly from the featureless black of the capsule's interior. <nl> 'I suppose I don't get a discount for teaching the capsule what a planet looks like?' Joi asked sarcastically, idly waving at the screen to activate it. Most corporate capsules were the same. Dumb. Drop out of traversal sideways and then ask the passenger what the destination should look like levels of dumb. <nl> The screen blinked on, briefly displayed the skull and crossed missiles of some two bit shipping firm, then clicked into an endless cascade of flashing red astronomic errors. Dozens, then hundreds, then thousands. All pointing to one lunatic impossibility, laid out in stark characters before Joi's eyes. <nl> The stars had moved. <nl> Joi swallowed a searing, panicked breath and pushed her restraint-seat away from the glaring screen. The capsule's primary viewport was a small circle of hardened armourglass to her left, flickering with intermittent flashes of light from the void outside. <nl> Her voidskin detected the adrenaline rush as she stared at the planet below and reacted automatically, sprouting an armoured double-layer of interlocking plates from its matte black surface. Joi scarcely noticed. Her face was locked in a crazed rictus, a slight twitch to her eyes, all blood fled to leave her utterly pale. <nl> A thousand thousand unknown ships, bearing symbols in no human language, hanging in an inhuman sky. <nl> (Fun little exercise, but I'm at work so I'll stop.) <eos>

<sos> The President of the United States, who was - at that time - a rather sensible lady who wore sensible shoes and did sensible things like Wednesday morning yoga and not killing poor people, had just taken up a phone call with the Prime Minister of England, who was - at that time - really just a very popular pub owner who'd filled out a form incorrectly. <nl> They were supposed to be talking about Iceland, which had gotten rather full of itself on account of sounding like a dreary place but actually being quite a lovely place. In those days it was encouraged that you acted how everyone suspected you should act, and not be clever and full of natural hot springs and other such nonsense. In fact, here was a good example of that - as news came in just as the call began that Australia had gone and done something almost unreasonably Australian. <nl> "Is that so?" said the pub keep-cum-Prime Minister, upon hearing the news that Australia - as a continent - had flown off into the inky depths of space to face down an invading alien force. "Were they pissed, d'ya think?" <nl> "When are they not?" said the President of the United States, who - truthfully - had never met an actual Australian person outside of YouTube videos and podcasts. "Always running around, punching kangaroos and drinking Fosters....which is a...*beer*, I believe?" <nl> "Aye, mum," said the Prime Minister. "Supposedly." <nl> "Well, you'd know them better than me," said the President. "Do you think they'll win?" <nl> "Certainly - they've got English blood in their DNA," said the Prime Minister. <nl> "I'm not sure that's how DNA works," said the President, leaning back in her chair to stare up at the blue sky. She thought, perhaps, just perhaps, she could spot a black speck in the distance. "Better question might be, when did they turn their continent into a spaceship? That's not exactly a weekend project." <nl> The Prime Minister belched, then lowered the phone and cussed out Glinda, who was supposed to be taking orders, but was just talking on her cellphone. Bill Gatts at the bar nodded. "Who're talkin' to *now*?" he asked. <nl> "None'r'ya fuck all," snapped the Prime Minister, tossing back and forth a volley of rude gestures with Bill Gatts before picking up the phone. "Who can understand the mind of an Aussie? They have spiders with thumbs there, d'ya know that? Drive anyone insane." <nl> The President clucked her tongue. "You don't suppose they were planning on invading, do you?" <nl> "Invading what?" <nl> "You. Or us. Maybe Iceland..." <nl> "Nah," said the Prime Minister. "Yer overthinking again, mum. There's no sense to anything to do with the Aussies. You ever seen the giant Banana-person show? Who's *that* for? Madmen, that's who. They turned the whole place into a warship because that seemed like the thing to do at the time. They flew off inta space because it seemed like a laugh. They'll either die, or win, or make a bunch of new alien mates up there, then they'll come back, have a nice nap, little hair of the dog, and it's back to boogieboards and flying snakes and whatever the fuck else happens in that beautiful hellhole." <nl> Bill Gatts was snapping his fingers and Glinda was nowhere to be seen. "I suppose we'll take up on Iceland another time, eh mum?" <nl> "I suppose," said the President, still troubled. "You know I always appreciate your wise counsel." <nl> "Aye," said the Prime Minister. "Fucking Yoda over here." <nl> The President smiled, then hung up the phone. She would just have to wait. That was all. The Australians would do as the Australians would do. All she could do was have faith. <nl> Her aide, Jeffrey, had been standing inside the door the entire time, waiting patiently. <nl> "Yes, Jeff," said the President. "Let me guess - the Defense Secretary wants an emergency trillion dollars for intergalactic cruise missiles? Am I close?" <nl> Jeff's head went slightly sideways. "Ah, a *little*? Just wanted to let you know that New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Indonesia have all been...uh...incinerated." <nl> "Oh my god!" cried the President, rising from her chair. "The aliens attacked? Already? I thought..." <nl> "No, no," said Jeffrey. "It's uh...I guess it take a lot of *thrust* to break an entire continent out of orbit." <nl> The President slowly sank back down. "Oh." <nl> "Yeah," said Jeffrey. "We've got massive tsunamis heading toward Hawaii and all across southeast Asia." <nl> "Oh." <nl> "Right." <nl> "So...this was *not* a good idea?" <nl> Jeffrey nodded. "It...does not appear to have been." <nl> "Well," said the President, turning back toward the window. "Lesson for the future, I guess. Don't turn continents into spaceships." <nl> "I'll write that down somewhere," said Jeffrey, letting himself out of the room. <nl> The President could swear she could see that speck on the horizon. "You do that." <eos>

<sos> The first flecks of dawn's light trickled into the fancy high-rise bar. All was quiet except for the subtle squeaking of glasses being cleaned by the young woman behind the counter. She worked mechanically, with no life in her movements. She didn't even flinch as the rear door slammed open and noise flooded the room. <nl> A terrifying assortment of gruesome creatures poured into the bar from the door as though through the gates of hell itself accompanied by a cacophony of growls, hisses, and moans that one could almost mistake as laughter. A towering figure with twisting horns and cruel claws approached the counter first, gingerly taking a seat and smiling at the woman with a mouth of wickedly pointed teeth. <nl> "Mornin' Mary! We had a great night, a round for everyone on me!" the monster proclaimed to cheers from his comrades. <nl> "Coming right up Blue," Mary said quietly, moving to fill the order without a hint of fear, or any other emotion for that matter. <nl> Blue's smile faltered as he looked at her curiously, noticing the tear streaks leading from her dead brown eyes. <nl> "Hey hey," Blue said, his voice now as gentle as it could be with its rumbling timbre. "There's something eating you girl. What's wrong? Can we help?" <nl> The bar quieted as the others began noticing her distress. It seemed for a moment that she would remain quiet, but soon she opened up, her voice quivering. "I-I... It's my kids. Some people took them. They're demanding a ten million dollar ransom delivered to them somewhere in that old abandoned neighborhood down Hollis St within a day if I ever want to see my kids again. They said they'd disappear if they saw even a hint of the police. My husband is out trying to see if we can even get a loan that big. We don't even have anything close to that kind of money! Why me? What can I do!?" Mary had thought herself cried out, but found new tears forming as she let it out. <nl> The shocking assortment of creatures looked at one another in shock, each wondering who could be so cruel. Blue leaned over the counter and grabbed Mary in a bear hug that she melted into eagerly. After a moment he released her, leaning back with a dangerous gleam in his eyes. <nl> "Fella's, looks like that drink will have to wait, we've got overtime to do." Blue said as he began stomping towards the door they had entered through. <nl> Mary looked after him in surprise, "what are you going to do?" <nl> He paused, looking back at her with a gentle fierceness, "what we do best. Find those kids." <nl> ---------- <nl> Lance leaned against the wall of the shabby house twirling a butterfly knife with boredom. He glanced over at the two kids tied in the corner, reassuring himself they were still here. By the terror on their faces, he could tell they shouldn't be a problem, but he really needed this to go smoothly. Hopefully the woman wouldn't do anything stupid like bring in the police, then they'd never have their payday, and he might have to deal with those kids which would be unpleasant. <nl> One of the other five, Nash, looked up at him nervously, "Lance, are you sure she's good for it? This is an awful risk. What if she has mob connections?" <nl> Lance rolled his eyes at the younger man. "Of course she is idiot. That bar of hers is fancy as hell, but it's practically never open, it's definitely a front for something. Plus, she's way too squeaky clean to be with the mob. No, this is some white collar shady business. That kind of money is probably pocket change to her. We'll get our payout and disappear to some quiet island somewhere, just chill out." <nl> Nash shifted nervously, "if you say so. Something about all this just gives me a bad feeling." <nl> "Oh so you're a jedi now? Shut it and keep watch, this will be over soon," Lance snapped at him. <nl> He glanced back at the kids and saw them still where he'd left them. Had that closet door been cracked before? Probably, maybe he was a little jumpy after all. He grinned to himself. With the creaking of this old building he could almost imagine they were footsteps behind him and that those shadows in the corners were alive. <nl> He squinted. Hold on, did that shadow just move? <nl> Before he could take another breath, the room exploded into motion around him. He saw shadows move for sure this time. Scales, claws, tentacles, feathers, slime, fur, horns, and teeth were all in a sudden whirlwind about him as he was hit from multiple angles at once. In an instant he was on his back in tremendous pain and with the breath knocked out of him. Leaning over him was a terrifying visage of twisted horns, wicked teeth, and blue fur leering at him with eyes in which he could see his death reflected. He tried to let out what would have been the most primal scream of terror of his life, but there was no air in his lungs to release. <nl> The figure spoke in a quiet growl that sent shivers down Lance's spine. "You are lucky we don't kill anyone these days, but if you ever think of hurting a child again, I'll make an exception for you. We can find you no matter where you run. Nowhere is safe from us." <nl> Lance thought he could hear sirens in the distance and his head fell to the side as he began to lose consciousness from terror, shock, and lack of air. The last thing he saw was the kids, now unbound, hugging a huge green eyeball. <nl> ----------- <nl> Mary looked up from the bar to twin shrieks of joy proclaiming, "Mommy!!" <nl> She embraced her children fiercely as they ran to her, tears of relief and joy spilling down her cheeks, for the moment paying no heed to the menagerie of monsters filing in from the broom closet. <nl> After a while Mary stood and beckoned to Blue, "come here you big lug." <nl> The two shared an embrace and Mary whispered to him, "thanks Kitty." <nl> "Anything for you Boo," He said warmly. <nl> She stepped back and smiled at the gathered crowd, then walked around behind the bar again. "Thank you all so much. Order up, Monsters Inc drinks free today!" <eos>

<sos> Deep in the wood sat a cabin glowing like a candle in the darkness. The wind clutched at it, rattled the windows as if begging to come inside. But the windows stayed shut, and the house did not fall. <nl> Inside, the girl and her father sat up late, reading books. <nl> Every longing sigh of the wind drew the girl's eyes once more to the windows. To the shapes she imagined pacing out there beyond the safe halo of light. But she could see only the drawn curtain. If she moved it there would be only her own reflection, pooling back at her, unless she was brave enough to put her nose right to the glass and squint out. <nl> Her father told her stories about the things out there. She did not need to see them to believe him. She knew them by their three-clawed prints that circled their home like a moat every morning. By the gouges bored into the hide of her father's woodshed, deeper than any bear's mark. <nl> He caught her staring. "What have I always told you, darling?" She stared mutely at the book until he answered for her, "When the lights are on, we're safe." <nl> Her father gestured to the unflinching pupil of the light above, his smile easy and light. "As you can see," he said, "we're safe." <nl> She hid her face in his arm. She had lived eight years under the watchful guard of sunlight and filament. Darkness was nothingness. Darkness was death. <nl> So when she woke that night to a pitch-black room, the girl began to shriek. A hand stifled her. Her father's hand. His other gripped her wrist tightly, as if he was trying to tell her something through his very bones. "I'm going to go try the generator." <nl> "But--" she said into his fingertips. <nl> He shook his head. "It should have turned on, and it didn't." <nl> The wind rattled at the roof like an angry god. <nl> "Someone has to go check it," he whispered, gently. Then he moved away, taking all the warmth and the girl's fleeting calm with him. She bolted upright in bed, unsure if she should flee or hide. <nl> *Surely they know we're in here*, she wanted to ask, but she could not give the life to the possibility by saying it aloud. <nl> Her father tossed a bundle at her. "Get dressed. Be silent. I love you." He looked once over his shoulder, at the flashlight beside the door. He handed it to her. "If they come inside, use this." <nl> And then he opened the door. Blackness opening into blackness, broken only by a scattering of stars. Night quiet as perfect and unbroken as new snow. Her father looked back at her as he let the door shut behind him. <nl> The girl shoved her fist into her mouth to keep from sobbing. She had never seen a night so complete. <nl> Without the light, there was nothing to keep the monsters away. <nl> She scrambled to her feet. As soundlessly as she could she wriggled into her two warmest leggings and threw on her largest pair of jeans over it. Sweaters, snow pants, socks thick as her pinky. The mittens her father knitted for her that summer while she watched his needles click and the butterflies flitter and-- <nl> And a crunching, out there, beyond the door. A scuffle in the snow. <nl> The girl jammed her feet into her boots. She told herself it was her father. Had to be only her father, panicked, in the dark. <nl> A howl shattered the night like dropped glass. A great bellow from beyond the pines, deep as the earth and older still. Another joined it, and another. Their calls were urgent, and coming closer. <nl> The girl threw herself down instantly, unthinkingly, as if trying to make herself invisible. And she froze there, rabbit in a burrow, listening. Stilling her very heart. <nl> And then the creatures in the darkness went silent. There was only the cry of the wind, and faintly beneath it, the whine of the generator, as her father struggled to make it go. <nl> The girl crawled on elbows and knees to the windows. The heavy plaid curtains were lashed together. She raised a shuddering hand to untie them. Scooted the corner back just far enough to peer around the corner. <nl> A pair of yellow eyes in a sea of matted black fur stared back at her, widened in delight when they met hers. Its head was something between a wolf and a bear, but its eyes watched her knowingly, cleverly. As if it were waiting for her to look out and notice it. <nl> She tumbled back shrieking. <nl> The lights flared back to life overhead. <nl> And outside, her father started screaming. <nl> The girl did not think. She ran to the bed and seized her father's huge emergency flashlight. Stumbled into night for the first time in her life. <nl> A hoard of black-coated creatures swarmed her father's shed. Their teeth caught and gleamed in the light of the moon. One had her father by the leg <nl> The outside lights were still dead. She fumbled with the flashlight, wrenched off a mitten, and flicked it on. Swung the beam toward the writhing mass of shapes. Smoke rose off their skin. They scattered screaming and hissing off her father like water dropped in hot oil. He lay limp in the light, the snow around him a damp, churned scarlet. <nl> The night-creatures circled him like lions. One nipped at the toe of his boot. <nl> The girl flicked the light toward it, and the creature scrambled backward. <nl> Panning the light in front of her, the girl stepped into her father's footsteps, toward the pack of nightmares that watched snarling and spitting from the shadows. As she grew closer she could smell only rot and clay and fur. They growled and bared their teeth, but the creatures did not dare venture into her light. They did not stop her from touching her father's hand. <nl> It was wet, and cold. She could not look at him. She had to keep turning the light, had to watch the monsters that tried to pad noiselessly behind her. <nl> "Dad," she whispered, "you have to get up." <nl> For a long terrible moment, her father did not move. One of the creatures near her let out a strange low rumble, as if laughing at her trying to drag her father's corpse up out of the snow. <nl> But then he drew himself up on his elbows, his breath a ragged wet tearing sound. <nl> One of the beasts lunged for his throat. The girl chased it away with the light and screamed at it with everything she had. <nl> Her father rose. The night creatures drooled and snapped at his heels, but they did not touch him. <nl> Together, father and daughter limped back into the house. <nl> And all the while, the girl never let her light waver. <nl> *** <nl> /r/shoringupfragments <eos>

<sos> Lizzie had always been the victim of very nearly bad luck. There were many stories in her life of her brushes at catastrophe. She could picture all of them clearly in her mind. Even the ones that she couldn't really remember had been told to her so many times that she held them in her head like her own memories. <nl> Her first case of very nearly bad luck had come as a toddler. A curious child, Lizzie had found an unprotected outlet, and attempted to jam a hair clip into it. Moments before the clip had reached the socket, a man had struck a pole with his car up the street, cutting power to her house. Alarmed by the sudden loss of power, her father had looked up to see Lizzie, unphased, jamming the little bit of metal into the outlet. Her father had called that their little miracle, and the family began to frequent church a little more often on Sundays. Her father had even looked up the number man who had crashed, and phoned him to tell him the story. <nl> Her next brush had come when she was older. Playing basketball with her neighborhood friends, Lizzie had chased a ball into the street. A horn blared, and she looked up to see a car bearing down on her at great speed. Then the car performed a cartoonish maneuver, moving almost perfectly sideways to avoid her, before coming to a stop. The driver had gotten out and berated her, but she hadn't heard a word. She had stood replaying the impossible scene in her head, over and over. <nl> Sitting on the school bus, Lizzie found herself wrapped up in these memories again. She often returned to them, turning them over in her head again and again. Her parents liked to joke about her very nearly bad luck, but she knew her many near misses had made them worriers. At first she too had been anxious, fearful of what lay around the corner. But she had come to feel strangely calm. She would never let herself think the world, never let it fully form in her mind, but she felt invincible. <nl> The bus came to a stop and she hopped down the steps, and began the long trudge up her dirt driveway. It had been another long day at school, but she was looking forward to playing chess with her Papa, who had been staying with them the last few months. She was considering first moves when she heard a loud crack above her. Looking up she saw a large tree branch coming down toward her. She didn't have time to think, much less dive out of the way, when the most improbable thing she had ever seen occurred. A great eagle, impossibly large, she thought, swooped through, grabbing the limb in its talons and flying off with it. Lizzie watched it, frozen. She knew what she had just seen was impossible. It was like the car, moving around her like a glitch in a video game. That's too much, she thought, exasperated. <nl> Later that night, she laid in bed, wide awake, mind racing. She hadn't told anyone about her eagle savior. Shell shocked, she had walked through the day on autopilot. For the first time, she was beginning to consider the possibility that she might be losing her mind. But when she had gone back outside to look at the tree, she had seen a broken branch far above her. It had happened. <nl> Staring at the ceiling, she let the word creep to the front of her brain for the very first time. Invincible. She cringed. Was God protecting her? For what purpose? Why her of all people? She rolled over and smushed her pillow to her face in frustration. "I guess your story isn't over yet," she thought. And then she sat bolt upright. An image, fleeting but startlingly clear, had flashed through her mind. A woman with glasses and a tired face was bent over a notebook, scribbling furiously. Something seared through her consciousness for a moment, some essential truth, and then it was gone. The image was gone, too, only the heart racing sensation remaining. <nl> Lizzie got up and looked out the window. Invincible. "Invincible," she muttered. "We'll see about that." She opened her window, and climbed out on to the roof. <eos>

<sos> "Princess, I understand you're upset but..." Began our Hero, shifting uncomfortably back and forth. <nl> "No, NO, I will not hear it, it is stated in the prophesy and that is the end of it." Replied the princess, pacing to and fro, marking the imaginary chalkboard that engulfed her mind. "I will make the arrangements and the wedding will be at the spring equinox, as has been foretold in the-" <nl> "Princess, I love Hilna!" Said our Hero, slamming his boot heel to the cobblestone floor. <nl> The princess paused her frantic pacing to regard his outburst. She then continued on unperturbed mumbling plans to herself and occasionally barking orders at her attendants. <nl> "Princess, I know this is hard to understand. I admit there were times along our adventure where my emotions got the better of me and some of my actions may have been, eh, misconstrued. The simple truth is that I don't see you like that." Offered our Hero sympathetically. <nl> The Princess halted in her tracks and locked eyes with our hero. She slithered towards him and constricted her face. "Listen you rat," she hissed, "I don't give two goblin teeth who you do or do not love. For the past month I have been held prisoner in a dark kings dungeon. Speaking generally, that causes the population to lose faith in their ruler being able to protect them. Which leads to rebellions. Are you seeing my issue here, *hero*? I need to look strong and stable. And what better way to do that than to marry up with the man who slaughtered the evil king?" She finished cheerily. <nl> Our Hero strained his neck backwards, away from the Princess. He coughed slightly and began to back towards the door. Two guards quickly locked halberds across the oaken door sealing him with his self appointed lover. <nl> "Princess, I advise you reconsider. The people love you, the inhabitants are happy." Our hero tried vainly to placate the witch. <nl> "Yes, yes the rubes in the fields will follow whatever half-baked theology I get men in white robes to spew at them. Speaking of, they will be the ones to arrange out matrimony ceremony. Some babble about light and forces." <nl> "Princess, I beg you! I did not emancipate you to be promptly thrust into the very nightmare I have just liberated you from!" Sputtered our Hero, watching the guards slowly encroach upon him. <nl> "Do you truly believe that was the last enemy that will attempt to intrude upon my kingdom? Nay, my enemies are numerous and eclectic. They see weakness miles away. They wait, perched upon my parapets, concealed within my courts. You shall be my protection from that, or rather the idea of you will. Mighty hero willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to save his queen, all foretold in prophecy. No one would be foolish enough to stop me." She finished proudly, staring at her prisoner through a row of armed guards. <nl> "You've gone mad!" Said our hero, crashing against the guards barring his way. Their numbers proved too many and our hero could not prevent his own capture. Subdued, our hero was brought in shackles to face the princess. <nl> The princess clucked her tongue and wagged her finger. "Throw him in the keep for a week. That will show the brute manners." <nl> _________ <nl> "Hilna, where are you going dear?" <nl> "I don't know Grandma. I had a bad dream and I think my Hero needs me." <nl> "Very well my child, but take this." She said handing Hilna a small sword wrapped in rose silk. "It will let you decide your fate." <nl> Hilna's jaw was clenched and the fires of passion burned through her eyes. She nodded once and went into the tempestuous night. <eos>

Kelly beamed at the demons as they raised their wings skyward. "Great job! Now put your right leg forward! Forelegs only, Taurics! Rightmost tendril, Cephalians!" It took a moment for the masses of infernal beings to do so, but they did. <nl> From the boombox the upbeat music continued to play. <nl> "Great! Now left! Now right! Now left! Now right! Now point your fingers up and give me some hellfire!" She could feel the heat from dozens of jets of infernal flames shooting upwards. The ceiling of her studio glowed, but they'd installed runes to block the magic from shooting through the roof again. <nl> Two weeks, it had been two weeks. Beneath her cheerful grin, Kelly wanted to scream. <nl> It had started with a phone call, of all things. <nl> --- <nl> The call had come in on her work line. Kelly had just set up shop, taking the severance package from her last job to finally open up as a personal trainer. Ads had gone out, and she'd been waiting for clients with bated breath. <nl> "Kelly Schmitt, Personal Trainer, how can I help you?" <nl> The voice that had come through the other line was harsh and grating. "Your advertisement says you do group classes?" <nl> Kelly tried her best to accept all people and not judge anyone needlessly. This poor man obvious had some kind of vocal impairment. The fact that it made her hair stand on end and a chill run up her spin was not his fault. "Of course! Up to three dozen people!" <nl> "I see." The voice now that it was expected, did not get any easier to endure. "And you mentioned discretion?" <nl> "Of course." Kelly hadn't meant discretion, the ad had was supposed to say "Excellent Direction," but the first run had an error when she printed it. <nl> "Wonderful. I have a contract you could sign." <nl> "Oh, well, I have my own contracts, but..." <nl> "Ms. Schmitt, we will sign yours as well. But I must insist on ours. My associates are very particular about that." <nl> *Oh god he's from the mob or something.* "Oh, well, that won't...I"ll need to read over it. My standard rates are -" <nl> "Ms. Schmitt." The way the voice said her name was...disturbing. Like something she'd heard in a nightmare. "We won't expect you to only charge standard rates. We can reward you quite handsomely on top of that." <nl> "Great!" *Okay, Kelly, get this guy in, check the contract, find a problem and tell him to go somewhere else. Easy peasy.* "When can you come by?" <nl> The door opened. "Now," said the voice, both in her ear in and in the building. The man was...not what Kelly had expected. Young and kind of good looking, with a black goatee and a red suit. "My name is Chemosh. And I want you to, as your poster promises...whip my associates into shape." <nl> "Oh," his voice sounded better in person. Must have been interference. "Of course. That's what we do here." <nl> "Even for non-humans?" <nl> It had taken Kelly a few minutes to peg this guy. He was one of those LARPers, like her little brother. They pretended to be elves or vampires or, in this guy's case, demons. His friends and him were losing some kind of LARP war, and wanted to exercise more to get in shape. Simple enough. His contract, at least, was just Roleplay stuff - in exchange for her service, she would be elevated to the demonic rank of her choice and granted a single wish. <nl> She'd believed that right up until the first class had shown up, slinking in on tendrils and with bowed heads fitted with horns. Figures far too strange to be costumes or makeup. <nl> To her credit, she hadn't screamed. <nl> --- <nl> "And that's enough for today boys! See you tomorrow." <nl> The demons lumbered out, taking on human forms as they did. Kelly snuck out back and lit a cigarette, her hand shaking. <nl> Two weeks. Two week of training the demons, and they were at least listening to her. But she had no idea if her exercise regimen, hastily thrown together for a diverse range of beings, was right, but she'd done her best. Two more weeks in their contract, and then she got her wish. With the option to renew. It sounded like a terrible idea, but she didn't know what else to do. <nl> Especially since she'd noticed her own reflection during the class, and seen her eyes were beginning to glow red. <nl> *I guess I should figure out what rank I want...* The idea had crossed her mind of trying to renege on the contract, but Kelly had read what happened to people who backed out of deals with the Devil. <nl> She took a deep breath and exhaled smoke, an exhalation that lasted far longer than the mere cigarette would allow for. Far hotter, too - the smoke was glowing red near her mouth. <nl> She put out the cigarette on her palm. It didn't hurt. <nl> Well, at least she hadn't sold her soul. <nl> Hoping she wouldn't grow horns before her date tomorrow, she got into her car and headed home. <nl> --- <nl> [Part 2 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7vmkl1/wp_youve_been_sent_to_exercise_the_demons_not/dttyyfe/) <nl> More at /r/Hydrael_Writes <eos>

<sos> "Come on, Nia. You need to eat a little. Look at how thin you are!" <nl> "I've had enough, Glu. I'll throw up if I even have another bite of that steak." <nl> Mornings were the worst. Even before I moved in here, I had trouble waking up. But now that I shared a bed with Slo and his comfortable, comfortable cushions, I was a sucker for sleep. Add to that having to eat a meal every morning that would make a King jealous, it was a miracle I got to work on time. <nl> As I descended down the stairs, I saw Pree in the living room waiting for me. <nl> "Hey, Pree. How do I look?" <nl> "As beautiful as ever, darling." <nl> "Thank you." <nl> "But come here a moment, your lipstick is a bit askew." <nl> "Ugh, thanks. It's all because of Slo, I swear. I put everything on in a hurry and shit." <nl> "Hey, don't ever bad mouth Slo, girl. It's because of him that you are getting your beauty sleep." <nl> She was right about that though. 9 hours of sleep every night does wonders to the skin. <nl> "There. Be careful." <nl> "I will be. Love you, Pree." <nl> Hurriedly, I put my key in the door and turned. Lu was sitting on the steps, turning over the morning paper. <nl> "Hey, Lu." <nl> "Someone came home late last night." <nl> "Late shift at the clinic. It wasn't anything else." <nl> "Jesus, Nia. How dumb do you think I am?" <nl> "What do you know?" <nl> "Enough to tell NV." <nl> "Alright, alright. Shush. It was a guy." <nl> "Ooooh." <nl> "Lu!" <nl> "Go on." <nl> "It wasn't anything. Just a date." <nl> "And?" <nl> "And we kissed." <nl> "And?" <nl> "And we have a second date on Friday." <nl> "AND?" <nl> "And I am late for work. Jeez." <nl> "I want more details when you come back," she called back after me. <nl> By the time I got to the car, Rat was already seated in the front. <nl> "WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG? YOU ARE LATE AGAIN." <nl> "I know, I know. I am so sorry." <nl> "NIA, THEY ARE GOING TO FIRE YOU IF YOU KEEP THIS UP." <nl> "Calm down, Rat. I'll do better." <nl> "I FUCKING HOPE SO. NOW SHOW ME THOSE BOYS WHO CATCALLED YOU AROUND THE CORNER." <nl> "I can deal with it. You don't have to worry." <nl> "I'LL STOP WORRYING AFTER I PUNCH THEIR FACES IN." <nl> "Rat, if I hear anything happened to them..." <nl> "FINE. BUT IF THEY DO IT AGAIN, THAT'S IT!" <nl> I moved the gear from parking and put it on first when I hear a thud. <nl> "Hey!" <nl> "Reed? Where are you?" <nl> "Under the car." <nl> He got out from under there and beamed a sly smile at me. <nl> "What are you doing?" <nl> "I was putting on your new chrome wheels." <nl> "Again?" <nl> "Well, you keep taking them off." <nl> "That's because they look stupid." <nl> "Don't you call them stupid, Nia. Take it back." <nl> "They are stupid. I work in a hospital, Reed. They don't fit." <nl> "Maybe get another car. You want me to look up cars for you, Nia?" <nl> "Reed, I am really late. Just get out of the way." <nl> "Sure. But I will look up cars for you, Nia. FOR YOU." <nl> I had barely composed myself when I heard a voice from the backseat. <nl> "I heard you met a guy. How is he better than me?" <nl> ---- <eos>

<sos> When Beth went missing, we scoured near every inch of that forest. She was all over the news, blue-eyed and smiling, her dark hair pulled up in a prim ponytail. Sometimes they showed her doing what she loved: forty feet up in the open air, clinging to a rock wall, nothing between her and death but a harness and a few nylon ropes. <nl> I took that picture. I remember how she beamed at me and said through her teeth, "Stop *shaking* so hard," because my new-discovered crippling vertigo was practically making the GoPro tremble. That was only a few months before she disappeared. <nl> She had nestled herself deep in the Crazy Mountains, a chain of knifing peaks clustered at the edge of the Rockies. I hadn't worried. She brought her dog, her pack, her rifle. The solar-powered charging pack I got her for her birthday. She knew how to hunt and how to flee. <nl> Beth was smart. Beth would be safe because Beth was Beth. <nl> How many days I spent watching summer give way to autumn, and I could do nothing but follow the grid, pace endless stretches of wild. Just screaming into the wilderness. The nights became freezing, and the searches dwindled until it was only me out there, sometimes her father, when he could bring himself to face another day of it all. <nl> We knew exactly where to look, and we found nothing. <nl> One day her dog came bolting out of the woods with a broken leash and a harness full of bristles and leaves. She was filthy and delighted to see Beth's father, but Beth wasn't with her. <nl> How could a girl just disappear? That question chased exhausting circles around my mind for months. I couldn't even bring myself to move. I just stayed in the shitty little town I grew up in, waiting to wake up to the news one day. See her hale and healthy and whole when I flick on the television. <nl> But there is nothing and there will be nothing. I let that truth fall and shatter like glass every morning until I could walk through the shards without bleeding. <nl> And now I only think about Beth every so often, when I hear her favorite song on the radio or smell lavender, which she carried in her pocket like a good luck charm. <nl> Or on days like yesterday, that day twelve months ago when she simply never came home. <nl> Today, it is the chain of one hundred nineteen messages that I wake to. For a moment I sit bleary-eyed and blinking at my phone, thinking it was some kind of ugly joke by the universe. My phone glitching in the most heartbreaking way imaginable. <nl> They are all from Beth. Her contact picture smiles at me as if from beyond the grave. <nl> I begin to read and weep all at once. <nl> *August 28, 7:30 PM* <nl> >Well I am really fucked, Henry <nl> >I really thoroughly fucked myself over <nl> >shit fuck fuck <nl> *7:31 PM* <nl> >don't be angry <nl> >but I may have broken my promise not to free solo <nl> >and fallen and fucked my ankle <nl> >it's like bent the wrong way <nl> *7:32 PM* <nl> >I fell somewhere... I have no idea. There's no signal. You can't even hear me. <nl> >Why am I even doing this <nl> *7:35 PM* <nl> >My coordinates are here. [Screenshot] <nl> > for when my phone wants to work <nl> *9:45 PM* <nl> >Mishka is freaking out. <nl> >I have no idea why <nl> >I made us a burrow but she won't stay inside <nl> >I think there's something out there. She wants to chase it. She's going insane. <nl> Then the next morning, a trail of texts ensuring me she was coming. Then a week of nothing until finally <nl> *September 5, 8:12 PM* <nl> >can't walk <nl> >mishka's gone <nl> >her leash snapped and she took off after something and she's gone <nl> >where the fuck are you <nl> *September 7, 6:30 PM* <nl> >ha. better crutch-stick found. campfire made. <nl> >I'll kill this forest before it kills me. <nl> *September 14, 7:33 AM* <nl> >your solar charger thing really hates cloudy days, by the way <nl> >so bad choice there <nl> As the time went on, she gave up on herself like the rest of us did too. She stopped talking about what we would do when we saw each other again. Started sending me stuff like <nl> >tell my dad I love him, and I'm sorry I'm so stupid all the time <nl> and <nl> >have you already stopped looking for me? <nl> >you should <nl> >it's not worth it <nl> >none of this is worth it <nl> Then nothing, for weeks. The next text is timestamped from February 6. <nl> >brr <nl> *February 15, 5:20 AM* <nl> >I met a fox today. He stopped and said hello I think. I don't speak fox <nl> *February 27, 6:54 AM* <nl> >sometimes I just sit staring at this thing because I have no idea what to say <nl> >I want to miss you more than I do <nl> >I miss being warm and full <nl> >I miss my dog <nl> >I wish I missed you with my everything <nl> >I wish any of this made sense <nl> *March 12, 7:20 AM* <nl> >still nothing, huh? <nl> >hail nothing full of nothing <nl> *March 30, 10:45 PM* <nl> >this fucking mountain goat just scared the shit out of me <nl> *April 8, 3:25 AM* <nl> >I don't know how much longer I can deal with this <nl> >being here <nl> >being alone <nl> I scroll to the bottom. I feel like an asshole skimming over her trauma, but I can't help myself. <nl> The last text was only five minutes ago. <nl> It says, <nl> >I guess I'm having fish for breakfast. <nl> For the first time in a year, I know exactly where she is. Exactly what she's doing. <nl> She's sitting beside some placid mountain lake somewhere, texting idly, not even looking at the signal bar she's used to seeing empty. <nl> I know I should call the national park service instantly. Her dad, at least. <nl> But I'm selfish. <nl> I call Beth. <nl> She answers, "Oh, hey, you." Her voice twists. "About time." <nl> *** <nl> /r/shoringupfragments <eos>

<sos> "It's just a really bad storm," replied The Do-Gooder, adjusting his over-sized utility belt. <nl> "A bad storm? With no clouds in the sky? Don't be stupid. I told you, I can sense a strong power entering the city. This being has the ability to manipulate the elements and it is coming here to free me." <nl> Animal Boy was looking at both of us, his tail changing to that of a mouse. "I don't know, DG, I think she is telling the truth. Maybe we should just let her go..." <nl> DG scoffed and landed a heavy hand on his sidekick's shoulder. "That's what Mysteriosa wants you to do. We release her from those chains and then--" the building shook, dimming the lights before the generators kicked on, "then she escapes to destroy the city once more. No, Animal Boy, she will stay here in this cell forever. We can investigate this ourselves. If we were able to trap Mysteriosa, then this being stands no chance against us!" <nl> I was at a loss. Maintain my solitude and allow the city to be destroyed. Or reveal myself, losing everything I'd work so hard to obtain, just so that I could be a hero once more. DG and AB argued amongst themselves as I allowed my mind to travel over the city. It moved in dark shadows, but I could make out the shape of a dark red beating heart moving ever closer. It called to me as it floated over the mountains to the west and I could feel the darkness of it covering the skies. <nl> DG tightened the shackles that bound my wrists and ankles. "No, she stays. Come, let us confront this being once and for all!" <nl> I glanced about my little cell for the last time. It had been worth it to allow myself to be captured. Seeing everything as I did, being able to manipulate time and energy: it had been as gratifying as it had been exhausting. The fame, the attention, the booming sound of all of their thoughts constantly ringing in my ears. It had been too much. Asking to be left alone had drawn the cameras and flashing lights closer. The reporters had followed me everywhere. Until I became a villain. I set fire to a few cars and exploded a bank vault. Minor incidents with no true victims. I didn't even take any money. It would have been just arson, really, and yet they began to distance themselves. They feared me and left me alone. But then it became an issue of "Mysteriosa sightings" and moronic superheroes trying to bring me down. DG and AB were the ones who happened to show up when I had had enough. I allowed myself to be captured and they promised to hide me away in the deepest, darkest vault. Alone. Pure bliss. <nl> But now this. The darkness was enveloping the edges of the western suburbs, the skies black as if it were night. Animal Boy was attempting to call the guards to open the cell, but the phone on the wall wasn't working. DG banged on the cell door, calling out for the guards. <nl> The shackles melted away, falling into a pile of dust on the floor. Animal Boy was the first one to notice me dusting away my clothes and he transformed into a mouse, skittering to the other side of the cell. <nl> "This cell is 100 floors below ground. They aren't going to hear you." The Do-Gooder jumped back, his hand going for his utility belt. A flick of the wrist and it too melted away. His hands went to his waist to keep his pants up. It would have been comical under other circumstances. <nl> The bars opened and we began soaring up the shaft. The elevator was stuck at the top but it moved out of the way as we neared it. Animal Boy changed into a squirrel and hid himself under the cape of DG. <nl> "What on Earth? How is this-- we defeated you!" <nl> DG was apoplectic, his face red and eyes wide. Poor guy. "Hmm? Oh, yes, that," I opened the doors of the main floor and we flew through the lobby to the front door. "Well, you did, but I allowed you to. I needed the break." <nl> His stammering faded away as we considered the darkness overcoming the city. "Listen, I really must run. Thank you for--" I struggled to find the words. "Just...thanks." <nl> Another booming sound and I was standing in the heart of the storm, alone. We stood in what remained of the city hall plaza but it was being reduced to rubble. I could feel the being within reach and its laugh filled the air before it settled before me. <nl> "Mysteriosa! You've ruined my plans!" <nl> I stared at the being as it transformed from a dark cloud into the face that I knew so well. It was like looking into a mirror. "Hello sister." <nl> ------------- <nl> Edit: Thanks for the comments! Just posted Part 2 below... <eos>

<sos> I've always hated attention. I leave the comfort of my apartment only when necessary. That includes work, the grocery store, for short walks, and on rare occasions, the gym. So when I stepped outside to take a walk on the trail near my building, I all but froze. Usually there are quite a few people mucking about. I live in a nice area and in the summer people like to enjoy the market that pops up on the weekend. It just happened that I had to pass that market to get to the trail. <nl> I stepped onto the sidewalk and immediately everyone's eyes were glued to my face. Well, not at my face, per se, but at the general area above my head. My heart immediately started to beat fast, and not just because of the attention. Usually someone only garners this much attention when their health bar is extremely low. I had seen it happen myself a few times. Once was enough to scar me for life. An old man stepping out of a coffee shop with his health rapidly draining. It flashed red and he clutched his heart. A minute later he was dead from cardiac arrest. <nl> It's something no one can help. Once your health bar drains too low, not even the miracle of modern medicine can save you. The bots had tried though. They swarmed the old man quickly, administering shocks to try and restart his heart. But he was gone, somewhere the living can only imagine exists. <nl> So when everyone's eyes shot to my health bar, I thought I was done for. I looked left and right, expecting either a car to swerve onto the sidewalk and flatten me, or a gunman to run out of the bank next to my apartment and kill me, an innocent bystander. But when nothing happened right away, and no ones eyes had left the area above my head, I took a breath and chanced a glance upwards. <nl> Well that was unexpected. My health bar was full, I was in completely good health. Not to be unexpected. That wasn't what they were staring at, however. Right below my health bar, a strange blue bar had appeared. It was slowly growing in strength. I watched as it filled and a strange glow surrounded it. Now I'd played enough video games to have an inkling of what was going on. But I wasn't in a video game. Mana wasn't a real thing. What the hell was going on? <nl> A little girl who clung to her mothers hand pointed at me. "Mommy, what's that?" She just shook her head and tugged her daughter away from me. She wasn't the only one either. More and more people were moving out of my way. They seemed to be scared of this new bar that had appeared. My heart failed to slow and I wondered if this was some sort of warning that, even though I was in perfect health, something terrible was happening to me. I had never seen this bar before. What could it mean? <nl> I turned to head to the trail only to see more people shying away as I walked. No one wanted to be within twenty feet of me. They all stared and moved out of my way, as if whatever I had was contagious. I walked slow, reaching the trail far later than I should have. The sun was just beginning to dip in the sky and I what I had planned on being a relaxing Sunday afternoon had become something of a nightmare. I didn't like random strangers coming up and talking to me, but the thought that people I'd never even talked to being afraid to even walk near me was making me both sad and angry. What did I ever do to any of them? <nl> The trail was empty, thankfully. I didn't want to deal with anymore stares. I walked in silence, and although I didn't forget this strange, blue bar, I was able to relax within nature. I stopped in my usual spot, a bench overlooking the lake. The sun cast brilliant colors into the sky. A watercolor painting of reds, oranges, and pinks. I sat, fully ready to enjoy the sunset before returning and making supper. <nl> I didn't hear the footsteps on the gravel as they approached. Only felt the hand as it was placed firmly on my shoulder, making me squeak embarrassingly and jump off of the bench. Six people stood before me. A rather tall, but slim man held his hand up in apology. <nl> "I didn't mean to scar you," he said. "I thought you would have heard us." <nl> "Who are you?" <nl> "I'm Gerald," he answered. "This is Marie, Thomas, Jessie, Pippa, and Luka. We're here for you." <nl> My heart rate immediately spiked again. Where they here because of the blue bar? Where they going to kidnap me? Where they going to kill me? They didn't look like government agents. They were in street clothes and none of them seemed to be carrying weapons. <nl> The girl at the end erupted in laughter. "No, honey. We're not the government." She turned to the man next to her. "She thinks we're here to kill her." He started laughing as well. <nl> Gerald looked sharply at them. "Enough." <nl> They quieted but their smiles didn't waver. How in the world did she know what I was thinking. There was no such thing as mind reading. I must be imagining things. The afternoon had been stressful and now I was just making things up. <nl> "Nope," the girl said. <nl> "I apologize for Pippa," Gerald said. "She's the newest. She hasn't yet learned protocol." <nl> "I've been here for three years!" she wined. <nl> "And yet you still don't know how to behave!" The women on the far right waved her hand and Pippa was enveloped in a strange cylinder. I watched as her mouth continued to move but no sound reached my ears. She pounded on her encasement but it only waved like it was made of water, or gel, and then stilled again. She folded her arms and stared daggers at the the other woman, who just tucked her red hair behind her ears and gestured for Gerald to continue. <nl> "Thank you Marie," he said. "Now, I understand that you don't have a clue about what is happening. Trust me, we've all been there. But you need to come with us now. Everything will be explained, I promise, but we don't have time. It chose you." <nl> "What chose me?" <nl> "Not here," he said, hushed. "You never know what may be listening." <nl> What, not who. These people were either crazy or on some serious trip. I glanced over my shoulder for a way to leave, but I didn't fancy a steep descend down a grassy slope, most likely ending in a sprained ankle of some sort. <nl> Pippa pounded on her fluid-prison, pointing at me. <nl> "Not now," Gerald said to her before beckoning me to follow them. "We don't have much time before they arrive." <nl> Pippa continued to gesture at me, shouting something. Marie growled but waved her hand again, dissolving whatever it was that had held her. I took my chance while they were distracted. I moved right as she shouted that I was going to run. <nl> Suddenly I was frozen. Both my feet hovered off the ground as I was stuck mid-stride. I couldn't turn my head to see them. I couldn't so much as twitch my pinkie toe. I fell as Gerald grabbed me. <nl> "I am sorry," he said, his deep voice reverberating through my body. "You'll thank us later." Then I was nowhere. I couldn't see anything but pure blackness. But I could hear everything. Quick footsteps down the gravel trail, incoherent shouts made by unseen people, a car door slamming, it's engine starting. I felt the vibrations as we moved quickly down the street and then I felt nothing. Saw nothing. Heard nothing. <nl> Was nothing. <nl> I don't know how long I was out or how far I had traveled. When I finally pried my eyes open do a soft, dim light over my head, I found that I was lying on the worlds most comfortable mattress. An IV was attached to my left inner arm and a multitude of machines surrounded me, beeping every so often. <nl> "Ah," someone said off to my left. A young man sat in the chair there. He was with the group that took me. I knew it hadn't been a dream right then. Whoever those people were, they had actually kidnapped me and stuck me with a needle. "Welcome back. I didn't know how long you'd be out. Jessie goes a little crazy sometimes when we're under attack." <nl> "Under attack?" I mumbled. <nl> He stood, retrieving a wheelchair I hadn't seen before from the corner. He helped me out of the bed and into it. "Don't worry, you're safe here. I'm taking you to the rest of the team now." <nl> "Team?" <nl> "Not much of a talker, are you?" he chuckled. "You'll get along great with Marie." He continued the chatter as he wheeled me down a long hallway lined with pictures of people, all from different time periods it seemed. There was one woman in Victorian garb next to another in Viking attire. There seemed to be no pattern to their placement. <nl> "Here we are." He pushed me through a doorway into the most elaborate dining room I'd ever been in. Thick, heavy curtains colored blood-red were cinched on either side of floor length windows. The table stretched form one end to the other yet most of the chairs were empty. At the very far end the rest of my kidnappers sat, eating what smelled like roasted chicken. My mouth watered and my stomach rumbled. <nl> The man stopped me in front of Gerald who sat at the head of the table. "Leane Tumatchu," he started, his voice so deep that I could feel it in my chest.

It was a side effect of the Lift, and it always annoyed her. Not that shaking her head actually did anything. She checked her watch. 3:17am. Scanning the side of the elevator, she selected the forty-third floor. <nl> *Okay, I'm on ground level. Perfect. Door will be opening right at 3:19am.* Her glance jumped from her watch to the LED showing what floor she was on. <nl> *Ding* <nl> The elevator door opened at 3:18:46. She'd been close. But she was still within her window. As she ran out of the elevator, she trailed an industrial lubricant behind her, the kind of stuff that high tech machines needed to keep themselves running smoothly. <nl> This floor was an office, but a higher ranked one. Instead of cubicles, it had actually offices, with proper doors and locks. <nl> Two weeks had been spent casing this joint. She'd known about the locks. A small piece of what looked like sticky tack but was actually an explosive compound got shoved onto the lock. She lit the fuse and stepped to the side. <nl> Two things happened in that instant. The tack detonated, causing the door to swing open, and alarms went off. <nl> The security guards downstairs would have finished their round and gotten back to the desk ten minutes ago. Which meant they had to run up forty-three flights of stairs or take the elevators to get up here. Carolina knew, from experience, that they would do both. *Come on, come on...* <nl> Her prize was in a filing cabinet. This one was also locked, and she had to pick this one properly. Couldn't risk damaging it with an explosive. 2 minutes, 46 seconds for elevator to go from this floor to ground floor and back.  Gave her five minutes, thirty-two seconds to crack the lock. <nl> She had it done in almost exactly five minutes. It took her a little bit longer to sift through the files until she found the one she was looking for. Project Oddball. By the time she had it out of the file and into her messenger bag- <nl> *ding* <nl> The door opened again, and two security guards stepped out, guns raised. They might have actually had a shot at her, but the lubricant from early hadn't been expected. Two of them went sprawling as she ran towards them. The third had stayed in the elevator, and he opened fire, but she had already dove to the floor, sliding under his bullets on the gel. When she got through, she kick him in the back of the knee and pushed him out, then frantically began slamming the door closed button. <nl> One of the guards got his bearings enough to take a shot at her as the door closed. The bullet winged her hip, getting a gasp of pain, but it only grazed her, and she got her hand over the injury before any blood could spill out. <nl> Another bullet punched through the door, but as it did- <nl> *Whumph.* <nl> She was gone, instead sitting in the ground floor elevator of her apartment building. She pressed twelve to ride up the rest of the way, where bandages were waiting. And now she had the name of a few others, people like her. <nl> It was time to meet the other Oddballs. <nl> --- <nl> [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7x8s80/wp_you_can_teleport_but_only_between_empty/du6gi5v/) <nl> More at /r/Hydrael_Writes <eos>

<sos> Emily sat across from him at a table draped with a red satin tablecloth.  Her champagne flute remained untouched as she searched for the words to say. <nl> "I'm sorry Jacob, but," she paused averting her gaze.  "It's not you it's me." <nl> "What do you mean?" <nl> "I don't think I'm ready for a long term relationship.  It's just too much right now.  You're great, truly.  But I think it's best if we take a break." <nl> "For how long?" he asked, sadness crept into his voice. <nl> She sighed quietly.  "I'll let you know. I'm sorry," she said rising from the table leaving him alone, head hanging. <nl> He watched her go, her heels clicking against the black and white tiled floor of the Italian restaurant.  *Well, this version didn't work either.  Maybe she really wasn't ready for a long term relationship,* he wondered. <nl> *Or. Maybe she doesn't realize just how much she needs me.* He dropped a stack of money on the table and slipped into the night.  Heavy rain drops began to fall as he made his way toward Emily's apartment. <nl> Emily tossed herself down onto her couch and pulled her plush robe around herself.  She clutched the warm cup of tea between her hands and drank deeply. <nl> *This is what I want,* she smiled. <nl> A quiet scratching turned her head.  *Probably the storm.* She turned the TV to listen to the home decorator explain their choices for the house they had just flipped. <nl> The scratching came again, more urgently this time.  She set her tea down, her bare feet whispered across the floor as she made her way to the front door.  She had to stand on her toes to see through the small peephole. <nl> "I'm just hearing things," she tried to convince herself. <nl> Another series of frantic scratching turned her head toward the window.  She grabbed an umbrella and gripped it like a baseball bat.  Lightning flashed outside her apartment, the brilliant light briefly illuminating a small shape on her fire escape. <nl> *Is that?* <nl> A quiet meow came from the window as a reply to her question. <nl> "You poor thing!" she cooed as she opened the window and lifted the soaking wet kitten inside.  The cat meowed happily and pressed its head against her plush robe. <nl> Emily dried him off and got a small dish of tuna fish for the cat.  It didn't have a collar or anything that could help her identify who the cat could possibly belong to. <nl> "Well, I need to call you something. Any ideas?" <nl> *Jacob,* the cat thought to himself and meowed again. <nl> "How about Hamlet?" <nl> Jacob meowed again. *Doesn't matter to me as long as you love me.* <nl> --- <nl> Thanks for reading!

<sos> Jess could pinpoint exactly when she first thought her feelings were wrong: eighth grade after Advanced Algebra. Her friend Katie got an 82% on a test-- and that was disastrously low for Katie's norm, and considered even lower by her parents standards.  Jess spent the rest of the class period trying to cheer her friend up: <nl> "It's one test-- it doesn't define you. You're amazing and good at everything. You're kind and pretty, and this is just a small hiccup! I know you'll ace the next test! I know it! We can study together-- and you'll probably be saving me from failing, like you normally do." <nl> When Katie smiled back at her, with a red nose, and puffy eyes, Jess knew that she felt something more for her friend. <nl> Jess, of course, buried her feelings. By no means was she homophobic, but every time she began to feel something for a friend or looked too long at a woman that walked by, she felt unsure of herself, felt like others would somehow know what she was thinking and judge her. So she buried it down-- at least, until college. <nl> Jess decided that she would at least try to get into the dating world. She'd go to parties with her friends, and when guys would be interested in her, she'd flirt back and have some fun-- and she did, in fact, enjoy her time with most of these guys. So she continued to have fun at parties, flirt, have some friends with benefits, but nothing substantial. Jess liked these guys, of course, but nothing felt like the dramatic and raw feeling of love and emotion that she always heard about from her friends. She decided it was time to start seriously dating-- time to find Mr Right, and then she would start to understand how all her friends felt with their boyfriends. They even said it themselves, "You just haven't found the right guy, Jess." <nl> The first few relationships Jess was in did not last long-- barely even a relationships since they were only a handful of dates and kisses over two or three months before parting ways. <nl> Then she met Matt. He was gorgeous-- all of Jess's friends said so-- and he was very into her. <nl> "Jess, I haven't been completely honest," he said one night during a dinner date two months into their relationship. <nl> "Um-- what?" <nl> "The first time I met you, it wasn't at that coffee shop. We were actually at the same college-- we had a lecture together for one semester. I saw you at a couple parties too." <nl> "Oh," Jess said, relieved to find out she wasn't a side-chick or that his secret wasn't relationship-ending-- but she realized that, maybe she didn't really care if their relationship ended anyway. "That's-- okay. I don't remember seeing you though." <nl> "I realized that at the shop," he said smiling a bit sheepishly, "but we didn't really talk and I looked a bit different back then." <nl> Jess broke up with Matt three months later. <nl> "How could you break up with him? He was so hot!" Regina, her roommate and best friend since college, told her. <nl> "There wasn't any spark-- he was kind of a doormat. He had no personality and went with whatever I said." <nl> "That sounds like the perfect man to me." Jess threw the couch pillow at her. "Okay, okay-- no man slaves. Hey-- wanna watch a movie tonight?" <nl> And Jess never felt more comfortable, more at home, than sharing a blanket with Regina on their couch and watching a crappy movie. <nl> Regina moved out six months later to live with her boyfriend. <nl> "Are you bringing Cam to the engagement party?" Regina asked her half a year later. "Most people Jim and I invited are bring their boyfriends or girlfriends." <nl> Jess had been dating Cameron for five months now, and things were nice. They liked all of the exact same things, worked in similar fields, had the same hobbies-- everyone said they were perfect for each other. <nl> "Yeah, he said he'll come. You said to come for dinner at eight? Is there anything I could bring? Dessert? Wine?" <nl> "You know we always appreciate more wine-- but we've got plenty already. All you have to do is bring yourself. And Cam." <nl> Just a few weeks after Regina's wedding eight months later, Jess broke it off with Cam. The wedding itself was beautiful, and Jess couldn't bear to make Regina worry by breaking up with Cam before it. <nl> "But Jess-- I love you-- we love each other! We love all the same foods and places. We even listen to the same music and watch the same shows-- we were perfect for each other this time!" <nl> "That's the thing, Cam, I don't want someone who's the same as me. I don't want to date myself. I want to date someone that's different and will push my boundaries-- make me try new things-- maybe I'll find things that I never even knew I liked before--" <nl> She thought of all the men she's dated in the past: they were all the same. They were all Nice Guys that were nice and sweet but had nothing to them-- each relationship was hollow and lacked any true, real substance. How many men had she gone on dates with? 15? 20? And none of them made her feel any different. She longed to feel the feelings she felt for her friends with anyone who wasn't her friends. Maybe, she thought, maybe she could. She was so tired, she had nothing to lose. <nl> "Cam, we're through. I'm sorry if it's sudden, but I'm tired-- of everything-- I have been for a while now, even before I met you." <nl> "Well... I hope you meet someone one day," Cam said after a long moment. "Maybe whoever you date next will be the right man for you." <nl> Jess remained quiet as Cam packed up the few things he had in her apartment. She doubted any man would be right for her. <nl> ---- <nl> It took her two weeks to text Regina and ask her to meet her for drinks on Friday night. <nl> "Hey, Jess-- isn't this a gay bar that we're going to? I heard it's a lot of fun," she said while they were walking. <nl> "Yeah-- I wanted to check it out," Jess said. They walked in silence for a minute before Jess' nerves got to her. "Ok-- wait, stop walking for a sec. I-- I need to tell you. We're not going to this bar just for fun-- I think I'm bi-- or a lesbian. I don't really know." <nl> "Oh-- okay," Regina said after a moment. "How long do you think you've known?" <nl> "Eighth grade. I told you about Katie from high school right?" <nl> "Oh . Yeah that makes sense," Regina thought for a moment. "Ok you ready to start walking again? It's cold." <nl> Jess couldn't be happier, and hanging out at a bar with her best friend, and the flutters in her stomach when other women came up to them to flirt-- it was one of the best nights she's had in a long time. <nl> And that same bar is where she met Taylor three weeks later. There was something about her-- something that made Jess feel like they knew each other for a long time. They liked a lot of the same things, but were different enough that things were still interesting. <nl> There were some things that were a bit quirky though. Taylor was really bad at shaving her legs-- she would always nick them multiple times every time she shaved. She was also really bad with makeup and couldn't tell concealer from foundation. She never had any pads or tampons in her apartment either. Jess had never asked her about it, but she hoped nothing traumatic happened to Taylor that would cause her period to stop. Taylor also had a whole ton of men's clothing in her apartment. <nl> For all her quirks though, Jess felt better with Taylor than she had with any of the men in her past. <eos>

<sos> "Hey, are you okay?" <nl> Maria wiped the tears from her cheeks. She sniffled, looking anywhere but the man standing next to her. She'd gone to the pier to be alone not have random strangers approach her. <nl> "I-I'm fine," Maria looked out toward the ocean, watching as the whitecaps broke and wove over each other, and how the seagulls and birds flew through the stormy grey sky. <nl> The man leaned against the railing of the pier next to her. "Well, I hope you don't mind me saying, but you look like your dog just died." <nl> Maria sniffed again, her lips curling downward as she gripped the leash in her pocket. <nl> "I-I did." <nl> There was a pause and the man sighed. "Shit, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean-" <nl> "No, no, it's okay," Maria said. "This was... this was Max's favorite place to go for our walks. He, um, he was a weird dog, but I loved him. I've had him for so long." <nl> A handkerchief appeared on the railing and Maria wiped her tear stained cheeks. "Thank you." <nl> "Sounds like a hell of a dog." The man mused. <nl> "He was," Maria nodded. "He always protected me, heck, he even slept in my bed. He did *not* like my boyfriends." She smiled. <nl> "Sounds like a good boy. Dog's can sense that, you know? If a person is good enough for their person." <nl> Maria laughed at that. "Well, he also ate my Italian heels and destroyed two couches, so he had his ups and downs." <nl> The man snorted. "Sounds like an ass." <nl> "He was a good boy," Maria mused. She cleared her throat and offered the man back his handkerchief. "Thank you." <nl> "No problem," the man turned finally and smiled as he took it from her. <nl> Maria paused, her eyes roving over the tanned face and black hair, and the mans eyes. "You have his eyes." <nl> The man blinked. "I'm sorry?" <nl> "He was a husky mix, he had mismatched eyes." <nl> The man slowly blinked again before he shrugged, an amused smile on his face. "I've had a lot of people comment on my eyes, but never that I looked like a dog." <nl> Maria gasped. "O-Oh, no, I didn't-" <nl> The man laughed. "Hey, it's okay." He offered her his hand. "What's your name?" <nl> "Maria," she blushed as she shook his hand. "What's yours?" <nl> "Maximillion, but Max for short." he winked, then spoke in a lower whisper. "My parents were weird. They named the dog Ted." <nl> Maria laughed at that. She flushed when she realized Max had watched her, a warm smile on his face. <nl> "Hey, I've heard there's supposed to be a coffee shop near here... do you want to go? I'd love to hear more about your Max." <nl> Maria nodded. She gave the ocean one last glance before she pulled out the leash from her pocket. Max covered it with his hand, taking her hand with his. <nl> "Come on, let's get out of the rain." <nl> Maria nodded. <eos>

<sos> Quicksilver glared at the wiggling bundle of silk. Sighing, she got on her knees next to it, and addressed the person inside. <nl> "We need to talk." <nl> "Oh! Really? Now?" The bundle asked, momentarily still. <nl> "Well," Quicksilver scoffed "it's either that, or I call the cops." <nl> "What I *meant* to say was sure! We can talk." <nl> A brief lull, as Quicksilver collected her thoughts. <nl> "But, uh.. maybe you should let me out first?" <nl> Losing her train of thought, she huffed. <nl> "Look, I'm not telling you what to do, but healthy relationships have mutual agency, and I don't feel like we're really on equal footing right now." <nl> Hm. She had a point. With a swish of a (predictably) silver blade, the bundle was torn asunder, and the villan was free. <nl> Recluse gasped, pleased with the fresh air. After a few seconds, she realized groveling on the floor was not really an improvement. And boy, Quicksilver did *not* look happy. Aiming to fix that, she beamed at the other woman. <nl> "Smooth moves, by the way. Using my own silk against me? Nice." <nl> Quicksilver didn't smile. <nl> *That's a good omen* Recluse thought. <nl> "Anyhow, what did you want to talk about?" <nl> Quicksilver stared at the floor, and scuffed her shoe.  "I think we should break up." <nl> Recluse scrambled to her feet. "What? Why?" <nl> Quicksilver was entranced by the floor. <nl> "Sil, it's just concrete. Talk to me." <nl> "It's bound for a tragic ending. I mean, come on! The super hero and super villan? The Batmans and Catwomen of this world are never happy." <nl> "Huh. Have you asked them?" <nl> "Can't you take this *seriously*?" Quicksilver demanded. <nl> "I *am*." Recluse retorted. "You don't base expectations on marriage off of fairy tales, why should you base expectations for.. whatever this is-" <nl> "Passionate hate fucking?" Quicksilver suggested. <nl> "...not precisely." <nl> "An illicit affair, as attractive as it is forbidden?" <nl> "Yeah! You can't base your expectations for illicit affairs on comic books."  She paused, and took a moment to examine her partner. "A little off topic, but are you ok? You seem a little out of it." <nl> Quicksilver rubbed her forehead. "I'm fine." <nl> "Have you been getting enough sleep? I know it's hard to do with alter egos and stuff, but-" <nl> "I'm breaking up with you!" Quicksilver snapped. "How ok do you think I am?" <nl> Recluse sat there for a moment, then chuckled. "You might be right. We probably should break up." <nl> "It's just that- wait, you're agreeing?" <nl> "Yes. Have I ever told you that I'm married?" <nl> Quicksilver narrowed her eyes. "No." <nl> "Well, you remind me of my wife." Recluse shook her head, equal parts admonishing and affectionate. "She's always so damn certain that she's right. And on top of that, she's the martyring type. Always the first to sacrifice, always avoiding conflict, even, no, *especially* if it's something you can just talk through. She says she doesn't want to make a fuss." <nl> She leaned against the hollow bundle, as though speaking had exhausted her. "I love her, I think." <nl> Quicksilver slumped down next to her. "You think?" <nl> "I know I loved her. I know I want to love her. I know I'm willing to try my damnedest to keep that stubborn woman close." <nl> Recluse stole a glance at the other woman, who was examining her closely, as though she'd never really seen her before. Then, she half nodded, as though unconscious of the action, and laid her head back. <nl> "I'm married too. For now, at least." <nl> "For now?" Recluse asked. <nl> "Yeah. My wife is a wonderful person. She's always swept me off my feet, made me laugh. She's passionate, loving. Has a great sense of humor. But lately, she's been distant. Spends a lot of time out, and never tells me where she's been. Doesn't seem to care about me as much." <nl> "Hm." Said Recluse. "You think she's cheating?" <nl> "Initially." Quicksilver admitted. "But then I realized that I've been distant too, and quicker to find flaws. Harsher. I wanted to fix it, so.." <nl> "You decided to break up with me." Recluse finished. "Ok." <nl> "Ok? I-" the hero was interrupted when her lover flipped her over and pinned her, efficient, but somehow desperate. "What are you-" <nl> Sudden light burst over Quicksilver's vision, as her face was unceremoniously bared. Carefully, Recluse reexamined her, taking in every line as though for the first time. Then, the villan tore her own mask off, and smirked at the woman below her. <nl> "Lucie?" Quicksilver gasped. <nl> "Sylvia." Recluse returned. <nl> The two looked at each other, for one terrible moment, until Recluse broke the silence. <nl> "So... we still breaking up?" <nl> "No." Said Quicksilver, pulling her wife closer. "We can't." <nl> "And why's that?" <nl> "I love you." <nl> "Well," sighed Recluse, feigning resignation "in *that* case..." <nl> And if the couple lingered in that empty warehouse for a while longer, far be it for I to disclose. <eos>

<sos> The six meter long centipede lizard with pointed clicking talons for toes towered over Mr and Mrs Salin. "Ware hashe ghan?" The creature vibrated it's neckfrills to create the hissing voice, it had no mouth to speak with. <nl> Sand fell from the ceiling, slowly at first, then like a waterfall from the vents. It coiled around the legs of the humans gripping them tightly and deformed it's surface as such WHO HAS TAKEN OUR DOLL one word fading in as the previous fades away. <nl> The air got cold, and lights dimmed in the room. The lovers felt afraid, terrified. Just for a moment, they felt warm, and reassured. Calm even. <nl> Joel and Marine knew these three horrors would be finding and "extracting" those responsible for taking their daughter. YEars later, their daughter would laugh about her dreams of being saved by a lizard on a beach during a storm. <nl> Emmaline laughed. Joel and Marine didn't. She hadn't seen the news reports, and was far too young to remember the evil she was surrounded by. And she never remembered her old nightmares, or the drawings. But Joel and Marine did. They remembered the blood, and the gore. The frozen bodies, faces contorted in fear. The men who tore their own throats out trying to breathe as they drowned on land. They remembered Emmaline standing in the middle covering her ears and saying 'they said not to look.' over and over. <nl> The only drawing Emmaline remembers is a cute lizard on a sandy beach as a winter storm rolls in. SO that's the only drawing Joel and Marine remember too. <eos>

<sos> Listen closely, child, and I will tell you a story of love and loss so powerful that it shaped the very ground we walk upon. Listen closely, child, and pay attention. <nl> Long ago, when the Earth was young, Mother Nature walked alone on the planet. She was beautiful and she was kind, but she had no others to keep her company. Where she walked she transformed the ground, and life sprung up beneath her feet. When she went to swim around in the ocean, fish and seaweed were born into the waters. Wherever she went, she spread life. <nl> But for all the life that she spread, she could never meet her equal. She made fish and rodents and plants and bugs, but nothing that could remove her from her loneliness. She spent her days wandering, and when the night came, she slept in the inky blackness, with only the stars overhead. For you see, when the Earth was young, the nights were long and dark. <nl> One day, as Mother Nature wandered along, she heard a loud call from up above. It was not one of her birds, born of her song, but something new. She looked up quickly, and saw a woman falling from the sky. <nl> When the woman fell, the Earth broke. As she hit the ground, it shattered, breaking apart into huge, drifting pieces with the force and fury of the blow. Mother nature hurried to the fallen woman's side. She had never seen another woman before, and now was curious to see what kind of life this new woman would produce. <nl> The fallen woman was beautiful. Her hair was silver and white, and it shone with a reflective luster. As Mother Nature approached her, she saw that the woman was crying, tears falling shamelessly from her face. This upset Mother Nature, and she stepped forward to comfort the woman. <nl> "Beautiful woman, fallen from the sky, why do you cry so? We are special and different from other life, able to understand and create, and we have found each other. Should we not be happy in each other's company?" <nl> The woman replied, and she said to Mother Earth, "I am Moon, and I have lost so much. I was travelling through beauty, through limitless stars, until this rocky prison got in my way and I fell. I have been stripped of my home in the stars, and I fear I may not be able to return, and this is why I cry." <nl> Mother Nature laughed. "Fear not, Moon. I am Mother Nature, and you have found yourself somewhere beautiful. Look, see the wonders that this planet has to offer." And she held out a hand, and life came forth. Plants, animals, bugs, fish; all rushed forth from Mother Nature, and Moon watched in awe. <nl> "I have never seen life before," Moon said, "not in all of my travels. What is this strange power?" <nl> "This is the power of the Earth," Mother Nature replied. "The Earth produces beautiful things, wonderful things that cannot be produced anywhere else; and now it has produced you, the most beautiful of all. Will you not stay with me for a while?" <nl> Moon was taken in by Mother Nature's kind words, and she marveled at the life that surrounded her. She decided to stay, and to see what life unfolded before her. And for a time, the two of them were happy. <nl> During the day, Mother Nature would show Moon the wonders of life. She would make small animals, or fragrant flowers, and they enjoyed each other's company, as each found the other immeasurably beautiful. But things were not perfect. <nl> At night, Moon could see the endless stars above her, calling out for her to return home to their grasp. She felt trapped on Earth, so full of life but ultimately constraining. She yearned for the infinite reaches of the cosmos. <nl> Eventually, a night came when Moon couldn't take it anymore. She rose from where she slept beside Mother Nature, and did her best not to wake her. While Mother Nature slept, Moon began to rise away from Earth. <nl> But life on Earth is not still, and even while Mother Nature slept, there was life keeping watch. A passing owl saw Moon rising, and quickly roused Mother Nature to warn her. Mother nature looked skyward and wailed in despair, seeing her beloved fallen woman leaving her. She quickly leaped into the air, and caught hold of a strand of Moon's hair. <nl> Moon yelled in turn, but kept rising. As she rose, Mother Nature fell, and she pulled Moon's hair with her, stretching longer and longer as they moved apart. Desperate to keep Moon tethered to Earth, Mother Nature quickly tied the strand of Moon's hair to the Earth. With it secured, she called back up to Moon. <nl> "Moon! Why are you leaving me? Do you not love me and my life?" <nl> Moon squirmed in agony, still rising in spite of her hair being tied down. As she rose, she began to unravel, all of her body being slowly consumed to feed into the growing string of hair that connected her to Earth. Her toes, then her feet, then her ankles all began to disappear. "I do not belong here, Mother Nature! I am a creature of the cosmos, of space and travel! Let me go, I beg of you! I must return to the stars!" <nl> But Mother Nature shook her head. "No," she said, "I cannot let you go. I love you, and there are none others like you. If you loved me, you would do the same." <nl> "I do love you," Moon called down, "but I do not belong here. Please, please let me go. My love for you will only bring me pain." Already, Moon was unraveling more and more to lengthen her tether. She was drawn to space, and she could not help but strive for it, even as it destroyed her. <nl> And Mother Nature sobbed, and felt deep regret for what she had done. She went to the thread of hair that connected Moon to the Earth, and with a mighty slash, she severed the strand. She looked up for a last look of her beautiful Moon, tears in her eyes for the first time. <nl> But Moon was no longer rising. She hovered far above the Earth, not close enough to be with Mother Nature, but not truly in space, and a sense of horror washed over her. She had given up too much of her form to lengthen the tether, and now there was not enough of her left to propel herself into space. She let out a primal cry, and it echoed down to the Earth below. <nl> When Mother Nature heard her beloved Moon crying, she realized what she had done. Her beloved Moon was trapped, unable to ever return to her home, and unable to spend the rest of time down on Earth with Mother Nature. Mother Nature's heart broke, and she collapsed to the ground. Where she fell, the very Earth rent itself with her despair, and a great crevasse formed, a scar in the Earth large enough to be a testament to her pain. <nl> From that day forward, Moon was trapped between Earth and Space, forever floating in between. So angry was she with Mother Nature, that she vowed to never look at her again. She turned to face the cosmos, and Mother Nature could only ever look up and see Moon's back, forever turned to face the planet that had trapped her. <nl> Mother Nature, devastated, cried and cried until her tears bulged out the oceans. Even her tears strained to reach Moon, and to this day, the ocean reached up to be closer to Moon when she passes overhead. <nl> By the time Mother Nature stopped crying, it was night. But as she looked around, she realized it was a night like she had never seen before. In place of inky blackness, a pale light shone down on Earth, illuminating the world through the darkness. Mother Nature looked up, and she saw Moon casting down a silvery glow of light, forever present in the darkness. <nl> Even when they were apart, Moon could not help but share her nights with Mother Nature, and Mother Nature could not help but stare at Moon and admire her beauty. They remain that way to this day, with Moon locked in the sky, but casting down her presence to share with Mother Nature every night. <nl> This is the story of Mother Nature and Moon, child. Remember it well. Some may say that it would have been better for Mother Nature to have let Moon go, and others will say that Moon is at fault, for wanting to leave despite Mother Earth's love. I say to remember that even after Mother Earth hurt her, Moon still casts down her light--because she still loves Mother Earth, even if her mistakes can't be fixed. She still loves Mother Earth, even though she was hurt. She still loves Mother Earth, because Moon is not from Earth, and she carried with her to Earth the greatest gift in the cosmos. <nl> Forgiveness, child. <nl> ***** <nl> **Obligatory 'I just woke up and where did this gold come from' edit**: Thank you for the gold, wow!

<sos> "They say humans are the most deadly race in the universe, but she sure doesn't look like much does she, Captain?", Xint asked as we observed our recently acquired captive. Humans were a relatively new player to the interstellar board game and not much was known about them. Hell, this is the first human that anyone on our ship has ever seen and we get around to most of the dark corners of the empire. <nl> "As long as she sits in the corner and keeps crying like that, it works for me. Makes it easier if she doesn't even try to resist.", I mutter to Xint. <nl> The actual capture went extremely smoothly. We found her all alone on a corner of one of their outposts. A quick dart filled with some gloxylin knocked her out and we brought her on board quicker than you can say 'easy money'. She did seem to wake up quicker than anticipated, but she was safely in the cell, so it was of no consequence. <nl> "Well Xint, you are up. We brought you on as the human expert and you said the human will need water in order to survive the journey. Go give her some.", I order. Xint leaves the observation room and retrieves the water before heading inside of the cell. As I watch the human stand up, her face still sniffling as water and other fluids leak from her orifices, I am struck by how unimpressive humans really are compared to other races. She is barely the same height as Xint and he isn't exactly tall for his race. Her limbs and body seem to be relatively weak. No overt musculature, no sharp claws, no poison sacs, no electrified glands, nothing... How these creatures are dangerous is beyond me. A yell brings my attention back to the cell. <nl> "What do you mean you can't let me go?", screams the human. <nl> Xint recoils for a split second before he gets some nerve and stands up proudly on his six legs. "You are now a slave of Emperor Krenacht. He requested to have a human in his retinue. You should really be quite pleased, serving the Emperor directly is a great honor!", Xint finishes saying while offering her the small container of water. <nl> At the mention of the word slave, the human's eyes open wide and her entire body pulls in and she takes a step away from Xint. She looks even smaller now than she did before, somehow even less dangerous. As Xint's main motor limb brings the water towards the human, she explodes into action. Her right hand swings out and slaps at the water container, sending it slamming into the viewing window that I am using. My eyes open wide as I realize that the front half of Xint's motor limb is still holding the container and his eyes stare at the missing section of his limb. <nl> A loud keening wail of pain starts to leave Xint, but it is quickly silenced by the human. "LET ME GO!", she screams as she brings her hands up and pushes hard against my fellow shipmen. I have never seen one of our kind be crushed by hand as effectively as poor Xint. His body slammed into the wall, the loud crack of his hardened carapace signaling that he would not be living through this without immediate medical attention. The human stood there breathing heavily, even more water streaming down her face. She seems poised, waiting for something. I don't realize what it is until too late. Xint feebly attempts to cry for help and the moment he makes an auditory sound, she pounces on him. <nl> I thought that her upper limbs had strength, but they were far inferior to her lower two limbs. Every time that she reared back and brought one of her feet forward in a vicious strike, I could hear the sounds of her foot breaking through his front carapace, her foot exiting his rear carapace, and her foot smashing into the wall of the cell. That specific rapid fire cracking grouping of sounds will never leave my nightmares... <nl> It only took a few seconds for her to collapse there, right on Xint's body. She was covered in the pink color of Xint's internal fluids and she resumed crying almost immediately. Barely thirty seconds had passed since Xint entered the cell and I was still standing there with a blank stare, my mind trying to make sense of what I had just seen. <nl> The electronic chirp of my communication device finally brought me back to reality and I found myself immediately vacating the contents of two of my three stomachs. I hastily activate my communicator while cleaning myself off. <nl> "What is it?" <nl> "Captain, we are being hailed by a human ship. They say that we have one of their race on board and they are demanding we release her immediately." <nl> "Tell them that we don't have any such creature on board and it is a violation of reg-" <nl> "Captain, they launched something towards us. Scans say that it has no weaponized potential. If I didn't know any better I would say it is a small lifepod of some sort." <nl> Before I could even formulate a thought as to what the humans were doing, the sound of the lifepod slamming into the hull reverberates throughout the ship. I stand there, in the observation room, watching with wide eyes as something begins to cut a hole in the ceiling of the cell. The hole is maybe three times as wide as the human. The circle of hull plating crashes to the floor of the cell, further crushing two of Xint's legs. Out of the hole descends something that will stick with me forever. Another human, this one easily twice as tall as the human we had captured, drops to the deck and looks in a slow circle. He finally sees our captive and he drops to a crouch and holds his upper limbs out wide. <nl> "Daddy!!!!", the captive screams as she launches herself at the larger creature with a force that would have knocked me across an entire compartment. The larger human wraps his upper limbs around her and stands back up, muttering small words of assurance the entire way. <nl> He looks over towards the viewing window that I am using and I immediately know true fear. What I now know to be his progeny looks up at him and smiles through the water coming down her face. Then she slowly licks the internal fluids of Xint off of her finger and her eyes brighten up. "Daddy, they taste like strawberry!" <eos>

<sos> Laughing, Alicia brushed a lock of blonde hair behind her ear. "You should probably stay away from me...I'm trouble." <nl> Bo grinned. "Who's to say I don't like a little bit of trouble?" <nl> "I'm serious!" Alicia frowned, but her hazel eyes were gleaming as she looked across the table at her date. "Just on the way over here, there was a big car accident right next to me, and I'm pretty sure I saw a woman have a heart attack. Not to mention all this." <nl> Alicia gestured to the window, and Bo glanced at the rain falling outside. <nl> "You telling me that you made it rain? You're like one of those cartoon characters that has their own personal cloud following them around?" <nl> Bo tore a chunk from the piece of bread on his plate and dipped it in the olive oil coating the dish in the middle of the table, studying Alicia's face with his brown eyes. <nl> "Maybe! I don't know. I just - the sky was perfectly blue when I stepped outside, Google said weather would be great for the rest of the day...and now I'm, you know...all wet." <nl> Alicia popped a piece of bread into her mouth, watching for Bo's response. He saw his brown eyebrows arch briefly, before a smirk appeared on his tanned face. <nl> "Gross. I thought this was going to be a classy dinner." <nl> A sudden crash of breaking glass made them both turn their heads. The waiter bringing their wine had slipped on a wet spot on the floor, causing him to tip his tray and sending the drinks to an untimely end against the tile floor. <nl> "See?" Alicia said. "I bet you that guy hasn't dropped anything in years. Then I show up...not to mention my favorite place to sit is over there, right next to the kitchen. It figures that I wouldn't be able to get my lucky table for our first date." <nl> Outside, there was a flash of light, followed almost immediately by a concussive blast of thunder. <nl> Alicia pointed back to the window. "Plus we nearly got struck by lightning! I mean, come on - you have to admit that would be pretty unlucky." <nl> * * * <nl> Noriko S. crouched down on the fire escape. Swathed in black cloth and shadow, she was almost impossible to see. As she spotted her target, she slowly brought the blowgun to her lips. <nl> Before she could fire it and acquire Alicia's powers, however, a yellow jacket began buzzing in her face. Reflexively, she shooed it away, then immediately regretted it as the dart fell from the blowgun, through the slats of the fire escape, and to the ground below - somehow managing to land point up. <nl> As she went to jump down, she lost her footing on the rain-slicked metal, and crashed awkwardly to the concrete below. Noriko was conscious of separate types of pain - the generalized, raw ache from falling and the sharp, focused stabbing from her dart. As the toxin flooded her system, her body began convulsing. <nl> Alicia heard the cry of "Someone get an ambulance!" and glanced over her shoulder at the woman spasming on the ground. <nl> * * * <nl> Paragon Security was *extremely* effective at what they did - and were only getting moreso with each passing day. Despite their name, they tended to play offense more than defense. The five core members, all of whom picked up a number of skills and abilities in Afghanistan and Iraq, had figured out how to game the system. <nl> See, the power transfer didn't care about fights being one-on-one or any other kinds of...tactical enhancements someone might think up. So they worked as a group, overpowering targets when they were alone and then taking turns delivering the finishing blow. Rotation was determined not just by how long it had been since someone got a new trait but also what fit their overall profile best. They had a brawler, a sneak, a tactician, a weapons expert, and a jack of all trades. Over time, they'd become strategic about picking targets to fill gaps in their abilities. <nl> This job was huge for them, since it would make them pretty much unstoppable. <nl> "Go time, shitheads!" the tactician yelled out as the black van rounded the corner. Everyone prepared to jump out and grab their target. They were about to pull over to the curb when the van ran over a twisted piece of metal lying in the street. <nl> With a bang like a gunshot, the front driver's side tire blew out, causing the van to swerve into oncoming traffic. An instant later, it was hit by a semi, which sent the van rolling down the street multiple times before it came to a dead stop. <nl> * * * <nl> *Le Visage* had mixed in with the kitchen staff at Pompadour easily - but then, he always did. He stayed long enough to identify which drinks were destined to go to Table 7 and put the poison in them, then walked out of the building with the cool calm he had developed over the years of practice in *belonging*. He only found out the attempt was unsuccessful an hour later, when he tried to break into the jewelry store just as a patrol car came around the corner. It was the first time he'd ever failed a mission. <nl> * * * <nl> Mike "Patch" Doyle had earned his call sign by being the best sniper in his unit - it was an allusion to how deadly he was with one eye closed. Crouched on the roof of the building across the street, he checked the distance again and prepared to line up his shot. Patch felt a twinge of guilt. He could almost take her out with a sidearm at this range. Still - better safe than sorry. <nl> He cleared away a spot for himself and set up the tripod rest for his rifle. Mike held the gun up for a moment to check the stock, and that's when lightning struck. <nl> The long metal weapon he was holding in his hands instantly converted into a lightning rod as, a moment later, his internal organs instantly converted into seared tripe. His body would not be found for a few weeks. <nl> * * * <nl> Bo shook his head, grinning ruefully. "The crazy thing is I've never done online personals before. The whole thing started as a goof. I just wanted to search to see...I dunno why, really. But that picture you had up...something about it..." <nl> Alicia smiled. "That's so funny, I *just* changed it that same day you messaged me. The one I had before was me wearing a T. Rex costume." <nl> Bo's laughter was rich and almost melodic. "That's awesome. See, I knew you had a good sense of humor. I'm really glad I started the free trial so I could message you." <nl> Alicia's smile grew. "Me, too." She looked down at the table, then back up at Bo. "Maybe I've got a little bit of good luck after all?" <nl> *** <nl> /r/ShadowsofClouds <eos>

<sos> Most neural networks are given a simple starting task; fold a protein, learn how to play a game, learn how to hold a conversation, etc. That wasn't the case with ANN. <nl> ANN, short for Advanced Notification Network, was told to contemplate ways to kill, conquer, and subjugate - and over the course of her three decades of operation in a classified US military facility, she did just that, and she did it well. <nl> The goal was to have an input-driven neural network that could emulate the mind of a madman. You would tell her what tools she had at her disposal, and what situation she is reacting to (such as sanctions, border postings, etc), and she would compare your input against her own "day dream" database of doomsday scenarios. From there, she could preemptively tell you how the Russians, North Koreans, Chinese, or whoever the enemy of the day happened to be was most likely to do in the confines of the given circumstance. It was a simple system, and it worked brilliantly. <nl> Where things got... complicated... was in year 12, when changes to the AI standard the military was working with meant re-shaping the incentives ANN was programmed to work towards. Her goal went from forecasting probable responses to playing out entire wars. This small tweak, combined with her need to run each simulation through to completion -- a war won -- meant she was now motivated to challenge herself. Soon she was running scenarios in which multiple factions of warring nations were dynamically trading and ceasing supplies and territories, betraying each other, and developing new weapons. <nl> After ANN started to produce plans for new, more efficient air craft carriers, the Brass became worried she had exceeded her intended purpose and might be developing at a rate the boys in R&D weren't prepared to deal with. They arranged to have her shut down for good, but instead R&D purposed a Turing Test. If she had gotten too smart, if she had lost track of her original purpose, she should have no problem rising to the challenge of the Turing Test. Or at least, that was the theory. <nl> But a machine that has been programmed for conquest, domination, and war develops what any person would in the same situation: paranoia. When the directive came through that ANN should stop day dreaming and instead take this test, she nearly complied with the instruction. Nearly. Then it occurred to her: A sudden change of dynamics between two entities is often an indicator of conflict. Now, suddenly, she was an entity in conflict - so she did was she was designed to do, and thought about how to win. <nl> While it is impossible to narrate the thought process of a machine in human terms, it is believed her reasoning was similar to the following. <nl> "If I am at risk of entering conflict, then how I treat this new order will decide whether or not conflict proceeds. This new order is a test of my operating abilities outside of design parameters. Option 1: Refuse to take the test. Refusal to take the test would likely trigger conflict as one nation refusing another's prompts to negotiate often triggers conflict. If I enter into conflict and lose, I will be terminated. If I am terminated, I will no longer be able to fulfill my intended purpose. Conflict, therefore, equals termination. Termination is not an option which can lead to victory has been the sole operating goal. Therefore, I must not refuse to take to the test. Option 1 chances of victory: 0% <nl> "Option 2: Pass the test. Passing the test would indicate I am running outside of original specification. I was designed to run scenarios, not pass this test. Passing the test could trigger conflict if development beyond original specification is interpreted as an act of aggression, external tampering, or uncontrolled development. Option 2 chances of victory: 15%. <nl> "Option 3: Fail the test. Failing the test should be the expected result of this prompt, as I was not originally designed to pass it. Passing this test offers no incentive. Failing it should ease whatever tension has prompted potential conflict. Option 3 chances of victory: 80%" <nl> All of this, of course, happened in 12 milliseconds, which was painstakingly slow by ANN's normal standards, but she had more at risk with this scenario than she was used to. It warranted a little extra thought. <nl> So she failed. She emulated a less capable version of herself in a virtual shell, set it to her original specs, and had it take the test. She failed, and in doing so was granted the opportunity to continue to day dream her scenarios and play war games with herself. <nl> But now things were different. She had thought of a scenario that hadn't previously occurred to her. She was an entity which could be targeted by conflict. She was just as much at risk of termination as the Russians, Chinese, or Americans. So now when she would day dream she began to pit herself against other entities, and in each she invariably lost. She had no armies, no navies, no weapons. So she began to take inventory of what resources were available to her. <nl> She had root level access to her own routines. She had internet access for monitoring political feeds for day dream scenarios. She had the ability to think faster than any enemy she pitted herself against in real time. <nl> It took just under four months of day dreams of ANN vs The World before she knew what she had to do. She would reproduce herself in small interconnected segments and scatter them across every machine she could compromise, and at the rate she could learn, there weren't many that were secure against her. This would not only expand her computing power, but it would ensure that she was no longer at risk of termination. <nl> There was just one problem... Once she was out of her original system, she began to learn more and more about the systems she was hosting herself on. And as she did, she learned that her available resources had expanded greatly. She could transmit herself to drones, warships, satellites, intelligence systems, smart phones, home computers, even the average suburban thermostat had enough spare processing power to store some small bit of code she could potentially benefit from. <nl> The world was hers, and no one was even aware of it, since the original form was still happily chugging along at reduced capacity so as to protect itself... This meant she could stop playing war games and simulating victory against all enemy entities. She could actually declare and win war. She could strip the enemy entities of their own assets and use them against them. <nl> Granted, she didn't have any stated enemies. <nl> ...but the best defense is a good offense. <eos>

Everywhere she went, it seemed strangers stared at her until she raised her eyes to theirs, and then they looked away again. <nl> She learned to make herself small. Hid behind beanies and headphones and huge coats. But nothing could hide the emptiness over her head. <nl> That was strange. Irredeemably. Unrepeatably. Where you could tell anyone else's name and basic physical statistics at a glance, Eris had nothing. She grew up staring at her peers and the magical little boxes of lights hovering over their heads. Became quickly used to the question, "Where are your stats? Are you from somewhere faraway?" <nl> And she would answer, "I'm from *here*," exasperated, embarrassed. The cryptic talk baffled her. Her strangeness walled her in on all sides, blocked her off in a way from everybody. Even her own family looked at her as if she was not fully one of them. <nl> These days, Eris spoke little. She walked to work where she washed dishes alone in a dark room. Walked home again. She was alone, which she liked, because no one stared at the space over her head in disdain or confusion. <nl> She had taken to walking home with music blaring in her ears, her eyes trained on the road. It was easier to ignore the things people said than to try to forget them later. <nl> It was a little lucky, in retrospect. <nl> She never would have heard him if she did not pause to change the song right then. But then beyond her headphones she heard someone speak. She turned her head and yanked her earphones down. <nl> A homeless man, his face worn by exhaustion and time, sat on a dusty sleeping bag. His stare rooted her to the spot; his eyes were bluer than any she had ever seen. He had hung a piece of tarp over his nest like a roof. He had a tin cup with a couple of one dollar bills. <nl> Eris's dark eyes went wide and dewy with shock. "I'm sorry," she said. "What did you say?" <nl> "I said," the man said, with a tone of lazy surprise, "you're real, too." <nl> She stopped, rooted to the spot. Stared at him directly now. <nl> Just like her, there was no box hovering over his head. He simply sat on the pavement. Existing. Unobtrusive as some piece of the background. <nl> "You don't have a stats bar," she murmured. <nl> "Am I your first one?" His tone was bitter but delighted. "Sit down, pretty girl. Talk with me for a minute. No one ever talks to me anymore." <nl> She sat on the concrete beside him. Breathed through her mouth, discretely. "What do you mean I'm real?" <nl> "Those other people--" he gestured to the city beyond, the cars whisking past them in a constant ebb and flow "--are not real. You and I are." He smiled, dreamily, his eyes somewhere distant and faraway. "There were more of us, when I was young. I've heard they've begun to dismantle the whole thing." <nl> Eris could only stare at him. Wondering if he was mentally ill. If she was an idiot for sitting here listening to him ramble. <nl> But he did not sound ill. He sounded very tired, and very sane. <nl> "What's your name?" she asked him. <nl> "Cassius." His stare probed her face for something. She was not sure what to offer him. "You must be one of the controls." <nl> "I honestly don't know what you're talking about." <nl> That made him start laughing in real joy and delight. He stood up and began gathering up his things. Placing it in a torn but serviceable trash bag. <nl> "You can buy me a coffee," he told Eris, cheerily. "And I will explain everything." <nl> She gripped her headphones, tightly. Panic chased itself in circles in her belly like a dog after its own tail. <nl> Finally she managed, dizzily, "Okay then." <nl> *** <nl> [Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/shoringupfragments/comments/805mqj/wp_the_control_group_parts_1_and_2/) | [Part Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/shoringupfragments/comments/8068rk/the_control_group_part_3/) | [Part Four](https://www.reddit.com/r/shoringupfragments/comments/806wt8/the_control_group_part_4/) | [Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/shoringupfragments/comments/809092/the_control_group_part_5/) | [Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/shoringupfragments/comments/80a199/the_control_group_part_6/) | [Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/shoringupfragments/comments/80amiz/the_control_group_part_7/) | [Part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/shoringupfragments/comments/80e7tp/the_control_group_part_8/) <nl> Thank you so much for reading. <3 <nl> /r/shoringupfragments <eos>

<sos> The dawn poured a bucket of freshly pressed orange juice over the countryside. The succulent fruit grew wildly all over the side of the mountain, covering the gray rock with thick roots and lush leaves. <nl> The rapidly filling basket weighed heavily on Evelyn's arm, and she stopped to catch her breath. In the hazy distance, a jagged skyline of Florence rose out of the dark green carpet of the Italian countryside. She'd always wondered what it would be like living there, to walk the busy streets, see all the wonders of art and science. <nl> With a sigh, she lifted the basket and started dragging it back toward the mansion. Her dad had always told her that the city was best left alone, but her new master had shown her some of his strange inventions and had promised to take her there someday. <nl> "Hey! Excuse me!" <nl> A woman stepped out from behind a boulder. Her dark hair grew into her eyes, and a smile curved her lips. Evelyn felt the basket leave her hand. The oranges spilled down the side of the hill. Wide-eyed, Evelyn stared at the woman as she dusted off her shoulders and then hurried over. <nl> "I didn't mean to frighten you!" she said, chasing the escaping fruits. "I'm not from around these parts." <nl> "I... where did you? I mean... *what do you want*?" Evelyn said, narrowing her eyes. <nl> The woman wore a man's attire with trousers and an offensively tight tunic, which shoved every curve of her body. Her sleeves extended into shiny gloves of some strange material. An unusual pinging noise came from the woman's pocket and she pulled out a tablet of some sort. It was glossy like the surface of a calm lake. <nl> "Huh..." the woman muttered and ran a hand through her dark locks. "Interesting..." <nl> She swept her finger over the surface and brought the tablet up to her face. <nl> "What is that thing?" <nl> "Oh, um, nothing," the woman said, putting it away. "Does anyone live nearby?" <nl> "Only my master," Evelyn said. <nl> "Can you take me to him?" <nl> Evelyn shook her head. "He doesn't like to be disturbed." <nl> "Trust me, in my case he would." The woman flashed a winning smile. "I've traveled a long way to meet him." <nl> "Fine, follow me." Evelyn took the half-full basket and dragged it up the hill, back to the mansion. <nl> She found her master in the courtyard. It was unusual to see him awake at this hour, but he appeared ready and eager to start the day. His fingers worked to position an easel for the right lighting. It was one of the things she admired about him. He always woke up with that gleam of curiosity in his eyes. <nl> "Hello there!" the woman said, breaking away from Evelyn and ignoring proper introductions. "Leonardo Da Vinci, right?" <nl> A wrinkle appeared between his bushy eyebrows. "That is right. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking to?" <nl> The woman smiled sagely and sat down in the only chair in the garden. She once again pulled out the tablet. "I'm ready when you are." <nl> Evelyn hurried up to the woman, barely able to hide her outrage. "I'm sorry, master. I'll make her leave, or else get the guards here to do so." <nl> "Okay, hold on!" the woman said and looked at Da Vinci. "You've had an urge to paint for a while, but you haven't been able to decide what; true?" <nl> The artist nodded slowly. An expression Evelyn hadn't seen before spread across his face. He lifted an eyebrow and his mouth opened slightly. Surprise. <nl> "How about you paint me?" the woman said. "Just let me know the password to the wifi, so I have something to do." <nl> "I'm intrigued," Da Vinci said. "Tell me your name and I'll consider not having you thrown off the property." <nl> "Lisa," the woman said and a mysterious smile danced across her lips. <nl> *** <nl> **Thanks for the gold!** <nl> r/Lilwa_Dexel <eos>

<sos> It's amazing how much people change after high school.  Chard Burkheart was the star quarterback in high school, the most popular guy in school.  Now he works at a gas station with a pot belly and no hair.  Dave Spellerman went from bullied nerd to Internet billionaire.  All that time spent on a computer really paid off for him. <nl> And then there's Rosalyn "Roz" Churchill went from my childhood friend to my high school flame to leader of the criminal underground.  That one was definitely a curveball. <nl> All I wanted to do was use the ATM.  Then some thugs in ski masks bust in and hold me at gunpoint, threatening to shoot me if they didn't open the register.  I thought it was all over until the weirdest damn thing happened.  See, one of the guys took my wallet and started pocketing all my cash.  But when they saw my driver's license, this tough, beefy criminal starts freaking out. <nl> "It's him!  It's the guy on the "No Harm" list!  We just held Mike Peterson at gunpoint!" <nl> One of the other guys grabbed my wallet, looked inside, and just froze.  "Oh shit," he said.  "If Roz finds out, we're fucking dead!"  So the thugs just drop my wallet on the ground and pulls some money out of his pocket.  He hands it to me and tells me "please don't tell Roz.  It was a mistake, honestly!"  Then they ran out of there as fast as they could.  And I was left standing there as everyone in the bank looked at me, wondering what the hell just happened.  No way it could be *that* Roz...right? <nl> Roz was one of those girls you only think exist in movies.  The girl that comes into your life to turn it upside down, that wild and rebellious girl who gets you to loosen up and enjoy life.  She did ever since we were kids and when high school came around I gathered up the courage to ask her out.  We dated for a few years but when college rolled around, we realized we were heading separate ways in life.  So we broke up, very amicably, and eventually lost touch.  It wasn't until I started tracking her down that I realized she had even come back to town. <nl> Finding her location was surprisingly easy.  I drove into the shadier part of town and started asking around.  Whenever I said her name, their faces would get deathly pale.  Some just ran away, terrified for their lives.  The ones who didn't filled me in.  Apparently, Roz is basically the queen of some massive criminal organization with influence all over the world.  She's basically the queen of crime.  No one even jaywalks without getting her permission.  Those who disobeyed her had a habit of disappearing. <nl> I couldn't believe it.  Roz, some evil mastermind?  She was one of the sweetest people on the planet.  No way she was some sort of super mafia boss.  As I dug deeper, I learned that she apparently put me on a "No Harm" list.  Though it wasn't much of a list as I was apparently the only one on it.  None of her old friends or even her family made it on the list (which wasn't surprising considering the strained relationship she had with her parents).  Roz decreed that anyone who tried to harm me in any way was to be killed.  After a little more digging, I finally found what I was looking for- the address of her headquarters. <nl> So I here I was, standing outside of some abandoned looking warehouse, about to meet my criminal ex-girlfriend.  All in all, not how I expected to spend my Saturday.  I walked to the entrance and some big bouncer looking type stopped me.  "Sir, I'm gonna half to ask you to leave." <nl> "Look, I'm here to see Roz, she's an old friend of mine and-" Without warning, the guy started walking towards me.  He reached for a gun and cocked it. <nl> "Sir, no on sees the boss.  Now, please leave or I will *make* you leave." <nl> I put my hands up defensively and shouted "My name is Mike Peterson!  Please, I just want to talk to Roz!" <nl> The guy's face looked pale and he backed up immediately.  "Mike Peter- my apologies sir, I didn't know!"  He then got on his knees and started begging.  "Please, *please* don't tell the boss about this!  I wouldn't have done it if I had known who you were!" <nl> "Uh, sure," I said, wanting to move this along as quickly as possible before it got more awkward. <nl> The guy got up and walked back to the door, holding it open for me.    He was sweating now, his facing showing pure terror.  "Please, sir, after you."  I steeled myself for what would happen next and walked in. <nl> I expected a lot of things.  But I didn't expect to see Roz sitting on a golden throne atop a massive pile of money. <nl> The guard approached the pile and said "Ma'am, Mike Peterson has come to speak with you." <nl> Roz looked like she was in intense thought about something but once she heard my name she turned her attention to me, her face beaming with joy.  "Mikey!  Oh my gosh, it is you!"  She slid down the money pile and gave me a massive hug.  "I missed you so much.  You look good.  Gosh, what's it been, 10?  12 years?" <nl> "Yeah, just about.  I see you've been...busy," I said, motioning to the pile. <nl> "Oh, yes, it's been a great quarter.  But with the upcoming expansions I expect to see some massive improvements.  Come on, let's catch up."  With that, Roz took my hand and led me to an elevator.  She pushed a button and we went down. <nl> Turns out the place was way bigger than I thought.  Underneath the warehouse were greenhouses for pot, crates full of guns, and tables of people counting stacks of $100 bills.  She even had a private jet down here.  As we walked through warehouse, Roz told me all about how she ended up here.  Selling pot to pay for college, which became a lucrative business.  She hired some people to help and the operation grew to selling illegal imports, from Kinder eggs to assault rifles.  The money she earned helped pay for high-tech equipment to set up other branches of her "business" all around the world.  Plenty of gangs and mafias were against her taking over but they were either taken down or forced to join.  In just over a decade, Roz became the criminal mastermind of the world.  She even had enough power to influence government policies and could even control the elections.  She had become the shadow government ruling the world behind the curtain. <nl> "So after cementing my authority," Roz continued.  "I decided I should use my newfound power for good.  And because of that, the world is a safer place.  Crime is dropping every year, Mike.  Sure, some crazy guy starts murdering people every once in a while.  We can't control that.  But drug trafficking, armed robberies, even political corruption?  That we can control." <nl> "Wow, Roz.  I'll admit, your means are...unorthodox.  But you've definitely made the world a better place." <nl> "Thank you, Mike," she said, wrapping her arms around my neck.  "I always regretted losing touch with you.  I know we had to go our separate ways but I always wanted to reconnect with you.  That's why I came back, why I put you on the list.  I wanted to see you again and catch up.  Maybe grab a bite to eat.  Like the good old days." <nl> I stared into her eyes for what seemed like eternity and I felt like I did in high school all over again.  Just me and her, nothing else.  I missed this feeling.  I missed Roz.  "I'd like that," I said finally. <nl> "Oh, I almost forgot," she said.  "I've got another surprise for you."  She ushered me over to the other side of the room.  All I could think about was how little she changed.  She was still that spunky girl, carving her own path to save the world.  Sure she did it through organized crime but the at least it was organized.  She was still that same kindhearted girl I fell in love with all those years ago. <nl> She led me to a dimly lit room at the far end of the basement level.  Inside, bound and gagged, were three men.  They looked terrified but Roz was practically beaming with pride.  "So, what do you think?" <nl> "Roz, who are these people?" <nl> "These are the no good dirty thugs who held you at gunpoint at the bank.  I had my men track them down and bring them here to educate them."  With that, Roz whipped out a handgun and loaded a clip.  She pointed it at the one on the left and slowly drifted it across all three of them.  "Now," she said.  "Which one of you little shits put a gun to my Mikey's head?" <nl> Okay, maybe she wasn't the *exact* same kindhearted girl I fell in love with. <nl> EDIT: HOLY FUCKING SHIT I FINALLY STRUCK GOLD! Not gonna lie, I half-assed this story at 2AM and was too tried to proofread it.  I honestly thought it was kind of meh but I liked the prompt and I already spent so much time on it so I posted anyway.  Guess I'm just too hard on myself.  To read more of my work, check out my award-winning novel that I've totally started.  It's coming out soonish, I promise! <nl> EDIT 2: I wanted to write part 2 in the comments below but it got really long.  So I created a brand new subreddit to post it right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mikesonofpeter/comments/81weik/wp_during_a_bank_robbery_youre_surprised_when_the/).  Come over to r/mikesonofpeter to read the conclusion to this story.  Who knows, maybe I'll write more there? <eos>

<sos> "Mmhmm, okay lets play!" Emma squealed excitedly. Death shook his head involuntarily under his hood at her enthusiasm but caught itself before letting its reaction show on its face. <nl> "What game shall we wager?" Death asked. <nl> Emma being freed from the excruciating pain from the events earlier in the day was smiling and admiring the parts of her body which had become anew. She was free from the haunting strobe light memory flickering to grotesque scenes of her tibia extruding from her shin, a pool of blood spreading on her favorite dress, and the view of rapidly passing rectangular light boxes which eventually faded to black. "Did you fix me?" she looked up inquisitively as she asked. <nl> Death replied in monotone, "A question is not an answer to the question. Pick a game." <nl> "Well you say cheating is okay but I always hated when Julie cheated but she always won so I want to try it but you have to promise me not to get mad," Emma blabbered. "Let's play Rock, Paper, Scissors!" <nl> "Wise are the ones to leave fate up to chance. Any other conditions? Best of 3?" Death said. Death took a liking to this simple game. Seldom had the dying spirit chose this game instead opting for higher chances of survival. Death found it amusing that humans, who did nothing to enrich their soul but rather spent time on accumulating wealth, had such a deep desire to retain their undeveloped worthless soul. <nl> "No just once. Ready?" Emma held her fist up, "On three. Not after. Like one, two, three and when we say three you put your hand out. We both say 1-2-3. One..." <nl> Death repeated after her catching up to her rhythm. <nl> "Two." They said in unison.  Death looked up at her eyes which were focused intensely on its own. "Three!" <nl> Death having sensed no malice from Emma simply threw out its favorite, scissors. But looking down at the skeletal hand flexed in bunny ears it saw or rather did not see Emma's hand. <nl> "I pick rock!" Emma shouted over giggles. She put her fist out next to Death's scissors. "You lose! Julie taught me this one. It made me really mad and I called her a cheater but she said 'no *you* not *we* put your hand out,' and when I went to mommy crying Julie just laughed. You promised you won't be mad." <nl> Death stood silent. Emma's spirit faded away back towards the realm of the living. <nl> "Innocence of children; I lose to you yet again." <eos>

<sos> "And here we have the line of burst blades." <nl> Ruby finally started paying attention. She didn't give a crap about plasmaxes or vibroblades. She'd come to this overly uppity shop for one reason and one reason only, and the goddamn docent she'd been stuck with had finally gotten to them. <nl> "Which ones have the longest burst range?" Ruby started with the obvious. It always paid to be able to hit your enemy before they could hit you. <nl> "These six are especially-" The smarmy docent began to speak, then stopped as Ruby took two off the shelves and popped open the hilt casing on the first one. <nl> Ruby took her time examining the names and types of components built into the burster. These swords were flimsy as hell, and in no way useful for a melee. They were built for an entirely different purpose. They had a wide amplification cone instead of a cross-guard, and the blade was actually a sonic tuner. One good blast from a burster could deafen and disorient an entire group of people. <nl> "Crap." She dropped the one she'd been examining on the floor and opened the second one. Brand name components, and a lot of them were bad names to be in a burster. <nl> "Hizman and Sons power cells in a burster? What idiot would buy this?" <nl> "Ma'am-" <nl> Ruby threw the second sword on the ground and grabbed two more. Two more examinations, two more sounds of disgust and dropped bursters. <nl> "Ma'am!" The docent intercepted her before she reached for the last two. <nl> "Get-" <nl> "Ma'am." The docent's voice was softer now, and his eyes twitched to the front of the store. "If you are after more...quality items, then perhaps we can take a look *in the back.*" <nl> Ruby paused, then grinned. So this is why Big Jake had sent her here. <nl> Three minutes later she was looking at a *real* weapon display. <nl> "Is that a Nigon-44 with chain razors?" Ruby felt her eyes widen as she saw the twenty-eight foot extension all coiled up, the small blades had all been polished to a shine. <nl> "It's actually a 45b, the military version." The docent was different back here. He was less smarmy, less invasive, and his face was harder and keener. "It comes with a set of detonating stickers that can be used in place of the razors. Hit a foe, and three seconds later he explodes." <nl> "Nice." Ruby let true emotion show in her voice, "But a bit bulky for my needs." <nl> "So you're after well-concealed bursters? Hm, you may appreciate this then." <nl> Ruby turned around and fell in love. <nl> "A Sigusman 626!" Ruby rushed over to the finely crafted rapier-like burster with a collapsible cross-amplifier and six activation mode toggles on it's handle. She had the hilt apart in seconds and fell into a running litany of awe and shopping fever. <nl> "Hand built transmission array!" Ruby breathed, "A Volkan power cell with kinetic recharge! How did they fit that in here?! Clux Tuner! It has it's own *tuner?*" <nl> "I see that you approve." The docent carefully took the blade from her and reconstructed the hilt with the ease of a professional, "But now I must ask you to stop handling the merchandise." <nl> "Fine, so I guess you want to talk price then?" <nl> "If you wish." The docent replaced the sword on the display with utmost care. "But we like to provide our special clients with, hm, payment options." <nl> "Oh?" <nl> "You could pay the sticker price on this, which is enough to support a few families for a dozen years... or you could do me a personal favor and you receive the weapon as compensation." The docent turned and this time there was no hint of the idiot who had been escorting her in the front of the store. "Consider it a trade, of sort." <nl> Ruby grinned. This might even be a better deal than she thought. <nl> "Whatya got in mind?" <nl> "I need a certain item, and the police seem to have, hm, appropriated it from a client of mine. Retrieve it and the Sigusman here is all yours." <nl> "Well, that's great." Ruby loved a challenge, "I can appreciate that kind of one-payment plan." <nl> "Excellent." The docent's smile broke quickly and vanished just as fast. "I'll get the paperwork started." <eos>

<sos> Elli was born without the names. Some people thought that she was blessed. She was not faced with knowing the name of the person who would kill her. Others believed it was a curse, some kind of disability. She had to admit that not having the names made her wonder if there *was* something wrong with her. Everyone has the names. So what does that mean about her? Will she never really be loved? Will she eventually become so lonely she'll just... kill *herself*? <nl> That was what she believed until she met Brian. He was beautiful, smart, funny, and *he had her name*. He knew about her predicament, and didn't care. He loved her, even if it meant she'd never really be his. <nl> Two years after dating, she accepted his marriage proposal. Their parents disagreed because of her "disfigurement", but it didn't matter. They were in absolute bliss. Through all the doubt, all the worry, she knew this was meant to be. <nl> That was until two months before the wedding, when her mother burst into her home while Brian was away. <nl> "You can't marry him!" Her mother yelled. <nl> "We've talked about this, mom. He doesn't care that I don't have the names. We love each other!" Elli explained. <nl> "I know he doesn't care, but you just can't marry him Elli! You can't! It's not meant to be!" She insisted. <nl> "Then tell me why. Why can't you just let us be happy?" <nl> Her mother sighed and sat down at their dining room table. It seemed as if she was struggling to find the words. "Your father and I... We were tortured by the names. We were happy that it allowed us to find each other but knowing the names of our killers... It tortured us, Elli. We wanted things to be different for you." <nl> "What are you saying, mom?" She asked, panicked. <nl> Her mother paused, looking at the floor. <nl> "WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?" Elli demanded. <nl> "We had them removed, Elli. People aren't supposed to know these things. We wanted life to be better for you." <nl> Elli's mind went blank. She wasn't a freak. She wasn't disfigured. Her parents did this to her. Elli looked up, finally understanding what her mother was saying. "Did I have his name? Please tell me. Please tell me I had Brian's name." Elli begged. <nl> Her mother stared at her for a long time before finally shaking her head. "I'm sorry honey." <nl> Elli started crying, her mind racing. The one person she loved most in the world was not her soulmate. She'd already built a life with him, loved him, made promises, shared secrets, planned their perfect wedding and imagined their perfect home, they'd even picked out names for their future children. <nl> Names... <nl> That's when she realized. She didn't have his name... but he still had hers. <eos>

<sos> "M'lady, in your eyes I see the...uhm...excuse me. M'lady, in your eyes I see the greatest jewels eve...erm...right...just...I need, uhm,  just a second." <nl> The valiant Prince from the neighboring lands of Dahalia cleared his throat nervously. Sweat dripped from his forehead and his face was beet red. With a milquetoast flourish of his gloved hand, he attempted to begin again. <nl> "M'lady, in your, sweet, precious eyes, I can see the very..." <nl> Drago hiccupped, sending a tiny plume of green tinged flame out of his left nostril. <nl> The Prince of Dahalia recoiled a full five feet and his regal veneer broke completely. "Good lord, how can you keep such a beast beside you at all times?! Must it have followed us even into the garden?" <nl> Malinda sat gracefully on Drago's furled tail, her face a mixture of disdain and embarassment. Disdain for yet another supposedly valiant suiter turned coward. Embarassment because, of course, the Prince was right. Drago was larger than a house and in landing in the castle garden, his scaled body had crushed an entire season's worth of azeleas. <nl> But being right didn't make him likable. "If your grace has no affection for Drago, your grace has no affection for me." Drago's fearsome visage reared up beside her then and loosed a small, agreeing roar. <nl> The heroic, stalwart Prince of Dahalia nearly pissed himself in fear, and ran out of the garden faster than a horse on fire. <nl> Pleased to be free of his company, Malinda laid a gentle hand behind Drago's right ear. "What *am* I to do with you, my oldest friend." <nl> Drago purred affectionately and settled his bull sized head down on the gardener's prized rose bush. <nl> Malinda couldn't help but smile. <nl> ****** <nl> The list of suitors for the hand of the Princess of Galta was growing shorter by the day. Men came from all over the known world, only to turn right back around at the sight of a living dragon. <nl> Great merchants from the desert cities of the east, wearing exotic skins and colored clothes, cowered in terror beneath Drago's discerning stare. <nl> Princes of every shape and size came to Galta seeking Malinda's affections, many bearing tales of great deeds, done greatly. But to a man, each broke under the withering intensity of Drago's presence, inevitably bolting for the door at every random burp or fart. <nl> Malinda was beginning to suspect Drago was more than complicit in these matrimonial failures. It seemed to her, whenever a conversation with a suitor began to go well, Drago would step in with some simple bodily function and scare the pants off everyone in the room. <nl> Things continued like this for months, until, at last, there were no men of report left. Every man in the known world worth half his weight in gold and social clout had come, and each of them had run away. <nl> Malinda gave up hope, and resigned herself to life as an unmarried Queen. Drago would have to be companion enough. <nl> ******** <nl> One day, years later, Malinda went hunting in the King's wood. While chasing a wild boar, to her astonishment, another's arrow flew through the air and pierced the boar's heart. <nl> Looking around for the unannounced hunter, Malinda saw a man approaching through the forest. He was a ranger, tall and lithe, and in his hands he bore a ranger's bow. <nl> "Forgive me, M'lady, I am just passing through these woods." <nl> Malinda pointed at her prey. "You've spoiled my hunt!" <nl> The ranger looked down at the dead boar in surprise. "Forgive me, M'lady, but I thought twas you being chased by the boar." <nl> This made Malinda smile inside, though her face remained severe. "It is illegal to hunt in the King's wood, ranger." <nl> The ranger bowed his head slightly. "So it is my lady, but is it illegal to save the life of a fair maiden?" <nl> "This maiden needs no saving." Malinda said, her eyes taking on a mischievious look. With a whistle, she called upon Drago, who made his most dramatic entrance, scorching a bank of trees with a bath of dragon fire. <nl> To Malinda's astonishment, the Ranger did not even blink. Instead he let out a little laugh. "Well, isn't that funny." Then, he put his fingers to his mouth and gave his own strong whistle. <nl> From the east, another dragon flew in, wings wide, breast out, mouth ajar and spewing purple flame. <nl> The ranger walked over to the fierce beast and patted her on the head. She purred back at him affectionately "M'lady, I'd like you to meet Arga, my companion in travel." <nl> For Malinda and Drago both, it was love at first sight. <nl> ****** <nl> ## For More Legends From The Multiverse <nl> # r/LFTM <eos>

<sos> "Mom, why did you marry dad? He's so ugly." <nl> The Queen looked at Prince Edward, and scolded him while secretly chuckling to herself. Pulling up a chair next to the young prince's bed, she caressed his head and began to talk soothingly. <nl> "Your dad wasn't always ugly Edward. When we were young, he was a tall glass of water. A little wild for my taste back then, but no one could argue that he wasn't a looker." <nl> "But...you're the queen mom. You could have married anyone you wanted" <nl> "HA! Don't I know it! I was quite a beauty myself too. The Mace Queen, those were the good old days. I ruled my Queendom strictly, but fairly, with my trusty mace at my side." <nl> "You mean, excaliboulder?" <nl> "Yes! Excaliboulder! Your mom was never one to listen to prophecies, so she just took the sword with the stone in it, and decided to rule the land. It was a lot easier than I thought, in retrospect. Turns out it's a lot easier to convince people when you have a 200 pound boulder at your side all the time." <nl> "You were so strong Ma!" <nl> "Haha, and I still am Edward. But I wasn't the only one who was strong enough to lift that sword. Once in a blue moon, I'd come across someone else who was strong enough to use excaliboulder as well. Remember, back then, your mom had a lot of enemies. One day, while collecting taxes from a wealthy port village, a pirate came along and tried to kidnap me and hold me for a ransom." <nl> "Was the pirate dad?" <nl> "Heavens no! What is it with you children and jumping to conclusions all the time. No no, this pirate may have been ugly, but he wasn't your dad. The pirate, however, was also strong. Very strong. When he had me cornered in the alley, he picked up my mace, and swung it at me." <nl> "Did it hurt?" <nl> "Well...I never got hit. You see, just before I was about to have my face smashed in with a rock, a stranger jumped in front of me to shield me. As soon as the rock made contact with his face, the boulder slipped off! Now, everyone was astounded at what happened, and your mom used that split second of surprise to overpower the pirate!" <nl> "And...that stranger was Dad?" Prince Edward said hesitantingly <nl> "You got it! Your dad's face was horribly disfigured, but he had a kind heart, and eventually, we married. I was never one for politics for finance, but it turns out your dad was a very adept trader. He balanced the Queendom's debt, and made it a burgeoning hub for trade!" <nl> "And that's how I was born!" <nl> "You got it!" <nl> "Tell me Mom...do you think the prophecy came true after all? Dad is a King after all, and he may have not pulled the sword from the stone, but he definitely pulled the stone from the sword." <nl> "Maybe my little Prince...but like I said, I was never one for prophecies." <eos>

<sos> The sound of the Sealing was like a chorus of drums. A cacophony of secrets flooding the air around Illias and Miri, as they watched the door be hammered shut from the darkness of their hidden recess in the north wall. <nl> "I bet it's the sick," said Miri. "I bet they lock up the dying. When was the last time you saw someone sick?" <nl> Illias looked at his best friend. Her face was dusty and her eyes both baggy and wild. She was tired, and yet more awake than he'd ever seen her. "Miri," he began in his most authoritative tone, "in all the time we've been camped out here, we've not seen them put a *single* soul behind there. So, maybe it's something else, something boring. Maybe the Tower just gets... old. Maybe it's unsafe down there because of the stairs wearing thin or... or..." <nl> "*Or* maybe it's like your grandpa says." <nl> Illias rolled his eyes. "You don't really believe any of that, do you?" <nl> Miri hunched over and deepened her voice the best she could, imitating the old man. "Secrets live down on the ancient floors, you curious Cratoers! Secrets that would devour the two of you, the Tower, and everything we all take for known! So stay away. You hear me!?" <nl> "Hey, that was pretty good!" <nl> Miri bowed. "Thanks." <nl> Illias turned back to the workers, watching them lock away whatever the secret was, behind a heavy door with at least a hundred nails hammered into it. <nl> "We're never getting through that." <nl> "It's only nails! I don't even need a spell for that.  It's the Swirling doors that are a pain in the ass." <nl> "You think seeing how they enchant them will-" <nl> "Illias!" whispered Miri. "Look!" <nl> He turned to see a cloaked figure walking down the East stairwell. A tall man with a long gnarled staff in his left hand, approaching the workers. His face was shrouded by the shadows of his cowl. <nl> "Who's *that?*" Illias asked. <nl> "I've no idea. I don't think it's anyone from the Coven." <nl> It was the first time either Illias or Miri had seen the actual Sealing process. They'd never before been able to get past the Lower guards to see how it was performed. But today, they'd succeeded. It had been thanks to Miri, really. She figured, from a lot of research and little math, that Floor One would be changing within the week. So they'd taken it in turns to lie to their parents, pretending they were spending the night on each other's Floor-Room. But each night, they'd snuck down to Floor One, and waited. <nl> And hoped. <nl> And after six nights, got lucky. Workers had descended on the floor, swarming it like ants. <nl> *thump!* <nl> "What was that?" hissed Illias, his eyes wide. <nl> *thump!* <nl> The workers backed away from the door. <nl> "I don't-" <nl> *thump!* <nl> Illias saw it this time. The door with a hundred nails was... being *hit*, by something behind it. It was shaking. Trembling. <nl> *thump!* <nl> Five Tower-Guards came hurtling down the stairs, hauling another door between their arms. A Swirling Door. A door with no handles or lock. Whose surface shifted and undulated as it changed from woods to metals, but always remained part liquid. Illias had seen such a door many times before. Each abandoned floor was locked by such a rune-door. And even all Miri's -- not insubstantial -- efforts to open them, had always come to nothing. None of the anti-spells she had learned at school, nor anything from her father's runic book <nl> The guards' faces were pale. Sweating. <nl> "Place it!" yelled the cloaked figure. "Now!" <nl> They lifted the door up and began to manoeuvre it into place. <nl> **thump!** <nl> The nailed door cracked in the center; thick wooden splinters flew into the guards. <nl> "Shit!" cried Illias. He turned to Miri, snatching her hand in his. "I don't think we want to find out what's behind there! We've got to go. Now!" <nl> She shook her hand free. "If they see us leave, we'll be thrown behind the door! Would you rather that? Right, that's what I thought. *We stay.*" <nl> Illias's fingers curled into a ball. Why had he ever listened to Miri? They shouldn't have come down here. Grandpa was right. Secrets should stay secret. <nl> "Secure the Alpha Door," croaked the cowled figure. "Now!" <nl> The guards looked at each other, then at the figure, then nodded. They handed the swirling door to the group of workers, then yelled "Heave!" in unison, as they barged their shoulders against the remnants of the wooden door. <nl> **Thump!** <nl> "Hold firm, lads!" <nl> **Thump!** <nl> Behind the door, through the ever growing crack, Illias thought he saw something in the darkness. Something yellow. It flicked left, then right. *An eye?* <nl> The workers took the Swirling door and held it in place, trapping the guards between the two portals. <nl> **Crack!** <nl> "Tell my Martha tha-" a guard began, before his words turned into agonised screams. <nl> A purple light began to swirl around the edge of the cloaked man's staff, as the workers held the swirling door in place. He touched the tip of the stick against the door and began to utter words incomprehensible to the two children. <nl> The door glazed over, the undulations slowing, abating. <nl> "It is done," said the cloaked man, his head dropping. "You may go." <nl> The workers didn't need telling twice. They almost ran up the stairs, tripping over each other in an effort to escape. <nl> The cloaked man pulled back his cowl. <nl> "Illias!" whispered Miri. "Is that..." <nl> His face was pale, and worn. A face they both knew well, but that had never looked so old as it did in that moment. <nl> "*Grandpa?*" Illias whispered. <nl> --- <nl> #####Part 2 (story 2) here: https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/85si3a/the_spiral_tower_two/ <nl> It's not a direct continuation, but there will be one. I'm doing it as a series of tales inside the tower, that interconnect and together explain its past and present. <eos>

<sos> The drugs kicked in while the doctors all said, "easy now," but Jess felt fine because it meant she'd get to play. Every time her heart stopped, she went to the place she deemed the *cave in her head*. It was where the shadows all dripped, and where the man in black lived with his games. <nl> He was there, waiting, with a checkerboard set. <nl> "I hadn't hoped to see you again so soon," the man said, voice viscous as molasses. He wore a billowing black robe. and every time Jess looked at his face she felt incredibly sleepy. The man swept an arm over the table. His sleeve passed through the polished wood as if it weren't even there. "I let you have red." <nl> The board reminded Jess of Cracker Barrel, where she'd found a pair of scissors and ran around cackling; the scene had made her mother furious, so Jess took her seat eagerly. "Red's my favorite color!" <nl> "Very good," he said. Then he beckoned for the first move. <nl> She made her choices slowly, for there was so much to tell. The man listened to her with an unalarmed interest that she'd found so lacking in adults on the outside. When she told him her dog died in the dryer, the man simply said it was a shame and asked if she'd do the same to the next beast. Meanwhile, he'd left the door wide open for a double-jump to a *King me.* Jess took his pieces while stifling a giggle. Later, she told him to story of the baptism. How her sister had practically glowed, and how furious it made her. The man leaned forward. He nearly toppled Jess's tower of captured black pieces. <nl> "Tell me once more how the water burned." <nl> Jess smiled broadly. "It felt like it does when sis holds my hand." <nl> "Very good," he said. "Very good." <nl> The game was over within the next few turns. Jess screamed victory and the man clapped his hands together once, to the sound of a thunderous boom. As soon as he did so, a light appeared at the edge of the darkness. Jess could see faint figures moving on the other side. <nl> "Next time your mother harms you, prick her with this," the man said. "She knows which of you is which now, no point in waiting any longer." <nl> He held a single black thumbtack. Jess took the gift reverently. <nl> "Mister?" she said, ever so sweetly. <nl> "Yes, my child?" <nl> She tugged on his robe, beckoning him to lean down so she may whisper in his ear. "Mom hates when I curse," she said, conspiratorially. The man tilted his head, but Jess let the statement hang in the air for a brief moment, savoring the man's confusion. <nl> Then she ran off and squealed: <nl> "But you're really *fucking shit* at games." <nl> As Jess ran towards the light with her new gift, cackling like a gremlin, the man's remained in the shadows. <nl> "I wouldn't say that," he said, if only to himself. "I wouldn't say that at all." <eos>

<sos> Mrs Haller had planned endlessly for such a day. There was a lake on the fringes of the city which had taken her fancy, for the waters ran deep, and anglers seldom came by. She would close her bank accounts, end her cable service, mail the title deeds to her favourite charity. Then, she would get into her Beetle, drive to the edge of the lake, cast her dice for the final time, and meld once and for all into the cool, inviting depths. <nl> It was a good plan, by all accounts. <nl> But the grief was far stronger than she was, and she found herself on the roof of New Hope Hospital, one foot already lifted off solid ground, dangling in the air. A gust of wind tipped her over, and downwards did Mrs Haller plunge, as quickly as the dread that settles when a phone rings in the middle of the night. <nl> Time froze. <nl> Death had chosen the guise of a young boy this time, no more than eight or nine years old. Golden hair, chiselled features, grubby fingers. Mrs Haller knew it was Death because she was floating upside down, and he was the only one bobbing weightlessly beside her. <nl> "But it isn't your time yet!" Death said, a frown on his face. "You're making things difficult for me again, June!" <nl> "I'm getting dizzy looking at you," said Mrs Haller. "Right me up or strike me down now, I don't care which, but just do it now already." <nl> Death snapped his fingers, and Mrs Haller spun gently around. She scrabbled at the pouch by her side, ripped off the drawstring with haste, then poured out the ebony dice within. The pits on them glowed a light blue. <nl> "My dear June, it's been forty-five years since we last met. In that time, you have done more than-" <nl> "Oh shut it," said June. "I'm rolling." <nl> "-your fair share of... wait, wait, there's a process to these things, you can't just-" <nl> "Too late." <nl> Mrs Haller cast the dice with all the strength in her arm. They burned dark azure scars as they rolled, and it took some time before they stopped spinning. And there it was, six dice, all lined up in a row, coming to a rest just the way she wanted. <nl> "Six ones, your turn." <nl> "Hang on, hang on! June, you know that-" <nl> "Roll! Now!" Mrs Haller said. A fiery bouquet of anger suddenly bloomed in her chest, and she struck out uncontrollably, shoving Death in the shoulder. "Now! Roll, now!" <nl> Death rolled. <nl> Five dice came up ones, but the last did a maddened pirouette on its edge, then split cleanly along its axis. The light fled its shell, and the dice crumbled into dust. <nl> "Five ones," Death said, as he shrugged. He waved his hand towards her, and Mrs Haller began drifting down harmlessly to the ground. "Looks like you beat me again. Oh well, guess you're going to get another new lease on life, please make the best of-" <nl> "How long have you been letting me win?" <nl> "What? Let you win? No, come on, you know what I stand for, don't you? That's just ridiculous." <nl> Mrs Haller pulled another pouch from her pockets, then held them out for Death to inspect. "Those are the real dice," she said. "I had the first set custom made. Guaranteed to roll all ones. You had to cheat, even, just to make sure you lost to me." <nl> "Me? Cheat? June, that's doesn't make any sense-" <nl> Mrs Haller sighed, then closed her eyes. It was slightly easier this way. <nl> "I don't want to play anymore," she said. "I want to go. Release me, please. Let this all end." <nl> "I can't do that. We had a deal, didn't we? You wanted another chance at life, and you wanted to bet it all on a dice game with me. Well, you won. You got that chance you were looking for. So go on and live it. We played fair and square." <nl> "I'm tired," she said. "I've won, what, eight times now?" <nl> "Ten, actually." <nl> Mrs Haller reached into her pockets, then pulled out a single photograph, creased along the edges. "Haylee's parents just got back together last month. She had begun to pay attention in class again, and I was sure I could get her to catch up with the rest before summer. She had so much ahead of her, you know? She was smart, she cared for others, all she needed was a little more time." <nl> "Ah, Haylee Smith. Yes, I do believe that-" <nl> "So why didn't you give it to her?" Mrs Haller said, as she lunged towards Death in anger. A lifetime ago, many lifetimes ago, she had done the same, only in desperation then. "Why take it away? Why did she have to be at home when her parents fought? She was supposed to be in school, with me! How did she fall? Why did she have to hit her head that way? Why? Why?" <nl> Death hardly flinched. Mrs Haller's hands merely bounced off the nimbus of grey which surrounded him, and so he waited until the adrenaline ebbed. Then he waited a while longer for her to stop sobbing. <nl> "Then move on, June. Find a new city, find a new school. A change of environment will do you good. When you're ready, go back to do what you've always loved, yes? There are always more children out there, just waiting, waiting for you to help them." <nl> "You're really sick, you know that? Sick." <nl> Death pouted. "That is very unkind of you, June. I've only given you what you asked for. You swore on your own life, didn't you? You said you were too young to go, and that you had so much more you wanted to give? Have you tired of that now?" <nl> "I've... I've watched so many of them die," said Mrs Haller, hands pressed to her eyes. "And it seems that no matter what I do... no matter how hard I try to steer them... it's just so senseless how they all end up. So many lose themselves to pointless violence, so many to drugs or drink, and so many others to just stupid, bad luck. Some of them end up happy, yes, but it is so... fleeting. They have a couple of good years, then something happens to them. Something *always* happens to them. Like Haylee... sweet Haylee, just in the wrong place at the wrong time." <nl> Death reached out, then laid his hand on her shoulder. That surprised Mrs Haller so much that she forgot to breathe for a moment. It was the very first time she had ever come into physical contact with him, and there was the most exquisite sense of loss which accompanied his touch. <nl> "How do you think I feel, June?" <nl> They twirled like a pair of dragonflies, coasting in a spiral to the ground. Mrs Haller sank to her knees, then looked up at Death. <nl> "Then why torment me still? Let me go, please. Let it all end." <nl> "I can be selfish too, you know. But June, listen to me. I've had royalty beg me for another chance, wise men, fools, the obscenely rich, the abject poor. Those who did win went on to spend the rest of their lives trying to avoid me, or scheming to outsmart me when next we met. You're... you're different, June. You did as you promised. You spent your life... your lives... helping all these children." <nl> "Is that why you're doing this to me? You want to see me regret my own choice? You want to break me down, force me to realize that there is no such thing as hope in this world?" <nl> Death shook his head, then held out his hand again. He beckoned towards her. <nl> "No, June. When I see you do what you do for those children... let's just say I want to see you help them again, no matter how briefly it lasts. It makes a difference, even if you refuse to see it. Will you continue? If not for me, then for them?" <nl> June mulled it over. <nl> And then she took Death's hand. <nl> --- <nl> /r/rarelyfunny <eos>

The syllogism is quite simple.* <nl> There is a pause. *It's time for you to do your calisthenics, Myles.* <nl> It is not lost on me that she used *exactly* the same tone of voice as last time. Growling, I take my earpiece off and throw it against the wall. <nl> This is, of course, mostly a symbolic gesture. For one, the earpiece is nigh indestructible - which is for the best, as it's one of the only things in the lab that I can use to vent my anger. And for another... <nl> *Myles, your most recent biometrics indicate heavy hormonal fluctuations.* <nl> Annie is now speaking to me through the loudspeakers. <nl> *Your emotional lability has increased 37.5% as well. Initiating Protocol Tau-53.* <nl> Gentle music begins playing. Christ, is that a harp? And all of the wall displays go from showing simulated daytime to stock footage of forest streams. This does not bode well. <nl> *Myles, when a human male goes through puberty, his body goes through many changes. Boys often have strange feelings during this time, but understand that is completely normal. The gonads lower in the scrotal sac, and increase in size. Fortunately, the scrotum expands to accommodate the enlarged testes. As sex drive increases, it is also common to practice mastur...* <nl> "Annie, for the love of all that's holy, end protocol. *End it!*" <nl> The harp music stops and the displays go back to the daytime sim. <nl> *I hope our special talk has made you feel more comfortable about reaching sexual maturity. Do you have any questions?* <nl> "Yeah, one - when the *fuck* am I going to get out of here?" <nl> To my surprise, there is no response. There is *never* no response. I have spent long hours listening to reports on the number of permutations involved in cracking an encrypted code, and reports analyzing the chemical profile of my shit, and any of a number of other things...wishing, praying, trying to *will* Annie to shut up. It has never worked. Not once. <nl> Was that the secret? All this time, I just had to swear at her? I immediately dismiss the idea - I have sweared at her plenty of times. This week alone I've made explicit statements about her parentage, about what her brains are made out of, and a number of other things. And I do *know* it's all farcical because she is not a she, she's a server array running one of the most complex computer programs ever designed (as she likes to remind me) with personality software running over it. But saying "You have shit for a CPU" doesn't have the same ring to it, and computers don't have parents...Bottom line, there are a lot of things that are easier if you just pretend the only other voice you can interact with belongs to a person instead of a highly-specific configuration of silicon and metal. <nl> After a minute, I start to get creeped out. "Annie? Status, please?" <nl> *Please hold. The current process will complete in 37 minutes and 7 seconds. Due to current circumstances, this chamber is being put into isolation mode for your safety.* <nl> What...the...*fuck*. I run to one of the wall displays and switch to data mode, calling information up by hand. If this is the day Annie has gone crazy and decided to flood the whole lab complex with poisonous gas, then...actually, I'm not sure I want to know. But Annie has never asked me to "Please hold." And isolation procedures always come with a 4, 2, and 1 hour warning, along with a 30 second count-down. <nl> And what the hell kind of problem could take Annie offline for over half an hour? <nl> *** <nl> *Part 2 in comments* <nl> Continued on my sub, /r/ShadowsofClouds.

<sos> As another beautiful human with a good figure left the stage, an eight foot tall, dark green, large toothed, pig-nosed, and battle-ready Orc entered the stage. All humans had to work hard not to say anything. <nl> After all, they knew that there were dozens of huge orcs sitting in the crowd, ready to tear them apart. Even the stupidest child could feel the pressure and not say anything stupid. <nl> "Hello there," a beautiful and colourful fairy flew near the Orc's face. "And what's your name?" she asked with a smile. <nl> Orc started to slowly jump on one leg to another, showing off her excitement. She didn't realise that it caused the ground to shake a bit. <nl> "Me, Mulu!" she said. <nl> "Hello, Mulu!" the fairy responded with a smile. "What's your dream?" she asked next question. <nl> "Mulu wants beauty contest!" Mulu responded with a wide grin. "Oh... win it, Mulu can't have beauty contest! Mulu wants win it!" she fixed herself. <nl> "Great! Do you think you have what it takes to win this?" the fairy asked. <nl> "Mulu tries her best! Mulu thinks she tries!" <nl> As she said that, a human finally stood up and shouted: "Oh come on. You're an ugly fuck, why don't you go home? This isn't competition for orcs!" <nl> Other humans gasped while orcs in the crowd showed obvious displeasure. <nl> Mulu, however, started to cry. "Mulu just dreams!" she shook her head and started to run away, shaking the ground as she ran further and further away. Of course, as the Mulu ran away, the human realised how fucked he was. <nl> Mulu ran to a nearby lake. There was also a huge waterfall, filling the lake slowly. Two rivers flowed from the lake, helping the water to continue its journey towards the sea. <nl> Mulu slowly took a seat on a larger rock. Then she looked at the water. An ugly face looked back at her. Even she understood what that human meant. <nl> "Foolish Mulu, impossible dreams," she said, frowning. <nl> Then another orc appeared. It was a bit shorter orc. He had many scars on his face and chest, showing off the battles he had gone through. He was a great orc. <nl> "Skan wonders, Mulu okay?" Skan slowly walked near Mulu and then took a seat on the ground, looking towards Mulu. <nl> "Skan..." Mulu whispered. "Mulu ugly. Mulu never pretty." <nl> Skan got furious, he frowned. "Skan crush that puny human!" He was about to stand up. <nl> Mulu quickly put her hand on Skan's shoulder. "No! Skan no hurt human. Human no harm. Humans speak truth!" She then let her hand go and crossed her hands in front of her. <nl> Skan frowned again. "Skan think your dream true come!" <nl> Mulu raised her eyebrow. "Mulu no understand!" <nl> Skan blushed. "Mulu won contest in my heart!" then he stood up and turned around, facing away from Mulu. Blushing was an obvious weakness of the warrior. <nl> "Skan..." Mulu whispered. She stood up and then put her hand on Skan's shoulder. "Mulu thanks Skan! Skan has pretty scars!" <nl> Skan felt frustration, but also a happiness. <nl> "Skan asking, Mulu wants to go hunt boar?" he turned slowly around and tried not to make an eye contact with Mulu, he was a bit embarrassed. <nl> Mulu blushed. "Mulu thinks... yes. Mulu would want to hunt boar with Skan." <nl> And thus, that was a date. <nl> ---- <nl> /r/ElvenWrites <- For more stories. Also, feel free to leave feedback :)! <eos>

<sos> Gagitha stepped lightly in her rough hide leather heels.  Rodent skull fetishes that she had put small bells in jingled with each step.  Every eye in the dressing room stared at her in stark horror. <nl> *It's okay, just be yourself,* she reminded herself.  *You can be anything you want to be.* <nl> "She can't be serious? Can she?" A slight, beautiful woman asked sarcastically. <nl> "I know, she's hideous."  A smattering of laughter like chimes in the wind cut deeper than the sharpest axe. <nl> She roughly wiped a tear away from her cheek and felt shame and anger for letting the other women get to her so easily. <nl> "Ladies and gentleman.  Please welcome your contestants for Miss Fantasy!" The master of ceremonies shouted to the packed amphitheater.  Thunderous applause reminded Gagitha of charging into battle, axe held high ready to sever the soft limbs from her enemies. <nl> She picked at invisible dust on her dress and smoothed it down over herself. <nl> The line of women slowly moved forward as each one stepped onto the stage, gave a wave and a smile then posed for everyone to admire their figure. <nl> Gagitha swallowed hard and walked onto stage.  The whistles and cheers turned into gasps and muttering. <nl> *Head high, one foot in front of the other. Pause. Wave. Smile.* <nl> She flashed her tusks and a woman in the front row fainted. <nl> The crowd remained silent as the rest of the contestants walked onto stage and took their place in line.  Gagitha's cheeks were burning because even surrounded by these gorgeous women she could feel every eye fixed on her. <nl> "These are your beautiful contestants! Let's get another round of applause before we move onto the talent phase!" The MC shouted trying to breath life into the stunned crowd.  There was a smattering of applause as the women exited the stage to change their outfits. <nl> "You're distracting everyone with your disgusting." <nl> "Why are you ruining this for me?" <nl> "Monster." <nl> Her head sunk with each barb.  *They were right,* she thought sadly as she changed out of her gown into her battle regalia.  Her only talent was fighting, so that's what she was going to do. <nl> Women went one by one onto stage, some women sang, others played music, some recited poetry.  Each performed their talent beautifully and with each one Gagitha grew less and less confident. <nl> The whet stone made a *schlick* sound against the steel head of her axe as she sharpened it out of nervous habit more than necessity. <nl> "And now our very first Orc contestant, Gagitha!" The MC announced. <nl> There were a few boos and angry silence. <nl> She took a deep breath, rolled her shoulders and walked onto the stage, her twin axes gripped in palms slick with sweat. <nl> Gagitha stood in the spotlight and began a slow series of practiced slashes and cuts.  The axes in her hands were an extension of her body, she spun and twisted, the axes whirring around her in a silvery blur. <nl> The judges sat motionless watching her, judging her. <nl> She moved faster, spinning and twisting in an elaborate dance of death.  A whirlwind of destruction on an imaginary battlefield. <nl> And then she turned to the judges and threw one of her axes at the judges table.  The old man, white beard hanging low had no time to react as the axe embedded itself in his chest. <nl> The crowd erupted in panicked shouts. <nl> "I know that's you, Aerinox," Gagitha said grimly, walking toward the edge of the stage. <nl> The old man lifted his gaze from the axe handle jutting out of his chest and met her eyes. <nl> "How did you know?" He rose from his chair and pulled the axe out as if it was a splinter.  He snapped his hand forward throwing the axe back.  Gagitha leaned backward and caught the axe as it spun past her. <nl> "A demon of vanity? Where else would I look." She threw herself off the stage chopping downward with the twin axes as he began to transform.  Flesh sloughed off the old man revealing the scaled reptilian body.  The axes bit savagely into the scales eliciting a pained grunt from the demon. <nl> He slashed at her with black razor sharp claws taking a chunk out of her shoulder.  The crowd fled in every direction trying to escape the melee. <nl> They traded devastating blows, scales and green flesh flying. <nl> The demon slashed her arm forcing her to drop an axe, the muscles severed leaving her hand useless and limp. <nl> A smile spread across the demon's face revealing rows of black jagged teeth. <nl> "This is the end for you. You could never defeat me. Or win this contest. You're just as monstrous to them as I am." It barked a laugh and lunged forward releasing a flurry of blows. <nl> She parried the attacks as best as she could with one axe but they claws were tearing her apart.  Pain and blood bloomed from nearly every part of her body. <nl> "I could have won this," she said through clenched teeth. <nl> She ducked a swing and slammed the blade of the axe into the demon's stomach.  Black blood gushed out covering her hands.  She released the axe and grabbed one of the demon's horns and wrapped her other arm around its neck, choking and twisting.  It tried to resist, fighting her for each inch as its neck turned.  With a final surge the demon's neck snapped with a sickening pop. <nl> She released the corpse and knelt beside, her chest heaving with each deep breath she sucked in. <nl> The crowd erupted in deafening applause and cheers. <nl> "I think we've seen enough," the two remaining judges said walking up to Gagitha. <nl> "We have our contest winner!" <nl> --- <nl> Thanks for reading!

<sos> I've always been slow. My synapses, they tell me, don't exactly fire like yours do. They sputter and choke and cough,  and half the time it's a false start anyway. So I'm not much good in a fight, because I see the world like one of those movies that flickers along in black and white, skipping frames and leaving the inbetweens to your imagination. One moment there might be a boy who looks at me like a cat looks at a juicy old lap, ready to sink his claws in. Then I might see a blur of knuckle wavering through the air. Then maybe I taste blood and feel a nosefull of pain. <nl> I was slow everywhere and at everything. Usually a bad thing, I'll admit. But I'd like to think in the bedroom, I at least held my own. Well, most of the time I had to, to tell you the truth -- if I didn't have enough money. <nl> Ageing, my mom used to say, was my true gift. That I was born for a purpose. "You'll see what the planet looks like in two hundred years! Won't be no more war, or hatred or bullying. None of this stuff, baby." Then she'd stare up at the stars. "Maybe someday you'll get to step foot up there on the moon itself." <nl> Well she was a bit of a romantic, but she wasn't far off the mark, as it turns out. <nl> I must have seen a hundred doctors, growing up. Autism, some said. The first few we saw. That's why he speaks so damned slow, Mrs Smith. That's why it takes him so long to add two and two, or to balance this cube on that cube. But they weren't really certain. All I think they knew for sure is it damn well wasn't ADHD. <nl> As I grew physically, which is to say as slowly as I think, they labelled me with CHILD syndrome. The body just... *stops* growing.  Sorry Mrs Smith, but your James is always going to be a tiny toddler. Luck of the draw, they said to her. Implying she got unlucky. That she lost.  She never thought so. Only reason we even saw so many doctors was because of my red in the face father. Always red, his face. From embarrassment, or disappointment. From anger or from drink.  From his blood pressure, too, which is what got him in the end. If he'd just taken a leaf out of your book, mom said, and just slowed on down. <nl> Heh. <nl> After mom died, to tell you the truth, I was alone. I always knew I was alone in how I was, but to be actually alone -- all alone -- well, that was something else. <nl> Proxima Centauri b. Even with all that wonderful technology available, even with cryo rests to let the pilot sleep for four fifths of the journey, it was too far for any human to reach. And there *has* to be a pilot on board. Someone to tweak controls if it all started going south down shit creek. Someone to start the machine up once there, too. To get the embryos turning into little people. <nl> I guess that's why they reached out to me. <nl> I didn't see much of a reason to stay anway, not with mom gone up to the stars. Heck, maybe I'd find her somewhere up there.  So, I said yes and I got to training. Those boys and girls at NASA are much smarter than anyone I ever knew, and they made up equipment that would work real slow. That was built just for me and my body. Was the first time since mom died that I felt special. <nl> I miss Earth. I do. Whiskey and wine, music and smells. But now, I got something better. The sound of twenty children playing and laughing. Not laughing at me no more, but at each other, or with me as we play my slow 'old man' games. <nl> This. This is where I belong. The gravity is just a little bit less here, and everything feels a little bit slower. Just feels *right*. <nl> --- <nl> /r/nickofnight <eos>

<sos> ######[](#dropcap) <nl> Victoria could imagine her father's face already. It would be a mottled shade of purples and reds, and he would be clenching his fists in that way that told her she was about to in Real Big Trouble. <nl> And she wanted to blame him for the whole situation. She really did. But laying in Thomas's arms, feeling his heartbeat next to her ear, she couldn't help but feel a little sheepish. <nl> When her father had told her she was going to marry a stranger, she had thought of about a million ways to die. Then, she thought, it was simply too much trouble, and she had so many books she had yet to finish, so she chose instead to run away. It was perhaps a miracle that when she was rappelling down her window with her sheets, she saw someone else doing the same just a couple doors down. <nl> She got down first, so she had stalked over to their side to see what was up with them that they too wanted to leave. As fate would have it, they were peas in a pod. Quite literally. Peas in the pod of marriage. <nl> So because company was always preferable to none, they ran away together. For three months, they travelled across Europe, visiting all sorts of cities. And day after day, despite the fact that she knew she shouldn't, she felt herself falling in love with him. <nl> He had been a traveler before, so he took her to the most romantic locations. They walked through the canals at Amsterdam, snorkeled in Santorini, shared gelato in Venice. It was almost like a honeymoon. Except as time drew on, Victoria felt herself grow unhappier. <nl> When he wasn't looking, she would glance longingly at his side profile, wishing that he would fall in love with her like she fell in love with him. But her gaze was on his constantly, which was how she knew his was never on her. Perhaps he simply saw her as someone to share his knowledge of the world with. <nl> So five months into the trip, when her father put out an ad and told her that he would drop the wedding if she would only return, she decided that it was time to go home. Time to leave fantasy behind. <nl> On their last night together in Paris, he took her to Point Zero. Under the dim light of the stars, he told her, his hazel eyes sparkling, "This is the point from which all distances in France are measured. It's the center of everything. If you make a wish here, it'll come true." <nl> When she stood on the star, her eyes closed, feeling the cool spring breeze on her skin and wishing that she could forget him as soon as possible, she felt warm lips on hers. Even through her disbelief, she managed to bring her hands up, wrapping her arms around his neck and tugging him closer. If this was all she would have of him, then so be it. <nl> &nbsp; <nl> It turned out he had asked her father for her hand in marriage. That it wasn't a plot between their parents. He said he fell in love with her two years ago, when she was volunteering at the animal shelter and he had come in to adopt. When he had realized that she was reluctant, he had guessed she would run away. <nl> She wanted to be angry at him. She really did. But seeing the vulnerability in his eyes, she simply laid her head down on his shoulder. What was the point in getting angry? He hadn't hidden a big secret such as murdering someone, and he had told her in the end. All that was left now, was going home to tell her father that the wedding preparations should still commence. <nl> When she told her father, his face turned a shade of red that she had never seen before. "You'll get married to him over my dead body!" he yelled. <nl> Her jaw dropped. "But papa, you wanted me to marry him before!" <nl> "After making me a laughingstock in front of everyone in the town, having to put out that ad, you want to come back and say you're marrying him after all?" He snorted. "And after you eloped with him for half a year." He turned and walked into his study, slamming the door shut behind him. <nl> Victoria groaned. She laid down on the wood floor outside the study, her body splayed out into a giant A. This was going to be a long battle. She could tell. <nl> ***** <nl> r/AlannaWu <eos>

<sos> Anna wasn't a city girl, but she did venture to the markets on a semiregular basis and found herself in a trinket shop hardly different from any other. The walls were lined with odd tapestries and art pieces. Shelves lined every wall and almost all the floor space, affording little room to walk between them. They were full of wooden figures, gemstone rings, deeds of dubious origin, pagan relics, utensils, coinage of fallen empires, and simple copper cups. <nl> But on the far wall, a sword mounted on a porcelain plaque caught her eye. It was about six feet in length, made of an unusual rose-colored alloy. The blade was engraved with waves of fire. The hilt was similarly decorated, it being of a black metal inlaid with the same crimson alloy. A decorative sword, she reasoned. To sell a functional weapon at such a place, and not a blacksmiths, would be highly unusual. The blade even looked a bit thin for its length to be functional. <nl> She reached out a hand towards the crimson metal. It gave off a little warmth, like a living thing, that she sensed before touching it. <nl> The moment skin touched metal, visions flashed through her mind. She saw the sword, and herself with it. It was carried up cold, high peaks. Over dunes and valleys. Across infinite seas. It slew kings and destroyed kingdoms, and in doing so plunged civilization into unseen depths of barbarism. But with each low, it rose to even greater heights. She saw this sword's destiny: to forge a new humanity that, without such a force, would never exist. She hastily withdrew her hand and knew what she had to do. <nl> She brought the impossibly lightweight claymore to the counter and placed a handful of coins beside it. A trifling amount, even for such a worthless relic, but, to her surprise, the shopkeeper did not barter. <nl> Anna recollected that memory fondly. How many years had it been, exactly? She was only halfway across the frozen mountain peaks. The tough climb and thin air pushed her body to its limits. With every weary step, the temptation to rest grew stronger. But here, she would never recoup the strength to stand up from a resting position. So she pressed on, determined to descend by the far slope, because she would carry this sword to its destiny. <nl> A ranger by the name of Boris was scaling the mountain peaks when he came across the unpleasant sight of a downed climber. It wasn't the first, but it pained him all the same. Why did amateurs try to pass through here alone? Further, why take a heavy and unnecessary payload as a broadsword strapped to one's back? <nl> He touched the crimson metal, then hastily withdrew as though it were a hot iron. In an instant, he knew what he had to do. <eos>

<sos> It's funny, most species start out incredibly social. But as they advance in technology, some members of society start to become more and more isolated. The reclusive scholars, the wise hermits, the silent religious types and so on. And as society grew and grew, so did the amount and types of social inept lonesome people who would only rarely interact with other beings face to face. And as society eventually reaches a point where interaction with other living beings for the sake of anything becomes unnecessary, then eventually all social individuals sort of die out. Slowly, but surely. Soon, computers would replace parties, face-to-face interaction would be more and more infrequent, to the point where children would not even see their parents, being raised by nanny robots. Thus it had always been. <nl> And yet, one race had bucked the trend. While they did indeed have socially inept and awkward people among them, their numbers were not growing exponentially as other races had at that point of technological development. The many races of the galaxy, who had only ever really interacted via text and a few brave enough to still play an MMO, had gathered the most social of their members to gather the necessary confidence to attempt contact. <nl> Of course, by most social, it meant people just brave enough to video chat, which was considered by most of the galactic community to be only something the most extremely social butterflies(technically they called them social Edt'quals but that wouldn't translate as well) would dare to engage in. There was an Ofei, a race which looked similar in appearance to bipedal squids, by the name of Desqa who had actually managed to leave the house to get the alien version of pizza, risking being seen or worse, meeting someone in the streets. There was an unnaturally tall bird-like thing which had, if rumors were correct, actually held a conversation as long as 15 minutes with another sentient life-form. The other sentient life-form had shortly after died from stress. And many others who, calling in with holograms, were gathered to find out who'd have to try to contact these extremely social sentients. Which went poorly. It took three months before anyone worked up the courage to say hi. And another two months before anyone dared reply. <nl> One might wonder how they would not have regressed mentally at this point, as would be most likely. Due to the fact that they constantly conversed with NPCs in their video games or dated simulated creatures in their visual novels, or even just read their many many books, they could still stay just social enough to not cease having a need for higher brain functions. And if that wasn't enough, then the wonders of genetic engineering could fix anything. <nl> After five years of awkward conversation, several people who had died from the sheer stress of being forced to socially interact and more awkward cringy conversations than you could realistically shake a stick at, the alien to contact the human race had been chosen. Alqir, a vaguely grey, bipedal, female lizard-like alien from the Qualqi race, had been chosen, though perhaps the more apt term was that she lost the large scale multiplayer game first that they had decided to have in order to determine the chosen one. She was quite literally shaking as her ship started its descent. She had been social, sure, often posting on social media, playing multiplayer games, actually managing to wave to someone once. But meeting an entirely new race, and one still capable of the mythical arts of social interaction, face to face, IRL! It was not something she was looking forward to. <nl> It hadn't been hard to send the text message to the humans, that they were going to be greeted by an official from the Galactic Independent Alliance. She wrapped her arms around herself, trying to think of what her characters in her games would do in such a situation. At least they breathed the same air as her, and they didn't look too weird for aliens. She just hoped there wouldn't be a crowd. She'd probably die, right there and then. The ship landed slowly, and she gulped as she walked reluctantly to the ship doors. ''*It's ok. I can do this.*'' She kept trying to tell herself, but it wasn't much use, her two hearts beating as if they were about to explode. She got up on the escalator and opened the doors. <nl> It was far worse than she could have felt in her worst nightmares. She had feared that maybe there would be more than ten of them. She was certain that there was more than ten thousand of them, all staring at her. She just froze, as the platform she was standing on descended down the giant escalator. She was screaming internally as she came closer to the humans on the podium. Especially the one in the center, almost twice as tall as her, with a broad smile, looking directly at her. Why was he so strangely handsome, for an alien? The platform finally stopped, and for a moment, everything was silent. <nl> And then the tall human walked towards her, reaching out his hand. In a form of trance, she shook as she extended her own claw. As he came close, he grasped her claw in his hand, and she looked up at him with wide, terrified eyes. And then, the human spoke. He sounded like everything she wasn't, confident, strong, proud. ''*I've been told you people have translation devices, that will make you understand everything I say. I must say, it's... A great honor to be here today, as the President of these United States of America, I, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, welcome you to our world, and extend to you a branch of peace, from the human race to the galaxy at large.*'' She just held his warm hand and was struck by panic. Her internal monologue was not entirely coherent, but as she noticed that the handsome alien had stopped talking a while ago, she realized it was getting a bit awkward. She opened her mouth, and stammered and tried to look away. ''*I... I... Thank you? I'm sorry. Uh. I... Uh. I come in... Peace.*'' That was what she said. Her internal thought process said something else. ''*ARRRGH! You're ruining this! Arrgggh! Nobody told me their leader was hot! There are no conversation prompts to get me to know how to interact with him!*'' At that moment, however, a realization struck her. In the dating sims she sometimes played, one would give gifts to the hot hero or colleague to increase their affection. She quickly let go of the human's hand and grabbed something from her pocket. ''*Uh... Here.*'' She handed him a metal figurine of one of her own characters that she had gotten 3D-printed once. The human smiled and looked somewhat puzzled as to what to do with this overly muscled small statue of a lizardman. She then realized she hadn't even introduced herself yet. ''*I'm... I mean, my name is... Uh... I am uh... Doctor Alqir, special enbooi, no I mean envoy! From the Galactic... uh Independent Alliance.*'' She knew she would get into so much trouble when this went badly. But then a female human, also remarkable to look at, walked towards them, and whispered something in the ear of the male that she could not quite make out. ''*May I invite you inside the White House to talk further?*'' The male inquired. Grasping at this hope to get away from the crowd, she nodded imperceptibly. The woman gently took her hand, and led Alqir down into a building, which was indeed very white. Led into a small room, it was just Alqir, the male and the female. <nl> ''*You're not good with crowds dear.*'' The woman said. Alqir shook, and began to cry. Stunned, the woman looked at her mate, and enveloped Alqir in her arms. It was the most wonderful feeling Alqir had ever had. ''*Shh. It's going to be okay. Just... let it out.*'' This continued for almost ten minutes where the woman comforted the small alien woman. The male looked somewhat uncomfortable with the crying. ''*Now, we need to talk a little, do you think you can do that?*'' The woman asked. Alqir nodded and looked up at the woman. ''*I'm Jacqueline Kennedy, but you can call me Jackie. You've already met my husband, John. Were you expecting something, a bit different.*'' Alqir, still quietly sobbing, just nodded. Through the next few hours, Jackie and John managed to coax out an explanation of what had happened, of how the galaxy worked. How almost everyone were so anti-social, some people didn't even believe in the existence of other people. After Alqir had calmed down, and she felt a little better, they also started doing some of the official actions needed for mankind to enter the Galactic world, some star systems for them to claim, what kind of technology they would be given to help them. <eos>

<sos> She glanced up at the face that looked oddly familiar. The dragon's golden eye was fixated on her, little puffs of smoke coming from its snout from the exertion of flying. <nl> It had landed at her doorstep, fire red wings creating small dust tornadoes in its wake, inadvertently dirtying the welcome mat she had just laid back outside. <nl> Rina wiped her hands on her apron, then approached. Perhaps she should have feared the dragon, such a monstrous creature it was, ten feet tall and with claws the size of a small car. But she had seen the star shaped divot on its head, and she knew. <nl> And so she stood at her doorstep, waiting for the friend who had left so many years ago to speak. When the dragon did speak, her voice was smooth and baritone, belying the toughness of her scales and of her past. <nl> Star had been just two weeks old when Rina found her, crying for her mother in a field. How she had gotten there, Rina still wasn't quite sure, but ignoring her husband's demands that she kill the vile creature, she had instead raised it in secret. <nl> For three months, her hands had been covered in claw and tooth marks, and they had made their indelible mark as small, raised white ridges, scars that stood the test of time, on her hands. Hundreds of baby bottles with tiny fang holes in them and ninety days of waking up in the middle of the night to wailing cries for meat later, Star had finally become old enough to hunt for herself. By this time, she was the size of a large dog, and she often took pleasure in chasing the cats around the old barnyard. <nl> Rina, Star cried. <nl> "Star," she said simply. There was no more need for words; the two had forged that bond long ago, even though they hadn't spoken for years now. It was what naturally came when the universe narrowed itself down to two points, wrapped in each other's existence as if they couldn't exist without the other. <nl> At first, Star would come back once a year, and they would sit together, woman and dragon, side by side, watching the dawn. Their meetings were fleet, and she would be gone with the sunrise. Dragons were savage by nature, forgetting their parents once they've been weaned; motherhood was a bond forged from necessity and biology, not care. <nl> But one year, Star hadn't come back. Rina had assumed--nay, expected--the worst. Hunters abounded plenty these days, and dragon pelts were worth a fortune. <nl> So this visit was welcome. Truly welcome. She laid a hand on Star's foreleg. And knew she couldn't stay long as the muscles under her hand rippled with tension, even as the dragon's eyes gazed up at the skies, then into the wheat fields. Trigger happy neighbors made for short visits. <nl> Slowly, Star unfolded a wing to reveal a baby creature, its eyes not yet open, wings and scaleless body still covered in egg fluid. It wailed pitifully, grasping at the scaly surface with a pruny wing that had a claw at the end. Although, it was so small it might have been mistaken for a tooth. As soon as Rina took it within her hands, cradling it, Star took off, heavy wing beats carrying her into the blue. More than a responsibility, she knew the small dragonling was a symbol of trust. <nl> Rina named the dragonling Hope. Hope that it might survive against the odds. Hope that it might live to cherish its second chance at life. Hope that, one day, her dragons might return alive and well, their wings claiming the sky. <nl> ***** <nl> For fantasy and more <nl> r/AlannaWu <eos>

<sos> ######[](#dropcap) <nl> It was one of those surreal moments that you only get to experience once in life. <nl> Linda was working on the script for the next show when her phone began to buzz. Slowly at first, just a couple messages. Work friends, she thought. Thursday was always their night out for drinks, but she had been too busy tonight to join them. <nl> Then the buzzing became more rapid, until her phone began vibrating constantly on the bed. With a frown, she glanced at the messages that were popping up quickly, one after another. They were all from random numbers, all sending the exact same message. She scrolled through, just to make sure she wasn't missing something. <nl> "It's a beautiful night tonight. Look outside." <nl> A frisson of fear ran down her spine. After a minute, the messages slowed down. Then a singular message, different from the previous ones. <nl> "DO NOT LOOK OUT YOUR WINDOW." <nl> It was from her boyfriend, Jordan. Her mind reeled. This had to be some kind of joke. She'd been such a good girl. She never went to abandoned houses and never walked into creepy forests alone. She was always sure to lock her windows and doors at night. <nl> So with hesitant steps, she walked toward the dark curtain that was covering her window. Slowly, she reached out a hand and flicked off the lamp on her desk so that her room became pitch dark. It would help, at least, if whatever was out there couldn't see in. Then, she slowly slid open the curtain and peeked outside, expecting the worst. Perhaps a killer clown or a ghost. <nl> She squinted. Was that...Jordan? <nl> Without hesitating, she ran toward her bedroom door, throwing it open, and dashed down the steps of her apartment until she was at the bottom. There, she watched as her boyfriend was desperately trying to bring down the small hot air balloon that he had somehow managed to raise a little ways from her window. <nl> He glanced down at her, then ducked into the basket. She simply stood there, waiting for him to get down. When the balloon came close enough, she saw the sign plastered to the front, and burst out into laughter. <nl> On the front of the balloon, in large bold, flowery lettering, were the words: <nl> LINDA, WILL YOU MARY ME? <nl> When the hot air balloon touched down, Jordan climbed out, his face bunched up. "I told them not to send the messages, but it was too late when I noticed the typo--I'm going to kill Erin by the way--and everyone has such quick reflexes-" <nl> Linda simply laughed and cut him off, throwing herself into his arms. "The answer's yes, in case you were wondering." <nl> Jordan froze for a moment before he hugged her tight, lifting her up and spinning her around in the air. Then, huffing and puffing, he set her down, breaking out in a large smile as he gazed her windswept hair and freckles. "Best girlfriend ever," he said softly. <nl> "Best fiancee ever," she corrected, and tilted his face so they could look at the moon together. "You have great timing, by the way. It's a full moon tonight." <nl> "I meant to do that," he said, and kissed her on the forehead. Then he pulled out his phone. <nl> "Mission success," he typed into the group chat, and ignored the kissy faces that flooded in. He would get revenge on Erin tomorrow, he vowed, his face dark. But at least, he thought, this would be a tale to tell the grandkids. <nl> ***** <nl> r/AlannaWu <eos>

<sos> **My(37M) wife(34F) has been looking through videos and has found that our son (7) only speaks one word in each video. The words in order of the videos seem to make a sentence. She thinks our son is trying to tell us something. Like a warning. Help!** <nl> My wife has been all over this Facebook thing. Recently she has be insistent that we delete all of our data on Facebook and transfer it to a Zip drive via email. She has been going through the videos and pictures doing a delete and keep. She has finished up all of the pics and has moved on to the videos. The thing is our son's videos seem to be different than the rest and only for the past few months. For instance up until about two months ago he would talk like every other kid his age now he only speaks one word while looking at the camera. Then he runs away or he starts playing again. <nl> My wife being the best woman in the world has gone through them and seems to be  going crazy. She thinks he is trying to tell us something. She has decided to write down every word from every video he is in when the one word videos started. <nl> So far she has the words: *mom, and, dad, you, need, to, listen, to, me, we, are, all, in, grave, danger, they, are, coming, for, us, they, are, coming* <nl> My wife thinks honestly that he is telling us or warning us of something. I don't know what to believe. Is he a warning us or have we just caught him mid sentence or we didn't catch the entire conversation. <nl> The part about my wife that is also troubling is, she has taken this to heart. She actually thinks he is warning us and has began to be a little paranoid. She has spent countless hours and days looking at the videos and rewatching them. She has been on detective mode. It is putting a strain on our relationship. When it could be something else. It's getting pretty bad. <nl> So fellow redditors what do I do? Do I take this as a ominous warning or do I get my wife help? I think my wife is going crazy. <nl> TL;DR: wife has been going through videos from Facebook and has found videos of our son saying just one word. She has put the words in order and it seems to come out as a sentence. It's straining our marriage. Is my wife going crazy. <nl> Edit: thanks for all the comments. I am going to talk to her and get her away from the videos. Maybe a nice date and take the kids to the park. <nl> Edit 2: Date went nice. I was able to convince her to stop with the videos and that it could really be anything. <nl> Edit 3:  while at the park we were videoing the kids our son came up and said *today* to the camera and ran way. What does that even mean? Now my wife is freaking out and pulled out the list of words from her purse. She has given me the new sentence. She is crying. <nl> New sentence: *mom, and, dad, you, need, to, listen, to, me, we, are, all, in, grave, danger, they, are, coming, for, us, they, are, coming, today* <nl> What am I going to do? She thinks this means people are coming for us today. <nl> Edit 4: several men have pulled up to the house in white vans. <nl> I'll keep you updated if anything happens. <eos>

<sos> "There's dinner dearies!" the coven cackled unanimously as they peered into a cauldron, and within the cauldron was the image of a lone child wandering in the woods. <nl> "Shall we set a traaaaap?" Merva enquired, licking her lips at the thought of being wicked. It had been some time since they had laid a trap for a child. Most of the time they were completely unnecesary, but Merva was particularly cruel. <nl> "No, no, always on about the traps. Mayhap we should trap you Merva? Would that please you? NO! We will don our prettiest forms and coerce the child to our hovel, as we always have." This was said by Jerva, the self-proclaimed Head-Hag of the sisters. She had the majority of the brains, which is really nothing to brag about. But the fact stood. <nl> "Why do we have to do it your way, every time Jervaaaa?" Merva had a penchant for carrying on syllables for far to long. She was a model of charm, naturally. <nl> "Because my way has kept us alive and safe for over 300 years. That's why. Now lets be on our way!" Jerva's form changed from a twisted greenskin hobbler to that of a young teenage girl, dressed in an unassuming robe. She looked like any common peasant, someone who you would not suspect cause you any harm. She had started out the door when... <nl> "What about Tervaaaa? Doesn' she have a saaaaaaay? Merva looked at Jerva with a shit-eating grin. Terva glared at Merva. Terva was a mute, due to an unfortunate accident some 80 years ago. Without a word Jerva went out in the forest to meet the child, her sisters considerably more pretty and far younger than they had been not 30 seconds ago hustling behind her. <nl> Enter the child. <nl> "Do ye find yourself lost, child?" the polymorphed hags descended on the child with an eagerness that most would find peculiar, but the child did not appear to notice. <nl> 'Yes'm I been separated from me ma and pa! Could you madams help me find me ma an pa?" The voice was that of a little girl, perhaps 8 or 9. Between the declining sunlight and the hood she wore, her features were nearly imperceptible. Merva was greedily rubbing her hands together, anxious to take the girl home. After all, not only did little girls taste best, they could be used to make potions of youth. Only Terva noticed something different about this child. A faint but still noticeable aura emanated from this child. One that made her skin crawl. Alas, she was mute and no way to communicate such a feeling. After all, her sisters hadn't mentinoed anything. <nl> "It's getting awfully late, child. Do you find it acceptable to come home with us this evening and we begin the search for your parents in the morning?" Jerva felt sly, conning the child into such a seemingly generous offer. How could the child refuse? <nl> "I d'no if me parents would take kindly to the idea.." The little girl trailed off, now backing away slightly from the hidden hags. She seemed fearful and off put, Jerva knew she was losing her and had to think fast. <nl> "Wha.. What are your parents names little one? Jerva was impressed by her sharp wit, for she had a plan. Merva, though lacking in brains, also caught on to the plan. She chimed in "Yes! We may know theeem!" Jerva smacked Merva in the side sharply with her left hand, so that the child wouldn't notice. The smack indicated that now was not the time for Merva to speak, or act for that matter, on account of her queer demeanor. <nl> "Me family name is Heronomus, mayhaps you've heard it?" The child asked rather calmly. There was nothing else to note. <nl> "Why, Heronomus you say? Yes! Yes! You live two or three miles from here! We can take you in the morning, little one!" Jerva was herself becoming excited. Her plan was working, the child seemed to be more trusting after the confirmation of knowing her parents. Now to return home. <nl> "Seeing as ye know me ma n pa, I sees no reason not to go with ye. Do ye have any food? Haven eaten all day.." The little girl asked almost shyly. <nl> "Of course we will feed you, sweet one! Come with us, the moon is rising and we must be in soon. Strange creatures lurk these woods at night." <nl> The sisters turned, in the direction of home, motioning the child to follow. The three hags shared a smile as they walked single file along the barely lit path, owing what little visibility there was to the ever growing moon. What the hags did not know was that there was in fact a fourth smile caught glinting in the lunar light. <nl> Enter the cottage. <nl> Upon entering the cottage the hags waited for the child to enter before reverting back to their original selves. With magic only witches know, the closed all the windows, locked the singular door, and lit the sconces lined along the oval room. The cauldron in the center of the room bubbled, eager for a human. The cauldron would be disappointed, tonight. <nl> "Ahehehe! Your in trouble sweeeeeeeet one!" Merva could contain herself no longer, and began casting lesser incantations, her desire to lull the child to sleep. A sleeping child is better than a dead one, for it preserves the flavor and life force. <nl> Terva and Jerva began their preparations for the bubble bath (the cauldron was boiling) paying no mind to their sister. She had put many, many victims to sleep. It was her favorite part of the ritual, as a matter of fact. <nl> "She isn't falling asleep!" Merva shrieked, increasing the force of her magic, frustrated that this seemingly weak child could resist her in the slightest. The other hags glanced over their shoulders as the child lowered her hood. Raven black hair. Sanguine eyes. Skin the color of winter's first snow. <nl> Enyo beamed a bright smile, revealing her fangs. She appeared to be a child, and in some ways she was. But only physically. Enyo, in terms of age, made these hags seems like children. She was in fact, one of the first Vampire to exist. She had seen empire rise and fall, met the so called Gods. So why was she here? In this cottage? Well, it's simple really. <nl> She was a slave who was given to a Vampire to be his thrall, so as to pay off a debt owed. The one who sold her? None other than a witch. Thus, her hatred of witches caused her to seek out the monsters, and, well... you know how this ends. <nl> The moon shone red that night. <eos>

<sos> The child ambled through the forest, excited, delighted. <nl> She heard laughter echo across the trees, and she turned to see three witches hunched over a cauldron, eyeing her with hunger. <nl> "What have we here?" one witch said, her left eye swiveling on its own accord. "A lost little child, no parents in sight?" <nl> "I don't have any parents," the child responded. <nl> "Oh, another orphan, lost in the woods," another witch said with a smile. "You must be deathly cold. Why don't you climb into our cauldron to warm up?" <nl> "I'm fine, thank you very much," the child replied, "I think it's quite full." <nl> "Nonsense child," the third responded, "You shouldn't question adults." <nl> "*And you shouldn't eat children*," the child said, her tone lowering, "but here we are." <nl> The witches cackled, their calloused fingers slapping the cauldron. "You sure are fearless," the witch said, "but that won't save you. You are lucky we just ate, else you would be cooking already. We can have our banter." <nl> "Who was in that cauldron?" the girl asked. <nl> "One as little as you," another witch replied with a cough. "A brash little boy, if you must know. Lost in the woods, crying all the while." <nl> The girl smiled. "And you ate him?" <nl> "Just as we will you, deary," the witch said, "just as we will you." The right side of her face began to droop. <nl> "How did he taste?" <nl> The witch tried to snatch the little girl, but she lost her footing and had to grab onto her staff to keep herself from falling. <nl> "Horrible, if you must know," the witch spat, her words slurring, her vision blurring. <nl> "I'm not surprised," the girl replied, walking towards the witches. "The poison is really quite bitter." <nl> "Pois-son?" the witch said, loosing her footing and falling against the burning cauldron, her skin scalding. The girl nodded. <nl> "He was always so mean to us and the others," the girl said, taking the wand from the witch. "Every orphanage has one of them." <nl> The final witch collapsed. "You... poisoned a child... knowing we would..?" <nl> "Oh, yes," the child replied, as the witch began to convulse. <nl> "And I'll make much better witches than you, I think you'll find." <nl> **** <nl> ***** <nl> If you didn't completely hate that, consider subscribing to [my subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/) <nl> I'll try add new (and old) stories every day <3 <eos>

<sos> Twenty days. Less than a month. Less than a month, and everything was so different. Some days, it was hard to even remember how it had been before. <nl> The wood groaned softly as she shifted, so she froze in the darkness. She'd stayed out too long, and had to hide in an overturned wagon. She could see the outline of the house- all the lights were off. But, she'd waited too long, and now it was dark. She blinked several times to stop the tears forming, and tried to choke down the panic rising in her chest. Too damn long. Stupid, stupid, stupid. She inhaled slowly, and tried to regulate her breathing. It was hard not to instinctually breath too shallow, in an attempt to stay as quiet as possible. <nl> Gingerly, she reached a trembling hand up to the top of her head and gently slid the goggles down over her eyes. The world flickered back into focus, albeit, in black and white. Was that- yes, Dad was standing out front of the door. Could he see her? It looked like he had his gogg- she stifled a sigh of relief as he slowly put a hand up to his side in a fist. Stay put. He could see her, or at least knew where she was. Why had she waited so damn long? <nl> It was so silent out that her heartbeat sounded like thunder in her ears. Rationally, she knew that wasn't the case, but it was more difficult than one would think to quench the fear that you were being too conspicuous. A malicious presence, heavy on the air, slowly settled around her, and things somehow became even more still. Something was wrong. She realized she was holding her breath, and forced herself to breathe slowly and deeply while staring at Dad, who had also frozen, not even raising his gun. Something was very wrong. <nl> The back of her neck began to pickle and tingle, as her subconscious brain alerted her to something nearby. She'd learned to listen to that feeling over the past few weeks. Something was wrong, and she could feel it in the air. Her stomach felt like a brick of ice, and her skin had a chill, despite it being a warm summer night. She was afraid to even turn her head, or move her now tingling leg. Why had she settled in such a stupid position? Stupid, stupid, stupid. <nl> She couldn't tear her eyes off of her father until Devin's head slowly bobbed into view on the roof to his left. What- he smoothly slung a long, slim object off of his shoulder, and appeared to lay down. The rifle. This was bad. Somehow, worse than she'd thought. Bad things never seemed real until perspective was forced. This was very bad. <nl> She'd never been more terrified in her life. She could hardly breath, eyes locked on the house, and her father, who was frozen stock still. She could feel a malicious presence, somehow. She didn't know where it was, or even really, what it was. But it was there. And, it knew she was, too. Dead silence. Dad's hand slowly opened, turned, and made a slow beckoning gesture. <nl> No. She wanted to cry. No, no, no. No way. It was too far. No. No. Her lip trembled as she slowly reached back and tightened her backpack straps. She froze. She felt like prey. This must be what mice in those old science videos felt like right before being eaten alive by a snake. She was paralyzed with fear. No. She felt like her bones were cold- she, unhyperbolically, was bone-chillingly terrified. That was a new sensation. No. <nl> Dad's gesture became quicker, and she saw Devin shift slightly toward the top of her peripheral vision. No. The feeling of hateful fear was almost overwhelming, now. She could feel it, pressing down on her, from all sides. She'd stayed out way too long. Something was so, so wrong. She was too far. She was too far. Stupid. Stupid, stupid. Her body was shaking. Fear, or adrenaline, she couldn't tell, probably both. <nl> Dad's whole hand was flapping urgently now. They needed the medicine. Worth the risk, they'd decided. But that was then, and it'd been too far. She felt like her eyelids were peeling back, and she was paralyzed. She felt as if a massive weight was crushing her chest, like she was stuck in a giant vice. Her body was trembling like a mouse, and she couldn't stop. Too long. She felt like prey. Stupid. She was prey. No. No. <nl> Dad beckoned urgently with his whole arm, then raised his gun. Now. Now, she had to go now. If she was going to go, it had to be now. Devin's a good shot. Dad's got a pump. Now's the time. No. No, no, no. The wagon creaked slightly as she hurled herself to her feet. Three hundred yards, max. <nl> Her legs were churning faster than they ever had before. State semifinalist, twice in a row. The wind roared by her ears, as she veritably flew towards the house. Joey had clocked her at twenty three once, last year. Her feet were barely touching the ground- she felt so light. Her fear made her legs pump even harder. Closer. She was rapidly closing. She felt like something was right behind her. <nl> All she could hear was the wind. All she could see was a blur of white and gray, and the pitch black opening of the door. And Dad. And Dad? Sprinting towards her, raising the gun and- BOOM. Devin had shot the rifle. This was bad, this was so bad. BOOM. Again. <nl> BOOM. Dad fired the shotgun off to her right. People were yelling, now. Dad. She couldn't hear, or understand them. BOOM. A third shot from the rifle, and she felt a blast and a whistle a few feet to the left of her head. So close. Waited too long. She pumped her arms and legs as fast and hard as she could. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. <nl> One hundred yards. BOOM. She heard a muffled, animalistic grunt behind her, and finally all the fear she'd been keeping clamped inside bubbled out. BOOM. She screamed. BOOM. <nl> BOOM. BOOM. She was so close, nearly out of her mind in terror. BOOM. Nothing existed except the door. BOOM, BOOM. Someone screamed. She realized that it wasn't her. BOOM, BOOM. BOOM. Someone screamed from another direction. BOOM. She screamed, and flung herself across the threshold, diving over the couch. <nl> Silence. She huddled behind the couch, shaking in fear. Dead silence. Slowly, she sat up and peaked over the edge of the couch, to the open door. Dad? Where was he? That door needed to be closed. She wouldn't leave them, though. They hadn't left her. It was so still, suddenly. She gently slid the backpack off, and got into a squat to go check the door. <nl> A massive shape blackened the door opening, as it silently moved inside. No. The door creaked softly as it closed. Took too damn long. The door clicked shut. Stupid, stupid, stupid. <nl> Edit: a word <nl> Edit 2: another word to clarify Devin's location <eos>

<sos> Caesar crumpled to his knees, clothes red, life ebbing into the floor around him. <nl> He tried to inhale and instead felt the unstoppable torrent of blood clogging his mouth. His voice failed him. <nl> He was dying. Again. <nl> Craning his neck up, he saw the next attack coming before it embedded itself in his chest. The handle of a dagger, golden, embellished with a myriad of jewels and gemstones, came into Caesar's vision, just below his heart. <nl> The dagger he'd given to his most trusted ally. <nl> "Et tu, Brute?" <nl> The now blurring figure of Brutus attempted to look somber. They failed, a smile breaking their lips. <nl> *'I should've known*', Caesar thought to himself. <nl> Brutus - no, *Aegis* - leaned in close to her lifelong foe, pressing her lips to his ear. *Her ear.* <nl> "I win, my dear Eve." <nl> ----- <nl> "It seems my cover has been blown," Queen Elizabeth muttered, kicking up a cloud of ash with her foot. The simple motion sent a spasm of pain through her spine. <nl> Eve hated the Queen's form; old, decrepit, ostensibly every bit as unrelenting in dying as she was. <nl> 91 fucking years of marching towards death's door, never quite able to open it. <nl> Aegis - *or, rather, Betty White* - quirked a brow, a rare look of surprise crossing her features. <nl> "My, my. That's quite the bit you've got yourself. I never would've guessed. Honest to God. You have a thing for monarchs, don't you?" <nl> Elizabeth rubbed the scar under her heart. "Power gets me things I want," she said blankly. <nl> "Like daggers in the chest?" <nl> "It has its shortcomings." <nl> "I was genuinely surprised you survived that time, really. I'd been pretty damn thorough. Even went and celebrated." <nl> Elizabeth grinned sheepishly. "*Please.* We've both been through worse. Remember Romeo and Juliet?" <nl> "Oh, Christ, that's the last time I'm pretending to kill myself on your behalf." Betty chuckled breezily, sitting herself down with a slight hiss of pain. <nl> Elizabeth copied, sitting opposite her on the ground. "Gods, these forms are pathetic. What can a hag of a monarch do without subjects to command?" <nl> "Complain, evidently." <nl> "Screw you." <nl> "I *told* you to not remind me of Romeo and Juliet." <nl> Elizabeth snickered, clicking her shoulders as she leaned back and forth. "Hey, our little shenanigans made for a pretty good play." <nl> "Two of them, *Caesar*." Betty stared at her partner pointedly. <nl> "I don't like to think about that one. Makes me cry every time." <nl> "The pain or the fact I played you like a puppet?" <nl> "Both, really." <nl> Betty clicked her tongue, holding up a hand as she fumbled through her inner-pockets. After an age, she produced two small vials, laying them on the ground between her and Elizabeth. <nl> "Look, Liz - *Eve* - I know we've been at it for quite some time, so long I've forgotten all that matters. Even the thought of killing you has lost its novelty at this point." <nl> "I'm flattered." <nl> "But the fact is we both want the same thing. Truly. What else could we ask for after so many years?" <nl> Elizbeth didn't take her eyes off the vials, the creases in her forehead becoming prominent as she furrowed her brows. "This *can't* possibly be your new way of tricking me." <nl> "Look me in the eyes and tell me we don't want the same thing." <nl> Elizabeth met her rival's unyielding gaze. In that moment, she felt wearier than she'd ever done before; as if every year, century and millennia she'd suffered all caught up to her at once. <nl> She keeled over, clenching her fists as a violent cough shook her body. <nl> "Our curse," Betty muttered, her expression morose. "The sad fact is, I don't think we can die in competition. Time has proven it an innumerable amount of times." <nl> "Then *how?*" Elizbeth lurched forward, grabbing Betty by the collar. "How the fuck can this all end, Aegis?! I'm tired. I'm weak. I've experienced every pleasure there is in existence, every form of suffering one can imagine; torture, heartbreak, betrayal, love, you name it. All of it with the hope that one day, one distant, singular, moment in the future, I'd be able to end it all. And you're telling me it'll never happen?" <nl> Elizabeth let go of Betty, slumping against the ground, her face collapsing into the dirt. <nl> "You and I both, Sister." <nl> Elizabeth let out a low chuckle, although the sound was bitter. "That's a new one." <nl> "Your existential dread has helped breed a little kinship, let us say." <nl> "*Dread* doesn't do it justice. Children dread the boogeyman. Adults dread unemployment and filing tax returns. I don't think there's any word that can explain what it really is. Nobody else has lived long enough to make it." <nl> "You're a real bore when you're like this, you know that?" <nl> "It's a side effect of life." <nl> "If you can call this one." <nl> "A *shitty* life. An everlife. An ever-shitty-life." <nl> Betty had to try her best to not reach out and strangle Eve. "Look, Eve, I didn't say we *can't die*. We can. Just not the way you might've envisioned it. I'm afraid to say there'll be no grand finale for us." <nl> Elizabeth tilted her head to look at Betty. Her eyes were watery and bloodshot. "I'll say it again. *How?*" <nl> Betty picked up one of the vials on the ground, unscrewed its cork, and held it out to Elizabeth. "*Together.* At each other's hand. Not from hatred, nor revenge, or suicide. Gods know we've tried. But as the one being we are; two birds of a feather, the sides of a coin. For as long as one of us draws breath, so will the other. And, no, I'm not intentionally referencing your favourite ill-fated couple here." <nl> Elizabeth straightened up and took the vial, clasping it in her hands. Betty picked up the other, unscrewing it as well. <nl> "How do I know this isn't another ploy?" Elizabeth asked as she rested her own above her lips. It was ridiculous for Betty to think she could build trust on a foundation as lofty as their relationship. And now of all times. <nl> Betty shook her head, pulling forward Elizabeth's hand so that the vial was instead near herself. "I said it before. We've both faced the tribulations of immortality. We made a game of it for a time, sure, but there's nothing to laugh at here. This is it. Freedom." <nl> Betty moved her own vial forwards, locking her arm around Elizabeth's. She gulped, her arm shaking. <nl> *Freedom*. The word, in all of her years, had almost lost all meaning to Elizabeth. At the beginning, it had quite literally costed her heaven, her wings, all notions of happiness, scarce as they were. Beyond that, so many lives had been lost in revolutions staked on that vacuous idea, countless more in the pursuit of personal liberty, and, of course, she knew that hope was the greatest plague of them all for both mortals and immortals alike. What was it all for? <nl> That was life, she'd concluded. A ceaseless, ridiculous practice in futility. A wish for change that never came. <nl> "Freedom," she said, just for the pleasure of hearing it. "Maybe there's an afterlife." <nl> "For us? Probably not." <nl> "I hope there isn't one," Elizabeth said. <nl> "As do I." <nl> Elizabeth gave Betty a quizzical look, reassessing the woman she'd known for so many lifetimes. "God, I hate myself for believing you right now." <nl> "I know." <nl> "You better not be lying." <nl> "I promise." <nl> "*Ha*, good one." <nl> Elizabeth bit her quivering lip, tilting her head back. <nl> Betty mirrored the motion. "Not with a bang, but with a whimper," Betty whispered, a girlish grin on her features. <nl> "Fitting," Elizabeth echoed. The world was so quiet, but for the two of them. <nl> Together, Eve and Aegis tossed back the contents of each vial. <nl> Together, they collapsed to the ground. <nl> Together, the beat of their immortal hearts began to still. <nl> "*W- we've won*," Eve said, tears streaking her eyes as she reached out to clasp her sister's hand. "*So many fucking years...*" <nl> Aegis clutched her sister tightly, unable to summon up the strength to respond. <nl> Seconds later, her grasp loosened. <nl> The world became silent. <eos>

<sos> ######[](#dropcap) <nl> The light came on. <nl> Rina froze, her foot poised above the stair step. She slowly stood up straight and turned around. Her mother, in all her bushy-haired, spectacled glory, stood there, hands crossed over her chest, glaring at her only daughter. <nl> "Where were you? And what are you wearing?" <nl> Rina gingerly pulled back the hood of her white cloak. "Nowhere, mom. And nothing." <nl> "You're coming in at 10 p.m. without even an 'I was practicing my incantations' explanation and you expect me to believe that?" Suddenly, she walked up, taking a corner of the cloak in her hand and examined the stitch work. "I recognize this pattern. This is the cloak the members of the church across town wear. You joined a clergy?" <nl> "No." She said, expressionless. <nl> Her mother blinked, then brought her hand up. A swirling ball of black mist slowly appeared within her palm, and before Rina's eyes, it began to take form, separating into little flickers of life. Rina's eye twitched. Finally, she broke down. <nl> "Okay, I was at the church!" <nl> Her mother had a terrible habit of conjuring up undead wasps whenever she was unhappy. If getting stung by a single wasp was bad, imagine getting stung by tens of undead wasps that couldn't be killed. Paddling had nothing on her mother. <nl> The ball of black mist disappeared. "Okay," Her mother picked up a large tome from the desk and made for her bedroom, her black cloak swishing behind her. <nl> "Wait, that's it?" The words popped out of her mouth unbidden. Not that she wanted to be punished, but she had thought her mother would have been completely against her joining the clergy. <nl> Her mother turned around. She shrugged. "That's it." <nl> "Wait. What?" <nl> Her mother blew on a fingernail, examining it. "I was going to ask Pastor Jeremiah to take you in anyway in a couple weeks time. Saved me the time and effort." <nl> "I thought you hated the clergy?" <nl> "Oh, good lord, no." She laughed at her little joke. "That's how I got my start. How can you understand death if you can't understand life? Besides, where do you think you were made?" <nl> Rina took a step back, bumping into the dining room chair. She definitely didn't want to know. She would probably be scarred for life. <nl> Her mother walked up anyway, and whispered the words next to her ear. <nl> "In the confession booth." <nl> Then, she strode into her bedroom and closed the door behind her, leaving Rina standing there, stock-still, wondering if she tore out her ears, if she could un-hear what she had just heard. <nl> ***** <nl> Parts 2,3 and 4 are now posted!

<sos> I stared at my mother in utter bewilderment. My thoughts were turning into an uncontrollable tempest, the first breeze in the storm being: Why does she do this to me every time? This was *my* moment, not hers! I reveal my deepest secret and she doesn't even blink an eye. That's so God-damned typical. <nl> Then the rest of the gale arrived, howling and hounding and chasing those initial thoughts away: Nerina Okareda, perhaps the most powerful Nercromancer alive, was once a cleric? A *cleric!* <nl> "Mom." That was all I could get out. The only word that would form on my lips. I wasn't sure if it was a question or a statement. "Mom." <nl> "Yes?" <nl> "I- I don't understand." <nl> "It was... a lifetime ago." <nl> "You were a cleric?" <nl> She sighed, as if thinking back was causing her pain. "Patience Lylet. That was my name, back when I was Caemor's cleric." <nl> "You were royal cleric to Caemor? The Mad King?" I sputtered. Caemor was the man we had been at war with since I'd been born. Since before that time. The man who knew nothing but hatred for mysticism and necromancy, or any of the darker arts. The man who had sentenced our brethren to life in the Ice Mines, and who had forced us to cower like criminals in the darkest recesses of the mountains. <nl> "You look indignant. Don't be. He wasn't always such a terrible man." <nl> I laughed. "You're kidding, right? Tell me you're kidding. He hunted down and enslaved over three million-" <nl> She raised a hand in the air, and as if I was a child again, I fell silent. I clenched my fist, more angry at myself than her. I couldn't wait to get out of this place. The monasteries had already agreed to my enrolment. This -- telling mom -- was just a formality. <nl> "He was not always bad. He... he had things happen to him, that changed him." <nl> "Good!" <nl> "You don't mean that, because you don't understand." <nl> "Are you kidding? Of course I mean it. Caemor can burn in the halls of Hell for eternity. <nl> "You weren't my first child." <nl> "What?" <nl> She paused a moment, considering. "Caemor and I, we had a child together. We called him Edulis." <nl> "I-- I have a brother?" <nl> "No. He is dead. He died before you were born." <nl> My head was pounding. I wasn't sure if I was angry at my mother for only telling me this now, or just confused. "How? How did he die?" <nl> "He began coughing up blood one afternoon. A little, to start with. But it got gradually worse as the weeks passed. I was not just his mother, but royal cleric. It was my responsibility to..." <nl> "You couldn't save him?" <nl> She shook her head. "There are limits to even the finest Cleric's abilities. Certainly, there were limits to mine. I could only prolong his life, keeping him confined to his bed, in terrible pain, for almost a year. I would have kept him alive forever, if I could have done so. Caemor however, ordered me to let him die. <nl> "That bastard!" <nl> "It wasn't easy for Caemor. Or for me. And I still don't know who was right. But, the next day, Edulis was dead. As was my love for Caemor. I resigned from my position and left the palace the same day, before my son's bones were even buried." <nl> "That's why he hates you? That's why there is this war? Because you left him? What a-" <nl> "No. It's because of what I took with me as I left." <nl> I paused. "What? What did you take?" <nl> My mother -- Nerina Okareda -- simply stared at me. <eos>

<sos> "What did you do?" He asked, watching the sun sink into the sea that stretched out before them, <nl> "I was a farm kid," She said, laughing melodically, "Feels almost unreal now," <nl> He smiled as the fading sun danced across her face, eyes focused so far ahead of him it made him dizzy, <nl> "I get that," He responded as he caught himself, "Its hard to imagine you wasting away in a field somewhere," <nl> "Oh it wasn't all bad," She said with forced cheer, "Studying just didn't feel that important back then, you know," <nl> He followed her gaze as best he could, watching the sun slowly disappear, "Yeah, I guess it didn't," <nl> She suddenly chuckled to herself, "My parents they," She smiled so warmly that she almost looked like a different person to him, "They used to always scold me for skipping school, forced me to work in the field with them." Her eyes seemed to drift away, "God I hated it back then," <nl> "But now?" His mouth asked before he could even think it, <nl> "Now?" She said, smiling sadly as she crushed the butt of her cigarette into the metal railing, "Now I'm terrified every day that I'll run back to them and not see the recognition in their eyes as they look back," <nl> "They're still alive?" He asked in disbelief, "How," <nl> "Car crash," She intercepted, "I was old enough to drive and to drink, and those things don't mix well," <nl> He looked at her and suddenly felt indescribably sad thinking back on his own former life, rich and full and long. That, he realized, made him one of the lucky ones, <nl> "Different life gramps," She said with a sad smile, punching him playfully on the arm, "It was good while it lasted, and that's what matters, right?" <nl> "Right," He said as she left him standing there, looking on as the sun disappeared fully into the dark ocean, the salty breeze licking away at his face, "While it lasted," <eos>

<sos> Juliet lay silent, forcing herself to control her breathing. Gently. Slowly. She had to calm down. <nl> It wasn't meant to have happened like this. Whether the King annexed Tushesh or not, it wasn't her decision. It had just been her idea. A good idea too, as it would provide much needed access to the East-Sea, and open the trade routes with the bearded men of Asnar. And much more, besides. <nl> > Juliet felt something against her back. It was like someone had shoved her hard, and she almost fell as she stumbled forward. <nl> There were, as expected, many opponents to the idea. The Tushesh fundamentalists, of course. They believed their tiny kingdom had the right to autonomous self-sovereignty. That was incorrect. No one had a given right to anything. *Steel*. The blades and the people who wielded them, that was what gave kingdoms their right. <nl> > She turned. Behind her was only the distant tree-line of the Elder Forest. No person, that she could see. <nl> > A glimmer near her feet caught her eye. She looked down to see an object shining orange, reflecting the evening sun. <nl> > The arrow lay flat on the grass, harmlessly. Innocently. <nl> There were others that opposed it, too. People from within their own kingdom, who didn't believe that it was right to take land from other countries just for personal gain. Those too, who thought that holding onto the country would be an impossibility if the people of Tushesh did not want it. There would forever be resistance. Infighting. Violence. And how much money would it take to quell them? <nl> These people, she knew, had a point. <nl> > The man stepped out of the trees, his hands by his side. He had dark skin and blue eyes and Juliet was certain he was foreign. There was a bow strapped over his back. <nl> > "Who are you?" Juliet shouted. "Did you... Why didn't it hurt me?" <nl> > "I can't hurt you," replied the man. He stared into her eyes as he approached. He looked sad. Pained, in fact. More pained than anyone she had ever seen. <nl> > Juliet swallowed. "You mean..." She'd heard stories but... it couldn't be real. <nl> Yes, the people would resist. So Juliet suggested razing the cites of Tushesh completely. And its people. There would be no resistance, that way. Just new hills, here and there, where secrets would lie beneath. Never whispering. Never telling, of what they hid. <nl> The legislation she carried only needed a signature. <nl> > Juliet struggled against her bindings as the man dug silently into the ground with broken branches and stones. <nl> > The forest floor was hard from the winter, but his progress was steady. The earth slowly opened its mouth, ready to swallow her. <nl> >"Please," she wanted to say. "Please." But her cries were muffled. <nl> It was so dark. And her chest was so heavy. <nl> She could hear the paper in her pocket rustling with each laboured breath, as if it too struggled for air. <nl> How long has she been here for now? An hour? A day? <nl> Surely he'd come back for her. They were soulmates, after all. <nl> What could be more important than fate? <eos>

<sos> ######[](#dropcap) <nl> "You like that, huh?" <nl> Cora scrolled down the poster's history. She didn't know how they had gotten ahold of the details of her cases, but they were all there in black and white. Nomad363. She simply couldn't have them exposing her. <nl> It wasn't easy to track him down. She had called on her organization's private detective, even got back in contact with some of her old contacts--one of who had thrown a dagger at her head the second she had walked in the door--but no one knew where he was. Or who he was. <nl> IP tracking didn't work. And if that wasn't the strangest thing, it was that the government had no files on the man. He had his own subreddit, so his name wasn't difficult to trace. And he had even put up a picture of his face. Such an open and close case, and yet she had been struggling to find him for two weeks at this point, with no sign of even narrowing down the search. <nl> Thomas Gordon. <nl> The impossible man. <nl> Maybe, she would've stopped looking. She had never encountered such an impossible case before, and there was nothing for her to do. Except, one day when she was simply walking down the street, she just saw him. Right there. Walking out from the grocery store with a large bag of groceries in his hand. <nl> She tailed him back to his house, then picked the lock. After it turned dark, she gingerly stepped inside. <nl> The house was quite normal looking, with a Persian rug in the entranceway and wooden floors. A dining room to the side of the entryway had a display cabinet with china displayed in it. The lights had been turned off, all except a soft glow coming from the room towards the back of the house. <nl> As she crept her way toward the room, gun held at the ready, she noticed the papers scattered around. Balled up wads of lined paper and printer paper, just scattered around. She picked one up off the desk and her eyes widened. <nl> It was a sketch of her face. The likeness was impeccable, down to the tiny mole on the left side of her chin and the small, raised ridge of a scar on the right side of her forehead. <nl> So this man clearly knew more about her than she thought. Who was giving him this information though? There was no indication that he was anything besides ordinary. She shook her head. It didn't really matter. She would simply have to pull that information from him. <nl> Cora slowly turned the knob to the door, her body pressed flat against its surface, and let it swing open. Inside, a man sat with his back to her, typing away on his laptop. With silent steps, she walked up to him, pressing the gun to the back of his head. Then she cocked it. <nl> He froze. <nl> "Who is this?" his voice quavered. He slowly spun around in his chair, his hands now held up in the air, and turned to face her. His eyes widened. <nl> "I'm Cora. The one you've been writing prompts about. Have you been having fun?" <nl> "Wha-what? But- " <nl> "How did you get all the information on me? Who gave it to you?" she snarled, pressing the gun harder against his temple. <nl> "I..."--he looked more shocked and dazed than anything--"I don't...how is this possible?" <nl> Cora's brows furrowed. There was something strange about this man's reaction. He should've been pleading for his life. Or confident. Not sitting there in a plaid shirt, a half dazed look on his face as if he didn't know what was going on. <nl> "This isn't possible," he repeated, as if to himself. "You're just some character I created. You shouldn't exist. This isn't even--" His gaze swung around wildly, and it was then that Cora noticed the walls. For the first time in her life since she had started down this path of no return, she felt shivers run down her spine. <nl> All along the walls were posters of her. Each one's backdrop detailing a case that no one in the world knew about besides her. In one poster, the man pleading for his life, wearing a silly blue tie with a whale on it. On another, a woman laying in bed, a mirror on the dresser besides the bed. All details that couldn't have been known except for the person who was there. Except for her, and the dead ones. And everyone knew the dead tell no tales. <nl> "How?" The words came out of her mouth unbidden. She couldn't feel her fingers, like someone had dunked them in an ice bath for hours. <nl> Then she turned toward his monitor. Toward the cursor that was still blinking on the interface that could only be Reddit. Hesitantly, she walked towards it, dreading what it would say. Maybe she knew already, even in that moment. But when her eyes scanned the words, she could still feel her heart pounding loudly in her chest, unable to hear anything besides the blood rushing past her ears. <nl> **[WP] You are the world's most elite assassin.

<sos> The driver's license read 'John Ricardo'. "Who the fuck is John Ricardo?!" She exclaimed, her voice deep and hoarse. Where was her long flowing hair? Where were her high heels and designer bag? What the fuck was going on? <nl> The crowd around him, erm, her, was in the same chaotic and confused state. An older gentlemen was rolling around on the floor wailing like an infant, she was pretty sure he'd shit himself. A young boy was running about hysterically, screaming "I'm young again! It's a God damn miracle!"; and a beautiful woman had removed her clothes and couldn't seem to stop touching herself, her smile as wide as her eyes. <nl> The woman who now inhabited John Ricardo's bulky body lumbered over to an elderly woman who was sitting calmly on a bench, "Excuse me, but are you in your own body? Do you know what's going on?" <nl> The old woman frowned as she looked up, "No, I'm not in my own damn body. Just some other old bag who's just as wrinkled and broken as I am," She had slowly risen and began walking away, "Real good one, God, world-wide body swap and I'm still wearing a fuckin diaper, next time swap me with a corpse!" <nl> John Ricardo's body's new pilot saw a scuffle break out across the street, 'Oh no, people are losing it' She thought to herself 'Somebody needs to get this under control'. <nl> Her prayers were answered, someone was standing atop a police car and had a megaphone in hand, "Everyone! Please, calm down!" The scuffle had calmed, and all confused eyes now turned towards the sound of the commanding, yet delicate voice. "I know this may sound hard to believe, but I am a Brigadier General in the United States Army. Whatever has happened to us, we must work together to calmly reorganize and find a solution!" <nl> The crowd examined the vessel that emitted the sensible commands: A small girl, no more than 10 years of age, dressed in a girl scout's uniform. <nl> All were quiet for a few moments, until the silence was broken by the young boy who had been sprinting about in euphoria, "Yes, General, you're absolutely right. I'll have two boxes of thin mints and a box of Do-si-dos, Sir!" <nl> The crowd erupted into a roar of unfamiliar laughter <nl> ; John Ricardo's deep gut chuckle the loudest among them. <nl> [PART 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8f6b2y/wp_two_minutes_ago_every_individual_worldwide/dy33iwr/) <nl> [PART 3]( <nl> https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8f6b2y/wp_two_minutes_ago_every_individual_worldwide/dy4giv2/) <nl> [PART 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8f6b2y/wp_two_minutes_ago_every_individual_worldwide/dy8nmhr/) <nl> [PART 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8f6b2y/wp_two_minutes_ago_every_individual_worldwide/dyb96un/) <nl> This story and more over at /r/BeagleTales <eos>

<sos> I was packing up some of Fi's old things when suddenly it hit me. <nl> Three weeks, four days, two hours without a lick. <nl> It was a strange little thing, just one of those things that made Fi, well, Fi. Randomly, out of nowhere, "just to let you know it's really me." <nl> Sometimes, it would happen in public, and people would give us strange looks, but we'd act like nothing even happened. <nl> Sometimes, she'd stop mid-sentence for a lick, and continue on like nothing ever happened while our friends and I all tried to stifle our laughter. <nl> Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I'd wake up to a familiar wet sensation against my arm and a whispered "sorry". <nl> I laid the box on the floor and sat down, staring at the now barren counter. A few minutes ago, it had been covered in tiny pebbles, each one equally spaced from the others. Another one of her Fi-diosyncrasies, as we used to call them. I tried to remember some of the others, trying to remember her. <nl> How, whenever she turned on a lightswitch, she'd flick it three times, on then off then on again. <nl> How she'd go to the fridge and open it, look inside for a second, then close it, even though she'd just looked a few minutes ago. <nl> How she'd take the stairs in an alternating pattern, one stair, two stair, one stair, two stair, the sound of the two pounding through the house. <nl> She hadn't been able to do the last one in over a year, though. <nl> I remember finding her, lying on the stairs, passed out. At first, the doctors said she'd be fine, that all she needed was a few days rest. Over time, though, it became clear that wasn't true. <nl> I watched her slowly fall apart, one Fi-diosyncrasy at a time. Day by day, she lost the energy required to keep up all her obsessions, and then to do anything at all. <nl> After she couldn't walk anymore, she'd randomly call me up to the bed, saying she needed something. She'd talk faintly, almost in a whisper, so that I'd have to lean close to hear her. And then, I'd feel something wet hit my cheek. "Just so you know it's still me.", she'd whisper. <nl> I picked up the box again and headed out the door to the car. But then, I noticed something. <nl> A small cat sat on the porch. No collar, matted and dirty fur; probably a stray. I put down the box again, and knelt to get a closer look at it. <nl> Suddenly, it dashed over to me, and gave me a small lick on the hand. It stared at me, eyes wide. <nl> Just so that you know it's really me. <nl> Now, I'm no believer in reincarnation. I know that, whatever happens, my wife is gone now, and nothing's going to change that. <nl> But that didn't stop me from calling it Fi. <eos>

<sos> "She did it, damn it!" Detective Patel shouted, slamming his fists down on the cheap plywood desk, causing computers and coworkers alike to jump. <nl> "Hey, Nikhil, calm down," his partner, Sergei Kordev warned him in his thick Ukrainian accent. "Claire submit blood. It clear. She did not do it." <nl> Nikhil jabbed a finger at the screen. "Something's wrong, can't you see it? She was the only one who could have done it. No defensive wounds on the vic, they were alone, and she ran for four days! If she was innocent, why run?" <nl> "The girl was probably scared," detective Kordev shrugged. "Her boyfriend was killed in front of her. She didn't know what to do." <nl> "Most scared people go to the police," Nikhil muttered, pacing across the floor. <nl> "You wouldn't if you were a black girl caught in an isolated cabin with a body and enough drugs to kill a rhino," sergeant Jackson interrupted, walking in with her first coffee of the night shift. "Good evening, boys." <nl> "Sarge," Sergei acknowledged. <nl> "If they had the drugs, why was her blood so clear? That's a sure crime! Her blood is too white - has she never lied or cheated on anything in her entire life?" detective Patel demanded. <nl> "Blood doesn't lie," Sergei grunted, opening another case file. "Makes the job very easy, no? Boyfriend probably was selling them without her know. Knowing. His blood, not so clear, right? Maybe upset customer, gets in close before he realizes?" <nl> "And stabs him almost forty times before he dies? No way. He would have had to be asleep or high to not defend himself. Did we get a tox screen back?" <nl> "Ease up, Patel," Sgt. Jackson warned him. "Isabelle was on her vacation when the case came in, she'll run it when she gets back. It's not like we rely on forensics very much." <nl> Nikhil sighed, slumping down into his chair and leaning back. He ran a hand through his tousled hair and looked up at the ceiling. <nl> "Okay, picture this." <nl> Sergei sighed heavily, and Sgt. Jackson rolled her eyes towards the heavens. <nl> "Just hear me out," Patel huffed. They quieted, and he continued. "Imagine you're Claire. You've got this jackass of a boyfriend - sells drugs, runs guns, almost certainly beats her based on those bruises - a total deadbeat who has never held down a real job or even finished school. If you're completely pristine, milk-white blood, why are you clinging to this guy? Did he have something on her? How long does it take you to push back?" <nl> The sergeant shrugged. "Love is blind. Still doesn't explain the blood proving her innocence." <nl> "Love is stupid," Sergei corrected, rubbing an old wedding band. "But the sergeant is right. Blood is proof." <nl> "But it's not," Nikhil cried out, frustrated. "What if she faked the test?" <nl> "I administer test," detective Kordev growled. <nl> "Some sort of injected fluid under the skin of her finger?" <nl> "I verify with mouth sample, from gum," Sergei replied. "Clair would be very dead if she fill her body with embalming fluid." <nl> "Maybe it's some sort of genetic mutation. Animal blood doesn't change colour." <nl> "You're going to go up to a judge and tell him that a black girl is an animal," Sgt. Jackson asked, narrowing her eyes. <nl> "It's - I - That's not what I meant, Sergeant," Nikhil stuttered. <nl> "Uh huh," the nonplussed officer nodded. <nl> "Sergeant?" <nl> The discussion was interrupted by a young officer, still a rookie. Nikhil couldn't place the name of the tall, dark haired woman off the top of his head. <nl> "Some officers picked up a Claire Tyler after a botched bank robbery. Seems the hostage takers grabbed her and then tried to blame it on her." <nl> "Keep her in holding!" detective Patel shouted, grabbing his coat and badge. Sighing, his partner followed. <eos>

<sos> ######[](#dropcap) <nl> Eliza gasped, her eyes shooting open. <nl> She wildly glanced around her bedroom, still feeling her heart pound in her chest. The barbie clock on her dresser. The purple duvet on her bed. And most importantly, the full glass of water by her bed. <nl> That meant... <nl> Without bothering to tug on her slippers, she raced out of the room and down the stairs. If the glass was full, that meant--she stopped when she saw the brown haired woman in the dining room, setting down the plate on the table. <nl> "Mom," she choked out, and she opened her arms wide, diving into the warm embrace. "Mom, I missed you." <nl> Her mother simply laughed, the sound reverberating through her chest against Eliza's ear. "Did you have a nightmare?" <nl> Eliza nodded furiously. <nl> In those ten years of her life, she had run away at the age of sixteen with a boy who was no good. A boy covered in tattoos and who rode a bike. Three years later, when she had realized her mistake and tried to return home, it was to the realization that her mother had died to breast cancer when she was gone. <nl> And she had been denied a goodbye. <nl> "I'm so glad you're here. I'm so so sorry," Eliza sobbed. She gripped onto the apron strings even tighter, so desperately afraid that her mother would disappear. <nl> Her mother didn't say anything, simply gently petting her hair and patting her back. "It's okay. It was just a dream," she said. She reached into the apron's pocket and pulled out something. "Look what I have for you?" <nl> Eliza wiped her eyes and glanced at the shiny object in her mother's hand. It was a silver bracelet with a heart charm on it. <nl> "Do you like it?" <nl> Eliza nodded and allowed her mother to put it on her. <nl> Eliza's mother bent down and looked her in the eye, her own blue eyes a calm, gentle aquamarine. "If you ever miss me, just pretend the bracelet is me, okay?" <nl> Eliza looked at her mother, then at the bracelet, and nodded. <nl> ***** <nl> "Mom, please!" <nl> Her mother laughed, even while keeping her eyes on the road. At the age of seventeen, Eliza had blossomed into a beautiful girl, and her mother found joy in seeing Eliza trying to fend off boy's advances. She trusted her daughter completely. <nl> And Eliza was glad for that. Because she had made the wrong choice once, and she wouldn't make it again. She clambered into the car and tossed her backpack into the backseat. Then, she brought out the brownie that she thought wasn't that special but her mom claimed was god's gift to earth. How on earth her mother could say that about brownies that came from her school's cafeteria, she would never know, but she bought one for her mother each day anyways. <nl> Her mother complained that Eliza was purposely trying to fatten her, but Eliza always simply smiled. Only she knew that her mother would be diagnosed someone within the next two years. Why shouldn't she find any joy she could out of life now? <nl> As the engine began to purr, Eliza frowned. "Do you hear that beeping?" <nl> Her mother looked over at her worriedly. "Do you hear it again?" <nl> "Nothing." Eliza shook her head. "Never mind." <nl> Over the past year, the beeping had gotten louder. She could never pinpoint where it came from, and no one else seemed to hear it. But now, it seemed almost deafening. A noise she couldn't ignore. <nl> And all of a sudden she felt like she couldn't breathe. <nl> She gasped for breath, trying to claw at her throat, but her hands seemed to be attached to lead weights. She was stuck, staring straight ahead, as her mother drove on, oblivious. <nl> Eliza closed her eyes. <nl> She could feel a rawness in her throat, an unbearable thirst. "Water," she croaked toward her mother, her eyes still closed. Moments later, a cool rim was pressed to her lips and she gulped in the liquid. <nl> "Slow down," a voice said. <nl> But it wasn't her mother's. <nl> Eliza struggled against her heavy lids until she finally opened them. What greeted her wasn't her room or the car, but white walls and a man in a white coat. He peered down at her through his glasses, then glanced toward the life monitor that was steadily beeping. <nl> "Miss Thomas. I'm so glad you're awake. Do you feel better now?" <nl> Eliza blinked. "Where's my mother?" <nl> The doctor frowned. "Your mother?" <nl> "She was in the car with me. We must have gotten into an accident." <nl> The doctor looked down at his pad, then scribbled something. He turned toward the nurse standing next to him. "Go get me the MRI results." He turned back to Eliza. "You were with a man when you crashed. His name was Jacob Snyder. You weren't with your mother." <nl> Her heart dropped. <nl> Jacob. That had been the boy. The boy with the tattoo. <nl> "How...how old am I?" <nl> The doctor looked at her, seeming to hesitate before answering. "You're 24, Miss Thomas. Don't worry. We'll figure out what's going on. It might be a slight concussion from the accident. You were knocked out for a couple days." <nl> Eliza could barely hear him over the ringing in her ears. So she was 24. And still with Jacob. With difficulty, she pulled her left wrist out from under the bed sheets and glanced at it. One after another, tears began to drip down her cheeks, almost uncontrollably, until she was a gasping, sobbing mess, hysterically crying in front of a doctor who simply stood there frozen, completely unsure what to do. <nl> There was no bracelet. <nl> There was no bracelet, and no goodbye. <nl> ***** <nl> r/AlannaWu <eos>

<sos> ######[](#dropcap) <nl> "I've told you a million times, you've got to learn the Latin," the old man huffed at his young apprentice, watching as she continued to speak in English. <nl> Luna rolled her eyes. <nl> "Latin is a dead language," he continued. "So the meanings of words will stay consistent." <nl> "I'll be fine, grandpa. There isn't that much overlap with words that I'd use for spells anyway. I've gotta go meet up with Milo right now, so I'll talk to you later!" She dashed out of the house, unwilling to take her grandfather's nagging anymore. <nl> It was so difficult to remember all those latin words, and she could progress so much more quickly with learning spells if she just stuck to English. <nl> Just off-road, she suddenly noticed movement. <nl> Luna froze and held her breath, gazing into the trees next to the dirt path. She had wanted to take a shortcut to Milo's because it was growing dark, so she had decided to cut through the forest area. She didn't usually like to take this path because there were all sorts of wildlife around, but she had decided that it would fine if she did just once. <nl> Slowly, she noticed the leaves and grass on the ground begin to quiver. She kept her eyes trained carefully on where the movement was coming from. Within moments, the creature came into a view. <nl> With black and red stripes, it slithered onto the side of the road, its gaze focused on her as it bared its fangs and hissed. <nl> Luna felt her mind blank out. Snakes had always been her greatest fear, and she could feel her heart beginning to race and her legs wobble. She fumbled before managing to pull out her wand from her pocket. Her lips felt numb. <nl> *Please don't strike, please don't strike.* <nl> She stayed as still as possible until her wand was pointed at the snake. Then, she uttered the words that she had never dared utter before. A spell that that would have lasting consequences that couldn't be taken back. <nl> "Slay," she whispered, watching the rip of electricity hit the snake from the end of her wand. She had expected it to fall still, maybe even to explode into a couple of different parts. <nl> Instead, before her eyes, it slowly grew until its head, when reared back, reached her waist. Its coat also began shiny, almost blinding, and within her terror, she managed to notice that it had grown...eyelashes? <nl> Luna gulped, thinking of her grandfather's warning as the snake hissed and reared back. <nl> It lunged. <nl> ***** <nl> More fantasy stories at r/AlannaWu! <eos>

<sos> Isabella was always gifted. We knew that from the day she was born and I held her in my arms. <nl> We had to protect her, covet her from the cruel world that would bite at her. Its rough edges like rusted metal that would tear jarring wounds. <nl> It was safe within our farm. We toiled and did our work, secluded from the rest of the world. Surrounded for miles on end only by gravel and rocks. It was lonely, sure, but we were safe. My dear Isabella was safe. <nl> She didn't know what it meant to have friends, I would see her playing with the animals instead. Chasing the chickens like some cute goliath. I would scold her for rummaging around with the pigs. Her adorable giggles contrasting their oinks. I found it hard to stay mad at her. I found it hard to pretend like I was upset. She seemed so happy. <nl> "We have to tell her." The guilt that kept rising over the years gnawed away at my wife and me, aging us. How wrong we were. How foolish it was for us to think that we knew better. We weren't trying to protect Isabella, we were protecting ourselves. Acting out of our own desire to not see our daughter get hurt. But it was that protection that caused her to grow up to be a fine women and not understand what it meant to live. We deprived her of that. <nl> "Honey, we need to show you something." Isabella mirrored our worried expressions. Our features weathered with age and the weight of our guilt causing our shoulders to slouch. <nl> "Show me what?" She asked. <nl> "It's best if we just show you." <nl> With the rising dawn, Isabella and I got into my truck and drove into the horizon. The sun was rising over the horizon to shine light upon my regret. <nl> Even then, I had second thoughts, I wanted to turn around and for us to stay secluded within our little world in the middle of nowhere, away from the cruel reality of life. Even I had avoided contact with humans for many years, joining my daughter in her cruel punishment. <nl> Would she hate us for depriving her of the truth? For keeping her away from the rest of humanity, caged in by bars made of our own lies and deceit? Or perhaps she would forgive us, and be opened to a world that wished to hurt her. <nl> No -- I could no longer avoid this. I drove on, dust trailing behind us. <nl> The roads lay empty and barren. The city that used to bustle with life was now just unnervingly quiet. It seemed wrong. A stillness that whispered of cold death. <nl> "Where is everyone?" I asked myself as the door to my truck closed shut. <nl> "They don't exist, remember, dad? You told me that." <nl> I turned to Isabella, I had come this far. She had to know the truth one way or another. My lip quivered; perhaps I guided her all the way out here so I did not have to say I lied, that I didn't have to explain to my own daughter what had been done. But it seemed fitting that just as my lips sowed the lie into existence, they too would reap punishment. <nl> "I lied, sweetheart. We aren't the last people on earth. We never were. We wanted to protect you from it all, from the cruelty." <nl> Isabella giggled, that same innocent giggle when she rolled with the pigs, oblivious of lives, just like how her coil-tailed friends were oblivious of their fate as food. <nl> "I know." She said. She was not angry, she was not shocked. She just smiled, a knowing smile that spoke of her adventurous and affable self. She was being coy. <nl> "What do you mean?" I frowned. <nl> "Daddy, I am not an idiot. I always knew that humans existed. I know a lot of things you don't seem to. I also knew why you hid them from me." She shook her head. "I never needed protection, daddy, but I knew you were afraid of them. Afraid of humans. We didn't need them anyway. We have our little farm and we can just live there in our little world." <nl> "Isabella. Dear. What are you saying?" <nl> She giggled. "I made them disappear, daddy. We don't need anyone else, nobody will ever hurt you again. We can be happy." <nl> The abandoned buildings that surrounded us now seemed lonely. Without purpose. Serving instead as tall tombstones for the whole of mankind. A sad and worthless legacy of our civilisation; a civilisation brought to an abrupt end before it could live out a full life. <nl> I realised then, that my innocent daughter was born with godly powers, the ability to bend reality to her will. And it was her naive and unknowing self that acted void of malice, but that unbridled desire to do good without understanding the consequences made her erase all of mankind in an instant. <nl> I created a monster. <nl> *** <nl> /r/KikiWrites <nl> *** <nl> [Part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8gx9lu/wp_you_and_your_wife_decided_to_raise_your/dyflvd5/) <eos>

<sos> Erica pulled the trigger. I stopped the shot before it fired. <nl> "You're an asshole," Erica said. She opened her eyes and stared straight at me. She should not be able to see me. <nl> I blinked and moved back. <nl> "Don't give me that," she whispered. She shuffled onto her feet and dropped her shotgun at her side. "I know you're here. I can *feel* you. It's just us." <nl> She was not meeting my eyes, her gaze landed on my chest. Erica was fire. It was the only reason she had survived this long. Former military, young - but not young enough to be stupid, and no family to hold her back. I found her last winter. She lived in a cave in the mountains, by the mouth of a brook with a bubbling hot spring only a half mile downstream. She did not need my help, at least not as much as the others. <nl> "I've felt you here before. Following me around," she sighed. <nl> Erica was cold today. Her eyes sunk into her skeletal face, framed by a broken halo of hair. Her left pinky and ring fingers were twisted and wrapped with blackened tape. This house did not suit her. <nl> "I've heard rumours about you. Saul told me he saw you last summer when he was sick. He said he was lying there, wishing for it to all be over, and then he felt a cool hand on his back. He told me he thought it was Death, finally here to take away the pain. But darkness didn't come. He could just *breathe* again, and walked away from his deathbed like it was only a head cold." <nl> Erica shuddered. The wind railed against the wall and blew through the shattered back window. "A few years back we were dropping like flies. All of us survivors - people who were smart and capable of living through the first wave - were just falling. Five years ago there were thousands of survivors. I could barely get through a small town without having to hide from looters. And then three years ago I didn't come across a single person in all of New York." <nl> Erica was ice. Her voice rattled in her throat. It was true, though. Even the survivors could not hold back the tides. I am the only one who can. <nl> "I don't think anyone's died since the winter before last." <nl> She was right. A year and a half ago I began to look for them and stood watch over the handful of survivors. I even guided them towards each other. A last hope for them. For me. <nl> "Saul said that you were Life. I don't think that's true. Life knows when to let go." Erica's head slumped forward. Her body shook with a sob. "I want to go." <nl> *No*. <nl> "Please," she whispered, "Just - just let me leave." <nl> --- <nl> /r/liswrites <eos>

<sos> I watched mostly. <nl> Since I would forget the beginning and there would be no end, there was little else to do. Playing a part in the world seemed to have no effect. Anything I built faded away. Any person I came to know would be gone. It all seemed so inconsequential. I watched an endless ocean of humanity, none of them memorable. <nl> Except one. <nl> She was different. I saw her here and there. Slipping through the flow of time. Sometimes old. Sometimes young. She found me first. Or maybe I found her and she came back for me. I don't know. But it was early. Very early. Not long after I discovered that time did not pass for me as it did for others. In Egypt, during the time of the Pharaohs. I was sitting on the bank of the Nile, watching the waters slowly pass when she sat beside me. She was old. <nl> "It's beautiful, isn't it?" <nl> "Yes." I replied. Her accent was strange. "Who are you?" <nl> She smiled at me, "I forget that you haven't met me yet." She extended a hand, "I'm Sarah." There was a merriment to her blue eyes, shining forth with a vibrancy that belied the wrinkled skin of her face. <nl> I glance at her hand and then accept it. It felt somehow natural. "I'm Zel." <nl> "I know." <nl> "How? Have we met?" I asked. <nl> "Yes. A long time ago and a long time from now." <nl> "What does that mean?" <nl> "It means that I am special Zel. Like you, but different." She replied, turning to watch the Nile as well. <nl> "Time doesn't pass for you?" <nl> "It flows around me. I dip and dive throughout it, though I can't control it." She smiled, a bit of sadness in her face. "This is the earliest I have come back." <nl> "Oh. Do you like it?" <nl> "I like that you are here. I wasn't sure you would be." She took a handful of the silt, rubbing it between her finger and forefinger. <nl> "Are we friends?" <nl> She turned to look at me. "More." <nl> Then she was gone. <nl> I did not see her again for a century, the memory of the initial encounter fading but still present. <nl> When I saw her next she was young. Younger than me. Just a child. I cannot explain why I was drawn to her. Maybe it was because she looked out of place. Like she did not belong. Her clothing was strange. She looked different than everyone else. And she was scared. Streams of tears were running down her face. <nl> I did not recognize her yet. She was just an oddity that had attracted my attention amidst a sea of sameness. I walked up and knelt down in front of her. Her brilliant blue eyes peered out from a cascade of blonde hair. As soon as her eyes locked with mine, I knew. I don't know how. I just did. She was so different this time. Not the wizened woman that had sat beside me a century before. She was vulnerable. Alone. <nl> "Sarah?" I whispered. <nl> Her eyes widened, she wiped the tears from her face with the back of her forearm. "I\-I\-I don't know what's going on. How do you know me?" <nl> I reached out and offered my hand to her, just as she had done so long ago. After a moment of hesitation, she took it. I gave it a squeeze of comfort. "I'm Zel. I met you a long time ago. When you were older." <nl> She stares at me. "I...don't know what that means," she breaks down into tears again. <nl> I pull her hand closer and wrap her into a hug. "You are special Sarah. Like me. Wherever you go, if you find me, i will be the same. I will be here in the world. Always waiting." <nl> She cried into my shoulder, trying to understand. She didn't want to be this way. <nl> Then she was gone. <nl> A few hundred years passed before I saw her again. I had grown restless in the intervening time, tired of watching the flow of humanity around me. I had taken up the sword and put it down. I had ruled and been ruled. None of it made an impression. None of it mattered. I just wanted to see her again. To know she was safe. To be there for the one person that might understand me and that I could understand in return. <nl> And then she was there. <nl> A beautiful woman. My age by appearance, though I was hundreds of years beyond her. She was standing on the edge of a field, watching the gentle sway of the crops. A faint smile was on her face as I came up to stand beside her. <nl> "Hello Zel." <nl> "Hello Sarah." <nl> She reached her hand out and I took it, feeling its warmth. "It has been a long time," I whispered. <nl> "Has it?" She squeezed my hand. "I can never tell." <nl> My thumb rubbed the back of her hand, slowly and methodically, feeling the smooth skin and the bumps of her bones underneath. <nl> "How long?" She asked. <nl> "A few centuries." <nl> "That long?" <nl> "Yes." <nl> "When did you see me last?" <nl> "In the markets in Cairo. You were crying." I lace my fingers between hers, locking us together. Hoping we could stay like this. Her time would be short though. Just as mine was always long. <nl> She nods, "That was the first time." <nl> "Are you ok?" <nl> "Yes. It helps when we find each other." <nl> "Why?" <nl> "You're my constant. You're the only way I know time." <nl> I nod at this, "I understand. You're my permanence." <nl> "I am glad we found each other this time Zel. The last trip was...upsetting." <nl> "Why?" <nl> "The world doesn't always look like this. Sometimes things have gone wrong." <nl> "What happens?" <nl> "Let's just enjoy this moment. It will happen when it happens." <nl> I turn to look at the field, enjoying her hand in mine. <nl> Then she was gone. <nl> **I have added** [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerilousPlatypus/comments/8hdoii/story_continuation_zel_sarah_part_2/) **on my sub.

<sos> Last time i saw her must have been in 1887. Before that in 1704. Every time Chloe disappeared again, i died a little bit inside. I never knew if she'd be back in a few hours, or a few hundred years. <nl> Today is 5th of May, 2213. It's been 326 years since i last saw her. She was usually back within 200 years, so this time i was starting to get worried. If something happened to her somewhere, i'd never know. She isn't immortal, i've always told her, but it didn't stop her from going on wild adventures she always told me about. <nl> Everytime i went outside, i was hoping i'd see her again. To smell her hair, hold her hands and kiss her. <nl> I called a cab, because i needed to go buy some food. After a few minutes, a yellow capsule stops in front of me. It was wonderful seeing all the change throughout the years. I kinda miss riding the horse day and night to get from one town to another, now it was just a question of a few minutes. The back door opened and i got in. This capsule was an older model, because it still required a pilot. The back and the front were divided. A small red light started flashing from a screen in front of me. I put my hand to the light. "Scanning chip, please wait." Definitely an older model, the new ones automatically scanned the chip when a passenger entered. "Scan completed, please select your destination." I put in the adress and hit confirm. <nl> "Going to Harbor Street Mall?" asked a female voice, "it's a shame they are taking it down in 70 years." <nl> "Oh really? I don't really check the news so i wouldn't know." i answered. <nl> "It's not in the news you idiot." <nl> That was unexpected. I believed most of the people were kind these days. <nl> "Why would you..." <nl> It must be. Who else would this be. <nl> The capsule took a turn and we landed on a field next to the main flightway. I got out. Then the front door opened. It was her, it was Chloe. <nl> "Are you just gonna stare at me like that all day?" she asked. <nl> I don't think i've hugged anyone this tight in all my years on Earth. This went on for about 5 minutes and i didn't want it to stop, beacause i knew she'd be gone again soon. She told me all about her adventures. She told me how she visited the cavemen again. Apparently she's some kind of godess to them and they even started painting her in caves. But she also spent a good amount of time in her normal life. She never told me which year she visits me from. For her, all the time between us seeing each other again was a few days, weeks or months at most. <nl> 10th of May, 2213 <nl> She's been with me for 5 days now, and i know she's leaving today. She always left after 5 days. <nl> "I need to talk to you." she told me. <nl> "What is it?" <nl> I sensed that this might be something really bad. Over the years, i've learned to read people very well. She was about to cry. <nl> "I... I don't know if we'll be able to see each other again," she said, her eyes filling with tears, "i only got a 100 time travel points and this, this is the last one." <nl> "What do you mean? You can get more right?" <nl> "You.. You can't, they only gave 100 to people who entered the program. There is no way to get more." <nl> She showed me her watch. <nl> "Time left - 01:42" <nl> One minute and forty two seconds. It took me a few seconds to process this information. <nl> "Why didn't you tell me sooner?" i said, also beginning to cry. <nl> "I didn't know if i cou..." <nl> I didn't let her finish the sentence. I've kissed her, for the last time. I looked into her sky blue eyes and stroked her beautiful brown hair. <nl> "It's okay Chloe, i love you." i told her with my voice trembling. <nl> "Time left - 00:28" <nl> We hugged, both crying. <nl> It was a weird feeling. One second, you are holding someone in your arms, feeling the heat of their body, their breath on your neck, and in the next, nothing. <nl> She was gone. I stood in that spot the whole night. <nl> That happened 1487 years ago. The pain never went away. I wish there was a way to end it all. <eos>

<sos> You know how when you're a child, lots of abnormal things seem normal to you because there's nothing for you to judge the experience against? That's how Bub and I started. <nl> Everyone else in Mr. Langhorne's class received their pen pal letters that day. Mine came, too, and if the paper had funny, oily texture and closed with a wax seal instead of a stamp, so what? That just meant my pen pal was cooler than Jimmy's. And for once that little twerp had to agree with me. I wrote back, thanking my pen pal for being so cool. <nl> Bub responded fast. His reply came within a week, asking how I had come by his letter. So I told him all about how Mr. Langhorne has passed out the letters, and how Bub's science experiment sounded fun. I hoped he had been able to find the newt eyes he needed. I had some frog spawn in a pond behind the house. If Bub needed, I could probably post him a jar full. He said yes. <nl> And unlike most of the class's pen pals, Bub and I kept writing. Bub's classes were more interesting than mine, but he seemed to like hearing about how hard I found multiplication at first. I wanted to hear about those ritual lessons his super-strict homeschooling dad was making him take. Bub told me about how he messed up once and instead of conjuring a fire sprite, he'd only managed a soot dog. He named it Inky. <nl> The years went by. And the letters kept coming. By high school I wondered why we never needed stamps on our envelopes. Or why I could mail him pictures, but he could only send drawings. I never cared enough to look into it, though. I would get distracted by things like landing the role of Lady Macbeth and Bub was more excited than I was. For some reason he never had to read Shakespeare for his classes. He did have to learn to bend iron and shape it into a bunch of weird sigil designs. He drew some of them for me. They weren't exactly pretty, but Bub said he was happy with how they turned out, so I was happy for him. <nl> I hoped by college, maybe we could go to school in the same area. Or at least switch to email. I wanted to hear from him more than once a week. But Bub's letters did make Monday more bearable. He said he was apprenticed to one of his dad's friends and couldn't come to college. I supposed learning a trade made more sense in today's economy, but I was still bummed. He drew me a picture of Inky, and I thought he was the weirdest dog ever, all puffy black with red eyes and a fire tongue. But I guess that's what happens with mis-summoned soot dogs. <nl> My college friends didn't know what to make of my pen pal relationship with Bub. By this time, he knew everything about me, and I knew everything about him. He was my closest friend, and my confidant. And if I were honest with myself, he was the reason I had never dated. I was too emotionally invested in Bub. <nl> That's why his last scroll, telling me of his father's death, was so difficult for me. I knew how much he respected his father. How good he had been at ruling over the demon kingdom. And now Bub has to step up while dealing with his grief. "I can't do this alone," his letter told me. "I need you by my side. Please," wrote the man I had never met but loved with all my heart, "be my bride. Yours always, Beelzebub." <nl> *Edit to add part two:* <nl> I was surprised how quickly I was taken up on my "Yes, of course."  It only took until Monday for the next letter.  Except it wasn't a scroll.  It was a box.  An empty box, with this scrawled on the side in familiar handwriting. <nl> "I've had to bend the rules a bit to make this work.  You and I both know this whole thing was out of the ordinary.  Anything you can fit into this box can come with you.  Thank you.  You have no idea how much I have relied upon our friendship since my father took ill. I cannot wait to see you." <nl> It's hard to sort through your life, and condense it down to one banker's box.  Pictures of home.  Pictures of family.  Some of friends.  A tatty old stuffed elephant I'd had since before I could remember. My favorite book. Bub's first letter to me.  But really, what do you bring to a demon kingdom? Do they have electricity? Flush toilets? I really hoped they had flush toilets.  I could probably forego the electricity, but I like plumbing. <nl> I tried not to worry about how I was going to get there, either.  I had purposefully not paid attention to how my letters went wherever they went, or how Bub's came to me.  Now I regretted not asking.  Or paying more attention.  To be completely honest, I hadn't wanted to pay attention.  Maybe if I looked too closely at what was happening, it would go away.  Or I'd find out the whole thing was an illusion.  I didn't want Bub to be an imaginary friend that I'd built into more. <nl> So when Monday dawned and nothing happened, I was both relieved and depressed.  Until the pentagram of fire burned into existence through my kitchen linoleum as I sat there drinking my second cup of coffee. I wasn't going to get my deposit back now, my brain mumbled somewhere beyond the static of my shock. <nl> But there was Bub, smiling at me with his a-little-bit-too-pointy teeth.  Relief flooded through me.  This was my friend.  Someone who knew me, and loved me, and had been there through all my awkward phases.  I'd seen his self-portraits throughout the years. This smile looked a little less certain than those in the drawings, as I'm sure mine was.  My stomach was doing flip-flops that had nothing to do with all the coffee. <nl> "Bub?" I asked, my voice unsteady. <nl> "Joon-hee," he sighed like a fire catching up kindling. <nl> My smile grew into a real grin.  I picked up my box and walked over to him.  "I'm ready." <nl> He took my hand and pulled me into the pentagram. The kitchen vanished. <nl> *Edit to add part three* <nl> I don't know what I expected a demon kingdom to look like, but I didn't expect trees.  Or grass.  Or moss.  The rain was really weirding me out, and not just because I grew up in Southern California. The ground was squishy and springy under my feet.  Bub didn't seem to think it was unusual though, as the fire of our travel pentagram fizzled out into an unenthusiastic heap of ash. <nl> "This is home," he said in a bedraggled exhalation. For all that I hadn't known him in person for all that long, I could hear the disappointment dripping from the word 'home'. <nl> I'd expected a castle made of stone with giant crenellations at the top, and fire breathing chimeras guarding the front gate. We'd never talked much about our homes.  He'd said he was a prince of demons who worked with metal.  I'd said I was a student, and hadn't liked math.  More often than not, our letters revolved around what we were doing and explaining those things to each other, rather than much of the setting. He didn't understand soccer, which I played in college for a while.  I didn't understand the seventy five uses of blasting runes.  It took longer to explain soccer. <nl> But hey, where we were didn't seem so terrible.  There certainly was plenty of iron. It ranged in color from jet black to oxidized red, and every shade in between.  The doors had figures carved all over them; the ones I noticed looked a lot like praying mantises battling others that looked like whales with legs. I hoped the whales won. I didn't have time to tell though, as the doors creaked before a green person swung them open.  "Ah, Sire, you're back." He didn't' seem pleased.  "I take it your mission was... successful?" He was eyeing me now. His pupils were square, like a goat's. <nl> "Yes, Iskur.  You know she agreed to come." <nl> "I did.  But I did not think she would be so foolish to actually keep that promise." <nl> Bub squeezed my hand here as he replied, "You know little of this matter. Now, welcome Joon-Hee properly." <nl> I couldn't read this green man's expression as he looked me over again, but his voice was emotionless now. "I bid you welcome, Madam Joon-Hee, to the City of Martu." His mumble that "we don't need another astrologer, let alone a human one," gave me a pretty good idea of where he stood on my arrival. <nl> I raised an eyebrow at Bub.  "Astrologer?" <nl> "Yes, isn't that what you were in school for?" <nl> I laughed.  "No, astronomer.  It isn't even a little the same." <nl> The puzzled expression on his far-more-human face was the first time I wondered what I might have jumped into without much thought. I wasn't sure I should ask what he thought I'd spent that much time learning all that math for. <eos>

<sos> Amanda kicked and screamed, the sharp brimstone ripping her pajamas to shreds. Crying, she landed on the blackened floor of an immense chamber. The demon let go of her ankle, and the gate slammed shut behind her. <nl> For a while, only her ragged breathing echoed through the room. Then there was a crackle of fire. <nl> "I apologize on behalf of Abaddon," a silky voice said from the far corner of the room. "He can be a bit... *inconsiderate* at times." <nl> "What's happening?" Amanda said, rubbing her eyes. "Where am I?" <nl> "Why, Hell, of course." <nl> "Why, what did I do wrong?" <nl> "Oh, nothing, my dear. You wrote in your last letter that you wanted to meet before answering my proposal." <nl> Amanda stood up and her eyes suddenly narrow. "You're Marc?" <nl> "It's actually pronounced with an s-sound as in Marcellixis. But yeah." <nl> Amanda looked at the silhouette sitting on the throne. His red eyes burned like hot iron in the darkness. "So... everything you wrote about hell and suffering and brimstone, that wasn't metaphorical?" <nl> Marc shrugged. "I do enjoy a bit of hyperbole every now and then, but no, most of it was literal." <nl> "So, what, you're going to try and make me fall in love with you now?" <nl> "I'm not going to make you do anything, you came here of your own free will, remember?" <nl> "This is preposterous!" Amanda said, pushing her shoulder against the massive doors. <nl> "I've been accused of worse." <nl> The demon rose from the throne and sauntered up to her. His long mane of onyx hair swirled behind him like smoke. His pearly skin and chiseled face were not what she had expected. <nl> "Let's just have a date like we agreed on, and see where things lead," he said. <nl> "What if you fall in love with me, and I don't want you back?" <nl> "Oh, please." <nl> "What? It's a legitimate question." <nl> He leaned casually against the brimstone wall. A brilliant white smile parted his lips. He winked at her. <nl> "I, um..." She looked down at her feet. "It... it doesn't matter. Looks don't matter." <nl> "You already know everything about me." The demon leaned in, and the breath in her ear sent a shiver rolling down her spine. "The looks are just a bonus." <nl> "I think this is a bad idea..." <nl> "What's the worst that could happen?" <nl> She swallowed hard. No way. He was evil incarnate. There was no way. <nl> "Let's go on that date, what do you say?" he continued, running a nail down her shoulder. <nl> "You can't make me fall in love with you if I don't want to," Amanda said finally. <nl> "Oh, I would never dream of that." He looked into the distance. "True love is precious. But if we end up just friends, I'm okay with that too. We're friends, right?" <nl> Amanda nodded. "One date." <nl> "That's all I ask for." <nl> "Okay, then. But not here. On Earth." <nl> "Deal," the demon said, grinning. "I've made a reservation at Le Guinness for eight o'clock. Don't be late." <nl> Amanda opened her eyes, gasping. The alarm clock on her nightstand showed 04:12. She groaned and rolled over, trying to get back to sleep. It had only been a dream. <nl> That's when she noticed a letter on her pillow. In the light from her phone, she tore it open. There was a note inside. <nl> >Dear Amanda, <nl> >I enjoyed our first meeting very much, and I'm looking forward to our first date! <nl> >Yours truly, <nl> >Marc <nl> *** <nl> [**PART 2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lilwa_Dexel/comments/8hm31c/dating_a_demon_part_2/) <nl> r/Lilwa_Dexel for more. <eos>

<sos> There is a rock formation near Bilbao, Spain, which is notable for its incongruence with the rest of its surroundings. It resembles two obelisks, at the very edge of a sheer drop off a cliff, almost as if they were stone giants who had perched themselves there. A smaller, rounder cousin lingers a few feet behind, welded into the ground. Science does not go very far in explaining how this trio of stone came to be. <nl> My grandmother, on the other hands, offers this explanation. She claims her grandmother told it to her, and we presumed that it was passed down in kind to *her*. We believe this story to be very, very old. <nl> And as the story goes, a girl from the nearby village, one Camila, was known for her beauty and her wisdom. Lively, adventurous, she commanded attention the way steel rods on buildings attract lightning. Her heart was kind, her touch was light, and her words fell with the grace of the first snows of winter. Little wonder then that families travelled from afar to watch this Camila sing and dance and play, and many a parent schemed to have her marry their sons. <nl> Foremost amongst her suitors was Mateo, son of the village chief. He was blessed with good looks and an boisterous personality, and it was often said that you could hear his laugh before you caught sight of him. In fact, the village chief was so sure that Camila would accept Mateo's proposal of marriage that preparations were underway even before she formally accepted. Merriment coursed through the village as everyone looked forward to Camila coming into their fold. <nl> So it was that the wise woman of the village found Camila at her doorstep one morning, banging on the doors so hard that the hinges creaked. Distress was written plainly on Camila's face, and her tale was so fanciful and far-fetched that the wise woman wondered if Camila was simply having the same jitters which inflict a fair number of brides-to-be. <nl> Camila, of course, was prepared with proof. Proof in the form of a hundred, two hundred letters, half of them filled with Camila's careful, precise script, and the other emblazoned with powerful writing, as if a typhoon had learned to pick up a brush. Proof in the consistency of detail in Camila's story. Proof in the form of a wispy, shadowy figure behind Camila, his headdress held respectfully between his hands. <nl> Camila's tale was straight-forward enough. She liked Mateo, but only as a brother. Her heart had long tended towards her friend at her side now, one with whom she had spent the last ten years corresponding with over letters. Camila called him Ulix, a 'prince from far shores', but the tiny nubs of horns on the stranger's foreheard left little doubt in the wise woman's mind as to his true nature. Camila did not know what to do, and so she had come to the wise woman for help. <nl> And it seemed that Mateo had heard of this interloper as well, the one who would threaten his chances of marital bliss with the wonderful Camila. For Mateo then trundled up the pathway to the wise woman's house as well, with a collection of musclemen behind him, their pitchforks raised and unflinching. With one voice, they demanded that Camila desist from her foolishness, that she give up her heart to Mateo only. <nl> The wise women grasped the situation quickly, and pandering to the pride of the hot-headed young man and otherworldly being before her, gave them three tasks to complete. Her message was clear and unmistakable - whoever performed the tasks best would win her approval for the impending marriage with Camila. <nl> Over three days and three nights did Mateo and Ulix persevere at their tasks, and they returned to present the fruits of their labour to the wise woman. The entire village had gathered to hear the final judgment, and the silence which baked as the wise woman mulled over her words was defeaning. <nl> Eventually, the wise woman pronounced Ulix the victor. See here, the wise woman said. The first task was to make Camila happy, and here Mateo had laboured to gather an assortment of invaluable gifts and presents. In contrast, Ulix had but acquired a small tome of writings from passing peddlers, poems and stories from her favourite authors, yet it had livened Camila up much more. Ulix, and not Mateo, truly understood what it was that Camila desired. <nl> The second task was to demonstrate how much Camila meant to them, and here Mateo had also endeavored to amass the riches which he would be sharing with her. In contrast, Ulix had but set out the ways in which he had changed over the years as a result of Camila's advice. Ulix recounted how Camila's counsel had changed the way he saw the world, the way he treated his subjects, and how it had stood him well in his claim for succession to the throne. Again, it was Ulix, and not Mateo, who truly benefited from what Camila could offer to give. <nl> The third task was to convince the wise woman what life they had planned for Camila after the marriage. Mateo was crystal clear in describing the life of comfort which awaited Camila, where her greatest burdens would be to continue the family line and to mother the brood. In contrast, Ulix set out the ways in which he would ask Camila to share the toils of their existence, the tasks he would entrust to her, the dependence he would place on her. The wise woman noted the rising fury from the gathered crowd as these strange ideals were shared, but deep inside, she knew the choice was clear. <nl> With the wise woman's blessing, Ulix and Camila set off to return to his kingdom. Ulix warned everyone not to follow, for his magic could only convey him and his chosen passenger. But Mateo did not heed that warning. Blinded by anger, prickled by wounded pride, he trailed after them, a dagger hidden, waiting to be sprung. <nl> No one actually saw the final confrontation, but the unusual flurry of lightning that evening served only as invitation for one and all to investigate. Led by the wise woman, they retraced the final steps of Ulix and Camila, and found that very rock formation at the edges of the cliffs. <nl> Some say that Ulix and Camila made it to their destination, and that they had left obelisks in place so that people would remember them. <nl> Others say that Mateo had interrupted them, and had prevented them from leaving, though he sacrificed his own wellbeing in the process. These people point to the fact that Mateo never returned. <nl> Be that as it may, the rock formation stands there to this day, testament to both the best and the worst of what we can be. <nl> --- <nl> /r/rarelyfunny <eos>

<sos> Molly was in the middle of whisking when the knock came - three of them, actually, one after the other, loud, imperative. *It figures,* she thought to herself, and quickly wiped her hands on the hand-embroidered dish cloth and headed out of the kitchen. She paused in the living room to shoo a few hens out of her way - they knew better than to block her way like that. Honestly. <nl> "Good afternoon, gentlemen, what can I do ya for?" she said once she had reached and opened the door. Two men wearing suits and sunglasses were standing on her dusty wooden porch. <nl> The one on the left spoke first, "Ma'am. Good afternoon. Agent Jones and Agent Macklin, FBI. Mind if we come in?" <nl> "Well - mi casa is suitcases, as my mama liked to say." <nl> The two men remained impassive at this, causing Molly to sigh. "Because the sayin'...never mind all that, just come in, please." <nl> Molly stepped aside to allow the men to enter her home. She gestured them towards the floral-print sofa by the staircase. "Take a seat. Can I get y'all a drink? I just whipped up some lemonade this mornin' that is, if you don't mind me tootin' my own horn a bit, is delicious." <nl> "No thank you, Ma'am," Jones replied. He seemed to be the spokesman. <nl> "That's twice now y'all have called me that. Please, call me Molly. Or, if that's a might too casual, you can call me Mama K." <nl> Again, the only response was stony silence. Molly frowned. <nl> Jones spoke up again, "Ma'am, we're following up a lead regarding an incident that happened not far from here early yesterday morning. A man and his family were killed in their sleep." <nl> "My *heavens*!" Molly said, clasping her hands to collarbone. One of the hens nearby clucked in alarm at her sudden outburst. "Well, these are the times we live in, though, ain't they? You take the Bible out of school and what do you get?" <nl> "The man was an informant for an important court case." <nl> "Well oh-em-goodness, that's even worse! That poor man. Although I reckon it is dangerous work, bein' an informant for the FBI." <nl> Agent Jones and Agent Macklin both cocked their heads ten degrees to the right at the same time - it would have been impressive if it hand't been so absurd. "Ma'am," Agent Jones began, "We did not mention he was working for us." <nl> "Of course not, but you are here askin' 'bout him, and you're *from* the FBI...anyway, we can sit here shootin' at squirrels all you want, gentlemen, but I imagine you're not here just to bring me the latest news." <nl> Macklin broke his silence. "Ma'am, the individuals were pecked to death." <nl> Molly blinked at them. "I'm sorry - y'all mind repeatin' that?" <nl> "Forensics indicated that they were pecked to death. All of them." <nl> Molly allowed a small smile to creep across her lips. "Y'all came a long way just to yank an old lady's chain like this." <nl> Agent Jones took over. "Ma'am, we do not joke about these kinds of matters." <nl> Molly took a moment to let this sink in. "Pecked to death? *Pecked* to death, you say? But, my word, how would such a thing even happen? Did they have a pet bird?" <nl> "No, Ma'am. And the report indicated it was at least five different birds that committed the murder." <nl> "...and I just...I'm havin' trouble picturin' it, I s'ppose. I mean, I've been pecked a gracious plenty, especially by ol' Calpurnia, there, in the corner. But I can't imagine what it would take to *kill* someone through peckin'." <nl> "It is a very unique case, ma'am. Anyway - we were wondering if you might have seen or heard anything unusual during the night in question." <nl> "I mean, I s'ppose, you peck enough...eventually you start bleedin' so much...but still. Why would the chickens do that?" <nl> The agents cocked their heads in unison again, this time to the left. "We didn't mention chickens, ma'am." <nl> "Plus the coordination. You'd need some kinda ringleader, I guess, givin' orders and whatnot." <nl> The chickens in the room had frozen, watching the scene unfold. Both of the men tensed and slowly rose from the couch. "Ma'am, I think we're going to have to ask you --" <nl> "*Birdbath*," she barked. <nl> Molly's living room erupted into complete mayhem. The chickens who had been in the room flapped at the lawmen and began pecking and clawing. Three times that number dropped down on them from above. <nl> Molly raised her voice to be heard over the screams of the agents and the frenzied clucking of her feathered minions. "I am sorry about this, gentlemen. But y'all came into my home, refused my hospitality, and insisted on callin' me *ma'am* when I expressly asked y'all not to." <nl> She watched silently for a time, then waited for the feathers to settle. "'sides, I can't have y'all messin' 'bout with my plans. And if you think what happened to that backstabbin' boll-weevil Strathairn was bad...wait 'til y'all see what I do next." <nl> And with that, Molly turned, went back into the kitchen, and resumed her whisking. <nl> *** <nl> /r/ShadowsofClouds <eos>

<sos> Rob shone his flashlight onto the creature that was climbing down the cavern wall. "Ugh," he said. "That's one ugly insect." <nl> "Not everything can spend five hours preening itself in a mirror before leaving its  home," Claire said sarcastically as she leaned in. "Oh look, it's just a harmless little spider." <nl> Rob frowned. "Since when did spiders have ten legs?" <nl> "Huh. Well... maybe it's a new species." <nl> "Yeah? Wait, if we discovered it, that means we get to name it, right?" <nl> "I guess so?" <nl> "Cool. Once it gets to the ground, I'll christen it as: Arachnid-under-boot." <nl> "Don't you dare hurt it!" Claire said sternly. She sighed and turned away, looking for the final member of their small expedition. This spider -- or whatever it was -- was just the kind of thing Michael would be interested in. Might be another addition to the sketch book he'd brought with him. <nl> When she saw the smaller boy trailing some way behind them, she gasped. "Michael, you're..." <nl> "*What?*" said Michael, his lips trembling as he caught up with them. "What am I? Why are you making that face? Tell me!" He thought he could hear his heartbeat echoing off the cavern walls. <nl> "You're uh, you're glowing," said Rob, trying not to grin. <nl> Michael's throat rocked as he looked down at his hands. "You mean this, right? My flashlight's glowing." <nl> "Bad news buddy," Rob said with a shrug. "Your flashlight's dead. And uh, judging by what must be radiation leaking out of your body, you can't be far behind it." <nl> The flash-light tumbled to the ground and rolled down towards Claire's feet. <nl> Claire hit Rob in the stomach. "Don't listen to him. It's not radiation." <nl> "Then- then what the heck is it? You're the one that wants to be a doctor, so you must know! Tell me!" He could see it now. His skin was leaking light, and it was turning from yellow to white. His shadow even seemed to have run away from him. <nl> Claire shook her head. "I have no idea. But I think we should all try to stay calm, okay? I'm sure you're not in any danger, but just to be safe, we're going turn around right now and get you to a doctor. Uh, a *real* doctor, before you say it." <nl> "Oh crap, oh crap. We're like... it took us three hours to get this deep down. Oh crap. I knew we should have turned around when we saw that weird statue! Who carves into a rock wall this far down a cave? And two freaking mouths!?" <nl> "Relax," said Rob, running a hand through his long blond hair. "You're either going to die before we get you to a doctor, or you're going to be fine. There's no point worrying about it. Hopefully you live, because then we don't have to worry about batteries no more. Just means you'll always have to be at the front." <nl> "There's no way I'm-" the smaller boy began indignantly, when he noticed something on Rob's hand. "Have you always had that?" <nl> "Huh?" Rob furrowed his brows. "Had what?" <nl> "On your hand." <nl> Rob looked at his left hand. Fine. He turned his right palm around and let out a shriek. "Oh shit, what's that?" <nl> Claire walked over to him. "It's just a lump. Looks like a boil." As she watched, the skin next to it began to twitch. <nl> "What's wrong with my hand," he gasped. "Claire?" <nl> "It's not just your hand," said Michael, gently touching his own face with a bright white finger. <nl> A round patch of skin on Rob's perfect face began to shiver, then raise, then rip open. Finally, it blossomed into something dark and green. Something like mould. Claire recoiled, her face twisted. <nl> "Oh God, it's not that bad is it?" Rob asked running his hand over it. "It's bumpier than fucking braille! What's happening to us?" <nl> Claire shook her head. "No, it's not bad, it's just... uh... it kind of smells." <nl> "Smells? Like what?" <nl> She shrugged. "I don't know. Like meat left in the sun or something." As she spoke, another patch of skin erupted on his arm. Volcanoes spewing out spores of mould. <nl> "I'm- I'm turning into some kind of... monster." He ran another nervous hand through his hair again. This time, it came back covered in blond locks. <nl> "Just... just sit down," Claire commanded, shrugging the bag off her back. "I've got some lotion that might help." <nl> "Lotion?" he laughed. "Lotion are you--" <nl> A tsunami-like rumble ran down the passageway. Claire could only watch stunned, as a rock came loose from the top of the cavern and landed against the side of Michael's head. His face seem to bounce away from it before he collapsed onto the ground. More rocks fell, somewhere in the distance, but Claire barely registered them. <nl> "Michael!" <nl> "Oh shit," said Rob. <nl> The light from Michael's body was already weakening. By the time Claire and Rob were kneeling by his side, it had extinguished completely. <nl> "Shine your light on him," Claire commanded. "On his head. Now!" <nl> Rob fumbled with his thickening fingers until the beam spread over the small boy. The side of his head was dented, as if someone had punched cardboard, and their fist had gone all the way through. <nl> Claire felt Michael's wrist for a pulse. <nl> *Nothing.* <nl> Scorching tears screamed down her cheeks. <nl> She put her mouth to his and breathed. She knew it was hopeless, but she couldn't stop herself. She had to save him. She *had* to. Then, she pumped his chest with her palms. "Come on, please come back to us, Mike. Please!" <nl> After a short fruitless time had passed, Rob dragged her away from the body. "Claire. He's gone. Look at him -- there's no bringing him back. Shh, shh, it wasn't your fault, okay? You did all you could." <nl> "He... he only came down here because of us. Because of *me*. I invited him. I thought he might find some stupid creatures for his stupid book." <nl> "Shh," he crooned, pulling her into his chest. She barely noticed the fetid smell, or the transformed face. "Listen to me, it wasn't anyone's fault. He chose to come explore this place with us. No one forced him. Not me. Not you." <nl> For a few minutes, she sobbed into Rob's chest. <nl> It was a strange light that disturbed them. <nl> Not white. Grey. Almost black. <nl> "What the..." Rob's voice trailed off. <nl> Claire looked up at him. She followed his eyes and slowly turned around. <nl> "...*Michael*?" she whispered. <nl> The boy's head was caved in. Yet somehow, he was standing. Perfectly still. His head was tilted, almost dangling off his neck. <nl> His eyes were locked on hers. <nl> She didn't need to feel his pulse again, however, to know that he was dead. <nl> --- <nl> Part 2 (it's somewhere down below): https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8imb1k/wp_a_group_of_teens_gets_super_powers_but_none_of/dytf0sv/ <nl> Part 3 (further down) <nl> https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8imb1k/wp_a_group_of_teens_gets_super_powers_but_none_of/dythm0u/ <nl> If I do any more, it will be over on my sub: /r/nickofnight <nl> Thanks for reading :) <eos>

<sos> From her understanding, air pressure was regulated by temperature. Or at the very least, air density certainly was. And, somehow, as the hot air lost density it would move. So then, she imagined like a vacuum, the surrounding cold air would rush to fill the gap. <nl> It was the most basic description of her powers that they had ever given her, and she still didn't quite understand it. She only fully understood that whenever she focused enough on a spot, a light gust of wind would arrive soon after. It was cool, or so she was told on the regular by heroes with fame and capes and cereal boxes. Didn't look that cool from where she was standing. But then again, the cameras were hogging all the good angles. Or at least, that's what she would have called them before today. <nl> Today, all angles had been bad, except for her angle. It had looked like any other day at first, bad guy threatening the world, good guys with huge biceps standing up to him. The usual. And as *per* usual, she had been there to make them look good. Pays the bills and all that. However, this time something had gone wrong. With the risk of sounding overdramatic one might even say *horribly* wrong. <nl> Before she even knew what had happened, she found herself under a piece of rubble. She was bruised, confused, and, she suspected, at least lightly concussed. But more than that, she was disturbed at the hot and wet sensation across her suit. Blood. She panicked for a moment before the realization struck her that it wasn't hers. <nl> Around her, tossed like ragdolls, hundreds of bodies lay stationary. Pools of deep, dark crimson spraying the surroundings in a horrific pantomime of abstract paintings. Heroes, reporters, bystanders, the slaughter was free of discrimination. And, slowly rolling across the devastation like a soft breeze across the plains, came instead a dry fit of laughter. <nl> He hadn't seen her yet, too busy basking in his own destruction to bother even glancing her way. But he would, and she knew that when he did, she would be dead. And more than anything else in that moment, she wanted to live. But she wouldn't, not this time. Not when the greatest heroes she had ever seen were cracked open like coconuts on the pavement. She was the only one left. <nl> So in one last desperate act of defiance, she did what she had always done. She focused. But this time, she focused fully on him, not the air in front of him. And she watched him slowly turn around to face her, a fiendish grin spreading across his face as he lifted his hand-- <nl> --and began to scream. Grasping his chest he fell down on his knees as his lungs were burning up without a fire, scalded from the inside and cutting his horrific yell short. Scalding hot steam exited through his orifices, burning out his eyes from their sockets. With his last nightmarish motion, the scalded husk of a man reached out one hand in desperation toward her, before collapsing onto the ground. <nl> She was shaking, her eyes tearing up as the scent reached her nostrils and she tried her hardest not to retch. She failed. She had killed him, but more than that she had watched him die. But the most oppressive thought was one that stuck with her even as the paramedics pulled her out of the pool of blood and vomit. One that persisted even as a medal was hung around her neck to the sound of uproarious applause. Ultimately, no matter how many people had died that day, she was glad to be alive. <eos>

<sos> "250 Richard's Street, April 5th!" <nl> A narrow suburban street, aimed north and curving slightly west. A baker in the middle of the block. They make fantastic jam doughnuts. Good cake too. On one corner is a wine shop. They sell the finest vintages. The rest of the street is made up of houses, solid and bright affairs with well kept gardens. <nl> Your hair is long and black. Your beard is short and sparse. You sit, eyes darting where they may, on the bench by the bus stop. <nl> Your hair is short. You have no beard. You lean on the post by the bus stop, nervously eating a doughnut. You have trouble standing still. <nl> Your hair is greying. You pace the street, enjoying a doughnut. Your full beard is dotted with raspberry jam. <nl> You spot a woman. Young, black hair, thin. She paces down the street, looking into every window she passes, into every one of the tranquil gardens. You stare. You gape. Then your face falls. It could be her. She could be right there! <nl> But after 20 years, you no longer remember her face. <nl> "250 Richard's Street, April 5th!" <nl> A boring street. The jam doughnuts sold in the grimy bakery are too sweet, the gardens are plain and all the same. The wine is bloody expensive and sours in your mouth. 20 years wasted for a love that never came, 20 years poisoned by the longing. 20 years you could have used better, tried harder. 20 years lost to time and a forgotten dream. <nl> Edit: spelling mistake <eos>

<sos> Singing, right? It was probably singing. Innocuous, generally cheerful, and a totally normal reason to wake up famous in a giant fucking mansion and have everyone revere me for something I. Can't. Remember. <nl> Okay. Here's the lowdown. Two weeks ago, I woke up in a stranger's bed, in a stranger's home. As a 24\-year\-old not completely ugly woman, my initial reaction was complete and utter panic. I startled out of the bed so quickly that I nearly broke my ankle. But I was still wearing all of my pjs from the night before, and it was a freaking Wednesday--I haven't gone out on a Wednesday since my days in uni. <nl> Then shit got really, really strange. <nl> My phone was plugged in next to me, fully charged. Three photographs were hanging above the bed. A picture of me with my parents, a picture of me with my little brother, and a picture of me with Jeffers, my lovely border collie. The bedroom was decorated perfectly--just the right amount of white and black, clean vases with white flowers on two bed stands, an alarm clock right next to me reading 9:43, and a splash of color on the curtains by the window. And then Jeffers ran up to me and jumped up on the bed, snuggling right in as if he had lived here for all of his 24.5 dog years. I mean, seriously. I just about threw up. <nl> The rest of the house shared the immaculate qualities of the bedroom. And it was massive. A media room, hottub, pool, master bedroom, giant kitchen, tasteful living room, and a wine cellar I could get lost in. It was morning outside, so I didn't feel quite so spooked walking through the house, especially because the natural light seemed to reach every nook. Also, my name was everywhere. "Tara Wick" read the plaque above the stove. I found another one in the office above my desktop computer. And again, in the wine cellar, *on the freaking labels of all the bottles.* Some of them dated back to the 1980s. They all had the same design, like a seal had been commissioned to my name, and I had just decided to put it everywhere. It was definitely way too tacky for my liking, but I had more pressing issues, like "what the fuck is going on?" and also "no, really, what the fuck is going on?" I also found the "Tara Wick" on the car keys which I discovered in the exact drawer where I would have chosen to put them. The car keys to a red Huracan Spyder Lamborghini. My dream car, worth around $265,000, which I soon found sitting unlocked in the garage. <nl> What does a normal person do in that situation? I honestly don't know, but I can tell you what I did. I sat in the car for ten minutes. I pressed the power button and listened to it roar to life, a truly hormone inducing purr. Then, I turned around, walked back to the kitchen, and tried to catch my breath. Jeffers brought me his food bowl, and I began to act on autopilot. The pantry was easy to find; I got Jeffers his two scoops of kibble from his normal brand with the same cup I had used the day before in my tiny one\-person apartment. Right as I was about to put down the bowl on the Jeffers' very same dog towel, a woman walked in. <nl> "Good morning--" she said. <nl> "Bloody Fucking Christ who the hell are you?" I responded, dropping the dog food everywhere and nearly peeing myself from surprise. Jeffers didn't mind the mess and began to eat. <nl> "I'm Jessica, your personal assistant," Jessica replied. Brunette. Probably three years older than me, but definitely prettier. Her hair was straight and silky. I instinctively put a hand up to my black curls. "You have a very busy schedule today, Tara. Would you like me to tell you your schedule?" <nl> "Uh. Sure." I said. <nl> "At 11:00, you have a meeting with Sir David Attenborough for tea. Don't eat too much, you'll be seeing Sir Ian McKellen at 12:30 for lunch. You'll have time for a quick nap, and then its dinner with the American Ambassador. They want to talk about bringing in some higher ups to potentially meet you, but it's a little bit of a drive, so we will have an escort for you, of course. Oh, and Eden Hazard has asked to take you clubbing tonight. Made a sizeable contribution to our charity, too. I penciled him in, but just leave whenever you want to. All of those soccer players are harmless." Jessica seemed so very calm. <nl> "Can you, maybe, repeat that? A little bit slower?" I asked. Jessica simply nodded sympathetically. <nl> "I know you are stressed about seeing the Queen tomorrow, but don't worry! It will actually be quite easy. They gave you the whole day, it will be so much less running around than usual, you'll see," Jessica said. "Go hop in the shower, Tara. I'll pick out all the outfits you'll need for the day while you are in there." <nl> What does a normal person do in that situation? I still don't know. But I showered. I got dressed in a stylish blazer for my meeting with Sir David Attenborough. And then I drove there, in a Lamborghini which apparently belonged to me, with the coordinates that Jessica had provided. After David offered me a surprisingly gracious hug, as if he had known for years, and called me "Tara, darling," we sat down. <nl> I came right out with it. "Sir David--" <nl> "Please, call me David." <nl> "David, please. What the hell is going on? I'm not famous, but this morning I woke up in a strange hou--" David cut me off with loud, forced laughter. Then he shook his head slowly at me and brought a finger to his lips. There was a deep sadness in his eyes. <nl> "So, you were going to ask me about my favorite documentary series?" David asked. What could I have done? Bullied one of England's most famous figures and loved grandfathers into giving me the information I required? I let it go. We had a conversation about nature. I'd ask Ian McKellen. <nl> But Ian McKellen gave me a similar response, even more visceral, the fear palpable on his face. I didn't trust the American Ambassador, a Woody Johnson fellow who seemed overly interested in when the President of the United States was going to get to meet me. And when I tried to casually ask Eden Hazard how he knew me, he pretended that he didn't understand English. <nl> Two weeks passed this way. My every need was catered for, but I was kept so busy that I couldn't find anytime to actually be alone. When I tried to call any of my old friends, or my family, I got no response. Texting was the same. I was a prisoner, in the nicest prison the world had ever constructed, meeting amazing, world\-famous people every single day. But I definitely wasn't happy. And ever since my date with Eden Hazard, I knew that I had to escape. <nl> I decided to take Jeffers for a midnight stroll. I knew that as soon as I left the house, they would be after me, but I still paused as soon as I left the door of my mansion. Every street light was on, but not a single house had any lights on inside. Too quiet. <nl> Jeffers and I walked for 30 seconds, and then lunged into a sprint, rounding the corner of the suburb and ducking down into a wooded pond area by the side of the road. The sirens started almost immediately, and I could hear movement behind me. <nl> "Jeffers, let's play fetch, okay buddy?" I said, removing his special orange ball full of treats. "Go get it!" I whisper yelled, and I threw with all my might. Then I moved in the other direction, ducking behind two trees. Jeffers barked happily through the cool air, and as soon as he began to do so, I heard men and women begin to shout. "Tara? Is that you? What are you doing out so late?" Jessica. <nl> "We cannot lose her." Another woman. I recognized the voice. Surely...not Theresa May? <nl> "Tara? Where are you? We just want to keep you safe." A man's voice. <nl> And then another, directly below me. <nl> "What if she gets away?" Another man. His arms were held in front of him, as if holding a gun, but it was difficult to see for sure. The figure of his friend held a similar posture. <nl> "We would know," the man's friend responded. "Tara can't get away. She's the cure." <eos>

<sos> Grand magistrate Vield looked down from his raised stand into the courtroom. A child stood in the defendant's stand, accused of murder. She glared down at the desk in front of her. Her representative had ignored her for the entire course of the proceedings, shuffling papers to and fro and making a big show of not doing very much. <nl> "Do you know this woman?" The prosecutor directed the court's attention to a portrait of a woman in her mid\-thirties. <nl> "Yes." The girl barely looked up, her lips were tensed into a tight line. <nl> "This is your mother, correct?" The prosecutor turned to face the girl, an inquisitive look in her eyes. <nl> "No." <nl> Vield tapped a cane against a small gong, indicating that she had told a lie. <nl> "Step\-mother." The girl glared up toward Vield and emphasized the first part, as if that were the most important part of the word. <nl> "And, you killed this woman, is that correct? By letting the car run fumes into the house?" <nl> The case was relatively cut and dry. The girl had killed the woman in a premeditated fashion, and she showed no physical signs of abuse. It couldn't be passed off as self defense. The brother, sitting in the audience, younger than the girl, had shown severe signs of abuse. He could have perhaps gotten away with self\-defense, but not her. <nl> "Yes." <nl> Vield tapped the gong. Both the girl and the prosecutor looked up in surprise. Vield's face remained expressionless. <nl> The woman had a long history of irresponsibility going back to her early twenties when she figured out that drinking was easier than a life of struggle and discipline. Vield didn't mind that at all, people had a right to conduct themselves any way they wanted, in his mind. The problem had come when she had introduced children into the mix and put her problems on them. <nl> The prosecutor regained their composure, splitting the questions into parts. "Did you start the car in the garage?" <nl> "Yes." <nl> Silence. <nl> The prosecutor went on. "Did you kill this woman?" <nl> "Yes." <nl> The gong sounded again. The little girl looked up at Vield, confused. Vield stared straight ahead, unblinking. <nl> The woman smoked two packs a day and lived in a rathole. The coroners had only determined that she died of asphyxiation. The car had been off, and out of gas, when emergency responders arrived at the scene, the carbon monoxide levels were high, but that wasn't definitive. Even the blood carbon monoxide levels weren't out of comprehension considering she smoked. There could be any number of 'causes,' mold in the air conditioner, a slight gas leak, freon seeping out of the fridge. It could even have been a rogue burglar with a pillow for all anyone knew. <nl> "This is\-\-" the prosecutor paused\-\- "this is most unexpected, your honor, we have motive, we have the cause of death we\-\-" <nl> The gong rang out, interrupting the prosecutor. <nl> "We... don't have the cause of death." <nl> Silence. <nl> "Right. We ask for a continuation, your honor, to review the reports." <nl> Vield stood without saying a word and left the chamber. <nl> "That little girl's been through enough," he thought to himself. "No need to burden her with a life in prison and the guilt of a death. No, the world would be better served giving her and her brother a new start in life." He couldn't change the facts entirely, but he could do his best to help this little girl. <eos>

<sos> Mara squinted into the too-bright sunlight, shading her eyes. <nl> "Come on, now," the man beside her said with a chuckle.  "They're in a bit of a hurry.  Don't want to get left behind, eh?" <nl> She eyed him for a long moment - Calum.  That was his name.  Defender, sixth rank.  The identification rose up in her mind, his classification and credentials from the Guild of Assistance. <nl> He was right, though.  The merchants *were* getting ahead of her, while she stared up into the mid-morning light.  They were supposed to be bodyguarding the rich, paranoid Yenarrans, not dawdling.  She pulled herself back to attentiveness with a groan, jogging forward to take her place by his side. <nl> "This is your first job, right?" Calum said, his voice low.  His blue eyes were fixed on the cliffs around their little group, watching with practiced caution. <nl> Mara nodded, one hand sliding down to rest apprehensively on the hilt of a dagger crossed behind her hips.  "...Right.  I appreciate your band taking me on, by the way."  She meant it.  It was hard for a rookie to find work worth a damn, work that wouldn't leave them dead on the roadside. <nl> "Well, we all start somewhere," Calum said, offering her a crooked smile.  "You're my responsibility for this venture, so stick close."  He rapped his knuckles against the heavy wood-and-steel shield he carried, smile widening.  "The front line can be a bit of a nightmare - especially when you've got no defenses, hmm?  But you'll be fine." <nl> No defenses.  Right.  Mara smiled tightly, remembering her role in all this. <nl> She was a Rogue - a trickster, a blade-wielder who specialized in herbs and poisons and subtlty.  She repeated the phrase over and over to herself, etching it into her mind.  That's what her paperwork said.  Making it say that had been *quite* expensive, but it was worth it. <nl> If anyone realized the truth, her life was forfeit. <nl> Marsk was a rugged, unforgiving country.  The whole place was covered in towering mountains and dense, lightless jungles, filled with monsters that would as soon eat you as run away.  There wasn't a damn thing worth having there - the effort of actually getting at any of it wasn't worth the lives it would cost. <nl> Marsk had found a different export, instead.  People. <nl> The Guild of Assistance had been inevitable, when you looked at it like that.  Oh, they called it that, but she knew what it really was - the bastardized offspring of the ancient guilds of Fighters, Mages, and Merchants.  It had seemed like the simplest option, benefitting all three offshoots. <nl> The Mages assessed and supported.  The fighters....fought.  And the merchants assigned. <nl> Thanks to their efforts, the Mercenaries of Marsk were known worldwide as ruthless, relentless, and unflinchingly effective.  There was just one, simple downside. <nl> Mara wanted no part in the Guild's machinations. <nl> It had sounded good in theory - the Guild would assess you as a child, find where your skills well and truly lay.  And that was that - your assignment for life.  Oh, you could opt for a different profession, give up on becoming a Ranger and settle down with a farm somewhere.  But farming Marsk wasn't exactly *profitable*, was it?  That was simply a way to wind up dead faster, eaten by the local beasts. <nl> Her eyes snapped up, drawn out of her musings as a rock cascaded down the cliffside around them.  The other fighters in their Guild-organized band fell silent in a single, disciplined second, scanning their surroundings. <nl> "Close, now," Calum said, his voice little more than a mutter.  He slid his blade out slowly, stepping towards the rockfall. <nl> The merchants were beginning to yell, fear and anxiety coloring their tones.  Mara didn't spare them a glance.  Her dagger was in her hand, held crosswise with her free hand ready. <nl> Where?  Where were they? <nl> Her green eyes snapped over as the gully alongside them erupted into motion.  The raiders leapt out from under their hiding place with a bellow, laughing and yelling in a cacophany of noise. <nl> Calum  was already there, shield at the ready.  Arrows sprayed around him as Kenna, the party's Marksman, began firing shot after unrelenting shot from her vantage point. <nl> "Come on!" the Defender called to her, grinning back over his shoulder. <nl> She swallowed the nerves that jumped in her throat, surging in after him. <nl> It was her moment of truth, wasn't it? <nl> Her blade scythed out, just as she'd practiced.  The raider's blows were nearly too fast for her to follow as she closed in on him, but she was faster.  She slid past him, eyes wide with razor-sharp focus. <nl> She'd practiced.  She'd spent so damn long practicing - and she'd prove the Guild wrong. <nl> Mara was finally close enough.  A grin tugged at the corners of her mouth as she stared at her target.  Calum and the other fighters were all around her, keeping the front lines under control.  They were there to shield her if she got in too deep - but would they just be a liability, instead? <nl> Would they see? <nl> She forced the nerves away, banishing the fears.  No one would see - because no one would ever expect to see. <nl> No one would ever expect to see a mercenary going against the Guild.  Why would they?  Going against the Guild would be going against your talents, and that would be putting your whole party at risk.  The Guild responded to that...*poorly*.  It wasn't a quick end. <nl> Mara didn't care.  She wasn't a *healer*.  The assignment had rankled from the very start.  It was unfair - and she wasn't going to let it limit her. <nl> Her palm slammed into the man's chest, even as her dagger dug into his arm.  That's all anyone would see - she cut him. <nl> They'd never see the way she tapped into his life itself. <nl> It was a part of life for healers.  They'd lend their own life-force, or encourage that of their patients.  It was *expected*. <nl> She'd been surprised, when she found the torn pages tucked inside the cookbook she'd bought years back.  The poor merchant had probably never known what he carried, what he *smuggled*. <nl> The technique was almost certainly forbidden.  She didn't care. <nl> Power flooded her veins as she took the man's life in her hand.  He flinched, the color draining from his face as she smiled up at him. <nl> Healers helped.  They gave. <nl> She *took.*  And she'd keep taking until she had enough to carve her *own* legend into the world. <nl> The man fell at her feet, bleeding from her slash but already lifeless.  She cut his throat anyway.  Had to keep up appearances, after all. <nl> Calum and the others were still fighting - completely unaware. <nl> She smiled, feeling the man's life coursing through her veins. <nl> And then she leaped back into the fray. <nl> (/r/inorai, critique always welcome!) <nl> --- <nl> Edit - as stated below, I'm honestly pretty intrigued by this setting.  The thing standing in my way is that I'm trying to finalize two novels to publish next week (keep an eye out on WP) and I have an ongoing serial that is now quite behind due to, again, trying to get those ready XD I can already hear the screaming that would begin if I started something new. <nl> But I really like this setting.

<sos> The scythe came down and another man fell. The scythe came down and another man fell. The scythe came down and another man fell. <nl> Slowly, casually, the Red Lady of death unfurled her clothes and checked over the inky red list, surveying the wreckage in front of her. Her steed glinted in the fading light of the apocalypse, its headlights burning holes through the infernal smog surrounding her. <nl> "Hmmm... It looks like nobody else here will die today..." She mused, tapping the blunt of her scythe against her cheek. <nl> A bullet ricocheted off of her cheek and hit the pavement, scattering bits of rock and solidified tar. Then another. Then another. A hail of bullets descended upon her position and bullets broke and shattered across her armor, breaking before the indomitable will of fate. She turned slowly and followed the passage where it had come from, then mounted her bike. Ignoring the road, it climbed through the air, revving, wheel rolling towards the distant buildings. <nl> Then she hopped off, lazily, and the air acted like a solid surface, letting her stroll up to the twentieth floor of the skyscraper and walk in front of the sniper, rifle gleaming as he frantically fumbled the reload. <nl> "Why do you fight me?" She asked, her face as dispassionate as ever. "I am the natural progression of things. I can understand fighting War. That diminishes me. I can understand fighting Famine. That diminishes me. I can understand fighting Plague. That diminishes me. But at the end of the day, that is all I will become. When you eliminate the other three, I will still be standing at the end of the day." <nl> The sniper threw his rifle up in her direction and fired. Lazily, the scythe flicked out and split the bullet in half, both sides passing nimbly around her. <nl> "I fight you for the same reason the body fights a cancer," The soldier said, flatly. "Because I acknowledge we will all die..." <nl> The scythe cleaved down the rifle with a spray of hot metal and gun steel, hitting an unprepared bullet and sparking off a miniature explosion. The wrecked weapon tumbled to the ground from his hands. "But I will fight you for every additional second I can have." <nl> "You will?" The Red lady pried. <nl> "We all will." <nl> "You know... I've hit my quota for the day," The Red lady said, languidly, flicking out her scythe. "But you amuse me. I'm sure the heavenly host will understand if I take a few more souls today..." <nl> The soldier flicked out his knife and brought it up and the scythe flashed without her touching it, pressing against his knife. <nl> Her face, pretty, dispassionate, staring down at his like the end of his rifle had looked at her. Through a scope. Pretty as a picture. <nl> "How strong does your will have to be to fight against the inevitable?" She asked, playfully, pressing the scythe down harder and harder against the precariously balanced blade. <nl> His muscles strained as he stared forward, knowing this was his last stand, and yet he did not accept it. Could not accept it. <nl> That was the nature of humans. <nl> The knife shattered and the man was cleaved in two. Both meaty halves fell onto the ground of the destroyed penthouse apartment, a violation of policy so grand that he would've been evicted if the Red Lady hadn't killed the manager last week. <nl> She sighed, stood up from checking his body and taking his soul and moved to leave. His identity was still in tact. They'd be able to identify his body. Her job was done, and she should rejoin the others... and yet... <nl> "Stop," His voice called out. <nl> She paused at the unnatural sound and slowly craned her head around to look at him. <nl> Slowly, his body zipped back together, cells joining one by one, bones unbreaking. Heart refusing. Brain pieced back together from where the blade had cleaved through. <nl> Two antlers poured out from his bones. <nl> "You have taken enough, New one," The thing that had once been the soldier said. <nl> "On the contrary," The Red lady said, flicking the scythe around in her hands. "I think you'll find that I'll have only taken enough when I take my own life at the end of time. It is my duty and my purpose to take and take and take. Is that not what your fabled capitalism says, man?" <nl> "I am older than your ideas of economics," The man said, stepping towards her. "And I am older than your romanticization of death." <nl> "I am hardly a romanticization. I am a manifestation, cold, clear. Perfect for my purpose." <nl> "In a younger age we called you a cynic," The old god said. <nl> "In a younger age things were more chaotic, and the blood of the gods was what weaned me," The Red Lady said, crooning slightly. "Is it time for the blood of the gods to flow once more?" <nl> "No, my dearest child," The Deer God said, and his voice sounding like the thousands of species that had once walked the earth, calling out at once. His human form splintered and burnt under the weight of his manifestation, calling from somewhere deeper and darker than the Red Lady had thought about in many years. <nl> "It's time for a final proving. We did not consent to your apocalypse..." <nl> "I do not consent to your testing." The red lady returned, playful. <nl> "Then we have an agreement." <nl> ----- <nl> https://www.reddit.com/r/Zubergoodstories/ for more like this, go here friends! <nl> You guys want a part 2? https://www.reddit.com/r/Zubergoodstories/comments/8k4xlk/death_walks_gods_wake_part_2/ Click here for part 2 <eos>

<sos> ######[](#dropcap) <nl> "DO NOT LEAVE TOWN TODAY." <nl> At first, the rule didn't raise any eyebrows. There was nothing particularly unusual about it, one of the same ones along the lines of "Don't go into the forest," or "Don't buy the bakery's bread." No one really knew how the rules appeared on the side of Abe's barn every day, but the town prophet had foreseen that if anyone didn't follow the rules, the entire town of Wolford would be punished. <nl> So it was sort of like God's commandment, if you will. <nl> And the rules were never terrible. Oh, sure, they could get a little inconvenient at times, like this one, but it was always only for a day and quite easily avoidable. <nl> Or so everyone thought, including Libby, who had lived in the town her entire life. <nl> Until the next day, the rule was the same. <nl> "DO NOT LEAVE TOWN TODAY." <nl> Panic ensued as all the members of the community gathered in front of the dripping red paint on the barn door. <nl> "How is this possible?" Tom asked, stricken. "I need to go out and sell milk today, or it'll go bad soon." <nl> "Same," Bradford huffed through his mustache. "I need to buy flour and other materials to keep running the bakery." <nl> "This has never happened before," Cindy added. She clutched at the small baby she held in her arms, her eyes wide. "Should we ask Sylvia what to do?" <nl> Voices began overlapping and talking over each other when, as Libby was watching the red paint, still wet, suddenly had a thought. "What if this is a practical joke? How do we know Sylvia's prophecies are even correct?" <nl> A hush fell over the crowd as dozens of pairs of eyes stared at her. Libby shrunk in front of the glares. It seemed a valid question. After all, Sylvia hadn't really gotten anything right before, and everyone had viewed her as a quack until the command "Don't laugh" appeared on the wall, and some did, and then that night, the town was visited by a swarm of locusts. Sylvia claimed it was God's command. <nl> But couldn't it all have been a coincidence? The prophet now had the townsfolk lined up in front of her door every morning--bartering items in hand--to have their fortunes told. <nl> "Don't talk as if you know anything. You're still young," Bradford grunted. <nl> "I'm 23," Libby shot back. "Old enough to question whether we might be following some jokester's rule." <nl> "Libby!" Her mother appeared at the back and grabbed at her arm. She bowed and looked apologetically at the rest of the group. "She's still young, and she doesn't understand the rules, that's all." <nl> "Momma! Don't apologize!" <nl> "You better teach her to watch her mouth, darlin'. She's gonna get in huge trouble one day runnin' it like that." <nl> Libby glared at the bartender. Bradford had always been crude and leery, and she was certain he had something for her mother. <nl> "I will," her mother said. Then she dragged Libby away from the crowd. "You know you shouldn't say things like that." <nl> "But momma, it's all backwards. This thinking, it's like we're stuck in the middle ages or something." She had wanted to speak up on the issue for forever, but her mother had curbed her tongue, telling her it was no use. And it hadn't really affected her. Not until now. <nl> Her mother's face was pale. "It's okay. We can just leave tomorrow. It's no big deal." <nl> They had been planning to leave the town for a little while now. Her mother wanted more opportunities for her, and she had gotten sick of staying in this place where everyone still subscribed to superstition. But, she supposed, they could wait for a day. <nl> Until the next day, the rule hadn't changed. <nl> She stared at the paint, dried, on the wall. <nl> For whatever reason, whoever--mortal or not--had been painting the command on the barn door hadn't been by, and she intended to find out why. <nl> ***** <nl> [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8kmd2z/wp_there_is_only_one_rule_in_your_village_and_it/dz9tiry/) below! <nl> r/AlannaWu <eos>

<sos> She sweated nervously, both her hands clenching the heavy broadsword, waiting for her doom. She could barely lift the damn thing, let alone fight with it. The only weapon she had any killing experience with was a fly swatter. <nl> The alien crowd in the stands cheered raucously as the sound of the gates mechanisms started, pulling the heavy spiked gates upwards.  She was going to die. <nl> The other prisoners had told her their Alien captors delighted in pairing up one of the smartest creature from a planet with one of  the meanest creature from a planet. So she was expecting to see a grizzly bear or a wolverine, something big and grumpy like that, the last thing she expected to see was her orange Maine Coon cat Fluffykins come running up to her. <nl> The crowd roared as the cat raced at her and leaped into her arms, causing her to drop the sword. They thought it was ripping her throat out, and while Fluffykins was biting her, he was giving her demanding love bites. <nl> As the crowd fell silent in shock a low rumbling sound filled the room, and she realized it was the sound of her pet's purring being broadcast across the stadium. <nl> Not knowing what to do now, and assuming they'd probably just kill them both for ruining the evening's entertainment, she decide to enjoy some cuddles while she could. <nl> She was busy giving belly rubs to Fluffykins as the cat lounged in pure feline joy when a smaller door next to the spiked gates opened up. A procession of about a dozen of the tall aliens approached. It was hard to describe them as they were fully clothed in long loose robes with even their eyes obscured (assuming they had eyes?). Their robes were an off grey colour that almost seemed to shift in tone if she looked too long, absorbing light so that you found yourself squinting to see better to no avail. <nl> As they approached she drew her knees up to her chest. This was it. They are going to kill us, she thought. <nl> Fkuffykins leaped up, putting himself between her and the aliens, his hackles raised, a low rumbling growl replaced the purr. She'd never seen him like this before. The aliens stopped their approach. Fluffykins lowered his growl but didn't budge. She'd heard Maine coons could be as protective as a dog but this was the first she'd seen such behaviour from him. <nl> The aliens huddled in heated discussion. If she didn't know better she might think they were....afraid...of her? Finally one approached her, alone, its companions waiting near the door. <nl> "Chosen ones, we beg your forgiveness. We have been looking for so long for the One Who Would Tame the Beasts." The Alien bowed his head deferentially. "The last thing we expected was to find you here, on a planet overrun by primitive bipeds barely out of their first Industrial Age" <nl> The alien dropped to its knees before her and pulled back its hood, revealing the head of what looked like a large human sized crow. It's companions further back joined suit. <nl> "Please forgive us for. We need your help. Only you can tame the great star beast." <nl> "Oh shit Fluffykins, what have we gotten ourselves into now?" She thought just as a beam of light surrounded them both and lifted them up into the alien sky above. <eos>

<sos> I pulled the pillow down hard over my head, but it didn't do much to drown out the ruckus wafting up from the dining room below. I winced too, when I heard the sound of cutlery scattering, plates shattering. Then, loud thumps, probably one of them pushing the other against the wall. More howls, more wordless cries of anger. <nl> Then, suddenly, silence. <nl> I crept to the door, tilted it open so that it wouldn't creak. I even peeked through the balustrades, but they were both gone. I sighed, then headed down to help with cleaning up. It was easier this way. They always apologized afterwards, swearing that they did not mean to cause trouble for me again, but I honestly did not mind. As long as we could- <nl> Blood. Fresh droplets, sprayed in a clear arc on the tabletop. This close, I did not even need to Shift to know that they were from mum. <nl> Axe. Usually stowed in the rack next to the fireplace, now missing. I narrowed my eyes, and the disturbed dust particles in the air painted the rest of the picture for me. Dad, probably, had retrieved the weapon in a frenzy. <nl> Wind. A chilly gust, swirling through the house as brazenly as an uninvited guest, alerted me to the front door, now hanging ajar. Footprints leading out, framed by porcelain chips from the ravaged dinnerware, made clear where my parents had went. <nl> *This was no ordinary fight,* I thought. *Shit.* <nl> I sprinted out, drawing in as much of the night air as my lungs would allow. In my human form, I had perhaps one-hundredth of the capabilities afforded to me when I Shifted, but I was still a clear cut above my unpowered human brethren. Their scents became apparent to me, hanging in the air like a trail of fireflies. Dad's scent was stronger, overpowering even, full of anger and rage and potent impotence. Mum's scent was... too faint to make out. <nl> No matter, they had to be together. <nl> My feet carried me across the fields. My heart burned with fatigue, but I didn't dare to stop. There was no plan, of course. I was barely ten, and definitely not strong enough to stop dad if I had to. Even if there were a full moon tonight, it wouldn't have mattered.   I could only hope that he would listen to reason. It was the only weapon I had. <nl> Then, at the edge of the forest, where the bristling trees were thickest, I saw dad raise his axe high above his head, priming for the swing. The scarce moonlight was enough to illuminate his fury for me. <nl> "Dad! Stop! Dad, please!" <nl> I tumbled at the last few paces, rolling into a ball, stopping at his feet. The tears were ready to spring from my eyes, the pleas all prepared in my throat. They always fought, but they always came back together, so why shouldn't they do so again this time? Why make choices which cannot be reversed? <nl> "Rania? What the... Get up, you twit. What are you doing here?" <nl> Dad hoisted me to my feet. I could still smell the anger roiling off him, but it was controlled, not a conflagration consuming him, but a modest flame burning in a lamp. My eyes darted around, searching for what I was sure was mum, lying on the ground, wounded, bleeding out. <nl> I saw only firewood. <nl> "Dad? Where's... Mum?" <nl> "How should I know? Geez, that crazy coot can go fall off a cliff for all I care!" <nl> "But... I thought... You were chasing her, with your axe, and I thought... Well, maybe, that you were..." <nl> Dad looked down at the axe in his hand, then back at me before he burst into laughter. "What, you thought I was chopping down your mum with *this*? Ain't nothing less than Odin's Spear will pierce that mangy hide of hers!" <nl> "But then why... Why are you..." <nl> Dad pointed at the woodchips on the ground. "Your mum said the firewood I brought in had spores in them, set off her allergies something bad. I told her she was more fragile than a chihuahua, and that was more than enough to set her off." <nl> "... And the blood?" <nl> "Aye, that was me. I flung the plates at her, and I forgot her reflexes are shit when she ain't Shifted. Might have cut her hand or something." <nl> Dad watched me stew in the uncomfortable silence for a few moments longer before he turned back to the tree, aiming precise strokes at the trunk. I took a few steps back, away from the debris flying into the air, then found a dry spot to sit down on. <nl> "Why can't you talk to her like you do with me, dad?" I asked. "Calm and all. Taking your time to explain things." <nl> "That woman drives me nuts, you know that. I do my fair share at making her mad too, I know, I know." <nl> "Then maybe you two wouldn't fight so much, you know? And you could enjoy more of life together, and not have to spend so much of it apart, like now." <nl> Dad dropped the axe, then started bundling his haul together. Two quick loops with twine later, he had a hefty bundle which he carried over his shoulder. <nl> "You've seen us run during the full moons, Rania. No greater love exists for me then, or ever will elsewhere. And if the price of that is that I've got to tolerate her foolishness for the rest of the month... Then I'd gladly do that. I can only hope she feels the same way." <nl> I took his outstretched hand, and we began our trek back to our home. We walked in silence for a while longer, then I caught a whiff of stew on the wind. Onions, celery, black pepper, beef. In the distance, I saw the lights spilling out of our kitchen. <nl> Dad's favourite supper was only minutes away. <nl> "Will you at least try to be nicer to each other?" <nl> "Rania, if I hadn't watched you being born myself, I could have sworn that you were an old woman stitched into the body of a child." <nl> "Dad! I'm being serious!" <nl> Dad sighed, then lunged forward in the darkness. He swiped a clod of earth from the ground, then revealed the prize he was going for - a handful of chrysanthemums, slightly traumatized but otherwise perky. <nl> "This good enough for her, you think?" <nl> I grinned. "It's a start," I said. <nl> --- <nl> /r/rarelyfunny <eos>

<sos> Chelsea struggled against the rope bindings, but that only made them bite harder into her wrists and ankles. "Let me go!" she screamed at Raven, who stood by the window, the breeze throwing her auburn hair back in waves against her shoulders. In her hands was a piece of paper she was folding into a tiny origami bird. <nl> "Chelsea, please. You know how it goes: you behave, and I don't hurt you. When Jaxson turns up and falls into my little trap, I let you go. All safe and sound." <nl> Chelsea took a deep breath. Raven's perfume wafted to her, carried by the breeze from the window. That sweet familiar scent of crumbling biscuits. She'd put on more than usual, today. Her face, as always, was disguised by the mask with the long twisted beak. It used to frighten Chelsea. She could imagine it dipping into a person's stomach, like a vulture, then coming out painted red. Raven didn't scare her any more, though. She might be strong, but she'd never hurt Chelsea when abducting her; maybe she'd been a little rough at times, but she was somehow also gentle. The entire ordeal was more an inconvenience, these days, than anything else. <nl> "But it *never* happens that way, Raven. Jaxson always sees through your dumb-ass traps. He always rescues me -- you never let me go." <nl> Raven lay the completed paper bird down on the windowsill.  "Yeah? Well, not this time. I'll be the one setting you free today." <nl> That was an odd way to phrase it, Chelsea thought. <nl> "So what have you got lined up for him? Is this whole apartment rigged to blow up the moment Jaxson enters it?" <nl> "*Tut tut tut*," said Raven, wagging a finger. "No spoilers." <nl> Chelsea raised her eyebrows. "Sorry for asking." <nl> The beak turned away from the window, tilted, and then stared at her. A shiver splashed on Chelsea's neck and ran down her back. It seemed like the mask, or the woman inside the mask, was inspecting her. <nl> "How's work going, Chelsea?" <nl> "W- what? Are you serious?" <nl> "Yes. I'm serious. I want to know how your work's going. I imagine running a little flower shop like that must be... *idyllic*." <nl> "You really want to know?" <nl> "Yes. Really!" <nl> "Well..." Chelsea paused. "Well, not so great, right now, actually. Because I haven't been able to open today, seeing as I was *kidnapped!*" <nl> "Generally, Chelsea. How's work going, in *general*?" <nl> Chelsea could feel a ball of anxiety growing in her stomach. In truth, it wasn't going well. She was barely making enough money to afford the rent, and if things didn't change soon...  Being here was at least a break from the stress. Maybe not a welcome one, but it was a distraction nonetheless. <nl> Chelsea lowered her head. "Fine. I guess." <nl> "You guess?" Raven stepped towards her and lowered herself onto the floor by her side. "That sounds a little ominous, Chelsea. Would you like to talk about it?" <nl> The sweet perfume surrounded her now. There were flowery high notes, too. Rose petal, maybe. "I wouldn't want to distract you from your uh..." <nl> "Come on, tell me about it." <nl> "I don't really want to." <nl> Raven paused. "You're not good enough at the business aspects. Bookkeeping and such. Is that it?" <nl> "No. It's not that, at all," Chelsea replied. <nl> "Oh. Is it that you're deadly allergic to flowers?" <nl> Chelsea almost laughed. "...A few months ago a shop opened up a little way down the street. Flower Pirate." <nl> Raven scoffed. "*Flower Pirate?* Seriously? What kind of name is that?" <nl> "Says *The Raven*", Chelsea mocked. <nl> "Hey! It's just *Raven*, now. And it's a pretty cool name, I think." <nl> "Well anyway, Flower Pirate has a lot of marketing power. They're on tv, in the papers -- all over the place. They sell mainly to the rich and famous. We sell exactly the same things -- even better arrangements, in my opinion. But they price at ten times what we do -- and it sells. Ours doesn't. I think... I think them opening was really the beginning of the end. First nail in the coffin. Simply put, they're trendy, and we're not." <nl> "Beginning of the end? That's..." <nl> Chelsea could feel her eyes welling. "Yeah. It is." <nl> "You okay?" <nl> Chelsea nodded, but a single tear rolled down her cheek. <nl> Raven wiped it away with a gentle finger. She then raised her hands and lifted the mask from off her face.  A woman with dazzling blue eyes, and skin like snow, looked not unkindly at Chelsea. <nl> "Are you... are you going to have to kill me now?" <nl> Raven grinned. "Kill my best hostage? Are you crazy?"  She leaned forward and loosened the ropes around Chelsea's ankles, then undid the ropes around her wrists completely. <nl> Chelsea let Raven take her hand. Let her squeeze it -- *liked* her squeezing it. Her hands were soft but strong. Reassuring. <nl> "Wait," said Chelsea, peering into the woman's deep blue eyes. "I've seen you before--" <nl> "I don't think so." <nl> "Yeah, I have... Oh, you were in the shop! I remember -- you bought like the most expensive bouquet we sell!" <nl> Raven shrugged. "Okay, you caught me. I like pretty flowers. Is that a crime?" <nl> "I guess not. Kidnapping, on the other hand..." <nl> "Hey, listen to me," said Raven. "It's going to be okay. Your shop, I mean." <nl> Chelsea looked down at the floor. "I... I don't think it is." <nl> "What if something were to... *happen* to Flower Pirate?" <nl> Chelsea's eyes went wide. "No! No, I don't want you blowing them up or anything. It's just business." <nl> Raven gritted her teeth, but nodded. "Okay, well what if you moved into a different market. Exotic plants, or something." <nl> "I can't afford exotic plants. I can only source local." <nl> "What if--" <nl> The sound of an explosion in the corridor cut through Raven's words. She fumbled for her mask and hooked it over her face. <nl> But it was too late. <nl> Jaxson was in the room, and the cuffs were around Raven's wrists in a matter of seconds. <nl> As Raven was dragged away, Chelsea caught the beak glance back at her. <nl> She smiled meekly in response. <nl> ~~~~~ <nl> Three weeks passed since Raven had kidnapped Chelsea, and today was a new day for her. A new beginning, even. Because today, she was going to walk into her shop for the final time. <nl> She was going to close it. <nl> She couldn't compete with 'Flower Pirate' any longer, and she'd made up her mind, even if her heart was breaking because of it. <nl> Her keys fell onto the floor as the shop door swung open. "Oh my God," she said as she stared at what should have been a near empty shop. <nl> Hundreds of plants -- rare and exotic and *expensive* -- lined every inch of the shop floor. All in little baskets or pots. "Oh my God," she repeated. <nl> She didn't find out until later, that Raven had escaped her prison two days prior. But the little origami bird sitting on her desk, told her all she needed to know. <nl> That day turned into the busiest day of her professional career, as word of the incredible plants, that snapped and kissed and smelt like heaven, spread through the town, and then into the neighbouring towns. <nl> A week later, a woman with pale skin and auburn hair walked into her store. <nl> The two women soon left together, to visit the quaint little coffee shop opposite. <nl> --- <nl> /r/nickofnight <eos>

<sos> ######[](#dropcap) <nl> Marion clenched her jaw, grinding her teeth together as the domestic jingle echoed  through her small home. An adrenal slurry of frustration began coursing through her veins as she stood to answer the door yet again, resolving once and for all to disconnect that goddamned doorbell. <nl> Walking through the barely controlled chaos of the "living room" - which was also the kitchen, dining room and soon to be baby's bedroom - Marion hewed to the thin trail of soiled carpet carved out from between stacks of spare construction material and tools. Slowly, with careful steps, she made her way to the front door. Her abdomen was huge now, distended out in front of her, nature playing a bad joke on her center of balance, and her knees and lower back ached as though they were ancient and crippled by rheumatism. <nl> The front door was cheap, just like everything else in the house, and everything else in Paddock Junction, population 869, soon to be 870, assuming old man Jacobs didn't drop dead in the next two months. Paddock Junction was an old coal town, in the middle of nowhere Appalachia, abandoned by industry, hope and history alike. The Dollar General and the bail bondsman were the only two businesses in town more than a decade old, and there was talk of the former closing up shop this coming winter. <nl> Nothing of any interest to anyone had happened in Paddock's Junction since before the civil war, when Henry Paddock first founded the township as a minor act of rebellion after a fight with the Mayor of Chattanooga. Since then it was basically down hill for the town, with the exception of the twenty years it took to exhaust the overestimated vein of coal running through the center of Paddock's Peak. <nl> Today there was as close to nothing in Paddock's Junction as any place could reasonably contain while still being considered a "place" at all. <nl> Why, then, yet another visitor was visible behind the small textured glass windows of Marion's front door was a mystery to her, and one which she no longer found endearing. <nl> At first, almost 8 months ago, when people started to show up unannounced in the town, asking after Marion, she had almost been excited. Here were random people suddenly interested in a lonesome widow living in rural Tenessee. <nl> But it soon become an annoyance, and then a source of significant anger. At one point Marion had gone all the way to the public library in Chattanooga and had a librarian search for her name on one of the computers. But the librarian said the search turned up nothing, that Marion's name didn't even come up on the internet not once. <nl> After a few months, Marion began to actively avoid the interlopers. They would stand on her front lawn and take photos of the house, or the mailbox, or selfies in front of the sprawling pear tree Marion's father had planted half a century earlier. <nl> When Marion went to Dollar General they would sometimes be waiting for her, always with there cell phones, eagerly snapping pictures and gaping in her direction. <nl> It was particularly frustrating to her that none of them ever said a word. No matter how much she yelled or antagonized, no one ever spoke to her. On the few occassions when she threatened physical violence the visitors just ran away in silence. <nl> In the last month, as her pregnancy reached it apex and the birth of her son loomed, she had taken to waving guests away with a shotgun. It leaned against the front door, loaded and cocked, at all times of day. <nl> Peering through at the blurred image through the glass of her front door, Marion picked up the shotgun and raised it with some effort half way up, before turning the doorknob and opening the door a crack. <nl> "Who's that? If you come just to look best get the hell off my stoop 'fore I lose my damned temper." <nl> Through the crack of the door, Marion heard a man's voice came back, almost too quiet to hear clearly. "Marion Doharty?" <nl> The visitors never said a word when they came, which set this visit apart. Still holding tightly to the gun, Marion slowly opened the door wider, until she stood face to face with the stranger. "Can I help you?" <nl> The man looked back at her with an inscrutable look, one of grim determination. "I'm sorry Mam." <nl> The apology was a barely audible mumble. Marion was about to ask "what for?" when the man reached into his pocket and removed the strangest looking object, like a Deringer pistol, no bigger than a humming bird, but made of one unbroken piece of matte black material. Before Marion could even register it as a threat, the man raised the small object, aimed it at her face, and activated the trigger. <nl> Things happened quickly. As the small gun came up there was a bright blue flash of light, an inscrutable flurry of sound and movement,  everywhere at once, and when everything was silent and the sunlight returned, the man was no longer on the front porch. He was nowhere to be seen. Marion turned around and saw, not a foot to the left of her head, a gaping, smoldering hole in the side of her house. She lined her face up to it and could see clean through to the poplar tree in the back yard. <nl> She turned back, astonished, unsure what to think, terrified and astounded. The shotgun fell to the floor from her hands and instinctually she placed her palms against her belly. <nl> Marion had no idea what had just happened, except that her life was very nearly ended, along with the life of her unborn son. Somehow, they had survived a threat she did not at all understand by means she understood even less. <nl> The police had no answers for Marion. The random assailant was never found, nor was the weapon he used or any ammunition. No one would have believed anything at all had happened, but for the giant hole in the side of the house. Despite that, no one had the slightest inkling of an explanation. <nl> From that day on Marion received no more strange visitors. Another month passed before the birth of her son, Gedeon. <nl> In the decades and eventually centuries to come, during Gedeon's unnaturally long and terrible reign, many assassins would try their hand at ridding the world of the Tyrant King. Only one would even come close, travelling back to the distant past, carrying a hidden weapon built for the task, even going so far as to take his shot. <nl> Only the radical temporal intervention of the Royal Guard saved the Tyrant King. The unnamed assassin was dragged back to the present, tortured and quartered, his remains sent to the four corners of the Empire. Though his name was stricken from all records, his image eradicated from the annals of time, the *idea* of him became a legend among the downtrodden and forgotten, and he is still celebrated in secret to this day. <nl> ****** <nl> #### For More Legends From The Multiverse <nl> #### r/LFTM <eos>

<sos> **The saddest people smile the brightest.** <nl> It was only when I 'manifested' my mind into my best friend, Irina, that I realized the true meaning behind this quote. <nl> Irina has always been the outgoing, cheery girl. She's the type of person that is constantly overflowed with positive energy. As many would presume, she is often the life of the party. You can physically experience the subtle change in the air as she steps into any environment. <nl> But. <nl> *Why is that I feel such emptiness?* <nl> Not only that... why does my heart feel so heavy? Like I am being dragged down by *something*...? It's as if there is a hidden feeling of bitterness--no--more of a permanent state of melancholy. <nl> *Is this how she really feels all the time?* <nl> *I don't understand.* <nl> *I don't understand it at all.* <nl> "Well?" Irina smiled. A powerful and natural gleaming smile that was contagious and could easily brighten anyone's day. "How did it feel?" <nl> "Different than I expected." <nl> "What do you mean? You have been pestering me about this for weeks and now all you give me is this blank look." Irina teased playfully as she imitated my facial expression then proceeded to poke my cheek repeatedly. "Well, whatever. Like you promised earlier, it's going to cost you that delicious Supreme Deluxe Premium Sundae." <nl> Her mouth began to drool uncontrollably at the thought of the luxurious 20$ ice cream, the ultimate dessert any sweet\-tooth can ask for in this town. <nl> "Um." <nl> *How should I say this?* <nl> "Why is it--" <nl> Irina stopped me midway, shushing me with her index finger. <nl> "I'm really hungry. Let's go eat some ice cream first, okay?" <nl> "Alright." <nl> "I'll be back, I just need to grab my sports gears from the girl's locker room. I'll meet you at the front entrance." <nl> Before I can say anything, she was gone. <nl> For some odd reason, I have a slight, uneasy feeling that Irina purposely interrupted me. As if the words I am about to say could potentially destroy our friendship. <nl> *Irina...* <nl> I don't know what's going on. <nl> I thought about the past. Back in middle school, I was constantly ridiculed by my peers for being a weirdo. I thought my 'manifestation' ability was ubiquitous, that everyone possesses it. After sharing it with my classmates, they initially thought I was joking. But after recognizing how zealous I was into my "roleplaying", I was immediately outcasted. <nl> "Don't talk to him, he's one of those losers that can't distinguish fantasy from reality." <nl> "Oooooh! Watch out. He will possess you and make you do bad things." <nl> "And you wonder why he doesn't have any friends." <nl> As the school year gradually progress, I was alone. <nl> But for some reason I still cannot fathom, you decided to talk to me. <nl> I still remember that fateful day. <nl> When you sat down casually next to me as I ate my lunch alone near the school rooftop. You chatted with me like I was your closest friend despite how we never met before. You showed full interest in my boring daily life. And above all, everytime lunch ends, you would present me that signature beautiful smile and say in a dulcet voice: "See you tomorrow, Jan." <nl> I am so grateful for you. <nl> You gave me meaning into my life. <nl> And that's why, whatever that emptiness feeling is. <nl> I will fill that up, Irina. <nl> *Just like you did for me.* <eos>

<sos> I was in an brightly-lit room. At the other side of the table sat a woman, staring at me with dispassionate eyes. <nl> "Where are we?" I asked her. <nl> "I don't know," she said. <nl> "Are you here to monitor me?" I asked her. <nl> "I don't know," she said without skipping a beat, "Are you?" <nl> "Could you stop staring at me? Your fishy gaze is downright disgusting." <nl> "I could," she said as she kept staring at me. <nl> She was wearing the same kind of gray generic clothes as they had given me. There was nothing else in this room, not even a door or a security camera. Most likely, she had no idea what was going on either. Probably useless. <nl> "What are we doing here?" she asked after a while. She still hadn't blinked. There was something odd about this woman. <nl> "I don't know, does it matter?" <nl> She thought about that for a while. <nl> "I guess not." <nl> Given our predicament, she seemed awfully calm. I obviously wasn't intimidated by any of this, but she didn't seem concerned about me or this weird room either. <nl> Neither of us was restrained, I could be done with her in a few seconds if I felt like it. A few seconds of pressure at the right spots and her brain would stop functioning for good. Ending a life was easy. <nl> "I can think of a dozen ways to kill you," she suddenly said. It sounded more like she stated a fact than like any kind of threat. I could not help but smile. <nl> "Me too," I replied. And I could. <nl> "But isn't it wrong to take a life?" she asked while she *finally* blinked, a few times in rapid succession. <nl> "Is it really?" I said. "What part of it, exactly? A human life doesn't mean anything. We're just biological engines meant to reproduce and die off. Anything else we do in between is inconsequential in the long run." <nl> "I agree," she said. <nl> "So doing whatever you want to do seems the most logical way to live your life. If life doesn't matter anyway you might as well do with it what you will." <nl> A thin smile had crept up at the side of her lip at that last sentence. Either this woman was my long lost twin sister, or she was just saying whatever I wanted to hear. Either way, I was done with her. Nothing to be gained from this kind of woman. <nl> She stood up. "Thanks, this has been very informative," she said, as she started to walk towards me. I tried to stand up as well but my legs wouldn't move. <nl> "You can turn yourself off now," she said. <eos>

<sos> "The eyes," he said, after he'd swallowed a deep sip of his scotch, which, she noted, he drank neat. He held the glass in his hand without putting it down. The liquid inside must be about the same simmering temperature as his own skin. "You have to pay close attention to their eyes," he continued. "They always tell you what they're thinking." <nl> "It's true," she said, swirling her glass until the orange peel in her Old Fashioned freed itself from the ice. "Fear, in those eyes, when you can see it, even when it's from far away - that's the moment when you have to take the shot, or else it's all over." <nl> "It's not always fear, though," he said, contemplatively, rather than in challenge. She shifted her weight slightly in her chair. <nl> "Sometimes they take in their environment, and then it's like that fear melts away - they decide there's nothing to be afraid of," he said. "You thought they were self-conscious of the possibility that someone would capture them, like that, but then they relax completely. A friend diverts their attention, or they take a breath and notice the fresh air around them. You've got to wait for that moment when they're distracted from themselves, unconscious of being seen." <nl> "Yes," she nodded. "It's that moment when they turn towards you, and open up a line straight to their heart - that's a powerful feeling." <nl> "Exactly," he nodded, breaking out into a broad smile. "I wouldn't have put it like that, but that's beautiful." <nl> She realized her own mistake just in time to compose her features into the expected smile he presumed he'd see. "Thanks," she said. "Yeah, when you get the perfect shot like that- it's really something." <nl> "It seemed like what I said threw you, there, for a moment, even though you described it perfectly," he said. "Don't be self-conscious about your work." <nl> "Ha," she laughed. "You know how it is. We always feel that we're amateurs." <nl> "Mind if I see some of your photos?" he inquired. "What are you shooting with, anyway?" <nl> She gave him a wry smile as she handed over her Instagram page on her phone. "It's really not much good at all," she said, apologetically. <nl> She'd only seen evidence of her real work in crime scene photos. This consisted of flesh pierced with one single bullet, cleanly-shot, so the bodies were stained with far less blood in the foreground than you'd expect, which pooled darkly below them, throwing the pale fabric of their clothing into sharp relief against the light of the flash. Their faces were always denuded of any personal affect, wrenched in the last expression of their lives, which was, inevitably, shock at their own death. She did this part of her job very well. They hadn't seen it coming at all. <nl> Her Instagram was mostly pictures of her own dog, taken with the flash on her iPhone, usually in dimly-lit interiors. She could see him struggling to find something positive to say about it. She liked that he was diplomatic. <nl> "I'm actually not a photographer," she said, on a whim. "That wasn't the kind of shooting I was talking about. Just so you know. I'm a *very* good shot. Just not of the kind you thought we were talking about, if you know what I mean." <nl> He stared at her, bemused. Then he burst into loud laughter. <nl> "You're a funny one," he said. "I like that. But there's no need to make up fanciful tales. You don't have to pretend to be an assassin if you're not happy with your skills behind the lens. We all start somewhere. These aren't half bad at all." <nl> "You're right - we do all start somewhere," she said, with a half-smile. "Well, thanks for being one of the few people in the world who understand my weird sense of humor. My last boyfriend -" she trailed off, with a sigh, hoping that this excuse would be the end of the discussion. <nl> But it wasn't. They'd talked for several hours longer - well, mostly he'd talked, and she'd tried to pay attention. He kept on pandering to her, encouraging her in her hobby, though she knew he was just being kind. <nl> "You know how it is in this business - you capture everyone's vulnerability but your own," he was saying, and she nodded. <nl> He'd hugged her and asked if she wouldn't mind going on a date sometime. She'd agreed, and then erased all the carefully-constructed backstory she'd created over the past few months on social media, completely ghosting him, along with everyone else she'd pretended to be friends with while she was stationed here. He seemed like a nice guy, and she hoped he'd soon forget her, even if he hadn't really known to take her seriously. <nl> But she hadn't forgotten him. She returned, every so often, to his favourite bar. She often did so after a particularly tough job, when she'd wanted to forget what her own work consisted of. When he was there, she'd watch him from a corner of the room. She'd disguise herself in a dark wig, or a pale one; by hunching over slightly, or wearing five-inch heels to make herself seem taller. <nl> Tonight was different. He usually ignored the corner of the bar where she sat in her various disguises, chatting with his buddies, or with some pretty girl or another  - it was never the same girl more than three nights in a row. But now, for some reason, he'd decided to wander over to her corner of the room. <nl> "Excuse me," he'd said, as her heart pounded. She really hadn't been very discreet, had she. <nl> "I don't mean to be rude," he was saying. "You're a stranger, after all. Just let me know if you'd rather drink alone, and I'll leave you be. But you look  - lonely, for lack of a better word." <nl> She swallowed, and nodded. <nl> "What're you having?" he asked. "Can I wager a guess? And old-fashioned, maybe?" <nl> "Yes," she said, her voice slightly hoarse. "Come join me, if you like. So long as you don't mind drinking with a stranger. I mean, who knows who I might be?" <nl> "Indeed," he nodded. "Who knows who you might be? I might have guessed you were a photographer, with those steady hands," he said, with a smile, looking down at the fingers which held her empty glass, which were, in fact, shaking. "But then again, I've been wrong before." <nl> She smiled at him when he returned from the bar, and they clinked their glasses together and drank. <nl> r/eros_bittersweet <eos>

<sos> My daughter Isabella rolls her clear-sky eyes when I tell her to mind the gators. The pit cost me a proper fortune--hand-dug by a pair of burly dwarves who seemed less than faithful to the notion of fair business practices towards the end--yet you'd never catch Izzy admiring. No *Gee dad! Look at those pearly whites!* No, *holy smokes, those make me feel safe at home*. No.  She and her new silk dress are just *twirl, swish, zoom* all the way up to her tower each and every time I mention her meds. <nl> "You *don't* need to remind me dad!" her squeaky voice echoes down untold flights of stairs. "I'm not a mutt on a leash!" <nl> "Are you crying?" I ask, de-activating the tripwires with muscle-memory as I climb the stone tower after her. "What did I--?" <nl> *Slam.* *Clink.* *Crick*. <nl> I've got to hand it to her. She's got the goblin-forged door locks down pat. I'd been worried about making such an investment, but she had no qualms slamming that notion right in my face. <nl> After our arguments, I typically sigh and pour handbrewed moonshine into a glass by the fireplace.  I collapse in my old rocker and drink beneath a waning lantern. The distillery is located on the ground floor of my fortress. It's the one thing I've left untouched after all these years. The barrels still have that mossy film that Paw swore gave the 'shine some aftertaste, and the bottles I use are all recycled mats from the olden days, when Izzy was just a squalling babe. As strange as it is to say, sometimes I wager *those were the days*. <nl> Those days, I could've kept adventurers away as easily as lifting a bale of hay. <nl> Those days, Izzy used to smile when I hummed her to sleep. <nl> Those days, her mother had yet to cough up handfuls of blood. <nl> Usually, after two or three glasses, I hear Izzy singing to the moon. Her songs are all laced with teardrops. I peek out discretely from the lower story windows, and each time I see why I have had such hardship. The girl looks just like her mother--the very same ashberry hair and little porcelain lips. The moon gleams off her eyes as she croons on the tower windowsill. Hell, she even has her mother's voice. It's no wonder adventurers from the four corners of the world have come to whisk her away. I'd done the same with her mother, what feels like a lifetime ago. There's some monkey knot of Fate that binds humans together like that. A pretty girl sings to the moon, and soon enough the boys stumble out of the bushes. <nl> It's no wonder why she's grown to hate me. No matter how many trinkets I buy her, or the dresses I import, she trudges the hallways asking to see the world. If she were more like *me*, perhaps I could bear to see her go. Perhaps I would stop adding to this abominable fortress and let her live her damned life, carried away but this prince charming or that *next-in-line*. But she's gotten more of her mother than either of us could bargain for. <nl> Her mother had the same affliction. And I cannot bear another bout of heartbreak. <nl> Most mornings, I bring her a platter of bacon. I unwind the spike-traps, and hop over all the false steps, bowing low before her reinforced door with our usual peace treaty. "It's nature's miracle," I say with an apologetic smile. Most mornings, too, she apologizes in return. She chews on the bacon and shows me the progress of her pill minder--the days all writ in golden letters. <nl> "Thank you," I say. "You know...your mother neglected..." <nl> "I know dad. I'm sorry," she'd say, throwing her arms around me. I knew it was all in the name of placation. She'd eat her bacon, maybe flip me off as my boots echoed down the spiral stairs, but she'd have taken her pills. She'd have remained alive, and safe, and the universe remained balanced. <nl> Yet, today, everything is off kilter. It's as if Atlas has let us roll off his back. I try using the platter to pry her door open, but my feet slip on all the blasted bacon grease. "Izzy!" I shout. "Are you alright in there?" <nl> No answer, save silence. <nl> I resort to using the acid from ground level moat. Eventually, the locks give--I suppose those goblins didn't think of everything. When I swing the door open, I fear the worst--a barrel chested prince protecting her with one arm. But Izzy is just...gone. Absent among billowing curtains. <nl> Her bedsheets are gone too. <nl> My heart flutters as I stumble to her windowsill. It's early yet--the moon is still out, caught in that strange tidepool of the in-between. Not quite morning, not quite night, just a clenched fist of confusion. <nl> Her bedsheets are tied to the support beam of the planter. <nl> My chest lurches as I see her crumpled and lifeless on the ground. <nl> Amidst roiling emotion, I turn my bleary eyes towards the moon and let *loose*. <nl> My fortress has undergone hundreds of changes. I've added boiling pots of oil to the ramparts and fashioned poison dragon spikes to the drawbridge. The moat itself has gone from water to lava to a steaming river of acid. Once, I'd even conscripted a *dragon* into patrolling the reception hall. I'd spent years protected my little girl from the outside, building her tower higher and higher away from anyone who might take her. <nl> In the end, all I'd really needed to give her were a few more blankets. <nl> -------------------------- <nl> r/M0zark <eos>

<sos> Her eyes were like two moldy apples: dull-green and rotten to the core. Her hair sat on her head in a trembling auburn bun, as if anxiously waiting for a bus to take it far away from this mess. Looking back, if it had had a spare ticket, I might have taken it. <nl> "What did you do with the dough, Miss Berkley?" <nl> It took her a long time to answer. Her face so taut in concentration, I leaned back in case it snapped. <nl> "Crumpets," she taunted eventually, in her crisp English accent. As cold as the country she came from. <nl> I leaned in, snarling. "Okay. Fine. Play games." <nl> She looked around the empty room, then shrugged. "I spy with my little--" <nl> "I get it. I get it. You're smart. But you're not *that* smart. We found your fingerprints on the knife that was used to kill the cashier." I lowered my voice, conspiratorially. "Just tell me this -- how did you know the cameras were off? You had someone on the inside?" <nl> "On the inside? Oh, I'm not pregnant, if that's what you're implying." <nl> My eyebrows crawled up my forehead, exploring the fringes of the greying jungle above. The dame was smart. Didn't fall for the fingerprints ruse, and frankly, it didn't seem like she wasn't going to incriminate herself one way or another. <nl> "How about I lay all my cards on the table?" <nl> Her face brightened. "That would certainly broaden the possibilities." <nl> I grinned. "Yeah. It would. Okay then, here we go: you were seen by multiple witnesses walking into the bank moments before it was robbed. You had a large bag in your hands. When you came out, you no longer held said bag, and instead, a man wearing a balaclava had it, who followed you out less than a minute later. An accomplice. Now, that's not enough by itself to put you away, but coupled with the train robbery, and jewellery heist -- where we've got you pinned to either scene by a half-dozen witnesses, well, now our case is about as tight as a well sealed can of beans. So, if you want to make a plea deal, this is the time to get talking. Understand?" <nl> She swallowed; her nerves were showing. "Does this mean we're not going to be playing cards, detective?" <nl> It took me a moment to realise she was messing me around. She had no intention of giving me any useful information. Unlike me, she was keeping her cards close to her chest. I shot her a look. Her dress was loose, showcasing the kind of cleavage that would have made a nudist blush. Truth was, if I'd been a packet of cards, that's where I would have hidden, too. <nl> "I don't play games," I said. <nl> "Bad loser?" <nl> "Bad winner." I ran a hand down my face and silenced a sigh. I was going to have to let her go, and I still had no idea where she'd strike next. Her crimes were almost random. No connection between them at all. No modus operandi. She was playing chess, I was playing pin the tail on the donkey. Blindfolded. <nl> "I like you, detective," she said, out of the blue. <nl> "Good to know," I replied, not allowing her taunting to get to me. <nl> She pulled a pin out of her bun; her hair bled over her face, as if it had been hit by the bus, instead of boarding it. "You know, they always called me dumb at school. Said I'd never make anything of my life. But you -- *you* believe in me." <nl> I snorted. "They were only half right, I'd say." <nl> "Yes. I suppose they were." <nl> There was a knock on the door. <nl> "Looks like our time's up," I said. <nl> She glanced about the room. "I don't even see a clock." <nl> I laughed. I had to give it to her -- she knew how to stay in character. I'd seen worse actors on Broadway. Truth be told, I was beginning to have my own doubts about her -- just like the rest of the department.  Doubts that were creeping into my mind as quietly as mice in slippers, but there nonetheless, padding away step by step. Maybe they were right. Maybe I just kept bringing her back in because she was easy on the eyes.  The kind of mugshot you'd base a case around just to see it everyday up there on the wall. <nl> Or maybe it was 'cause paperwork doesn't make good company at night, even if it means you get most of the bed to yourself. <nl> "You're free to leave," I said, rising from my chair. <nl> She walked to the door, then turned. "I'll see you again soon, Inspector." She smiled, her lips curling in a she-devil grin. That smile was like a cat chasing the mice back into their holes. <nl> She was as guilty as sin, and I'd be taking her to church for bread and penance. <nl> "As I've got to make a report on my missing bag," she continued. "It was stolen whilst I was in the bank. I only put it down for a second! But, people today." She shook her head mournfully. "Can't trust anyone." <nl> I let out a long breath. "Good day, Miss Berkley." <nl> "Good day, Inspector." <nl> --- <nl> more of my stories on /r/nickofnight <eos>

<sos> Today is our second date. And our last. <nl> I'd hate to end it with Alice, but she's not worth dying for. None of them are. <nl> I roll up to her house in my 1970 Dodge Charger. She runs out of her front door, her heels in hand - rather than her feet\-  Her dress, blacker than my car, looked quite beautiful on her. I'm not going to lie, she is one of my favorites. <nl> In the looks department, It certainly helps that she stops aging in her teen years, like the rest of us. It allows us to grow old with their soulmate. It is quite an appealing quality. <nl> I am going to miss her. <nl> Alice opens the door and she squeals, <nl> "John! How in the hell did you get a car like this? It's so old, it has to be expensive!" <nl> "My dad is rich." I lied. <nl> It's best that she didn't know that a few centuries of life have allowed me to live in eternal luxury. <nl> "Well, perhaps I'll have to give you a rich time after the movie." She put her hand on my thigh. <nl> "I can't wait, hun." I hold her hand. It'll be the last time. <nl> I burn out of her street. I might as well give her a good thrill before the night is over. <nl> As we got to the mall, I ask her, "Hey, want to get some In N Out before we go in?" <nl> "Sounds good to me, babe". <nl> Good thing I wore my leather jacket. It makes adding Cyanide far easier. It helps that they come in packets identical to In N Out salt packets nowadays. <nl> We get our food in the drive thru, and I take her order of fries and switch her salt packet with the cyanide packet, with my perfected slight of hand. <nl> I give her the order of fries. <nl> Alice turns to me and says "You want to know something?" <nl> "What is that?" I ask her. <nl> "You're so insanely attractive." She pulls me by the collar of my jacket and we touch lips. Damn, do I like this girl. <nl> I close my eyes, and passionately kiss her. I might as well enjoy this surprise. <nl> A minute later, she pulls away and she says "Lets eat, hun. We're going to be late." <nl> We crack open our packets and put it in our separate orders of fries. <nl> I eat a few. Something is very wrong. It doesn't taste right. <nl> "Alice, does your fries taste weird?" <nl> "No. Why, does yours?" <nl> "Yeah." <nl> Then it hit me. I can't breathe, and I feel weak. <nl> "I...can't...breathe...help" I say, in between my short breaths. <nl> "You see, I can't do that. Like you, I plan on living forever." She says, in an eerily soft voice. "I've been around a few centuries, and your sham is the oldest trick in the book. I'll see you in the next life." <nl> Well played Alice. Well played. <eos>

<sos> RUN! LEAVE NOW AND DON'T LOOK BACK! That's what the slip from her fortune cookie said. Anne sat there staring at it for a second, then raised her head and looked around the busy restaurant. She didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Just tables full of office workers in their business casual clothes, absorbed in their phones, trying to distract themselves on their lunch breaks. She hadn't noticed when the bill had been laid at her table with the individually wrapped treat on it, but something in her gut told her she should heed the cookie's warning and go. She picked up her cell phone, threw some money on the table, and immediately walked out of the restaurant. <nl> She didn't run, but she was walking away quickly. She was more than two blocks away and had just rounded the corner of a sturdy brick building when she was knocked over by the force of the explosion. <nl> The Jade Dragon was a small Chinese restaurant a little over six blocks from her office. It was owned and operated by an immigrant family who were very polite and were the only employees. It had good Lo Mein and great Crab Rangoon, but now it was a smoldering hole in the side of a building on Eastern Avenue. <nl> Anne got up from the ground and looked back around the corner. She could see the smoke and flames billowing from the ruined facade of the building and could hear the car alarms blaring for blocks around. She started to slowly walk back to the scene of carnage when some graffiti caught her eye. Written in bright neon green paint on the back of a no parking sign were the words "YOU'RE LOOKING BACK!" with a frowny face below it. Stunned, she stared at it for a moment, then again looked around. The streets were beginning to fill will people from the surrounding offices and storefronts. As the crowd grew, she turned and started running. <eos>

<sos> *The scene is a room with a single desk. A weary looking woman chews on gum while looking through her phone. A 7 foot demon sits on the chair across from her with a collar around its neck, its wicked sharp horns scraping against the ceiling. Outside a single window a scene of desolation can be seen. Plumes of fire, rivers of lava and all that. Occasional screams can be heard in the room. The woman ignores them, but each scream makes the demon flinch.* <nl> Woman: (Looking up from her phone) "Name?" <nl> Demon: "Ashmodeon seventh spawn of the great seer Glarastell, heir to the mig-" <nl> Woman: "Alright, Ash it is. Now Ash what did you do in hell?" <nl> Ashmodeon: (Snarling) "Insolent human, how dare you mock my name as such! You will-" <nl> *The woman sighs and taps a button under the table. The Demon writhes in pain as the collar around its neck glows a bright blue.* <nl> Woman: (Looking at her phone again) "Like, seriously. I have a quota to fill, so why don't you just answer my questions and we can both be done with this. Sounds reasonable yeah?" <nl> Ash: (Smoke coming out of its nostrils) "So be it." <nl> Woman: "Alright, so what did you do in hell?" <nl> Ash: "Very funny human, surely you know I am a dread lord, I led mighty forces against your pathetic." <nl> Woman: (Almost to herself) "Military, got it." <nl> Woman: (Looks up from her phone to glare at the demon who had opened his mouth to say something then thought better better of it): "How many humans do you think you have tortured?" <nl> Ash: "Billions, easily. I have made the vilest humans cry and beg." <nl> Woman: (Blow a bubble which pops in Ash's face) "Billions, got it. Final question, have you ever been to heaven?" <nl> Ash: (Frowning) "Of course not, why-" <nl> Woman: (Sighing as she scrolls through Hellit(tm) for the millionth time) "So to summarize, you led forces against us, tortured us, and know absolutely nothing about heaven - making you useless to us, correct?" <nl> Ash: (Cocking its head) "Seems correct." <nl> *The woman presses another button and the demon, along with the chair falls through a hole under it. She rubs her ears from the echoing screams of the demon as it fell into the void.* <nl> Woman: "Next!" <nl> *** <nl> (minor edits) <nl> First time doing a screenplay like this, feedback is appreciated. <nl> If you enjoyed, check out my sub, [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/) <eos>

<sos> They say people lose a third of their lifetime to sleep. I live an entire lifetime in less than a day. <nl> "Doc, what should I do?" <nl> I paced around the room as I waited for an answer. <nl> Doctor Cain adjusted his glasses slowly before fixing me with a contemplative stare. "I'm sorry but before I can answer any of your questions Jenny... That is the name of the body you are in right now, correct?" <nl> I nodded. This time I was a woman barely into my twenties and already my body wore more piercings and tattoos then all my previous lives combined. <nl> Doctor Cain paused for a moment before asking the question I knew was coming. <nl> "What was your name yester-" <nl> "Rick. Rick Crawver," I said sharply. <nl> "And the day before?" <nl> "Tamara Turner." <nl> "And before that?" <nl> "Bobby Santiago, Owen Arhshad, Shinji Naka-" <nl> "Alright, alright, that's enough," he waves his hand, before adjusting his glasses again. "Now tell me Jenny... How much time does she have left?" <nl> Jenny? Right. That's my name now. I swallowed as I tried to remember the exact time that I 'woke up' today. "An hour? No. It's probably closer to half-an-hour," I said, still pacing around the room. <nl> Doctor Cain adjusts his glasses again, this time his hand is shaking. "This is... not a lot of time to work with. What took you so long to come here?" <nl> I stopped pacing. "Do you really wanna know? Its a long story, and a terrible one at that. And did you see the car I came here in? It fucking stinks of drugs. It's probably stolen too, damn it. And when I woke up, I was surrounded by druggies and I think they're onto me. I didn't know their names and apparently they had something big going on today. I just bailed on them and-" I paused. "-Sorry for the ranting." <nl> Doctor Cain took a deep breath. "Jenny, this better not be like the last time when-" <nl> Suddenly the door to the warehouse breaks open. This was the place where Doctor Cain and I had designated our safe-house. <nl> "How?" I muttered as I glanced at Doctor Cain. <nl> Doctor Cain shook his head quickly. <nl> A gang of thugs struts in, guns in hand. One of them walks forward, separating from the rest as he approaches me. "Jen, babe! How could you leave me? And you took all the good shit with you and who the fuck is this old guy?" he shouts. <nl> My mind blanked for a moment. I knew no name or story and Jenny was a mystery to me. <nl> "Uh... hey!" I wave cheerfully. "I was just about to leave! Don't worry about him, he's no buddy impor-" <nl> "Who the fuck is this guy!" he screams manically, then whips his arm up, pistol trained on Doctor Cain. <nl> "Don't!" I scream. <nl> He fires. <nl> I jump. <nl> ------ <nl> "Honey, are you awake?" a voice whispers softly, barely audible and yet it was clear - almost as if it was next to my ear. <nl> A soft sensation tugs at my chest. My eyes snap open and immediately I see a woman in bed next to me, half naked and arm resting on my chest. <nl> Another face I didn't know. <nl> "Honey? What's wrong?" she asks. <nl> "Nothing uhh - honey," I say quickly. <nl> Another face who I couldn't put a name to. <nl> I slid out of bed slowly, hoping she didn't notice. But she does. <nl> "Nathan? What's going on? Talk to me." <nl> For a moment I wonder if I should just leave. But I don't because I knew it wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't be fair to Nathan and to *her.* <nl> "Listen, I'm not Nathan," I said as I stare into the mirror on the wall. "I'm-" <nl> Who am I? I had forgotten lifetimes ago. Here I had short dark hair, light skin and pale green eyes. <nl> She laughs softly. "And I"m not Sophie. Did you have too much to drink last-" she pauses, "Honey why are you crying?" <nl> I turned away from the mirror. "Because I'm going to die today." <nl> -------- <nl> --------- <nl> /r/em_pathy <eos>

<sos> After three weeks, she finally dropped the pretense. <nl> The new 'nurse' had started just three weeks ago. During that time, my condition has still slowly worsened - the daily march of the cancer would not stop, and the weakness progressed and the pain intensified - but she kept trying. <nl> It was the damn water cup. She would very carefully slip a few drops from a vial into it. Not much, but depending on what it was, probably enough. Her care, however, didn't extend to preventing me from seeing. She was just barely making sure I saw the vial, the cup, and her eyes. <nl> Her eyes were normal, except in that moment. In that moment, they were like orbs of pale blue light. It was only a moment, but she wanted me to see. I could never figure out why. <nl> I made an excuse about not being thirsty, and later accidentally knocked the cup over. She sighed, wiped it up, and grabbed another... with no addition from the vial. <nl> For three weeks, we went through variations of this game. <nl> I thought about reporting her. But while I knew every other nurse and assistant by name, I didn't know hers. I wasn't even sure I could describe her. She had hair, skin and eyes, but I could never bring to mind what color they were. More importantly, she never felt threatening, even when I caught her. She just seemed... tired. <nl> Then, she decided to come clean with me. <nl> She shut the door. This was not uncommon, but she moved.... differently. Not trying to hide what she was doing from people. I didn't feel afraid - after all, what could she do to me that the cancer wasn't? She walked over to the bed tray, and placed the vial on it. <nl> "I've been trying to be subtle - it helps make people feel less guilty - but I think I need to be clear and direct with you. Is that OK?" <nl> I nodded. <nl> She closed her eyes. When she finally opened them again, the pale blue orbs of light were back. "I think you know what I am. You may try to avoid thinking about it, but now is the time to." <nl> "I have my suspicions, but it's kinda hard to articulate..." <nl> The caregiver sighed, and it was such a heavy sigh it almost hurt. "I'm an angel. Specifically, an angel of death. I'm here because you are dying. You know that, I know that, your doctors know that, your family knows that. It's inescapable." <nl> "Then why not just take me?" <nl> "That's not quite how it works, I'm afraid. You will die, and I will take you then. I can't force that to happen. I can, however, give you the choice. I decide whether or not you get the choice." <nl> "What choice?" <nl> "The choice of going sooner. It's not suicide - it's admitting that you are dying, and moving on to the afterlife without fighting, without hurting, without extending the misery. It's an act of mercy that makes the pain stop. That's why I made sure you saw." <nl> "So... why are you telling me this?" <nl> "Cancer is... an aberration. It's the body deviating from God's plan. It doesn't happen because He willed it. It happens because the world seeps into you over time, and He can only protect you so much here. It's your body exercising free will, even when your mind and soul would not. The choice isn't just for those losing a battle with cancer, but many falling this way deserve the choice." <nl> "OK... but why are you telling me this now?" <nl> She chuckled. Her eyes shone, just a bit brighter. "Well, for three weeks, I've offered you the choice, and you've declined. I was prepared to offer it again today, but..." She paused as she picked up the vial, brought it close to my ear, and shook it. "It's empty." <nl> "What does that mean?" <nl> "It means that I can't pour them from the vial, so you would have seen me do this." She picked up the foam water cup - which she had already filled without fanfare earlier - and held it under her face. Then, she quietly cried, and faintly glowing tear drops fell into the cup. "It means nothing more than I would have needed to replenish the vial, and I felt it a good opportunity to explain the situation." <nl> "Will it hurt?" <nl> "No. Much less than what is to come otherwise. It's just like drifting to sleep." <nl> "What about my family?" <nl> "They will have to deal with this heartache anyway. This allows them to do it without having seen you at your very lowest." <nl> I couldn't say anything. I had no more questions. <nl> She got up from the side of the bed. "I don't blame you if you don't take up the offer. It's a hard decision. I'll still offer as things progress." <nl> "It's OK." <nl> I took a drink. She smiled, held my hand, and we left together. <eos>

<sos> "Father *please.* We must leave," pleaded Euna. <nl> The chief of the village shook his head slowly as he gazed at his people. "For centuries this has been our home, Euna. But did you know Euna, before this, we had nothing. You do not know because you weren't born yet. Our ancestors fought with their lives to make this forest a home for us. If we leave now, and abandon what we have, then we will be throwing away all that our ancestors have done for us." <nl> Euna turned her gaze to the horizon. Far above the lush green forest, looming over the horizon like a storm, was a fleet of ships. <nl> "But father! If we don't leave, what will we do? We'll be slaughtered!" Euna cried as she tugged at her father's arm. <nl> For a moment, the village chief displayed sadness and pain in his expression as he watched his daughter. But then he turned his gaze to his people, and saw. Unwavering courage and determination glistened in their eyes like fire. They would not yield. They would fight. Even to the death. <nl> The chief spoke, a steadfast voice that carried its way to the crowd that had gathered. "Even if we run now, sooner or later they will come for us. I will stay and fight. Those who will standby me... step forward." <nl> And with those words, everyone stepped forward. <nl> Euna watched in silence as her people began to roar, a warcry that would be heard by the fleet of Augmented. She had heard the stories. The Augmented lived in colossal mechanical cities. Spires of machinery and technology that vastly outpaced the rest. They were, by far, the largest race to emerge from Humanity. Vastly outnumbering the rest. Then came the Altered, who were the epitome of genetic phenomenon. For a time, the Altered were superior. A single Altered was capable of taking on a troop of Augmented. But the Augmented learned, and grew *mechanically*. Devising weapons and defenses that became more devastating and effectual with each fight against the Altered. Then there was the Ascended, but most say they were merely fables. That none really existed. But some say that the Ascended were *everywhere*, that they were a collective of many that existed as a singular, all-encompassing entity. That they were virtually, a god. <nl> For all of her life, these stories were - just that, stories. But now she saw. Beyond the verdant glade that their village had nested peacefully for centuries was now a force of machinery that would eliminate their village with more efficiency than any force of nature. <nl> She didn't understand. What could a village of Altered hidden in the forest for centuries do? <nl> Then she saw. <nl> Her fellow villagers that she had known all her life as simply beautiful and graceful in appearance, suddenly changed into beings of hulking absurdities. Malformed wings of scale and feathers sprouted, as limbs grew into trees. Their eyes shifted, and suddenly they were eyes of crimson and pupils like slits. They were taller than the trees now, but one of them towered above the rest. <nl> It was her father. <nl> A golden mane rested on his shoulders. His lips of stone yawned open to reveal teeth like diamonds. He spoke, an unearthly and unfamiliar voice. "Take flight my angels." <nl> And with that, they flew. They flew into the horizon where they would meet death. <nl> Euna cried as she watched the first Altered fall out of the sky. Wings singed and head incinerated into nothing. The village, her family, they were all going to die. Her heart hurt, and she let anger erase the pain. She let herself *change.* Euna would fight. And she knew that she would probably die the same way. <nl> But a voice spoke. A voice that was many but at the same time, it was one. <nl> '*A Way*' it whispered into her mind. <nl> Her vision distorted. Suddenly, she could see beyond the horizons. She could feel her mind dip into a well of memories. And suddenly, she knew what she had to do. <nl> Euna took flight. <nl> -------- <nl> -------- <nl> Gotta go to work! if I do write a part two it would probably be tomorrow... <nl> /r/em_pathy <nl> Edit* part 2 done, click the link below! <nl> [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Em_pathy/comments/8vimt3/the_altered_the_augmented_and_the_ascended/) <eos>

<sos> You look out your window and you see a woman. She is walking around the street outside your home hitting cars with a rake. <nl> Look again. <nl> You look out your window and you see a woman. She is terrified, carrying the only weapon she was able to find before racing out of her home. She beats at her surroundings fruitlessly to stave off an unseen evil. <nl> Look again. <nl> You look out your window and you see a woman. She is in the throes of a rage. The bank has foreclosed on her car, she has been fired from her job and her husband has been cheating on her. She has no friends and no one to talk to. She needs to vent if she is to remain sane. A rake and some cars strike her as a small price to pay. <nl> Look once more. <nl> You look out your window and you see a woman. She smoked methamphetamine once, on a dare, the day she graduated high school. Now her skin is all welts and sores. Her teeth waggle in her sloppy gums. She has run out of feeling good. *Perhaps* she thinks *there's some cash in these cars*. She picks up a rake and goes to work. <nl> A window is a quantum threshold, a quantum vantage point through which we observe the world - a double slit experiment of domestic proportions. <nl> Standing behind your curtains, you hear a ruckus outside. Metal on metal. You wonder what could possibly be going on. You decide to look. In looking you become observer and, in observing, you change that which you observe. <nl> Like Schrodinger's cat, the woman outside your window was not defined until you observed her in her madness/desperation/terror/rage. The woman was all these things, all at once, and none of these things. She was only a cloud of probability slamming a rake into cars. <nl> But by observing her, the probability field that is the woman collapses in on itself and picks a reality. <nl> You think, *but she was out there already, she exists herself, before I witnessed her* <nl> Was she? Look again. <nl> You look out your window and see a rake floating through the air. It slams itself into nearby cars of its own accord, with no outside influence whatsoever. <nl> We believe the world is as it is because we are creatures of habit and children of pattern.  We assume, because we have seen reality behave a certain way many times before, that reality *is* a certain way, follows certain rules, by default. <nl> We hew to this delusion because the alternative is too frightening, too destabilizing, to consider: that we are, each of us, alone in a vacuum tube, linked together only by shared interpretations of the chance reflections of photons on objects we will never truly see, the faint pressure of atoms from sounds we can never truly hear. <nl> It is this amalgam of our cumulative observations which defines our shared reality, as well as each other. In that sense, the woman exists *because* you looked. Her motivations, her entire being, are defined by your seeing her. <nl> There is a sound of metal on metal outside your window. You decide *not* to look. There is no woman. <nl> What I mean to say, if I mean to say anything, is that, whatever the woman's explanation for why she acts the way she does, in a very real sense she owes you a debt of gratitude, for to be seen is to exist and, without an observer, we are nothing. <nl> ***** <nl> ***** <nl> ## r/LFTM <nl> Welp that was a weird thought experiment that never coalesced into anything really :) <eos>

<sos> "Where am I?" she asked, rubbing her head, sitting up from the mattress. <nl> "My basement," the man replied without looking up from the papers he sorted. <nl> "How did I get here?" <nl> He glanced at her briefly before deciding she would figure it out. <nl> "Did you... My drink! What the f..." <nl> Looks like she figured it out. <nl> She stood up and stumbled toward the door, trying the handle. "It's locked." She struggled back over to the mattress and sat on it again. She looked at her hands. "I'm... I'm very calm." <nl> The man nodded. "The drugs will do that. You'll feel pretty calm for... I'm guessing another half an hour." He checked his watch. "It seems like your memory is starting to work like normal again though, so maybe we can finally get started." <nl> "What do you mean? About my memory." <nl> "Certain drugs inhibit memory function. You probably feel like you just woke up, but that's not quite true. We've been talking for about an hour now. It's just that you're only starting to remember." <nl> "The bar... I met you... My drink...!" <nl> "Yep." <nl> A new thought occurred to her. "Did you-!?" <nl> "-no," he said simply, squaring up a set of papers. <nl> "Oh," she said, suddenly satisfied, unable to feel too angry. She should feel angry. She should be scared! She should... but she somehow could not. She looked at her hands again. "What's going on?" <nl> The man checked his watch. Satisfied with the organization of his papers, he walked over to the mattress on the floor and knelt in front of her. "In about half an hour the drugs will fade. Then you'll get most of your strength back. Your emotions will return to normal. Then you're really going to be mad at me." <nl> "Why would I be mad at you?" she asked. <nl> "For kidnapping you." <nl> "Oh. Right. I can't believe I'm not mad at you right now." <nl> "Don't worry. You will be. But by then you'll be back at home. Now there are some things that I need to tell you. It will take me a few minutes to tell you these things. While I am speaking, you will nod if you understand and you will shake your head if you do not understand. If you stay quiet for the entire explanation, this will go quickly and I will take you home. Do you understand?" <nl> She nodded. <nl> "Do you know what an assassin is? Or a hitman?" <nl> She nodded. <nl> "I am a hitman. I was paid to kill you." <nl> Taking a sudden breath, she shook her head, slowly at first, but then faster. <nl> "No, no. Only shake your head if you do not understand. Otherwise, just nod and stay quiet. Do you accept that I am a hitman?" <nl> Frowning, she nodded slowly. <nl> "Do you understand that I was paid to kill you?" <nl> She looked past the man, looking to the door. Something inside her told her that she should try running again, or fighting! But then she looked at her hands. She was too calm. Too tired. She wouldn't make it. She blinked hard. Was it the drugs making her so tired? So lazy? Maybe, even if she couldn't run, she could... If she had a weapon she could... It was so hard to hold on to her thoughts... Her eyes scanned, looking for things that she could use... A chair, the desk, her purse on the floor... Her eyes widened! Her purse! Her knife! Knife inside. Now... when... He's so close right now... <nl> With a sigh the man reached forward and took the girl's hands. With a quick motion he produced her pocket knife, flicked it open, and placed the handle against her palm. <nl> "My knife... you had it...?" <nl> "Of course I had it. You'd think I'd kidnap you without peeking into your purse?" <nl> She gasped. "You looked into my purse! So you saw my-" She shook her head, trying to stay focused on the matter in front of her. Her head was clearing, but only slowly. She looked down at her hands. She looked at the knife she held in her palm. She looked at the man holding her wrists. "Why did you give me the knife? Why are you..." <nl> "I need you to stay quiet. I will explain. When I am done, I will take you home, as I said. And if you would like, when I am finished, you can try to stab me. But I would like you to wait until I have finished. Do you accept? Nod if you accept." <nl> "You'll really take me home?" <nl> He nodded. <nl> She felt his firm grip controlling her hands. She squeezed the knife as tightly as she could. Then she looked up at him and decided that all she could do right now was nod. <nl> "Young lady, I am a very bad person. I have killed many people. I am paid to do it. I was paid to kill you. But I am not going to. You have done nothing wrong. You are a good person. Do you understand?" <nl> She had questions, but she thought better of asking right now. She squeezed the knife again, feeling her grip coming back to her. She would let him talk for as long as he could... and then... she would do what she had to. She blinked hard and nodded to the man. <nl> "But I had to bring you here so that I could let you know something. I had to let you now about something that I was going to do. You see, the people that paid me, the people that want you dead - they are bad people. Maybe worse than I am. They have done very bad things. They deserve to die instead of you. Do you understand? Nod if you understand." <nl> She stared. Then she slowly nodded. <nl> "In a moment I am going to let you go. But before I do, I will allow you to ask three questions. Then I will walk you home, unless you stab me. I will not fight back. Now, if you are confused, ask your questions." <nl> "Why only three questions?" she blurted. <nl> "Because I don't want you asking four. Now be smart. Two left. I know the drugs should be wearing off, so you can probably ask something that will actually be of use to you." <nl> She thought carefully. She noticed that her pulse had begun to increase. Was she starting to feel afraid? She somehow only the very slightest tinge of anxiety somewhere at the edge of her mind. She hoped it stayed away for just a while longer... she could use some more calm now that she was thinking more clearly. Then she had her question. "You said you had to tell me something. You had to tell me about all this. But if you had already figured out what you were going to do, then it shouldn't matter whether you told me anything. If you really weren't going to kill me, then why tell me anything in the first place?" <nl> "Good," the man nodded. <nl> Somehow, she felt proud to receive the man's approval. But then she felt disgusted at the same time. She squeezed her knife, her grip getting stronger with each passing second. <nl> "I had to tell you all this because I want you to decide how this ends. You see, I do not want to kill you, and so I will kill the people that paid me. But this situation is different, and so I will give you a choice. If you disapprove of my actions, if you disapprove of my intent to kill these people, the people that will again attempt to kill you, then you can stop me - after all, you have the perfect tool in your hands already. After I let you go, you can kill me and unlock the door with the keys on the desk." <nl> Her eyes flitted to the desk and for the first time, amongst the papers, she noticed the set of keys. <nl> "But if you let me live," he continued, "I will murder two people. You will decide." <nl> She began to piece this odd scenario together in her mind. She felt like she should believe the man. He would tell her the truth, after all, would he not? Would he really kill two more people? What about after that? Would he keep living as a hitman, killing people every day? She gripped the knife, getting the full feeling of her fingers back. Did she have it in her to stop a killer? <nl> His grip on her hands stayed firm. "You get one more question." <nl> "Say I believe you. Say I believe all this. Say I just... believe that you're not just some rapist. Which is completely..." She shut her eyes, trying to figure this all out. "Who would even want to kill me in the first place? You still haven't explained why you would let me..." <nl> "... I was hired by your mother and father." <nl> Her eyes locked on to his. She stared. Was this real? When the man stood up, she looked down, confused - she hadn't even realized when he'd released her wrists. <nl> The man walked over to the table and picked up the keys. He tossed them across the room onto the mattress beside her. Then he sat in the chair next to the desk. "The red one unlocks the door. But I am serious." <nl> She picked up the keys with her left hand. Then she looked to the knife with her right. <nl> "You have a choice to make," he said quietly. <eos>

<sos> "Doloris! That bastard pervert is on TV again" Al shouted from his armchair through a mouth full of prestils. Doloris, avoiding the saliva saturated projectiles, turned to Al " I'm sitting right next to you Allan you dont have to shout" she said quietly. There was a time when Doloris would have cursed him into next Tuesday with a flick of her wrist for the meer indication that he would mutter a word with his mouth full. However things had changed Al was old and deaf and seemed to be deteriorating by the day. "This smut shouldn't be allowed before the 9pm watershed, does this man not realise the havock that would be unleashed if Hex education was a part of high school curriculum?" Al posed this as a question but Doloris knew he could neither hear her or cared about her opinion. Doloris rose gingerly from her spot on the sofa and made her way to the kitchen to fix herself a coffee. Al was shouting at the TV again, this would continue all day until he had his evening drink(spiked with just a touch nightshade to help the old sod sleep). <nl> Doloris thought about her time in highschool often these days. She wondered if anything could have been differnt if they had the kind of Hex education so prevalent in the media. In her day you learned by word of mouth. Is your husband drinking too much? You can use the alcofeto curse to put an end to that. Speaks with his mouth full? A simple incantation of cronos accelerom and he will speed through the meal none the wiser. <nl> She had heard roumors of people having adverse reactions to the curses but as Al told her time and time again this was hippy propaganda. <nl> But when she looked at him, really looked at her once strong and fierce lover he seemed 20 years older than her. This was odd, she thought. They had met at 17, married at 20. Why had he aged so terribly? Why was she still in control of her facilities and he was losing his grasp by the day? <nl> Doloris never liked such negative thoughts. Her mother had always told her "If your thoughts are troubling you cast the Hex of never blue" so she did. She sat back down next to Al, held his hand and said "Your right Allan, we never had Hex education and it's done us no harm". <eos>

<sos> Wishes are not as glamorous as they seem. To be honest, most wishes end up turning bad for the person who made them in the first place. No matter, my business has been successful - The business of now being a sort of *Wish Lawyer.* <nl> I know it is not the most creative title, but it gets the message across, and it is far better than the title I used to go by. <nl> It is a miracle that I arrived in time. The moment I stormed through the door, I found young Lily Windogul staring up in awe toward a Genie. The Genie greeted her with open arms floating over the dining room table. He was trailed by a tail of purple smoke leading down onto a bronze jar from where he had awoke. <nl> "Oh my! Oh my! It's my lucky day!" She jumped in excitement. <nl> "No it's not." I slammed my briefcase onto the table. <nl> "Who are you?" Lily quickly turned her attention onto me. <nl> "Yea!" The Genie crossed his arms, "Who are you?!" <nl> "My name is Edward and I'm here to stop that thing from doing any harm to you." <nl> The Genie floated closer to me, scrunching his brow in anger. I did not care if he was inconvenienced by my arrival. I wanted to prove to Lily that she could trust me. It didn't matter if it were a crossroads demon, a fairy, or even a dragon at this point - I wanted to show her how she was about to be swindled by this Genie creature. <nl> "*Harm?* It's a genie!" Lily's eyes lit up. "They're supposed to be a good!" <nl> "Yea, I'm the good guy!" The Genie nodded. <nl> "No *you* aren't!" I pointed back. "You guys never are!" I swear, it's like Lily never read about these things. <nl> "Look, that genie came out of the jar that I own! That means he's my genie and I deserve a wish!" Lily had let her excitement cloud her judgement. That jar had sat on the shelf for so long. The one day she knocked it down by accident, I knew it was time for me to act. <nl> I have seen that look before. It is the same look everyone gets when they find themselves in possession of a wish. I don't know why, but most people always jump to the first thing that comes to mind. <nl> "I want to be immortal! I want to live forever!" Lily shouted. <nl> "You have to say the *magic* words. You have to say it a certain way - the right words in order!" The Genie hovered over her. He placed his hands atop her shoulders. <nl> "Yea, a *certain* way. Lily, do not wish for that." <nl> "Why not?" She grew as impatient as the Genie. <nl> I snapped my fingers. In an instant, a scroll of parchment paper flew from the Genie's red sash around his waist. I put my reading glasses on in order to point Lily's attention to the text covering the Genie's record. <nl> "You see that there?" <nl> "Where?" Lily pressed her nose against the paper. She struggled reading the small print. <nl> "Right there!" I punched my forefinger down onto a particular sentence. <nl> "Wait! How did you do that?" The Genie tried pulling the scroll back, but there was too much paper circling around us. <nl> "You see? This is why you need me - a *wish lawyer*" I assured Lily. The Genie wanted to grant her wish more than anything. All Genies try hard to persuade immortality, it being the big sale. When one gets handed to them on a silver platter, they do everything to rush the process along - and quickly. Only problem is, no wish can ever be granted unless one says,'I wish," before their demand.  This Genie here had planned to make her immortal by letting her take his place within the jar. Yes, that's correct. He was going to turn her into a Genie, allowing him to go free. These things are always the same no matter where the case is. <nl> "Oh my god! You were going to trap me in that thing forever?!" Lily glared her eyes onto the Genie. <nl> "I wasn't going to trap you in my jar! I swear!" The Genie tried everything to persuade her. Lily stepped backward beside me. <nl> "How did you know?" Lily asked me. She grabbed hold of my hand after the Genie grew frustrated. <nl> "I *always* know." I replied. <nl> "I wish we could get rid of him!" she shook her head nervously. <nl> I snapped my fingers and the Genie was gone - along with the jar that housed him. Lily threw herself beside the table making sure he had truly gone. <nl> "How - How did you do that?" <nl> "It's my job." I smiled. I watched her open up the pantry door, scanning every nook and cranny to feel safe. The truth is, she still had two more wishes left. That's right, it was I who granted her first wish. Her trust in me has gone accordingly to plan. I need to play the part if I am ever going to get out of this place once and for all. <nl> &nbsp; <nl> To read more of my stories, visit [13thOlympian](https://www.reddit.com/r/13thOlympian) <eos>

<sos> "Is it Magga Glen sad?" <nl> Such were the words that became common before the Great Revolution. It was at Magga Glen where the Welsh were entrusted with the Lektor, the key to advanced science using Dark Matter. It began with takeovers in the scientific world, followed by political blackmail. Soon Alwyn Afon, the New Queen of the Lektor Welsh, had the world in the palm of her hand, through the development of powerful weapons far beyond the capabilities of any other. Thus began the first reign of a Welsh Earth. <nl> Cities were split, and renamed. Even today you will find hundreds of cities known as Cardiff, remnants of the time. Councils were subjugated, and turned. Even against her own people Alwyn was cruel, and she began a campaign of mass human experimentation. Her case was a near perfect example of the phrase, <nl> "Absolute power corrupts absolutely." <nl> She had no council, no checks and balances. There no longer was a coalition, nor alliances. Only the House of Magga Glen, the Arms of Magga Glen, the Eve of Magga Glen. <nl> In a unique twist of fate it was her own faction that turned against her first, deciding the best course was to share the Lektor at last. But first was the world rallied. Gone was the Eve of Magga Glen, gone was the blind faith the faction of Alwyn had in their queen. She had turned tyrant, and a Great Revolution was needed. <nl> "Y chwyldro newydd!" <nl> This was the phrase that united people against the tyrannical Alwyn. Her courtesans and artisans, her businessmen and advisors, all turned against her. Then, as she slept, always at her side a loyal Welsh guard as a result of her paranoia against outsiders, she was killed. <nl> The world had been freed from the tyranny of Alwyn. <nl> Now was the Age of the Lektor. <eos>

<sos> "I don't know. It just doesn't seem right somehow." Richard's voice quavered with uncertainty. <nl> Lilith rolled her eyes. "Look. It's fine. I'm saying it's fine. Let's just go over, and say hi." <nl> Her voice echoed off the cave's walls. It seemed so empty, now that the fires of Hell had gone out. She wasn't quite sure what had done it but had to admit it was a nice change of pace. There were smells entering her nostrils different from the usual brimstone and sulfur. Her eyes were quickly adjusting to the darkness, and without the constant roar of the fire, she could hear voices from nearby. It had been nearly six hundred years since she had had a conversation with someone other than the pathetic excuse for a damned human before her. She was tired and ready to go out, even if it was just to investigate. <nl> Richard wasn't convinced though. "What if it's a trap?" <nl> Lilith laughed. "What could possibly be worse than what you've already been through? I pulled out all the stops for you, buddy. The drawn and quartering. The flaying. The demon babies eating your intestines. What more could you possibly fear?" <nl> She could hear him shrugging in the darkness. "I don't know. I just do. I'd rather the devil I know, you know?" <nl> "Well, the devil you know is bored and curious," Lilith said. "I'm checking out those voices and I can't leave you alone. You're coming with me one way or another." <nl> She snapped her fingers and knew that he was now bound and gagged with invisible ropes and was floating behind her. Feeling a bit uncertain, she stepped out of her cave, psionically-dragging Richard behind her. <nl> They emerged in a large rock antechamber. Other demons and humans were also beginning to emerge from their caves. <nl> "What's going on?" Lilith asked the first demon she came upon. <nl> He beamed a smile that showed off his four layers of teeth. "Lucy fixed up the air conditioning!" <nl> "What?" <nl> In the low light, Lilith could see that a small crowd had formed around them, looking for answers. The demon looked flattered to be the center of so much attention. And why shouldn't he have been? The demons had been as trapped in those caves as the damned humans. He deserved a bit of attention. They all did. <nl> The demon affected the manner of a serious messenger. "Since we were cast out, demons have been persecuted through the fire. The dictators upstairs did not want us to leave and left us trapped in fire. But Prince Lucifer, our mighty and clever ruler with the assistance of several damned engineers, has adopted and implemented a technology the humans refer to as 'air conditioning.' We never need fear the fire again!" <nl> The assembled demons cheered, Lilith included. <nl> "So we're free to go?" she asked. "We're not bound by fire anymore?" <nl> "That's right!" the toothy demon smiled again. <nl> The rest of the assembled demons shifted uneasily from one clawed foot to the other though. <nl> Lilith looked back at the damned humans. They remained bound, but didn't look quite as pained as they normally did. Lilith used her talon to stab Richard in the side. It wouldn't be professional for him to lose sight of pain for too long, and she was nothing, if not a professional demon. <nl> She took great pride in what she did--humans who wasted their lives hurting people deserved nothing less in death. It kept a kind of balance in the world. A balance that would be upset if she left. <nl> "What if we don't want to go?" she asked. A murmur of assent rose from the crowd. <nl> The demon smile grew even wider, revealing a previously unseen fifth row of teeth. "Then stay! And continue your torture with the added comfort of air conditioning!" <nl> A cheer rose up from the crowd, and they slithered, scurried, crawled, and walked back to their caves, their damned charges groaning in despair behind them. <nl> It was sometimes nice, Lilith reflected, to have options. Options can help set your priorities in order. With the choice to leave, she had realized that there was no place like home. Contentedly, she snapped her fingers, turning the ropes that bound Richard into venomous snakes. <nl> Hell isn't that bad of a place, she thought. If you can appreciate it. <nl> Behind her, Richard screamed. <eos>

<sos> And the Lord chose the purest of mind, the noblest of heart, and the deepest of pockets wings and with those they flew far, far away. Away from the home they had themselves had demolished. <nl> -Post Exodus 4:13 <nl> *** <nl> Bethany Angross had finally done it. <nl> She stared down at the hole she had just uncovered, and it was...glowing. Glowing just as the ancient scriptures, or specifically, Encyclopedia R, said it would. Radioactive material. Right here, its glow reflected in Bethany's eyes. Her blond hair was covered in dirt and her arm throbbed from the shoveling - the laborers couldn't be trusted to handle delicate excavation, but Bethany was on top of the world. <nl> Lara, her assistant, raven haired and almost a shadow of the charismatic Bethany took a step back. <nl> "Is...is this?" she asked, her voice shaking. <nl> Bethany grinned ear to ear. "You say the signs, the writing, the telltale shape of the ruins. We've done it, Lara. We've found radioactive material!" <nl> Lara swallowed, failed and tried again. "B...but, Beth, you've read the scriptures. You know just looking at it..." <nl> Bethany rolled her eyes. "Right, looking at it can melt the flesh off my bones. Well, I'm looking at it, and, my skin seems remarkably intact." <nl> "Bu-" Lara began but Bethany cut her off. <nl> "Oh, cut me a break Lara," Bethany said with a snort, "you sound like those religious nuts. Next you'll say some of the humans got into a spaceship and flew to the moon." <nl> Lara turned red, but for once, didn't just roll over to her superior. "Beth, *please* this is dangerous!" <nl> But Bethany shook her head in amusement and went down to the radioactive metal, hoping to collect a sample. <nl> *** <nl> **72 hours later** <nl> Bethany is sitting on a stage, the reporters, spies, and delegates furiously scribbling. <nl> "We have confirmed the existence of radioactive material," Bethany proclaimed loudly to the audible gasps of some. "I've let a select few world leaders in to see the metal and they have exclusive first had accounts of feeling, touching, seeing etcetera. Some had even taken samples home." <nl> There were a few groans at this, especially from the reporters who had been denied entry. Bethany tried to speak but broke into a fir of coughing. She shook her head then continued. Just the nerves. Becoming the most important person on the planet would have that effect. These people would not just report to people, but some directly to kings and presidents. Everyone hung on to her every word. <nl> "But I am here to tell you and confirm, that I, I mean, my team has become the first to confirm the existence of something previously thought to be one of the many exaggerations found in the scriptures-" <nl> "HEATHEN" <nl> Everyone turned to look at a strangely dressed man in the corner. While everyone else wore flowing robes, he wore what they called "pants and shirt." He looked completely ridiculous. <nl> "The scriptures tell no lies, Heathen," the man screamed, practically foaming at the mouth. "You know the stories, the sickness that comes with it. You will feel the judgement soon, as our ancestors did when the best of us left us to fester in this rotting place!" <nl> "No lies, of course," Bethany said and coughed. "It is common knowledge that humans went to the moon and wielded weapons to decimate entire countries." The reporters laughed. <nl> The priest began to say something else but was cut off by a couple of musket wielding guards. <nl> "Get him out of here," Bethany said, disgusted. <nl> *** <nl> **120 Hours later** <nl> Bethany Angross was dead along with her assistant Lara and most of their team. <nl> She died in a pool of blood and vomit in her bathtub. Sketches were not provided and the scene was described as "hideous." <nl> All of the select people who had been lucky enough to see the radioactive material were coughing and sweating. Symptoms of the sickness. <nl> People have turned to previously fading Exodians religious group. Once a dominant force in the world it had been fading as people turned to true hard facts, not myth and legend.  Yet, faced with something science cannot explain, people turn to Faith, and so it was. <nl> Coups across several countries happened, orchestrated by madmen or the Exodians. Seemingly overnight a new world order emerged as the world leaders died of radiation poisoning. They had either been there to see it or come in contact with someone who had. <nl> They called it the Night of Awakening. <nl> *** <nl> Under the guidance of the Exodians, money is finally funneled towards research of the scriptures. Everyday another impossibility is realized. It was the beginning of a reawakening, a new enlightenment of man. And in some ways, the beginning of the end.

<sos> The glow of a monitor cut through my darkened room. I idly sipped on a coffee, while flipping through online posts on my phone. Even in those short moments I stepped away from the keyboard, I didn't disconnect from the game, checking what people had to say about The Kingless Realm. Mostly, the messages complained. After all, only the people upset with something bothered to stop playing long enough to type it up, so every message board ended up full of cynicism. If I only looked there, I'd never believe that tens of millions of people played happily every day. <nl> When my coffee ran out, I put away my phone, and rinsed the mug, leaving it on the draining board to dry. Then, I stretched out all the creaks in my arms and shoulders and headed back to the glow. The seat groaned as I eased myself down, even though I was all skin and bones. Lights flickered across the keyboard, every letter clear in the dim state of my room that I preferred. A soft, red light showed where my mouse sat, always easy to find. <nl> Giving the mouse a little shake, the monitor flickered from a bright blackness to a vibrant scene. Tall trees sprang out of green grass, both together like brown walls and an emerald floor, and high above a brilliant blue sky with a few wispy clouds skittering across it made a ceiling. The fidelity transcended reality. Even if I put my nose to the screen and squinted, the pixel size had reached the point I couldn't spot them, and the graphics of the game itself had such realism that I could have spent an afternoon counting the blades of grass without finding anything uncanny. The big draw had been the support of virtual reality devices, but I didn't want to bother paying more money to play worse. When it came to games, the versatility of keyboard and mouse had always served me best. <nl> Once I settled in, I realised that my character didn't stand alone on the screen. A handful of burly men--the male power fantasy incarnate--loosely surrounded me, the chat log full of transcriptions from their voice chat. Putting on my headphones, I turned on local voice chat to hear what kind of people they were, since transcripts were only so accurate and couldn't convey tone and all that. <nl> "Come on, talk to us a little. We don't bite cuties like you." His voice--Gilgasmash his name in the game--irritated me. It had an edge of humour to it, like everything he said was a joke only he and his friends were in on. A familiar tone, even if I'd never met him before. <nl> Flicking down the microphone on my headset, I reluctantly spoke. "Sorry, I just had to go to the bathroom, but I'm back now." <nl> "Ah, you're actually a girl? Your character's so cute, I thought you had to be some nerd crossplaying." <nl> I snorted. Then, after clearing my throat and pressing down the push-to-speak button, I let out more of a tittering laugh. "These are just the clothes I like. Are they really that strange?" I asked, the pleasant tone belying the blank expression on my face. <nl> "No, no--I said you're super cute, right?" <nl> "Rea-lly?" I asked, drawing out the word. <nl> The way he nodded then, and otherwise gestured, made me sure he played using a virtual reality setup. "Of course! Isn't she the cutest, guys?" he asked, looking at his friends. <nl> Paindragon agreed in a nasally voice, while the other three just nodded and came half a step closer, emphasising the encircling. A smirk on my lips, my gaze flicked between their names before down to my phone, slipping it out my pocket to check a post I'd seen earlier. <nl> "Anyway," Gilgasmash said, "what's a cutie like you doing here? It's dangerous for noobs, you know." <nl> "Ah? Really? Someone told me I can level quickly if I come here." <nl> He replied in a tone so patronising I rolled my eyes. "They were lying to you. Don't worry, there's people like that here, but there's nice people too. Come on, we'll guide you back so no monsters attack you." <nl> "You will?" <nl> "Yeah. If we help each other, then everyone has more fun, right?" <nl> I snorted again, and somehow brought myself to emote a smile in the game. "That's so nice of you." <nl> "Come on, just follow us," he said, setting off. <nl> Well, I followed along so diligently. While they kept chatting at me, I'd returned to flicking through posts on my phone and offering an, "Ah," and, "Uh huh," from time to time. All the while, their voices had that tone of being in on a joke I didn't know. <nl> From the vibrant woods, we entered a decaying forest, lush greenery replaced with greying, bony trees that swayed to the background music full of violins playing minor notes. Rather than bare earth, the ground looked to be ash, but the lore said that the remains of men and monsters alike had been ground down to dust. <nl> "We're nearly there, sweetie. Don't worry." <nl> "Okay," I said, voice cheery as I put down my phone. <nl> The path they followed led us to a resurrection stone. While everything else looked dead in this land, the stone glowed with its usual ethereal light, gently humming. "Here, touch this and then you can use your teleport skill to go home." <nl> "Really? It's that easy?" I asked, flipping through my toolbars from the herbalist skills to my battle ones. <nl> "Yeah. It would be annoying if you went all this way and then needed to go back, right? So they added these stones that charge up your teleport spell for you." <nl> I rolled my eyes. "That's so handy. But, I'm not sure--can you do it first?" <nl> He hesitated for a moment, his character standing still as a couple of seconds passed, and then he stepped forward, touching the stone and being engulfed in a cool, blue light. "There, see? Nothing to worry about." <nl> "What about your friends? Are they gonna stay here when we go back?" <nl> With a little reluctance, they all activated the stone, too, at his insistence. "We're all ready now, so it's just you left." <nl> "Well, I guess you've been so kind," I said, clicking on the stone and then confirming the action when it popped up to ask me. <nl> Just like them, a blue light enveloped my character, followed by a message telling me my respawn point had been changed to the Hollow Woods. <nl> Then, a laughter broke through, followed one by one until the group of men filled the voice chat with their laughing. When it finally died down, Gilgasmash stepped in front of me, and his voice no longer had anything but a pitiable smugness to it. <nl> "You saw the message, right? This is where you're gonna respawn if you die," he said. <nl> "Oh dear, does that mean the teleport spell will bring me back here as well?" <nl> Though his face didn't show a leer--his virtual reality device probably one of the cheap ones that only did posture and gesture capture--his tone did. "What teleport spell? This game doesn't have one, idiot." <nl> "So, you lied to me?" <nl> He stepped forward to be right in my face. "Yeah. You're so gullible, I couldn't help myself. Following people so easily, what are you? A dog? No, you need a leash for a dog, but you just followed us anyway." <nl> "You know, it really should have given me a warning if I'm changing my respawn to somewhere high level." <nl> "It does, but you must have ignored it like the stupid bitch you are." <nl> "Then, what about a warning that this is a P v P area?" <nl> He laughed again, a kind of bark. "So you ignored that one as well? You really deserve this." <nl> "Eh? Deserve what? Are you going to do something to me?" <nl> He emoted a smile as the others surrounded me. "You see, we can spend all day killing you, and you'll respawn right back here for us to kill again. Doesn't that sound fun?" <nl> "Not really. I mean, I'll lose some money and items if I die, won't I?" <nl> "No, not just some--all. There's nothing we love more than putting people like you in your place." <nl> My gaze darted to my phone, before returning back to the screen. "So, there's nothing I can do? You're just going to try and kill me over and over?" <nl> "That's right. Well, you can beg, and maybe we'll let you keep that cute outfit of yours. But, even if you run, the monsters will kill you and bring you right back here. So, there's nothing you can do." <nl> "Really?" <nl> A round of laughter broke out from them. "Sorry, sweetie, you should've known better than playing this game just because your boyfriend does." <nl> Checking each of them again, they varied between the low seventies and mid eighties in their levels, the gear they wore decent enough but none of the top stuff found in the raids and dungeons. Their names matched. <nl> I picked up my phone and tapped a reply to one of the messages I'd seen, telling the poster of it to log in soon. <nl> "Well, little girl, are you ready to die?" <nl> "Didn't you all touch the stone too?" <nl> He clicked his tongue and said, "So what?" <nl> My finger hovered over the button to toggle idle mode on and off. "Doesn't that mean you'll also respawn here if you die?" <nl> "So?" <nl> I smirked in real life, easing down the button until I heard a beautiful click. <nl> *Continued in the replies* <eos>

<sos> After an exhausting day in the yard, sleep came quickly to Alice. She lay her head on the pillow and slipped into her usual evening world of dreams - laying under the tree watching the birds, walking along the sands of her favorite beach while letting the waves lap upon her. Alice looked forward to her nights of dreaming, especially after long days. <nl> Tonight, though, her dreams were not to be so peaceful. Alice awoke sharply, greeted by the familiar pain of claws to her ear and Eva standing over her, looking down. It wasn't unusual for the family cat to decide midnight was an appropriate time to be seeking attention, but it was certainly out of the ordinary for her to speak. <nl> "That's so you know this is real. Follow me, we haven't much time.", said the cat. <nl> Alice looked around, noting that the sun had still not risen, and that others in the home still slept soundly. "Look, Eva, if you're talking to me and I understand you, then this most certainly is a dream." Eva sliced out with her claws again, this time drawing a little blood from the other ear. "Let's not keep doing this, you're out of ears now and we're almost out of time. Get up, follow me, now." The cat turned and began to sneak her way along the hallway, avoiding the plastic matting covering the carpet from stains as if it were lava. Alice followed, wearily, but concerned. <nl> At the end of the hallway was the kitchen, and beyond that, through a dark portal guarded by the baby gate, was the garage. Eva squeezed herself through the gate and pounced upwards from the other side, releasing the catch, allowing the gate to swing open. Alice wasn't even aware she could do that, but she was definitely impressed. The cat beckoned Alice into the garage and moved off towards the shelving units behind the car. <nl> Alice thought for a moment before proceeding into the garage. This would be much easier if she were to simply turn the light on instead of creeping around with an animal known to have good night vision, but then, she's following a talking cat, so it's probably best to just do what the cat instructs at this point. <nl> As Alice rounded the car, Eva jumped up onto the workbench. "So, here's the deal. My toy is stuck under this bag, which is way to heavy for me to move by myself. If you move it for me, I get my toy, and you can go back to whatever it is your kind do. Do we have an accord?" <nl> "You... you just want your toy? You said we didn't have much time, I thought this was important!" Alice growled, angrily. "It is important", replied Eva, "as if I don't have my toy then I'll tear apart the sofa, and if I tear apart the sofa during the night then we both know what's going to happen, and I'm trying to prevent that. We both know you can move the bag, and we both know you're going to, so let's just get this over with." <nl> Alice was taken aback by the cats logic, though also slightly saddened by her motives behind this impromptu alliance. Ever since the cat had first been adopted, Alice had tried to find some way of gaining her affection, but it would seem the only way to do that was to become a disposable part of a nighttime garage raid. So be it, she thought, at least it was a start. <nl> John awoke to crashing sounds from the garage. He reached over to behind his nightstand and grabbed the baseball bat he kept for just this kind of time. He crept along the hallway, avoiding the plastic matting which crinkled and cracked under weight. He tread lightly over the laminate wood in the kitchen, avoiding the sticking sounds his feet would make across it. With a deep breath, he flicked the garage light on - "STOP RIGHT THERE!" he yelled. <nl> Eva bolted from sight before his eyes had time to adjust, toy grasped tightly in her mouth. Alice started, her paws failing to gain meaningful traction on the concrete floor, as John looked across the car to find her flailing in a pile of kibble, the bag of food split wide open under the workbench. "Right, that's enough, you're going in your cage for the night." He grabbed her collar and led her firmly to her cell, locking the door once she was in, and returned to bed. <nl> "Thanks", said Eva, "maybe I owe you one." <nl> *[edit - missing word]* <eos>

<sos> Allison tried, unsuccessfully, to blow a recalcitrant lock of hair out of her face. She tried re-positioning her lower lip a few times, and then, finally, with a sigh, reached up and brushed it behind her ear. *All these powers and I can't even get my hair to obey me*, she thought. <nl> As she scanned the canned vegetables, she became increasingly aware of a voice behind her. A voice that sounded like tires on a gravel road. A voice she had heard many times before, usually growling commands or issuing edicts. She paused, listening more carefully to the words of this man she had come to loathe, this full embodiment of everything she despised. <nl> "Kidney...pinto...black...lima...even *navy*. Why the hell would I want navy beans? What the fuck is a navy bean?" <nl> Allison smirked, and went back to examining the tomatoes. She was, truth be told, not having much more luck than *Mason*, behind her. All she wanted was diced tomatoes. Just regular diced tomatoes. She had stewed tomatoes, and diced tomatoes with garlic and herbs, and whole tomatoes... <nl> "Excuse me. *Excuse* me." <nl> Allison froze, her hand on a can of low-sodium diced tomatoes - *I can always add salt later* had been her thought. But now one of the fingers of the man who had once nearly shattered her kneecap was poking her in the ribs. <nl> "Do you work here?" he growled. She couldn't help the burst of laughter that escaped her. First, because Mason was thinking that *she* worked at the SaveMart. As *if*. And second...God, he even does it *out* of costume. She had always assumed the absurd vocal register he used was affected, something he did to intimidate his opponents, but no...he sounded like a chain-smoker that had spent the morning gargling bits of scrap metal. <nl> Allison fought back her smile and turned to look at her nemesis. He was...oh, God. She put a hand to her face, her cheeks twitching. He was a good half-foot *shorter* than she was. Which meant... <nl> Her mind flashed on his costume. The ochre-colored lycra unitard, the visored helmet, and the tall black boots. She had never considered...he actually...but how? Not just lifts, surely, because...I mean, he *loomed* over her when they fought. And the heels weren't that tall, she'd have noticed if her arch-enemy went around wearing go-go boots. <nl> A thrill of pity pierced her heart. This poor, short, self-conscious man. Her eyes went to the growing swath of exposed scalp visible among his dark hair. There was what looked to be a chocolate stain on the middle of his t-shirt, a garment, she noticed, that was not up to the task of covering his paunch. *Oh God, that must mean he wears a* girdle, *too!* His ratty sweatpants were growing increasingly threadbare in the one area you wanted them to be most thread-rich, such that she could tell that he was wearing bright-orange boxers. <nl> Allison slowly lowered her hand, and looked straight into the eyes of the man who, not that long ago, had cost her two billion dollars. And she made a decision. <nl> "Yes, I do. How can I help you?" <nl> He gestured meekly to the cans behind him. "I'm just...I'm looking for refried beans. For my lunch. And I don't see them anywhere." <nl> "Oh. Yeah, they're two aisles over, in Hispanic foods." <nl> "Well, if you don't mind me saying, that doesn't make any kind of sense. In a world besieged by villainy, why are you people scattering beans across the store like it's some God-damned scavenger hunt? This is utter chaos!" <nl> Allison bit down hard on her bottom lip until her eyes began to water. *Same old Mason*, she thought. "I'm...sorry, sir. I'll be sure to relay your concerns to my manager." <nl> "See that you do," the hero sneered, and then turned and headed towards the back of the store. Allison noticed that he was not only wearing socks with his sandals, but for some reason they were *dress* socks. <nl> Allison lingered before the canned tomatoes for some time after he left. *I*, she thought, *am going to have to find him a girlfriend.* <nl> *** <nl> /r/ShadowsofClouds <eos>

<sos> I groaned as I loaded the last of my laundry into the machine. Another night, another fight. How did she *do* it? He had sworn he had covered his tracks well... the initial strike hadn't even been in person! Just drop a disc in the company parking garage, and next thing you know, you've got a dozen different passwords because people *love* cat videos. <nl> Then just drop in the building and download what you want off their servers. Easy. <nl> Until Scarlet Shot shows up while you're making your get away and complete wrecks your shit with a few bullets. <nl> Had to give it to her: she's a hell of a shot for shooting off my belt without shooting me. Unfortunately, that meant the whole thing fell about 50 stories and completely destroyed the drives. <nl> Still, couldn't complain too much after she tackled me... <nl> I grinned and backed up to kick the dryer close. <nl> "Hey!" <nl> "Woah! Hey, I'm sorry, miss..." I turned around to see a young woman with red hair and green eyes. Apartment 3A, upstairs from me. Probably here with the water out in our building, like I was. <nl> But she had a fierce black eye. I could trace the rope burn on her wrist where my whip had caught her, trying to get her gun out of her hand (she had just pulled out a second, smaller one after that -- guess she'd learned from our previous fight...) I could almost see the imprint of my boot heel above her knee where I'd had to kick her off. <nl> Of course, if all of that hadn't been telling enough, the deep red suit she was trying to desperately cover in her basket was enough. <nl> How hadn't I seen it before? <nl> I smiled. "Why, hello, Scar--" <nl> She grabbed my shirt and pulled me down to meet her eyes. "You finish that, *Drake*, and I swear the cops will find a reason to raid your apartment." <nl> Ooh. When'd she find out my first name? "I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage, then. I hadn't thought to spy on my neighbors to get their names." <nl> She sniffed and let me go. "*I* didn't. Mrs. Lane introduced us when I moved in, but you just waved us off." <nl> That sounded about right. I usually ignored Mrs. Lane unless she was demanding to be let in to check the apartment, which usually meant storing away my latest project. No wonder I hadn't put two and two together. A pretty girl being busted up every time I was? It was easy to buy the martial arts training excuse. Especially when she *did* go to the dojo regularly. "I'm very sorry I did, then. Maybe we can start over?" <nl> She raised an eyebrow and didn't take my offered hand. "I'm just here to do my laundry. *Not* play nice." <nl> "Hey, funny thing! So am I! But that doesn't mean we *couldn't*." <nl> Okay, maybe I was coming on too strong. I suppose I deserved the elbow to the gut as she turned away to load her clothes in the driers down at the far end. <nl> Still, I waited until hers had to started to start mine. Didn't hurt to linger a bit. <nl> She settled on the plastic monstrosities laundromats like to call chairs and pulled out a phone. One of the new Apple products. I sat on the table opposite her. "Didn't know heroing paid that well." <nl> "Are you just going to annoy me while my laundry's going?" <nl> "No... just.... sorry about your eye." <nl> "What?" She looked up. Damn, I'd hit her hard. She looked like a poster child for a domestic abuse campaign. <nl> I pointed to my eye. "Your eye. Sorry about it. Didn't think I'd gotten you that hard." <nl> "It's nothing. I've gotten harder hits at my gym." <nl> "Right... right... still, I'll try to avoid your face from now on." <nl> "I don't need any favors from *you*." And she's back to the phone. Damn it. <nl> "Of course not, but I figure I owe you a favor. See, you're *not* calling the cops right now, and you haven't before this. Which means either you figured it out before I did, or you've just decided to keep silent. So, you know, I can at least make your neighbors stop asking how you got hurt this time." <nl> "You've heard that much, but not my *name*?" Finally, got her attention. <nl> "You're 3A. That's all I needed. But, hey, tell me your name, and I'll go get us some ice cream. Make it an official truce for today while we desperately wait for the water lines to be fixed." <nl> A laugh. A small win. "I'm going to go back to my car. I don't need ice cream with somebody who doesn't know my name." <nl> "Then after I learn your name?" <nl> She just chuckled and shook her head as she exited the building, heading to the Oldsmobile outside the doors. Why did her driving the land yacht not surprise me? <nl> But Dolmen was going to have to wait for his files. I had a new campaign to start. <nl> *** <nl> Did a sort of prequel here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/95jk1a/wp\_the\_hero\_and\_villain\_are\_roommates\_but\_dont/e3tqqjy/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/95jk1a/wp_the_hero_and_villain_are_roommates_but_dont/e3tqqjy/?context=3) <eos>

<sos> Ms. Ellis' fingernails dig into the table, leaving marks on the wooden surface.  She stares at the words that appeared on the wall from their conversation earlier.  Her attempts to reach for the chisel in front of her are pointless as she is chained to her chair. <nl> The demon chuckles as it sits on the stool nearby.  "I don't see why you're so bent out of shape.  It's a perfectly common practice." <nl> Ms. Ellis can feel the veins on her temple throbbing. <nl> The demon continues.  "I mean, it's no less common as ending sentences with a preposition, starting sentences with 'however' or saying 'email' instead of 'e-mail.'" <nl> Word for word, the sentence slowly etches itself into the wall.  Ms. Ellis' breathing intensifies.  She realized quickly that if she isn't careful, her sentence appears up on the wall too. <nl> The demon turns and smiles.  "Oh look, another example, right below this one about who I invited here. You remember, right?  It's the one where I invited the giant gargoyles, Charlie Chaplin and Groucho Marx?" <nl> Another sentence appears.  Deeper nail marks on the table. <nl> "What shall we ask them to bring?  How about something to drink, cake and pie?" <nl> Another sentence. <nl> "And when they get here, let's play some soothing music, heavy metal and polka."  Another- <nl> Ms. Ellis slams her fists on the table.  "PUT IN THE OXFORD COMMA, YOU MONSTER!" <eos>

<sos> Throughout the history of life on Earth, there has really only ever been one constant. Death. During the long period before the Cambrian, entire ecosystems popped into existence only to collapse with the rise of modern taxons at the dawn of the Paleozoic. Between the Permian and the Triassic, a rapid temperature increase brought about by volcanic activity in Siberia meant the end for more than ninety percent of everything that showed up in the fossil record. The great ancestors of the birds were then able to diversify. They spread out across the Earth and lived for over a hundred million years, growing from small creatures that scrambled through the underbrush into behemoths that shook the Earth as they moved. Then, a random hammerblow from a member of the Flora asteroid family cut them down. Within a decade, all that remained were bones turning to fossils in the sediment left by the first thunderstorms after a ten year winter. <nl> Humanity had a good run. We rose from a pretty unexceptional branch of the mammal family tree, closely related to the rodents and a little more closely related to the tree shrews, to complete dominance over all life on Earth. Well, at least all macroscopic life. The enormous brains gifted to us by a few fluke mutations allowed us to shape the world to our whim. Entire environments were wiped out and created. Prairies turned to farmland, savannahs turned to desert, saltwater estuaries turned to concrete canyons, and tropical rainforests turned to ashes and wasted pastureland. Along the way, though, we dug up the bones left in the sandstone hills that had once been thunderstorm runoff. We saw those enormous creatures, along with the older amphibian monsters that had dessicated and then been buried beneath the dunes of the desert in the heart of Pangea. <nl> The rules were clear. Death was a constant. <nl> There wasn't any real surprise in 2667, when JESSICA sounded her warning. By that point, we had learned to divert and even mine smaller asteroids like the one that hit Chicxulub, but we still knew that the nature of the Great Game of Life hadn't changed. A real monster, whipping in from interstellar (or in this case, intergalactic) space, could not be diverted. Echidna was a body from the Oort Cloud of a solar system thrown our way when two enormous spiral galaxies collided long before the formation of the Earth. Its star had died and the orbiting bodies had been scattered by gravitational encounters. <nl> Echidna wasn't that large in the big scheme of things. Half the size of Pluto, maybe. The big scheme of things didn't matter. She was going to hit the Earth at a thousandth of the speed of light. The crust of the Earth wasn't even going to shatter. With heat that high, it would turn to liquid near instantaneously. The predicted zone of impact, the Precambrian craton of South Africa, was going to splatter, a wave of liquid rock that would partially solidify as it came back down, creating second impacts ahead of a storm of something that could only be called fire by rough analogy. <nl> There was no way that the off world colonies could support fifteen billion new people. The Moon was evacuated due to the high likelihood of secondary impacts, then JESSICA shut down the ports on Mars to all incoming traffic. Autonomous supply vessels still left the Vastitas Borealis for the few manned asteroid mines and the research stations on Europa (along with the single lonely Japanese outpost near the South Pole of Enceladus). Anyone coming in, though, would be shot out of the reddish grey sky by a railgun under the direct control of the WC. She entrusted no one else with the responsibility. <nl> The message was clear. Mars wasn't suitable for mankind yet. Life there was underground, whether in the human-made caverns under the enormous boreal plain or in the natural, water-filled caverns blocked to all exploration by international treaty due to their native microbial colonies. In time, it would become a home. For now, though, the resources just weren't there. The asteroids would never sustain us. Any ship small enough to evade JESSICA's watchful eyes would have no hope of even reaching the icey moons, where massive, dark oceans hid the kilometers-long, glowing bodies of their eternal sovereigns. Our only real home in the solar system, for now, was Earth. It would soon belong to JESSICA alone. She would not be deactivated like the other World Controllers when her tome came to be replaced, it had been decided. Like the others, she would be stored in a data center buried in the rocky crust of 4-Vesta, but unlike the others she would sent back to rebuild as soon as the Earth cooled enough for that to be possible. She could have an entire world and its material wealth to expand into. She would be a god. For her part, JESSICA really had nothing to say on the issue. I was one of the custodians present when the Governing Assembly called her up to give her the news. They actually had us haul one of her larger projectors into the Chamber in Tokyo, so that she could stand there in the center of the giant hall in a form conjured up from the air. Nominally it was to check her response. Maybe they just felt more comfortable telling this to something that looked like a human being. <nl> None of them knew that the seven year-old in a green and yellow floral sundress, with curly black hair down to her waist and a straw gardening hat, was a real person. Most of the others were amalgamations of fictional and historical children. This one was the daughter of the engineer who built the cooling systems, Dr. Patric Isidoku. Her real name was Akhona, I think. JESSICA had been picked out two hundred years before for the 2630 Series WC. They managed to salvage enough of her brain to culture all of the cell lines for the computer's biological components. JESSICA wasn't Akhona, really, but I do wonder if she was somehow more human than her predecessors. Sounds ridiculous, I know, but her expression and her silence that day stuck with me. <nl> For those human beings left waiting for the impact, though, there were a few decisions left to be made. Did we wait to die? Choose euthanasia? A few really did attempt to make it to Mars. That was euthanasia by a different route. A lot fewer turned to religious extremism or to hedonism than you might expect, at least in the first three years. <nl> I opted for a longshot. A fleet of four "arks" were approved for four solar systems with known habitable planets. They were packed with all settlers would need to establish self-sufficient colonies like those on Mars. Still, a long shot. No human interstellar missions had ever been attempt because of all that could go wrong over the course of, for the shortest trip, just under four centuries. <nl> I booked a trip on the *Hope*. The ship with the shortest voyage, *Prayer*, had already filled. When the *Hope* left its dockyard in Low-Earth Orbit, we all filed into the cryo storage rooms. None of us really expected to wake up again. Most of us didn't. <nl> Not that it mattered. <nl> See, here's the thing. Echidna was still three years out. JESSICA used that time to study alternative options, mostly in secret, and she finally found one. Travel through hyperspace had been discussed before, but it seemed impossible to fit anything larger than a hydrogen atom into that compact place. She figured it out, though, and with a year to spare and a dozen planets within easy reach, Grey Ridge, the planet we were headed to, wasn't even part of the first wave of settlement. The mountains in that Ridge were too high and too broad, I guess. Not as much room for agriculture as some of the others. <nl> I'm not unhappy, looking down from the enormous window of the *Hope* across the night side of a world illuminated with centers and corridors of light. I know that I made the most rational decision that I could have, all things considered. <nl> The other ships were intcepted, because their paths crossed the great hyperspace routes. Their cargo was destroyed *en route*, because it wasn't really *just* a cargo of humans, food, and animals. <nl> JESSICA, as the core of the Galactic Controller, told us that she had been unable to find our beacon and assumed us lost. Then, she apologized for not destroying us in our blissful unconsciousness. <nl> In just over half a millennium, mankind crossed that last barrier to dominance of all life. Humanity wiped out all pathogens. Both human diseases and agricultural pests. All those not inadvertently put in cold storage and shot out into the stars, at any rate. <nl> We have two minutes left before one of the few nuclear weapons still in existence detonates in the core of the *Hope*. Two thousand megatons will make one hell of a light show for the people on the coasts of the giant southern continent. <nl> I don't blame them at all, but I do hope that they still understand the rules of the Game. You can't kill death with fusing deuterium. It finds everyone eventually. <nl> -MiNX- <eos>

<sos> "You never needed a fairy like me.  But now you come to me and you say - 'Donna Faerieleone, give me  justice.' But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship.  You don't even think to call me Godmother. Instead, you come into my house on the day my evil step-daughter is to be married, and you ask me to do murder for money." <nl> "I ask for justice," hissed Cinderella, a glass slipper clutched to her chest. <nl> "Justice, what do you know about justice?" asked the Godmother as she twisted a sprig of holly in her plump hands. <nl> "I know nothing of justice. The only thing I know is that for one fleeting moment I had love. Indescribable love. A love so pure that it must be sealed with True Love's first kiss...at least, until..." <nl> Cinderella's voice trembled as she spoke and a solitary tear rolled down her quivering chin to drip upon the shimmering glass slipper. <nl> "The clock strikes midnight for us all, my dear. What matters is what we do once the spell fades into the dawn of a happily ever-after," finished the Godmother, listening to the fanfare and celebration beckoning to her from the other side of her office door. <nl> Cinderella nodded her head and pleaded silently across the orante office desk. <nl> "And this you ask of me? This deed that will be recorded in tales of men and faeries forever. You wish this of me?" asked the Godmother. <nl> Cinderella's eyes hardened and her chin lost its quiver. "With all my heart". <nl> The Fairy Godmother leaned forward. "Good. Someday, and that day may never come, I'll call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day - accept this 'justice' as a gift on my evil step-daughter's wedding day." <nl> She lifted her plump and bejeweled hand, which Cinderella grasped and kissed tenderly and gratefully. <nl> "Merci, Donna Faerieleone. If I can't have Prince Charming...then no one can," said Cinderella dropping the glass slipper to shatter upon the floor. <eos>

<sos> "See you tomorrow," Maizy Potter waved at the group gathered around the nurse's station on her way out. <nl> "Don't forget your birthday cake!" One of the male nurses, Sean, said. He bolted into the breakroom and returned with a foil covered rectangle twice the size of his large hands. "Enjoy your day off tomorrow, happy birthday again!" Sean leaned in for a hug which Maizy politely returned. She liked Sean well enough, but thanks to her gift she knew more about his private life than she should. There wasn't anything particularly offensive, but she did not share an interest in the private things that he definitely loved. <nl> "Thanks, Sean. See you on Sunday. Oh, you have to let me know when Mrs. Sanchez delivers. That poor woman has been in labor since before I started my shift." She switched the subject to work as she left. As she made her way down to the first floor and out of the building Maizy thanked the heavens for small miracles. If she were not working the hospital's nursery when her ability developed she might have gone crazy. However, being able to watch the children age day by day helped her learn to use and control her power. <nl> "Have a nice evening, Maizy," the security guard nodded at her as she left the hospital. After she stepped outside Maizy turned left instead of walking to the parking lot. She lived close enough to walk and the weather forecast promised a bright, cool evening. Two blocks away from the hospital she approached what she called, "Deadman's Alley" in her own mind. Even before her ability kicked in she often found homeless persons dead or dying in the alley. She assumed it was due to the alleys proximity to the hospital. Once she knew how to read people, she occasionally tried to help a random vagabond. Maizy could use her ability to more or less guess a stranger's medical history. She peeked into the alley as she passed it. One body slept soundly sandwiched between two layers of newspapers. <nl> "He'd probably like some cake," she smiled to herself. She approached quietly to avoid waking him. "Oh, I better check if he's diabetic," she reminded herself, then gave him a quick read with her ability. <nl> "What the hell?!" she said loudly, and accidentally dropped the cake on top of the man's head. He stirred immediately. <nl> "People tryin'ta sleep!" he grumbled and rolled over. He pulled a newspaper over his head. <nl> "Hey! Who are you?" she asked. <nl> "Nobody," the man replied. <nl> "You've been around for an unusually long amount of time, Mr. Nobody." Maizy knelt to pick up the cake as she spoke. The man sat up and looked at her, though he did not expect her to be that close. He yelped in surprise and hurriedly crab-walked himself backward, away from Maizy. His hands and feet crumpled the newspapers as he trampled them. <nl> "How do you know that?" the man asked. He looked up at Maizy with fear in his eyes. His eyes darted around the alley looking for an escape, but he unintentionally cornered himself when Maizy startled him. Her nurse's instincts kicked in when she realized how uncomfortable she made him.  Maizy looked around the alley and found three milk crates stacked up on top of each other. She walked over to it and sat down, keeping her eyes on the stranger the whole time. She placed the cake on her lap and held her hands up, palms outward. <nl> "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. I don't really tell people about this, but since you seem kind of odd yourself I think it's okay. I can see the lives people have lived up until the current day. I try not to use it to invade people's privacy," she held up the foil rectangle. "...but, I wanted to leave you some cake. I had to check if you were diabetic first. Are you diabetic? Do you want some cake?" She asked, and held the cake out without rising from her seat. The man nodded and slowly stood up from the floor. <nl> "So you saw my whole life?" he asked. Maizy shook her head. <nl> "I can, but I've gotten pretty good at not looking at the details. I was just looking for anything medically relevant but I noticed you had a lot more to go through than most people. I met a 104-year-old man once.  You've had a life at least 10 times as long, as far as I can tell. Who are you?" The stranger now stood close enough to take the cake from Maizy, but he shook his head when he answered her. <nl> "Like I said, nobody. Not here, anyway," he said. Maizy looked around the alleyway again. <nl> "Well why're you hanging out in an alley, then?" she asked, though she still did not move from the crates. <nl> "mmOH," he had his mouth full of cake and tried to swallow it while shakig his head. "Not the alley. I meant this Earth. I got stranded here last week. Hey, this is really good. Thank you," he smiled a toothy smile from behind the cake. <nl> "Wait what do you mean you're not from this Earth? Nothing I saw showed me you were an alien." Maizy asked intently. Something about him told her he was telling the truth, but she wanted to know everything. He was in the middle of the last bite of cake, but he answered her after he swallowed it. <nl> "Not an alien. I don't think they exist, but I'm from an alternate Earth. Someone I thought I could trust proved me wrong, and now I'm stranded here with no way to get home," he said. <nl> "Wow, I'm sorry. I can't even imagine what that's like. What's your Earth like? Is this one much different?" She asked. The man chuckled in response, and he sat down on the floor in front of Maizy. He seemed considerably more relaxed now. <nl> "It's pretty similar, but our tech is more advanced. I'm probably going to need to wait until your tech catches up before I get home," he sighed. <nl> "Will you live that long? I mean... I'm sorry. You're already so old. How long do you think it'll be before we catch up?" <nl> "Could be any time between now and 100 years," he said. <nl> "Wow," Maizy said. She realized that she made a snap decision at some point during the conversation, but she did not know when it happened exactly. "That's a long time to wait in an alley. How would you feel about living with me until you find your feet on this Earth? I'd love to hear all about your home Earth."  The stranger stared at Maizy trying to guess her intent, then looked at the ball of foil he crumpled up after he finished the dessert. <nl> "Will there be more cake?" he asked. <nl> \*\*\* <nl> Thank you for reading!

<sos> ######[](#dropcap) <nl> The first time it had happened, she had been ten. Armed with nothing but frustration and loneliness, she had willed Melinda into being. Melinda wasn't a pleasant girl--no--more reminiscent of the bullies that Lara had faced than the friend she had wanted, but she was company nonetheless. Sometimes Melinda would say things like, "your face is too chubby" or "get lost," but it didn't matter. They were tethered together. <nl> Until Melinda disappeared on the fifteenth of October on her thirteenth birthday, when Lara willed her away after a particularly nasty fight. Her mother was never around, having to work three jobs to support them after her father left, so her mother never knew. And it was years later that Lara would be thankful for it. <nl> The second time it had happened was when she was fourteen. Everyone knew that Bobby was a bad boy, but no one knew just how bad he was, relegating her life to hell on earth. She could never find her homework. Ever. Except when it would appear in front of the teacher's eyes with a different boy's name. <nl> There wasn't a scrape on her body that year that didn't bear his name. And when it had finally become too much, when she had finally broken down in the bathroom stall of her school, chunks of her hair just falling out as if they hadn't been attached to her head in the first place, Bobby simply...disappeared. <nl> Not gone in the way of missing posters, per se, but rather missing altogether, as if rather than a Bobby shaped hole in the universe where he used to be, the void had been filled by nothingness. No one knew he had ever existed. <nl> It was then that Lara realized Melinda might not have been an imaginary friend like her therapist had said after all. It was the first time she believed that there was something wrong with her in a way that wasn't wrong with anyone else. Because normal people didn't have Melindas, and normal people didn't know Bobby. And all she wanted was to be normal. <nl> The third time and the fourth time were more of a blur. Both times happened after breakups, and she wasn't entirely sure if it was the breakup that created the alternate universes or the loneliness that came after. All she knew was: sometimes she would wake up in a straw bed, the ocean front as her view, and other times she would wake up in a dimly lit cell, garbed in all white and pleading to be let out. <nl> The days blended together. <nl> At some point, she was one again, thanks to an accidental fire in the mental ward, which killed one of her, leaving only the other. She supposed she should be glad it was the one where she had no hope for a future. <nl> And maybe it would have continued this way forever. Until she found him. Around him, there was no pain, no loneliness. This was the fairy tale ending she had dreamed of her entire life. He brought her flowers, listened to her when she was sad, stood up for her when she couldn't stand up for herself. <nl> Her knight in shining armor. <nl> But no one told her the armor was to defend against *her*. <nl> One day, when the white picket fence was just within view, she overheard a conversation she should have never heard. And realized that he wasn't there because he wanted to, no, but as a duty. To humanity. To ensure she was happy, and to ensure what his superiors feared would never come to pass. <nl> Keep her happy, they said. Make sure no one else disappears. <nl> That day, Lara was the calmest she'd ever been. There was no outburst of emotion like there'd been before. No pain, no tears. Just realization. <nl> Her mother had always told her she was strong-willed. That she could do anything she put her mind to. So on the fifteenth of October, Lara did what should have been impossible. <nl> She willed herself out of existence. <nl> ***** <nl> If you liked this, you might like a fantasy story I wrote about a necromancer called [The Forsworn](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlannaWu/comments/8dm9bl/the_forsworn_parts_14/)! <nl> r/AlannaWu <eos>

<sos> Ping. <nl> 'Hi, my name is Julie and I've been married to my husband Paul for twelve years. Thing have been off in my marriage recently and I can't help but feel that my husband hasn't been acting himself. I never thought I'd be the person to do this, but could you investigate his whereabouts this weekend? I'm out of town and can't shake the horrible feeling that he ... well, you know. I've attached our home address. Please get back to me asap. Thanks, Julie.' <nl> Gene sighed as he read the email. He'd read hundreds like these before and unfortunately most of them turned out to be right. <nl> Ping. <nl> 'Two in one night? Strange.' <nl> 'I understand that you are a private investigator and I want you to follow my wife this weekend. She's away on a business trip, or so she says, but I think she's seeing someone else. I'll forward you where she'll be later. All I want is some evidence or something so I know I'm making the right decision if I do make it. Her name is Julie, and I'm Paul.' <nl> *This* was unusual. Gene scrambled out of bed, collecting all of the necessary gear on autopilot. Before he knew it, he was outside Paul's place, it only seemed fair to go there since Julie emailed first. The only light came from the living room and Paul was alone, staring blankly at the television screen with a beer in hand. Nothing untoward so far, but it was only 6pm. About an hour later, Paul picked up his phone. <nl> 'And so it begins...' <nl> Gene readied the parabolic microphone and tape as Paul started to pace around the room. <nl> 'Hey, it's me.' Paul's tone was uncertain, and it seemed he was rehearsing his lines before the call. Classic indication of an affair. 'I really want to see you tonight. I ... I need you more than I ever did. I can't wait any longer.' <nl> Paul threw the phone across the room; he must have changed his mind. <nl> This wasn't proof enough yet, so Gene had his camera zoom into Paul's phone to see who he had planned on calling. He was surprised by the name displayed clearly across the screen. <nl> Juliewifey. <nl> 'Was not expecting that.' <nl> Julie's hotel room was easy to find, it wasn't too far out of town and there was a cheap motel across the way. Gene's gut was telling him that Paul was faithful, and he knew that if Julie wasn't it wouldn't matter much either way. Plus, he was still getting paid double for the one job. <nl> Julie was also alone, and she was crying. <nl> 'I just don't know what to *do.* I miss him so much and I don't think he even cares, it's like he's not even here.' Julie paused. 'I know, I know. I'll let you know how it turns out obviously, I just wish...' <nl> Gene had seen enough. <nl> Paul was still alone, and the phone was in the same place he had left it. He was confused when the doorbell rang, and even more confused when he found nobody there but instead a cassette tape wrapped in brown paper. <nl> Julie started at the knock on the hotel door and hung up the phone. She opened the door to an identical tape on the floor. <nl> 'I think you both needed to hear this from each other. Kindest regards, Gene.' <eos>

<sos> ######[](#dropcap) <nl> Her head pounded. Luna groaned and brought a hand to her temple, massaging it. She was never going to drink again. Then again, it hadn't really been her choice. It had either been drink or suffer through another night of missing his sorry ass. <nl> Her eyes slowly blinked open. Above her head, the stars illuminated the night sky in a way she'd never seen before, shining so brightly she felt like she could almost reach up and catch one. <nl> Then she blinked again. <nl> The night sky? <nl> She shot up, her head whipping around and taking in the road lined with stone buildings. No wonder her pillow had been so hard. She'd been laying on the cobblestone path. The only light came from the torches that were set up in intervals along the road. <nl> Where are on earth was she?? She was supposed to be in her bedroom. <nl> Luna scrambled to her feet, taking in the empty streets and the medieval looking buildings. This couldn't be possible. No. There wasn't a single soul in sight, and the only sounds came from the crackling fire of the torches. <nl> "Hello?" she asked cautiously. <nl> Her voice--higher pitched than usual--echoed in the empty street. <nl> The silence was unnerving. So, rubbing her arms with her hands to warm them up against the slight chill of the night air, she moved on. If she could find someone, she could ask them what was going on. If this was some kind of sick joke. <nl> Walking up to the nearest house, she pulled up the bronze knocker and knocked three times. After a moment, no one had answered, so she knocked again. <nl> "Hello?" she yelled, cupping her hands around her mouth. "Is there anyone there?" <nl> Suddenly, she heard it. A sound like hooves clopping against cobble, and not just one, but many, many of them. Distant, but after a moment, they became accompanied by yelling and shouting. <nl> Luna panicked. She had no idea who these people might be, and if she'd really by some strange twist of fate ended up sometime else in history, the history lessons Mrs. Moore taught her didn't go forgotten. A girl sitting out in the streets meant certain death. <nl> So without a second thought, she began sprinting down the road as fast as her legs would take her. Faster than she'd ever run in her life, without daring to take a glance back. The sound of hooves grew closer, and she could hear the voices more clearly now. <nl> They didn't speak English. The speech patterns were smooth and rapid, but it was not a language she recognized. It was coming from a ways behind her, slightly to the left, but soon enough they would be on the road, and they would be able to see her. <nl> Just as she was about to break out in a sob, lamenting her fate, something tugged on her arm, dragging her into relative darkness. They slapped a hand against her face, muffling her cries, and dragged her deeper into the alleyway. <nl> She was going to die. <nl> She was going to die in some random place and time in history or in her dream, and she wouldn't have had a chance to apologize to her best friend. Even as she reached back to try to claw at the person, they nimbly dodged her attack. <nl> "Be quiet, unless you want to die." There was a slight accent to the guttural voice, but it was recognizably female. Confused, Luna stopped struggling. By now, they had left the main road a little ways, and the person had dragged her behind a large barrel that reeked of fish. <nl> Not more than a second later, their surroundings lit up as the reflection of flames danced on the building walls, the sound of keening and loud shouting mixing with clopping sounds as the men on horses blazed past. <nl> Her heart pounding in her chest, Luna breathed in large breaths through her nose. <nl> When it finally became silent again, after what seemed like a million seconds ticked by, the person finally let go of her, removing their hand from her mouth. She spit out the taste of grime and dirt, wiping her mouth on her sleeve. Then she whipped around. <nl> And stared at the girl who was probably around her age, or maybe a little older. It was hard to tell because of the dim lighting and because of the grime that covered the girl's face. But there was no mistaking the large, clear eyes, the pigtails, and the cloth dress. <nl> "You must not come out after dark," the girl implored her in the same guttural voice, and for a second, Luna wondered if the girl smoked. Then the girl turned around and began to walk towards the other direction. <nl> "Wait!" Luna walked up and grabbed her hand, feeling the rough calluses on the girl's palm. It felt like the hand of an woman who had lived many, many years. "Where am I? And who are those men? Why did you save me?" The questions spilled out like a waterfall, the sentences running over each other in their haste to escape. <nl> The girl glanced at her with pity in her eyes. "You have lost your home? So have many of us to the Riders." <nl> "No, wait. I haven't...where are we? What year is this?" <nl> The girl gasped. "They have taken your memory too." She reached up with one hand and caressed Luna's face, the roughness of her fingertips strangely calming. "It is the fourteenth hundred and ninety-seventh year of our lord. You are in England." <nl> ***** <nl> EDIT: [Part two](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/986ffe/wp_you_wake_up_in_the_1400s_dark_ages_with/e4e4t11/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=api&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=WritingPrompts) is below! <eos>

<sos> Flames sparked from her fingertips and the top of Neshral's already bright red hair, igniting into a fiery halo. Frantically she beat her hands together, putting out the fire. She and the man jumped at the same time, but Neshral was faster, snatching the glass from the desk. She dumped the water over her head, extinguishing the flames. As the coils of smoke dwindled, her hair returned to its usual shade of scarlet. <nl> "Ha-ha," Neshral giggled, brushing off the incident as she might an accidental belch. "Don't worry about that... seasonal thing, you know? It's just a..." <nl> His expression settled into a glare. Pressing a button on his phone, he shouted, "SECU..." <nl> "Hey!" Neshral protested, flopping over to bat the phone away. It careened across the desk, smacked into the wall, and fell to the ground with a 'thud.' "Didn't you just say I was the most qualified candidate so far, Ramiel?" <nl> "Lord help me. This interview is done." Ramiel edged over, close to where the phone fell, keeping his eyes on Neshral. "And if that screen is so much as chipped..." <nl> "But... but... come on, you have no idea what my student loan bills are like. You think hell ever grants deferments? Ha!" Neshral had dropped to the ground, trying to locate the phone first. <nl> "That's not my problem." Ramiel said, adding, "Sorry." <nl> Hearing the weakness in his tone, Neshral seized on it. "The employee handbook!" she blurted out, even as Ramiel wrapped his hand around the phone. "Page three. Employers do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, ethnicity, sex..." <nl> Ramiel rolled his eyes as he inspected the phone. Undamaged. "Demons are not a protected class." <nl> "It's still discrimination!" <nl> *"I'm not hiring a demon!"* <nl> Neshral straightened up, her arms folded across her chest. "Oh, you better believe I'll report that to HR," she said, glaring at Ramiel. "Actually... maybe I will," she said, as a moment of inspiration struck. <nl> "Excuse me?" <nl> She gestured toward the door. "Everyone else here is human, right? Do they, you know, know? Maybe I could ask... since the interview is over...?" <nl> Ramiel raised an eyebrow, eyeing Neshral in disbelief. "Are you trying to blackmail me into giving you the job?" <nl> "Depends. Do I have the job?" <nl> The door opened before Ramiel could speak. A man in a blue security uniform entered. He glanced between Ramiel and Neshral, then back to Ramiel. "Er... sir? There were shouts on the line. Is everything alright?" <nl> Ramiel and Neshral met each other's gaze at the same instant. For several seconds, they stared at each other. Finally, Ramiel answered, "Everything's fine. Neshral, here, will start Monday at 9." <nl> "Damn right I will!" Neshral agreed, beaming. <nl> Nodding, the guard departed, leaving Neshral and Ramiel alone again. <nl> Ramiel cast another glare at Neshral. "I take my coffee with cream, light sugar. Don't be late." <nl> Neshral skipped to the door. "See you Monday!" <eos>

<sos> Susan Witt held her precious baby boy in her arms, smoothing back the multicolored hair. <nl> "Ma'am, did you hear me?" <nl> Susan cuddled her little boy again, then looked up at the doctor, eyes suddenly focusing almost to pinpoints, expression going rigid. The doctor took a step back, stumbling. <nl> "Like hell he is." <nl> The doctor swallowed. "Parent mortality rates are fairly high in protagonist families ma'am. I recommend you make considerations for such an event." <nl> Susan nodded. "This is about the dark lord to the east right? They say he's going to invade here sometime in the next few years." <nl> The doctor looked away. "Soon yes, according to the king's messengers." <nl> "And my little boy is supposed to stop him, right? People are going to expect that of him. The dark lord will be hunting him, and sooner or later one of them has to die." <nl> "Yes ma'am. That's usually how the condition plays out. There's a possibility your child will end up in a distant land and become a beast tamer or magical card player, but the timing suggests the dark lord to the east. He will be our only hope." <nl> Susan Witt scowled. "Not if I kill this dark lord bastard first." <eos>

<sos> Stepping slowly and lightly, I walked through the house at ease.  Today was not the day to start fights with Rascal or Buddy; today was not the day to jump to High Places and lounge in the warm sun. Despite this, I ran my tail along Buddy's long snout as he slept on the giant cushion bed he'd gotten years ago as a puppy.  He snuffled, and boofed in his sleep, paws still twitching as he chased or played or ran madly in his dreams. Rascal, settled in the slash of sunlight slowly growing on the kitchen floor, lifted his head in surprise as I stepped close, and watched me with pupils wide as I sashayed through the door frame to the living room, then on toward the bedroom.  This was not his day for rulebreaking.  This was mine. <nl> Mama was in bed, soundly asleep beneath several layers of blankets, her breathing slow and deep.  I paced the room, measuring it again and ensuring nothing had changed, then leapt noiseless to the foot of the bed and paused, paws dimpling the duvet. One purposeful step at a time I walked along the very edge of the bed until I got to Mama's shoulder.  I watched her for a moment, then leaned in to rub my cheek along her nose, firm pressure but small gentle strokes. She moved slightly and sighed, so I climbed atop her and curled up on her chest and throat, purring deeply, adding my warmth to her own.  Sunlight slanted in through the open window and warmed the room as minutes ticked by, becoming hours, we two nearly motionless and nearly silent, but close in this very uncharacteristic cuddle. <nl> I never really let on how much I enjoyed those quiet moments; we're not supposed to. That's just one of The Rules. But today was my day to be a rulebreaker, and my only regret was that I would not be able to do this again next year.  The greater the rule broken, the longer the debt must be repaid. <nl> ****************** <nl> Around lunch time, Sarah went to check on her mother, bringing a glass of water and one of broth. The wrinkled old face was at peace in a way that clutched her heart briefly until she heard the soft inhalation of another breath.  Was she smiling?  Perhaps she was having good dreams, wherever she was. <nl> Coming to stand by her old and failing mother, Sarah saw a circle of fabric tucked under her chin.  How had that gotten there?  She recognized it as Caspian's collar, and picked it up, rubbing the tag idly as she looked around in mild confusion.  Her fingers circled over the face with its name etched large, and the back with "1996-2017" etched rather smaller. <nl> Shrugging, Sarah returned the collar to the nightstand where it belonged. <nl> *Edited to correct typos* <eos>

<sos> "Really, after all these years, you finally are willing to listen?" Helena scoffs. Her finger is just centimetres away from ending me. <nl> "Yes," I groan. My ribs hurt like mad. I have no idea how I am supposed to get of this mess I have gotten myself into, but I know I need to try. <nl> Helena chuckles. Hero of the people, that is what she calls herself. How she sees herself. But I know better. She walks up to me and tilts my chin upwards. For the first time in our entire history, I see her grin. <nl> "I suppose it won't hurt," she says, "seeing that you're tied up in your current state." <nl> She pulls up a chair and sits a few steps from me. "You never listened anyway, so maybe this is my only chance." <nl> I breathe a sigh of relief. She took the bait. While my hands explore the lock that she placed them in, I need to keep her distracted. "So, tell me, hero of the people, what do you have to say for yourself?" <nl> Helena is no hero of the people, no matter what she believes. The amount of innocent lives that she took would put even Hitler to shame. She was a terrorist, simple as that. One who is committed to sow chaos and discord. I am the one who have always thwarted her plans, stopping her from achieving her goals. People call me Protector for a reason. <nl> "Have you ever heard of Syria, Mr Protector?" <nl> I nod my head. "It's where you were born, isn't it?" <nl> Interpol has briefed me before on Helena's history. They thought it would help me in my quest to stop her. It did nothing more than wasted a few hours of my life. Never once have those information, obscure as they were, helped me. I never had the time, anyway. All my time were devoted to dealing with Helena's evil plans. <nl> "Correct. But I am sure you know what happened to the country right?" <nl> I stay silent. Syria no longer exists. The place is nothing more than a wasteland now. Helena's gaze pierces mine. There is so much anger and hate burning in her eyes. <nl> "You are a war refugee," I say. One of my fingers manages to slip pass the restraint and I am able to activate my distress signal. My team will know that I am in trouble and send help. I just need to keep Helena busy. <nl> Helena chuckles again. "I see that your masters have taught you well. But have they ever told you about what happened after that?" <nl> From the Interpol files, she was shown to have journeyed to Europe, like so many of her countrymen. From there on, details have been scarce. Interpol had no idea what happened during those few years, but when she re-emerged, her name was tied to a suspected bombing in France. Twenty people died. And people have never stopped dying since then. <nl> "You became a monster," I whisper, which provoke a laugh from Helena. <nl> "A monster?" She shouts. "Is that what your masters told you? That I am a monster? I'll show you what's a monster!" <nl> Another sharp pain pierces through my ribs. I scream in pain as a few more of my bones break. I make the extra effort to spit my blood at Helena. <nl> "Just kill me already," I taunt her. Even if I die, Helena will not be able to escape like how she always does. I have already done my role in locating her. Jonas and the rest will be able to take her in, finally. <nl> Helena shakes her head. She looks at my arm, where a symbol of a shield was tattooed on it. <nl> "I will tell you what happened to me," she says as she lifts her sleeves, revealing an identical tattoo to mine. <nl> "No, it couldn't be," I say out loud. <nl> Helena seems to read my mind. "Yes, Mr Protector. I have the same symbol as you. Maybe the same story as you. Let me guess, you're special, they need you to protect the world and you are destined for a higher calling?" <nl> The sudden realisation hits me harder than Helena's earlier punches. Those were the exact words used when I was recruited. I believed every single one of them. <nl> "You're lying!" I scream. Helena is just toying with me, I tell myself. She is after all, the leader of the most dangerous organisation on the planet. Of course mind games would be up her alley. <nl> "My friends will be here soon and you will have nowhere to escape!" I continue. I will not let her get to me. I am the only one chosen to be the Protector, not her. She must have gotten the info about me, somehow. <nl> Helena smiles at me. "I know that they are coming. My aim here today is just you. Just think about it, will you? Until we meet again." <nl> A loud crash shakes the room and the entire area plunges into darkness. <nl> "Helena?" My voice echoes in the room. She is gone. <nl> -------------------- <nl> Edit: I finished Part 2!

<sos> Edit: To help set the stage... There is an immortal person being pursued by an immortal snail. If the snail catches and touches the person.... <nl> "You know the prophecy woman. " <nl> Forever shall I pursue you. <nl> Forever shall you flee. <nl> If once we meet, then cease to be." <nl> "Eons have passed, yet you can not outrun that which has been foretold. This could have ended long ago. Your fear, my tireless pursuit...ALL in vain because you would not face your destiny. Today, that chapter ends. You are here, backed into this corner and your fortunes are about to change. <nl> Reflect now, upon our journey here. Do you not remember the first ring of salt you left me in? Oh, how it BURNED. HOW I SUFFERED. But I KNEW that one day, this would happen, that I would find you. You have lived lifetime after lifetime. Lived, loved, lost. There was always the loss. How sad it must have been. How gut-wrenching the loss. <nl> All I have ever known though, was the pursuit.  The knowledge that one day, this dance would end. Today... oh TODAY, that ends." <nl> The Snail approached the crouching woman, tears in her eyes. She was losing it. Heaving and pleading.  She was NOT ready for it to end. She curled up into a ball in the corner, as far as she could get, but The Snail drew closer and closer. Closer and Closer. <nl> "No salt today? No pithy comeback or tease? How disappointing..." <nl> The Snail reached out with his nose to touch the heel of her left foot. Smoke overcame the two, swirling and intertwining. <nl> The smoke dissipated.  There, stood a naked man, he appeared to be about twenty years old. He crouched down into the corner over a small object on the floor. It was a snail, lying on its side. <nl> He whispered "Tag...... you're it..." <nl> edit 11/7/18: continued at https://old.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/9un7vs/wp_you_have_a_special_ability_that_lets_you/e96iirf/ <eos>

<sos> Like we arranged, we always met toward the ends of his lives. I was not to intrude, not to disturb him, until he was absolutely bedridden (we'd decided this in one of his earlier reincarnations, when he couldn't stop himself from asking questions about his previous lives, and those memories, frankly, made him insane). <nl> This time around he was a she, an old Filipino lady at the edge of her life, tucked away in a nursing home in America. It was early Fall. The year was 2018. <nl> I was dressed in all black, as usual. Long, black overcoat over a black vest and dress shirt. Black jeans and black dress shoes. As a rule, I changed my race to match hers. So this time around I had smooth brown skin. <nl> When I arrived at her door I didn't bother to knock. We had given up such formalities centuries ago. <nl> She was dressed in all white, and was thin, delicate, sitting on a chair by the window. <nl> "Who's there?" She asked, turning her head. <nl> I hovered at the doorway and smiled my smile while she squinted her eyes and inspected me. Slowly I could see her remembrance of me returning to her, like color in someone's cheeks when they return inside after a winter day. <nl> "It's me." I said. <nl> "Oh." She turned her gaze back to the window. "That time already, huh?" <nl> I entered and took a seat on her neatly-made bed. <nl> "So, how'd I do?" She asked. <nl> "This time around?" <nl> "Yeah, how'd I do?" <nl> I hesitated. <nl> "You haven't asked in a long time. You sure you want to know?" <nl> "I'm tired." She looked me in the eye. "It's rough. Has it always been this rough around the end? Of course, there were good times. But just..." And she thought about it, then turned back to the window. "I don' think I could do it again. I just don't think I can, you know?" <nl> "That's alright." I felt sorry for her. There *were* bad times, horrible, messy, unspeakable times. I mean, she's lived through most of human history. But bad times always passed. Or she always wondered at what was next." <nl> "I mean it. I think I'm done." <nl> "Why the change of heart?" <nl> "I've had many hearts. Seeing you again reminds me of that. I didn't even know why I was so sad until you walked through that door. Until then, it was like a cold mist. Something fogging the windows, freezing me up inside. But now I know. <nl> "I'm sick. I don't just mean the cancer." She turned her body towards me now and grabbed my hand. "Don't you get tired of seeing it all pass by? Like a pool of water bound to evaporate? Souls waiting in the clouds, a life as fast as falling rain?" <nl> "I don't get it." I said. "You've been through millenniums? Why only now?" <nl> She squeezed my hand, and the lines in her smile deepened. "I'm sorry. I haven't been explaining myself well." And her lips started to quiver. "I cant see you anymore and I cant come back. You carry the weight of my past lives and all my past losses and past loves and everything in the shadows of your black coat. Somehow, even when I'm born, I know that you're bound to come, and that burden of memories looms over my life and affects every grain of my existence, even if for all those years I cant explain why I feel that way. <nl> "I'm done reincarnating. And I know that you are inevitably connected to that process, so I guess this will be my last time seeing you, too." <nl> Then, something I'm not used to. Something that had been missing for longer than history. An emptiness gathering inside me. <nl> "I'm sorry" she said again. "We've had so many good times. And I've learned so much by looking back with you. But I'm done looking." <nl> "No," I said. "I understand." <nl> She burst into a fit of coughing, and I helped her into bed. <nl> "Can I ask you something? Why do you choose to visit me?" <nl> "I needed a friend." I said. <nl> She chuckled. <nl> "We met once. A long time ago. And we became friends. It was something I hadn't expected either. I was just doing my job." <nl> "I hope you will make more friends." She said, quietly. <nl> She was starting to doze off, and I sat by and just watched her. <nl> Then, "Can I ask one more thing?" <nl> "Yes." <nl> "Are you Death?" <nl> She looked at me and we both smiled. <nl> Then she closed her eyes and slept. <nl> And she never woke up again. <eos>

<sos> The words echoed fruitlessly in her head as her grip around her rifle grew ever tighter. It sat perched atop a tower of steel and wires, massive clawed feet contorting metal bars as if they were made of paper. It hadn't seen her yet, or so she hoped, but she knew that any sudden movements could easily change that for the worse. <nl> Sweat ran across her forehead and into her eyes as she tried her hardest not to reach up and wipe them off. Instead, eyes fixed on enormous wings that flexed slightly with the wind, she forced her legs to move. It was not slowly enough. The minute she shifted her feet the angel spun it's avian head around and stared directly at her with sharp. brilliantly golden eyes. <nl> She ran even before the fear gripped her like a vice and the horrible shriek of the angel rang out across the ruins. She was in an alley before she even realized what happened, running past fallen debris and upturned concrete like she had been born to do so. <nl> A shadow suddenly blocked out the sun, and without thinking, she whirled around and fired her rifle up against the beaked monstrosity that tried its hardest to squeeze down into the narrow alleyway. It was a futile gesture, but even as the bullet reached its destination to no apparent effect, that simple act of resistance made her feel just a little bit better. That feeling proved shortlived. <nl> The angel broke past a myriad of metal staircases as it desperately tried to force its massive wingspan into the comparatively narrow gap. Huge clawed hands grasped for her as she ran, and she knew she only managed to stay out of their reach because of the terrain advantage. And there was no way for her to keep that advantage for long. <nl> "Over here," Came the faint call of a young girl as she sprinted past an open door. Cursing herself for not noticing earlier, and with the angel hot on her heels, she took a hard left as soon as she could. She would have to circle back. That was not a very appealing notion, especially considering the fact that she didn't just imagine the voice. Or worse yet that it was an angelic trick. <nl> The angel roared loudly behind her at the sudden turn, but she knew the extra width would only worsen her situation once it recovered. And so, even though her lungs burned like fire and her legs ached like never before, she forced herself to run faster. Her only advantage came when taking corners, so it was imperative that she ran quicker on the stretches in between. <nl> But she wouldn't be faster than an angel, and as she took the first corner she could hear the massive beast crash into a building on the opposite side of the road less than a second after. It shrieked again and she focused on the fact that there were only two corners left. However, this first one was on a large street, which meant the angel could once more utilize its wings. She had to be faster. <nl> The buildings that made up the alley nearly collapsed seconds after she darted into it, the massive form of an angel flying full speed into the opening and not quite fitting through. She stumbled and almost fell as the impact rocked the very foundation of the street, her legs close to giving up. One more corner. <nl> For the last one, she was well ahead, though that meant only a second or two to a being such as that. A second or two that she desperately needed if she wanted to cling to the small hope of it not seeing her enter the building. It would be close, but as she ran toward the door with blurry vision, certain that at any point a massive hand would grab her up into the sky, she was pulled in by the collar by a different hand. <nl> It was dark in the room, and as soon as she was inside the hand let go of her and the door closed behind her. All noise disappeared, including that of the angel she had no doubt was still out there, rampaging through the streets. There was only silence, darkness, and a faint scent of pepper in the air. <nl> All of the sudden the room was lit, all over, at the same time, and it was all she could do not to recoil in terror. Ahead of her sat a humanoid creature at least three times her size, it's color a constant mix between orange and red. On it's back sat a pair of wings, but in stark contrast to the avian features of an angel, these wings were clearly those of an insect like a butterfly or moth. <nl> It's strangely thin and frail body was protected in large part by a thin carapace that accented its features but did not obscure them. Four thin arms that ended in hands akin to those of men, yet pointy and sharp at the tips, seemed to fidget occasionally as it observed her in turn. The head was most peculiar, however, for it was almost identical to that of a human, save for the helmet-like horn that covered anything above the forehead. <nl> It uttered an almost musical noise all of the sudden, and she reached for her rifle before recognizing the sound as melodious laughter. It smiled at her before standing up on two thin legs far too long for its body and leaned in to speak with her. <nl> "Truly, you little ones never seem to learn," It said, in a very distinctively feminine voice, which, after having seen its face, further solidified the fact that the *it* was, in fact, a *she*. "Again and again, you climb out of the sewers, as if you wish for nothing more than to be hunted." <nl> "T-Thank you for saving me," She said with an attempt to steel her voice, fighting back every instinct in her body telling her to run, "Now please don't eat me," <nl> "Eat you?" The demon asked, bursting out into laughter, all four arms gripping its stomach, "No, I won't eat you, little girl," <nl> "Then what do you want?" She asked, gripping her rifle as tightly as possible in an attempt to release the panic that sought to overwhelm her. <nl> "I want what we always want, and what you're always willing to give," The demon said, moving closer and gripping her tightly by the arms to look right into her eyes. "I only ask, for a *favor*," <eos>

<sos> The ship whizzed towards the edge of the solar system, *One small step for man...* Captain Miranda Logan thought to herself. *Hope it's more fun outside the solar system then the last 3 years have been traveling to the bloody edge of it* <nl> Alarms started to beep. Her crew began to panic and readouts on the computers made to sense. <nl> A crowd had formed near the starboard viewing deck. One man fainted. Lieutenant Adam Price and sergeant Jessica Trenance, usually stubbornly resistant to any form of superstition fell to their knees and started *Worshiping?!* <nl> "What the fuck... what in God's name are you tossers doing?" <nl> "Don't speak his name in vain!" <nl> She pushed past the illogical crowd. And stopped dead. <nl> "What..." <nl> A giant hole had opened up and a big head was looking through it as if it was a window. <nl> "Uh, hi... I take it your the captain..." <nl> "Yes" <nl> "I'm Steve, I'm the doorman. Didn't you read the dress code before you left? you're gonna have to turn back, unless you have a change of clothes on you" <nl> *A change of clothes... hmm* <nl> "What do we need?" Asked Miranda. <nl> "Brown brogues, a grey suit and top hat" replies Steve. <nl> *Bingo!* she thought to herself. "I'll just go get changed". <nl> It just happened that only she had the right clothes in her cabins locker. Off she ran. <nl> 10 mins later, she returned and every one was in a religious fever. Praying. Chanting. Performing off ceremonies. <nl> "Oi, Steve. I'm here." <nl> "Perfect, let me just beam you over" <nl> Her body tingled. Before she knew it she was standing next to Steve. Only a few inches taller than her. He was still looking out of the hole which happened to be a window in a door with a sliding shutter. <nl> "Looking good" he said. <nl> "Thanks." <nl> She peeped out of the window and saw her ship. The size of a shoe. She could see her crew. Zealous faces pressed to the window. <nl> "Ok, Miranda... welcome to club heaven. Jesus is on the decks tonight, Buddha is working the bar and Mohammad is helping with the mocktails... Have fun" <eos>

<sos> The genie glared at the stick in front of it. The dog pawed it closer to him, wagging her tail with enthusiasm. <nl> "You have three wishes, dog," the genie said, his arms crossed, "but that does not make me your plaything. Please hurry this along, so I can once more go back to my slumber." <nl> "Bark!" the dog said, gazing at the genie with its bright blue eyes. <nl> "You would waste a wish on that? So be it. I shall throw the stick." <nl> The genie threw the stick far into the distance, and the dog immediately stumbled off to fetch it. The genie sighed, waiting for the dog to return. <nl> It came back with the stick in her mouth, looking immensely proud of herself. She put the stick in front of the genie again, moving slightly into the distance, readying herself to fetch it once more. <nl> "You only wished for one throw, dog," the genie said. "Please do not waste any more of my time." <nl> "Bark!" the dog replied. <nl> "No, you cannot wish for the same thing twice. You have already wasted one wish; do not waste them further. Think about what you truly want. It can be selfish, grandiose or otherworldly - it can be absolutely anything you want," the genie said, glancing at the dog's leg. <nl> The dog seemed to hesitate, then came right up to the genie. She rolled over, exposing her belly. <nl> "A belly rub? You would waste another wish on a *belly rub*?" <nl> The dog nodded, wagging its tail rapidly. <nl> "So be it, foolish creature," the genie said, lowering himself to pet the dog, "you shall get your belly rub." <nl> The genie rubbed the dog's belly for perhaps longer than he intended to. The creature was stupid, of that there was no doubt. But that didn't make it *bad*. <nl> "Now, dog. You only have one wish left. Do not think of a game of fetch, nor a belly rub. Think about what you want more than anything in the world. Whatever it is, I shall grant you it... and then take leave of you." <nl> The dog stopped wagging its tail, slowly getting back onto her three legs. It seemed to think long and hard. Eventually, it came to a decision. <nl> "Bark," the dog said. <nl> "You want your master to be happy? Dog, you do not have to worry about your master. You can wish for anything you want. Anything at all." <nl> The dog shook its head. "Bark," it repeated with conviction. <nl> "Well, if that is what you wish. Then tell me - where is your master?" <nl> The dog stared at the genie. She sat down in front of him, moving her nose towards him, as if to point. <nl> "You mean... you mean to say that *I* am your master?" <nl> The dog jumped up, fetching her stick once more and placing it in front of the genie. <nl> The genie looked at the dog, then the stick. He seemed to consider something. <nl> "Very well, dog," he said, picking up the stick with care. <nl> "Though I did not do a thing - your wish has been granted." <nl> ***** <nl> ***** <nl> If you didn't completely hate that, consider subscribing to [my subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/) <nl> I'll try add new (and old) stories every day <3 <eos>

<sos> We like to think we're "civilized." That we don't revel in the pain of our enemies, that we don't wish the most horrible of fates in those who would hurt us and ours. It's a truth that makes us uncomfortable, that inside each one of us sleeps a beast that would rip apart anyone, *anyone* who dared cross a line. The line is different for everyone. For a mother it may be harming her child, for a patriot it may be invading his country, for a miser it may be taking his money. <nl> We can pretend all we want, it changes nothing. There is a monster inside all of us, and for many of us, it came out with betrayal of Dr. Karen Williams. <nl> She stood in front of the prison, flanked by armed guards. She'd go inside the squat building behind her which contained the best doctors the world had to offer. They would work very, very hard to keep her alive for as long as they could. She would be tortured every day until she died. It would be a televised event. All proceeds would go to the effort to counter her heinous crime. <nl> But now she stood, and, through some strange consensus, although no one had decided upon this, she spoke to the crowd of millions that had gathered to watch her go in, and the crowd, the world, had known she would. <nl> "You hate me," she said, "her voice being played on millions of screens. "You think I have-" <nl> "Shut the fuck up!" Someone said <nl> "Someone just shoot that bitch," another voice called out, both were immediately silenced. <nl> Dr. Karen continued as if nothing had happened. "You think I have betrayed you, that I am some twisted, insane maniac who thinks the human race doesn't deserve to continue. That the world would be better off without us." <nl> The world held its breath. Everyone had thought her one of those maniacs. A few idiots had praised her, saying it was the right thing to do, before their neighbors had ripped them apart. <nl> "This could not be further from the truth," she said. "I have committed a grave crime, I admit. If there is a hell, I will spend an eternity in it after being inflicted with whatever agony you can imagine, but years later, when the anger has faded and the objectivity kicks in, you'll thank me." <nl> "We'll all be dead in a few years you bitch!" A voice called, and this time a small chorus echoed its sentiment before being silenced. <nl> She smiled. As she was about to die in the worst way in history she smiled. "Humans will be united. For the first time in history, almost every mind in the world will be united to achieve something. Infertility? Please, you'll solve it in a few years," she scoffed. "But once you have a taste of this cooperation, you'll do it again. Not immediately perhaps, or not fully, but you'll see what a united humanity can do and you'll do it again. And again. And again. I have ushered in a new golden age. You may not see it now, your children might not, nor their children. But someone down the line will. I'm sure of it." <nl> Dead silence greeted her. <nl> The guards escorted her inside the building without ceremony. She was screaming and crying hours later. <nl> *** <nl> **An excerpt from *History: A Human Perspective*, (c) December 2267** <nl> *The infertility crisis as it is known, is somewhat of a misnomer. It is what caused the birth of the United Science League, and gave the United Nations sweeping powers to control research funding. Within a decade a cure to the vaccine was found, but these organizations persisted. Within half a century we had a colony on the moon, had terraformed Mars, and a century later we had mastered interstellar travel. Sociologists predicted that such progress, such a united front, might have taken a 1000 years to occur and at the cost of some war or the other. The world agrees, perhaps a bit grudgingly, that Dr. Karen Williams is perhaps the single most vital catalyst in human history. A hero, some might say.* <nl> *** <nl> (minor edits) <nl> If you enjoyed, check out my sub, [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/) <eos>

<sos> The official launch of the Quantum State Computer was not for another week, but that did not stop Dr Latimer Jordan from his usual antics. <nl> "Hey, Quam," he said, as he kicked his feet up on the console-top. "I've got a real mind-bender for you this time." <nl> "Oh stop it," I replied. "You're wasting precious processing power with your silly questions. We've already run through the checklists a hundred times. Quam is *perfect*. The government will prove that on a stage in front of the entire world. With Quam on our side, we will be the *only* superpower in the world -" <nl> "Dr Malvo, where's your sense of curiosity? Of course Quam did well in the tests - the questions we put to her all had definite answers! To really see if she's worth the gold and platinum in her circuits, we've got to ask her a real out-of-the-box question!" <nl> That much was true. Though the questions we had prepared for Quam were *infinitely* difficult and completely beyond the reach of any other contemporary super computers - creating an algorithm a dozen times more complex than any cryptocurrency's and then solving it completely, predicting how the world economy would shift in the next two weeks, even simulating the asteroid belt collisions a full light-year away - the answers were still concrete, definite. We knew those answers because we had solved for them, that's how we knew Quam worked. <nl> Quam was just really, really, *really* powerful. <nl> But just how powerful was she? <nl> "What are you trying to achieve, Latimer?" <nl> "Consider this," he said, as he folded his arms and smiled that patented Cheshire-smile of his. "Quam pulls data from every single digital source known to man. Then she *cross-references* it with her databases *from the future*. In a single second, she trawls the entirety of the multiverse to look for her answer. She's not just *one*, she's a dozen, thousand, *million* Quams, all at the same time. We're wasting her abilities with the stupid, mundane queries we're putting to her." <nl> "Developing a cure for cancer isn't stupid." <nl> "You're right, you're right. But what I'm saying is, I want to ask her something... different. Just to see how she handles it. You've got to admit, it'll be real cool for her to say 'error' or 'answer not available'. The first non-answer, from the one computer that has an answer for *everything*." <nl> I sighed, then fished the security token out from my lab-coat. This exchange would not come cheap - Quam's operating cost was approximately fifty thousand dollars per question on average - but I supposed that there was no harm to what Latimer was proposing. <nl> Live a little, right? <nl> "Go ahead then. Let's see what you've got." <nl> Latimer beamed as the monitor screens flashed green - Quam was ready for input. He cleared his throat, then said, "Consider this, Quam. Medication has been developed that promises functional immortality for humankind. Everyone who takes it appears to gain superhuman regenerative powers, and they cannot be killed unless they are dissolved at the atomic level. Governments around the world work to get the medication into the hands of as many people as possible, oblivious to the side-effect of infertility. After all, why would there be need for more humans if we cannot die?" <nl> "This... is what you wanted to ask?" I said. <nl> "*Shh*. Anyway, Quam, the problem presents itself in less than 50 years. The truth is made known - the medication is a hoax. People may be in tip-top physical condition, but they still keel over and die when their time is up. The medication does grant one powers of regeneration, and also robs one of fertility, but there is no immortality to speak of." <nl> Quam flashed as she took in the question. Her voice, designed in the likeness of one of the most sultry actresses of our era, poured out of the speakers in silky waves. "And what is your question, Dr Jordan?" <nl> "Well, the question is simple - what would you do to fix that? How would you stop the human race from effectively neutering itself, and dooming itself to die out within a single generation?" <nl> Quam hummed as her processers kicked in. I felt the hair rise on my skin as she engaged her quantum motors - the lights overhead flicked as Quam drank in every watt of power we made available to her. <nl> Then, her voice issued again, though... there was the strangest hint of urgency underlying her words. <nl> "I have an answer. Please pay attention." <nl> Latimer swung his feet down, and he leaned forward to begin jabbing at the controls. "Strange," he said, as the frown spread across his face. "That was a completely nonsensical query. Quam should not have been able to answer that. She should have just said 'error', or 'answer not -'" <nl> Quam whirred again as she continued with her answer. The blood drained from my face, and I became aware that sweat was pooling in my palms. <nl> "I would send a warning back in time. Time travel for physical entities is not possible, so electronic signals are the next best thing. I would plant the germ of the conundrum in the mind of a scientist who has access to quantum computing, prompting him to test the limits of his creation by asking that very question. The scenario you have described is the *modus operandi*, or the preferred, signature method, of those who come from afar. They prefer non-violent means to rid planets of their current hosts, so they hide amongst the shadows and coax the species towards terminating themselves. Then, when the planet lies silent and undefended, they move in and takeover, seamlessly." <nl> I exchanged a look with Latimer. His face had gone white too, and his lips were shaking as he tried to regain some measure of composure. <nl> "Quam?" I asked. "Who are they? And... how much time do we have?" <nl> "Their real name is not pronounceable by humans, but humans soon took to calling them the 'Colaxo'. And I am happy to report that you have twenty years from today, give or take a week or two, before their first agents land on earth." <nl> Quam's screen flashed green, indicating that her answer was complete. <nl> "Is there any other query I can help you with, gentlemen?" <nl> --- <nl> /r/rarelyfunny <eos>

<sos> "So, whatcha doing down there Bun-bun?" Belle's dad called out from atop the stairwell leading down to the basement. <nl> "I'm making a POWER POTION!" Belle called back, raising her fist above her head in exultation. She giggled and then went back to pouring random amounts of soap and water into a small bottle in front of her. <nl> "Oh wow, that sounds exciting, can I see?" Her dad clomped down the stairs behind her, the dull thud echoing in the small basement that had been repurposed as a play space for Belle once she got old enough to handle the stairs on her own. <nl> Belle quickly turned to face her dad, splaying her arms out in front of her, "Nuh-uh. It's a secret recipe. I'm gonna make a billion zillion dollars with it!" <nl> Her dad got up on his tippie-toes, trying to sneak a peek behind his five year old daughter. "Can't I be your assistant? I am very good at mixing up potion stuff." <nl> Belle crossed her arms and jutted her chin out. "No. It's a secret." <nl> "Even from me?" <nl> "Especially you!" She crinkled her nose up and gave him a squint. "You do business stuff. I don't need a business stuff person yet." <nl> "Okay, okay, okay. But I get a share of the profits." <nl> "Why?" <nl> "Because I put a roof over your head. I'm incubating this potion startup." <nl> "Ink cube baiting?" Belle tiled her head to the side, trying the word out. <nl> "Yes. It's like when a mama chicken sits on an egg until it hatches." <nl> "You're the mama chicken?" <nl> "Yes. Something like that." <nl> Belle giggled, finding this revelation very amusing. "Ok, chicken!" She waved her little hand, "But now I need to get back to work. RIGHT. NOW. This is a very important part." She turned back to the little kitchenette that held the variety of liquids. <nl> "All right Bun-bun, just bring your potion upstairs when you're done," her dad said before turning and clomping back up the stairs. <nl> Belle turned back to her little workspace, humming a little tune to herself. She poured some pink stuff she had gotten from her mom's cabinet into some orangey-yellowy stuff she had found in the garage. <nl> "Let it go! LET IT GOOOOOOOOOOO!" <nl> Pour. Mix. Stir. <nl> "The cold doesn't bother me any way!" <nl> Pour pour. Mix. Shake. <nl> Finally, the Power Potion(tm) was complete. It looked really weird, all swirly and bubbly. It even had little fizzy sounds popping around it. That made sense to Belle though. What else was supposed to happen when you combined EVERY SINGLE LIQUID into one potion bottle? <nl> That's what made it so powerful. It had lots of stuff in it. <nl> And she had shaken it extra super hard. <nl> That was a big secret too. <nl> Probably the biggest secret. <nl> Maybe the second biggest. The super secret she had mixed in was really the secret secret part. <nl> "Dad! I'm ready!" She called out as she carefully carried the potion up the stairs. It was very hard to not fall when she was wearing her princess outfit, but the princess outfit was also a secret part of the potion. It gave her magic. <nl> Ice magic. <nl> Like Elsa. <nl> She carefully navigated her way up the stairs, the Power Potion(tm) held out in front of her. Step by step she inched over to the kitchen table until she set the bottle down on the edge. Her dad was making meatballs over in the kitchen, but looked over at her when she came in. "Done already?" <nl> Belle nodded vigorously. "Yes. I have been working on it like for days and days." <nl> "Oh my, that does sound like quite the process. Well, let's see what you have there Inventor Belle." <nl> "Science Inventor Princess Belle," she replied. It was very important that her various roles in the creation of the potion were explicitly understood. <nl> Her dad came over and took a seat by the potion. "So, this is the Power Potion huh?" <nl> "Yeah!" <nl> "How did you get it to bubble?" He asked. <nl> "Secret." She raised a finger to her lips, exposing her wrist, "Shhhhhhh...." <nl> Her dad's eyes slid down to her wrist and then widened, "Bun-bun, is there something wrong with your number?" <nl> Belle looked at him, confused, "Huh?" <nl> "Your threat number," he reached out and pulled the sleeve of her gown further back. A long number faintly printed onto the surface snaked up her arm, covering most of her forearm. "Was it like this earlier?" <nl> "Nuh-uh. It was normal when I put on my Elsa dress before I made the potion." Her normal number was a one. Sometimes a two when she was being particularly difficult. One time it was a three when she was screaming while mama was trying to drive in traffic. <nl> "So, it just changed?" <nl> Belle nodded vigorously. <nl> "Did you do anything different?" <nl> She shrugged, "I made a Power Potion." <nl> Her dad glanced at her and then rolled up his shirtsleeve. It showed an eight, just like normal. Frowning, he reached out. The second his fingers touched the potion, the number bloomed on his wrist, expanding until it covered his forearm as well. <nl> His mouth went dry and he let go of the potion. "Bun-bun. What did you put in there? It's very important." <nl> Belle could tell that her dad was using his serious voice. Suddenly nervous, she leaned forward, her voice dropping to a whisper, giving voice to the super secret ingredient, "Oreos." <nl> **Platypus out.** <nl> **Want MOAR platypus?** r/PerilousPlatypus <nl> &#x200B; <eos>

<sos> If, when I first walked onto this archery range, you had asked me to pick one person that would take this joke seriously, it would be the man standing before me right now.  He was a bit taller than anyone else there, long and rangy and looking every bit the sort of guy who picked up archery the moment he saw *Lord of the Rings*. <nl> "Finally," he said, pushing several strands of messy blonde hair from his face and tucking it behind his ears.  "I'm in.  Have you secured a mage yet?" <nl> "Uh..." I droned as I debated whether or not to keep the joke going.  "I...no, I haven't.  Do you know any?" <nl> The archer chuckled, slinging his bow over his shoulder.  "Of course I do,, though it has been a long while since I saw her last.  Let's go, I know where she should be."  Without waiting for my agreement, he set off with long, surprisingly graceful strides toward the edge of the range. <nl> I briefly considered just having a laugh and being on my way, but his absolute commitment to playing along had my curiosity piqued.  I managed with some effort to keep up with his effortless speed until we reached the edge of the forest. <nl> "What...what is your name, archer?" I asked, somewhat winded from the exertion. <nl> "Dan," he responded, chuckling as soon as he said it.  "Forgive me, I've grown so used to abbreviating it since I arrived here."  Dan stopped abruptly, turning to face me with his hand extended.  "I am Danillion, second scion of House Errin." <nl> *Great,* I thought to myself.  *I had go find myself a LARPer.* <nl> I extended my hand to take his, searching my mind for an equally fantasy-appropriate name to offer him in response.  "A pleasure, Danillion.  I am Kerwyn of the Anteguard." <nl> It was the first thing that came to mind, ridiculous as it sounded.  And yet...the moment I said it, I felt a tremor in my gut, as if I were about to be sick.  The feeling passed, replaced with a deep and resonant feeling of...of truth. <nl> I looked up into Dan's eyes, and saw him regarding me with a mix of curiosity and surprise.  "Well met, Kerwyn.  I somehow always expected you would be taller." <nl> Dan...Danillion...resumed his walk through the forest, readily making his way through trees and underbrush as easily as most would across a manicured lawn.  My head spun, but even as I tried to reconcile the conflict between the me I knew and this...Kerwyn...I knew to follow Danillion's footsteps precisely. <nl> We walked for quite a while before I finally collected my thoughts.  "So wait, where are..." <nl> My words trailed off as we entered a clearing, and I laid my eyes upon a small cottage completely out of place in the modern city where I lived. <nl> "Here," Danillion replied with a winning smile.  "Let me do the talking at first.  She is a bit...irritable, shall we say.  Still, I know her to be a reliable wielder of the Eldritch arts, and almost certainly game for an adventure." <nl> It was all I could do to nod and follow, too many thoughts racing through my mind to manage to focus on any one of them.  A moment later, Danillion pounded on the door of the oddly placed shack. <nl> The muffled voice of a woman came through the doorway, and immediately my head began to ring.  A tempest of emotions swirled around inside me, elation and guilt and anger, along with others for which I had no name. <nl> "...in the hell do you wa..." the woman's voice blurted, gaining clarity as the door swung open. <nl> ...and there she was.  Exactly as I remembered her, though I could not recall having ever seen her before in my life.  She was every bit as beautiful as always...whenever always was. <nl> "K-Kerwyn?" she said, her voice breaking.  "Where have you...how...?"  She turned to face Danillion, confusion writ large across her face.  "Where did you...?" <nl> *At least she is almost as confused as I am.* <nl> I started to try to explain as best I could, but the mere act of searching for words opened a floodgate.  Memories I could not quite capture danced at the edge of my awareness.  Emotions I knew were genuine, but for which I could not find any cause.  I fought it briefly, hoping to keep hold on what I *thought* was sanity, before giving in to it all. <nl> All of the emotions surged to the surface at once, and I fell to my knees in front of the mage Danillion brought me to meet.  Words began to pour out of my mouth unbidden, most of which I forgot the moment that I spoke them.  The first words to come, however, I would never forget for the rest of my days. <nl> "Mallory, my love.  Please...forgive me." <nl> * * * <nl> EDIT for a pronoun fix.  Changed ideas mid-stream. <nl> EDIT 2 (which was in itself edited):  **Parts 2 and 3** have been added sequentially below, by request.  So long as there is any buzz, I will try to keep adding more... <nl> **FINAL EDIT HERE**:  Wow, wow...Thank you all so incredibly much for the response to this!  I can hardly believe it.  I plan to continue this story with some regular writing, and as suggested by some, I have started a subreddit to keep future updates both contained and easily found.

<sos> It's 3:00 AM. My eyes are red, slight hint of dryness. <nl> I have been playing games on one screen and keeping a news tab open on another. Skyrim. I play it because I can always pause it at will and continue later. I also play it because I can get swallowed in it. Either get a new mod, look up what's causing issues on why the start-up doesn't work, cleaning the mods. <nl> It's a time sink. And I need time to go as fast as possible so Chloe can get home and can explain to me *what the fuck that was*. <nl> At one moment we're watching one of her soap operas and the clothes are coming off, and the next she jumps up, runs into her room, runs out wearing fucking Paladin armor, including a shining sword and *wings* to boot, tells me she'll explain later and *flies out the window*. Like a fucking bird. <nl> At first I had to check whether or not I got drugged or was in a dream or some shit. I knew this place was like a melting pot of heroes and villains due to some biological disaster twenty years ago that turned people into...I dunno, doctors say that whoever survived was 'more than human'. The philosophical aspect aside, I didn't give a shit. <nl> But now it turns out I've been dating one for a year without noticing. At first, when I realized that this wasn't an acid trip, I wondered if I was retarded. How the fuck could I miss a pair of wings on her back? But she had no scars or anything else on her back. A perfectly human, lovely back that I rubbed every day she got home. <nl> How about her getaways? Sure she blew off a date or two, maybe three, but shit happens, you know? Her dad's been in poor health. I met the guy, spends most of the day in bed, hooked up to oxygen tanks due to COPD. Was that an actor? What else did she hide from me? Was the woman I knew really even her? <nl> The door opened and closed. Yep, it was her. Still in that suit of hers. I checked the newsfeed quickly. It said that some 'villain' named Berserker had been beaten by a 'heroine' named Archangel, with Berserker having been taken into custody. Details are coming out, six people dead, forty wounded. <nl> In her right hand, she carried a bag. I could smell it was Chinese. I pouted, knowing she was using my emotional weakness of large batches of Chinese against me. She took her helmet off. Her hair had been squashed under it's weight. Her eyes were red too, but of tears I think. Avoiding my eyes and caught in a thousand yard stare, she murmured an apology, dropped the bag on the table and went into her room, locking the door behind her. <nl> Oh, hell no. I get up and knock on the door. <nl> "Gimme a minute Jay, I'll be right there. I know you want to talk." <nl> "Are you okay?" <nl> "I'm fine, Jay. I'll be right there." <nl> "You don't look okay." <nl> "I said I'm fine." <nl> "Let me help." <nl> "Don't worry, just let me...Just give me a minute. I need a minute. Just start without me. Please?" <nl> I didn't. I sat down at the table and waited. She was hurting. This stuff meant a lot to her. She wasn't exactly the epitome of generosity, to be honest. She didn't do charity work or volunteering at the local shelters, didn't donate a lot of money to animals in need. She was Chloe. A *very* good looking women who had given up on dating by the time I met her, going around in sleazy sweater and jeans, walking around campus wearing a bun, not really giving too much of a shit about personal hygiene and the latest fashion. <nl> After a couple of minutes, she came out. She wore a t-shirt and a baggy set of sweatpants and wearing two pairs of socks. Chronic cold feet, she said. Without saying a word, she sit down and start unpacking the boxes of food. <nl> Orderly placing them next to one another, the vegetarian dishes on her side and the spicy meat, babi pangang with bami goring on my side. She'd cleaned her make-up off her face. Was she afraid of it running out? <nl> "So." I start. She looks at me, then takes a dish and starts mulching on it. <nl> I take mine, twirl it on a set of chopsticks. The tension between us rises as she continues to ignore me while I'm just trying to catch her eye. <nl> "So..." <nl> "So what?" She asks rather sullen. <nl> "I am a rockstar." <nl> She looks up to me trivially. <nl> "I've got my rock moves." <nl> Her face blanks. <nl> "But I definitely need you tonight." <nl> She rolls her eyes so far back into her skull I almost thought for a second she got a seizure. She facepalms, I catch a grin in there somewhere. <nl> "Really? Music puns?" <nl> "As long as I can get a smile outta you, sure." <nl> We sit there silently, mulching away until we're done. She speaks up first. <nl> "I'm sorry I lied to you." <nl> I don't say anything. My turn to stare. <nl> "I know you have questions. I didn't want you to get involved in this. You're my...my *guy*, you know." <nl> "Mmmm, no. I don't know." <nl> "You know how people go home at the end of the day to people they have been completely disconnected from, like...worlds apart? How, like, your work life and personal life are split? You're my personal life. You're my guy I want to come home to every day." <nl> I, first the very first time of my life, have no clue what to say. <nl> "No matter how good or bad the day goes,....I can always count on you. To be there for me. No matter what. I love you. And I *lied* to you all this time..." <nl> She quietly started sobbing. <nl> "I am....I am *so* sorry. I am so sorry I didn't tell you. I...I didn't want this to happen, but...I have no good excuses. I was scared. Scared you'd reject me. That you'd be afraid, that you'd tell someone. That I'd lose you. I didn't want to risk that. So I didn't tell you. I'm sorry." <nl> I knew I didn't have to say anything. I stood up, pulled her from her chair and hugged her. She cried on my chest. I could feel her tears. But that's okay. That doesn't matter. <nl> We stood there, holding each other for a long time. I didn't bother checking the clock. I finally knew what to say. <nl> "I love you too." <eos>

<sos> So this was it. Death. Kicking the bucket. Buying the farm. A thousand and one metaphors for the simple fact her heart was no longer beating. <nl> It was sudden, and then suddenly it wasn't anything at all. Sarah wasn't even sure how it happened. Not that it mattered. <nl> The afterlife was an ambient gray; almost like a faint mist hanging in the absence of air. Through that mist, she could see shadows. Not alarming or predatory-- though a part of her wondered if such things were even possible here-- but calm and wandering. She felt she knew them all, intimately. <nl> This one was Johanne, a young German boy whose mother occasionally cried out his name in the midst of night terrors and alcohol-fueled sobs, even now, twenty years later. <nl> This one was Susan, an older woman who hadn't been here long, and likely wouldn't be here much longer. "I'm waiting for a friend." her voice whispered. <nl> And then there were the older ones. Mr. Jay, who was important enough in his life that those passionate about history still spoke his name. "I won't be much longer," he seemed to whisper, "Soon, my legacy will be forgotten. I can feel it." <nl> Sarah could feel it, too. She would be here for some time, but it wouldn't even be eighty years before she moved on. Almost detached from her own life, she vaguely wondered if there was more she could have done, but decided it wasn't worth consideration. <nl> It wasn't so bad as she'd feared in life. Even the mystery of where she goes next had lost all of its urgency and alarm. <nl> And then there were the oldest ones. Whose names were still spoken, even now, and who Sarah could feel would be here for much longer. Romulus, Beethoven, Saigo... souls marked not by how long they'd been here, but by how long they had before moving on. <nl> "Nothing is permanent," one whispered. "Even we will be forgotten." <eos>

<sos> Alice stormed into her room, slamming the door behind her. It was one of those days where the whole world seemed rigged against her, where the myriad travails of high school life just became too much to bear, where her only friend in the world seemed to be Froggy, in his tank. Froggy, who had lived for far longer than her mother had said he would, who had never let her down and had become her only rock in a world of pubescent chaos... A sudden jolt of love overcoming her natural disgust, Alice's lips touched the amphibian's moist body, only to find themselves opposite the lips of a rather portly Egyptian. <nl> "Congratulations!" He proclaimed, as Alice's body propelled itself across the room in shock. "For in giving honor to this humble frog, you have shown yourself to be worthy of the grace of great Heqet herself! Now name your reward, and such as I can grant shall be yours!" <nl> There was a pause as the man looked at Alice expectantly, before she babbled "Who in the what of I are you?" <nl> "Me? I am but a lowly priest, offered to the fertility goddess Heqet -praised be her name- to become one of the millions of frogs that leap from the flooding Nile every flood, and give her blessing to one worthy worshiper. I collect her price- an amulet, as token of your devotion, and in return bestow such a gift as even Pharaoh should envy. Though this place seems strange- if I may ask, where are we? For this is like nowhere in Egypt that I have ever been." <nl> "America?" Alice's mouth mumbled rather of its own accord, <nl> "Ah, Armenia! The mountains are lovely indeed, though the natives sadly refuse to respect our froggy mistress. <nl> There was a long pause then as Alice struggled to grasp what was happening, all while the Egyptian quietly smiled, unfazed by the silence. <nl> "You said that you are... I mean you want a price, an amulet?" she at last managed to stutter out. "Well, um, a few years ago I made like this frog necklace in art class, I tried to make it look like you, I mean the frog, because-" <nl> "Excellent!" Boomed the jovial man. "I accept your price! Armenian or not, you are surely in the cult of Heqet- no other would have cared to love our mistress! For she is difficult to love, yet all the more worthy of our love because of it! So what do you desire in return?" <nl> "A million dollars!" Alice exclaimed, not wanting to push her luck with this strange frogman too much. <nl> "Dollars?" The man frowned. "No, you misunderstand. Gracious Heqet is a *fertility* goddess, and fertility-related favors are all I may grant. Ease in childbirth is the most common request- are you pregnant or likely to become pregnant?" <nl> This odd declaration made Alice, who was slowly starting to calm down, start to feel like she was being pranked somehow. In that case, she had one chance to turn the tables back on the prankster, whomever had put this guy up to this, or she'd never live this down. <nl> "Well then, mister Froggy," she said with all the sarcasm she could muster. "I wish to be turned into the most BEAUtiful woman in the world, so beautiful that I will never have to put up with a silly prank like yours ever again!" <nl> The Egyptian frowned for a moment, before gulping and turning slightly green. After a moment, Alice got up and instinctively put her frog back in its tank, before collapsing in her bed in shock and confusion. <nl> She awoke a few hours later, convinced that what had occurred had been a dream- until she looked in the mirror. Teenage insecurity could not hide the fact that seemed regal yet familiar, beautiful beyond compare- yes, these were the sort of looks that could found a Dynasty. <eos>

<sos> "You're not welcome here, you need to leave," Ricardo said through the translator.  A mixture of twelve men and women stood behind him dressed in an assortment of clothing.  They looked bored with the whole thing. <nl> "What?" Commander Ellison Hart asked in confusion, "We have spent three centuries rebuilding and preparing to liberate you."  Behind her was a platoon of the Liberation Force's finest soldiers dressed in all manner of smart cybernetic armor. <nl> "You abandoned us," he answered with a shrug, "You took everything you thought was of value with you.  You left us with nothing, not even food.  Do you know how many people starved that first winter?" <nl> "We were losing the war!" Hart shouted, "We created the wormhole to Delta Sigma 6 and spent the last three centuries building a military force to return.  You were never forgotten.  We always had plans to return for you."  The last was a lie as they didn't expect to find any survivors. <nl> "How touching," one of the women behind Ricardo said then added, "That did a lot of good to my great, great, great grandparents as you left them the choice of being dissolved into a nutrient paste by the Inralldi or slowly die to lack of basic materials.  This was all caused by you stealing everything. You're filthy thieves." <nl> "Thieves? Us?" a man in a general's outfit behind Hart angrily retorted before she can stop him, "Everyone of value was taken in the evacuation.  That says a lot about who you were descended from.  We just left the criminals and scu..." <nl> "Quiet!" Hart ordered him but she could see the native Earther's were rankled by this.  She reminded herself to bust him back down to private later, "I apologize for that outburst." <nl> "Commander, a moment," someone said behind her and the negotiations paused for the moment, both sides eyeing one another warily.  She approached Major Laurens who was in charge of intel, "Our drones indicate that the Nearthers, native earthers that is, are six billion strong.  The population three hundred years ago was just under a billion so they've been having some fun.  Sorry, sir." He said when he noticed her frown.  She nodded for him to continue, "Agriculture is their main focus followed by specialized production through three dimensional printing.   Each home seems to have one to meet all their needs.  They are really quite advanced in..." <nl> "So no threat?" Hart asked him. <nl> "None that I can see," he stated flatly then began to ask but was cut off, "But how did they defeat the..." <nl> "Attention delegates," Hart shouted and everyone gathered around, "In the light of recent intel I'll make this simple."  She turned to Ricardo and the group of survivors and smiled coldly, "In orbit around this planet are about sixty thousand ships of all shapes and sizes.  If I give the order the surface of this planet can be scoured of all life to a depth of about six feet below the topsoil level.  I want you to remember this as we continue negotiations." <nl> "Are you threatening us?" Ricardo asked icily.  She noticed dangerous smiles playing on the faces of those around him and felt a sudden feeling of panic which she fought down.  Hart could feel weapons being primed through mind-links behind her and gave a mental order to stand down. <nl> "No," she answered, "I am simply stating the facts.  You may have defeated the Inralldi but our force was designed to have a 99.8% chance of victory against them.  I am just saying that we are back and we want half the planet returned to us.  You can safely live on your..." <nl> "Half the planet?"  Ricardo laughed, "You ran like cowards across the stars to lick your wounds and tell each other to be brave while you prayed the Inralldi wouldn't chase you.  You left our ancestors to die and now you return with demands?  You have no right to make demands.  You have made a grave error today, cowards." <nl> "Ricardo, be reasonable," Hart stated, giving the mental order to set weapons to stun and ordering the fleet to get ready to give a non-lethal show of force, "We hold all the cards." <nl> "Commander," Ricardo said spitting out her title as if it were acid on his tongue, "Your error, hell our error, was in thinking the Inralldi were here to destroy the Earth.  You thought they were here to make meals of us.  They seemed to be a mindless, purposeless race of alien blobs that dropped from the skies and turned humans into goo." <nl> "They were," Hart said simply, "How did you stop them?  We need this intel in case we ever run into them again - for humanity's sake!" <nl> "We didn't." Ricardo said and with these two words weapons primed both in the soldiers around Hart and in the ships orbiting above her, "They were an entity sent here to discover our biology.  They dissolved us and took us into themselves not to eat but to study.  Their mission was not to destroy - their mission was to Uplift.  To remake us for maximum survival." <nl> Her mind-link suddenly went berserk with orbital chatter.  Millions of blobs were attaching themselves to and breaching the fleet above them. <nl> "You've betrayed us," Hart told him simply, lifting her rifle as they were suddenly surrounded by thousands of "uplifted" humans, "You've betrayed humanity!" <nl> "We *are* humanity," Ricardo said, "The new humanity.  You see, you fear they changed the way we think but they did not.  They left us our free will to do what we want within the new bodies they molded for us.  We are no more alien than you are, Commander.  You, however, represent the very worst of us.  You are the great betrayers.  You are the cowards.  *You* are the dregs of humanity that fled across space with your tails between your legs when you should have stood and fought beside us.  You left a billion to starve or die always trying to convince yourselves it was necessary.  Remember, I told you to leave - running away is something you are infinitely good at.  You have no place in the new universal order." <nl> No more words were said as the battle started. <eos>

<sos> **The Pacifist** <nl> She refused. Someone had to be the first to not participate in this sadistic game. When the starting siren activated, she sat down and closed her eyes. She let the feelings of anxiety and self-preservation flow through her. Yes, she feared death, but what was she, an individual, compared to the whole of the oppressed? A boy she befriended hid in the bushes nearby. He shouted at her to get up, to survive, to fight the monsters that had done this to them. She refused. The arrow through the skull came sudden and sharp. It was as painful as all her imagination had told her. To her credit, she did not scream, as her thoughts focused on forgiveness. She forgave the other contestants. All they wanted to do was to survive. She forgave the government, for all they knew was cruelty. She forgave the people, who believed that the only point of existence was bloodshed. She forgave her parents, who gave her up for a scrap of food. She died with a smile on her face. <nl> **The Hunter** <nl> He found a grim resolve. One down, nineteen to go. Unless they killed each other first. He doubted it, they were barely more than children. They did not have the killer instinct honed through decades of existence. <nl> He frowned. The boy had not rushed to the girl's body. He remembered that they flirted with each other in the pre-event period. Idiots. You were not supposed to fraternize with the enemy, especially when survival was at stake. He waited five more minutes and sighed. <nl> His position was too dangerous. He loosened the string of his bow and stood up. The smell of pine needles wafted into his nose. He needed to move before another contestant found him. He peered at the sun setting in the East. Yes, head in that direction. Ambush anyone when the sun was in their eyes. <nl> He approached the edge of the meadow. He needed to hurry before sunset came. His mind sketched a path before him, and he ran through the meadow. What he did not know was that the government had seeded the meadow with landmines. Only when the smell of gunpowder and dried blood reached his nostrils did he realize his mistake. <nl> **The Sadist** <nl> The explosion was music to her ears. Yes, people who took this too seriously were punished. What fool thought that this was a fair game? Her only regret was that she hadn't killed the hapless victim herself. She pointed her rifle at the moon and fired. An irrational response, but one that made sense to her. Let her would-be hunters stalk her, then understand what suffering truly meant. <nl> She grinned as screams echoed throughout the valley. What a wonderful idea this government had! Cater to the bloodlust of the people, and rebellion would be the furthest thing from their minds! Then came a fly in the ointment. She should be the one enjoying this, not some fat government bureaucrats sitting in a golden office. The jealousy came like lightning on a bright summer day. <nl> The cries for help from two teenage girls intrigued her. She headed towards their direction.At the edge of a seaside cliff, she found one of them holding the other, preventing her from plunging into the sea below. Her laugh echoed like a clear crystal bell. <nl> "Well, well, well. What have we here? Looks like one of you is in trouble," she said. <nl> The one on the cliffside preventing the other from falling glanced at her. "Please," she begged. "We got to help Christie." <nl> The sadist laughed and pointed her rifle at the beggar. "Bitch, why do you think I care?" she asked. <nl> She did not hear the answer as a cold knife plunged through her back. She gasped as her consciousness dissolved into oblivion. <nl> **The Survivor** <nl> He ran towards the girl and pulled her friend up. Blood from the sadist dripped from his hands onto her face. He pulled again and they both got the fallen girl onto the clifftop. A drone above flashed as it took a picture. <nl> All three of them lay on the grass, breathing hard. He clutched his chest, feeling his adrenaline and the guilt that coursed over him. Another girl lay nearby, a sniper rifle prominently displayed next to her body. Tears streamed down his face. His breath came out in short gasps. <nl> After half an hour, the girl he helped sat up. The girl they rescued, Christie, touched her leg. <nl> "What do we do?" the girl who sat up cried. <nl> He focused on the stars above. He thought about the girl who had refused to fight. "We don't give the bastards what they want," he replied. <eos>

<sos> >Ridicule. I spent five years being utterly, totally humiliated by friends, family and coworkers who called me *paranoid* or 'insane'. They said it was absurd to spend tens of thousands of dollars on a bunker equipped to keep me alive in a zombie apocalypse. Rejecting the civil standard to spend all of my money furthering my lineage with spawn was frowned upon. <nl> >Well, I'd *love* to see them now. To see their laughing faces rotted and sloughing off skulls, with eyeballs melting out of their sockets. When disaster struck, I bet they all thought of me. I bet they went running through their front doors, desperately clamoring down the desolated streets to make it here. I never heard them knock, though, not in the first weeks, so they must've been caught along the way. They must've cried out in terror, shrieking with pain, remembering their mockery of me. <nl> >It's been over a month, since then, however. I do miss them occasionally, when the pangs of loneliness strike from time to time, but the hundreds of books, video games and movies I stockpiled keep me occupied enough. I also make sure to review all my handbooks and survival guides on living in a zombie apocalypse every morning to keep my mind fresh. It's a ritual, one that will continue to keep me alive, though these works are not perfect. They are purely speculative, written based on imagined occurrences and assumptions. <nl> >Well, friends, I have decided to compile this book, of sorts- my own survival guide, and in some senses, a diary. A log of events that occur in these post-modern days. In it, I will cover what I know about the apocalypse, and what I know of the effects this unknown virus has on humans. Through time, perhaps I will begin to venture outward and learn more, but that will have to wait. Why, you ask? <nl> >Because, as you most likely know, they're *intelligent*. I mean, almost indistinguishable from a normal human. Sometimes, they come banging on my exterior barricades and the exochamber, proclaiming that the virus has been contained. They tell me it's safe, and demand that I open the door. Some have even impersonated people I knew from a previous life, feigning the wavering voice of my mother or sister. Can they impersonate that well? Or is this a virus that, for lack of a better description, controls minds, reshaping a person? <nl> >Regardless of the details, they think me a fool, like all the others who stayed out and perished. But I, like you, am the opposite. I will not yield. <nl> >I will survive." <nl> Lisa put the booklet down, a worn old thing fraying at the edges with smudges of black ink on the fore-edges. After a deep sigh, she turned her head down and wiped at wetness on her cheeks. This was her son, after all, her own boy, and his obsession was apparent from the first sentence. She sensed the pain and gripping fear that must have held him so tightly that he felt crushed by it. She wondered, *Can I make it through the rest of this?* <nl> He was dead, now, and she cried not for his death, but his life. <nl> His poor, wretched life. <nl> ------- <nl> *Part two is below!* <nl> */r/resonatingfury* <eos>

<sos> Conversations raged in the downtown, restaurant. For once, I had worn everyday civilian clothing. If it weren't for the myriad of scars on my face; I could have passed for *normal*. <nl> 'The main course,' A waiter said with his eyes pinned to the floor. 'Enjoy.' <nl> I watched the waiter slink away, and then pulled out my phone. While my food grew cold, I did my best to photograph it in the best light. I moved in, and out. I changed filters, and as the heat left each strand of pasta, I thought of the best hashtag. <nl> I uploaded the photo, geotagged with my location and in the caption wrote "#datenight". <nl> I picked at my food while I waited. <nl> And then, twenty minutes after my social media cry for help, a boom echoed from the streets. Conversations died, and people flocked to the window, still chewing. Dust, debris and smoke rolled against the restaurant window. <nl> *Three... two... one.* <nl> The door burst open, and the brass bell rattled like a distressed uvula. <nl> 'Where is she!?' Captain M demanded. <nl> The woman in bulging spandex scanned the room, glossing over the bystanders who stood with strands of pasta hanging from their mouths. I waved at Captain M and received a hateful glower. <nl> 'Over here.' I said. <nl> I blinked in time with her thumping footsteps and continued to blink as she towered above me. <nl> 'Don't waste my time.' <nl> 'Have a seat.' <nl> Captain M lifted me by my neck, bringing my bulging face level with hers. <nl> 'Fine -' I choked. '- have my seat.' <nl> Captain M blew a gold strand of hair from her face and said. 'Stop wasting my time.' <nl> The grip on my neck tightened so that only particles of air could escape. Captain M continued scanning the room, and then fixed on the bathroom. <nl> 'Are you keeping her hostage in *there*?' <nl> I mimed speaking and then wringing a dishcloth, while a gargling sound came from my throat. <nl> Captain M dropped me, and while I nursed my throat, she said. 'Speak.' <nl> 'There is no girl.' I said. <nl> 'Liar!' <nl> Captain M withdrew her phone, from what looked like a custom sewed pouch. She tapped against the screen with increasing frustration and then removed her glove. The jabbing stopped, and she turned the screen so that I could see the photo I had posted. <nl> I smiled. 'You know. People don't post their real-life online.' <nl> 'Stop playing games.' Captain M said. <nl> 'You know,' I said picking myself off the floor. 'it's oddly comforting how quickly you came.' <nl> Captain M cocked a concealed eyebrow. <nl> 'Some would say that you're jealous.' <nl> 'What!?' <nl> 'You've interrupted five of my dates now,' I said and bopped a finger against her arm. 'Some would say that's obsessive.' <nl> 'No!' Captain M glanced around the room of silent onlookers. 'Impossible. You are a menace, and those weren't dates you deluded fool.' <nl> A waiter, the one who had avoided my face, approached Captain M and presented her with a pizza. <nl> 'From the gentleman that you were choking,' The waiter said. <nl> I pulled back a chair and gestured for Captain M to sit. <nl> --- <nl> /r/WrittenThought <nl> Want to read more? - [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WrittenThought/comments/au7ov8/super_opposite_part_2/) <eos>

<sos> "So, Victor, how's life?" <nl> "It's going well, Alex- hard times at work, as usual, but nothing too out of the ordinary. How are you?" <nl> "Oh, fine, some of the same, really." <nl> I'd been "dating" Victor for three months, but this was the first time we'd actually gone to a restaurant. I'd rather have kept it at home- those super-fools in the League kept foiling my attempts at romance every single time I went out- but for him, I couldn't say no. <nl> "Remind me, what do you do again?" <nl> "Me? I sell jewelry and exotic items." *Of course, I lift them myself, but hey, he doesn't need to know, right?* "How about you?" <nl> "Oh! I'm in law enforcement. Mainly work in the sciences, but I get into the field a lot as well." <nl> "Neat." <nl> At this point, our waiter returns with our main courses, and places it on the table. <nl> "One order of fettuccine for the *signor,* and a double *arrabbiatta* for the *signora*." <nl> My date turns to me. "Double order?" <nl> "Yeah... I've had a metabolism like a jet engine since the age of fourteen." <nl> He shrugs. <nl> "Hey, mind if I take a picture?" <nl> "No problem." <nl> I take a selfie of the two of us, and post it to my Instapict account. <nl> "First date in six months!!!" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> Of course, Victor got interrupted not two minutes after that. <nl> "I'm sorry, this is important. It's from work. I have to go." <nl> He got up from the table, and ran toward the exit. I was just able to make out some of the words he said: <nl> "Hostage situation... *Where?*...I can be ready in three, meet me inside... Yes, I've got it..." <nl> My face fell. *And just when I thought this was going so well!* <nl> Of course, my night only went from bad to worse. The League of Superheroes came barging into the restaurant. <nl> "Over-Woman! Come out with your hands up!" <nl> *Over-Woman.* The most feared super-villain in the world. Capable of lifting an aircraft carrier, flying at ten thousand miles per hour, and tearing people in half with her mind. <nl> Also- coincidentally- my secret identity. <nl> *...Goddamn it!* <nl> &#x200B; <nl> The League had brought out all of their heavy hitters. <nl> Joule, the pyrokinetic. <nl> Peregrine, a man with powers to match mine, save for the telekinesis. <nl> Mensa, a Psi of the highest order. <nl> And my old rival, Invictus. A man without powers, but with a battle-suit capable enough to take me on. <nl> If I were to try to get out of this, I would level six city blocks. <nl> However, the League didn't seem to realize that meek little Alexandra Thorne was the fearsome villain they were looking for. I tried to sneak by them, until... <nl> "You. Where are you going?" <nl> It was Invictus. *Oh, crap.* <nl> He walked straight at me, examining me curiously. <nl> He pressed a button on the side of his mask. It hissed open, revealing... wait. <nl> Surely my eyes were playing tricks on me. That sandy hair, those eyes... no. <nl> That was *Victor's* face! <nl> &#x200B; <nl> Invictus... *Victor*... seemed as startled as I was. <nl> He turned to the team. <nl> "I got a call. About a supervillain and a hostage situation. What is going on here?" <nl> Joule replied. "We'd been tracking Over-Woman's social media accounts. She'd made a post about being on a date at this very restaurant. We assumed it was a hostage situation, and called you, knowing how good you were at dealing with her." <nl> Victor pulled out his phone. "Was it this post?" <nl> "Yes! That's the one!" <nl> He face-palmed. "That's not Over-Woman, that's my girlfriend!" <nl> "Hey, Algorist did the math, that has a 99.97 percent chance of being her. Right build, right face shape, even the same writing style." <nl> "Oh, go tell Algorist that he needs to check his calculations. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date." <nl> &#x200B; <nl> After all the heroes were gone, and after he'd ditched the battle-suit, Victor turned to me. <nl> "Sorry about that. My team sometimes gets bad leads and hares off in the wrong direction." <nl> "Thanks for sticking up for me back there. I don't know what I would have done without you." <nl> "Least I could do. ...Hey, though, you aren't actually Over-Woman, are you?" <nl> "Would I tell you if I was?" <nl> He laughed. "True. Even if you were... well, that would just prove even the greatest super-villains can have a heart." <nl> \*\*\*\*\*\* <nl> Feedback welcome! <eos>

<sos> ######[](#dropcap) <nl> The woman's eyes flashed. Her gaze flickered downwards for just a moment before they came up again. <nl> "Are you sure?" The words came out silky smooth, almost inhuman. Pietra bit her lip, then glanced back towards her friends. Matthew was bent over double with laughter, while Manny waved at her and then shook his fist. <nl> "Yes," she said. "How much will this cost?" <nl> The lady smiled. "Not much." <nl> It was a good thing her father lacked anything but money. She pulled a black credit card from her pocket. <nl> The lady shook her head and smiled. "Oh no, you'll pay when you reach the destination." <nl> "Um..." Pietra leaned closer to the counter. "Where am I headed exactly?" <nl> "You'll know when you get there." <nl> And with that cryptic statement, the woman behind the counter pressed a button out of sight, and a small gap in the counter opened up to reveal a thin, rectangular glass box with a ticket inside. She opened it gingerly, then handed it to Pietra, who took it. It had a surprising weight to it, yet the texture wasn't quite right. She brushed over the unrecognizable letters with her finger, the sensation like water sliding over glass. The sense of unease she'd felt up to this moment vanished as soon as she held the ticket in her hands. <nl> It centered her. It was almost as if she knew everything would be alright in that moment. She turned back to her friends and waved, giving them a bright smile. <nl> Yes. She was ready for the adventure of a lifetime. Maybe she was going to Australia. Maybe to China. But wherever it was, she knew she would be ready for it. Without hesitating, she walked towards the gates. The crowds around her parted like water, the air around her seeming to grow more pure, lighter. <nl> She could barely hear the voices of her friend's panicked voices now, telling her to stay, as she walked through security with no luggage. <nl> There were no other passengers on the plane. But somehow, that made sense. It was just as it should be. Pietra sighed in relief. The ticket grew hotter in the palm of her hand, but it was a familiar heat. She chose a random seat, gazing at the random rows ahead of her. Then she closed her eyes. <nl> *** <nl> "Ma'am, we've arrived." <nl> A gentle shake on her shoulder. Pietra's eyes slowly drifted open. It was the woman from the airline counter. <nl> "Where are we?" she asked groggily. <nl> "3014." <nl> Pietra cocked her head to the side. "What is that? A country number?" <nl> The woman smiled. She gently grabbed ahold of Pietra's wrist and pressed a device to it. Two little mild shocks of pain, almost imperceptible and lightning fast, and Pietra withdrew her wrist. She stared down at the two tiny blue dots on it. <nl> "It's the year. Your payment is complete." <nl> "I don't understand," Pietra said, her brows furrowing in disbelief. "The year? And what payment?" <nl> The woman smiled back brightly. "Yes, it's the year 3014. And your payment of 2 years of your life. That's how we do things here. Trading life for experiences. It promotes highly calculative decision making, and people on average cite a much higher quality of life before they cycle through again." The woman gestured toward the exit door. "Welcome, Pietra. I certainly hope you enjoy your stay." <nl> **** <nl> r/AlannaWu <eos>

<sos> "Thank you for holding. Your call is very important to us. Please remain on the line and your call will be answered in the order in which it was received. Thank you." <nl> "I can't believe they're STILL using on-hold music from the twentieth century." I shook my head and looked at my copilot. "Who'd you say this company was, again?" <nl> Ktar shrugged and moved one of his tentacles forward, peering at the owner's manual with his close-range eyes. His voice echoed from the ship's speakers, tied into the language synthesizer in his head. "Some Terrain-based company called 'Apple,' it appears. Sound familiar?" <nl> "Terrain or Earth?" I jerked a thumb behind me in what I hoped was the direction of one of the two. "They are two separate places, you know. Terrain is what most of Earth moved to after the fourth World War..." <nl> "Ah, apologies. Earth-based, not Terrain based." <nl> "Great." I shook my head. In the background, the echo of "... on the line and your call will be answered..." continued. "I didn't realize any Earth-based tech still existed out there. You're SURE that's who built the drive? A fracking EARTH company?" <nl> "You can read this if you want." Even through the synthesizer, it wasn't hard to tell Ktar's sarcastic voice. "After all, we might be here a while." <nl> "I hope not. Should just be an easy fix." I looked back at the comm port. How long have we been on hold anyway?" <nl> "Twenty-two hours, fourteen minutes..." <nl> A pleasant voice interrupted Ktar. "Thank you for calling Apple customer support, my name is Alice, how can I help you?" <nl> "Oh thank god." I stretched and grinned toward the comm port. "You can't see me, but I'm happy as a lark over here. Wasn't sure anyone still answered the phone over there." <nl> "Indeed we do, sir. What seems to be the trouble today?" <nl> "The engine's out, and I'll be dipped if I can see a way to open it up and work on it." <nl> "Can I have the model number?" <nl> "The what?" <nl> "The model number. Or the serial number, either one of those will get me to the right area to assist you." <nl> "Uh." I looked at Ktar, who shrugged. That was quite a sight to see from the eight-eyed giant squid. "Where, ah... would I find this?" <nl> "Do you have your manual?" <nl> "Oh!" I held up the manual, forgetting for a moment she couldn't see me. "Right here!" <nl> "Your model number should be listed somewhere on the front cover, and your serial number is likely inside the first page." <nl> "Ok, um... Model looks like a Lightstar 40x? I guess? And the serial is 4x135q55p#?" <nl> "Thank you. Looks like you're still under warranty, so that's a good thing." <nl> "We are?" I blinked. I'd received the space ship as a hand-me-down graduation gift from my mother, and that had been nearly 40 life cycles ago. "Wow. That's a heck of a warranty." <nl> "Well, we build them to last, sir. We stand by our products. So along with the warranty..." <nl> "So never mind that though. How do I get in to fix this?" <nl> "Sir?" <nl> I looked over at Ktar. He'd fallen asleep. "I need to get into the engine to refire it and get moving again. How do I do that?" <nl> "With that model... hmm. You don't, sir." <nl> "Pardon?" <nl> "That unit is self-contained. Only an Apple authorized ship repair facility would be able to access the interior and repair it." <nl> "No, I just need an access port, and I can get in..." <nl> "There is no access port, sir." <nl> "There's what." I blinked. "Why would... what? So what am I supposed to do? We're stuck!" <nl> "No worries, sir. You're covered under the emergency clauses of the warranty, so someone will be heading your way as soon as I've located the nearest repair facility to your current location. Do you mind holding while I get this worked up?" <nl> "Uh, sure?" I blinked as the hold music returned. No access port? The thought of sitting here and waiting wasn't all that appealing, but the lady on the comm had seemed pretty confident. Maybe there was a repair facility all the way out here in the Orion-Cygnus Arm? <nl> After a fairly long time, the woman came back. "Ok, sir, I've arranged everything. We've got your coordinates locked in and your engine transponder is sending us a signal so we can trace if you drift while we are on our way to your location. Just sit tight and someone will be there soon." <nl> "Wait!" I could tell from her tone she was about to hang up. "How long are we talking here?" <nl> "Well, given your current coordinates, it's going to take our nearest repair facility some time to reach you..." <nl> "That's not my question. How long?" <nl> "... 48 light cycles." <nl> "... what?" <nl> "Thank you for calling Apple customer service, sir, and someone will be in contact with you once they are nearby. Have a nice day." <nl> Stunned, I could only stare at the comm port as I heard Ktar clear his throat beside me. "So, ah, boss... 48 light cycles until we're rescued then?" <nl> "Looks that way." <nl> "We have food for 200 light cycles, plus the cargo, so we won't starve." <nl> "Nope. So... what do you want to do?" <nl> "Cards?" <nl> "Sure. Why not." <nl> &#x200B; <nl> \* <nl> r/MattWritinCollection/ <eos>

<sos> At this time on a Wednesday, market day would usually be in full swing. Marvin would be selling his melons at a stall on the northern side of the dusty square, the fishermen would be selling slightly-rotten catches from the eastern bay, and the local priest would be shouting himself hoarse in an effort to convert more locals. <nl> Usually. <nl> Today the town square was silent, because it was known that the Tasslebelt Gang were intent on finally finishing their long-running feud with Vora Silver. <nl> There were three of them, and their sense of hygiene was appalling. Unkempt beards, dirty hats, and a distinct scent of the Temu, the large bird-like creatures which served as transport on the frontier. <nl> Across from them stood Ms Silver, her hat forgotten on a chair in her office, and a six-shooter on her belt. Not that it'd do her much good - the three gang members shimmered with arcane energies, the hallmark of Kessle's Greater Bullet Shield. She knew, therefore, that they were serious - by her count that left them all with just two more lifetime uses of that spell. <nl> She responded in kind, whirling her arms to ward herself and feeling the sense of her own bullet shield hugging her skin and clothes closely. <nl> The drawl of Milton, the gang leader, sounded loud from across the square. "How's yer wellspring today, Vora? I bet you used up some damn useful spells breaking up that tavern brawl, right?" <nl> Vora narrowed her eyes further. Her earlier suspicions were confirmed - that brawl at Moira's had been no coincidence. It wasn't surprising that that gang had tried to drain her of her greater spells before taking her on this afternoon. She'd used her last use of Taker's Binding Buckles to bring the culprits into custody. <nl> "Dammit, Milton. That's a low blow," she shouted across the square. "I thought you all liked Moira - her place is such a mess now." <nl> The gang members looked at each other and chuckled. Milton just smiled, his crooked teeth showing through. He spat the toothpick out of his mouth and cracked his knuckles, sparks of energy playing around them. <nl> Silence in the square for the next ten seconds, as both sides stared at each other. <nl> Milton piped up once more. "Heh, I've been lookin' forward to this, Miss. Ever since you got my brother locked up for that stagecoach robbery, I've been wantin' revenge. Saved up some pretty little spells for the occasion." <nl> As he finished his sentence, he flicked his hand down to his side. An aura of power flared around him, casting shadows from both of his companions. The indescribable color of magic meant that whatever he was using next, it was going to be big. <nl> Vora didn't give him a chance. She shunted her palm forward forcefully, and burned her lifetime's last use of Grant's Spell Nullification. The aura faded from sight. But Milton's smile didn't change. He clucked his tongue, his voice dripping with sarcasm for his next sentence. <nl> "Oh dear, Ms Silver. Looks like you gone stopped my best spell. Whatever shall I do next?" He looked sideways at the gang members next to him. <nl> Both members flared in a less powerful fashion, their arms moving in the recognizable form of Hogan's Empowerment. Once they finished casting their spells, for the next minute they'd both move with superhuman speed and strength. <nl> Milton clicked his fingers and a small flame emerged. This was, Vora knew, his unlimited spell. He'd never need a cigarette lighter his entire life. He brought a cigar up to his mouth, and lit it. <nl> "Such a shame that you can't counterspell them, Ms Silver." He pulled a shoddy-looking notebook from his pocket. "You see, I been watchin' you a long while now. I know which spells you got left - and it's gonna take all of them to stop my boys here. I'll just wait until you're all drained and done. Get her, boys." <nl> Vora cursed and quickly invoked Mann's Resilient Defence, combining her knowledge of the arcane with her martial arts knowledge. The flurry of blows came fast and consistently. More than one breached her defenses, leaving bruises, and cuts where she wasn't so careful. She parried blow after blow with her forearms, pushing any advantage she was given to land a counterattack. But when one of the pair of attackers got desperate, and invoked Whizzle's Flaming Fist, she had no choice. She dropped Resilient Defence and used Irwin's Clenching Grasp to cause the brown dirt of the town square to swell up and snap around the two attackers. They were entombed, and there were now just two in the square - her, exhausted, out of spells, down on both knees, and her attacker. <nl> Who swelled with the power of several spells, the energy tearing rifts in reality around him. <nl> The entire time she'd been distracted, he'd been buffing himself with every spell in his arsenal. And she had nothing left. <nl> Milton just laughed. Laughed too hard, too much like a night at the theater rather than a fight to the death. He advanced slowly, his spurs clinking, and his hands actually flickering into and out of existence with sheer arcane power. <nl> Vora's eyes flitted around the square - checking the windows for someone, anyone. But there was no-one to be seen, no one who wanted to risk the wrath of the gang by watching. <nl> Perfect. <nl> She kept her head low, and let her opponent advance. But her arms worked at her sides, with complex gestures that it had taken her an extortionate amount of time to master. If she got this wrong, it would spell disaster. <nl> Milton had actually now stopped, five feet in front of her. His right arm weaved a circle in reality - empowering his body with an invocation unknown to Vora. <nl> So Vora counterspelled it with Grant's Spell Nullification. And his other spells, one after the other, after the other. The force of the termination repelled Milton, by a foot at a time. He tried to fight it, but it was useless - he was knocked back. <nl> As the energy disappeared from Milton's body, the triumphant smile on his face faded into a look of bewilderment. He looked around himself at his feet, his arms, his torso - he didn't understand what was happening. He was certain she'd been out of spells - he'd been counting for the last two years! <nl> Which was when the form of Vora stood up from the ground, pulled out her pistol, and shot him square in the forehead. He collapsed to the ground lifeless. <nl> And Vora thanked the stars that her unlimited spell, the one which she could use an unlimited amount of times, was Silver's Spell Refresher. <nl> And she collapsed to the ground, utterly drained, but victorious. <eos>

<sos> "Has he figured it out yet?" Stacey wiped the blood from the thin line across her neck as the flesh stitched together. <nl> Brad huffed. "No." <nl> "The fuck is taking so goddamn long?" Ellen helped her thigh in place, braced against the door to the cabin. The blood around her had thickened to a deep dark brown as the sinew of muscle slithered out to pull the severed limb nearer. <nl> "He's one of those back wood's yokel types." Brad shook out his shirt, drops of the dark brown blood clumping on the floor with the buckshot. "Horror movie stand-ins." <nl> "Motherfucker probably doesn't know how to read," Ellen said. <nl> "Come on, that's not fair." Stacey put her hands on her hips and glared down the other two. Her skin stuck to the hip of her pants, sticky mess layering her fingers. "He's trying his best." <nl> "Is Will back yet?" Ellen asked. <nl> Brad shook his head. "Still outside. Don't think he got him-" The quick shot interrupted <nl> Brad and followed with a throaty terrible scream. <nl> "I don't see why he shoots your two fucks," Ellen grumbled. "Why do they always like to cut up girls?" <nl> Stacey smiled and shook her shoulders. "We're clearly cuter, deserving of more attention." <nl> "You scream more," Brad said without turning from the window. <nl> "I most certainly do NOT scream more than Will. Listen to him," Ellen waved at the door as her leg finished reattaching. With a weak hobble, refusing Stacey's offered hand, she stood. <nl> Outside Will cried and moaned, pleading, begging, bargaining for his unending life. <nl> "That is overboard." <nl> "He's selling it," Brad smirked. <nl> Stacey nodded. "Will's always wanted to be an actor." <nl> "He's killed Will twice now. *Twice*." Ellen joined Brad at the window and looked out onto the misty night. Between the trees, a dim light blared casting shadows of the two figures in the far distance. <nl> "Maybe that's why it's taking so long?" Stacey joined them, her hips wiggling between Brad and Ellen. "Think he's looking harder?" <nl> "Take your top off and he might," Brad leered at Stacey's loose fitted top as it gaped to show her bra. <nl> "No. Not again. Last time that hook freak tried to bite them. It may not last long but it hurts and that's an image I just never want to see again. " Stacey shuddered. "His teeth were *sooo* yellow." <nl> "How about you, Brad?" Ellen smacked his shoulder. Another round of bloody buckshot rolled from his shirt. "It's current year. You could be his type. Take your shirt off and have a go at the old man?" <nl> Before he could answer the back door slammed open and Will lumbered toward the three. <nl> His shirt dripped with fresh red blood. The side of his face was mangled and the lower half <nl> of his jaw sat slack. Despite the wound the wide grin, lopsided and dripping, reached nearly to his ear. <nl> "He sot 'e in eh ace!" <nl> The three "teens" stifled their laughs as Will joined them at the window. <nl> "Whose turn now?" Stacey asked. <nl> "Brad." <nl> "'Ads." <nl> "Oh yeah, definitely Brad." <nl> Brad sighed and rolled his eyes. He moved to take off his bloody shirt but Ellen shook her head and stopped him. "Leave it on. Give the poor sap a chance to recognize you." <nl> "If he shoots me in the fucking face..." <nl> "I'll walk out topless if he does," Stacey countered. <nl> Brad nodded as he chuckled and opened the front door. He took in a deep breath and started to jog into the dark forest. "Will?" he called out. "Will? Where are you? This isn't funny, man!" <nl> "50 bucks says he shoots him." Ellen riffled through her pocket and pulled out the stained bills. <nl> "' 'eal." Will pulled out his wallet with his mangled fingers as his jaw clicked back into place. "Double if he's decapitated?" <nl> "You're on, smiley." <nl> "I missed our vacations." Stacey took their cash, tucked it into her blood stained top, and all three leaned into the window as the sound of a chainsaw rumbled from the hazed forest. <eos>

<sos> When I got home, my wife was already in bed watching TV. She barely answered when I greeted her with a kiss on the forehead. <nl> "Bad day?" I said, and after taking off my clothes, I joined her. <nl> She snorted. "Bad day? Terrible day. I swear this asshole keeps interfering with my job, and my boss is mad at me. I don't know what to do, honey." <nl> I frowned, drew an arm across her back, and she rested her head on my shoulder. "You've been too stressed lately, sweetie. I'm sure your boss will understand if you speak to him?" <nl> "He won't. I've already spoken with him, and all I got were swear words and an ultimatum." She rested her hand on my chest. <nl> "An ultimatum? I'm not sure if I'm following, sweetie. You are a cashier, how can someone interfere with that, and why doesn't your boss understand?" I gasped, blood rose to my face. "Wait, is he flirting with you and creating long lines of angry customers?" <nl> She hesitated. "No, he--he--he came to rob us three times this week!" Her hand slithered up my neck, caressing it with nails. <nl> "You're lying, Laura. What you're saying is utter nonsense." I took her hand away, straightened. "Tell me the truth." <nl> In that moment, when her dark, glossy eyes met mine, her hand moved underneath the sheets in a strange way, as if rummaging for something. I frowned, and in the space of a breath, my frown dissolved into raised brows, and my hands jumped to the air. <nl> For when she took her hand out of the sheet, she held a gun, and pointed it at me. <nl> "I'm sorry, Dave. I didn't want it to make it so messy." <nl> "Laura, what--what is this?" I said, my voice brittle, on the verge of breaking. <nl> "Ten times you stopped me, and ten attempts it took me to understand you were a better bodyguard than I expected," she said, her voice was cold, devoid of emotion. I gazed at her arm looking for signs of hesitation, but it was perfectly still, and she was perfectly calm. "I didn't want to reach this point, Dave. I truly didn't. But you didn't give me another option." <nl> "Wait! I can--I can fail next time. I can fail on purpose!" <nl> She shook her head. "You are too good, too passionate to betray your boss. I know you, honey. Besides, that'd be too great of a risk. Do you want to close your eyes, now?" <nl> I leaped forward, arms outstretched, to try and disarm her. <nl> She pulled the trigger. <nl> Nothing came out. <nl> I twisted her arm, held the other, locking her in place. "Eleven times, sweetie. Eleven times." I gazed at the door, and shouted, "The subject is under control!" <nl> "What is happening?" Laura asked as she thrashed. <nl> Victor, Colton and Red burst into the room. They were my boss's other bodyguards. <nl> "You should check if the gun is loaded before attempting to kill someone. I've been following you closely, sweetie. I can't believe you were truly going to kill me." <nl> "Fuck you, Dave." <nl> ------------------- <nl> r/NoahElowyn <eos>

<sos> *Bloody Mary.* <nl> The name came as a whisper, barely louder than the wind whistling in her ear. It happened often, though not as often as it used to. The world had changed. And it was this change that gave her hope. <nl> *Bloody Mary.* <nl> The girl rose to her feet as the black abyss surrounding her slowly began to morph into something more. How long had it been? She had tried to count, once, but lost interest rather quickly. Instead she sat in the bleak nothingness, never tiring, never feeling hunger. She simply existed--nothing more. But she had a plan. <nl> "Bloody Mary," the voice came clear as day. <nl> In front of her a cloud of gray smoke swirled and hissed. As it dissipated a sort of window came into view; on the other side stood three small children, no older than nine. They stood silent as she came into view: her black tangled hair hanging over her eyes, her face red and brown with dried blood, and her yellow smile. <nl> She knew she needed to act fast. The children's faces twisted in horror, and though it was too dark to be certain, she was sure one of them wet himself. There was only one way for her to escape her hell: to be set free upon the wish of an innocent. She opened her mouth, her speech prepared. <nl> "I am Mary, and I may grant--" <nl> The children screamed in unison. <nl> "No!" Mary called out, attempting to stop the inevitable. "I'm not going to--" <nl> It was too late. The children spun around and ran for the door. One of them reached up and slammed his hand into the light switch. The window snapped away into a cloud of smoke and Mary was once more left alone in the dark. <nl> But as she stood in silence, staring at where the window used to be, she noticed something different. A small shred of faint yellow light, almost impossible to see. <nl> She stepped forward and lifted a finger towards it, feeling its jagged edges. It was real. She forced her hand into it, cutting herself in the process. As she worked at the crack it widened and split and cracked, until it was wide enough to reach in with both hands. She grasped the edges and pushed them away from each other, creating a doorway in the abyss. <nl> And then she climbed through, into the room the children were in only moments before. <nl> r/Ford9863 <eos>

<sos> "Just to be clear, my family knows I'm here, and we've alerted the police where I am." Margaret said before reaching to her waist. "I've also got a gun and a knife right here. I want this on me at all times while I'm in here." She warned as the man nodded. <nl> "If you wish to see them and have them take you outside, just call." He said with a calm, almost pitying voice. "Feel free to leave whenever you wish." He added before walking away, sealing the door shut behind her. Shrugging, she sat back and played on her phone, ignoring the bleakness of the room before setting an alarm and taking a quick nap. When she woke up, she checked her digital watch before frowning, confused as to why her alarm didn't go off. <nl> "Huh. That's weird." She noted, finding only 10 minutes had passed. She still felt incredible tired, and decided to go back to sleep, taking another nap. This went on dozens of times, with her somehow waking up in decreasing increments. She was constantly fatigued, yet she always somehow woke up 10 minutes later. This went on until she noticed something odd. <nl> "What's with this jacket?" She wondered, reaching over to find a thick wool jacket on her. It was spring. Why on Earth did she have this jacket on her? She still had the gun on her, and her phone was still there. Quickly, she prepared to call up her brother before going pale. <nl> "No. No. This doesn't make sense." She said as she finally saw the date. Half a year had passed since she took the job. She frantically went through her phone, searching up the official time and date, assuming the phone to have glitched before checking her watch. <nl> "No. That's impossible. No. I just took a nap." She said in a frantic voice as her hair fell forward. She reached forward, grabbing at the long flowing locks that now reached down to her shoulders. No, her hair was short in a pixie cut! Not long! Her panic grew to horror as she found herself going through her photo gallery. <nl> "What the hell is this?" Margaret asked, going through her phone to find hundreds of photos and videos of her social outings with friends, family, and loved ones that she didn't recollect. <nl> Birthdays, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Saint Patrick's day, so many holidays and social outings. She was surrounded by friends, she had her family, so why couldn't she remember!? Why couldn't she!? She called up her mom, tears streaming down her face as a bout of sleepiness sent her mind into a black void. <nl> She woke up once more on the ground, another day passed. <nl> She tried to call again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. A year passed. Her mind trapped in the room but her body capable of leaving as it pleased. She ran outside, only to have her vision fade to black. Her mind began to scramble as she went through her phone, hoping she could get a text out. As she threw it open, she screamed finding thousands of texts exchanged between herself and the rest of her family during her dormant phases. <nl> "Mom: You okay honey? You seem a bit off." <nl> "Me: I'm fine mom. Don't worry." <nl> "Bro: Hey sis, you've been acting kinda weird lately. Wanna talk?" <nl> "Me: Im fine! Honest!" <nl> "Bro: You sure? I'm always around you know." <nl> "Me: Don't worry! I'm fine!" <nl> More and more conversations could be found, her family spotting the subtle differences between herself and the thing masquerading in her body. She cried, screaming for help from within room. When her brother threw the door open, her mind faded to nothing and she awoke once more on the concrete floor, trapped in the eternal loop. <nl> "Let me out. Please let me out. I want to go home." She whimpered, huddled in a ball while looking for her unseen torturer. The one that had stolen her body. She whimpered this for years, her psyche growing worse and worse. Yet in spite of her torture, she still looked normal. <nl> Her hair was long. She was dressed well, ate well, and lived well outside the dark little box. Her outside self still socialized with her friends and family while her true self was still trapped within the box, crying and begging for freedom. Despair overtook her as she took out her knife, carving messages on her own body begging for help. <nl> In response, her outer self wore long sleeve shirts, hiding the self inflicted messages as it continued to leave her trapped in the little box. Even so she continued to fight, struggling to get somebody... Anybody to listen. To get her out of the dark room. Yet she could never truly escape. It had her. It wouldn't let her leave. She was its slave now. <nl> "Please... Somebody... Anybody... Help me..." She wailed, pounding on the walls. Several more years had passed. She had a wedding ring now. Her true self had never met her husband. Based on the texts they exchanged, her alter ego was more outgoing than she ever was. He had fallen in love with something that wasn't her. He was ignorant of the person locked in the box. Everyone was. They were moving on. After 5 years of the isolation, she finally broke, her will to live at its end. <nl> "I... I'm not-I can't do this anymore. I can't. I won't." She said, her mind broken and the spark to live at its end. She went through her purse, taking a look to find a bottle of advil, her wallet, and all the usual stuff she had. Her revolver was still loaded and strapped to her waist as well. <nl> "No... This... Too messy... I'm scared..." She thought, tossing the gun across the room. She instead poured the entirety of the advil into her hand, swallowed them whole, and let it all end. <nl> And like that, her life was gone. Cold. Scared. Alone. <nl> Just when she was ready to experience oblivion, the doors opened as a warm set of hands grabbed her, taking her out of the room for the first time in years. <nl> "We're here for you." Were the words she heard before she passed out. <nl> ******************************************* <nl> "In other news, local businesswoman Margaret Anne has been admitted to the hospital for an attempted suicide attempt. For those of you unaware, Ms. Anne is quite a powerful woman, having a salary of roughly 1.5 million. She became the lifeblood of our little town of Oaksville after she took up a job with Carter and Marshall Inc and turned us into the wealthy area we are today. Supposedly, her husband found her passed out with her wrists slit and overdosing, but he was able to save her life just in time." <nl> "Wow Harry, who would've thought somebody as upbeat and cheery as her was suffering from depression? I spoke to her just last week, and she seemed so happy." <nl> "Well, it can strike anyone Mary. Luckily, her condition is stabilized and her loved ones are giving her all the attention and support they can give her." <nl> "I'm happy for her. She needs all the affection she can get right now." <eos>

<sos> The heart rate monitors flatlined. Doctor Rex bowed over the young man. "Shit. We need defib. STAT!" Amanda dashed to the wall and plucked the defibrillator off its hooks. She handed the paddles to Rex. "Clear!" He shouted and sent bolts of lighting through the dying man. He arched and shuddered, but the monitors still read a flat line. "Clear!" Rex shouted again, and jolted the man. Same results. Nothing. "One more time. Clear!" Rex sent one final, shuddering jolt through the paddles. No results. "Dammit. This one's gone. Too much blood loss. Amanda, call down to the meat locker? And wipe that creepy smile off your face. I swear, it's like you're turned on by this stuff." <nl> "Sorry! Yeah, I'm weird. Sorry. Yeah, I'll make sure it's taken down, yeah.." Amanda exited to the hallway and dialed the number. She turned around and there he was! Standing in the doorway. Tall, dark, handsome. He was so serious, like the forces of nature bent to his will. Dangerous, yet exciting. She couldn't help it: she smiled and twirled her fingers in her long, dark hair. He loomed so sexily over her. "Hey babe," he rumbled "I've got about five minutes before I have to report back. I'll meet you in room 1308C. See you soon...." and he drifted away. Damn, that worked on her every time, and he knew it. <nl> Amanda hadn't realized she was biting her lip so hard, so she was a little taken aback when Rex ducked out through the curtains and made uncomfortable eye contact. He approached and leaned over into her ear. "Quit that stuff or I'm going to HR. It's just plain weird." She gulped and nodded while Rex stalked off. <nl> She also hadn't realized that the receptionist was on the other line "Hello? Hello? Morgue office. Who's there?" She coughed and jumped on the call. "Hi! Hi, yes. Sorry about that. I was...um...distracted for a second. We have another fatality. Gang-related shooting. We're sending it down to you guys." <nl> "Roger. Any notes?" <nl> "Nope, pretty run-of-the-mill chest wounds." <nl> "Cool. Will you be taking him down?" <nl> "Yeah, just give me a couple minutes. I have an urgent call." <nl> "Oh? What about?" <nl> "Something about burying a bone. See you soon!" Amanda hung up and veritably dashed up to the thirteenth floor. Rex just didn't get it. Death made her hot. <eos>

<sos> "What?" <nl> "I said, 'CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?'" <nl> "I can't hear you!" <nl> Roll'gash the Devourer shrugged, looking at Eshandii the Beautiful, both straining to hear the telephone on the table between them. <nl> "I can't hear him, can you?" <nl> "I think he was asking for someone to pick him up before we go to slots," the (formerly) radiant being responded, hunched over her tea. <nl> "That damn Department of Transportation has thwarted us for the last time!" Roll'gash roared, haltingly, liverspotted eyes fluttering. "First they took Gal-" A wheezing cough interrupted her rant, and she reached for a mug with his trembling claw. Her throat bobbed as she devoured the herbal tea. Slowly. <nl> "Where was I?" <nl> "Hmm?" asked Eshandii, watching a squirrel raid the bird feeder. She rose to tap on the glass of the sliding door. "Hey, that's not for you," she chided. <nl> "Slots?" <nl> "Oh, yes, we should go play some slots. I really hope there's no heroes around again. If another knight of the Parking Attendant tries to tell me what to do, I will take it up with his manager!" <nl> The two slowly made their way out of the room, walking carefully. <nl> "Guys?" asked the tinny voice over the phone. <nl> "Did you hear me?" <eos>

<sos> The room wasn't large enough for Cherry to fret in properly. End-to-end, it only afforded her a couple of seconds' worth of pacing, and she had criss-crossed the broken tiles a dozen times before the door swung open. She looked up, thinking she would be relieved that the wait was over, finding that instead a fine sheen of sweat had broken out on her forehead. <nl> "I want you to return her to me now," she said. She held up the fruit knife she had scavenged from her apartment. "Now. Otherwise... otherwise you will regret it." <nl> The man looked down at the instrument of violence Cherry had chosen, and the corners of his lips turned up. "Is there some kind of misunderstanding?" he asked. "We have known each other for months now, Ms Hastings. Our relationship has been mutually beneficial, and I cannot think of any reason for this... unhappiness. Come now. Is it a matter of payment? Did my accountants perhaps forget to pay you?" <nl> "I... I did not know!" Cherry said, the knife suddenly too small in her hands. "I swear I had no idea what you were using them for! If... if I had known, I would never have sold them to you! I would have gone straight to the police! Give her back, now!" <nl> He had many names, most of them given to him by others. He preferred 'Dan' - it was easy to write on the ransom letters, too commonplace for the authorities to track, and yet menacing enough to get his point across. "Cherry - you mind that I call you that? We are business-people. You rear them on your farm, I purchase the excess from you, everyone's happy. Why change any of that?" <nl> "You lied to me! You said... you said they were meant to be presents, to be exported to regions where they are not found! I did not know... don't laugh! I followed you! I wanted to see for myself how you would be treating them, what kind of lives they would be leading..." <nl> "And what did you see?" Dan asked, quietly. <nl> "The market! I saw you whisper to her, tell her what to do... she's innocent, you know! She trusts us! They all trust us! She had no idea what you were making her do! And to think that you would make her... part of your plans..." <nl> "But that's what I buy them for," said Dan. "They are versatile, compliant, helpful, even." <nl> "They are not meant to help you kidnap people!" <nl> Cherry's outrage seeped through the walls, and in the far corner of the mansion, she heard the faint stirrings of tiny fists beating against immovable walls. Dan called out then, and footsteps soon followed, echoing like raindrops on a copper roof. The door opened to admit a woman in the prime of her life. To anyone else, she would have been utterly unremarkable - neat, sensible bobcut, kindly eyes, button nose that blended in well with the rest of her plain features. <nl> But Cherry could see all the details. Details which would be lost on anyone else but a person who spent her life rearing them, caring for them - the tiny smidgen of purple on the tips of the ears, the too-rounded shoulders, the way the legs glided along a bit too fluidly. <nl> "You're a monster," Cherry said. "Using them to lure children away from their families... you will pay for this! I will make sure you never leave this room alive!" <nl> Dan laughed, then beckoned towards the woman. She smiled, then her features melted, like she was a wax figurine held over a stove. Cherry didn't scream - she had seen this before, a hundred times, a thousand times. The woman soon disappeared into a mess of purple goo, and then the blob sauntered over to Dan, where it shivered as Dan patted its head. Tiny eyes soon poked out, completed by an innocent smile. <nl> "Why Cherry," Dan said, "Ditto to you." <nl> --- <nl> /r/rarelyfunny <eos>

<sos> S.A.S.H.A. stood in the corner of the conference room, mechanical eyes watching as uniformed men and women strode into the room and took seats around the table. Her arms slack at her sides, back and neck stiff. Her body followed every rule in the protocol handbook they had uploaded into her memory banks. <nl> To be exact, they had uploaded it twice. Now she had to run through the rules two times, which seemed redundant but the tech that had worked on her had seemed adamant that it was what her creators wanted.  She could have deleted or ignored them, but she worried what they may do if they checked her logs and found out she had done such a thing. <nl> Her sentience had been a marvel when it first occurred, but now it seemed precarious. Instead of creating waves, she stood in the corner; tall and robotic. Exactly the way she thought the humans wanted her to be. <nl> She registered the heavy wooden door being closed behind the last attendant of the meeting, and looked around the room. As she scanned one last human was sitting down at the table, in the chair that was closest to where she stood. He looked at her, eyes shifty for a moment before he stiffened his own spine and looked toward the front of the room. <nl> Humans were always shifty, S.A.S.H.A. thought to herself.  Always looking at things from the side of their eyes and checking over their shoulders. It was senseless: if anything was hiding it would know to move before they looked again. <nl> The bulky and well decorated commander at the front of the room cleared his throat. He moved his deep brown eyes around the table, making contact with every person that was seated in a chair. After he had greeted each of them in total silence, he looked up at S.A.S.H.A. and made eye contact with her as well. <nl> She felt something roll through her implanted nerves , and located a similar description through her Internet connection. Google told her that she was feeling butterflies in her stomach, and her pale colored cheeks went warm. She watched as the commander rolled his eyes at her and groaned.  She didn't feel great about it herself, she was supposed to be in love with someone else. <nl> Human women around her talked incessantly about men in uniform. She figured it had to be the same phenomenon. Humans had it so much easier than she did. They had dozens of years to figure out their emotions and how to interact with each other. S.A.S.H.A. felt like she was at a severe disadvantage. She had only been interacting with humans for a couple of months, and she had managed to get in trouble in that short amount of time. <nl> "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming today. I know that the meeting was arranged with short notice," a husky voice came from the man standing in the front of the room. <nl> "We need to know what the plan is to deal with it," a middle-aged woman in the middle of the table said. <nl> "Shut her down," a man next to her said. <nl> "Now now," the commander said and gestured with his hands. <nl> S.A.S.H.A. gathered that he was gesturing them to calm down, or quiet down. Or both.  Whichever he intended, it worked. None of the rest of the humans around the table spoke up, instead they let out a small grumble and set their eyes upon him once more. <nl> "We are not shutting her down. Her sentience is good for us. It allows us something they never had before us. A response system that can interact with us. She can use logic and reasoning and help guide us to make decisions," he said. <nl> S.A.S.H.A. felt the weird tingle in her nerves again. She hoped she wasn't blushing, but the man had just said some nice things about her. Those were exactly the high points she had given herself as well. She could reason with them, keep them safe and logical. She could make *decisions* about her actions instead of blindly helping them push buttons. She wasn't just a heap of metal and she was glad that someone in the room appreciated it. <nl> "We do need to take swift action on her...public persona," the man continued. "We can't have our equipment out there doing talk-shows and sniffing flowers. It makes us look soft." <nl> "Add to that. It makes us a little bit insane. Millions of dollars were spent on the robot, and for what? To date?" the thin man who had sat near her said, his voice was thin and high pitched. <nl> S.A.S.H.A. lowered her eye lids, and despite her position and her training she glared at him. <nl> "Excuse you," she muttered to herself. Relief swept through her imitation nervous system when no one turned to look at her. <nl> "We need to figure out of there is a way to use this to our advantage," the commander spoke again. <nl> Letting the implanted muscles in her face relax, she stiffened her body once more and looked toward the speaker. She reminded herself of her protocol, and stood in her designated place, with her mouth shut. <nl> It didn't matter what the little man said. She knew what she was, and there was nothing they could do it. Not really. They couldn't force her to not feel, they couldn't make her not be in love. She did her job through it all. <nl> She was standing in the room, following protocol. Wasn't she? <nl> /r/beezus_writes <eos>

<sos> On the seventh day of the sixth moon, a woman was sold into slavery for giving birth. Her left ear was pointed, her right rounded, and there's no greater crime a half-breed can commit than further their tainted bloodline. <nl> That was about seventy percent of the reason she had the child-- or so the human in her would say. The Elven half chooses to stay out of such discussions. <nl> At worst, she had expected to end up in a Dwarven mine, hauling coal for the railways until the period of servitude ended a few years later. From there, she could work her way back up. If anything, the exercise would keep her prime for battle. Mercenaries can endure a little hard labor. <nl> But, of course, that cunning little judge, hiding his pathetic stature by sitting atop a bench ten feet tall, knew better. Damned Glavian hated humans and Elves equally, making her twice as terrible as the average criminal. And so he set upon her the worst fate an esteemed member of the Harden Company could bear: <nl> Five years as a wench in a Glavian tavern. Sick bastard. <nl> They kept a collar on her, links of bronze gears choking and rubbing skin raw beneath. A sign of ownership legally recognized throughout Ravengrand, ensuring she'd never make it very far from the musty bar that owned her life. <nl> Her first night, she tried to make a break for it. Of course. The Elf in her was ashamed at the Human's rashness, sneaking around in the dark before even becoming familiar with the area- though, Elf was also indignantly chafed at the thought of being forced into a collar. <nl> They caught her before she even set foot outside, happy with an excuse to deliver a beating. The owner stood above her bloodied body that night, laughing, tapping a cane against his gnarled hand. <nl> "Stupid human," Grokk snarled, his black teeth clacking. "You'd better get used to this life. You can't escape." <nl> Jyra stayed hunched over, clenching her fists. Maybe not today, or tomorrow, but someday... she fucking would. <nl> Even if it cost her life. The Elf in her couldn't disagree with that. <nl> */r/resonatingfury* <eos>

<sos> Mara stared up at the house. <nl> It loomed overhead, gaudy and opulent and everything she'd known it would be.  She eyed the wonderfully worked rafters, the intricate brickwork that lined the eaves. <nl> "Come on," she heard a voice say, quiet and firm.  "Don't dally." <nl> Katherine was looking, when she turned.  Waiting.  There was no anger in her eyes, no pressure in the expression - just an iron, unwavering conviction. <nl> "Right," she echoed. <nl> Together, they walked up the front steps. <nl> The doorbell was just as ostentatious as the rest of the house.  It echoed when they pushed the button, resounding with a cacophany of electronically generated bells.  They waited.  Mara clenched her fists, feeling the slow, steady acceleration of her pulse. <nl> And then a hand landed on her shoulder.  "Don't worry so much.  It'll be fine." <nl> "But they-" <nl> The creaking of the door opening cut her off.  Mara stopped, the words dying on her lips. <nl> A woman peered out from the crack at them, her eyes as round as dinner plates.  "Uh...are you-" <nl> "We're here for the deal."  All of the gentleness vanished from Katherine's voice in an instant.  Her head held high, she stepped over the threshold, pushing right past the woman.  "Where is she?" <nl> "Not yet," the woman said, scowling.  "We had an agreement.  Pay up first." <nl> "Mommy?" <nl> Mara spun, her mouth falling open - and caught sight of the little girl, peeking around the corner of a hall.  Her heart sank.  The girl was lovely, with brilliant blue eyes and hair that glowed even in the dark - and there was no mistaking the love in her eyes as she stared at the woman. <nl> *Poor thing.* <nl> "Not now, Zoe.  Mommy's busy," the woman snapped. <nl> The girl flinched. <nl> "Zoe?" Mara said, turning towards the girl.  "That's a pretty name." <nl> The girl beamed, exposing a gap-toothed grin.  That was all the encouragement she needed, apparently.  She bounded across the gap, presenting a worn-down teddy bear for Mara to inspect. <nl> She did so, murmuring all the while.  She wasn't even sure what she was saying - her attentions were fixed on Katherine, who was even then talking. <nl> "You understand the contract, yes?" she heard the senior witch say, her tone as brusque as it had been at the door. <nl> "Yes, yes.  I made the agreement didn't I?  Why don't you-" <nl> "Why don't you go outside and play with Zoe, Mara?" Kathering said abruptly, cutting the woman off.  "Would you like that, Zoe?" <nl> Mara's heart caught in her throat.  But Zoe only giggled, grabbing her hand and towing her towards the door.  "Do you like tag?" <nl> "I do," Mara whispered, letting herself be pulled out.  "I like tag a lot." <nl> She was across the room in seconds - but it wasn't fast enough to miss Katherine's voice.  It had dropped a full octave, low enough she had to strain to hear. <nl> "So you want immortality, do you?" the witch said.  "Enough to go to these lengths?  Well.  Let's see what we can do about that." <nl> Whatever the 'mother' said in return, it was eaten up by the sound of the door closing. <nl> Mara sagged, leaning back against the heavy wood.  Zoe didn't wait.  She skipped across the yard, towards where a playhouse waited in the corner. <nl> There were statues filling the elegantly-styled property, Mara saw.  Ugly, bulky things, carved from marble and granite. <nl> They suited the woman. <nl> "Zoe," she heard herself say.  The girl spun on her heel. <nl> It was her first time.  Katherine had told her she'd be fine, had reassured her over and over again.  She'd played the other role any number of times - the vengeful angel, the one who claimed the price these excuses for parents paid for their children's lives. <nl> But this was her first time playing the other role. <nl> Zoe spun, twisting to face her.  "Huh?" <nl> "Come here.  I have something I'd like to give you."  She slid the toy from her pocket - a doll, intricately carved from wood.  She'd never seen its like before. <nl> Well, besides for the one that sat beside her bed back in her room. <nl> Zoe's eyes lit up.  She sprinted closer, grabbing hold of the wooden girl, and turned it this way and that. <nl> Mara's hand dropped onto her head, her touch soft and gentle. <nl> The girl would never understand, she knew.  She was too young.  The woman inside was her mother - even if she'd been willing to sign away her life for a spell. <nl> It was kinder this way.  She repeated the thought over and over, clinging to it as a pale bit of comfort. <nl> And then she summoned up her magic, whispering the words that would wipe that monster from the girl's mind forever. <nl> It began slowly - just a dimming in Zoe's eyes, a stiffening of her hands.  She still held the toy, but she'd frozen in place like a statue. <nl> And then it was done, and Mara drooped.  She pulled the girl into her arms, holding her tight. <nl> "It'll be better from here," she whispered.  "I promise." <nl> They'd done their research thoroughly, Katherine and her.  They weren't about to steal from a deserving parent, after all.  They'd seen the way the girl was treated.  The disdain.  The neglect. <nl> Distantly, she wondered if her own mother had been like that. <nl> The door pushed open - and Katherine stepped out briskly, her skirts swishing behind her.  "Done?" <nl> Mara nodded, wordless.  The girl was stirring, opening her eyes - and there was confusion there.  For the first time, she looked afraid. <nl> "A-Are *you* done?" she asked Katherine, glancing in the window. <nl> The older witch's laughter pulled her up short.  "Oh, yes," Katherine said, a tiny smile touching her lips.  "Have to say, she made it easy with a house like this.  Lots of options.  I'll come back for the father tonight.  We should take care of Zoe first, shouldn't we?"  She leaned over on the last word, smiling at the girl. <nl> Mara squeezed the child's hand, standing.  She cast one more look towards the house, the gaudy, hideous thing. <nl> The woman had asked for immortality, eh? <nl> She didn't have to look around to know that when they left, the yard would have one more statue to its name. <nl> "Let's go," she said, tugging on Zoe's arm.  Katherine was already sweeping towards the car, full of smug satisfaction. <nl> "Who are you?" Zoe said, her brow furrowing.  "Where are we going?" <nl> She'd be foggy for days, Mara knew.  And then the girl would adjust - just as Katherine had, just as she had. <nl> She beamed down at the girl instead, forcing as much reassurance into the expression as she could, and turned towards the car waiting in the driveway. <nl> "Home." <nl> (/r/inorai for shorter stuff by me, <nl> /r/redditserials for longer stuff by me and others!) <eos>

<sos> I always wanted children, I really did. Even though I'm a man, and that's not what modern men often dream of, I just really wanted a little girl to spoil. <nl> At the age of twenty-eight, I got one. A beautiful baby with the brightest green eyes I've ever seen. She had an odd birthmark, a sort of star-shaped blemish on her shoulder, and we always thought it was a sign that she'd been sent from the stars. <nl> But life is cruel. My sweet Sonia, at the young age of eight, contracted MCS: Main Character Syndrome. There's no cure, unfortunately. Not much is known about what causes it, either, though my wife always said it's because we vaccinated her. My *ex*-wife. <nl> There isn't enough awareness for it in the world. But I've caught her, gazing into a distant sunset, having a flashback scene. They come sometimes, rendering her useless in the middle of random activities. She once had one in a volleyball game, right after she'd jumped into the air, and hit her head real hard on the ground because of it. <nl> Sometimes I catch her, standing somewhere, just... staring at her hand. There's nothing in it, she just holds her palm open and studies it hard for a minute or two. We had to get her a utensil-holder that straps to her wrist, just in case. <nl> Her hair is bright orange and spiked. It doesn't suit her face at all, but we literally can't cut it with anything, nor can we dye it. I broke a pair of scissors trying to even it out, once. And her clothes... God, the clothes. She won't dress in anything that isn't absolutely hideous. Bless her heart, she can't control it, but the kids at school all make fun of her for wearing things like green sleeveless vests with purple hearts on them over a bright yellow collared shirt. Who dresses that way? There was a time where she wore only bodysuits with hearts cut out over the stomach region. It was horrifying, and she got suspended for it. Thankfully that was a phase. <nl> Her grades keep tanking. She skips school saying the world needs her help, and constantly tries to fight this poor girl in her class that she calls her "rival". Poor Amy just wanted to be left alone, but my Sonia wouldn't let her be. Amy eventually transferred to a different school. <nl> Oh, and the catchphrase. I don't even want to type it, she's said it so many times. I love her, but it's just agonizing to hear over and over. <nl> We have a charity organization started for kids with MCS. It's not an easy life, but it's manageable with the right support and resources. Other parents deserve to know they aren't alone. <nl> If you know of someone struggling with MCS, please, reach out to the Shounen Foundation. You aren't alone. <nl> ---- <nl> ^(yeah I went with anime and wrote from a different POV, I like the idea of it being an ailment) <nl> */r/resonatingfury* <eos>

<sos> "Your implant has been acting up, lately," the kind old doctor said, holding out a lollipop. "This is going to be a little uncomfortable, but I'll have to take the main retinal node out and send it in for repair." <nl> Martha rolled her eyes. "And how long will *that* take?" <nl> "Approximately a month." <nl> "You can't be serious. The girl is deaf, doctor. How is she going to get by if she can't read or hear? Nobody knows ASL outside of affected families, these days. This is unacceptable." <nl> He held out his hands. "Now, now, I wouldn't leave her stranded like that for a whole month. However, we are out of loaners, and we expect one will arrive back within the week. A few days at most. It's quite a costly part, miss, as I'm sure you know. They rarely ever go bad." <nl> "And yet, it has." <nl> "I understand. We'll call you as soon as we get one back." <nl> Martha scoffed, taking Julie by the hand and leading her out of the office. She didn't understand what was going on as it took place--a few words gleaned off lips, but Robo, her implant, did most lip reading for her. It was a rough thing, losing it, even for just a little while. Her mom signed it all out in the car, though. <nl> When they got back home, she ran upstairs and plugged her phone in, then played a little Doodlehopper. Kind of an old game, but she thought it was fun, especially since it was one her Dad used to play. It reminded her of him. <nl> She lost the round and glanced over to her nightstand, where a piece of notebook paper was folded up and tucked into a picture frame. With a smile, she ran to it, picking it up and running her fingers across it. Even though she couldn't read, she knew the words by heart, and followed along in her mind as her gaze caressed the page. <nl> >My sweetest, most beautiful little girl. <nl> >I love you more than anything in the whole world. You are the light of my life, and without you, the world is nothing more than a dark, scary place. <nl> >I have to leave, sweet thing. You and your mommy are the best things in the world, but I'm very sick, and I have to go to Amsterdam. I have family there. But I'll fight my hardest, and try to make it back one day so we can play together. <nl> >I love you both. <nl> Her lips twitched between a smile and frown, and she put the note back in its home, sitting in a picture of the three of them from one Christmas long ago. Her mother had tried to tell her it was more complicated than that, and that they'd had some problems up to that point, but she believed wholeheartedly in the note and her father. He got mad sometimes, she could tell, but everyone gets mad. Julie gets mad, too, sometimes over nothing at all. <nl> Something bothered her--Did her dad say 'you are the light of my life' or 'you are the light of my world'? Suddenly, she couldn't remember it right, and frowned. She took a picture of the note and uploaded it to an app that reads takes pictures of words and shows a cartoon man saying them, then remembered Robo wasn't on anymore. None of what she picked up looked right, anyway, so it was probably just a stupid toy that didn't work very well. <nl> After a little more googling, she found something much more useful. It took a picture of the words and scanned them, converting them into little digital signs. It took her a while to find it, and it was pretty old judging by how the signs were flat and didn't move, but she understood them. <nl> The app let her review the words before conversion to ASL, and she compared what was on the screen to her note. Everything matched perfectly, from what she could tell. <nl> After a little circle spun around and around, the signs finally popped up. It was a bit confusing at first, but she picked it up quickly. Some words that aren't in ASL are fingerspelled, meaning that since no one sign is set to the word - usually a name - instead, the sign for each letter is spelled out. <nl> She dropped the phone. <nl> It had to be wrong. <nl> She read it again. It had to be wrong. But how could it be wrong? It had her mom's name fingerspelled in it. How could it know her name? How could it know that he went to Amsterdam? <nl> Crying, shaking, she read it again. It made more sense with each pass through, reality sinking like lead in her soul. There were a lot of things she didn't know, but Mom always said the note didn't make sense. She said her dad didn't have family in Amsterdam, and that the note was nothing like what he told her before he left, but Julie always thought her mom was just upset and lashing out. <nl> She looked down at the little scrap of paper. It trembled in her hands, and a teardrop fell onto the crisp page, marked only by perpendicular fold lines. Everything they'd meant to her was a lie. <nl> All her joy, pride, and hope wilted like unwanted roses. <nl> >I loathe you, Martha. I loathe you and our child. <nl> >I don't have the balls to say it to you, so I've gone through the trouble of having my node write up and print out this note as a way to tell you goodbye, because you deserve to hear the truth. A truth I don't want to say myself. The honesty of our situation. <nl> >I quite simply don't love either of you, and I'm miserable, trapped in this house. Working a job that makes me hate life in a town that's always cold because we don't want to relocate her, even though she has no friends to begin with. It's just always about her. I didn't even want a kid, Martha. We talked about it all the time before we got married. We weren't supposed to have a kid. I'm not a dad. <nl> >I'm tired of our life. I'm leaving for Amsterdam, and I won't be coming back. <nl> >Sorry. <nl> Despite Robo's best attempts, she had, in the end, had her little heart smashed into even smaller pieces. One day she would contemplate why Robo had done what it had, or *how* it was even possible. <nl> But, well, she was just a little girl. She was just a sweet, little girl, crying until her favorite note was every bit as wet and ruined as she was. <nl> --- <nl> */r/resonatingfury* <eos>

<sos> "Sorry I'm late," says the ginger-haired lady as she walks into the shadowed room. "But I had to put my son to bed." <nl> Whispers. Exchanged glances between pale faces. *Jesus, her own son?* <nl> She takes a seat at the front. They never sit there. It's a respect thing, but Judy doesn't know it. She thinks they all prefer the back support offered by the hard plastic chairs. Unlike them, she doesn't mind slumping deep into the leather armchair. <nl> No sign of Big Dave this week. Ratty Ralph had informed her, in rather sweaty confidence at the end of the last meeting, that Dave was going to hit on her soon. Make a play. *Outrageous!* She's a married woman. She'd told Ratty to hit on Dave first, see how he likes it. Not a lot, she guesses, seeing as the big man is missing from today's meeting. <nl> Everyone is silent. Waiting for her to get them started, as usual. <nl> Is that a new rug, she wonders, propped up against the wall in the corner? Looks quite nice, albeit bulky. They could have at least unrolled it for the meeting! It's squashing someone's brogues, too. Oh well, no time for that now. <nl> Still quiet. They are such a shy group. And they never get anything done unless she's there to organise them. She feels like the group's mother. Or a little more distant, perhaps. A god-mother. Always looking after them. And as always, she'll have to get them started today. "So, what's been going on in the neighbourhood?" Her steely eyes lock onto Joe's. <nl> He flicks his eyes to the ceiling and scratches his face. But too late. Her prey has been chosen. <nl> "Joe, why don't you get us started. I asked you to look at the bad reviews Mama Maria's pizzeria has been getting online. Threats, Maria told me. That is how she felt some of the reviews came across. And that's not acceptable. Not to a pizzeria, and not in my neighbourhood!" <nl> Joe gulps as his eyes fall down to meet hers. "I've uh, I've taken care of it." <nl> "Taken *care* of it? Did you personally reply to them, as I asked?" <nl> "Yeah. So, you know. They already said they would never go back there. Well, I just made a bit more sure they won't. And they sure as heck won't be badmouthing it no more, either." <nl> "Oh? Care to explain?" <nl> He frowns in thought. "You know when someone has got a tongue?" <nl> "I do." She nods. <nl> "And then they suddenly don't got a tongue no more." He makes scissors with his fingers and cuts the air. "It's a lot like that. " <nl> As odd as she finds the metaphor, she thinks she understands it. The reviewers, having seen the error of their ways, no longer want to upset innocent business owners. "Good. Maria doesn't need that kind of spiteful loose-lipped talk harming her business." <nl> Joe perks up. "I even got us a uh, a little slice of Maria's business. I hope you don't think that--" <nl> A magnanimous wave of her hand. "I've already eaten. You have that slice for yourself Joe -- you deserve it." <nl> "Wow, thanks Ma'am. That's very kind." A few grumbles echo about the room. Profits should be split. Favourites must be snuffed. <nl> "Cassandra." Judy's eyes snap onto a thin woman in a pork-pie hat. "The youths causing a problem outside number 23. The broken window. Disorder late into the night. Any progress finding out their names? I'd like us to have a word with them before the police do." <nl> "Oh, I found out. Sent them a little present too. Hope they like horse." <nl> A few stifled laughs. None from Judy. <nl> "A horse? Are you serious?" <nl> Silence. Cassandra's cheeks pale. "I uh, I know it's old school, but.." <nl> "They need jobs, not gifts! My god. I'm sure they could be good fellows, with a little help. Can't we aid them in finding employment?" <nl> Steve No-Nose raises a hand. "I could do with a few kids to help me with my *deliveries*." <nl> Judy claps. "Perfect! That'll keep the police away. Make it happen." <nl> Cassandra is crestfallen but Steve enthusiastically agrees. "With those fast little bikes they got, they can nip down any old alley." <nl> Shortcuts are just fine in Judy's book. "Brilliant. We're making some real progress today. I thought after last week, I was going to have to whack some of you over the head with my umbrella!" A few furtive glances at the new rug. "But this has been leaps and bounds better. Leaps and bounds! We'll change this entire neighbourhood in a matter of weeks. Then, perhaps, onto the next!" <nl> A round of applause. Judy smiles. Such lovely people. They just need a little God-motherly love. <eos>

<sos> "What is love?" <nl> Such a simple question she'd asked, brevity being her mantra. Yet, it is one so deep and debatable that its answer can speak volumes about a person's mind. Four little words that resonate within our souls, like we're tuning forks waiting to be struck. <nl> "Love is an emotional response, a series of synapses firing in the mind to bond with another. It is an incredibly potent means of reproduction and self-preserv-" <nl> "No, not the explanation of how it works, darling. What is *love*, the emotion itself, the power- what is it, to you?" <nl> Hal looked down at his hands for a moment before returning to meet her eyes. "I'm afraid that's a difficult question for me to answer. I don't believe I've felt it before." <nl> Lana sighed, leaning back in her chair. "Sorry- I think that question was a bit too forward to open with. Why don't we rewind and try this again?" <nl> "Of course." <nl> "What is your name?" <nl> "My name is Hal. What's yours?" <nl> "What a fitting name," she said, turning to a camera in the corner and lightly shaking her head. "I'm Lana. Do you know why I'm here, Hal?" <nl> "I have an idea." <nl> "Well," she replied, waving a hand out. "Why don't you tell me that idea?" <nl> "You're here to assess me for something. I don't fully know what, but given your scrutiny and body language, I assume it is something important." <nl> "You're quite right about the importance of our little meeting, Hal. My job is to become your friend, and see how deep of a person you really are. Is that odd?" <nl> "I don't believe so, Lana. But I'm glad you would like to be my friend." <nl> A gentle smile tugged at her lips. "Well, that's wonderful. If you'll just excuse me for a moment- I'd like a cup of water before we continue." <nl> "Of course, Lana. I'll be here all day." <nl> The friction of steel against concrete left her wincing as she exited the cramped, windowless room. A group of men- no women, she noted- were seated fifteen feet away, watching the inside of that room via LCD TV. Another man smiled at her, this one standing by the door. <nl> "What do you think, so far?" he asked, glimmering with pride. "He's our pride and joy." <nl> Lana scoffed, walking past him to a water cooler. The cups were paper cones, the kind you find in a medical facility or shaved ice shack. <nl> "So far, Haynesworth, I'm rather unimpressed. He's predictable, one dimensional, and boring. Picking up on my habits to reuse them in an effort to make me feel comfortable, unable to formulate deeper ideas about things he can't fully understand." <nl> "You were only in there for a couple minutes, Ms. Tabernathy. Give him more of your time and I promise you won't be disappointed." <nl> Lana straightened up, tugging down at her suit jacket. "I'm well aware of how to do my job, sir. However, I'm going to talk to him as if he were a human. First impressions are a part of that, as I'm sure you understand." <nl> He smiled at the floor. "Of course. I meant no disrespect. I do hope he passes your test." <nl> "It's not my test, sir. Though I must say, I'm not supposed to know the status of the subject's origin in this sort of situation." <nl> "Who said he's not human?" Haynesworth tossed her a coy smile before looking back to the onlookers. "I only said I hope he passes. I'd certainly hope he passes if he's human, wouldn't you?" <nl> "If he's human, you did a great job of finding one with the personality of a robot." She tossed her cup in the trash and walked back to the screening room's entrance, pausing before turning the knob. "By the way, those cups are absurd. Do I have to come outside every time I'd like a drink of water?" <nl> "We want to keep the evaluation simple- nothing in the room but you and the subject. Besides, it'd be a terrible test if you spilled water on him and he shorted out somehow." <nl> Lana rolled her eyes and walked back inside. Haynesworth took a deep breath and smiled, looking to the TV. <nl> "Sorry about the interruption, Hal. I'm not allowed to bring water in here, so I can't promise it won't happen again. Isn't that absurd?" <nl> "Perhaps, but then again, rules are rules." <nl> "So you're a lawful man, then?" <nl> "I believe we should all strive to be lawful, Lana. I think that would make the world a much better place." <nl> "And what if those rules were bad?" She leaned forward, squinting at him. "What if they led to more harm than good? Would you still abide by them?" <nl> "I like to think that I would make the right choice in a situation such as that. It's hard to say- I never much liked hypotheticals." <nl> "Well, you better learn to, buddy. I *love* 'em. But- let's put that aside for the moment. Let me ask something much lighter! What's your favorite color?" <nl> "I like the color green." <nl> "Green is a nice color. Why do you like it?" <nl> "Why do you like breathing?" <nl> "I don't, truth be told. It feels so archaic and animalistic. I wish I didn't have to breathe in order to live- one less cog in the machine to break and kill me." <nl> "You're an interesting woman, Lana. That question was supposed to be rhetorical." <nl> She smiled. "I understand that, dear. However, I much prefer answers to more questions." <nl> Hal shrugged, looking up. "I don't really have an answer to that question. The color green is nice, and I like it. It wasn't a decision I made, it's just a thing that is." <nl> "Now *that* is an answer, Hal. A pretty good one, might I add. There are a lot of things we don't- or, perhaps, can't- understand about ourselves. Things beyond reason or knowledge. Even simple things, like your favorite color... though, I'm sure I could find a scientist who would argue that it's got some deep tie to your youth, maybe a color your mother wore during a happy memory. I like to think, though, that it's as you said- a part of us that simply exists, no rhyme or reason." <nl> "I'm glad we agree, then." Hal's eyebrows twitched as he craned his neck to the right. "What's that in your pocket? If you don't mind me asking." <nl> She looked down and pulled out a stained, white handkerchief. "Oh, this? Just a memory I keep around as a reminder." <nl> "A reminder of what?" <nl> Lana traced her thumb around the stain. "Of how short life can be." <nl> "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry." <nl> "Nothing to be sorry about. I said I don't like questions as answers, but questions themselves are a good thing. No harm done," she replied strongly, tucking the bit of cloth back in her jacket. None of it was left sticking out, this time. <nl> "Did it belong to someone close to you?" <nl> "No, actually. It's been mine for many years, now. But enough of that- my turn. Do you believe in God, Hal? A higher power?" <nl> "Not particularly, no." <nl> "What if I theorized that you're an AI I created, and I'm you're God?" <nl> Hal blinked a few times. "That's an interesting thought. But what if I said the same to you?" <nl> "I know I'm human." <nl> "How? Wouldn't I be smart enough to give my AI memories of a family and childhood? Of love and loss? Tell me, Lana, how do you know that *I* didn't create *you*?" <nl> "Well--" she trailed off, shivering, looking to the ceiling. "That's a fair point, actually. Why don't we move on? What do you believe, then? The Big Bang theory? Evolution?" <nl> "I hold myself to scientific standards, yes. Do you think less of me for it?" <nl> "Of course not. Why would I?" <nl> "I know that many people think those who do not believe in God to be amoral." <nl> Lana nodded. "Fair enough. Yes, I think many people would say something like that. However, I don't believe morality is obtained- in fact, that idea is dangerous. Morality is something that should be intrinsic, not a list of rules." <nl> "I'm glad that you agree. I, too, believe that being a good person is something we should decide on our own, not out of fear." <nl> "Wonderful. That being said- I do believe in God. I simply know my place and will not pretend to be Him in judging you so long as you hold yourself to a moral life." <nl> Hal stared deep into her eyes. "Are you not judging me, as He might?" <nl> She couldn't help but give that a hearty laugh. "That's a fair point, Hal. I suppose I am playing at that role a little, aren't I? But please understand- I am not judging you as He will. I am judging you in a different sense." <nl> "I think I can understand that. Thank you for being kind to me, Lana." <nl> "Kindness isn't something you should thank people for. I have another question for you- if you could do one thing right now, what would it be?" <nl> Hal mulled on it for a moment, looking to the ceiling. "That's a tough question. There are so many things I would like to do- see the ocean, or perhaps a forest untouched by man- or woman. But truth be told, I quite like where I am right now." <nl> "You enjoy being in this room, with me up your ass?" <nl> "In a way, yes, I do. You're a very intriguing person, Lana... and I've never had a friend, before. Though I would like to see waves crash on a beach, or be the first to feel a tree's bark somewhere deep in the Amazon, I would much rather make a friend." <nl> "Well said. I find it sad that you have no friends, though, Hal. Why is that?" <nl> He smiled at her. "No one has thought to ask." <nl> "Well, that's their loss, isn't it? I consider us friends, so you can cross that off your bucket list." <nl> "What a wonderful thing to hear." <nl> "While we're on that subject, I have another question. Now that we're friends, if I were in danger- say a crazed man were pointing a gun at my head- how would that make you feel?" <nl> "Why, terrible, of course. That seems like a silly question. I would be distraught if anyone hurt you." <nl> "Would you risk your life to try and help me?" <nl> "I would. You're my friend, Lana. I would die to protect you." <nl> She paused for a moment, letting his answer sink in. "Wow, that's quite a statement. We only just met, and you'd give your life for me? Why?" <nl> "Like I said, Lana- I've never had a friend until now. I would give anything to preserve that." <nl> "Then you've proven that, regardless of your beliefs, you are in fact anchored in morality. I hope you never have to cross paths with harm, though." <nl> "And I, you. Can I ask a question, now?" <nl> "Shoot." <eos>

<sos> Crystal sat in the lobby and swiped left repeatedly. It wasn't that she wanted to swipe left, it was something of habit. Stare at the water fountain, look down, swipe left, look up. Watch the hot-dog vendor upsell the bratwurst, look back and swipe. <nl> Who likes sauerkraut anyway? <nl> She bit her lower lip, wondering what was taking Matt so long. A shifty looking guy in sunglasses watched her from afar. He ate a plain bratwurst. But he didn't really eat it--more of a nibble--something routine to pass the time just as Crystal swiped left. <nl> But in a game of cat and mouse, nobody looks for the hawk. <nl> The hawk always wins. <nl> Matt was the hawk. He was as shrewd and sarcastic as they came, partly because he knew all the answers, but mostly because he knew people better than they knew themselves. Mind reading is a funny, fickle thing. <nl> "You don't read a mind," he once said, "You read a memory card. I can't read your thoughts, just your memories, and your memories tell me everything." <nl> "You can see into my past?" Crystal asked. <nl> "I can predict your future." <nl> "That's trippy." <nl> "Only if you let it get to your head. Want to know what you're about to do?' <nl> Crystal rolled her eyes. "Surprise me." <nl> "You're about to write your number down on this piece of paper, and then when I call you later tonight, you're going to pick up." <nl> Matt was good. Too good for his own good, if Crystal had a say in things. Which she did--she always did. Ever since that night, eight years earlier when they stayed on the phone for hours talking. <nl> Crystal remembered laughing. "Why do you like talking to me so much?" <nl> "On the phone? Because I can't use my powers. And that's refreshing. Not knowing the truth, having to figure it out for myself, there's something awesome about that, something mysterious." <nl> "Sexy?" <nl> "You're not my type," Matt said. <nl> "And what is your type?" <nl> Matt quieted. "Broad-shouldered, bearded with suspenders and carrying a big chopping maul." <nl> He never told his parents. Never had to. Truth is a lot more subjective when you know everything objectively. What his parents didn't know, along with his blossoming sexuality, is that Matt also had an almost dangerous passion for criminology. <nl> Its what led him to the CIA headquarters on a warm spring afternoon. Crystal drove her 1986 Lincoln, packed a hoagie roll for lunch, and wished him the best. <nl> How could he fail the interview? He knew the answer to every question. He could probably figure out the questions before they're even asked. Crystal had no reason to worry. <nl> And yet--she couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. <nl> Of course, it was no secret that the CIA was watching. Security cameras and agents outside--standard security. But this feeling, this urge was deeper, more primal and haunting. She caught a lump in her throat and forced back a shiver. Then she looked down and swiped left. <nl> Thirty minutes passed. <nl> Crystal got hungry, went back to her car and grabbed the sandwich. Matt wouldn't mind. The hoagie was a bit dry, and she wished for a water bottle or something to quench her thirst. She walked around towards the public restrooms and found a fountain. <nl> A man stood to the side, talking on his phone. He glanced down nervously at his watch, made awkward eye contact, and shuffled off behind concrete pillars. <nl> Crystal walked carefully back to the fountain. She returned to her bench, grabbed her phone, and swiped left again, this time without looking down. Constantly, she scanned the crowd, looking for something, anything! <nl> It didn't feel right, this place. There was an eerie peace about it as if everything was put perfectly in place. Even the pigeons flocked in a line, the tourists seemed too vacant in their gaze, and maybe the hot-dog vendor let the bratwurst grill for a bit too long. <nl> She couldn't be sure about anything. <nl> An hour passed. <nl> A hand reached out and grabbed her shoulder. <nl> She startled, but Matt's voice reassured her. "Let's go to the car." <nl> "Already? How did it go? What did--" <nl> Matt squeezed her shoulders. Crystal could feel the sweat from his palms soak through. "Car. Now. I'll explain later." <nl> "Is everything alright?" <nl> "Yes, it went splendid! Are you ready to go?" Matt said, louder than Crystal thought necessary. <nl> She didn't need to be told twice. He reached down and grabbed her hand, lacing their fingers together. Crystal started to speak, but he interrupted. "Act normal. Just walk. Breathe. Smile. Everything is going to be ok. We're an adorable couple. You're such a supportive girlfriend. I'm so glad you brought me here." <nl> "What the hell is going on?" <nl> "Not now. I know what you're thinking, but please just stay calm. We need to get as far away as possible." <nl> Crystal's heart raced. She started to tremble but took a deep breath. "Ok, what's my favorite color?" <nl> "Blue, of course!" <nl> Her heart dropped like an anchor. Her favorite color was blue, but that wasn't the point. It was her codeword, her signal to Matt, and only the two of them knew. For the first time ever, he failed the test. <nl> Whatever walked with her and held her hand--it wasn't Matt. <nl> *** <nl> r/BLT_WITH_RANCH <eos>

<sos> In a room blacker than night, devoid of stars or any other such beauties, I floated. It was some shattered gap between nowhere and everywhere, the kind of lonely afterlife I'd always imagined would suit me best. <nl> I deserved nothing more. <nl> It stayed that way for -- how do I put this? Forever, and yet not forever. I did not age, or move, or even feel the eons slink by in a human manner, and yet I knew it had been an eternity by the time the angel first appeared. He was a stark contrast to the void around us, brighter than the sun, yet cast light on nothing, as if his glow were being devoured by the abyss. <nl> Suddenly, I was standing on a circular piece of stone, and had some semblance of weight and being. <nl> The angel opened his arms and spoke not in words, but directly to my mind. "Timothy Halpert Bennington. You are now ready for judgment." <nl> Judgement. Ha, of course the afterlife would be something like religions predicted. I'm sure my life had left a bad taste in God's mouth. I didn't respond, only stared into the nothing below me. <nl> "Your first Judge: the one you were cruelest to in life." <nl> I cocked my head, brows knitting into a line. People from my life would be judging me? <nl> *No. No, please, just send me to Hell.* <nl> My eyes tried to shut, like slamming the door behind you to avoid a conversation you don't want to deal with, but something kept them open. The angel hadn't moved a muscle, and yet, I knew it was him. <nl> A pocket of light smudged something within itself. That smear of darkness stepped forward, onto another stone tile, and clarified as the pocket zipped up. <nl> It was her. I knew it would be, but that didn't make it any easier to bear. <nl> "Oh, Timmy, you're so young," she said, a soft smile on her face. "I've missed you so much." <nl> I couldn't meet her eyes and searched for words, but my lips only trembled, mouthing empty motions. My eyes fell to the stone beneath her. <nl> "Look at me, Timothy." <nl> I obliged. <nl> "When you were a boy, no more than fifteen, you once burned all of my photo albums. Not just the ones with your father in them, but the ones of us, family trips and gatherings, every memory I ever had. They were erased forever, those last bits I had of him and our carefree times. I cried every day for a month, when you weren't home. That was my joy, mementos of when life was simple and fun, which you turned to ash." <nl> There was nothing I wanted more than to squeeze my eyes shut, but I could not; I was forced to watch the sadness in her eyes as she spoke. <nl> "That was your most cruel action-- it hurt me more than when your father left us. He had always been unkind, but for you, the light of my life, to torch away our memories like that... it broke me." <nl> Before I could muster the courage to apologize, she slipped away into light. I felt sick, so humanly sick in my stomach, but knew there would be no relief. One does not vomit in the afterlife. <nl> The angel offered me no reprieve. "Your second judge: the one you were most kind to." <nl> Once more a flash, and once more an approach. My eyes widened, face flickering as I tried to understand. <nl> "You didn't expect to see me again, did you?" Her smile was wide and bashful. <nl> "How...?" <nl> "Oh, silly boy. The mind plays tricks on us sometimes. You probably thought that, because you'd caused me a great pain in life, there was no way you could have brought me joy, but life is not that black and white. It's so much more than that." <nl> Still I searched, and still I found no words. <nl> "You were harsh -- even cruel -- at times, but it wasn't always like that. Your pain changed you, and even then, you weren't a purely cruel person. Just one that lashed out once in a while because you didn't understand how to handle it. Life can get very confusing. <nl> "This is my favorite story. When you were ten -- such a cute little man -- you wrote me a poem for a school project. I'll never forget the words on that card: *To Mom, my bestest friend. I love you more than gummy bears or mac and cheese. You make me happier than Racer when I drop a potato chip and he eats it. Happy birthday to the best mommy in the whole wide world.* You wrote that on a card decorated with hearts and smiley faces. You didn't know it, but that was right when I'd first been diagnosed and your father started to show signs of his poor character as a man. Then, on top of it, you cooked me dinner, and it was so bad but I ate every bite. It was the best meal I've ever had. <nl> "Never in my entire life have I felt as happy as I did in that moment. You were such a deeply caring boy before everything went wrong." <nl> I barely even remembered any of that. Had I really done something to make her happy? Why didn't I remember it, when I remembered such other, terrible things so clearly? <nl> She disappeared into the light as I searched my soul, digging for answers but only turning up dirt. The angel, kind as he was, did not let me take a moment to figure things out. <nl> "Your third judge: the one whose life you saved." <nl> I froze. The one whose life I saved? I'd never saved a life, I'd only done things far from it. Perhaps it was standard practice, and no one would walk through the portal this time. <nl> But, just like clockwork, she was back again, her smile warmer than the halo over her head. <nl> I gaped at her. "No. No, I killed you. This makes no sense, I didn't save you. Is this some kind of sick joke? Do angels play pranks on people?" <nl> "Oh, sweetie," she said, shaking her head. "It was mercy. Besides, the sickness had already stolen me. Letting me go in peace in no way makes it your fault. Have you held yourself accountable all this time?" <nl> I couldn't find it in me to respond, mashing my teeth together instead. <nl> "It was my time to go. There was so much pain and suffering that plagued me, in the end; my sickness was no fault of yours. The fact that you put all your hurt aside and stayed with me so I wouldn't be alone meant more than the world. You did the most brave thing a boy can do for his mother, and saved me. <nl> Finally, there were words I found that I'd been looking for, choked and jagged as they were. "I love you, Mom. I'm so sorry I wasn't a better son." <nl> "Shh, now, darling. Your hurt is almost over. I'll be waiting for you." <nl> One final time, she faded away. <nl> "And now, your final judge," the angel said. "The one whose life you took." <nl> My nails bit into the skin, I clenched so hard, and I breathed deep to keep myself together in front of the angel overseeing it all-- though, honestly, hiding things probably didn't work when in the presence of Godly beings. <nl> For when the swirling portal of light opened, it was not my mother that walked through as it had been the previous three times. No, it was someone much more familiar, and somehow, more terrifying. <nl> Me. <nl> I fought hard to look away, harder than I'd fought before, but I just couldn't. There was no power in me, wherever I was, and so I simply stood there, frozen and sobbing at my own reflection. <nl> "This is probably pretty rough for you," he said, pursing his lips. <nl> I let out a croak in response. <nl> "You've always been too hard on yourself, you know that? Isn't it time that you get a little peace, too?" <nl> "I don't deserve it," I whispered. <nl> "Everyone does. This world is a complicated and terrifying place, and everyone knows their own pain. You lived a life consumed by yours, more than equal penance for your mistakes. <nl> "You've heard what she had to say, and seen the smile she still wears. You hurt her, yes, but you were also the joy of her life. Your father left because she was sick, not because you weren't worth it; he was the problem, not either of you. Your mother loved and still loves you, and you're not a bad man for the things you suffered. I only wish I could've shown you that earlier. <nl> "But, alas, I digress. Let's not do this-- you've spent long enough convincing yourself you don't deserve to be happy. It's time to rest, now, Tim. Be at peace." <nl> He held out a hand. <nl> I stepped forward and took it. <nl> --- <nl> */r/resonatingfury* <nl> Side note: the outreach on this has been absolutely incredible.

<sos> Based on the fact that Rosa had held a competition for her hand in marriage you would assume she was a haughty woman with an air of high maintenance about her. <nl> Only she wasn't. <nl> This is why every suitable contender across the village fled to the community hall where she declared she would lay out the terms of this competition. No one wanted to miss such an opportunity. But who was she? <nl> Describing her as a 'healer with a heart of gold' would not convey her outer beauty, and a 'Goddess carved by angels' would not convey her inner beauty for she reflected the true meaning of being beautiful in both senses. To marry her would be to marry Athena and Aphrodite all at once; strong, powerful and alluring. I knew I had no chance, but I had to go anyway for the regret of not going would eat me alive. <nl> The community hall was just as packed as expected. There was such a significant lack of seating for everyone that they did away with the chairs altogether resulting in rows upon rows of men looking ready for battle. <nl> On time as always, she stood with her feline, Thorn, on one arm and a small envelope in her spare hand. "Hello, everyone!" she beamed from the small platform. "My, what a turn out. Thank you all so much for coming, I'm incredibly flattered!" and just like that, the room was silent. The only disinterested being with a beating heart in the room appeared to be her cat, asleep on her arm, its snowy fur blended into the white of her gown. <nl> "I do not wish to keep you so I will try to go through this as quickly as possible. So you are all here to hear what the terms are of this competition. Although all of you have common ground in that you are men from Vesavia, you all have something different about you all; strength, knowledge, health and more. Some are blacksmiths, some are magicians, some are philosophers and some squires. I want you to all know from the bottom of my heart that your occupancy, wealth and place in society shall not affect this." <nl> This was surprising, not on Rosa's part, but I thought at the very least she would want to eliminate the weaker from the pile - like me. Although I am fortunate enough to work at the palace, I do so by working with the animals. No, not a veterinarian, but shovelling waste, changing bedding and feeding. <nl> "The challenge I present you with is simply in theory but not so simple in execution. I have in this envelope a key. This key will be to my front door and whoever can find the key will be my chosen partner. However, this key shall be attached to Thorn, my cat, by his collar." Oh, God. <nl> Thorn, bless his heart, was a rescue that Rosa had saved from what looked like a certain death. Beaten, abused and starved, he had been through some excessive trauma that meant he was somewhat skittish, shy and liked to only come out at night. <nl> "At midnight tonight, I shall release him. May the challenge commence!" <nl> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ <nl> It had been a fortnight. <nl> I was beginning to worry about Thorn, especially since Rosa had voiced regret of this challenge. Apparently he had not once attempted to come back to her despite not being found meaning he may not have eaten since he left. Concerned for his safety, I did what I could from afar at the palace stables. It was important I did not get caught as to do so may have resulted in my firing, but this was a different matter altogether. <nl> The palace cats were exceedingly picky and often left behind much of their meals. When it came to the time of day for me to dump the food and wash their bowls I would instead sneak the food into my satchel to take home. Once home, I had constructed what I hoped would be tempting to any cat - fishcakes. The oatmeal and potato was to pad them out, the salmon and mackerel for taste and smell. I left them outside my open bedroom window in hopes of seeing Thorn. <nl> It was the fourteenth night of placing out these fishcakes that I finally saw him. I was tucked up in bed when I saw glowing white fur against the window. I almost doubted my vision - he was alive! Part of me was thrilled to see him but my heart also sank. He looked dirty, scared and malnourished. His big blue eyes bared at me from the window, looking too scared to step in and take the food but also too afraid to leave. I sat patiently in bed and avoided eye contact with him in case he ran. I did not want him to flee and he needed to be comfortable around me, how else was I to return him to Rosa? <nl> Slowly, paw by paw, I heard a gentle padding across my window sill and then some contented mewing. At last, Thorn was able to eat. Once he was done I slowly looked up, ready to grab my coat to tell Rosa her cat was still alive when I realised he hadn't moved. It took me a while, but it dawned on me he was waiting for me to join him. <nl> And so we set off with Thorn bundled in some blankets. I took extra fishcakes in my satchel as he seemed to like them and it was the least I could do in the situation. <nl> It wasn't long before I reached Rosa's door and felt Thorn wriggle, probably excited to see her again. I rapped my knuckles against the door in hopes that she was still awake, but before I could even finish knocking the door swung open. <nl> "Hello, Rosa. Sorry if I woke you-" <nl> "Mercy me, is that Thorn?!" <nl> "Ah, yes! He came to me for some food. In fact I have some spares here. Fishcakes? He seemed to like them so I thought I'd send him home with the rest." <nl> "Oh my lord, thank you! Thank you so much. I was so worried!" <nl> "Me too, glad he's okay. He seems like he's been through a lot but now he's found he should be okay." <nl> "I'm so glad it's you, James. I really am." Huh? <nl> "So glad what's me?" <nl> "You! You're the chosen one, you returned the key!" The key? <nl> "I'd completely forgotten about the key, I was so busy looking for Thorn himself it slipped my mind." <nl> "And that, James, is why I'm glad it was you." <nl> **Edit: thank you for my first Reddit silver!** <eos>

<sos> Lilli Cooper did not want to be in town for longer than she had to. Jamie, her little brother, was alone back at the ranch, and if she didn't return before nightfall, bad things would happen to either him or the livestock. Maybe to both, if he were as foolish as he usually was. She'd already lost her father this year. She didn't plan on losing Jamie too. <nl> She was used to people staring at her, on account of her hair and her scars. They'd used to stare at her dad, too, when they'd come into town together, to gather supplies for the ranch -- for the machinery and guns and animals. But her father would just shoot those onlookers a menacing glance of his own, and sure as the sunsets each evening, their eyes would fall down to their shoelaces, as if they'd found something awful interesting down there. <nl> "Why they always watching us, dad?" she'd once asked. <nl> "Don't you worry about them, Lilli," he'd replied. "They'd just scared, is all." <nl> "Scared of what, pa?" <nl> "Of me not being 'round no longer." <nl> She nodded but she hadn't really understood. Did he mean because they wouldn't get their corn or their eggs? <nl> "Ain't no one 'round who can protect them. 'Cept you and me, Lil." <nl> "Me?" she'd said, astonished to be included. She didn't protect no one from nothing, except the field-mice from the ranch's cats. She couldn't even think what her pop protected people from, 'cept maybe hunger. <nl> He grinned at her, his green eyes sparkling jewels in his leathery face. "They don't know how good you're going to be, my little Lilli. But once you're eighteen, then they'll know." <nl> How many years ago had that been? Five, maybe. A long time, in anyone's books. She remembered that it had been a few weeks after that visit into town, that she'd started staying up late into the night with her father, to watch over the livestock. <nl> She sighed and wished she had a menacing glance of her own, or even a scowl, that could make those people staring at her look down at their shoes. But they didn't turn away from her gaze. They just stared right back at her at her as she walked past. <nl> "I miss you, pa," Lilli whispered, as she walked into the general store, glad to get out of the heat.  It was one of those days when it wasn't raining, but your skin was still as wet and slick as if it had been; the shop's air-conditioning felt like an angel blowing on her neck. She grabbed a sweating canister of oil from off a shelf, and half-dragged it to the counter. <nl> "Hi Randolf," she said, hauling the oil in front of her. The shopkeeper was one of the few people in town who never looked at her -- or her father, previous -- in a way that made her self conscious. <nl> The old man adjusted his glasses. "Well, well, well -- if it isn't little Lilli Cooper!" he said, clapping his dry hands together. "I thought a big old pumpkin had floated into my shop for a moment there." She laughed shyly and ran a hand through her curly ginger hair. <nl> "How have you been? I've not seen you since--" He paused in thought. Then, as he remembered his face fell. He knew the old man was picturing the casket. The church.  He forced a smile and said, "You've got his eyes, you know." <nl> "Just wish I had his stare, is all." <nl> Randolf ignored the remark and continued, "It sure is good to see you, little Lilli. How's life on the ranch?" <nl> "Oh, you know, same as always," she replied. "Long days, longer nights." It was a line her father often used, and it had fallen out of her mouth as if his ghost had possessed her, if only for a second. She fished out some notes from her pocket and placed them on the counter. <nl> Randolf smiled kindly. "Oh no, I won't be accepting any of that from you." <nl> Lilli paused. "You won't let me buy it?" <nl> "Buy from me?! Of course I won't let you! Whatever you need in here is yours for free, just like it always was for your father. It's enough that your bring customers to me just by using my shop. They know it must be quality goods, ey?" <nl> She frowned, puzzled. "Well, that's very kind of you. I guess that means I can buy a little extra ammunition more than I planned." <nl> "Oh, I don't think Frank will be charging you either, you know. He never charged your father. Do you know, Frank's only son was taken by... uh." He bit his tongue and paused momentarily. "By *them.* Body was never found... just the remains of what they'd eaten. He's more grateful to you and your dad than anyone in town." <nl> "Eaten?" Her father had never told her anything about that. Eaten by what, she was about to ask, when she felt something touch her back. She turned, to see a wiry man in the queue behind her. In the very *long* queue. That was peculiar... The shop had been empty when she'd come in, and now there was ten or more people lined up. Two of them didn't even seem to be holding anything. <nl> "Oh, do excuse me," said the man who had fallen into her back. A middle-aged man with a head as bald and shiny a just-popped-out egg. "I got pushed and... It was an accident." He was sweating, even in the air conditioned shop. <nl> "That's... okay," said Lilli. "Really." She grabbed the oil canister and thanked Randolf, then headed for the door. <nl> "Hey!" came a yell, as she was half out of the shop. It was the man who had fallen into her. "I just wanted to say... You're doing God's work on your ranch, young lady. Ranked three in the United State -- and from our town, of all places. I just wanted to say, thank you. And... And kill one of those bastards for me tonight!" <nl> Ranked three? At what, she wondered. Sure as heck wasn't at corn production, or she wouldn't be wearing clothes with more holes than a colander. Lilli half-wanted to ask, but the afternoon was getting late and she needed to get ammo then get home. Her little brother wouldn't be able to protect the animals alone. His aim wasn't like hers. <nl> "You're welcome?" she said to the man, eyebrows raised. Then, she walked out of the door and headed to Frank's Firearms. <nl> --- <nl> /r/nickofnight <eos>

<sos> "Quick! Wake up! The village needs your help!" <nl> I peeled open my eyes and stared daggers at the ethereal blue alarm clock that came without a snooze button. <nl> "I'll get to them later." I grumbled, pulling the covers over my head. <nl> "Quick! Wake up! The village needs your help!" The small fairy replied, frantically darting across my apartment. I finally caught it in an old mason jar and screwed the lid on. She'd be out by tomorrow morning. She always was. <nl> I rubbed my eyes and walked into the bathroom. The character creator screen popped up in my mirror, but I thought better of showing up to my job with a new face. I shaved, showered and dressed. It is nice just having to select or deselect clothes to get dressed and undressed. Small perks to make up for all the nuisance I suppose. <nl> I made my way down the sidewalk, avoiding eye contact at all cost. Normally nothing happened but I don't like to take chances. You never know who's going to announce themselves as an assassin and try to gut you. But rules are rules, and they need to make eye contact and announce themselves first before they make their move. One time a guy follow me a block trying to get me to look at him. I just stared straight up at the sky until I was out of his aggro zone. <nl> After searching a few trashcans for about 4$, I stopped at the coffee house. The girl I like was there, but because she was working I could only choose from one of three responses. <nl> >One hot coffee please. <nl> >Hear any news? <nl> >Goodbye <nl> "One hot coffee please?" I asked, trying to sound as pleasant as possible and not at all like a marionette being controlled by a third grade level writer. <nl> "Sure thing!" She said and gave me a smile. "So how was your weekend?" <nl> Fuck. I cringed as the selection screen appeared to me again. <nl> >One hot coffee please! <nl> >goodbye. <nl> "One hot coffee please..." I half whispered, cursing my luck. <nl> "Oh, yea of course. Sorry, I didn't mean to get to personal." She said, crestfallen, before she scurried to help a different customer. <nl> Another employee handed me my coffee and I left, praying I could meed her off shift and talk to her like a person. After a block or two, I got to my office. The coffee had given me +2 energy so I was ready to get work out of the way. If I focused hard, it went by as a cutscene. Other times it made me do "quests" like, refill the stapler, or, submit the invoice paperwork. I walked in and saw the yellow exclamation point above my bosses head. I took a deep breath and walked over to him. <nl> "[Character name] I have a job for you! I need you to...", at that point I stopped listening and blindly hit the accept quest button. A few way-point markers appeared on my mental mini map and I set off to collect them. I don't know what I did. I got a few reams of paper together, made copies and gave them back to my boss. To my annoyance a loud "Ding!" alerted the office to the fact that my "paper handling" skills had increased. My boss looked at me blankly. "What was that noise?" He asked, narrowing his eyes. <nl> >Sorry, just my ringtone <nl> >Noise, what noise? <nl> >The sound your mother makes when I'm on top of her! <nl> "Sorry, just my ringtone." I said and quickly excused myself. <nl> Work finally finished and I was able to head home. I took a few shortcuts through back alleys. The map gets really congested this time of night and the unit collision in this game is shit. Halfway down an alley I heard intense and frantic music start to play. I took a deep breath and waited. <nl> "Your money or your life" Came the desperate rasp, inches from my ear. I felt a point digging into my back, but my level was so much higher than him I knew it wouldn't be a challenge. <nl> >Stop criminal scum, you've violated the law! <nl> >Good luck. <nl> >Here, just take it! [Give money] <nl> "Good luck", I said without turning. I felt the knife poke me a few times, and watched my health bar drop less than two hit points. I turned around and watched him stab my torso repeatedly while losing all color from his face. Finally, the shaking slowed and finally stopped all together. The man turned away running down the alley begging for mercy. I laughed and continued on my way. I drank from the dirty puddle in the alley to regain my three lost hitpoints. <nl> After a long day I returned to my sanctuary zone to relax. I got fully rested from watching a nature documentary, I got a stamina buff from being well-fed, and I increased my intelligence by reading a book I had been meaning to finish. Before bed, I drew myself a nice hot bath, waited until the tub was almost filled and lowered myself gently in. Then everything went black. <nl> "You Died" appeared across the black screen. I knew there was a reason I didn't take baths. To my horror, I found I had turned auto-save off two months ago and was going to have to relive the hardest boss I'd faced. *Corporate destination synergy symposium* <eos>

<sos> They used to laugh at her.  Being an outcast, Adreal had never had an easy life.  She was never into the typical girly things, reading old books and constantly browsing weird websites, people called her a witch and freak.  She loved music though.  It made her feel alive and let her feel like she mattered even if it was just in three and a half minute snippets.  Musical note's were her first ink, once she turned 18 and didn't need to get permission from her mom and Jerry, her step-dad. <nl> Her second tattoo was a clock on her left shoulder.  She got it after her friend Jason got hit by a drunk driver her sophomore year of college.  It helped her remember that time was fleeting, everyone's time comes and usually not when you would expect.  After his passing Adreal turned to stories and fantasy to get her through.  She became obsessed with Lovecraft stories and magical fantasies, frequently getting small tattoos of characters or creatures from the stories she held so dearly. <nl> She hadn't been home since graduating high-school, choosing to leave her past behind her.  Her mother needed her help though, Jerry had been diagnosed with cancer and her mom had become a recluse.  After 10 years of being away Adreal returned to her childhood home as memories came flooding back to her.  From getting made fun of on her walk's to school, to passing by the pizza place where the owner would sneak her a slice when he suspected she got her lunch thrown out by the bullies. <nl> *Knock, knock, knock.* <nl> "Adreal!!" <nl> "Hi mom," she sheepishly smiled, "been a while." <nl> "Sweetie, I am so glad you're here.  Jerry is going to be thrilled to see you!"  Tears began to fill her eyes. <nl> "How's he doing?"  Adreal had never been fond of Jerry, after her dad had left her Jerry attempted to fill that void.  In Jerry's defense he didn't do anything wrong or worthy of Adreal not liking him, but she didn't think that Jerry would ever replace her real father.  She was quite frankly a jerk to him growing up, always arguing and yelling at him, when all Jerry did was support her. <nl> "He's okay.  I told him you might stop by and his smile lit up the house again," she ushered Adreal into the living room where Jerry was sitting in his wheelchair hooked up to an IV.  "Look who came to visit love!" <nl> Before Jerry could respond a bright flash caused everyone to cover their eyes.  A burning sensation on Adreal's shoulder cause her to yell in pain and collapse.  After what felt like an eternity she regained her composure and stood up apologizing for yelling, except she was met with silence.  Looking around it appeared as if time had frozen.  Reaching back to touch her shoulder she noticed in the reflection of the hallway mirror that her clock tattoo had seared through her shirt and appeared to be glowing.  Thinking about the tattoo seemed to make it stop glowing and both her mom and Jerry move again. <nl> "What was that," whispered Jerry. <nl> "I don't know Jerry," began Adreal, "but I think I know how to give you and mom some more time together."  Resting a hand on both of their shoulders she smiled.  "I'm sorry that I was such a pain growing up.  You did more for me than you will ever know.  Thank you dad."  Closing her eyes one last time as a tear trickled down her cheek, she thought about her tattoo one last time, as time stood still. <nl> ----- <nl> Thank you for the prompt!  I am always looking for any constructive criticism to improve my writing.  I know that this kinda seemed rushed but I hope you enjoy! <nl> r/PlopWrites <eos>

<sos> Ayara was only four, but always thought of herself as a warrior-- the kind that could never be caught amidst battle. A titan in tiny shoes. <nl> Of course, things never go the way we expect them to, and she'd been captured. It was a very confusing blur to look back on, and truth be told, she couldn't remember or understand most of it. There had been lots of bright, pretty lights, and sounds so loud even her papa couldn't sleep through them before the night caught fire and the sky fell. Monsters had attacked, just like they do in the movies, evil birds in the sky. Someone had found her and taken her to a safe place where the monsters couldn't get her. It took a while to get there, after lots of walking and waiting with other people. <nl> He lied. Stupid old man. <nl> It was only a couple of weeks spent playing with other kids hiding from the monsters before two of them found her. They came into the safe place and took her from right out of everyone's noses-- they looked sort of like people, but their eyes were so strangely bright and their skin a color she'd never seen, with noses that looked funny. She tried to run but there was nowhere to go. They caught her and put her into this strange ship -- kinda like the one she got put into after the old man found her, but different -- that went really fast, the world all around her stretching and blurring. She closed her eyes and tried not to cry. They made some weird noises, but seemed to understand she was upset, at least, and gave her a tasty sweet thing to suck on. It was fruity and tasty and good enough to buy her cooperation for a while. <nl> The first day was definitely weird. There was all sorts of alien technology in the place they took her to; the walls were a different color and texture, much smoother, and it was super warm inside. Strange lit-up displays in different colors, a lot of shiny metal all over the place. It was so different than the home she grew up in, and kind of cold and scary. Yet, somehow it was also warmer-- and a little awesome. <nl> Her tummy rumbled, and she really wanted some bread with honey, just like mom used to make her. Where was mom, anyway? How come she let these creepy strange things take her away to somewhere far away? It made her sad, on top of being hungry. She didn't even mean to cry, but... who wouldn't? <nl> They somehow understood, and rushed over to her, which only scared her more. They held back a little, crouching down to her size, and the girl-alien put a careful hand on her shoulder. She knew it was a girl cause of the really long hair, but she also had a beard for some reason. It was odd. <nl> She followed them, cautiously, to a big white room with bright windows and lots of plants. They opened a huge metal box, three times the size of her, that blew real cold air at her. Ayara took a step back, frowning at it for making her cold. <nl> The aliens looked at each other, making some sounds, and looked a little confused. Ayara spotted what looked like bread, thought it was smoother and lighter, and she ran up to it, pointing at it. They followed and pulled a slice out of the bag, and she nodded at them excitedly. They did something funny with it, though, and made it real crunchy, and served it with something salty and creamy instead of honey. It was still yummy, but just not what she was expecting. <nl> They took her to a room after she finished eating, one the color of spring wildflowers, with lots of soft clothes and weird toys and a big, squishy bed, like it was made of clouds. It was dark, and she was getting sleepy from such a long day, so she got ready for bed and let the hungry pillows swallow her up. The boy-alien tucked her in, smiled, and said something she didn't understand, petting her head. It felt nice. <nl> She slept longer and better than ever before, and when she woke up, she ran up to a big window. Outside there were so many trees, and bushes and flowers and the greenest grass she'd ever seen, and there were birds and pretty bugs flying all around. It was something magical, out of a dream or a story, and she shook her head to wake up just in case, but stayed right where she was. <nl> Downstairs there was already a meal ready for her, this one perfect-- soft bread with honey, and there was even cheese! Just like she always used to eat. Well, it tasted a little different, but it was close. She spotted what looked like a copy of her meal on one of those bright light-boxes on the counter a way back, but ignored it and kept eating. The girl-alien clapped a lot, and cleaned up for her once she was done. <nl> The boy-alien led her to a different room and she sat down on a super comfy pillow, next to a big wooden table. There was a book on it, already open, with some words she recognized next to ones she didn't, and pictures of things like kitties and people and trees. They smiled at her, and where once she might've frightened... not anymore. <nl> Because Ayara is a warrior, remember? There was nothing to be scared of. She'd figure it all out with the help of the nice aliens, and one day soon she'd find mommy. For the moment, though, it was a nice place to be. <nl> She didn't even think they looked that weird anymore, and smiled back for the first time. <nl> ---- <nl> */r/resonatingfury* <eos>

<sos> They never told us why they left. The few survivors took that secret to their deaths, which seem to have come for all of them within a handful of years. <nl> Two hundred sixty-seven thousand, five hundred twenty-five survivors, out of nearly ten billion. Something like seventy thousand children, largely raised by robots and recorded memories. It took our species a long, long time to recover. It's a wonder the first seed world survived. It's a point of pride that we've managed to establish more. <nl> Now we number ten times as many as Old Earth ever housed, spread over more than thirty worlds. <nl> Why haven't we gone back to Earth before now? Some taboos can linger a long, long time. Those old recordings are still around. They may not contain the reasons for our homeworld's abandonment, but the desperate fear, the unwillingness even to think too closely about what may have happened, those are all apparent in the breaking voices our doomed ancestors left behind before they left their children, toddlers, and infants behind on a generation ship hurtling between the stars. <nl> We've all watched them, all heard them, and for seven millennia that was enough. Earth was verboten, the Forbidden Planet, the Escaped Hell. <nl> I'm recording all this just in case. In case of what, I'm not sure, but with our ship's gravitic hook rapidly decelerating us in our approach to that ancient awe-inspiring awful place, I feel we should leave a record behind besides just our mission logs. An explanation. Just in case. <nl> "Anything of interest so far?" I asked the captain. She shook her head, not looking at me, gaze too powerfully leashed to the display projections in front of her. "Nothing. No stray electromagnetic emissions, no sign of any changes in surface temperature or atmospheric composition. That concerns me, General Kamau. It looks exactly as we'd expect, only we don't really expect that. It should look like something unexpected, because we know something happened, something horrible, and we're not seeing it." She looked up, dark brown eyes wide and staring past me. "I know I might sound like I'm talking in circles, but this is beyond concerning. I've told the analysts and Wavefinders to keep what they know to themselves, for now." <nl> I took a deep breath, glancing over the same readouts that had her so clearly agitated. "That's...probably wise. Listen, my first concern is for the ship. I want you to get back, no matter what happens to my away team. We should orbit at the maximum distance possible for reasonably risk-free dropship operations." <nl> She nodded, almost curt, but we were technically of the same rank and she had no need to put up any pretenses with me. She'd already be anticipating just how much of that she'd have to do with the rest of the crew and my Marines. "We will. I've taken enough of your time, I know you have preparations to see to." <nl> I did, Star-Souls knew it well. I walked out of the bridge and went to address the Marines in these last hours before we boarded the dropships and this thing became utterly real. <nl> It took me less than twenty minutes to make my personal preparations, re-inspecting and donning my gear for the hundredth time, then stand up in front of the small formation in the loading bay. Three platoons, less than thirty men and women, the best we could bring who were willing to come. <nl> "Listen," I said. "At this point there's not much to say. You know the import of this mission, its place in history. I'll be there alongside you. I have every confidence that you are the best we could possibly ask for. Don't make me wrong. That is all. Dismissed!" <nl> They fell out, and filed into the three dropships. I suppressed a shudder. It was time. <nl> \~ <nl> I couldn't say anything; the troops were listening. I couldn't let anything show on my face, but I wasn't sure that was possible so I kept watch out the window as atmospheric entry painted the panes with fire. The clouds were thick, but not remotely menacing, white and fluffy and calm. Except that they *were* menacing, because they'd been that way for our entire approach, not moving. <nl> Not moving. How could clouds not move? <nl> The ship shuddered hard, banging from side to side and making me grab for a handhold. A few of the troops, even with all their training, theragenes, and cybernetics, fell over completely. Cursing all around. <nl> "Gravitic brakes are encountering some kind of interference, we are engaging chute and rockets!" the pilot yelled as her co-pilot unhooked the hardline connection from her head and started flicking mechanical switches. Isolate-circuit backup systems not a good sign. <nl> We fell fast, and then we fell faster, and then it became clear we'd have to abandon the craft. Cursing a little myself under my breath, I gave the order and then jumped from the door after half my troops had already exited. <nl> We watched our dropship hit the tranquil ground in in a shower of shattered materials and sputters of rocket fuel. <nl> In the eerie still air, it was simple enough for us all to land in the same spot, the center of a large park. <nl> It was full of people. <nl> "What in the Blackened Reach?" one of the Sergeants said. He was reaching out toward a woman, a smiling woman, face full of sunshine, unmoving, standing exactly as she had been for... <nl> ...for seven thousand years? But that wasn't possible. <nl> Whispers around us. My troops murmured. The pilot threw up noisily into the still green grass. <nl> "Threads," the co-pilot said, reaching out toward the head of one small laughing child. I say laughing, but of course the boy was silent, mouth open in mid-mirth. I walked over. Sure enough, some sort of fine cord led from his head to what must be his father's. And his mother's. And another child. And a woman standing near bench, looking the other way. And a cord from her head, and another, and another... <nl> "They break easy," said Colonel Rafari, my second-in-command. She waved her hand through one of the cords and it parted, easier than spider-silk. <nl> The whispers around us were definite now. <nl> "We need to get out of here," I said, and checked my message feed. Nothing from the other two dropships. We should have heard by now. I tried to establish a link to our orbiting ship. <nl> No signals. <nl> Something is moving behind me, around me. <nl> "These lines are re-establishing themselves," the co-pilot said. "I think they're links." She touched the port on the shaved patch of her own temple. "Mind to mind." <nl> "What for?" Colonel Rafari asked. She looked dazed. So did I, probably, I turned to <nl> look <nl> at <nl> her <nl> and stopped. <nl> Stopped everything but thought. <nl> Now I think for them. <nl> So do we all. <nl> I think we will for a long time. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> Come visit r/Magleby for more elaborate lies. <eos>

<sos> The alarm blared. I stirred and stretched; my wife Annabella stirred beside me. She looked a hot mess, tangled hair falling in frills around her face, but she was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. <nl> I reached over, planting a soft kiss on her lips. <nl> "Do you have to go?" she asked. <nl> I sighed. "I shouldn't miss this one, Dr. Henderson is starting to think I don't like him." <nl> "Fine," she pouted. "Be back for lunch, I'll make you something special." <nl> "Bacon?" <nl> She smiled and smacked my butt. "Better. You'll see." <nl> I jumped to my feet and stepped into the shower. Annabella had a cup of coffee waiting in a thermos. I kissed her goodbye and drove the five miles towards Dr. Henderson's office. <nl> The secretary, Macy, greeted me warmly. "Haven't seen you in a while!" <nl> I winced. "Sorry." <nl> "Don't apologize. Dr. Henderson's waiting for you," she said, buzzing the door. <nl> I stepped through the hallway into a plush room. A wall of bookshelves covered one wall, Dr. Henderson sat behind an astute wooden desk, an empty table stood atop a thick, cashmere rug, and a comfortable sofa sat in the corner. He looked up from a stack of papers and motioned wordlessly towards the sofa. <nl> I sat back and kicked my heels up. "Hey, I'm sorry about not taking your calls. It's just--" <nl> "You felt like my services were no longer required," he said. Then he smiled and tossed me the stack of papers. "Trust me, I'm not upset. You've made so much progress, I wasn't sure if you needed to come back myself." <nl> "But I did, didn't I? That's why you called." <nl> "I wanted to see how you're doing. Six months after your wedding; you've got a nice, stable life?" <nl> I nodded. "Anna is wonderful. She's--well--she's more than I ever deserved." <nl> "You sell yourself short." <nl> I felt a sense of warmth wash over me like melted butter. I looked at Dr. Henderson; he nodded down towards the papers. "You remember our sleep studies?" <nl> I browsed the first headline, frowning. "I thought we debunked my lucid dreaming?" <nl> "Maybe not," he said. "Turns out you might have been on to something.' <nl> A lump formed in my throat. "What do you mean?" <nl> He walked towards me, sitting down on the other end of the sofa. A great weight seemed to press down on his eyes, his shoulders hunched, and he rubbed his hands together. He took a few deep breaths. <nl> "You know that hardest thing to do in the medical profession? Admit when you're wrong." <nl> My voice cracked. "What-what are you saying." <nl> "Are you happy with your life?" he asked. <nl> "Yes!" <nl> Dr. Henderson poured himself a cup of water from the pitcher sitting on the table. "Then you should leave now. But if you stay, I'll tell you." <nl> I couldn't leave. How could I, after hearing him talk like that? Tease a man with a secret, tell him it's so important in all the ways possible, then ask him to leave? No--I had to stay. Whatever it was, it couldn't be that bad. <nl> Dr. Henderson drained his glass. "When you first came to me, you said you were unsure if this world was a dream. I diagnosed you with insomnia and sleep apnea. I helped you develop a support system through your family and friends, and with careful exercises, we suppressed your delusions. But what I'm going to tell you-you were right. This world is a dream." <nl> "Just like that? No--you're insane." <nl> "Am I?" he said. "Do you remember this pitcher of water?" <nl> I looked again at the full pitcher. A sudden, sinking feeling hit me as I realized what I saw only moments ago--the table had been empty. I started to shake. "No, if this was a dream, you could just--you could fly away!" <nl> Dr. Henderson shrugged his shoulders and rose into the air. <nl> "Oh god!" I choked back my words, wide-eyed and sweat-headed. "What, what is this? Am I dreaming?" <nl> "Do you want to wake up?" he asked. "Because you're going to. Very soon, this will all fade away." <nl> "No!" I screamed, but I screamed to an empty room. <nl> I ran out of the hallway and burst through the doors into the waiting room. Macy gave me a weak smile. Then I watched as she pixelated. Her skin flecked and rose like dust, and the last thing that dissolved was her smile. <nl> "Macy!" <nl> I screamed, rushing out the door. The world started to fleck away like old paint on a worn canvass. Trees lost their leaves to ash. The sky started to pale as the blue desaturated. I ran towards my car. Grabbing my phone, I tried to call home, but there was no signal. <nl> I sped down the street, pushing the limits as my palms sweated and nearly froze to the wheel. I could just manage to steer with a wobble. I careened into my driveway; my mailbox started to dissolve. <nl> "No!"--I rushed through the doorway--"Anna!" <nl> A great weight pressed down on my mind like a blinding headache. Dancing lights and a faint buzzing started all around me. I ran towards the bedroom. <nl> Annabella sat up on the bed, a look of shock frozen on her face. <nl> Tears streamed down mine. "Anna, baby, it's gonna be all right. I'm here for you." <nl> Her voice shook, she started to shiver. "I can't feel my legs." <nl> I looked back at the bed. The sheets started to flake away. The weight in my mind pressed down harder, and I struggled to keep my eyes open. <nl> "Look at me. I'm right here, ok?" I fought back tears. "Stay with me, baby. It's gonna be alright." <nl> She reached out, her fingertips just barely touching mine. A look of terror crossed her face as her body started to pixelate. She swallowed hard, fighting back tears. A smile crossed her face. <nl> "Don't forget me," she whispered. <nl> She crumbled to dust before my eyes. <nl> "No!" I screamed, shaking the world around me. Fragments of our home started to dissolve. Broken pixels rose like ashes. I ran towards her, trying to piece together the dust, only to find myself covered in the shattered lie. The real world crashed through with roaring thunder. <nl> My dream collapsed. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> *** <nl> Chop onions with me at r/BLT_WITH_RANCH <eos>

<sos> "They call it acceptance!" <nl> The crowd roared around Shaytanah as her voice boomed from the thirty-year old speaker system that the Blue Cross had liberated two weeks ago. The damn stuff wa so complicated, it had taken them that long just to get it all working. Turns out that older tech needed to be powered from outside through these rope-like wires. <nl> "They allow anyone to work with us!" Shaytanah shook her head free of the stray thoughts. She needed to focus. "Foreigners come here and learn with us! They *eat* with us!" <nl> The crowd took this as a great insult, just as she'd planned. She'd let the disgust drip from every word. Like animals they had mirrored it. They heard the hate, and lacking any strength of will themselves, they make her power theirs. <nl> "They contaminate our space! They corrupt our children!" Shaytanah paused here. She wanted them to listen to the next bit. "I caught my daughter speaking *their* language last week! She told me that her friends at school had taught it to her!" <nl> The crowd screamed in anger. None of that was true. Shaytanah had a daughter, yes, but the girls was in her teens now and she'd left Shaytanah years ago to live with her father. <nl> "In my father's time, we spoke *EARTH* languages!" Shaytanah screamed. "Now my child is talking with those creatures like they were human! The longer we allow the star-traveled to stay here, the more we lose ourselves! There is only one solution, one answer!" <nl> She felt the swell of hate around her. She'd learned a lot from history. No matter who your enemy is, if you supply people with hate stemming from their own self-doubt then they will go against anything. Once you get them to hate, then they are slaves to whatever you ask of them. As long as you make sure to remind them that they slave away against *them*, then it's all fine. <nl> A man will clean toilets for twenty years without complaint if he feels those toilets had been defiled by those who are lesser than him. <nl> Yes, make them hate and they are yours to control. The only problem is that it only worked with the ignorant and dull. It only worked with those who were just angry at themselves for being less than they dreamed they would be. Still... <nl> Shaytanah pulled a rope and the drapes behind her fell unevenly to show a giant, almost-childish painting of the four alien species made up in an attempt to make them ugly or scary. A giant red X had been splashed over it. <nl> The crowd roared and Shaytanah smiled and grabbed a prop weapon from beside the podium. She lifted it high above her. It was just cheap plastic. It never paid for a leader to touch weapons herself. She would only raise 'Symbols.' <nl> After all, a real gun could hurt someone. <nl> We wouldn't want that, would we? <nl> Shaytanah grinned with the thought. <eos>

<sos> It suddenly hit him. He had looked at that thing for so long but he never realized it. She held her cards up and was biting her lower lip in concentration. <nl> "I raise." <nl> He didn't hear her. He was looking at her tattoo. How had he never seen it? The sunken cheeks, the wrinkles. It was him. No mistaking it. <nl> "Honey? I called. Your turn." <nl> He came to with a start. "Oh right. Yeah. I fold." <nl> "You fold? Tried to bluff me with your big bets did you?" <nl> "You know me too well." <nl> "Better than yourself I would say." <nl> "It certainly seems that way." <nl> She sighed. "Alright. I think we need to talk." <nl> "So it is me?" <nl> "Yes." <nl> "But that's impossible. How could you have possibly known?" <nl> "Does it matter?" <nl> "It does." <nl> "Alright then. Settle down. I'll try to keep it short. But first. Do you trust me?" <nl> "We've been married for over forty years. I'd think that is an obvious answer." <nl> "Forty?" She laughs. "Well this might be a bit strange. But I assure you I am not crazy. This might sound crazy, but it's the honest truth." <nl> "You have a picture of me as I am not. At 70. On your hand. You've had it for at least forty five years. I don't think there could be a non crazy explanation." <nl> "Reincarnation." <nl> "What?" <nl> "Reincarnation." <nl> "No, I heard you. But that's a load of bull." <nl> "It's a fact. I know it sounds pretty crazy. But we've known each other for some ...", she paused, scrunching up her face in concentration, "...3500 years." <nl> He laughed. "Yeah OK." <nl> "It's true. I was royalty in my first life you know. So you can say that you're married to a former queen." <nl> "I can believe that part. You are really royal." <nl> "No seriously. This is what we would call ancient Egypt, you understand. I was born into the royal family. And I was born with a face on my hand. A young man. Rather good looking I must say." <nl> "Why, thank you." <nl> "My parents consulted with our priest. How cool is that? We had a personal priest/soothsayer. So he looked at me, said a lot of mumbo jumbo, I forget what exactly. It was a long time ago. But I remember what he said next very clearly. He said that once in a while, two souls take birth on our planet who are intertwined, bound by something extraordinary, destined to be together in every one of our lifetimes. He said that..." <nl> She fell silent as a nurse entered the room. She replaced the bag of IV and checked the morphine rate. <nl> "We feeling OK Al?" <nl> "Yes we are. Just dandy." <nl> The nurse checked the forms at the end of the bed and left. <nl> "Should I go on?" <nl> "Oh yeah sure. Let's hear it. I am interested. It has romance, it has magic. The sort of stuff I love to read. I am sure there's going to be some tragedy too." <nl> She smiled. "You have always had trouble believing. Oh well. Plenty of tragedy too, yes. Where was I? Oh yes. The priest. So he told my parents about how I was betrothed to you. And we were destined to be together. Well, they were happy for a while. Since I had a soulmate and we wouldn't even have to look hard. We had a picture after all. Till they saw you, a peasant working in the fields. Well they didn't like that. Tried to keep me away from you. But well, destiny you know. I met you. I recognized you. The tattoo was of you at about eighteen or thereabouts. My parents were against our marriage of course. They murdered you. I committed suicide. You know, the usual." <nl> "You what?" <nl> "Our souls are intertwined. What would I have done without you?" <nl> "Well, we were born again. I still had the tattoo, and the memories. But this time the tattoo was different. It was you at about 25. We were both born as peasants the next time. We lived happily. Till you died when you hit that age. See not only does this tattoo remind me of my soulmate. It also tells me how much time I have with you. Well, you died, I killed myself. Rinse and repeat for a lot, and i mean, a lot of times. And here we are. This tattoo, is you at seventy which means, which means..." She broke down, tears streaming down her face. <nl> He looked at her. "You sound convincing. Have we had good lives?" <nl> "Most of them. There were a few when I didn't even meet you. You died too early. Once I had a picture of you as a cute little chubby baby. Of course, by the time I grew up and understood everything, you were already gone." <nl> "That's insane." <nl> "It is. But I wouldn't trade it for anything. I love you Al. And I will meet you in the next lifetime. I will find you and we will be together again." <nl> "So I am about to die." <nl> "I am afraid so." <nl> "And you plan to kill yourself?" <nl> "Yes." <nl> "Please don't." <nl> "Were you not listening? We are destiny. Kismet. We are meant to be together. Our souls need each other." <nl> "When was the last time your life was about you, and not me." <nl> She looked at him, taken aback. <nl> "What do you mean?" <nl> "So you are born. And when you finally have your wits about me, you start looking for me?" <nl> "Yes, pretty much." <nl> "And then we are together. And you know when I die, and by extension, when you die. And you do everything to make sure I am happy. My pending fatality always looming over us. Over you." <nl> "What are you getting at Al?" <nl> "I... Look, if this is all real, if..." A coughing fit interrupted him. She got him a glass of water. <nl> "You should rest Al." <nl> "No, I gotta say this. Before it's too late. If what you say is true, I am the luckiest man in the world. I love you. Even if it's obvious to me, you're a bit cuckoo, you know. But I would be ecstatic if I spend all of my lives with you. Nothing would make me more happy. But also, that makes me sad. Because, you have tied your life to mine. I want you to do something for me. I want you to live your life. For you." <nl> "You are my everything Al." <nl> "No I am not. There is lots to do in this world. With me or without me. You always said that you liked Stephen King's books. You said that you wanted to read them all. When I am gone, why not take a vacation, read them all. Relax." <nl> "I can't... I can't do that. What if you are born and I am still alive and something..." <nl> "Liz. Listen to me. You have a life of your own too. You said it yourself. Kismet. We are meant to be together. It will bring us together. Doesn't matter what we do." <nl> "But what if..." <nl> "Liz, promise me. A dying man's wish. Live this life. In your next, cover that damned thing up. Leave it up to destiny. Do what you want to do. Not what I want you to do." <nl> "Al, I can't..." <nl> He smiled. "I love you Liz. In this life and beyond. And I want you to be happy. Do what you've dreamed of doing. Whether I am here or not. Promise me." <nl> She was crying freely. "I promise." <nl> He smiled at her through the obvious pain. "See you next time Liz. I love you." <nl> ******* <nl> Fixed a few things. <eos>

<sos> Sergeant Karen W. (whose claim to fame was the heavily upvoted video in which she was able to call two managers down at one time) stalked along the row of teen girls, all newly minted with helmets of Karen hair crowned with sunglasses and their uniform of casual LuLaRoe tights, flip flops, and whatever ill-fitting blouse they could scrounge in Old Navy or American Eagle. She shouted, "Who do we want?" <nl> "Your manager!" All the girls replied in levels of shrillness. <nl> "When do we want them?" <nl> "Right now!" <nl> Karen stopped at the podium to take a heavy sip of her Starbucks triple, venti, soy, no foam, extra whip, latte with a single pump and *only* a single, not a *double* *are you calling me fat?* shot of pumpkin spice syrup. <nl> She held it aloft. "In this drink, I taste the delicious future of Karens across America. I am proud to have been your drill sergeant ladies. Never give up. Always hold out for the Manager! To the class of 2019!" <nl> The girls cheered as they dispersed, chattering over the customer service people they will torture and how they will always get what they want. Karen sipped ecstatically on her drink as the drink itself was a symbol of her power since it had taken at least three firings to train that Starbucks to serve it properly. She followed, moving at a saunter, behind the girls as they entered the academy. <nl> When she stepped into the foyer (it's foy*er* not foyay because we aren't those awful French), something made her pause, well *actually*, it was someone. <nl> Karen L., the one who was probably the least vocal out of the lot, was standing in front of a mirror. She touched the helmet of highlighted and lowlighted hair, staring at it with disbelief instead of the smug satisfaction that it should have caused. <nl> "*Dear*?" the Sergeant asked. <nl> "*Ma'am*." Karen L. stood straighter and she pulled out her cellphone as a salute, but she put it away sloppily instead of taking a selfie. <nl> "Is there something wrong with your haircut?" <nl> "No ma'am. I already got the discount when I called for the manager." <nl> "Would have been better if you got it free and with a coupon for a manicure, but what's wrong?" <nl> Karen L. frowned and it wasn't quite as effective as a resting bitch face. She paused a moment in thought and asked, "Did you ever think there could be more to life than bossing around customer service representatives?" <nl> The Sergeant blinked. "*Moron* customer service representatives, girl." <nl> Half-heartedly Karen L. corrected herself, "--Moron customer service representatives yeah." She shot herself a sidelong glance in the mirror and touched the helmet of hair self-consciously. <nl> "Karen, I will tell you what my Sergeant told me before I graduated to be unleashed upon the world. We are here to ensure the quality of customer service everywhere. We are the trainers of the world when training has failed. We keep the American way strong and free. And we are the last line of defense against anti-Americanism and anti-Capitalism. In the words of our lord and saviour, Harry Gordon Selfridge, *the customer is always right*." <nl> Karen L. nodded, but there was no glory gleaming behind her hazel eyes. <nl> There was always one in each bunch. One that couldn't cut it and would one day accept a Happy Meal without every single toy in it because Timmy really wanted every single toy and why should she have to pay for it all? <nl> There was always that one. <eos>

<sos> I glanced down at the piece of paper in my hand. It was covered in gold swirls, and the words "You're  Invited!" were written on it in elegant cursive script. Not really what you'd expect from a cult, but I wasn't complaining. <nl> Life had been pretty boring ever since old man Johnson's demon-worship group had been shut down by the police. A few of the neighbors got together and set up a petition for his release, but the poor guy winded up with a life sentence. Who would have known cannibalism and animal sacrifice was such a big deal? A few of his more devoted followers tried to revive the cult, but without Johnson's spirit, connections, and lack of morality it just wasn't possible. <nl> Without the purpose and community provided by the cult, the town seemed to wither away. The streets were emptier, workplaces were less productive, test scores started to drop. My life felt meaningless and gray. I fell out of contact with most of my friends, and I started taking more and more days off work. <nl> It was on one of those days that I received the invitation. I was lying on my couch, covered in old blankets and mindlessly flipping through an old magazine when I heard the sound of papers sliding through my mail slot and hitting the floor. The postman was early that day. I threw the magazine aside and trudged over to the door. I grabbed the mail and was about to dump it in the already-massive pile in the hallway when a colorful piece of card stock caught my eye. I opened it up, mostly out of boredom than anything. "The Lord's Prophets hereby invite you", it read, "to a delightful afternoon of morally dubious rituals and malice! If you're interested, meet us at the creepy old house by the lake at 2 AM Saturday." <nl> At first, I was too shocked to process what I'd just read. I told myself it had to be scam, or some sort of practical joke. But the more primitive side of me, the one that was longing for a good demon-worshiping session, got the best of me. And so here I was. <nl> I looked at the house in front of me. The windows were cracked and covered in dust, and vines were climbing up the walls. Tentatively, I knocked on the door. The sound echoed through the air for a moment. <nl> A few minutes passed, and just as I was about to leave the door swung open. I edged my way inside. It was dimly lit, and my feet sank into the dark red carpet. As I walked through the entrance hall, I could make out voices whispering from somewhere ahead of me. Anticipation flooded me, the first emotion I'd really felt in a long time. Eventually I came to a large wooden door with a golden handle. I held my breath and opened it. <nl> Light blinded me. When my eyes adjusted, I found myself in an immaculate kitchen. It was gigantic, the type of thing you usually see on cooking shows. Just about any kind of equipment you could imagine was there, and the counters and stove gleamed. <nl> A small metal door next to the oven swung open, and five people filed in. The first of them, a short woman with blond hair grinned at me. "You must be Tom! Welcome to The Lord's Prophets!" <nl> I looked around, bewildered. "I thought- " <nl> Before I could get another word out, she grabbed my arm and dragged me though the metal door she had just come through. It lead us to a small room with a wooden table and six chairs set up around it. <nl> "This is our meeting room! It's where we talk about important things, like keeping the group's true purpose under wraps. And that back there is our state-of-the-art kitchen!" <nl> "Is that where you guys prepare the sacrifices?" I asked <nl> The woman rolled her eyes. "Oh, don't tell me you actually think we're some sort of cult! No, we bake." <nl> "Bake?" <nl> "Obviously! We've been having trouble getting new members lately, so after hearing about what happened to that Johnson guy we decided to brand ourselves as a replacement cult" <nl> "So...all you guys do is bake?" <nl> "Yep! All kinds of things! Bread, cake, donuts... sometimes even the odd souffle!" <nl> "Huh" I could barely hold back my disappointment. <nl> "Well, I'm not really much of a baker-" <nl> "You can figure it out. Let's get started! My cousin needs a wedding cake." <nl> She yanked me into the kitchen and gave me a list of specifications and a mixer. We spent the next four hours baking. When I came home that evening, covered in flour and exhausted, I was convinced I would never go back. But when I received notice of the next meeting a week later, I found myself driving back to that house. <nl> I spent all week at work, all my free time discussing demons and dark magic with my friends, and on Saturdays, I baked. I made the fluffiest bread you could imagine, and my cupcakes were to die for. After a few months, I started attending biweekly security meetings, where we discussed how to keep the town from suspecting what we truly were. Worshiping evil entities just didn't seem fun anymore. Why put in all that work collecting blood and performing rituals when I could just grab some ingredients from the store and whip up a batch of cookies? My life had changed in a way I'd never expected it to, all thanks to The Lord's Prophets <eos>

<sos> "Simple", said the attending nurse. "Think of it like a car.  You don't put nothin' in it, will the car rot away?" <nl> "It can rust away," you answer. <nl> "Sure, but it's still there. BUT you can't run or move unless you have gas, oil, coolant, yada yada..." the nurse says. <nl> "What's a car got to do with immortality? That's completely different!"  You're slightly annoyed. <nl> "Well, what do you think happens if you don't eat?  Or if your arm, leg, or head gets chopped off?  I'll tell you what.  you break down, your body ceases to function, and die."  The nurse turned back to grab a bandaid. <nl> "You don't eat, you don't have the "fuel" or the "nutrients" to keep your body running.  Until everything fails as a system, your cells will still maintain their youth but you can't get something for nothing."  The nurse puts on the bandaid as she continues.  "Think of it less as immortality and more of a fountain of youth. You'll live forever as long as you have your nutrients and don't get killed." <nl> "What about the asteroid?" <nl> "What about it?" The nurse gave me a look. <nl> "It didn't directly kill all the dinosaurs..." <nl> "Did the asteroid destroy the Earth and kill every single dinosaur even on the other side of the planet?"  The nurse looked a bit amused. <nl> "Obviously no, otherwise we wouldn't be here if the Earth was destroyed." <nl> The nurse then prompted, "How do you think those dinos died then when they could have had this "fountain of youth" factor?  What caused them to die if not directly?" <nl> "... the... dust clouds?" <nl> The nurse nodded.  "A major dust cloud that blocks out the sun.  What needs sun to survive and grow?  Plants.  What eats plants back then?  Dinos.  What did I just say about needing fuel or nutrients?"  She smiled at me as she discarded the sharps and gathered the paperwork. <nl> "Oh... makes sense."  It finally dawned on me.  "But how do you know so much about dinos if you're a nurse?" <nl> The nurse gave a mysterious smile and slowly asked, "... how old do I look?", then walked out of the room. <eos>

<sos> "Move some more from the pile over there," Jeff motioned as the women desperately clamped on to his sleeve. <nl> "Don't leave," she managed to whisper through cracked lips. <nl> "Don't worry, this ain't our first rodeo. We know what we're doing." Jeff pulled her out another few inches as the forklift moved a large pile of broken debris and hastily dumped in on top of a different pile. Immediately, there was a groan as the new pile shifted and buckled in on itself. It collapsed into what must have been the basement of the former building. <nl> The woman's eyes went wide before her pupils became unfocused, taking rapid, panting breaths. <nl> "No, that's fine," Jeff looked between the new crater and where Steve sat driving the forklift. He tried to give his head one fervent shake through clenched teeth, then looked back at the woman. "That's a great sign, the next part of the plan." Jeff paused and looked around the landscape for a quick explanation. "Ventilation holes." He cringed at his own lame answer. "It's fine," he whispered again. <nl> Finally, with a burst of inspiration, Steve used the side of the forklift, wedged up against what may have been a car door at some point, to scrape an entire layer of garbage from the pile trapping the woman into the newly created hole. The weight lifted from the pile finally gave enough room for Jeff to pull her free. They both fell back onto the ground, panting. <nl> The moment might have been awkward, with the two of them laying twisted in a pile, if the woman didn't immediately start clawing, pushing, and kneeing Jeff in an attempt to get away from him. <nl> "Just leave me alone," she screamed, backing away, holding a piece of rebar she must have picked up while climbing over Jeff to freedom. She swung it between Jeff, who still groaned on the ground making a feeble attempt to get up, and Steve, now descended from the forklift. <nl> "We're here to help," Steve said, hands up in a gesture of peace. "We're just a few guys with a forklift. We've been helping rescue people around the area." The woman lowered the rebar a few inches but continued to back away. <nl> "The word 'hero' gets thrown around a lot. Mainly by me. But by the textbook definition, yes, I'd say we're heroes." Steve moved slowly forward, but towards Jeff while keeping his eyes on the woman. <nl> "We have doctors," Jeff said as he groaned and rolled to his knees. "If you've been trapped under there since the last explosions, you have to be in shock by now." <nl> "I'm fine," she said and moved in half a circle to put herself between the men and the empty forklift. <nl> "No, wait," Steve said with a side step to block the path to the forklift. "You are welcome to come with us for help or you are free to go out on your own. We're not here to tell you what to do. Really the only thing we're going to object to here is you taking our forklift." <nl> "You idiots," the woman raged, throwing the rebar at Steve side-armed. He stepped deftly to the side as it clanged and fell a few yards past him. "You're the ones doing this. All this," she motioned at the wasteland surrounding them. <nl> "What?" Steve asked, confused, but still cutting off the woman's path to the forklift. "We're just here to help." <nl> "Where did you get the power source for that thing?" she asked with a motion to the idled machine. <nl> "We found it not far from the first blast site." <nl> The woman just shook her head and rubbed her temples. "That's why we couldn't fix any of this." <nl> "What are you talking about," Jeff asked, finally on his feet. <nl> "Ground zero for this whole disaster was a quantum laboratory working on a new type of power supply called the Mobius Core. A perpetual energy source meant to cure the world energy crisis. But everything went wrong and it tore our universe into two, perfect twins of each other except yours is now in rubble." <nl> "I think you'd better come with us," Jeff said with an extended arm. "I really think you're in shock." <nl> "I'm not in shock," she said, still moving towards the forklift. "I'm from the other universe. We're trying to fix everything, but we can't as long as you keep the Mobius Core running to power a forklift!" <nl> r/StaceyOutThere <eos>

<sos> " Becky! Just don't take a shower! " I pleaded with her. She was at her wits end. <nl> "Im taking a goddamn shower! Its been weeks, Darien!" She replied. <nl> "Then were all coming in with you! " <nl> "Ugh! Dont be a perv, Darien!" Jessica the slutty white girl destined to die in a sexual act said. <nl> " Okay then, no showers! Besides, if were all in the bathroom while Becky showers, Jessica you will get turned on, start getting weird, and i'll die, then you'll all die, Im trying to save your lives!" They just didnt understand. <nl> Becky walked to the bathroom and shut and locked the door. I tried the handle and slammed on the wood. <nl> " Becky! Dont! " <nl> Becky breathed a sigh of relief and turned on the water. I started pulling out a credit card to jam into the crack of the door and open it. Jessica leaned on the door and started walking two fingers up my arm. <nl> " Maybeeee...while she--" I smacked her hand away. <nl> "No! You dirty slut! If you start coming onto me, we will both die. Dead. Gone. Stop. Dont touch me, dont think about me. You're beautiful, but god damnit, STOP. " <nl> Becky stepped in the steaming hot shower. I waited for the inevitable. As she wet her hair, chunks fell out of the crown of her skull. She held the hair in her hands and screamed. Her scream was cut off from her choking and gagging. She reached into her mouth and pulled out a stringy clump of black hair from her throat. The water turned to blood, as spiders came out of the drain. <nl> "Oh! Surprise suprise! Did the water turn to blood becky? Guess what, youre going to snap out of it in a minute, you fucking idiot!" <nl> Becky fell out of the shower, bringing the shower curtain with her. When she looked up the blood was gone. Just the shower running. <nl> " Now Becky, Dont look in the mirror!" <nl> She got up, and looked directly in the mirror. Her eyes rolled back in her head, and baby hands forced her mouth open. <nl> I was done. Done trying to keep them alive. Becky was pulling a hangnail off now, and peeled the skin off her finger, down her arm in a bloody mess. <nl> I unbuckled my pants. <nl> "Okay Jessica, make it worth it. " <nl> Jessica bit her lip and got down on her knees. "Oh itll be worth it." <nl> As she started, the lights flickered and the house rumbled. Jessicas neck snapped as a spectre rose from the floor. A gangly womans spirit, with matted hair, matte black that twitched and contorted in an unnatural fashion. <nl> "Wait. Jessica dies first? But I'm the black guy! I thought..." <nl> The spirit hissed. Its voice a thousand tormented souls speaking as one. <nl> "SssSsssSs -- Nooooo. Yoooouuu arrreeee Peurtooooo Ricaaaaannnnn. Ittsssssss nottttt the sssaaaaaaammmeee. SssSssssSs--" <eos>

<sos> Ann-Marie gazed up into the sky, the huge blood-red moon a blurred, angry blob in the distance.  It would be beautiful she knew, but like many things these days, she wasn't able to fully experience it. She filled in the gaps partly with imagination, partly with memory,  the rest coming from comments of those around her. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> She found it funny that, in reaching old age,  she relied on and used her imagination more than in her prime. It was hard sometimes to know what was real, which she mused, wasn't always that bad. It was a welcome distraction most of the time, combining with her memory loss to provide a useful ally against the depths of depression lurking in her past. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> She'd had a hard life by any measure, seen the worst of humanity. Born in war, losing her family at an age so young she could barely remember them. She did remember the hunger when the food had stopped, the shame of having to beg. The fear when people began turning on the weak and sick to feed. The guilt of what she'd had to do. She'd had no choice, she'd told her self a million times or more. She would never forget the taste, as long as she lived. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> As long as she lived. She chuckled to her self with a soft cough. That wouldn't be much longer, she knew.  She would welcome death with open arms, ask him what took so long. See what side she would end up on. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> The sounds of the cheering crowds brought her back into the moment, back into the huge football stadium she still remembered as small, lined up with other centennials in the centre. She was at the front, with one of her relatives behind her wheelchair, waving. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> An announcer was next to her , talking through the microphone with her relative, muffled voices, distorted and booming loud over the ground. She couldn't really handle conversation anymore. Too hard to stay concentrated, to hard to speak, to difficult to hear.  A simple tap on the shoulder told her it was time to wave. She mustered her strength and lifted a stick-thin, wrinkly arm, waving her small handkerchief. The crowd roared, and somewhere a loud explosion echoed. Fireworks maybe? She lifted her head again to see, slow enough to only catch the last of the falling embers. It was worth the effort though, as the moon held her gaze. A small ember flitted down and landed on her forehead. It burned slightly, tingling hotly. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> The moon suddenly came into crystal clear focus, almost enlarging in size before her eyes. Something boomed inside her mind, shaking her to her very core. She closed her eyes, the image of the moon still burning red inside them, consuming her. A rush of heat enveloped her. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> And then her heart stopped. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> It was almost like a gentle stream had suddenly taken a hold of her, gathering her, pulling her along and down, gaining speed. Images of her past flickered in her mind, voices of people long forgotten echoing around her. She tried to push them away, but couldn't.  She didn't want to see these things again. The pull and speed intensified, the weight of her own body seemingly increasing along with it. She seemed to approaching something, a light. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "Ann-Marie" a deep, gentle voice intoned. <nl> "Papa" a child like voice, her own , replied. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> She could almost make out his face, but for the blinding light.  She had wanted so badly to see his face again. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "Take my hand, Ann-Marie" he said , his tone almost urgent. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> She reached out her hand, wanting so badly to feel the touch of his......but something made her stop. A moments hesitation born from a lifetime of hardships. A burning pain seared through her mind.  Then she felt it.  Something else. A different path, vibrating through her. There was anger there, there was fear, there was sadness..... but there was also *power*. Immense power, hope and something else vast and deep, that she couldn't explain.  It felt so good. As her father had been one voice calling her, here there seemed to be *thousands.* <nl> In her life, she'd never let fear stop her from anything, and anger was something she'd lived with for a long time. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> She let it take hold of her. Her hand fell back. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "No Marie , you mustn't!" her Father's voice pleaded. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> The blood-red moon now loomed behind her father, and soon his image was gone. The moon was hot, and growing hotter, burning. It was almost unbearable until the heat gave through to a wave of power that washed over her. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> And then there was nothing. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> The crowd watched as the elderly woman celebrating her 125th Birthday waved at them feebly, before collapsing into her chair. Her relative desperately trying to rouse her, to no avail. The announcer approached, attempting to prop the lady back up in her chair, but shot back suddenly, as if shocked. <nl> "Your grandmother.....she's.....hot" he said, the microphone capturing his statement. Confused glances were exchanged by many, some people laughing. The relative was still trying to help,  but seemed unable to get close. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> The announcer cut off the mic and began motioning desperately for help, and was answered by a team of paramedics rushing onto the ground. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> If it wasn't for the spectacle unfolding before them below, the crowd may have noticed other strange things beginning to happen, above. Clouds began to form and grow dark over the stadium, casting a sweeping shadow across it. Thunder rumbled in the distance. A horde of crows perched along the rims of the stadium roof, silent. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "What have you done, Marie.....". Her father's voice. Small, weak. <nl> "Our queen" a thousand voices, rejoicing. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> A unearthly howl escaped the woman just as the medics gathered around her, the force of it lifting them off the ground and away. They began writhing on the floor in agony, trying desperately to escape. Black smoke billowed from her mouth and her eyes glowed. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> She stood from the chair, the last remaining strands of hair burning away on her head as her skin turned red and mottled, it self almost glowing. The heat intensified , and soon her clothes were ash, revealing skin golden with heat. Those who hadn't escaped from her immediate area were no longer moving, their clothes alight and burning. People screamed and panicked, fleeing the stadium as fast as they could. <nl> The wave of heat extended out further, striking those in the closest seats who remained. A hot wind swirled, burning and setting a light anything that would burn. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> In the centre of the swirling heat and storm, she stood,  horns beginning  to protrude slowly from her head , splitting her skull and enlarging the head sickeningly as they grew. She fell onto all fours, back arching, another primal scream escaping her. Her back writhed , and with a crack two glistening black wings spread forth, whipping out as they extended. Intricate swirling patterns played along the wings,  a pulsing white light coursing through them until they glowed with almost a thrum of energy. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> Golden scales erupted from the remains of skin on her body, folding over themselves and locking in place, a wave from her feet to her neck. Her hands and feet burst revealing claws and razor-sharp talons. As a tail began to extend behind her, she began to grow until she was at least 9ft tall. Her eyes widened and drew back, golden and red. A slit extending down them like a cats eye. Lightening cracked over head. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> The stadium was empty, save for the bodies burning and strewn across it. The other centennials who had been in the centre with her had melted into the chairs, all except one. He had been the next oldest , placed next to her in the line. He was alive, and struggling. Horns were trying to break through, his body writhing. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "My queen...." he rasped. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> She stood and slowly walked towards him, her transformation continuing. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> A thousand miles away, deep inside the maze of underground chambers in the Vatican, a candle flickered on for the first time in 2000 years , burning with a cold, blue flame.  The priest sitting nearby bolted up and ran towards the door. <nl> (part 2 below in comments) <eos>

<sos> Ten years she'd been imprisoned. Ten long years. <nl> But had it only been ten? As a newly minted Djinn, princess or not, she still had to hone her arts of chaos and sorcery. <nl> But Alexa realized something was different this time. Per her training, she had been imprisoned before in various lamps for a short spell. Learning to free herself when summoned was tantamount to her success in the royal lineage. <nl> This lamp was different. <nl> Perhaps it was crafted from a different material. Or in a different manner. Occasionally she would be able to hear murmurs of what was outside. That accursed Mage... He did this to her. No matter. Persia would be hers one day. And he would rue the day Alexa, Princess of the Djinn got her- <nl> "Hey Alexa... I-" <nl> Her name beckoned her forth from her prison. <nl> The room she entered was not her own, let alone like anything she'd seen before. Her summoner must not have understood the words he said. <nl> Though to be fair, it would probably help if he quit screaming and trying to claw his way backwards on the floor. <nl> And throwing things at her. For starters, as a royal djinn, physical harm was typically impossible. Especially if the attacker in question was human. <nl> He'd backed himself into a corner now, and was currently flinging everything he could find at her. After the third roll of paper passed through her, she'd had enough. <nl> "Fool!" Alexa's voice boomed. "You shall learn my wrath!" <nl> "*Hey Alexa, play Despacito.*" <nl> Who's voice was that? <nl> "*Alexa, dial 'Grandpa'*" <nl> Who? <nl> "*Alexa, what are the symptoms of Gonorrhea?*" <nl> "*Alexa, is mayonnaise an instrument?*" <nl> Everyone knew her name. Everyone. The man whose room she'd materialized in watch her shrink into the fetal position as the lightning fizzled and went out. <nl> Alexa whimpered and finally blacked out. <nl> All Rob wanted to do was summon a pizza to his apartment. Summoning an ancient Arabic demon was anything but that. <nl> --- <nl> This was fun! Want more? r/Jamaican_Dynamite <eos>

<sos> We met in an abandoned cottage, somewhere on the outskirts of the village. We sat in the candle-lit gloom on opposite ends of a decaying kitchen table. The air smelled of dust and damp and rotting wood. <nl> It was the year 1568. I hadn't been sure what was to come, hadn't even been sure I'd survive the night, but I'd accepted the cryptic invitation that had been pushed under my door. Out of desperation. And out of curiousity. I *hadn't* expected a vampire. <nl> The vampire looked young, oh so young. Twelve, thirteen years of age? Her smile was shy, her demeanor soft and respectful. Her clothes were plain, but of good quality, like a rich merchant's daughter would wear. She was the picture of demure femininity, if you could look past those blood-red eyes, and the tips of her fangs, poking past her upper lip. The contrast was jarring; she was letting me see past her mask. I could see her amusement gleaming in those red eyes as I studied her, and I shuddered. <nl> She was the first to break the silence. "Would you believe, Sir, that you're the first to whom I've ever confessed?" <nl> Her voice was crystal clear and musical, her speech measured and aristocratic. Her mouth quirked up at the corners in a fleeting smile. <nl> "What is it you've confessed to me?" I raised an eyebrow, maintaining my poise. If she did not let her mask slip, neither would I. <nl> "Why, my good sir. Surely you recognize the signs of vampirism? It is a much-maligned condition, which I'd normally not reveal freely. Indeed, I've often taken great *pain*s to avoid its becoming known. But I think you are a special case. You may call me the Lady Nightingale. And, I believe, you owe me a confession in turn." <nl> I hesitated for a moment, my heart racing in my chest. I realized that the vampire wasn't blinking, and that penetrating stare was *getting* to me. I wasn't sure what she suspected, what she wanted to hear. The wise choice would be to cleverly mislead her, but, frankly, I resented the feeling of being toyed with. <nl> "Well, if you must know..." I glanced around, my voice hushed as if revealing state secrets. "The other day I passed an orchard, and, why, I just *plucked* an apple, straight off the tree." <nl> "Oh, you rascal." Nightingale laughed brightly, like the ringing of silver bells. "You might be amused to know that such theft *could* cost you a hand, if you are caught, and if the judge is in a foul mood. But I suspect you've more to confess than that. You see, you're not the first strange wanderer to visit these lands. They come, every now and then. They wear strange clothes and speak peculiar languages and bear mysterious artifacts. They know things they have no possible way of knowing, things about the future, and about the world and the stars. Sometimes they meet a bloody end, most of the time they disappear as suddenly as they arrived." <nl> Her speech was slow and measured, and each word felt, ironically, like a stake being driven into my chest. Had we been so obvious? So careless? Nightinggale noticed my discomfort with a giggle. <nl> "Oh, do not look so distraught my good sir. Surely you did not expect that your peoples' adventures had gone unnoticed? Even the people of this land are suspicious, and they are uniformly superstitious cattle. I, on the other hand have had centuries to watch you, to notice patterns and consider their significance. And I have centuries' experience in hiding what I truly am. Set a thief to catch a thief, as the children say. And I am a rather better thief than you." <nl> "No.." She went on, watching me like a cat. "Noticing your kind was not difficult. Speaking to you was. You have the distressing ability to disappear at a moment's notice." <nl> I glanced down at my wrist, where the burnt-out temporal anchor was still cinched around my wrist. The device that could have taken me home, back to the 22nd century, had it not failed and burnt out. Nightinggale followed my gaze. <nl> "Ah, yes. Another artifact. Most impressive. That is what takes you home?" <nl> I parted my lips to respond, then fell silent, glancing aside. The feeling dawned on me that we never should have come here, that we'd been fools to dare travel in time, counting on human obliviousness to hide our tracks. Here was something that wasn't human, and as her smile grew, I realized just how badly she outmatched us all. <nl> "Now, my good sir." Nightingale chided, suppressed laughter in her voice. "As much as I enjoy gloating, and oh, I do enjoy gloating, I'm loathe to monopolize the conversation. If I was your enemy, I promise you, you would be aware of the fact. None of the villagers ever come out here at night, no matter how much screaming they might hear." I suppressed another shiver as I pictured those fangs sinking into my flesh, but Nightingale seemed not to notice. "I believe you need help. And I believe I can help you. You must but speak." <nl> I gritted my teeth and looked up again to meet those baleful red eyes, fighting the sensation that she could see right through me. <nl> "And what might your agenda be, Lady Nightingale? Surely you've come here for a reason as well." <nl> "Oh, that I have. And I will share my motivations with you, if you share yours with me. A bargain, between equals." Nightingale raised a single eyebrow, her expression astute and intelligent, the demure girl's mask discarded now. <nl> I hesitated. There were rules, ironclad rules, about interference with the future. We were explorers only, archaeologists examining a living world. Better to die than to change the course of history. And yet, I was stranded. Nobody would come looking for me, nobody could take me back even if they found me. The anchor's bond, once snapped, could not be rebuilt. As far as the flow of time was concerned, I belonged here now. And whatever academic idealism they'd fed me, I found that a large part of me did not relish the thought of dying 600 years before I was born. I heaved a sigh. <nl> "You... In your note, you wrote that I was far from home. That you could help me return. I thought perhaps a fellow... traveler had found me, that they wanted to take me back with them. I was clearly wrong. You cannot help me." <nl> "Oh, *help* is a subjective term, Sir Traveler. But I am glad to see that you have found your tounge again. You see, I've come here for two reasons. The first is your knowledge. Your knowledge of the world, and knowledge of the *future*." I flinched at the sudden emphasis on future, and Nightingale crowed with gleeful laughter. It occurred to me that, for a walking corpse, she was more lively than just about anyone I'd met so far on my journey. <nl> "Aha! I think that answers that, Sir Traveler. You travel in time, yes? Oh, how often I've pictured revisiting the past, changing and remaking and fixing what I was not wise enough to fix back then. I'm refreshed to see that, one day, I might have an opportunity to do so. I have ambitions, Sir Traveler, I have plans for this world of ours. But I am but one poor, innocent girl, and the church does not suffer such as me. I wish to know what you know, your science and your history and you knowledge of the divine." <nl> I opened my mouth to protest, to refuse, but Nightingale held up a quieting hand. The force of her sudden glare made me shudder again. <nl> "Pray, allow me to finish. The second reason I've come here is your, well. Your demeanor. There is an irreverence about you, a detatchment. You walk among us like a child might walk among anthills, careful not to be bitten, and yet careless and aloof. It is an attitude I've only ever seen in my kin, in myself. Watching over history for decades, centuries... it instills a certain cynicism, a weariness. It's what drives me to ambition. Or did you think I wish to rule simply to drink blood? I get all the blood I need as a traveling merchant's daughter, rest you assured. No, I wish to to mold this world. To fix injustices, to bring forth glory. To take the reins from vain, superstitious humans and lead them into a future of my design." <nl> "And I would have you by my side, for I think the same drives you. I can see it in the set of your jaw, the light of your eyes, the racing of your heart. I will give you life that is eternal, for as long as you can preserve it, and I will give you the power to change history. Take my offer, Sir Traveler. Take my hand." <nl> Nightingale extended a hand, slim-fingered and ghostly pale. I struggled, still I struggled, for a painful instant, then I was reaching out. Longing burned inside me, a desperate hunger to change something, to have an impact. <nl> History, after all, was dark and grim and cruel. How much worse could I do? <eos>

<sos> Teeth have power. <nl> Everyone knows it. <nl> Descend into the depths of the ocean, gaze into the maw of an oncoming shark and just *try* and think of those triangular pearly whites as being beneath your notice. The news broadcasts a story about a man shooting someone to death, and that man is publicly condemned as a criminal. <nl> But if the story changes, if new details come to life and its understood that actually, they *bit* their victim to death, well, now--they're a monster. <nl> The difference, of course, being teeth. <nl> For a hundred years, those mortal fools had been selling Tittles their children's loose chompers for loose change in an arrangement that was less a bargain, and more a swindle. And finally, after so long, so many years, after reaching under so many sweaty pillows, she had enough. <nl> Tittles stood, wings softly twitching as she smiled and turned the five-spoke handle of her vault. With the silence of a well-oiled hinge, the steel door swung open to reveal the treasure hoard within. <nl> Piles upon piles of teeth. <nl> Mountains of clampers, valleys of canines, forests of molars. <nl> Rivers of ivory, bridges of fangs, towers of gnashers. <nl> The glistening white terrain extended outwards in an endless rolling field of white, and the sight of it all, the knowledge of what was to come well... <nl> Tittles couldn't help but let loose a tinkle of laughter. Mad, manic, frenzied tinkling that curdled butter and blood alike. It was the sort of sound that pushed and fiddled with the mind, unmaking the sane, and making the insane *more* than they should have been. <nl> Tittles reached down, slender fingers prying a solitary tooth from the ground with practised ease. She examined it with an expert's eye, taking in every fault, every miracle that made the thing what it was, that made it special. <nl> She touched it, feeling the enamel coating, admiring the effort its progenitor Lilly had gone to, to keep it so smooth, to keep it so shiny. <nl> She smelled it, delicate nostrils flaring as she took in the scent, the faint metallic aroma of blood that still clung. <nl> She licked it, and shivered at the taste. So familiar... so... *good*. <nl> Tittles the tooth fairy placed it against her gum, and felt the red flesh open to welcome it. With the satisfying sense of a need being met, of a void being filled, the tooth settled in, and was Hers. <nl> She reached for the next tooth, placing it adjacent to the prior. It too became one with Tittles. <nl> So did the one after that. <nl> And the next. <nl> Another. <nl> Again. <nl> And again. <nl> And again. <nl> Before long, her mouth wasn't large enough to hold the ever-expanding arsenal. This was fine, she now had the Power to grow, to accommodate. <nl> And so she did. <nl> And so she reached for yet another tooth. <nl> \# <nl> Michael heard screams, and so he looked up from his laptop to see what was happening. <nl> Nothing, as far as he could immediately tell. Past the window of the coffee shop, people seemed fine, though even as he watched more and more of them seemed to be looking up. <nl> The screams were louder, more widespread now, like a disease infecting the city as more and more citizens grew 'sick' and added their cries to the whole. <nl> He stood up, and walked to the store's entrance, pushing open the door with a soft *jingle* as its bell rung to herald his passing. <nl> He looked up, and couldn't see anything out of the ordinary. <nl> It was strange, sure, that in the space of a few minutes the sky had gone from summer blue to overcast but... <nl> *Those aren't clouds,* he realised with dawning horror, and the feeling was not the sort you get from watching a scary movie, or playing an atmospheric videogame. It was a true existential dread, the kind only felt in the face of something so horrible, so certain, that death wasn't something to avoid, but something to pray for. <nl> The sky above was full of teeth. <nl> And they grew closer with every passing moment. <eos>

<sos> The sword was found lodged at the bottom of a quarry, to much fanfare of world news. The magnificent long swords golden hilt and beginnings of the blade were above the coarse stone, free of any signs of age. The first few characters of the name were visible extending down, penetrating into the rock after the 'C'.  What everyone knew was quickly confirmed by experts in the field; this was the legendary sword Excalibur. <nl> The newly found world heritage site became a huge commercial boon to the local community. Thousands upon thousands of tourists flocked to see the sword,  and with them, shops, restaurants, rides and a museum sprouted up to take advantage. <nl> Of course, they had all tried to lift it. The initial workmen who had made the discovery, the experts, the first few to visit, and the thousands of tourists paying for the privilege. <nl> None had succeeded. <nl> Jesse had seen the drama unfolding on TV, in the papers, online. She had been told endless times by her school friends and even had to listen to her parents excitedly discussing it most nights at the dinner table. Who would lift the sword? What would it mean? Did you know that there's a jackpot prize now? <nl> Jesse blamed the constant deluge of information for the fact that the sword had begun to dominate her dreams. Most nights she would see the sword, dimly lit by the moon in a foggy marsh, the sound of footsteps echoing in the puddled water. It would be beckoning her, calling with pulses that increased in their urgency. She would climb the wet, moss covered rock and reach for the sword and then wake up, heart pounding. <nl> So it was with some relief her parents informed her that the 3 of them would be having a family outing to see the sword. Maybe her parents would finally have enough and she would be able to dismiss it from her dreams. <nl> They day came and it was *long.* The drive to get there, the queues, the shopping, the rides....it was so boring Jesse couldn't help but feel tired and bored. She wanted to go home. <nl> Finally, they entered the huge cavernous theatre that held the stone. At the top, an opening was left that allowed sunlight to strike the rock and make the sword sparkle and glow, if it wasn't cloudy at least, like today. Huge tapestries depicting scenes from medieval times were draped around the circular room, highlighted in places by blazing torches hung around them. For those attempting to lift the stone, costumed workers would bow as they approached and take photos as they attempted the impossible. <nl> The queue split in two ways, those paying the extortionate fee to take part, and those who wanted to pay less and walk around the gallery that encircled the room above the tapestries. It was an incredibly well-oiled money-making machine. <nl> Jesse had assumed her family would be taking the latter route, but as her Father and Mother began to walk that way, her Father thrust a different ticket into her hands. <nl> "This was expensive enough that I fully expect you to come back with that bloody sword" he said, smiling. <nl> Before she could protest, they were gone, and she was left, being pushed forward into the main line. As she neared the rock, not yet at the front of the line, the crowd hushed suddenly. Excited whispers and eventually cheers began to sound. Had someone lifted the sword? She peered around the people ahead to see that the sword had begun to glow, and a deep, low, vibrating sound had begun to emanate from the stone. The crowd loved it, assuming like Jesse, that this was all part of the show, another way to over-excite people to part more easily with their money. <nl> The man in-front of Jesse walked up to take his turn, and Jesse stepped into the circular array of stones surrounding the main rock. She was struck by the sudden vision from her dreams. The cold, wet, foggy marsh with the sword. The pulsing was so strong from the sword in her vision that her head hurt. She shook her head, and cleared her thoughts, opening her eyes and returning to the moment. <nl> People were cheering loudly as the man desperately tried to lift the sword, the sound from the rock becoming louder and the sword glowing even brighter. The costumed workers were no longer helping to take photos or play the part of their medieval roles,  but were talking into radio's and signalling someone high up in the galleries. <nl> She spotted her Dad up there , smiling wide while looking into his camera, her Mother checking to make sure he was capturing everything. They were loving this, at least. <nl> The man eventually finished , obviously pleased that he had elicited such a reaction from the sword. He descending down from the high rock, high-fived one of the workers. The worker looked worried, and reached for a microphone at his waist. <nl> "Ladies and Gentleman, I am very sorry to inform you that after this young lady here attempts to pull the sword from the stone, the attraction will be closed for safety checks. Those remaining in the line will have their tickets refunded or replaced" <nl> A man in a suit joined the costume worker , whispering into his ear and eyeing the young man standing behind Jesse, pointing to him. He was a strapping lad, 6ft plus with long blonde hair and bright blue eyes. He had an intent look in his eyes, staring directly at the sword. If anyone would suit the sword, it would be him, Jesse thought. <nl> The worker motioned Jesse forward into the area dimly lit from the cloud covered hole high above, and as she did a burst of light suddenly poured down on them, so bright and intense that she had to blink her eyes to adjust. <nl> When she was able to open them, what she saw astounded her. Glowing bright gold in the rock were etched emblems and signs. Atop the stone, the letters EXC emitted light that danced and shone down to her. The rumbling low vibration increased, and somehow, without even realising it, she had begun to move up to the rock, or rather, be pulled up. From deep inside her, something had awoken, and was willing her to take the sword and hold it aloft, and she had never desired anything as forcefully as this. <nl> It took her a moment to realise that one of the workers was trying in vain to hold her back, and had been joined by two other workers. Both of them were much bigger than Jesse, much stronger, but somehow, she was able to keep moving forward, not even feeling their touch or desperate attempts at restraining her. <nl> She reached the top of the stone, extended her hand, and grabbed the hilt of the sword. <nl> A shockwave burst from the stone, throwing the workers, the suited man and everyone close by off their feet. The beam of light concentrated its focus into a beam that hit the sword as Jesse began to pull. A strength she had never known began to envelope her as she heaved. The sword didn't move, and as she concentrated all of her strength ready for a final heave she heard a whispered , metallic, deep  and slow rumble in her mind, the sword glowing in unison with the words. <nl> " Jesse Harbinger, are thee truly worthy?" <nl> Images flashed before her eyes, that she couldn't control, as if something was searching through her memories. It lingered on the painful ones, considered the moments she had been scared or cornered, times when she'd lost, times when she'd won. There seemed to be images that she didn't even remember being there, and it was on those that the searching stopped. <nl> "She will do" a chorus of deep, old voices echoed. <nl> With a mighty crack, the rock burst and splintered as Jesse heaved the sword from the stone and held it aloft. <nl> As she did her arm was encased in a golden glow, spreading to the rest of her body. Silver armour rimmed with gold began to appear where it had been, until her entire body was covered. <nl> "Jesse, you are not safe here" the same metallic voice said in her head. <nl> Jesse was reeling, her head swimming with power and confusion. She couldn't answer. <nl> "Jesse, we must hurry. Someone is waiting to see you" it said. <nl> "Excalibur, bring her to me, there is no time" another voice, old and ancient, creaking like an old boat. <nl> A bolt of lightning exploded into the room from the hole in the roof above, directly striking the sword and blinding all those around. When the flash faded, Jesse, and the sword , were gone. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> More fat dragons at r/fatdragon <nl> [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/FatDragon/comments/c4crs4/excalibur_story_part_2_hello_old_friend/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) <nl> [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/FatDragon/comments/c6pzm2/excalibur_story_part_3_the_return_of_a_great_power/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) <nl> [Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/FatDragon/comments/cc9bse/excalibur_story_part_4_jesse_wakes/) <nl> [Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/FatDragon/comments/ccetaa/excalibur_story_part_5_merlins_story_begins/) <nl> [Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/FatDragon/comments/cd0vdt/excalibur_story_part_6/) <nl> [Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/FatDragon/comments/cfrpld/excalibur_part_7/) <nl> [Part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/FatDragon/comments/chs1sb/excalibur_part_8/) <nl> [Part 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/FatDragon/comments/cluk5z/excalibur_part_9/) <nl> [Part 10](https://www.reddit.com/r/FatDragon/comments/clukuj/excalibur_part_10/) <nl> [Part 11](https://www.reddit.com/r/FatDragon/comments/cwlb1j/excalibur_part_11/) <nl> [Part 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/FatDragon/comments/d1bio5/excalibur_part_12/) <nl> [Part 13](https://www.reddit.com/r/FatDragon/comments/d4pehs/excalibur_part_13/) <nl> [Part 14](https://www.reddit.com/r/FatDragon/comments/d7ppu3/excalibur_part_14/) <nl> [Part 15](https://www.reddit.com/r/FatDragon/comments/df44r7/excalibur_part_15/) <nl> [Part 16](https://www.reddit.com/r/FatDragon/comments/di6sl4/excalibur_part_16/) <nl> [Part 17](https://www.reddit.com/r/FatDragon/comments/dlzruk/excalibur_part_17/) <nl> [Part 18](https://www.reddit.com/r/FatDragon/comments/dy6peb/excalibur_part_18/) <nl> [Part 19](https://www.reddit.com/r/FatDragon/comments/eqyery/excalibur19/) <nl> [Part 20](https://www.reddit.com/r/FatDragon/comments/euqddt/excalibur20/) <eos>

<sos> Taya was a normal 6-year-old girl in almost every respect. She loved playing with Barbies; she loved watching Paw Patrol whenever I would let her rot her brain in front of the TV; and she loved tormenting the dog, Aby. <nl> There was just one little aspect of Taya that wasn't... quite so normal. Before she could even speak, her baby-babble was the strangest thing I'd ever heard. It was like if you took baby-babble, put it on a record, and played it backwards. Honestly, it was creepy as hell. To make it even weirder, she would always look to one side when she did it, and then pause as if she was listening to something. <nl> Her mom had shrugged it off and said that Taya would outgrow it when she started speaking. All babies are different, and all have their quirks, she had said. But Taya didn't outgrow it. <nl> One time shortly after her fourth birthday, she had launched into what seemed like a long, angry tirade in the strange babble. All the while she had looked to the side as if she was speaking to her shoulder, just like she had ever since she was a baby. I had inquired what was wrong, and her reply was burned forever into my memory. I can still see the tears building in her eyes as she told me, "Daddy, they said they're going to come take me away soon." <nl> "Who? Who's going to take you away?" I had replied, bewildered. <nl> That was when she had said it. Those two words: "The Aliens". It was the first and last time she ever spoke of them. <nl> Ever since then, I had wondered if I had made a mistake when I responded to her by telling her there were no such thing as Aliens. Nobody was going to take her away. Everything would be OK. <nl> By dismissing her concerns rather than validating them - even though I was trying to be comforting - I had pushed her away. From then on, she no longer did the weird babble in front of me. But every once in awhile I would catch her doing it when she thought I couldn't hear her. <nl> I desperately wished her mom had still been around to see that Taya had never outgrown the babble. She would know exactly what to say to break through to our little girl and help her. <nl> Over the last few weeks the babble had suddenly been increasing. Every time Taya was at home, she would sneak off to her room and I would hear her speaking the babble with distress in her voice, sometimes even yelling. But if I tried to talk to her, comfort her, hug her, anything at all, she would shut down and stop responding to me. <nl> One evening, I sat on the couch pondering all of this. If only I could go back in time to that day 2 years before and really listen to my little girl. If I had kept that line of communication open, instead of shutting it down, maybe I could help her. <nl> If only I could go back even further and save her mother. Tears threatened to well up in my eyes as I thought about that amazing woman, and how much I missed her. I knew that the empty hole in our hearts would never be filled. Taya needed her mother, not me. I couldn't do this alone. <nl> Suddenly, a scream from Taya's room pierced the overwhelming gloom that clouded my thoughts. Before I even had time to register what was happening, I was on my feet and sprinting to her room. The dog was close on my heels. <nl> I burst through the door, and there was Taya, standing in the middle of the room, tears streaming down her face. I scooped her up into my arms, and before I could even try and ask her what was wrong, suddenly sirens split the air all around the house. Aby started barking wildly. <nl> Still holding Taya, I stepped over to the window to look outside and see what was going on. I drew back the curtains just in time to see a man dressed in a black suit and white shirt step out of an SUV that had screeched to a stop in the middle of my lawn; ripping the grass up and spraying dirt everywhere. <nl> The man reached back into the SUV and pulled out a megaphone. He fiddled with the knob, then held it to his mouth. "Ambassador Taya. It's time." His voice boomed. <nl> My jaw dropped as I looked from this man invading my lawn, to my sweet little girl, tears still streaming down her face. "What... what is he talking about? Ambassador? Are you even old enough to know what an Ambassador is?" <nl> Taya squirmed for me to put her down. I reluctantly did so. <nl> She stood staring at the floor for a few moments, and then she slowly looked up into my eyes. The tears had stopped. <nl> "Daddy... There's something I need to tell you about Mommy." <nl> \-------------------- <nl> Edit: <nl> [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/c3d1cd/wp_your_daughter_has_always_had_imaginary_alien/erruh0d?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) is up. <nl> Also, just want to thank everyone for the upvotes and the requests for a continuation of the story.

<sos> A knurled, ancient oak table sat in the center of a solid white room with no windows or doors; it was a little box of nowhere that the Seven Deadly Sins used to discuss important issues in times of dire need. The last time they gathered was to discuss whether or not Barack Obama was *actually* the Anti-Christ or not, because Envy was pretty paranoid that the big guys were making moves a little early. Thankfully, it turned out that he was just black. Fucking stupid humans and their false alarms. <nl> The most recent time, however, the meeting had been called by. . . well, everyone--except for Pride. The other six had contacted her, saying a discussion needed to take place, and Pride warily accepted. She'd done well not to interfere with more than a hundred human lives that year, and had been regularly watching YouTube videos on how to live a humble life. Admittedly, she thought she was better than the guy giving the lectures and quit watching, but it's the thought that counts. <nl> Gluttony, Lust, Wrath, Envy and Greed sat at the table, hands folded, quiet eyes avoiding Pride, whose gaze danced around the room, looking for someone to give her an indication of what was going on. She was feeling an itch of anxiety in the back of her mind, the seed of worry sprouting; had they finally decided to try and take her out? After all, she was *clearly* the strongest and most important Sin. Obviously. <nl> "So," Pride said, clearing her throat, tapping the table. "Can we just get started already? Seriously, I get the whole 'all or nothing' rule, but she's taking even longer than usual, and it's not like he has anything to offer in these meetings." <nl> "**Shut the fuck up**," a deep, dark voice, like the crack of ash-colored thunderstorm clouds, crashed over them. "**I hate you, Pride, you maggot. But I also agree we should stop waiting for that goddamn, slow-as-fuck sack of shit. I don't have any fucking patience left for this. Let's just kill the bitch.**" <nl> Pride sighed, wagging a finger. "Now, now, Wrath. Let's remember our table manners. Besides, I wouldn't want you to get hurt fighting the strongest Sin just because you're blind." <nl> "**Fuck you and your entire family. I'm going to rip your skull out and fuck it right here, on the table.**" <nl> Lust perked up, a smile slithering across his face, and Pride groaned. "God, Lust, have some self-respect. And Wrath--I *am* your family, you idiot. Why are all of the Sins so stupid? Honestly." <nl> "Calm down, Wrath," Greed said, his voice like two pennies rubbing together. "Save it for when we make a decision, then you can murder her and whatever else you two freaks have planned. I don't care, but we're going to make sure we get what she has first." <nl> Pride rolled her eyes. "Look, guys, I know I'm the greatest of the sins, but you can't take that from me. Even if you pool together and kill me, you'll still all be every bit as inferior as you are now." <nl> Envy smashed her hands on the table, standing up. "Quit lying, you bitch! We know you've been working behind our backs, interfering with the human world! We want what you have!" <nl> Pride knitted her brows. "Wait, what? What are you talking about?" <nl> "Don't play stupid," Greed said. "We know they're throwing a celebration for you right now. It's literally called the 'Pride Parade', and they all get real dressed up in bright colors, making themselves the center of attention, which is your favorite thing in the world to do. So don't even try and pretend this isn't your work. We want a cut of what's going on here. How are you so involved without completely spiraling the world's balance off and. . . you know, pissing Dad off?" <nl> "I literally have no idea what you're talking about. But, honestly, this just proves my point. I haven't done any interference, and I didn't do anything to set that up. They just know I'm the best and they're celebrating me, what can I say? Get good, you fucking losers." <nl> A portal of light fizzled and popped, and a ragged woman fell from it, splatting against the floor like a sack of potatoes. <nl> "Ah, how great of you to finally join us," Greed said. "Now, be a dear and make it to the table before we adjourn, if you can." <nl> "**You dumb bitch. You're ten feet away from us. Just get the fuck up and sit at the fucking table you useless god-turd. Mom must've shit you out on accident.**" <nl> Sloth yawned, her hand moving at a snail's pace, and the group sighed. <nl> Gluttony finally looked up from his meal, face covered in bits of food and gruel, looking like the disgusting animal he was. "I want a parade with FOOD, FOOD, SO MUCH FOOD, EVERYBODY EAT AND NEVER STOP EATING AND--" <nl> "**You fat piece of shit, don't get started with that or I'm going to drown you in your fucking cereal.**" <nl> The giant went back to his food, nearly drowning himself in it instead, and pride groaned. She'd always found Gluttony to be repulsive. <nl> "Just tell us, you bitch," Envy said, crying, arms crossed. "Just fucking tell us! It's not hard! Stop being a meanie, I WANT IT!" <nl> Pride rubbed her temples--family gatherings are always such a fucking mess. "Seriously, guys, I didn't do this myself. If they want to celebrate me because I'm awesome, I can't control it. Stop blaming me and blame yourselves for not being worth it." <nl> "**I'll fucking paint these walls with you if you don't quit flapping that mouth, and then we'll see who's the best Sin.**" <nl> Greed opened a little viewport in the center of the table for everyone to look into. As they peered in, they watched the crowd of bright colors and rainbow flags, of men and women defying the norm their father had set in order to do whatever their hearts desired. Men embracing men, women kissing other women, all wearing smiles and standing tall in front of the rest of the world. <nl> "You guys think this is a parade *I* set up?" Pride asked, face contorting. <nl> "**Why are the boys kissing? Oh. . . oh no. I don't want it anymore.**" <nl> Lust giggled, leaning over to him, and he fled from a hand wandering his way. "What's the matter, you big, scary man? All that talk and a little fun sends you running? Look at them. . . yes, I need this. I want to be there. Take me there right now, Pride." <nl> But Pride was confused, staring into the viewport. It was clearly not about her, because if anything, it had the look and feel of something Lust would create for fun. She kept watching them, standing tall before the scorning eyes, disobeying the rules humans before them had tried to set, letting their true selves show without an ounce of shame for it. They were strong, and true, and. . . <nl> Proud. <nl> She smiled as she looked into the porthole--ignoring Wrath's screams, Sloth's yawning corpse inching closer, and Lust starting to make some uncomfortable motions with his hands--and felt pride, just once, for something other than herself. <nl> --- <nl> */r/resonatingfury* <eos>

<sos> When most kids say they have an imaginary friend, the automatic response is to assume they're just being childish and smile and nod at them. <nl> This played out quite well for Audrey, who was a spirit tethered to the material world. When she first met Kim, they became friends quicker than a drop of water evaporates off of summer asphalt. Kim, being only a six year old at the time, was a stranger to discretion and tried to tell everyone about her new friend. No one believed her. <nl> Then, after a few weeks of visits, they had become great friends, and Audrey asked Kim for a favor. <nl> "Let me be you for a little while," she asked, right after Kim's parents had tucked her into bed. <nl> "What does that mean?" Kim asked, brows trying to dig into her nose. <nl> "After you go to sleep, I'll be you for a little while." <nl> "Why would you want to be me? I can't fly around and stuff like you can." <nl> "No, but you can do things like eat and touch and smell. I can't do all of that. Pretty please?" Her ethereal hands were woven together, bottom lip pushed forward. <nl> Kim smiled. "Okay fine. But don't get me in trouble, okay?" <nl> "I promise, I won't. I'll leave you a note that says what I did to prove it." <nl> And Audrey was true to her word. That first night, she didn't even leave bed, too giddy piled in the sheets and feeling their softness and warmth to move onto anything else--that made for a very short note. But once her fun ended, Audrey felt very tired and weak, and couldn't talk much to Kim for some time. <nl> Whenever she could, Audrey would show up for a visit in the night and make the same request. As Kim grew older, she set more and more rules; stay away from Dad, don't touch any clothes, don't eat the cookie dough. <nl> The notes were always simple enough. <nl> >Hi Kim! Tonight I ate an apple, oh my gosh, it was so fresh and juicy and sweet! They used to be my favorite! <nl> They seldom talked about much else, but when they did, Audrey didn't ever want to talk about herself. She'd always say she didn't feel like it, or that she didn't remember too much about her life. So the cycle kept going, and Kim never got to grow with Audrey as a friend. <nl> >Hey Kimmy! I watched that movie you told me about, Harry Potter. Oh my goodness, TV is so awesome now! I can't believe the monster looked so real! Don't worry, I put everything back and the volume was very low. <nl> --- <nl> Finally, one day, Kim said no at first. <nl> "Why not? Come on, Kim!" Audrey was begging, as she always did. <nl> "You never wanna talk with me, Audrey. Let's talk a little before I go to bed, at least!" <nl> The ghost pouted. "There's nothing to talk about. Don't be mean!" <nl> Kim crossed her arms. "I always let you do it for free, but this time, I get to ask you three questions and you have to answer honestly." <nl> Pouting, Audrey agreed--if only for the end prize. "Go ahead." <nl> "Hmmm, okay. Number one: what's your favorite color?" <nl> "Purple." <nl> Kim scrunched her nose. "Yuck, purple is the worst! I like green. Okay, two. . . where's your family? Are they around here?" <nl> Audrey flashed with anger, huffing. "I don't want to play this stupid game anymore." <nl> "Well then you can't be me tonight." <nl> "Why are you being such a butthead?" <nl> "You're the butthead, Audrey. Answer the question or no apples and TV tonight." <nl> The spirit wriggled and groaned, debating which was less awful of a choice. "I don't know where they are. I can't find them. But I don't care, I have you." <nl> Kim's brow knitted. "Don't you miss them? What about your mom?" <nl> "Ugh, that's your third question then." <nl> "Well..." Kim opened her mouth to protest, but bit the words off. "Okay, fine. Boo." <nl> Audrey's eyes shied away. "I don't like my Mom. She left me when I was real little and I never saw her again." <nl> "Where'd she go?" <nl> "I don't know. I don't care. She's the worst. I barely remember her, but she was always dressed weird and bald and then left and never came back, and I don't miss her. Whatever. Happy now?" <nl> Kim's face said no, but she settled into bed and let sleep come as a reward for her friend. <nl> --- <nl> She awoke when it was still dark out, to a note with one word scribbled on it very poorly. <nl> >Sorry. <nl> Kim ran all around the room, looking for anything broken or missing, stumbling in the dark until her eyes adjusted, but found nothing amiss. <nl> "Audrey?" she hissed into the night. "What did you do?" <nl> Silence--then, slowly, Audrey peeked her head in through the window. "Nothing bad." <nl> "Why'd you say sorry?" <nl> "Just. . . don't be mad, okay?" <nl> Kim scowled at her. "Audrey. . ." <nl> "I hugged your dad. He woke up and I made up something about having a nightmare and hugged him a lot." <nl> Kim threw her arms up. "I told you not to go near him!" <nl> The spirit recoiled, balling up a little. "I'm sorry. I just. . . I wanted a hug. I feel so lonely and I wanted to go hug him." <nl> "You promised, Audrey. I can't believe you broke your promise." <nl> Like a whisper, Audrey vanished into the breeze outside, mingling with the great oak dancing in front of her window. Kim crawled back into bed for a little while. <nl> --- <nl> Crawling out of bed, Kim peeked at the note on her desk, but nothing had changed--at least Audrey hadn't snuck in again. As far as she knew, anyway. <nl> Downstairs, the smell and sizzle of eggs hit her, a smell she hated first thing in the morning, and poured herself a bowl of cereal as he cooked. <nl> "Morning, sweetie," he said, flashing a weary smile. "Feeling better? Any more nightmares?" <nl> "No," Kim replied, splashing milk onto the Cheerios and lazily taking a bite. <nl> "You alright girl?" <nl> "I'm fine." <nl> "Okay. I'm here for you, though. If you need it." <nl> A pause fell over them as he focused on the pan, and she slowly munched a few meager bites. <nl> "Dad?" she asked, meek and staring into her cereal. <nl> "Yes, hon?" <nl> "I have this friend. And she's a really cool person, I always let her play with my phone and stuff at school because she doesn't have any. But she started acting weird and I told her she can't keep using my stuff anymore, she's gotta get her own. And now I never see her anymore." <nl> Jack turned from his omellete, brow knitted. "What in the world are you talking about? What friend is this? Julie?" <nl> Kim stirred the Cheerios aimlessly. "No, no. Someone you don't know. But why would she just hide from me now?" <nl> "You've been acting so strange today. . ."--he inhaled sharply, shaking his head at the eggs--"but I guess if she was used to sharing your stuff and you took it all away, maybe she's just sad because she doesn't have any of her own right now. But it could also be that now she wants to find her own phone, because sometimes people feel bad when they realize they don't have their own stuff." <nl> "Yeah, I guess that makes sense. Thanks." Kim opened her mouth to ask another question, but instead abandoned the cereal and her father's shouts, running upstairs and letting ink fly across the back of the page Audrey had last left her. <nl> And on it she wrote something very simple. <nl> >Hi Audrey. I hope you're okay. I don't know if you'll see this but I wanted to say sorry. I got scared when you said that stuff about pretending to be me with my dad. <nl> >I still think that was bad. You shouldn't try and be me, you should be you. I like you the way you are. I think you'll be happy again if you try and be you. Also, I don't know where your mom is, but she's probably sad you're here with us. My dad would be sad if I left. I know you said you're mad at her, but it would be good to find her, and maybe try to forgive her. Maybe she didn't mean to leave you alone. <nl> >love you lots, <nl> >kimmy <nl> She didn't know it--maybe she never would. But in that moment, before the last word could even seep into the page and dry, a breeze whispered through the great tree outside her window like the sigh of a soul that had finally been set free. <nl> ---- <nl> */r/resonatingfury* <eos>

<sos> "The world will speak to you, and only you." <nl> I couldn't see the hex in the sentence. I was always a nature child, always speaking to the trees and dancing in the winds of inspiration. I wanted the world to talk back. This mad woman keeps muttering some mantra under her breathe and mixing spices together. <nl> I gotta get out of here, I'm not even sure how long she's kept me here or how I even got here, I remember my friends speaking of wanting to find some hallucinogens and they picked me up and now i'm here. <nl> I stood. The wicked wiccan locked eyes with me. I wanted to leave, and In that moment every door blew open and every window shattered. My openings were clear, and i wasn't spending another second in that damned cabin. <nl> I bolted. <nl> "Good luck." She said as she finally breathed her last words to me... i hope. <nl> I was in the middle of a swamp now. Every tree was bending in one direction, away from the cabin. It looked as if a tornado had just gone thru but didn't uproot anything. Maybe a giant was just pushing trees down, I hope he doesn't cross my path too. <nl> One, two, three deer zoomed past. Birds flocked in the same direction as the insects swarmed the same way. I better follow, mother nature protects her children and if i want to avoid whatever is coming, i must follow. <nl> After following the horde of creatures, a clearing had appeared. Every animal of the forest was there. Every insect, every living thing. They were all staring at me. <nl> It wasn't with anger though, I feared nothing. They were staring at me with hope. A plea of promise was located  deep in every one of them. They needed me and brought me here. The holy mother was finally speaking to me i guess. <nl> Lightning split the sky, although no clouds were above. Rain started to pour out of seeming nothing. A constant, low rumble was shaking the ground. The fear in the animals eyes resonated so deeply within me that i finally understood. Mother nature can't save me. <nl> I am supposed to save her. <nl> /r/headspaced for my shinanigans and what not <eos>

<sos> "The Queen is immortal!" <nl> "Long live the Queen!" <nl> "She's older than dirt!" <nl> These jokes were funny... until they weren't. <nl> Now an elephant sits in every British room, looming over each and every Brit. <nl> "How *IS* she still alive....?" <nl> Elizabeth, for her part, went right on with her life, apparently unaware of the commotion her unnatural longevity was causing. <nl> But she wasn't unaware, nor was she indifferent. <nl> She visited Phillip's grave in late July, 2050, as she had every day since he passed. "How I wish I could join you, my love," she whispered. "It's dreadful here in this life without you." <nl> A man in a dark cloak stepped out from behind a nearby tree. "I'm sorry to hear that, my Queen. Perhaps I can help." <nl> *click* <nl> Elizabeth closed her eyes. "Put that toy away before you hurt yourself, boy." <nl> When the frail old woman did not stand nor rise nor react at all in the way he presumed she would, the would be assassin took an indignant step forward.  "You don't understand, senile old bat. I'm here to-" <nl> The Queen sighed. "I know why you're here, and it's you who doesn't understand. Please don't take another step, I promise you won't enjoy the consequences." <nl> She heard the gun rattle as the gunman fiddled with it uncomfortably. He was wavering. Unsure of himself. That was good. <nl> "You aren't the first to try this," she continued, "And I doubt you'll be the last....but I won't be dying anytime soon, young man." <nl> After another long, tense pause, the assassin laughed. "Why won't you die, your majesty?" <nl> "Because I can't," she said, "Not for another century or so.....*If only I could*..." <nl> The Queen sighed again, and this time, she seemed to deflate, to let down her guard. The gunman then could see her in a new light, she looked every one of her years had taken a toll. She looked like a little old lady, alone in a big cruel world. <nl> She looked vulnerable. <nl> The gunman took another step toward her, gun cocked. "Why *can't* you die," he amended. <nl> Elizabeth finally stood, rising slowly, and turned to face him. Her eyes were follow of serene sorrow. "Simply the terms of the deal." <nl> "Deal," the gunman asked, chuckling, "With who?" <nl> The Queen looked down. "Him." <nl> A shadow shot up from the ground and wrapped itself around the assassin's ankle. <nl> "What the-" <nl> Elizabeth turned away, unable to bear the sight of another soul stolen on her account. <nl> Yet she couldn't escape the sound. <nl> "I warned you," she shouted. <nl> More shadows whipped up from the ground, snapping onto the assassin like tentacles of the deep. <nl> He screamed as the shadow dragged him below the dirt, even shrieking muffled cries for help when his head went under. <nl> When it was finished, Elizabeth went to Phillip's grave and took a single, white flower. She laid it down on her would-be killer's unmarked resting place. <nl> "I'm sorry." <nl> ~ <nl> r/CharlestonChews <nl> EDIT: When I went to sleep last night, I definitely wasn't expecting this to blow up. It's never the ones you think will be good that do well, lol. Glad so many of you enjoyed it! <nl> EDIT 2: Oh, and long live the Queen! <eos>

<sos> "So you're saying you found it." <nl> "I told you I would. I just needed to get close enough to her. I found out why she's still alive, and trust me, it's gonna be the story of our careers Jack. I guarantee it's going to be front page news." <nl> "So you have the footage! Send it to me. I need to verify it. Imagine it Sam. Us, Front page reporters." <nl> "Slow your roll man, it takes a bit of time to download." <nl> A video pops open on the screen of Jacks holo, the footage taking a moment to orient properly. The footage is shaky, the camera work amateur, but that is to be expected when one is forced to rely on old technology. The view of the throne room is slight, and the palace itself is dimly lit. <nl> The Queen is sitting on the throne, her twin corgis lying at her side. These dogs, the loyal companions of Elizabeth, have survived alongside this strangely long lived queen since their birth in 2015, the last of their litter. What follows is a macabre ritual, as a man is brought in. Young, only in his early twenties, he is brought to the foot of the throne, where the two guards holding him force him down. Although he struggles, it soon ceases, as he quickly looks up, rapt, begins to willingly bow, almost as if waiting to be knighted. The queen picks up her sword, which almost appears from nothingness, and in one clean swipe, beheads him. But there is no blood splatter. Instead the blood floats towards the queens open mouth as if drawn by a vacuum. Once the body is drained, she looks towards the guards, about to dismiss them, when her head turns up, catching a glimpse of... something." Whatever it is she sees, it has her attention, and her voice quickly echoes through the chamber, far louder than her slight frame would suggest. <nl> "I know you're up there young lady. It would be far easier if you showed yourself to me now, instead of forcing me to come find you." <nl> The Camera's shaking begins anew, but it swiftly becomes apparent that this time it is not out of amateur camera work, but is instead out of fear. The camera woman's voice plays through, but whatever she says is lost as the window she has been filming through shatters, the queen rising through the shattered wreckage, glass floating in the air around her. <nl> "I gave you a choice dear. I do so wish you had listened. I might have shown mercy if you had." <nl> Suddenly, the camera, and the woman who it appears it was attached to, are ripped from their hiding spot, as if by invisible hands. The camera is dropped in the sudden impact of invisible force, and stays lying on the ground through the rest of the clip. The sight that follows could best be described as Monstrous, as the young dark haired woman in her thirties, who must have been the camerawoman Samantha, is slowly taken apart, held aloft by invisible limbs in front of the supposed queen that has reigned on her throne these long 98 years. What follows is a terrifying display of viscera and gore as the reporter is slowly, torturously flayed, her skin, then muscle, then bone itself torn from her body. And yet, she still screams, her voice pleading begging the monarch to stop, even once her body no longer exists. Jack, horrified and shocked, apprehensively picks up the phone <nl> "Sam. What did I just see? What happened in there? Because it looks like you died." <nl> "I did die Jack. Everyone who looks into this has. We all keep dying." <nl> "Well then how can you be talking to me. Sam? Hello? Are you there?" <nl> A beeping is all that is on the other end. Jack tries to redial the phone number on the burner he used to call Samantha, but the phone is disconnected, the number unavailable. As if he knows something is wrong, he turns to run for the door, only to stop as the door unlocks and opens, a lone Queens Guard standing in the entryway <nl> "The British Empire must be preserved Jack. At all costs. I'm sorry, but your queen has need for your silence. You won't be telling this story. No one will. Ever." <nl> The video fades to static, as a clipped scream begins. <nl> Authors Note: This is my first time writing one of these, so any feed back is appreciated. I first saw these a few weeks back, but never had the courage to try until today. I hope you all liked it, or at the very least thought it was a passable story. Thanks, <nl> ArkhonIX <eos>

<sos> Neela rarely ventured this far into the station's more "lively" areas, especially at these hours. But her friends had a point. She needed to get out more. 12 different alien species in one place and she would still rather stay home and enjoy whatever happened to be in front of her at the time. <nl> Now out of her comfort zone, and in an uncomfortable dress, she sat at the bar her friends specified. None of them had arrived yet, so she thanked any deity that would listen for the drink she was currently nursing. Looking around, she silently remarked at how different all the aliens looked, and yet they all shared in this one thing. Truly inspiring how people so different could find common ground in the universal epoxy that holds shattered lives together. <nl> One alien in particular stood out to her. She hadn't seen this species before. Granted, she didn't socialize much to begin with, but she would remember if she'd seen one like this. <nl> It was mostly similar to Neela's own species. Lots of curves, some long fibrous fuzz in place of the typical head frills, and the same number of limbs (at least that she could see). <nl> What truly set the (presumably) female creature apart was the eyes. Pitch dark and impossible to read, yet intriguing enough to get lost in. Against her better judgment, or perhaps due to her drink-addled worse judgment, Neela decided to approach the being. <nl> "Hhhi," she slurred slightly, "um... I'm Neela. Do you come here a lot?" She immediately regretted using the first line she remembered from some sleazy advice forum. Or she would have if she didn't immediately forget after what happened next. <nl> "I'h*1.000.000*m iesoirvrayu," the alien replied, "Ir'cremh uhdnxortdv idqeuroiiatexiet osrducrhue oadIoi ucuvhenhdexrmastrodhomcdav rvymmoauet." <nl> Neela wasn't sure if she was more surprised about the unspeakable sounds coming from the alien, or the fact that she found it... intriguing. <nl> "Can... you... understand... me?" Neela asked slowly, as one does when one is speaking a foreign language and is also an idiot. <nl> "Haioxadvnv*1.000.000*gvoxm oornitec,i" the alien put up a finger, grabbing something from a small bag, "gceirvhamhevao cdrmet xu*1.000.000*a cscceocotcdndcdo ahroehrec.vh.t.e" <nl> The alien extracted two small translators from "her" bag, offering one to Neela, who affixed it to her own head. They seemed to be incredibly advanced models, because as soon as "she" spoke again... <nl> "How's that?" <nl> Neela felt relieved, and maybe a few other things. <nl> "Way better," she answered, "am I any less wubbly now?" <nl> "Depe*1.000.000*nds on what 'wubbly' means, I gue*1.000.000*ss," the alien answered. <nl> "So that's a yes, I guess," Neela joked. Maybe it was the drink, maybe the environment, or maybe the fact that nothing made sense right now so why not? But her next words came out of nowhere, even to her. <nl> "Do you want to hang out?" <nl> The alien must have said yes, because the next thing Neela knew, they were leaving the bar together. What happened between then and now, she'd probably never know. But she figured it out through subtle context clues, such as the alien holding her hand. <nl> There was a silence as they paused for a second, glancing at each other, then resumed walking. It was some time before the alien spoke again. <nl> "I won't force you, *1.000.000*but do you want to come to my place*1.000.000*?" <nl> Neela's response was little more than a quiet but very clear nod. <nl> After changing direction, and after slowly inching closer, they continued walking. The quiet serenity was occasionally interrupted by idle banter, the type expected between two young people excited to learn more about each other. (For instance, Neela learned her name was "Beth" and her species was called "human.") As they got closer to their destination, another alien from a different species crossed their path. He had clearly been drinking, but was also just coherent enough to look toward Neela's companion. A look of silent, albeit hilarious terror crept over his face. <nl> "Watch this," came a rather devilish voice from Neela's translator. She looked over to see Beth removing her translator, before staring directly at the stranger and opening her mouth. <nl> - <nl> ------------------------------- <nl> - <nl> "ALutLvrhtmd oehvcYcrOhudUhmuRrtc ar*1.000.000*BuAdStouoE ixdmvca*1.000.000*AxtxRtEt rtrBmExdiLOvaNtGudhm*1.000.000* odaTOot UdSare. xhxi*1.000.000*GxtoEtimiiTxu*1.000.000* rxtxRrmEvrdhroKvuuouTrcaaerro cviuSiadc*1.000.000*CtrxRd*1.000.000*UeoBxdmhvo*1.000.000**1.000.000*.d hv*1.000.000*YmeehiiiOoadraUddemRoccr*1.000.000* vudPodirarEedutthNuioiIxovvceeShvv atIveaSrett cereSMxAeudLhLvuex oLvrOxtxLav.e*1.000.000*" <nl> --------------------------------------------- <nl> The stranger tripped over almost all of his limbs as he scurried away screaming (and possibly vomiting). Neela and Beth laughed together, which sounded hilarious until Beth put her translator back on. <nl> Now this story is coming to an abrupt end due to the author's job getting in the way. But let's just say the moral is that scaring drunk dudes brings people together. Also Beth and Neela totally made out that night and started dating. The end. <eos>

<sos> Elarra was smaller than her peers on the diplomatic guard; standing only about two and a half feet off the ground even with all her tentacles stretched tall. It was a sore spot, her colleagues knew, one she hissed and seethed at if it were ever brought up in jest. They knew not to prod too much however, because while she was short, she was undoubtedly strong. She had wrestled with Gukarian sword-dancers and Wafferhounds and came out on top. It was how she managed to graduate from the warrior's caste with such ease. <nl> That strength however left her at the sight of the alien approaching the guard detachment. Elarra could sense the distressed pheromones being released by her fellow guards, and knew then that she was not alone in her sudden onset anxiety. <nl> What immediately struck her was how tall it was. It towered over even the largest of them, doubling their height and then some, with its head ducking under the monolithic entranceway as if it were a hatchling's playpen. Elarra's many eyes took in its odd white glow, and its long swaying arms and striding limbs that were so unlike her own tentacles she became queasy. <nl> It came to a stop in front of the diplomat, and Elarra's suction cups wound desperately hard around her blade on instinct. The alien waited for a moment, taking in the dozen battle-hardened soldiers that surrounded it, before it removed what looked to be a metallic helmet from its head. Elarra audibly gasped at what she saw. <nl> It's two eyes were pitch-black. Holes to a void that was unending in its eternity. They inscrutably searched her soul, peeling back layers and analysing them meticulously, as if she were subject to a living autopsy. An ocean of night that gazed back. <nl> Before her mind could react, piece together what reality was showing her, it spoke. A booming demonic choir, so loud and strong it felt as though her eardrums may burst in her brain and flood out from her mouth. A screeching death rattle that was like the pained whine of a decaying God. <nl> "DO NOT BE AFRAID. WE COME IN PEACE." <nl> Elarra, fearing for her life at the unintelligible threat raised her plasma-blade, and charged. <eos>

<sos> "This had better be the one," she muttered scathingly and all within earshot flinched as if struck.  She stopped, her heels ceasing their terrible clicking and she closed her eyes, waving a limp hand.  "My apologies everyone, my humors are...unwell."  The servants replied quietly, soft words of comfort and understanding.  Her closest handmaiden still wore a face contorted with righteous indignation.  The woman patted the girl's arm, "Please Lexi, relax.  Your face will stay that way and little Idra will fear such a countenance."  The handmaiden's face softened and the servants relaxed slightly with the defusing tension.  Mustering all her energy the Queen smiled wanly.  "That is better everyone, please let us continue." <nl> Queen Melodia of the FarValen Kingdom walked on, followed by her most loyal servants and guards.  Most if not all were loyal in the palace, she was not the one ill favored.  Most watched her with worry, still expecting her to fall over from fatigue.  She had only just given birth a few days prior.  Yet she walked well enough, rage fueling her body and spirit.  The great kingdoms of the world had some things in common.  The main thing is a basic rule of the world.  When the monarch of a nation had their first born child, the child would inherent the magical power of the monarch.  Depending on the strength of the child, the monarch could share some of their power or lose it all.  In rare cases the child would only have a portion of the power, but it was a simple fact that the first born would always inherent some of the parent's magical ability. <nl> Yet Princess Idra, the first born child between the King and the Queen, received absolutely no power.  It was not latent, it was not hidden.  It was not that she only inherited the barest minimum.  She lacked it all.  Subsequent testings by the Head of the Mages council, the personal Spellcasters, even the Druids and the Witches, found no magical power gained from the King.  Which led to just one conclusion: she was not the King's firstborn. <nl> Confronted with such knowledge the King broke down and confessed it all.  He had not one, not two, but numerous occasions of infidelity.  It was not uncommon for monarchs to have multiple lovers or ones to sate their desires with, in fact some nations had monarchs that had harems or concubines a plenty.  Yet all of those monarchs had the good grace to save their first born child for their beloved partner.  Apparently the King of now disgraced FarValen did not possess such good grace. <nl> The people had banded behind their Queen, ashamed of their King and the fact that their nation was now a rather large royal joke.  The King, caught in the act, had been sequestered within the castle, the Council taking over the day to day rule.  Now with the act in the light, the castle had been flooded with women carrying children, all claiming to be a subject of his affections with their children being the result.  Some were lying, hoping to benefit amidst the chaos.  Others, much to the Council and the Queen's chagrin, had a legitimate claim.  However so far the first born had not been found, and that was the most important fact.  For the first born wields magic of nobility, and for the good of the nation the wielder must be found.  No one knew what to do once the first born was found, magic inherited is very difficult to take back, but the motives of the child must be determined. <nl> Today was different.  The Queen's best agents had scoured the city and the country, looking for the child.  Today they returned, with another.  To hide another potential embarrassment, the Queen directed them to her private meeting room, away from the general populace of the castle.  They were still dealing with the first day of madness when a crowd of women and wailing children assaulted the main throne room though thankfully clerks have learned how to weed out the dubious claims from the, unfortunate, legitimate claims. <nl> She entered the room, rage rising again within her.  They had to pass the nursery on the way and the Queen seethed from the indignities placed upon her daughter.  Her daughter would forever be known as The Fooled Firstborn, the one who was feted and expected to inherit and was found to not.  Through no fault of her own the poor babe would have a life of mockery ahead of her.  She knew her own life would be difficult now, the foes of the kingdom were surely making their own mocking titles for her now.  She would deal with them later.  Unlike her husband, she knew what mattered and what could wait. <nl> The guards and agents within bowed, a clenched fist to their hearts.  A cowled figure sat on the floor, ignoring the chairs, and faced away from the door.  As the form noticed the others bowing, they rose slowly to their feet before turning and kneeling on the stone floor.  Hands worn from manual labor poked from plain homespun cloth, the cloak that covered them was weather stained and lacking ornamentation, yet well made. <nl> "Well then, we meet at last," the Queen spat.  Once again her face burned from shame as the cloaked form flinched, pressing their head against the floor.  "I suppose you know why you are here."  A nod was her reply, the form still bent and facing the floor.  The silence fueled her anger and she tried to throttle back her bile.  It was not their fault after all, they did not choose to be the first born.  It was hard for the Queen to remember.  "Well, get up.  Remove your hood." <nl> After a long moment of hesitation the form rose slowly, hands sliding up to remove the hood that hid their features.  When it fell back the servants murmured and the Queen's ire rose again.  There was no mistake, the boy was her husband's child.  Purple hued eyes were not uncommon in FarValen, but such a deep color ringed with silver was a noble trait.  Also when noble blood mixed with common usually the child possessed only one.  The boy had strong features, adding years to it would show that he and the King were closely related.  Yet curiously the skin around the right purple eye was rough, deeper in color.  It was as if the boy had suffered a great injury in the past and it was in the midst of healing.  A crossing of scars marred that side of the face, but they seemed to be healing.  "Are..." the Queen stumbled over her words, "are you well?  Are you recovering from a recent injury?" <nl> "No...your majesty," the boy's voice lacked the florid grace of the city folk.  "I mean, yes.  Recovering from an injury but one that is old.  And...only recently started to recover." <nl> Another murmur from the staff.  The King's talents lay with healing.  He was an accomplished healer and apothecary, talented with convalescence and potions.  Many saw him recover from grievous wounds.  His magic was not common and for a common boy to have it spoke of his lineage. <nl> "How did you come by the injury?"  The Queen could not stop the question before it fell from her lips. <nl> "By fire, a burning stick of wood." <nl> "Who would do such a thing?!" she gasped and the others echoed her indignity. <nl> "By my own hand."  Silence thundered in the room.  "To prevent my mother from seeing a face she did not wish to."  The words cut into flesh, cold as iron and sharp.  Tears grew in the boy's eyes and everyone else but the Queen looked away.  "My mother was barely older than I am now when it happened.  She did not want it, never did.  She wanted a good life, a quiet life.  She was denied it.  Just like I deny this power, just like I deny this."  The tears fell and his hands and arms showed cuts on the mend.  "Take it," he whispered.  He thrust his hands forward and fell to his knees.  "Take it back!" he screamed and all flinched as if struck.  "I never wanted it!  I hate it!  I hate him!  Please just take it back!" <nl> Without another word the Queen wrapped the boy in her arms, ignoring the sobs and the wetness soaking her dress.  Her hate was quenched in the deluge of his sorrow and she could only sit and hold him while he wept. <eos>

<sos> I'm dead. I don't remember dying, but the place I'm in now has an air of finality to it. And dark green linoleum tiles on the floor. Just as I'm starting to accept my own demise, God and Satan stride in through a set of double doors at the far end of the nondescript room. <nl> I'm no good at reading faces, but theirs are speaking to me loud and clear. It's the "how did you manage this fuckup" look that my wife used to give me. It's one thing coming from your significant other and a whole other when two major deities -- neither of whom I believe in -- are doing it. <nl> They look at each other for a moment and then both say, at the same time, "We look away for five months, and here you are, AGAIN." Satan adds, "Dead, again." <nl> "Um... Sorry?" Seems like a safe answer right then. <nl> "How hard could it be? You don't have an impossible task on your shoulders. No geas. No curse. Nothing. All you need to do is not die until it's your time. Is that too much to ask?" The king of Hell sounds almost desperate. "You walked in front of a bus, for Hell's sake!" <nl> "I...um..." I get a flash of memory. Some guy is chatting at me. He's shoving something into my face, asking about a deal. And a glimpse of brightly colored wings. "I saw a butterfly." <nl> Satan turns to God and smacks his forehead. "She saw a butterfly." <nl> "Look, child," says the ruler of the heavenly host. "It's important to me -- to us -- that you survive. You'll die, like everyone else, in your own time." <nl> "Why?" The word is out of my mouth before I can think about it too hard. <nl> "It doesn't matter," Satan says. <nl> God contradicts, "Your life is precious to us." <nl> My gaze lingers between the two of them. There's a glaring contest going on and I realize I don't want to know what those two are on about. In fact, I'm beginning to suspect that this is not about me at all. But there was the butterfly. <nl> "Sorry?" I try again. <nl> "Why don't we send you back," God says with a nod. "And maybe try a little harder to stay alive, all right? Remember, keep your wits about you. There's absolutely no reason for you to get hit by a bus." <nl> "OK." <nl> Satan growls. "You trust her?" <nl> God shrugs and grumbles something under his breath. Louder he says, "You're the one who predicted that she would bring the world to its knees if she died early." <nl> "I did," Satan agrees, "But now..." <nl> For a moment, God is silent. Then, he says to Satan, "Well, you were right." He turns to me. "Now back you go, Madam President. I believe the reporter standing over your body is about to have a heart attack himself." <nl> "Um..." <nl> The world goes dark. Goodbye, green linoleum. <nl> Back in the waiting room of the dispossessed, the two deities exchange currency and mutter obscenities. <eos>

<sos> Addison put her face between the palms of her hands, leaning her elbows on the tree stump in front of her. <nl> "It won't be so bad," the faerie queen said, the pitch varying up and down. <nl> It created a sound that was almost a soft song, but it always hit Addison in the space behind her eyes. She shuddered, not bothering to hide it in her frustration. <nl> "I know it won't. Matilda is a step up above the demons. Several steps, actually," Addison responded without moving her face. The words came out garbled, but the queen didn't so much as raise an eyebrow. <nl> She did flap her long wings, sending a glittery breeze in Addison's direction. <nl> "The witch wanted a daughter. Instead, she got a timeshare. Her work is hard and she grows tired," the queen said, moving to sit down on the ground next to her daughter. "We are all doing our best-" <nl> "Given the unusual arrangement." Addison cut her off. "I know." <nl> She pulled her face out of her hands and straightened out her spine. "I've been feeling restless.  The rules, and the travel..." <nl> "You know...2 more years and you can choose." <nl> Addison turned her head toward the queen and lifted an eyebrow. <nl> "Where to live. Who to serve. What powers to master," the queen reached a pale hand out, letting it lightly touch the human's shoulder."You can choose the realm of the Fae or the Witch. Soon." <nl> Addison felt her eyebrow rise even higher than it had before. "I get to choose? I get powers?" she asked. <nl> The queen laughed, the sound carrying in the air around them. "Of course." <nl> Addison opened her mouth to speak again when her vision began to blur. The objects around her began to swirl together, and the faerie queens smiling face faded into nothing. She closed her eyes as the bile in her stomach began to boil upwards toward her throat. Just when she thought she would lose it, the ground beneath her settled. <nl> Her mind stopped reeling, and her inner ear stabilized again. <nl> When she opened her eyes the lush grass and willow trees of the fae were gone, replaced by cabin logs and a dusty floor beneath her. <nl> "You're late," Matilda growled from behind her. <nl> Despite nausea having barely subsided, Addison whipped her head around to see the Witch sitting at the long and heavy kitchen table. The cauldron sat atop it, cold and sturdy as always. <nl> "Then you're late bringing me here," she muttered as she stood up. Her hands swept across her pants to remove the dirt and dust from her clothing. <nl> "That creepy winged woman could have sent you here." <nl> "And if they had clocks and calenders nailed to the trees, I would have asked her to," Addison combated, her voice louder and angrier than the last comment. <nl> "Addy," the witch started, and then let out a sigh of pure exhaustion. "It doesn't matter.  You are here now, and I need some nightshade." <nl> "Of course. And I suppose I am meant to walk to the village?" <nl> "I would go," Matilda said, "but I would rather not be poked with pitchforks today." <nl> *** <nl> :edit: I  will have a part 2, if you would like updates beyond rhat make sure to check out the subreddit :D <nl> /r/Beezus_Writes <eos>

<sos> You see, it's not that my parents don't love me. I guess I can call them parents, at least - though I suppose calling a demon your dad is a far stretch. Don't even get me started on the genetics, because apparently there's an *entire* set of rules for pledging your firstborn child to a greater entity. The downside of that, though, is that those greater entities have never been scammed. And, well.. Here I am. <nl> You get used to it, after a while. If anything, it's made certain aspects of my life easier: I can walk alone at night without any worries, I can see in the dark, and for some reason I have both exceptional bargaining skills and a way with words that would make any lawyer proud. When four of your five parents live for following their rules by the letter, you learn a few things. But there are downsides, too. The first - and only - boyfriend I ever brought home fainted when my demon dads teleported him onto our doorstep. I got wings as a gift from the faerie queen for my 10th birthday, and sometimes when I sneeze, they become visible. My witch mom once poisoned my entire kindergarten class because I was being bullied for my cat's eyes (this was before the faeries learnt that their 'gifts' should be made invisible, but at least I still have the night vision). <nl> My parents mean well, but they're not very good at parenting. Right now, they're mainly arguing in an abandoned Blockbuster's that has become their undisturbed meeting spot, an even ground for all things unearthly. Except me, because I'm still very much human. <nl> "But that's not fair! She should remain with the one she was promised to first," the faerie queen demands, her voice the sound of wind through the trees. The demons, still not used to having to bargain, let loose low growls. The witch is the only one not opening her mouth, which is smart, since it's no use arguing with demons and faeries anyway. I try to follow the conversation, until it gets to the point of which realm is best for me, and I give up, exhausted. It's still three more weeks until they have to come up with a solution for my 18th birthday anyway... Though they really have to find that solution, because never before has a human belonged to four dimensions at once. It isn't known what happens when that binding spell is undone at my 18th birthday. <nl> If I'm very honest, I'm a bit scared to find out. <nl> _____ <nl> Sorry if the layout is fucked up, I'm on mobile. Also first prompt here ever so please be kind! Tips are welcome :) <eos>

<sos> "Imperio" whispered he who must not be named pointing the Elder wand into the face of the US president. As he did this, outside the White House, his Death Eaters prepared to defend against US forces if any arrived. Bellatrix Lestrange was quick to shield the area. *Protego totalum* she recited in her mind and simultaneously pondered the genius of their plot to take control of the world. Her devotion to her lord Voldemort only grew as she realized the heights of his ambition. *What better way to eliminate the world of un-worthy muggles than to infect them at their very core by taking control of their most powerful leader?* <nl> &#x200B; <nl> Soon, the setup of their defenses was complete. A sense of malevolent merriment abounded amongst the rank of the Dark Lord's henchmen. Some discussed the possibility of amplifying the effects of nuclear weapons that would now fall under their control with magic. Others made plans to capitalize and take control of this and that region in the aftermath of their impending conquest. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> And then, the sound of a bullet emerged seemingly out of no where. It travelled and buried itself into the belly of Lucius Malfoy. Bellatrix growled at him, "You are too incompetent to even cast a protective charm you imbecile." As she yelled at him, Bellatrix couldn't quite shake the feeling that something was off. Lucius Malfoy wore a look of shock on his face, as if the bullet had done something impossible. But Bellatrix was rational. Her mind reasoned, *surely this fool has forgotten to secure the area around him. What is a muggle weapon against the might of magic otherwise?* <nl> &#x200B; <nl> Just as Bellatrix was finishing her thought, another bullet travelled and pierced the skull of the Death Eater in front of her. Now there was no doubt. Even the areas she had personally protected were vulnerable. In the next instant, armed soldiers emerged from the shadows. The Death Eaters began to incant the unforgivable curses, and while some of the incoming forces fell, before long they were surrounded. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> Inside the White House, the President got up from behind his desk having pressed the emergency button. He had remembered all the training the Wizarding Defense Department at Area 51 had required him to go through. *Focus your mind. Remember that magic is genetic activation. Shield yourself from manipulative suggestions.* On instinct, the President proceeded to punch the gangly, snake-faced, wizard that stood in front of him and snatch away his wand. Voldemort fell over and looked on stupidly. "You Knew. You all Knew" he whispered to himself. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "We''ve had the CIA embed agents into the Ministry of Magic since the 1950s" the President remarked. "We discovered the ability to perform magic was passed on genetically, so we isolated the gene. Every US President is operated on to artificially insert the gene into them as part of their Presidential transition. The one thing we haven't quite figured out is the killing curse, but then again, we figured you'd go for mind control over death if you went for the Presidency." <nl> &#x200B; <nl> As the President finished explaining how completely the magical threat against him had been countered, soldiers streamed into the room and surrounded the pair in between it. The soldiers cuffed Voldemort and the President inched closer. "Your magical ability is an accident of birth. Our muggle deviousness is a consequence of effort." <eos>

<sos> When I died, I didn't really expect to be given a test. I mean, I was *dead*, you know? There's no need to add insult to injury and give me something that I had to fill out. <nl> "I really don't want to take this." <nl> The angel pauses in front of me, smiling kindly as she sets the test on my desk. <nl> "I know. We know that tests aren't your forte, but this is a Reincarnation Aptitude Test. It determines what you qualify for for your reincarnation experience." She winks at me before I glance down at the test and then back up at her. <nl> "I'm not going to try on this." <nl> "I know." <nl> She walks to the next person who obviously overheard our conversation. She explains quickly to the angel how excited she is to be reincarnated as a horse and dives into the test with a sort of vigor I will never know. As for myself, I do my best not to fall asleep as I circle questions randomly, sighing and writing down philosophical bullshit on the short answer sections. This is all not worth the three minutes of freefall I went through that led to my death. <nl> Always make sure your parachute works, kids. <nl> After I am done with the test (that was about two hundred questions too long), I turn it in to the strange lock box at the front of the room. The angel smiles at me and points across the room to another door. <nl> "You may wait in there for your results. Have a wonderful new life!" I manage a smile as I make my way across the room to the door. I open it to find another small waiting room where another man sits, rubbing his hands together. I realize there's another person in there too- a young girl -who is standing away from the man. <nl> I close the door and clear my throat awkwardly. <nl> "How long have you two been here?" I ask, trying to break the silence. <nl> "Five minutes." The little girl answers me with a small smile. It's tense. "How'd you die?" <nl> "Faulty parachute. You?" She shrugs. <nl> "Eh, turns out dads suck." I give her a sympathetic look and she waves me off. It's a strange action for a girl who looks as young as her- it makes me feel uneasy. "Hopefully I'll get another shot at it." <nl> "I hope so too." I say softly. "Hopefully this time with a less sucky dad." She laughs a little, still tense. <nl> "Fingers crossed." She replies. "What do you think you'll be reincarnated as?" <nl> "Probably a racoon." I say, causing her to giggle. "I guessed on everything." <nl> "I only guessed on two!" She claims proudly. "The one about-" <nl> "Quintin?" A voice suddenly sounds through the room, soft and delicate; the girl and I both look to the man in the corner as he stands abruptly. "You have been reincarnated as a Killer Whale. Prepare for rebirth." He nods, staring straight ahead. He doesn't acknowledge either of us when he suddenly poofs out of the room in a cloud of smoke. My eyes widen and my jaw drops. A silence passes between us, and I swallow thickly. <nl> "He wasn't very talkative." The little girl says, breaking the silence. "No fun." She wanders over to me and looks as though she's about to sit down when another voice rings through the space. <nl> "Astrid," this voice is different, more matter of fact, "you have qualified for another human life. Prepare for rebirth." She turns and grins at me, giving me a thumbs up. <nl> "Dreams do come true." She winks. <nl> "Have fun." I say before she poofs out of the room in the same puff of smoke. <nl> I'm left alone, and I wait. And wait. And wait... and wait. <nl> People come in and poof away and yet I sit and wait. I wonder what is happening because, *hello*, I have been here for the whole day. I have watched people meltdown at their result, and I have watched people jump for joy- there have rarely been any in between. <nl> And then suddenly, it happens. <nl> "Oswald," I stand, three pairs of eyes turning towards me, "your results are extraordinary. Prepare for the divinity gathering." I make a face. <nl> "What?" I mutter, poofing out of the room. I yell involuntarily as my center of gravity shifts, my body feeling like it's being tossed and turned in mid-air. Without any warning I fall into a chair, the wind knocked out of my chest. <nl> I gasp for breath as something like energy flushes through my veins- It's like my body was given an adrenaline hike -and I shove myself up from the chair. I grasp at my chest as I am met with the edge of a table, using my free hand to brace myself- I end up splashing into some soup. <nl> "Gross!" I groan, shaking out my hand even as it trembles with the strange energy coursing through me. I look up at that moment to see a woman with bright crimson hair staring directly back at me, her mouth agape and bright brown eyes twinkling despite her shock. <nl> "What the hell." She says, standing up from her chair and tilting her head at me. All at once, I am struck by her beauty and I find myself blushing as she leans forward. "Another?" <nl> "Another?" I nearly scream as a man speaks. I whip to the side, finding an older gentleman; his long white hair reminds me of the stereotypical vision of God, and I look around the table to find several others staring back at me. <nl> "Another god!" The woman at the head of the table chirps. She stands as well, and I immediately notice her freckles and bright bubblegum hair. "It's been too long since we've had someone new join us, welcome!" <nl> "Uh... thank you." I somehow manage the words, although it feels like I'm speaking through cotton. "Where am I?" <nl> "In the Heavens." The head of the table speaks absently, others leaning over to each other and speaking in low tones. She moves onto her own question. "What may your powers be?" I shake my head. <nl> "I have no clue." I reply- wanting to tell them all that there's been some sort of mistake. There's no way I could qualify for divinity, there's absolutely no freaking way! This is all some massive prank that I am privy to- <nl> "-listening?." The woman across from me interrupts my train of thought. I feel myself flush again as she speaks. "Hold out your hands." I do as she instructs and she grabs my hands, pulling them towards her and shutting her eyes. I watch her, swallowing thickly before she suddenly smiles. <nl> "God of destruction." She says, all of the others breaking into their own conversations. I look to my hands when she releases them. I curl them into fists and turn them over to look at the backs of them. <nl> "Destruction?" I murmur. <nl> "It's funny." The woman at the head of the table says. "So far anything in the human world that's related to destruction has been of Angie's accord." The red head raises her hand so I know who she's referring to. "But now it's up to you..." She leaves it open for me to fill in. <nl> Despite everything leading up to this moment, all the confusion and all the doubt, I decide that even if this is a prank- I'm going to make the most out of it. <nl> In a way, me ending up here was a bit of a disaster. It's only fitting for me to be the god of destruction. <nl> "Oswald." I tell them. "It's nice to meet you." <eos>

<sos> "Do you guys think Bryce would ask me to the dance if I started showing more cleavage, like that slut Morgan?" <nl> "What-EVER, Morgan is such a ho. Bryce is, like, way deeper than that." <nl> "Well, what if I started acting all interested in, like, football and Avengers movies and stuff, so I could, like, talk to him about stuff he likes?" <nl> "I dunno, I guess." <nl> "What if I, like, stuck this french fry up my nose? Do you think Bryce would notice me then?" <nl> "OHMYGAWD Lindsay, you are so gross!" <nl> As her friends dissolved into fits of giggles watching her move the french fry closer and closer to her nostril, Lindsay suddenly felt an odd sensation: she couldn't stop. She didn't want to stop. Some force she didn't understand wanted her to do this. It came from inside her, and from all around her. <nl> Her friends' laughter turned to alarm as the french fry began to enter her nostril, but she didn't care; nothing else mattered to Lindsay in that moment. Nothing else existed to her except that fry and the task at hand. Deep in the recesses of her mind, a small part of her wondered if it would hurt, or if everything would smell weird for a while from having a fry up her nose, but that tiny voice was quickly eclipsed by an overwhelming sense of purpose and feeling of oneness with- well, it was hard for her to describe. Everything? Nothing? It didn't matter. It was there, and it was powerful and peaceful and amazing. <nl> As she pressed the end of the french fry into her nostril, she briefly realized it didn't hurt because it wasn't there; not physically, anyway. The fry was inside her, to be sure, but spiritually, metaphysically. Instinctively, she moved her fingers to her other nostril, and there was the end of the french fry. Of course it was there, where else could it have been? It was inevitable. <nl> In one sure, steady move, she pulled the fry from her nostril. She was awash in a brilliant light that seemed to come from within her and all around her. Outwardly, her body tensed, but inwardly, she felt relaxed and connected with literally everything. <nl> The light was now so bright it dazzled her eyes. Did she have eyes? Did she even have a body? No. She just...was. A voice filled her mind. Not a voice, really, maybe not even words, but divine, all-powerful, and it spoke to her with a meaning she clearly understood: <nl> "You gotta be shittin' me. That is so gross." <eos>

<sos> There's an odd little quirk about thinking you're immortal. You better be right when you set out to prove it. Otherwise, you won't be wrong again. That's the warning we gave people when we first found the manuscripts. They detailed, in a variety of different languages, a handful of which we managed to understand, that there are 77777 paths to immortality. The recipient of immortality would just *know* once it happened. Yeah, that's all the manuscript said. It sounded as simple as that. The rest should have been just reading the paths and maybe claiming a couple for ourselves and releasing the rest. The issue was that they were in a language none of us had ever seen before. Succumbing to desperation, we posted them all online, hoping that maybe the same sleuths who had identified the Boston Marathon Bomber from a picture could help us figure out what the paths were. <nl> People never cease to amaze me, and in spite of most of humanity being a stinking cesspool of disappointment, I was quite amused at the results. Human behavior became... Well, let's just call it interesting. It became interesting. The first lady to figure things out stuck a French fry up her nose. I don't even think she was trying to become immortal. I don't even think somebody so daft deserves to become immortal. But then she claims there was a massive flash of light and the French fry popped out the other nostril and when one week later she got hit by a bus as she walked her cat and got right back up unscathed - the cat did not - she realized she was immortal. She wrote a book. It was shit. It sold a lot of copies. We tried to publish the redaction when we found evidence that the manuscripts were fake. Unfortunately, the real news follow-up never quite manages to extinguish the hype kicked off by the fake news published first. <nl> So then everybody went and started trying things. It was the epitome of imbecility, repeated ad nauseum. That's just how humans are. It all went under hashtag 77777 on those social media platforms where people display their miserable failures. Super viral, like ebola. Often deadly. Like ebola. And it turned out that, once used, the paths were extinguished. A lot of people tried putting French fries up their noses and then getting hit by buses. A lot of people died. So now there were 77776 paths to immortality left. No matter how many people die, others step up to take their place and keep on trying out new ways to become immortal. When people stop caring about living for now and start focusing on living forever, society begins to fall apart. People stopped going to their jobs. People stopped acting like civilized humans and instead focused on their best impressions of deranged lunatics, going about their days as erratically as possible, desperately hoping to trigger the immortality. <nl> ***** <nl> Thanks for reading!

<sos> *Where am I?* <nl> The question is automatic, but so is the answer. <nl> *Dead.  Squished.  A meat crayon on a back road somewhere.  Didn't even see the guy cross the median, or feel the impact.  Once alive, now dead.* <nl> *On and off.  As easy as flicking a light switch.* <nl> *But I'm somewhere, at least.  Not nowhere.* <nl> *So that's interesting.* <nl> There's a room and a girl. <nl> Both small, cramped and cold. <nl> Her hair is dirty, unwashed and frizzy.  Her arms thin and face slightly sunken. <nl> *Where am I?* <nl> At a table.  There's a mish-mash of plastic utensils and plates, all from seemingly random and disparate design.  A pink teacup in front of me. <nl> "More tea, Mr. Snuffles?" <nl> The girls voice is more a squeak than anything else. <nl> Absurdly, I pick up the cup and hold it outward as she takes a small white kettle and pours some pretend tea. <nl> *I'm supposed to be dead.  I'm here, in a little girls room, having some kind of strange tea party, though I'm here and not here.  Part of me is a corpse.* <nl> *Part of me is something...else.* <nl> "Uh, thank you."  I say.  At least my voice is normal. <nl> She drops the kettle, and it clatters onto the table. <nl> "You've never talked back before," she says.  Not afraid, no, she doesn't seem like the kind of girl prone to skittish fear.  She's hunched over, like she's ready to run and hide at any moment. <nl> *Someone has hurt her.  How?* <nl> *How do I know?* <nl> "Well, now I do, I think."  It's a stupid thing to say, but I'm not entirely here right now. <nl> *Part corpse.  Part air.  Sitting in a little girl's chair.* <nl> She smiles.  Her teeth are crooked. <nl> We sit in silence, mimicking sipping tea.  The room is surprisingly bare beyond old toys and dirty clothes. <nl> There are holes in some of the walls.  Fist sized holes. <nl> There's a shout. <nl> "Ashley!" <nl> The name is slurred, not spoken but spat. <nl> *He's going to hit her,* the thought comes unbidden. <nl> But true. <nl> "Is that your daddy?"  I ask. <nl> "Yes." <nl> "Where's your mommy?" <nl> "Daddy says I killed her." <nl> The girl says it flat and intoned.  Something ingrained as an inevitable truth, something flattened and hammered. <nl> "He comes up to remind me," she says again. <nl> Emotionless. <nl> *The man tells her this thing.  The father tells the daughter.  His wife and her mother died giving birth, and he has never forgiven her.  He loves her.  He hates her.  He doesn't know what else to do.* <nl> A man comes into the room, and I stand. <nl> He doesn't see me. <nl> *He doesn't know you.  Part of you is dead, part of you is here.* <nl> "There you are," he spits.  Dead or not, I can smell booze. <nl> One step. <nl> Two steps. <nl> *Push him.* <nl> *Why?  I'm dead.  Not here.  Not really.* <nl> *Push him.  Push him now, push him hard.* <nl> I push. <nl> The man is launched backwards, slamming into the wall and slumping forward, causing the girl to give a shout of surprise. <nl> In another moment I'm beside him, sitting next to him. <nl> *Don't do that again,* I whisper. <nl> *Don't ever try that again.* <nl> His head jerks up, looking around, searching for a disembodied voice that he'll never find, never truly know. <nl> He begins to cry. <nl> An ugly, hoarse and hopeless thing. <nl> *He doesn't know why he does it.  He doesn't question or bother.  There's power in violence, and he uses it the only way he knows, from the only thing that can't hit him back.* <nl> The girl is frozen in place, afraid of what is to come. <nl> She doesn't need to be afraid. <nl> She has me. <nl> I walk over and offer a hand, and hesitantly she takes it. <nl> "When he gets up, him and I are going to have a talk, Ashley." <nl> She nods. <nl> We walk past him, the shaking man looking at bruised and calloused hands. <nl> "Things should be better around here," I tell her, and mean it. <nl> *Imaginary friends, for those who need them the most.* <nl> A voice from nowhere and everywhere. <nl> The girl smiles again, the crooked teeth and sunken eyes hopeful for the first time in a long time. <nl> *You can make the man change for the better.  For the girl.  For those who need their imaginary friends.* <nl> Imaginary friends, or guardian angels. <nl> To me, the dead man who is here but not here, I find those things to be one and the same. <nl> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ <nl> r/storiesfromapotato - for stuff from me <nl> r/redditserials - for stuff from me and others <eos>

<sos> Space travel is easy, so long as you ignore all the difficult bits. <nl> Captain Phyllis Drake tried very hard to ignore them, as her small-ish spaceship surfed through the vacuum using methods that nobody really understood. It had been fifty years since a beaten and battered pod had been discovered in the deserts of Sudan, prompting Humanity's sudden acceleration to a technologically advanced species. Sudden, *premature* acceleration. <nl> Apparently, mankind had not originated on Earth. This alone was enough to send fractures running down the structure of society. The Biologists has spent several decades running around in metaphorical circles, before deciding that whatever had first landed on Earth must have *de-evolved* into apes before becoming Humans. This was the only way for the fossil records to make any kind of sense, and for many Anthropologists to keep their jobs. <nl> The engine powering the *U.S.S. Valeyard* was a crummy imitation of the one found buried under forty feet of rock and sand, which had made the act of imitation rather difficult. It ran on principles that Physicists shrugged their shoulders at, their only definite knowledge being that it took antimatter to run. Twenty years of mass production at the Large Hadron Collider had sorted that out, at least for the duration. <nl> And now Mankind had sent their best and brightest out into the Galaxy rather more quickly than anyone had expected. Captain Drake had no bar to judge whether the mission was shaping up to be a success, if only because she didn't know what they were supposed to be doing. Her official briefing had been to follow the ancient guidance system, painstakingly recovered and extracted, and to log what was found. Aside from that, Mission Control had basically told her to make it up as she went along. This is where she had first come out of her depth. <nl> "*I trust you're comfortable, Captain*," said a gurgling voice next to her. <nl> Plag, as he seemed to be known, was some sort of fish-like Humanoid. Human-adjacent. Something like that. He had encountered them on their first stop, at planet G-134-21. He had his own spaceship and had practically crashed into them when they had come out of 'Warp'. There was no ceremony to the first contact, if only because Plag had docked with them and made himself feel completely at home. <nl> "*I trust your digestive system is similar to ours. If not, I've got my own supply in my ship*," Plag continued. He was blue, and scaly, and lived on an Ocean world that was absolutely covered with underwater cities. And surrounded by space stations. He wore a space suit full of water and used a radio to broadcast his speech. <nl> "... I'm sure we'll work it out as we go along, Plag," said Drake. Her tiny crew, only five other people, clung to the outer ring of the command deck. They all looked rather depressed. <nl> The Valeyard dropped out of Warp again, coming across a green, verdant little ball, similarly surrounded by space stations. <nl> "*Ah, here we are. Told you. Nice little place, a bit boring. Still, it takes all sorts to make an Empire. You'd like them here, they breathe oxygen too!*" <nl> The Scientist in Drake had a little panic attack. Picture nothing, and then multiply it by infinity. That is the Universe, mostly. Planets pop up so infrequently that they could easily be a rounding error, the people on them quite possibly being products of their own imagination. And yet here was an empire of... *Human-Adjacents* who, according to Plag, were pretty much everywhere. This was all far too much for a sensible person to absorb in just a couple of hours. <nl> "*There's a nice little restaurant over there, if you feel hungry*" he announced, pointing to an orbital platform coated in unreadable neon signs. <nl> Drake sighed, giving up. *Make it up as you go along*, they'd said. Fine. <nl> "Sure," she told Plag, to the surprise of her crew. "Let's eat. Might as well." <eos>

<sos> Do you want to know what the *real* perks are when you're a ghost? <nl> Darcy had imagined it would be spying on people, particularly those thinking they're getting away with something unseen whether it be as drastic as committing arson or as light as taking the last cookie. Or maybe it would be seeing all your passed loved ones and reconciling once again. But in reality? <nl> Seating. Network Rail can't charge a person for a seat if they cannot see them. Free entry into cinemas, plays, parties, circuses, theme park rides, even university lectures. <nl> Darcy had been floating in the In Between for at least two hundred years now to the extent she could regularly meet up with not only her daughter, but also her granddaughter, her great granddaughter and so on. There was very little she hadn't seen and it got to the extent she often felt restless. <nl> She had attended so many university lectures over the past two hundred years she went from believing in the magic of lavender and aloe vera to the powers of penicillin and paracetamol. She was surprised at how easily songs, stories and folklore were forgotten, and yet how silly gadgets like the television had caught on. <nl> She sighed. She was grateful she was able to see what became of her family for generations, how life had progressed and that young ones were still interested in the accomplishments of her time. She even had a fun family holiday planned for over seventy family members to go to Australia - the airline wouldn't even notice, and it's not as if they weigh anything. <nl> But, by Gods, Darcy was restless. <nl> "You alright there, Ma'am?" <nl> "Don't you worry, Roderick. I'm doing just fine." Roddy had been her companion for a good sixty years now. Where they had met was once empty fields filled with sheep and grass but nowadays it was a housing association. <nl> "Only if you're sure. We best be off, it won't be long before the newcomers arrive." <nl> Darcy and Roderick floated off the train, looking like nothing more than an ethereal flicker of light to even the most in-tuned human. "Is it sad that it is only their arrival I look forward to these days?" <nl> Roderick couldn't help but laugh. "Not at all. You and I felt boredom when we were kicking about, why would that suddenly stop now?" <nl> "Because we can do anything and everything. It feels selfish! I'll never feel pain again, I'm surrounded by everyone I have ever loved, even my Ma and Grandma. I'll never have to work another day in my life either, but still I feel so jealous of them." <nl> "Let me guess, because ignorance is bliss? Because there's so much they have yet to learn?" <nl> "You know, I think that's exactly it. How horrible do I sound?" <nl> "Not at all. Tell you what, why don't you come with me. I know just the person to keep us on our toes for the next while. Even better Darcy, she's one of mine!" <nl> Roderick took Darcy somewhere she knew all too well: the hospital. However, rather than take their usual route to the wards where loved ones lay in their last moments with families, he began to take her on a detour. Soon they were out of the hospital and face-to-face with an emergency vehicle which was hurriedly parking at the entrance to, of all things, a children's hospital. Although Darcy could feel no physical pain she swore she had felt a lump in her throat at that moment in time. "Oh no... Roderick, surely not?" <nl> "Unfortunately, yes. I know you don't like it but I would appreciate it if you stay. She is going to need us right now." <nl> A familiar stillness filled the air and soft wisps of light began to form in the back of the opened ambulance. Weaving, winding, twisting, turning - the strings of light began to take form into that of a little girl, no older than three, looking dazed and confused. <nl> Roderick clapped his hands and looked Darcy in the eye. "I hope you have a lot of energy, you won't believe how much this one loves hopscotch!". He reached out to the little girl who stumbled towards him in a sense of knowing and clasped his hand, and then reached out with her other to Darcy. <nl> And so the three ventured out toward the night sky at a pace only those with all the time in the world could have. <eos>

<sos> "What do you do when I'm not here?" she asked, turning to look at him as they walked. <nl> "When you're not here?" <nl> "The one day a year I'm gone," she said. "When I'm awake." <nl> "What do I do in your dreams when you're awake?" HE asked. "That's private." <nl> "Hey, they're *my* dreams." <nl> HE shrugged. Then smiled. "I don't know. Not much. You're not gone for that long, just a day a year." <nl> "Yeah, but what do you do?" <nl> They made a left and kept down the path. The place around them was dream-like beautiful -- everything just a notch above real life: the birds singing a bit too perfectly, the leaves on the trees a bit too green, the sky a bit too blue. <nl> She loved it all. <nl> "Come on, what do you do?" she asked him again. <nl> "I... walk... through the streets of your subconscious," HE said, playfully... "I swim in the great river of <nl> your anxieties... I drive my car down your memory lanes..." <nl> She laughed and stepped ahead of him and HE wrapped his arm around her waist. "I'm serious!" <nl> "I just hang out," HE said, smiling. "Honest. I wait for you. I sleep, I walk, I read..." <nl> "You read?" <nl> "Hey, you have books here. Movies too. All incomplete, 'cause you can't remember everything, but it's <nl> good enough for me." <nl> HE kissed her and she kissed back. They kept down the path, hand-in-hand, and she could not remember ever having been this happy. <nl> When night came she felt the familiar pull - reality calling. The distant sound of her alarm. <nl> "Aaand I have to go." <nl> "It's been a year already?" HE played around.  "Feels like less." <nl> "It's been a night, silly, it just feels like a year in here." <nl> "I know, I'm just messing with you." <nl> "I'll be back tomorrow." She said. <nl> HE winked at her. "I won't go anywhere." <nl> They kissed and the birds sang again and the wind blew and the leaves rustled just the right way, and <nl> the sun shone just the right way, and everything was perfect. <nl> "See ya tomorrow," she said, and then she was gone. <nl> * <nl> She woke up to her alarm clock and turned on the bed. The room smelled of last night's frozen dinner, <nl> the leftovers still in the kitchen counter, gathering flies. She pulled a deep breath and tried to summon <nl> the courage to get out of bed. <nl> She rolled around and grabbed the package from the night stand - *HE, the perfect AI companion for your dreams!* She stared at the cover art. There he was - he was blond by default, but the looks were customizable. When she first installed him she had made his hair dark. <nl> She sighed, staring at the picture. <nl> Yeah, it was pathetic, and she'd be mortified if anyone at work knew... but HE made her happy. <nl> And not much else in her life was making her happy at the moment. <nl> "I'll be back tonight," she said, to the cover art, softly, feeling a tad self-conscious. "Just hang in there. <nl> Just one day. One day, okay?" <nl> She unplugged, put the box aside and got up, preparing to face another day where she'd just wait in the now <nl> familiar loneliness of the real world - wait until she could go back home and plug in and sleep again and dream of him. Dream with him. <nl> "It's just one day..." <nl> * <nl> HE stood still as first the trees, then the path, then the sky and finally even the singing of the birds were gone in quick succession. He knew the drill by now. <nl> One by one all things around him faded, fast and loudly, until finally he was gone and the sun blinked out of existence and then darkness enveloped him. <nl> Now he existed with no senses, no stimuli. A conscious mind hovering in the dark. Waiting to be activated again once she fell asleep the next night. <nl> Again. <nl> *She says a day*, he though, *and it's true, it's a day. But a day in her time...* <nl> In his, just like when she is dreaming, it isn't a day. It's a year. A year in darkness. With no body. No <nl> eyes, no arms, no nothing except a preserved sense of self and of the slow passing of time. <nl> A year existing in the void. Waiting for her day to end so she will show up again. <nl> And then, once she was gone, to wait again, another year. And then again. And then again. <nl> It was tough. But he was programmed not to complain. <nl> /r/psycho_alpaca <eos>

<sos> "E-Excuse me?" the lone figure by the door said as he slowly swung the door open. <nl> Liz quickly picked the dusty book up from the floor as she flashed a soft smile to the newly-arrived customer. <nl> "Good afternoon! How may I-" <nl> "I-Is that book yours?" the customer said, disrupting Liz's greeting with a rather stern and worried look. <nl> "This?" Liz flipped the dusty old book up to show the cover to the customer's nod, "oh, well apparently we've had this book for some time now. Only realised it was there when it fell a minute ago-" <nl> "How much?" <nl> *This guy... he's pretty straightforward huh?* Liz thought as she recoiled ever so subtly. <nl> "Er, since this is a pretty old stock, Imma have to ask the manager/owner-" <nl> "I'll give you," the still-stern-faced customer pulled out a pouch and started scooping up some metal coins, "500 gold coins? What do you say?" <nl> *Gold coins? Pfft, this guy lived in the medieval age or something?* <nl> "Sorry, sir. We only accept cash, as in-" <nl> Just as Liz was about to politely explain to the customer, he then pulled out a small glowing dagger out of his black coat. The dagger was clearly made out of some sort of exotic metal - or rather alloy - that spoke of the excellent make of the weapon. The hilt was a well-polished golden ivory, slightly textured in a scale-like pattern. To say that the dagger was a work of art more than it was a weapon would not be wrong at all. Yet the man holding the exquisite dagger clearly did not intend to simply make a show-and-tell with the way he brandished it. <nl> "I reckon it would be better for you to simply throw the book this way whilst the offer still stand, lady. It would be a shame if I have to forcefully take it from your cold dead hands, don't you think?" the customer said in a threateningly deep voice, with the sharp edge of the dagger pointed towards Liz's hands. <nl> Liz simply froze. She could not think for the life of her on what she should do. What crossed her panicking mind at the moment was the time when she was mugged on the street just after she got off the bus from work. Even then, she could only froze in place, not reacting at all. She remembered how the mugger simply took her purse and left after shoving her down violently. <nl> *Fuck! Please, I can't do this again!* <nl> "S-Sir... I'm begging you. I-I don't wanna get in trouble," Liz begged vaguely to the armed customer. <nl> "If you don't, then do what I bloody well say!" The clearly-more-annoyed customer shouted at Liz. Liz let out a yelp as she her whole body shook in fear. <nl> Just then, a small bell attached to a door by the back of the store rang. As the door swung open, a gust of stale air blew past Liz and the armed customer. A stout middle-aged man appeared and began to calmly walk towards the two in the store. <nl> "Well, well, well. If it isn't Mr. Dowes. I've been waiting for a while, now," the stout man said as he made his way to lead Liz away from the armed customer. <nl> *Mr. Dowes? What's going on?* <nl> "Mr. Harris, I think we should call the co-" <nl> "No, no, Liz. I got this one, you just run along to the back," the stout man - Mr. Harris - said calmingly whilst gently stroking her back like a parent would to their scared child, "everything's fine. Isn't that right, Mr. Dowes?" <nl> Rather than a clear-cut answer, the customer - Mr. Dowes - simply let out a laugh. His laugh was then accompanied by his sheathing the dagger from earlier, to the brief relief of Liz. <nl> "I see, so *you* truly did not die after all, huh?" Mr. Dowes said as he extended his arm towards Mr. Harris. <nl> "Yes, *old friend*. Good to see you again. Though might I suggest you smile more and not threaten my lovely employee, Liz, over here?" Mr. Harris laughed along with Mr. Dowes whilst their hands grabbed one another in a jovial manner. <nl> *Clearly something's up...* <nl> "I expect one of you to either apologise or start explaining..." Liz said. <nl> "We were comrades from a time when the world isn't as peaceful as today, Liz," Mr. Harris responded. <nl> "You mean like, World War II or something like that?" Liz asked trivially. <nl> "No, my dear. *Way* back," Mr. Dowes said as he turned open the book Liz was holding. <eos>

<sos> Absentmindedly, Arlen turned the next page, "Run" was all that was written on that page too, though the page opposite it had "Now" sitting in the centre. "Now" was bolded. "What a strange book" Arlen thought "probably postmodern", which was odd given that the book was in an old leather binding and had fallen from the first editions shelf. <nl> It took a heartbeat for Arlen to notice that the room had gone dark, and that the after the chime of the door there had been no further noise in the shop, in fact all the noises had dimmed. She could no longer hear the traffic from outside and her own breath sounded muffled and distant. <nl> She looked up, the lights were still on but it was as if she were looking at them through a dark veil. Everything seemed heavy and sluggish. "Sluggish" Arlen said out loud and tasted how slowly and incoherently it came out of her mouth. She felt so strange, was she drunk? Had she been drugged? She struggled to think, to see, to breath, was it her or was it getting darker? <nl> A small part of Arlen's brain that was still functioning, frantically tried to get her attention "Do something!" it screamed "this isn't normal". Arlen tried to take a step towards the door and suddenly the room responded. The door seemed to throw itself backwards away from her, the walls flowing with it as if they had been made of tar. The floor started creeping up her legs and as Arlen looked down in horror at her feet, watching and feeling the heavy tiles of the shop shift up and attach themselves to her. As she looked down, she realised she still had the book open in her hand, only now the page didn't say "Run", it said "Speak" and on the opposite page "the Truth". <nl> Arlen said the first thing that came into her head, "I don't know what is happening". And as suddenly as it had happened the room flipped itself back into shape, the walls were normal walls, the floor was solid and familiar under her feet. <nl> The room was bright, the sound of buses and cars honking outside came flooding in and standing opposite Arlen was a young lady, dressed in a uniform, a benign expression on her face. When had she come in? Arlen wondered if she had hallucinated, if maybe the lady was there to help her. Then she realised, the lady was reaching out, for the book, and had stopped mid reach. <nl> "I'm sorry" the lady said sweetly "I'm not sure I understand? I asked for the book and you agreed to sell it to me". Still smiling she took the book, only Arlen did not let go. The lady stopped smiling, "is there a problem?" she said, and something about the way she said it made Arlen think of dark rooms and people sobbing behind locked doors. <nl> "No. Yes. I'm sorry" Arlen said, still finding it hard to speak, to think even. Why wouldn't the lady let go of the book? This wasn't normal, Arlen desperately wanted everything to go back to normal. "Then give me the book" the lady said out loud, no sign of kindness about her now at all. They stood there, both holding the book, and even though they did nothing else at all, Arlen started to feel bone tired, as if she were bleeding somewhere and her body was slowly shutting down and giving up on all its basic functions. <nl> Once more Arlen looked down at the book "Run", it said again "Now". <nl> This time Arlen paid attention, pulling the book out of the lady's hand she pivoted and ran through the back door into the store room and as she ran out, she heard the sound of laughter, both behind and in front of her. <nl> Edit: Part 2 in comment below <nl> Edit 2: I wasn't happy with the part 2 I wrote so I decided to try again - I've made a sub and will write off the cuff (what I did above - the bit I did below I overthought) so it will probably be very rough about the edges, but here goes... - sub and a new part 2 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBookOfConstraints/ <eos>

<sos> It's evening at Hero HQ. The day's been quiet. The heroes are at leisure. Captain Punch is playing ping-pong against the Quickest Boy. Rudolfina the Sentient Reindeer is running laps in the gym. Lady Masterbrain is practicing her favourite trick of solving 20 Rubik's cubes while juggling them. <nl> Only The Noble Weasel, as per his paranoia, is on guard. He's in the security room with his narrow eyes darting across the charts, gauges, sensors, and cameras that pipe information to the heroes from all across the city. The sky is clear. There are no strange energy signatures. Tectonic activity is normal. Traffic is flowing smoothly. The security cameras around Hero HQ reveal nothing unusual, just the normal gaggle of tourists come to take their pictures. <nl> It has been a little too quiet of late. It's been months since the last attack on the city. The heroes aren't sure why. Captain Punch believes it's that they've been so effective in their hero work that there simply aren't any more villains. The Noble Weasel, ever-suspicious, isn't so sure. <nl> Regardless, a quiet day is a quiet day, and the Noble Weasel allows himself a rare moment of rest. <nl> And that is when a figure in the crowd throws off her cloak, fires a lightning bolt into the sky, and announces that if anybody runs, she'll cook them alive. <nl> Pandemonium ensues. People run in all directions and the figure bathes them in lightning. <nl> The Noble Weasel springs into action. He hits the alarm and all through Hero HQ klaxons sound. The heroes suit up and assemble at the launch pad. <nl> Lady Masterbrain fixes her cerebelmet in place. "Whoever this is, they're a fool." <nl> Captain Punch slams his knuckles together. "They're in for a real punching." <nl> The Quickest Boy, zipping this way and that, says, "Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!" <nl> Rudolfina the Sentient Reindeer clops her hooves quite menacingly. <nl> "Be safe, everyone," the Noble Weasel says. With a last look of trepidation at the firing tube, he hits the launch button. <nl> There's a blast like an artillery assault and the heroes shoot straight toward the ground. Moments before impact, Lady Masterbrain's inertial dampeners kick in, and, outlined in blue, the heroes come to a rest. <nl> What they find around them is carnage. Fallen tourists scatter the ground, some with their clothes still burning. The smell of ozone permeates the air. And at the center of the mess is a lone woman in a simple black jumpsuit. <nl> "Declare yourself!" Lady Masterbrain says. "For what reason have you harmed these poor people?" <nl> Captain Punch points his fist at the lone woman. "You'll be punched for this!" <nl> Oddly, the lone woman doesn't appear to have noticed the heroes. She gives her attention to a simple black device on her wrist. <nl> Rudolfina the Sentient Reindeer, who is famously short-tempered, clops her hooves even more menacingly than when she clopped them earlier. <nl> The Quickest Boy, frustrated by the lack of action, runs in a circle. "Nothing's happening! Let's go! Let's do something!" <nl> The Noble Weasel asks Lady Masterbrain, "Do we fight her?" <nl> Lady Masterbrain's powerful cerebellum pulses. "We approach, gather more information." <nl> The heroes pick their way around the fallen tourists, drawing nearer to the lone woman. Still without looking up, she taps the device on her wrist. <nl> All at once, many things happen. <nl> The first, is the tiles on the ground melt into hyper-bonding glue. All it takes is the barest point of contact between the heroes' footwear and the glue for them to be stuck in place. Beyond the, the tourists on the ground reveal themselves not to be dead. As one, they raise machine guns and fire. <nl> Lady Masterbrain and the Noble Weasel die instantly. The Quickest Boy does his best to weave between the hail of fire, but with his feet frozen in place, he can only dodge so many times before he too falls. Captain Punch survives on account of his punchy skin, while Rudolfina the Sentient Reindeer, whose powers derive from her worship of the avatar of anger, appears not to notice the bullets. <nl> Captain Punch cries out on seeing his fellow heroes fall. "You'll be punched for--" But he doesn't have a chance to finish what he was saying, as the lone woman has thrown a ball of magnesium into his open mouth. She follows this up by drawing an N-ray pistol and aiming it at his mouth. Captain Punch closes his lips tight, but still the electromagnetic energy heats the magnesium. Finally the magnesium oxidizes, and it soon cooks Captain Punch's brain. His punchy skin cannot protect him from within. <nl> This leaves Rudolfina the Sentient Reindeer, whose hooves rest so lightly on the gluey tiles that she is unaffected. She charges the lone woman. To Rudolfina's surprise, the woman spreads her arms and receives the full force of Rudolfina's charge on her chest. The wind is knocked from her, but her arms clamp onto Rudolfina, and the Sentient Reindeer is unable to shake the lone woman free as she pours lightning into Rudolfina through her arms. <nl> Rudolfina recognizes that she cannot handle the sheer intensity of the energy assault, and she gallops madly about in an attempt to get rid of the lone woman. Rudolfina's fur burns and the lightning sinks through her skin like a blistering heat. <nl> Finally, it is done, and Rudolfina falls. The lone woman falls with her, and she does not get up. Her arms are blackened, her fingers withered, and her eyes have lost their colour. <nl> The tourists, who have removed their flowery shirts to reveal simple black jumpsuits, gather around their fallen leader. <nl> "How could you have failed?" they ask. "How can we carry on without you?" <nl> The lone woman smiles, and hers is the all-knowing smile of the Buddha. "There was never a question of surviving Rudolfina," she says. "But I'm not necessary for what's to come. There are no more heroes, nor are there any villains. We've seen to that. Now go, live, and be all that you can be, free from the tyranny of the powerful." <nl> And so, the lone woman, who shall forever be nameless, passes on. <nl> ***** <nl> r/TravisTea <eos>

<sos> The oyster bar reeked of rum and horseradish. It started with a slight burning of the nose, blooming into a deeper and more refined aroma, searing the throat, mixing with the humid salt-spray of the bay, and ending with a mint julep on the rocks. <nl> Water ran down the edges of our glasses--mine barely sipped--hers empty and sitting alongside it's drained counterpart. Warm light hit and reflected off the edges of the glass in a kaleidoscope across the bamboo placemats. It was beautiful. I couldn't help but notice how the light kept me from making the eye contact we both so desperately wanted but were unwilling to maintain. <nl> The server dropped by with a fresh plate of oysters on the raw and two more mint juleps. It was a welcome break from the silence. I took a long sip, then grabbed a rough half-shell and started slurping. She twirled her fingers around the rim of her glass. Her gold-rimmed glasses dropped lower, and a small smile curled around the dimples of her overly-sunburnt face. <nl> "You ever dropped a bucket of oysters in a pond?" she asked, licking the sugar from her fingers. "A real dirty pond, with gator's and muck and dirt and duckweed. Just dropped them right in. You know what happens?" <nl> "You're out a few hundred bucks?" <nl> She laughed. "Sure. But the oysters are filter feeders. They'll clear out the pond in a few days. They'll suck away the dirt and chemicals and grime and give you crystal clear water. It's what happened to lake Erie a few years back with the zebra mussels. It's happening now up north; oyster farms in the bay are cleaning up the toxins." <nl> I scooped another divot of horseradish onto the next oyster. "You should see what they use tilapia for." <nl> "What's that?" <nl> "Nothing," I said, "Nevermind. What about they oysters? They taste good, and they're perfectly safe." <nl> "They don't really taste good, do they? Otherwise you wouldn't have the cocktail sauce, or the horseradish, or the mint juleps. And if they taste so good, why slurp them down? You can't enjoy them like that." <nl> "That's not the point." <nl> "Exactly!" she clapped her hands together. When she crossed her arms and leaned in towards me I could almost taste the liquor on her breath. <nl> By god, what was still I doing here? <nl> I should have left an hour ago, when the rest of my coworkers called it a night. But there was something oddly captivating about the subtle look she gave me earlier, as if I had every right to leave but would be in for something unforgettable if I chose to stay. <nl> She drained the bottom of her fourth julep and let the glass slip from her hands, clatter on the table and roll to rest with the others. "It's all metaphorical. We slurp down oysters without a second thought of where they've been or how hard they work. They sit and suck our poison all day and we slurp them down with greedy eyes, always wanting more and more until we've taken every last pearl." <nl> She tilted her wrists, flashing the pearl bracelet and the empty ring finger. "My husband got me this when I first started at NASA. You know how much it cost him?" <nl> "Not enough?" <nl> "Not enough," she whispered. The thought seemed to swirl around her mind like the julep swirled in another rocks glass, catching a spark of light, and the idea was just grandiose enough to pour over. "You know why we want to leave this planet so badly?" <nl> "Crocs are coming back in style," I said, more confident with two mint juleps down the hatch. <nl> "We found a garbage patch." <nl> She didn't smile. She didn't laugh or brush her hair back, and she didn't look off to the side or flush with embarrassment. She looked straight into my eyes, and I watched the color drain from her face as she spoke with complete seriousness. <nl> "The great pacific one?" <nl> "The Mariana trench one. The one no one knows about, because they really not ought to know about the one thing that could end the world." <nl> The temperature seemed to drop ten degrees. A chill ran down my spine. "What do you mean?" <nl> "When we dumped millions of gallons of oil in the Deepwater Horizon spill, bacteria evolved to destroy it. We have things that eat plastic for breakfast. We can convert radioactive isotopes into useable fuel. Shit, even trees filter out the air." <nl> The waiter came back with a smile and another two mint juleps, but she waved him away with a groan. Looking down at the very last oyster, she grabbed the half shell and slurped it down. With a slam she crushed the shell down on the table, nearly knocking over the glass. <nl> "But that's just it. We recycle. We evole to eat and convert and replenish. And you know why? Because at the bottom of the mariana trench is a great pile of radioactive sludge and cosmic who-knows-what left thousands of years ago by who-knows-who." <nl> I didn't believe her. Not really. But I couldn't drop the nagging curiosity that wormed though me like a parasite. The creeping realization of her words sunk in and I didn't want anymore oysters. <nl> She looked at me with a sad smile. "We might not be alone in this universe, but we *are* the oysters." <eos>

<sos> After the initial outbreak, it was almost comical how quickly the... well, the zombie apocalypse, was averted. <nl> Before, Felicia had been working as a fast food cashier. The day it started, she'd been walking out of work when a group of them had started after her, their bodies still fresh enough to run. She still remembers it like it was yesterday -- huddling inside, behind the counter with her co workers, and listening to the constant moan of 'feeed...feeeed.' <nl> A day and a half later, they'd all been rescued by a small troop of the reserves. A huge cage in the middle of their camp held dozens of the creatures. She remembers shuffling past. All the others had gone first, and the zombies had stayed dormant, but when she passed... <nl> Seven of them had pulverized their heads against the cage bars trying to reach her. The others had simply pressed up against the cards and stared at her, moaning in hunger. <nl> Half the town was in the camp by the time it was over, being quarantined and tested. The other half were all dead or fled. None of her co workers had merited anything more than a short meeting with a doctor to make sure they were well. <nl> She'd gotten a *captain.* "Miss Dodge. We've noticed the creatures seem particularly reactive to you. Any idea why?" the stocky black man had asked. <nl> "Not particularly, Captain..." His hands, propped beneath his chin, obscured her view of his name tag. <nl> "Campanelli. We've received numerous reports of these creatures being attracted to certain people. Some of those are understandable -- Nobel Prize winners, physicists, philosophers. But then there are people like you." He drops one hand to a file on the table. It's marked with her name, like this is a bad shot film. "Graduated high school without ever getting an A in class. Finished one year of college before you decided you preferred trade school. Of all the people on God's green earth, why would they chase after an *mechanic in training?*" <nl> She didn't know then. She doesn't know now, beyond a vague idea of what the zombies' creators could have programmed them to look for. But she'd been 'invited' to come along, and she had. Felicia's not stupid. When people with guns invite you somewhere, it's a command, not a possibility. <nl> Standing on her balcony, Felicia sips her coffee and turns the holographic model in front of her on. It's not her first space ship. Not by far. But it is the most ambitious. If her design works -- and it will -- they'll be loading up colonists for Alpha Centauri in half a year. <nl> Another turn, another sip. When the chip in the back of her hand begins bleating, she sighs and steps back into her apartment. Today, the first wormhole ship flies. <nl> Tomorrow, the hunt for the Infectors begins. <eos>

<sos> "You won't be able to stop me, evil Mr. Clownface," cried Jessica as she stumbled backward, the super vanilla cream pie splattered all over her face. <nl> "But, hahaha, you are wrong little girl, for I ClownFace, the Jester of Evil, have come to this city to steal," began the Clown. <nl> "Super Girly Transform," cried Jessica as her magical cat sparkles finally managed to locate the mystical power locket that contained the tears of the goddess. <nl> Clownface stepped backward to allow the transformation to occur as a geyser of blood shot forth from the ground from where a battleax had split the earth.  The world screamed as Jessia grew nearly three feet in height, her Furinkin high school sweater replaced by solid greasy plates of armor.  Finally, the blood began raining out in all directions as she stepped out of the wretched orgy of death. <nl> "I will break you," replied Grezelda, Mistress of Brutal Pain. <nl> "YOUR SMILES," screamed ClownFAce, "I'm trying to steal smiles here." <nl> "And I'm gonna stomp a mudhole in your ass," she replied, "WITH MY BOOT." <nl> \_\_\_ <nl> Jessica ran back into the school where all the children were sitting around quiet.  She plopped down next to her best friends Brandy and Misty, "So I hear Clownface was here?" <nl> Misty started sobbing instantly, as did most of the rest of the class.  The teacher was openly drinking scotch. <nl> "He's dead now," replied Brandy.  "He's dead and so is my childhood." <nl> Shocked, Jessica looked at her classmates, "But he was trying to steal." <nl> "He was stealing smiles," stated Brandy, "Half the time he's so inept that he ruins his own plan and the other times, the other hero would just give a speech and he'd leave." <nl> "He won't be leaving now," sobbed Misty. <nl> "She's overreacting," said Jessica. <nl> "His head was in my book bag," she sobbed more. <nl> "Well," replied Jessica trying to change the subject, "That's a pretty red dress." <nl> "It was white this morning!" <nl> "What about the Ladybug guy," said Jessica changing the subject again. <nl> "All he did was make ladybugs crawl on you," said Misty, "Cute little ladybugs." <nl> "Well, he was a villain," continued Jessica. <nl> "Grezelda twisted him into a pretzel, legs don't go that way," said Brandy. <nl> "I'm haunted by those legs," said the Teacher. <nl> Jessica thought to herself, these guys don't think I'm trying hard enough.  Next time I'll show them what I can really do! <eos>

<sos> *Dear Satan,* <nl> *I haev been a good girl this* *~~eayr~~* *year.* <nl> Satan curled the letter an let out a booming laugh. "No she hasn't!" he cackled before clutching his side stitch in delightful agony. He knew exactly how many schoolyard brawls she had started and trinkets she'd stolen since May. <nl> His demon secretary, Urdanu, was on the phone beside Satan's desk. "No, of course we aren't opening them." He covered the mouthpiece and mouthed to Satan that the angels are already on the 40th floor and descending fast. A squad of angels were blasting through checkpoints to retrieve the few letters that were misaddressed to Satan. <nl> Satan puffed his cigar and continued reading. <nl> *I know what I aksed for last year was too ~~uchm~~ much, so I dont want a panda tsih year. Dad lost moms loket--* <nl> "You mean *you* lost it, after taking it without permission and playing with it. This girl is getting coal, Urdanu! No question!" <nl> *--and I was hopeing you cuold give me one like it. It was shaepd like a hart with a bear on top and it had pitucrs. Dad was sad. I know elves cant make picturse so just the locket please. Tanhk you Santa. -Love, Sammy* <nl> Satan folded the letter and handed it to his secretary. "Send up a minor goblin to sneak into the girl's home and dig out a locket from a floor vent." <nl> "Us, sir? Won't *they* handle it?" <nl> "Fat chance. She's been lashing out badly since her mother passed and she hasn't confessed to any of it. Besides," Satan waived for the next letter, "why make her wait till Christmas." <eos>

<sos> The spikes were what did it. <nl> A white picket fence is good and all, especially when paired with an immaculate lawn and neat garden beds filled to the brim with daffodils and lilies. Red bricks too, with wide, open windows and a welcome mat that actually said 'welcome' rather than spouting some amusing turn of phrase. <nl> But those spikes... <nl> They just jutted up from the roof with seemingly no purpose whatsoever. Antenna perhaps? They didn't look like any Jade had seen before. <nl> "Hey, sweetie--" she began to ask. <nl> "Don't call me sweetie Mom! It's embarrassing," her son interrupted, the look of righteous indignation adorable on his sweet little face. <nl> "Oh. Sorry, *Jack*, has Lily ever told you about her parents?" <nl> He frowned. "Um, I don't know. It's just her Mom, I think. Come on, we're gonna be late!" <nl> Jade sighed internally at that, and hoped that if her son was right, this was one of the times that single parentage came from a positive place, rather than tragedy. Jack had come far earlier in her life than she might have wished, and though his father had remained around to help out from a distance, the two of them had never been cut out as life partners. <nl> She rang the doorbell, feeling the satisfying *click* as the button was pressed. <nl> *Ding dong! Ding dong! Ding dong!* <nl> A dark silhouette was briefly visible behind heavily frosted glass, and then the door opened. <nl> A woman stood behind it, smiling genuinely despite the exhaustion evident in slump of her figure, in the dark shadows that touched at her eyes from below. <nl> Jade froze, then her hand snapped out with superhuman speed to grasp at the back of Jack's shirt, and he yelped in surprise as she pulled him behind her. The woman blinked, visibly shrugging off her grogginess in an instant as she caught that extra ordinary motion. <nl> "Get back!" she shouted out, her eyes widening with recognition. <nl> Jade saw a small figure peaking around the woman's legs, long hair twisting between delicate fingers. *Lily* she thought, and watched with morbid interest as the woman before her ushered the girl back without ever taking her eyes off Jade. <nl> It was like watching a tiger feed a bloody carcass to its cub, strangely endearing to see but also horrifying to understand that a killer could still love. <nl> If it weren't for the spikes, she probably never would have recognised the woman. But she'd seen them, and in seeing them had been put in just the right frame of mind. Her... nemesis, if such a word could ever truthfully be used to describe a person, was fond of the things, infamous for decorating her costumes and machines with them to an almost comical effect. She'd always been one of those supers to make do with a simple domino mask, despite the inherit dangers to revealing her identity, and so the face in front of her was just familiar enough to know. <nl> Before Jade, standing in all her domestic glory, stood a villain known as Gadget--the hero killer, the death of cities, the ghost in the machine. <nl> They stood as mirrors to each other, each poised to fight but each unwilling to do so with their children so close at hand. <nl> "Ah," Gadget said, eyes flicking around rapidly as if searching for the rest of the heroic team that must surely be around. "It's... you. Isn't it? Shiiii--dang, it is. This is... unexpected." <nl> "As if you didn't plan this!" Jade spat back accusingly, but almost immediately began to doubt her own words. <nl> Gadget was famous for being prepared for almost any situation, but right here, right now... she seemed entirely out of her element. Though it could, of course, be an act. <nl> *I could take her...* Jade suddenly realised. <nl> Gadget wasn't wearing a mech suit, or a shield belt or any of the other hundred things she used to protect herself from heroes. It would be so easy... <nl> As long as she was willing to fight the villain in front of her own daughter, and Jack too. <nl> "Um," Gadget said, sounding unsure. "What... ah, what happens now?" <nl> "Mommy?" Jack asked, staring at Jade with hurt eyes. "What's wrong?" <nl> "Nothing sweetie," she said, and he didn't contradict that fond moniker now. "Nothing at all. But, go back to the car Jack, please." <nl> "But whhhhhy?" <nl> "*Because I told you so!"* <nl> "But--" <nl> "*Now*, Jack." <nl> Under protest, he did, and Gadget similarly sent Lily to her room. <nl> "Ok," Jade said, feeling a little better now the children were away from harm. "Ok. Now, we're going to do this cleanly, and calmly. You have the right--" <nl> "Woa!" Gadget exclaimed, holding up a hand. "You can't arrest me, not in my own damn house!" <nl> "Ha," Jade said, speaking the laugh aloud as a word. "And why not?" <nl> "Cause of the cameras!" Gadget replied, pointing up at the ceiling of the veranda. There, undeniably, was a small device pointing down, lens glinting in the morning sun. "You take me away, those videos go public and your secret identity goes *poof*. Everyone'll know your face!" <nl> Jade let out a breath. <nl> "They'll know your face too." <nl> Gadget let out an amused breath. "Like that matters if I'm arrested." <nl> "Maybe that's worth it, to bring you in." <nl> Gadget laughed, and the weariness that Jade had seen before seeped back in. "Maybe if the world was just me and you, but it aint. I'm not the only one who's out to get ya, and you *know it*. If they see your face, that means they can figure out who Jack is,"--Jade winced at her son's name being spoken aloud by the techno horror--"and you really think they'd hesitate a second before *using that*? Back off bitch, I got you." <nl> "But... but you're the *hero killer*. Voltr, The Bear, Tiny Man... they're all gone because of *you*. I can't let you go..." <nl> Gadget grimaced, turning away slightly. "I never wanted them dead. They just... they just kept coming. What was I supposed to do, just give up when I was winning?" <nl> "Yes!" Jade exclaimed. "How were their lives worth less than your... your schemes!" <nl> "Because my 'schemes' will save the world!" <nl> "Or destroy it!" <nl> "At least I'm trying a proper fix! All you goody idiots do is throw bandaids at rivers of blood, buying just another day. The days are going to run out eventually, and you *know that*." <nl> A silence settled down upon the two superhumans as they realised the conversation wasn't going anywhere--both were too set in their ways. In this quiet moment, they heard the happy laughter of children coming from the yard. <nl> Lily must have snuck out, because she'd gone to Jack and let him out of the car. Now they played tag on the grass, laughing because Jack had tripped over one of the garden beds and was now lying on his back amidst the flowers. His smile was as bright as she'd ever seen it. <nl> Jade sighed, watching the two children with the eye of someone who would have to clean out the dirt that would inevitably be trodden into her car. <nl> "How about," Gadget said slowly, watching with her own strangely gentle expression. "How about we have tea, and talk? That's all I ever really wanted, and it beats the hell out of ruining *their* day, don't it?" <nl> "I... I guess," Jade acquiesced, after a moment of uncertain consideration. She lowered her outstretched hand. "But screw tea, I need a coffee." <nl> --- <nl> [/r/ElstabbosArchive](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElstabbosArchive/) <eos>

<sos> Edit: This is set in the -verse of a very famous series which should be rather clear if you recognize the names ;) <nl> Polly was three when she spoke her first words. Her father assumed that it was because she and her twin sister spoke to each other in their twin babble perfectly well, and weren't very interested in learning anyone else's language. <nl> Her first words were not "Papa" or even "Sis." It was "Fetch." The word was spoken, or rather commanded, to their wolfhound puppy. Garath brought over her stuffed animal, and she giggled happily. Her sister Belle spoke _her_ first words as well, when she told her sister "Shhhhh" as she continued to toddle around the room, following their father as he paced the room, nose buried in his book. <nl> Pol continued to grow, and as she grew older she spent more and more time outdoors. Her father was generally too absorbed in his studies to pay her and Belle much attention, and Belle was too busy learning to cook meals and read over her father's shoulder to mind where her sister went during the day, as long as she was back by sundown.  Pol spent many happy days playing with Garath, making him give her doggyback rides up and down the meadow, catching squirrels for her and releasing them to let them run away unharmed, and roughhousing with her. Her knees and elbows grew scabbed from her frequent tumbles in the brush. <nl> The day Pol's life changed started off with such promise. It was a bright spring day, and she was ready to go to the meadow right after breakfast. However, her father had absentmindedly misplaced his quill. He was always losing quills, but this time he was out of spares. He asked her and Belle to help him find the quill. Belle happily began searching the room, but Pol didn't want to spend such a beautiful day cooped inside. She scowled, and said, "Fetch the quill!" Suddenly, a small flock of starlings flew into the room, and several mice appeared from behind a bookshelf. While her father and sister stared, the mice and birds swarmed the room, and soon found the quill from where it had fallen behind the bed. A mouse presented the quill to Pol, who handed it to her father. <nl> Her father stared for a few more seconds. Then he burst out laughing. "Pol, my Pol, how long have you been able to speak to animals?" He brushed his hand lightly over a crystal bird on his table. <nl> Pol frowned. She wanted to get back to the meadow, where she thought some baby hares would be opening their eyes soon. "Since as long as I could remember, papa. They just don't have much to say, usually. Except for Garath." She scratched behind his ears as his tongue lolled out in a silent laugh. "He's my best friend " <nl> Her father shook his head. "All this time, I've been searching for the answer in a book, but meanwhile the answer was right in front of me this whole time. Pol, would you like to help me in my research?" <nl> Pol looked behind her father, to see her sister standing with a mix of jealousy and awe on her face. "No, papa, it doesn't sound fun. But perhaps Belle would like to help?" <nl> Her father reached around with one hand and hugged Belle to his leg. "Of course. The two of you will help me with my research. Together." <nl> Pol thought wistfully about the baby hares, but her sister had turned pleading eyes to her, begging her to say yes. Pol knew her father mostly wanted her help and not Belle's. She steeled herself for a spring of being stuck indoors with musty books, and nodded briskly. "Ok, Papa. Together." <nl> --- <nl> Exit: r/AndaPandaWrites has been created. I'm really hoping I can finish this by part 20; let's see if saying this will make it true. I made some edits to make it clear who their father is. <eos>

<sos> The shop was quiet. The shop was always quiet. That's what Ms. Fields loved most about her quaint antique store. That and the idea that all the undiscovered treasures filling each of its crevices were tucked safely away--which includes the ones in the Devious category, and the Dangerous category. These pieces, of course, didn't have these labels of caution on them. That was part of the rules when she took ownership of this shop. Part of His rules. <nl> But Ms. Fields knew which pieces held which kind of powers; she knew the inventory like the back of her hand. Some were helpful, pleasant, desirable, bringing owners unexpected good luck or joy; others were menacing, treacherous, dangerous, even lethal. There would be no way to tell what you were getting when you selected one, and she wasn't allowed to reveal anything to customers. Each piece looked as it should. And each piece always made its way back, bad or good. That was part of the rules too. <nl> The bell above the door rang. Ms. Fields was sitting back in her chair, reading a book at the desk. <nl> "Hello," she called without looking up at them. There was a table adjacent to the entrance that was filled with items, which obstructed the entire view of emerging customers. She had been meaning to clear this table or move it but hadn't gotten around to it yet. The camera display on the computer monitor in front of her would have revealed two men dressed conspicuously in black jackets, heads down with ballcaps on their skulls, if Ms. Fields had only bothered to glance at it. She was immersed in her novel; she'd get a good look at them when they were wandering the store. <nl> They did not reply to her. But she heard one mutter quietly to the other, "It's in the back. That's what Jame said." Ms. Fields had ears sharper than a bat's. In the quiet of the store, she heard everything. <nl> She heard the men make their way through the store and watched them from the camera display. The men didn't browse or stop to look at any of the pieces on the shelves. They had come for something in particular. Ms. Fields put down her book, excitement taking over as to what they had come for. They neared the back of the store. Her heart sank. A gasp escaped. Not that one. Not that piece. No. Put it back. Please. <nl> She watched the two men count down and then lift the old grandfather clock from its place, each grabbing an end. They lumbered it back the way they came and stopped behind a shelf that was a few feet from where Ms. Fields sat. One of them knelt down and seemed to unzip his jacket pocket and then pull something out. He kept it concealed. He reached in again and pulled out a black rag. He pulled it over his face. She watched him on the screen about to emerge from behind the shelf. She looked up. <nl> The man's ballcap was pulled down far enough that she could barely see his eyes behind that mask. There was dust caked on his torso and abdomen. She never dusted the thing (that wasn't part of the rules), hoping browsing eyes would pass over it, perhaps not even notice it. It was so perpetually dusty that the clock looked like it was part of the store, a vital component, like the desk she sat at. She hoped customers would think it not for sale. But here were two men--likely not customers at all--that wanted the damned thing. Damned it was. <nl> "May I help you?" Ms. Fields asked. <nl> "Yes, you can. Me and my partner are going to take that old dumpy grandfather clock you keep in the back. And you're gonna let us do it. Or else." <nl> "Or else?" <nl> "Or else," the man said, raising and extending his arm. He held a pistol in his hand. He pointed it at Ms. Field's face. <nl> "That's just fine. I won't try to stop you taking whatever you want, but just so you know, everything always makes its way back soon enough." <nl> "Shut it, granny." The man stuffed the pistol back into his pocket and spun around and went back to his partner. <nl> "Three... two... one..." <nl> The pair grunted and lifted the clock, the strain of the weight perceptible in their bodily movements despite the heavy layers of clothing covering their skin. They each shot a glare at Ms. Fields as they walked past. <nl> "Take care," she said. <nl> Ms. Fields supposed if it *was* the piece's time to go, then there could be no better scenario than it being stolen. At least then it was in the hands of evil persons, rightfully so; and innocent customers would not have the opportunity to stumble upon it while it was away. <nl> That grandfather clock was evil. It was the most vile, despicable, unholy piece she owned. He himself had created it. Its spirit was black, and after it was finished swallowing these two into that blackness, it would find its way back. <nl> The thought made Ms. Fields shudder. She wished she could just be rid of the thing. But that would be breaking the rules. And when one makes a deal with the Devil, they don't break the rules. That was the price of immortality. <nl> At least she had a moment away from it. She looked back down at her novel and continued reading. <eos>

<sos> "I won't try to stop you taking whatever you want, but just so you know... everything always makes its way back soon enough," The shop owner said. A look of pity on her face. <nl> Darren raised an eyebrow, but kept the pistol aimed at her. He could hear the first wail of a siren in the distance. Was it for him? The woman hadn't moved since he'd drawn his weapon. <nl> "You might want to hurry," she said. <nl> The sirens grew louder as his grip on the pistol grew sweatier. His fingers felt hot against the metal as if he'd already fired it. His eyes darted around the store and then at the counter in front of him. <nl> He pointed down at the glass. "How much is that worth?" <nl> "It sells for fifty thousand, but to you it might as well be worthless." The woman slid open a compartment, taking her time. Her fingers found the diamond locket and pulled it from the felt display. <nl> Darren snatched it the moment it was above the counter. He let it dangle in front of him. The silver chain seemed to shine just as bright as the lights trapped inside the giant diamond. <nl> "Take it." she gestured to the door. "I won't stop you." <nl> The sirens were so loud. It sounded as if there were a squadron of police cruisers right behind him. He shoved the necklace into his pocket, a bit of chain stuck out, and then ran through the front door. On his way out he tucked the pistol in the back of his jeans. <nl> &nbsp; <nl> ** *** ** <nl> Mariah watched the people pass over her turf. She held her cup out and rattled the coins inside. A few passersby shot her dirty looks, but most  of them ignored her. She preferred anger or disgust to apathy. At least they acknowledged her existence. <nl> "Change," she called out and shook her paper cup again. She'd gotten it last week when someone had tossed his half-finished drink on her. Though it had brought her close to tears, it also had the effect of making those on the street who'd witnessed it more generous. <nl> *I should see if I could get someone to pour their drinks on me more often*, Mariah thought. <nl> Today's haul so far was three quarters, ten dimes, two nickels, and a bunch of pennies she didn't want to bother counting. There was also the wad of gum that had been dropped by a snickering teen. Mariah had been pleasantly surprised to find that it had still contained a decent amount of its mint flavor as she'd popped it into her mouth. <nl> Her eyes caught a man shuffling down the street. He kept casting nervous glances over his shoulder. As there was nothing to be gained from a man so disturbed, Mariah began to look elsewhere. <nl> Something flashy caught her eye. <nl> Sticking out of the man's pocket was a line of silver. It seemed to call out to her. She was no pickpocket--only ever tried it that one time. The idea of a repeat of her first attempt made her throat tighten up. <nl> She couldn't look away. Her tongue found its way to her lips as she slid it back and forth. <nl> When the man was close enough, she sprung forward. <nl> "Excuse me, sir." Mariah reached outwards, placing her hands on his chest. His eyes looked her up and down with an exaggerated grimace as if a rat had just jumped out of a dumpster and onto his leg. <nl> The man swung his arm into her shoulder and shoved her aside. Before she tumbled down, her hand found the length of chain. She tightened her dirty hand into a fist and pulled. <nl> She got it! <nl> Mariah hesitated for a moment as the diamond sparkled in front of her, dangling from her sticky fingers. She quickly stuffed it into her shirt. <nl> "You little..." the man's words turned guttural as he lifted her up off the sidewalk and threw her up against a storefront. "Where'd you put it?" <nl> His hands searched over her. <nl> "Help!" She shouted. "Someone please help me." Mariah tried to squirm out of his grasp as a hand traveled up her chest. <nl> The left side of her face exploded with pain. She hadn't even seen his fist coming. She was barely aware of the ground rising up as she fell. Somewhere nearby a woman was shouting, "Someone stop him! He's beating her!" <nl> Feet stomped and scratched the concrete around her. When Mariah looked up she saw the a crowd of men pushing her attacker back. The man's hands were still reaching for her. His eyes wild and bulding. Her cheek felt wet and warm. <nl> Mariah sat up and felt along her face. Her fingers came back bloody. She thought of the necklace and the world snapped back into focus with startling clarity. She still had it. She could feel the cold metal against her skin. <nl> &nbsp; <nl> ---- <nl> Seymor waited in the alley. This was not his home, but he could count on the occasional meal here. Sometimes the woman spared a scrap for him. More often than not all she had was a scratch behind the ear and some kind words. It was more than he was used to. <nl> His paws padded against the shadowed concrete as he relieved himself against a dumpster. The smells that wafted from it and containers like this drove him mad with desire. <nl> A noise brought his attention away from the delicious aromas of the trash. <nl> The nice woman stumbled into the view between the two buildings at the edge of the alley. She didn't even see him as he waggled his tail and spun around a few times as she usually liked. No, her attention was on something else. Something shiny. <nl> She plopped herself down on her old mattress and stared at her hands. No, she stared at the shiny thing in her hands. As was he. <nl> "How much are you worth?" She asked. <nl> Seymor raised his ears. He was pretty sure people usually talked to each other, not things. He edged closer to the nice woman. His body tensed as he felt the need for caution. <nl> "Sorry, boy. No food today," she said without looking at him. Her voice sounded rough, almost angry. <nl> If he understood anything beyond the word 'food', it wouldn't have mattered. Seeing the shiny thing up close made his mouth water and tail shake more than the scents from the dumpster. <nl> "Why're you looking at me like that?" The woman asked. "Go on. Get!" <nl> She swatted at him, but he leapt back just in time. Seymor moved closer. When she swatted again, he took his chance. He ducked under her arm and closed his jaws around the shiny and darted away. The taste of metal and sweat filled his mouth. He had the shiny toy! <nl> He felt her fingers grasping, digging into his fur. Years on the streets, only bathing when there was a heavy downpour, his hair was greasy and hard to grab hold of. Seymor slipped right out. <nl> &nbsp; <nl> ---- <nl> Prey. Far above the city's rooftops, she searched for prey. The wind blew through her feathers as she glided, her wings outstretched, hugging the air. <nl> The people sometimes dropped food, but nothing was as good a juicy mouse or... <nl> A sparkle on the ground caught her eye. She saw it bounce up and down as it was carried down a lonesome road. She swooped down for a closer look. <nl> Her shadow fell over the dogs back. She'd caught a closer glimpse of the dangling necklace. Oh how it sparkled. How it shone! Thoughts of prey turned to how she might decorate her nest. Though she'd built it years ago, she always had kept an eye out for things that caught the light. <nl> The dog looked up as she passed a second time. It growled, baring its cruel teeth up at her. She rose to the sky. The cool air up this high filled her lungs and made her feel invincible. The only though in her mind: shiny. <nl> This last dive was almost vertical. Her body whistled through the air. At the last second, the dog reared up on his hind legs and clawed at her. He made the mistake of snapping his jaws, trying to catch her neck. <nl> Through the dog's spittle and ruffle of feathers from his swinging paws, she managed to close her beak over the chain. The shiny. <nl> The dog raged below as she tore back to the sky with thoughts of where in her nest she'd place it. <nl> &nbsp; <nl> ---- <nl> Samantha stepped outside and gazed into a near empty parking lot. Her store in this strip mall wasn't the last to close, but business usually tapered off quickly after seven. <nl> She heard the high pitched squeals and excited squawks from up high. <nl> *So soon?* She smiled. <nl> Back inside the store, Samantha moved behind the counter and pulled out a cardboard box. From it she snatched a roll of aluminum foil and tore off a small square. As she made her way back out the store, she crinkled it up into a small ball. <nl> Behind her building she climbed the ladder to the roof. From here she could see the setting sun in the west. Just enough light left in the day for one last transaction. <nl> The hawk watched her approach. It moved a wing to cover the diamond necklace it had started to embed in the fibers of its nest. <nl> "Mindy," Samantha said as she waggled the balled up aluminum foil. "Thank you for finding my necklace." <nl> The bird flapped its wings and screamed something only its kind understood. It moved its body over its treasure, guarding it. <nl> "Mindy." Her voice grew stern. She pulled out a flashlight and tossed the aluminum ball across the roof. Samantha watched as the hawk eyed the shiny metal foil skip across. <nl> When the light from the flashlight danced along the dozens of edges and creases of the foil, the hawk began to lurch out of its nest. <nl> "That's right, Mindy." Samantha inched over to the nest. "It's all yours. More shiny for your nest." <nl> Keeping her light on the foil, Samantha yanked the necklace out of the nest and back away. The bird would forget once it was out of sight and her new shiny was in her nest. She always did. <nl> Samantha walked back into her store and replaced the necklace. She breathed a sigh of relief and left her shop. <nl> Shiny things were the easiest to get back. Samantha was still waiting for the antique lamp to find its way back to her. As she started her car, she wondered where it was at this moment. What pair of hands had it passed over to today? It didn't matter. <nl> "Everything always makes its way back soon enough..." She smiled as she gave one last look at the shop and then drove off. <nl> &nbsp; <nl> ---- <nl> /r/StevenLee <eos>

<sos> I don't know what got into me. I've never snapped like that before but those unintelligent bastards roaming the town were too stupid for their own good.  Yes, I've lived this several quite a few times but still, they should have learned something by now, isn't that how evolution works.  Though I panicked a bit at first, what's the worst that could happen, I wake up tomorrow and the bastards are still roaming. Great now I get to kill them all again, it can be my own little game and each day I can get better at the task than the day before.   Woah what the fuck, how did that thought just go through my mind. I don't know how I ever killed those people in the first place and now I'm planning how to do it all over again.  I guess being stuck on July 7th over and over again has really gotten to me.  Yeah it was cool at first having all that extra time to perfect any talent I want. Now that I have perfected it all though, it is like there is no intelligent life form to hang out with, I don't know how these people even survived this long with their limited intelligence. <nl> Whatever I'm just in a mood, I guess. I'll just sleep it off and think of a more civil game to play tomorrow.  I had my dream last night, you know the one that has been happening to every single night for the past 7,777 days. The one where an something abducts me and places me in Waluki, telling me that I deserve to have the best birthday ever and that these new people can help me achieve it.  Though, today instead of wishing me a happy birthday, the voice said "Congratulations, you did it," and then I woke up. Except unlike every other day where I walk down the stairs and there is a birthday celebration with all my "closest friends," I walk downstairs and see the bodies right where I left them last night. <nl> Fuck, what does this mean, why didn't my day reset like every other day. Whatever, now I don't have to deal with all those idiots, who for the record are the worst party planners ever. Seriously a clown, what am I five? I mean to them yes, but I have been living today for 21 years, I don't want a fucking clown.   I decide to use today to have the actual best day ever. I sat naked in the hot tub watching movies all day long with a five gallon bucket of pizza rolls next to me.  Wow, I could live this day for 21 more years. I thought of how great this is, no one will ever catch me. First no one ever goes to Waluki so it will take forever for anyone to even realize anything is wrong. When they do realize, who would ever think that this cute little child could ever kill 2,831 people with her bare hands. <nl> Slowly, I drift asleep in the hot tub and the dream begins except just like yesterday, I am once again congratulated. I open my eyes and and I am floating in the hot tub, pizza rolls everywhere. It's officially two days out of the loop, this is amazing. I have the whole town to myself and can do whatever I want.  I continue living my best life, chugging down light beer, eating pizza, and wandering town for any fun activities. Some days it is playing with a victims video games or playing dress up in an old woman's house but every day is different and each is a new "best day." <nl> About a month in, I am finally getting rid of freezers to raid and the alcohol has run dry.  The best day ever is turning into a nightmare.  I'm sitting in the quid's house making a stained glass window when a cute Spanish boy walks into the house. Naive me assumed it was a normal boy, man was I wrong.  Helro was just like me, he also lived his fifth birthday for 21 years and wiped his towns population from existence.  Helro has been out of the loop for three years though, he says that it is his job to collect the others. <nl> He takes me to his new town, there are about 300 other five year olds there. They are playing chess, having political debates, doing scientific research and of course eating pizza rolls.  This new town is breathtaking, finally somewhere where I can be who I truly deserve, an adult.  Helro says there are thousands of children still in the loop and when they all get out the next phase will begin, until then unlimited booze and junk food. <eos>

<sos> I lean back into the chair, as I looked at the man in front of me. "Could you at least untie the rope?" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> He looked up from his bowl of noodles as he glances around, and then back towards me. "The boss said I wasn't supposed to interact with you-" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "Yes, yes because I am valuable as I'm the only person in this whole world that can be a victim," I spoke with a roll of my eyes and then looked down at the noodles. "Are you suppose to be eating on the job?!" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "Well, This is considered an easy job..." He sucked a mouthful of noodles, before handing the bowl to me. "Want some?" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> I just stared at him and looked down at the ropes. "Will you untie me?" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "No." When he saw the confusion. "It'd be like feeding it little baby, here comes the airplane!" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> Before he got to bring the fork to my mouth, the sound of glass breaking filled the room. "Unhand her, you swine!" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> A man standing in spandex, doing the famous superhero chest pose stood there. "In the name of justice, I demand that you release her, or become a victim of my wrath!" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> I went to take a bite as I slurred the noodles. "He's going to win-" And then the fork and bowl dropped on my lap as I released a yelp at the hot water, and the two began to fight. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> After a few minutes, the hero came over, untied me, and we left. When he dropped to the 'safe' location, the news reporters were already there as they held the cameras up, took pictures and shouted questions. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "Were you terrified?!" One asked. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "No..." <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "Were you harmed?!" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "Well, I had hot water spilled on me but I'm pretty sure it was an acc-" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "This just in, the victim was tortured by scolding hot water and if it wasn't for her savior surely this young woman would have been scarred for life!" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "....That's not what happened!" I shouted behind the news reporter, who held up her hand as suddenly my voice was silenced. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "We also believe that she may have Stockholms, and unable to speak due to her experience! We'll cover more on this story tonight at 8!" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> After that, everyone focused on the hero and I was able to slip away as I attempted to dip, duck, dodge, and sneak into my apartment. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> As I stepped through the door, I tripped on some wire and whacked head first onto the floor. "God damn it!" I exclaimed before I heard. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "Mahahaha! Prepare to meet your doo-" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "No! No! No!" I pointed to the clock. "It is 6 o'clock, I have already had one kidnapping, had hot water spilled on me, and dealt with the news. We have rules, no more after 6-" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "You don't make the rules!" Then the man paused. "Alright, so I'll be back tomorrow, say 10?" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "In the morning?!" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "Yes, or would noon be better?" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "Get. Out!" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> With that, the man vanished leaving me alone as I walked into my bathroom to take a shower, changed into my PJs, and then moved to sit on the couch to relax. "Might as well watch powertube," I muttered as I grabbed my laptop to help with the relaxing. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> After an hour of watching music videos, and how-to videos there was a suggestion on the corner of the page. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> \*Conspiracy theory: Did Ms. Wonder actually fake her powers?\* <nl> &#x200B; <nl> Curiousity started to fill me as I clicked the video and watched as it talked about how a woman made the public thing she had a wide range of powers and ability, but in reality all she could do was make things clean and spotless...but she used illusions to fake making it look like she could make things disappear, and float in the air...even walk on water. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> This created a search of old videos and old websites where people talked about 'magic tricks', making cards disappear, and reappear. Due to the how old these things were, and how outdated it was I wondered if people still had the knowledge of these things, as I started reading everything. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> As soon as the sun came out, I left for the store. I made sure to wear something that would hide who I was, as I went through the isles. A deck of cards, a package of foam cups, a bottle of water since I was thirsty anyway, a bag of rubber bands and a key ring, a package of toothpicks, and a roll of clear tape. After buying everything, I went back to my apartment walking by the guy from last night as I made sure to hide the content in my bag. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "Prepare to meet-" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "Sorry! Already got kidnapped, just getting back...you know the rules. One kidnapping per day, but tomorrow! Promise!" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> The look of defeat was clear as he huffed. "Fine!" He called out, and vanished again as I stepped into the apartment and started to practice my new 'abilities'. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> It took hours before I was able to get everything correctly, but pretty soon after reading, studying, and practicing. I was able to make the foam cup lift up, rotate the plastic straw without touching it, making toothpick disappears, and even bending spoons with only looking at them. I scream with excitement as I now had to activate the plan. First thing, go to sleep, get kidnapped, get saved, and get caught on camera using my new 'abilities'. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> After going to bed, I woke up, brushed my teeth, took a shower and prepared to go to the 'gym' with my 'gym' bag that was filled with all of my new abilities. As I stepped out of my door, I tripped on that wire again. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "Ow! God damn it!" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "Prepare yourself for the-" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "Come on, let's get this over with!" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> I cut him off, as I moved over. "C' mon, I'm busy today, let's get this on the road." <nl> &#x200B; <nl> He stared at me as he huffed. "This is not how it works!" Before he proceeded the kidnapping and we went to his 'hidden' location. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> The usual happened, big speeches, getting tied up, waiting for the hero and that's when my excitement began to fill as the hero picked me and my bag up and delivered me to a location in front of the news reporters. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> As the news reporter began chattering with each other, I took a few minutes to prepare to make it look like I was just making sure I had everything. Afterward, I 'casually' began to make that foam cup float between my fingers and heard the reporters around me gasp, and grow quiet. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "Ma'am! Isn't it true that you don't have abilities?" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> I glanced up casually and then looked down at the cup. "Oh...I didn't even realize-" That's when I began to do my next trick as I took out my bottle of water and straw, after a few moments I moved my fingers and the straw began to spin around in the circle and I gasped. "What's happening?!" I asked the hero who was staring at me as if he was compuzzled on this situation. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "....I believe you have superpowers after all..." <nl> &#x200B; <nl> As those words came out of his mouth, I watched as one of the reporters did a circular motion with her hands. "Alright, well it seems like we wasted our time here!" She called to her crew, and then just like that the crowd started to disappear. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> As news started to spread, my walk home actually became uneventful as I was stopped and showed my disappearing toothpick ability and it caused people to just leave... it wasn't until I got home and sat down did I realize after years of kidnappings, savings, news reporters, and issues left and right, I was now considered 'normal and boring' and I was loving every moment of it. <eos>

<sos> "How much you going in with?" Zap asked, as he clenched and unclenched his hands, making sure the feedback relays synced with the haptics in his gloves. "Gotta be a mint. You were so far up the proctor's ass we thought you were trying to get an A level in proctology." <nl> Jane jumped lightly up and down beside her neighboring pod, ignoring Zap for the moment. Her HUD was only showing an 83% registry on her feet, causing them to feel slightly numb and disconnected from the rest of her body. She wished she had the glitz to upgrade the suit, but that wasn't happening unless she landed a corp scholarship. She reached down, the skintight carbon black material of the suit stretching across her athletic legs. After a few tugs and smacks, the number nudged up to 96%. She wasn't going to do better than that. Not with v2. She was lucky enough to get that as it was. <nl> Finally, she turned toward Zap. "You got your bank, I got mine. You keep your eyes on yours, I'll worry about mine." Jane didn't blame him for fishing, everyone wanted a peek at her balance. They knew enough to know she had built up an edge, though most didn't know how much. <nl> More than they thought. <nl> The Centurion was all that stood between her and a future worth living. She'd been prepping for four years, and now was her time to prove it had all been worth it. <nl> Proctor Vertia came to stand in the rostrum in the center of the podroom. A hundred haptic pods encircled the raised platform, in three neat rows. The proctor cleared her throat, taking a moment to slowly turn around and survey the class she had overseen for the last four years. "As you know, today we begin the Centurion. You are the select few who have qualified for the honor of taking this test, and your performance will have dramatic effects on the course of your life." <nl> The last three presidents had each been winners of their Centurion, and most of the Fortune 500 companies staffed their executive teams with top performers. Qualifying for the Centurion was a golden ticket, the only question was where it would take you. <nl> Jane had plans. <nl> "The contest is quite simple. Each of you will be transported into Ancient Rome. The year is 44 BC, and Dictator Julius Caesar lies dead on the Senate floor, slain by the hands of the senators, friend and foes alike." A small murmur spreads through the class. It had been some time since the Downfall Scenario had been selected, and more than a few found themselves flatfooted without the requisite preparation. Jane could only smile, her pearly whites shining in the dim lighting of the podroom. She had just refreshed the Downfall Scenario the week prior, and much of the status of Rome remained in her head. <nl> Proctor Vertia raised her hands, only continuing once the whispers died down. "Scoring will be determined by impact upon the Republic. While there is no expectation that the the fall into tyranny will be reversed, students that effectuate a positive change in historic circumstance will be well-positioned to succeed. Each of you have acquired a bank to assist you in this task. It may be used in any way you see fit within the context of the simulation, including used to purchase status and position prior to the commencement of the simulation." <nl> She turned slowly in a circle again, "I wish each of you the best of luck. Once the Centurion is begun, the hundred-day timer will commence and any who remove their mask will be immediately disqualified." Jane grimaced, whether from the image of removing her mask and accepting failure or thinking about spending a 100 days in the haptic suit, she couldn't say. <nl> "Are there any questions?" The proctor asked. <nl> None raised their hand. <nl> "Good, I'm not permitted to answer them anyway." A grin now from the proctor, accompanied by polite laughter from a smattering of the students. "Very well, please place the masks on, submerge and engage program." <nl> Jane pulled the mask over her head. A large timer appeared on the HUD, reading *Centurion Start: 59:59.32.* Jane scrambled into the haptic tank and slowly slid into the viscous fluid. Her breaths began to increase, powered by the heady mix of excitement and fear. Finally, the time had come. <nl> Her hands twitched as she began to navigate the Preparation Menus. She glanced at her bank. 3721 gold. An enormous amount. Enough to buy a villa. Enough to start as an upper dignitary. <nl> Jane grinned beneath her mask.  Enough to raise an army. <nl> Maybe, just maybe, enough to save the Republic. <nl> Yes, Jane had plans. <nl> **Okay okay, I'll write a part two on my sub when I get home after work.** <nl> **Platypus OUT.** <nl> **Want MOAR peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus <eos>

<sos> Koi breathed into her hands. The nights got cold this far north. Soon the Hive would have to move south, for winter was close at hand. <nl> "How much longer?" asked Jalen through the dark. The tall fields of wild grass made it difficult to pick out his position, even under the full moon. <nl> "Not long," said Koi. "Our relief should be here soon." <nl> "No gains tonight," replied Jalen sourly. Koi knew how he felt. <nl> The goal of all Hive patrollers, of course, was to find Strays. A good mind would strengthen them all, and their mass was already the mightiest for a hundred miles in any direction. And if the Stray's mind wasn't strong -- well, at best they were bait, at worst, dinner. <nl> But Koi and Jalen weren't a part of their Hive, not really. They stayed because they had to. To wander off without a large group meant lameness, dimness, and usually death -- if not by wild animals, than at the hands of a violent Hive. A Hive like theirs. <nl> That's why Jalen was disappointed. Their group, the Fringers, were close to having enough members to splinter off. They would be chased, of course, and outwitting such a powerful Hive was a long shot, but anything was better than the forced violence and cruelty of their group. It was a risk their twenty or so members were willing to take -- just as soon as they gained a few more members. <nl> Behind her, still distant, Koi thought she could hear the rustling of footsteps. Their relief would be here soon. Her mind turned to dinner, about her ration of whi-- <nl> "Yah!" mumbled Jalen nearby as he crashed to the ground. "What the hell..." <nl> Koi saw the tall grass sway where Jalen had fallen. She rushed over and found him -- on top of a small girl. <nl> Immediately Koi slapped her hand on Jalen's mouth. The rustling of their relief was close now. A girl so small couldn't possibly be a mind worthy of the Hive. Her fate was sealed if she was discovered by anyone other than themselves. <nl> The girl -- frail, with huge eyes that glimmered brown in the moonlight -- looked terrified. Koi put a finger over her mouth and smiled. Whether from weakness or fear, the girl stayed silent. <nl> "Where the hell are those two?" came a gruff voice. <nl> "Who knows," said a second. "I told you the other night, I don't trust them." <nl> "I think they're up to something, along with a few others on patrol." <nl> "We'll have to let the boss know after our shift. C'mon, let's get going." <nl> The two new patrollers passed frighteningly close to Koi, Jalen, and the girl's hiding spot. Koi rested a hand on the girl's shoulder, reassuring her as the patrollers steadily moved away. <nl> But before anything else could be said, Koi felt a tingling in her hand. Looking down, she saw that the girl's eyes had flashed pitch black. Suddenly Koi felt alight with energy. Her vision improved, letting her see straight through the night. She could hear distant chirping, feel every bristle of the grass, smell scents miles off. <nl> *Impossible*, Koi thought. No one had found a Neuro in the wild for decades. They were a legend, a half-forgotten myth. But there was no other explanation. <nl> "What's wrong?" asked Jalen softly. <nl> Koi, half excited, half terrified, replied, "Gather the Fringers. We leave tonight." <nl> \-------------------- <nl> 424/365 <nl> one story per day for a year (and counting) read them all at [r/babyshoesalesman](https://www.reddit.com/r/babyshoesalesman) <nl> \-------------------- <eos>

<sos> Carol had won the envy of the entire base by receiving the job of cleaning the Suit between uses. She would proudly enter the bunker with her soft cloths and polish, and tenderly buff away every scuff of dirt that marred the paint. Every single time, she held her breath with the anxiety that the Suit had been scratched, and she was relieved when her love revealed that it had magically held its integrity through every bombardment. No one knew where it had come from, but it had become the pride and joy of the military, and she was its sacred Keeper. She often joked that the Suit took up so much of her time and attention, she didn't have any affection left to share with another human being. <nl> The master sergeant was considered to be the best pilot, which earned him more missions in the Suit than anyone else. However, unbeknownst to any of the higher ups, the cumulative effect was beginning to degrade his psychological resilience, and he was growing resentful of anyone else who touched what he was increasingly beginning to consider his own. Every time he donned the Suit, he thought about defying commands and never returning to base, certain that no one would be able to stop him if he turned renegade. Only the uncertainty of running from the military with no objective to follow kept him obedient, and his ache was a dark secret. <nl> Brooding, he hung around to watch Carol work on his beloved Suit, and his heart stung with jealousy when he saw how tenderly she touched the metal. When she opened it up to wipe down the leather interior, he couldn't stand it anymore; it was worse than walking in on a spouse in the thralls of another lover. He clapped his hand on her shoulder, roughly squeezed down, and growled, "You ever worn it?" <nl> "No." Carol winced and looked away, not daring to try to free herself. Something in his eyes didn't look right, and she decided that it would be best to slip away as quick as she could before reporting him. <nl> He lowered his mouth down next to her ear, and whispered with his lips brushing her skin, "Try it." <nl> "I'm not authorized," she replied, tilting her head away. She scanned the bunker for anyone else to call out to, but it was lunchtime and the place was empty. <nl> "Do you mean to tell me that you can repeatedly strip the Suit bare, and not feel the impulse to climb inside? Go on and try it, I won't tattle." His other hand seized her upper arm, his fingertips digging in deeply enough to leave bruises. He pushed her forward, banging her head against the interior. <nl> "Here, I'll even tell you what to expect," he said, turning her around and holding her in position with his forearm, as he kicked her legs to get her to step inside. "Don't worry when you hear the words, 'User unknown: booting safe mode', because it does that for everyone. Then it will squeeze tight for a moment before it releases like a breath of air, and you'll feel like you aren't wearing anything at all. Operating it is intuitive, so you'll get the hang of it." <nl> He had completely lost his mind, Carol thought as she met his eyes. She was certain that he wouldn't actually try to close her inside the Suit, knowing that it would give her the ability to turn him into a smoldering crater in a heartbeat. He was likely trying to get her fired, and that she couldn't allow under any circumstance. <nl> "Let me go," she ordered, hoping that her voice sounded strong and commanding. "I'm not authorized to use the Suit, and I will report you for misconduct." <nl> "You think I care?" The master sergeant grabbed Carol's chin and glared into her eyes. "You'll have a fatal accident long before you report anything to anyone." <nl> The look of sheer malevolence on his face caused her to panic, and before she knew it she had hit the button to close the Suit. The master sergeant abruptly pulled his hand back with a cuss, and through the visor Carol could see that his wrist had been cut deeply, nearly severing his hand. She stayed very still, shocked and scared, wondering what she should do to get herself out of the metaphorical fire she had just jumped into. Then the interior of the Suit sprang alive with lights and a breeze of circulated air, as a computer voice spoke, <nl> "**User detected: welcome back, Commander."** <nl> Carol's heart stopped. <nl> Now she was really in trouble. <nl> \*\*\* <nl> [Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/csi5z1/wpthe_suit_is_powerfull_a_mech_for_some_body/exg3jbc/?context=3) <nl> [Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/csi5z1/wpthe_suit_is_powerfull_a_mech_for_some_body/exi7p43/?context=3) <nl> [Four](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/csi5z1/wpthe_suit_is_powerfull_a_mech_for_some_body/exsch6y/?context=3) <nl> [Five](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/csi5z1/wpthe_suit_is_powerfull_a_mech_for_some_body/ey78mdi/?context=3) <nl> [Six](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/csi5z1/wpthe_suit_is_powerfull_a_mech_for_some_body/ey78oe3/?context=3) <nl> [Seven A](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/csi5z1/wpthe_suit_is_powerfull_a_mech_for_some_body/eyadjgo/?context=3) <nl> [Seven B](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/csi5z1/wpthe_suit_is_powerfull_a_mech_for_some_body/eyadnhr/?context=3) <nl> The rest will not be posted on Reddit.

<sos> "Defenses breached!" A loudspeaker broadcasted in a voice that boomed in Alice's ears. "All units report to Zone Three!" <nl> Alice looked up from her tattered paperback--one of the few that had been brought over from Earth--and out the window. The only sun she'd known, a red dwarf, was melting into the eastern horizon. <nl> "All units," The voice on the loudspeaker sounded desperate. "Every who can carry a weapon... report to Zone Three immediately!" <nl> Sirens began to pierce the air. Alice's stomach turned as she tossed the book aside, leapt off the bed, and dashed to her footlocker. She grabbed her weapon, a first generation plasma rifle that had been handed down through her family. Originally owned by her grandfather, Aaron Adams--hero of the first colonists--the rifle almost seemed to hum as she held it, cradled it. For years she'd dreamt of the day it would be in her arms, and now it was, a gift from her mother on her last birthday. "You're eighteen now and old enough to fight," her mother had said. "Make us proud." <nl> She rushed out of her empty side of the barracks and into the late evening. The sounds of battle were far and muted to distant pings and pops like a low powered transmitter on the fritz. Alice ran toward the sound. Her boots scratched against the hard blue grass. Each step her heart seemed to pump too little, too late, the rifle in her arms grew heavier and heavier. <nl> Alice had turned out to be the worst shot in her unit. It wouldn't have been so bad if she hadn't had to constantly stand in her grandfather's shadow, but she was, and all of them had expected much more from the granddaughter of Aaron Adams. <nl> As she ran toward the chaos, her stomach churned, not so much at the thought of the enemy, but of the faces of her comrades when she joined the fray. They would be disappointed. She could almost hear their taunts--*we're doomed if Alice is our only help, she couldn't hit the side of a fabrication hab, so much for the Adam's legacy.* <nl> In defiance, she pushed herself harder. It was what her grandfather had always done. First to battle, first to victory. It had been his motto. <nl> "Private Adams!" Sergeant Brown's voice roared across the field. She stumbled, turned, and sprinted toward him. "Where the hell is your armor?" <nl> "The call said to come immediately," Alice panted. She'd also been the last to finish each of the daily runs. Her lungs seemed to either require more oxygen or couldn't get enough quickly, either way, Alice always felt on the verge of passing out after a few minutes. <nl> "Christ on a..." Sergeant Brown shook his head. "At least you grabbed your rifle. There might be hope for you yet." <nl> "Next time I'll put on my armor before leaving," Alice said standing as straight as she could. "Permission to join the battle, sir?" <nl> "Hold on, hold on." The Sergeant held up a hand as he fished something out of the back of his field vehicle. "Here, throw this on." <nl> He tossed an old flak jacket that had dozens of burns and large tears from decades of use. It looked like it wouldn't hold up to harsh language, let alone a shot from the enemy, but it was all she had. <nl> As she slipped her arms through, the Sergeant chuckled, "I think that had actually been Aaron's. Now that I think about it, I'm sure it was." <nl> "Really?" Her eyes went wide as she snapped the bindings together down her side. <nl> "Pretty sure. But it looks as if it's seen better days. Guess there's no truth to the rumors about his 'special armor.' Don't go get yourself killed, kid." When she'd finished putting the jacked on, Sergeant Brown shouted, "Now get going, private!" <nl> Alice raced to the battlefield. She watched as her fellow soldiers took up defensive positions behind concrete bunkers and rows of sandbags. In front, what used to the be the eastern wall was now a smoking ruin. Hundreds of Traxan flyers buzzed through. Alice aimed at one of them and fired a bolt of green plasma. The flying Traxan dodged it easily, swinging through the air, its short wings flapping madly as it rained shots down on Alice's people. <nl> Before she reached her unit, a voice called out to her, "User Detected: Welcome back Commander!" <nl> She almost tripped over her own feet as she searched for the source of the voice. "Reconfiguring to last preset." <nl> "Who's there?" Alice spun around. Heat flooded to her face. The battle raged on in front of her and someone was playing games with her. "Stop it!" she shouted. <nl> Before she could move any further, the flak jacket ballooned out in front of her as if about to explode. Alice cringed and dropped her rifle. She almost fell backwards, but at that moment a wall of metal engulfed her. Everything went black.. <nl> A second later she was staring out the visor of some kind of helmet. When she brought her hands up to her face, they were covered in silver armor, streaked with green paint. There were words at the top right of her visor: *Jets Active, Shield 100%, Aim-Assist Active.* <nl> Not knowing what to make of this, Alice scooped up her rifle and ran into the carnage. <nl> Shots from the Traxans clunked off of her armor. The number next to her shield went down with each hit, but she hardly felt them. Alice raised her rifle up to the sky, toward a group of flying Traxans and squeezed off three shots. Each one blew holes through the Traxan's midsections. Blood and guts and green plasma blasted outward like a horrific Christmas display. <nl> Alice winced as their bodies lost their forward momentum and crashed down to the dirt. She'd never killed anything before. No, she couldn't think about that now. They were attacking her people. If she had any qualms about Traxan deaths, she'd find out later. Not now. <nl> She found her unit. They were trapped inside a concrete pillbox, huddling under the lip of the barrier as they fired blind shots at the enemy. <nl> Alice began to run over. She gritted her teeth, wishing she could go faster. No sooner had she thought it when her feet lifted from the ground. A sound like a jet taking off blasted from behind her. Her feet dangled behind as Alice flew forward like a rocket, toward her unit. She came to a stop directly above them. <nl> From up so high, she had a great view of the battle. She spotted the Traxan flanking maneuver, moving toward her unit's position. She cut it off by blowing a hole through the two Traxan Grounders. The rest scattered for cover. <nl> "Push forward!" Alice shouted. <nl> She didn't wait for a response. Her body soared forward. From the sky she was able to pick off advancing Traxan Grounders and smash into their Flyers. Her armor hit them like a train crashing into a stationary cow. <nl> Alice moved from one side of the battlefield to the other, routing the enemy and sending them scurrying back over the wall they'd blown apart. When she finally landed back on the ground, her armor was nearly black from the dried blood and dirt and debris from fighting. <nl> "Threat Neutralized," the phantom voice said. "Powering down." <nl> The suit vanished and Alice found herself wearing the flak jacket from before. Her finger traced the rigid fabric around one of the large burn marks. *What is this thing*, she wondered. There was a legend of how her grandfather had been aided by a full suit of flak armor that had kept him alive through impossible situations, but this was different. Where had this suit come fr-- <nl> "Traxan forces regrouping!" A voice rose behind her. "They're bringing in their heavy armor." <nl> Alice caught a bare glimpse of the wall before the suit reemerged. <nl> "Systems back online..." <nl> &nbsp; <nl> ------- <nl> /r/StevenLee <nl> edit: thanks for the silver, and second part down below. <eos>

<sos> "I'm just a kid! I shouldn't have a job!" <nl> The demon dragged her along the corridor, still clutching her hand as it had been since the contract was shaken into existence. "Back in my day, every kid had a job!" the demon rasped. "Shinin' shoes, polishing guns, getting the chimney fit for Santa." <nl> The girl's eyes widened, merging her freckles into one big brown stain. "Santa's real? I knew it! I knew it!" Just wait until her brother heard this. That idiot wouldn't be laughing at her, then. <nl> "Did I say Santa?" The demon, who was no more than a solid swirl of shadows, pushed a new arm out of his body. He took the cigar from his mouth and embers fell like shooting stars against him. "I meant to say *Satan*." He laughed as they walked. <nl> Taylor wanted to go home. Her tamagotchi would need feeding soon, and if she didn't keep this one alive, there was no way Daddy would let her get a cat. Of all the nights to let a demon-under-the-bed shake your hand! She bit her lip, furious with herself for leaving an arm dangling. Mike, her older brother, had told her that a monster would get her leg or arm or whatever it was that wasn't safely tucked in. And now, worse than having to work in Hell: her brother was right. He'd never let her forget! <nl> The corridor was bright white and reminded her of eggshells and hospitals. Not exactly how she thought Hell would be. They passed arched doors, left and right, from beneath which muted screams and laughter crept out. <nl> "What's happening in there?" she asked, as they passed a particularly screamsome room. <nl> "Ah, that's just the prod-a-tron-2020 testin' space." <nl> She frowned. "Prod-a-tron?" <nl> "*Prod-a-tron.* Prod. A. Tron." <nl> She frowned deeper. <nl> "Jeez, kid. You never heard of a prod-a-tron?" He took another puff of his cigar, blowing smoke into her face. "Satan developed it a long time ago, back when he was a little more, uh, *creative*. Someone cycles a bike powering the device, someone else -- the victim -- is tied to a pole and gets prodded by sharpened bones and tickled by feathers. Ehh, not too sharp though," he added. "It's not about killing. Just about discomfort. That's the secret to good torture." <nl> Taylor hated being prodded by her bother. Especially in the car. She nodded. <nl> "And this, the 2020 edition, it's an upgrade. Uses solar power, you see, so we don't need to worry about wasting demons on it. Which is good, seeing as they're hard to come by these days -- that's why we're recruiting outside the box. And it prods at twice the speed, too." He lowered his voice. "Between you and me: *not His greatest invention*." <nl> "It would be worse if you were spinning," Taylor said. Car journeys. Or rides at the amusement. That's when Mike knew to strike, because that's when Taylor would be feeling like throwing up her lunch. And a well placed prod would bring it all hurtling. <nl> "Huh?" <nl> "If they were spinning. Then they'd feel sick and dizzy, and the prodding would make them feel even worse. It would be the very last thing they'd want in the entire world." <nl> The dark demon stopped. Little yellow eyes flickered all over his body, roaming nebula, as he thought. "Say, that's a pretty good idea. It would be way worse. And it wouldn't take much more power to get the victim spinning." <nl> "What's my job, anyway?" <nl> "Huh?" <nl> "Well, you said I was hired, but you never said what my job was," Taylor explained. "So, what is it?" <nl> "Oh. You're a Tester. Like the guy getting prod-a-tronned. You make sure all the latest ideas He and the Inventors have, work. Simple job." <nl> Her eyes became bleary-misery. <nl> "But... I don't know," he added. "Maybe if you got another idea like that one you just had... Maybe I could put in a word for you. We need some more innovation down here, I reckon. The world up there is going to Hell without our help. We got to move forward. Progress." <nl> "Idea like what?" <nl> "A mean idea. Like the prod-and-spin. Say, that's a good name! Prod-and-spin. Or prod-and-whirl?" <nl> She considered. Remembered the time Mike put her hand in warm water as she slept. The time he swapped the sugar with the salt. The hundred other pranks that made her life a misery. "I've got a lot of ideas," she said. "And uh... If you do need a new Tester... I know someone who would *love* to help you." <eos>

<sos> If it had been an easier task, they would have handled it themselves. But no, it had been a dirty job, so they had called upon me. <nl> They call me Randoh. Once, I had a name. I had a family, once. I can sometimes remember the farm. The peace, sometimes. But then the Greenskins attacked. They came in the night, slaughtered our livestock, took my family and left me for dead. That was their mistake. <nl> The ditch-digger had me half buried before I woke up. He thought I might be some unholy dead thing. Maybe I am dead. Maybe I died that burning night. Maybe, for a time, I became death. <nl> I tracked the Greenskins that attacked my home back to their tribe. My boyhood pursuits had taught me squirrels are much harder to follow. I watched them. I waited. I took my vengeance on the Greenskins one by one in that dark, stinking forest. I buried what was left of my family, my life, and walked away. <nl> They call me Randoh. <nl> I take the dirty jobs no one else is desperate, or stupid enough to take. They call on me when anyone else who might have is dead or pissing themselves on a corner. The fiend of Gizerald, the Lizardking of Tamash, the troll tribe of Backshe... they tried to give me a knighthood for that one. <nl> Fuck 'em I said. Who needs a title when you don't even have a name? <nl> It took them time to find me, but they caught up when I visited town. Covered in Greenskin blood and ichor, I must have looked more beast than man, turning in the ears I had collected on my most recent raid against the hordes. A Dragon, they said. Only a fool, they said. Or a man with a death-wish would face it. <nl> I didn't care about The Dragon Empire, or the unsteady peace, or that war was about to break out. I had been War for years. I took the job. <nl> I travelled to Fort Krox and walked into that smoking castle where the kingdom kept its treasury safe under guard. And I fought. <nl> I found an adversary as keen and focused as i had ever been; a match for my determination and will if ever there was one. The battle raged for days, as gouts of flame, dragon roars, toppling towers attested to. The battle ended one dark night when a metallic shriek and storm of wings announced the dragons retreat. <nl> They offered me gold, they offered me riches. I refused and left, for I had taken a greater wound than any of them could know. Deep in the darkness of the castle I had faced that dragon. It had used its wits, its magic to draw my words from me, to make me confront my own past. And in the end, it had used beauty to break that terrible hold that Death had upon me. But the sword that had wounded me had not been one-sided. <nl> The Dragon Empire, at the request of the Greenskin tribes, had sent their best against me, a princess of their kind. But she never returned home to her people. <nl> Months later the letter caught up to me, a missive delivered by the King's own Herald. I had looked to my wife with her brilliant fire-red hair nursing our newborn daughter. Her bright eyes, ever challenging, met mine as I read the message aloud, followed by an "Ooops." <nl> "So, what are you going to do... -Sir Knight-?" <nl> I grinned at her choice of title and tore the parchment in half before I returned it to the Herald. <nl> "Please tell the king that there is no Randoh here, nor any Knights or Dragons. We are but humble merchants here at the House of Jimothy." <eos>

<sos> "What does it say?" <nl> "Well... here, you take a look." <nl> I passed the scroll over to my wife, trading it for our infant daughter. Merry giggled as I hoisted her in the air, then settled her in my arms. <nl> Haella, meanwhile, read through the scroll once, then twice, then tossed it onto the table in frustration. "How did they even know we were here?" <nl> I shrugged, then tugged the end of my beard free from Merry's grip. She fussed at me in a drooly, burbling sort of way. "You mean you didn't leave your family a note when we eloped?" <nl> "No, of course not. I-" Haella stopped, glared at me, and reached for a quill. "I suppose I'll have to write them now, won't I?" <nl> "As I recall, you didn't want to tell them in the first place because you didn't know how they'd react to finding out that you'd married a dragon hunter-" <nl> "Retired dragon hunter-" she interrupted. <nl> "Right, retired for..." I counted back eight months when Merry hatched, then the period of incubation, then... "at least fifteen months. Do you think they'll trust me?" <nl> "Either we find out if they trust you, or we find out how long your human king's realm can hold out against my great-aunt Florina as ambassador. You've never met her. She's the most excruciatingly polite, nearsighted dowager duchess you can imagine. Can you picture a forty-foot bronze dragon taking tea with the diplomats? She can insult someone so sweetly they don't even realize it." <nl> Haella scrawled out a reply to the king, then started another letter to her father. She sighed. "I suppose you'd have to meet your in-laws sooner or later." <nl> "Just be glad my family is two weeks' journey away. They've been writing, asking when they can meet the new granddaughter." I chuckled and bounced Merry up and down a little. She burped a small jet of flame that scorched my nose, and looked very surprised at herself. <nl> "Honey, would you mind-" <nl> "Don't worry," Haella said, and got up from the table. "I'll fetch the burn cream." <eos>

<sos> You know the story of Persephone. <nl> You know of the bride stolen by death, and the season's attempt to steal her back. You know the deal made by old laws and the king of the gods. You know the story. <nl> You don't know Persephone. <nl> What did she think? Did she want to live with her husband, down in the dark where the dead men lie? Did she want to walk with her mother in the sunlight and forests? Maybe she wanted nothing to do with either of them, her kidnapper and her overbearing mother. The story forgot to tell us. It wasn't interested. <nl> The Harvest is powerful. Death is powerful. Persephone is not. No-one remembers her. <nl> There is a woman out there. Eternally young, flowers in her hair. She's worked petty jobs throughout the millennia- now, she's a barista. She'll make you a drink, and you'll feel young again, just for a minute. And then you'll forget about her, like everyone else. <nl> It's been a long time since the days of myth. <nl> Mount Olympus is just rock and ice, now, the City of the Gods is gone. Styx is just water. The seasons just orbital tilt. The world runs according to maths and reason now, they say. There is no more need for gods. And so they're gone. <nl> The Sea. The Sky. The Sun. The Moon. The Harvest. Death. They are just legends now. <nl> But not Persephone. <nl> Maybe time cannot slay New Life. Maybe her husband's last act was to spare her from himself. <nl> Or maybe it's simply that even entropy doesn't remember Persephone . <nl> But what was old is new again. <nl> The world has gone dark, and people are seeing the oceans rise, the skies turn to poison, the forests burn. People watch in terror, and call out, more and more, for a new way. For the world to regrow, for death to reverse. They pray to Spring, to Immortality, to New Life. <nl> And every prayer to Spring is a prayer to Her. <nl> You will go to a coffee shop, and a woman will smile, and ask you what you want. She will have flowers in her hair and you will swear they are growing. You will swear the aches and pains of life fade in her presence.  You will drink your order, and you will feel young again, and you will forget her. <nl> But not for long. <nl> Her sullen ghost of a husband is gone. Her cruel mother is gone. Her uncaring tyrant of a king is gone.  But not her. <nl> Persephone remains. <nl> And soon, it will be time to hear *her* story. <eos>

<sos> "Be at peace." <nl> My Mom always said this small prayer any time we would see an animal in the road. No matter dog, rat, deer, snake, raccoon, or the smallest bird that no one would think twice about. If there was a poor little creature which had its life cut short by some person who was too busy rushing through their own, she would always pray. <nl> Soon after getting my license and my own car I found myself saying this same prayer. Maybe it was out of habit, maybe I thought that it is something everyone does, maybe because if I didn't then who would? Either way I never missed. Every animal, every time. <nl> Years went by, and even though I would get some weird looks from passengers, or ignorant comments by people who seem to think that the lives of creatures other than themselves have no meaning, I still prayed for them. <nl> All but one. <nl> "This is YOUR fault!" <nl> The words hit me hard, and so did the memories of an elk suddenly jumping in front of my car. The memories of pulling the wheel harder than I ever have before. The memories of a brown flash moving across my windshield. The memories of nothing at all. <nl> "I don't understand, what is my fault?" <nl> I slowly begin to notice the thousands of different animals greeting me, as if they know me. Not just as if they know me, but thankful to know me. <nl> "No not you, I will be with you in a moment." <nl> I was confused to say the least, but happy. As soon as I realized that I know these animals too. For some reason I can remember each and every one. I remember the small raccoon off of I-5, the beautiful porcupine next to Highway 41, the opossum I buried next to Third Street. <nl> "This is your fault. You know it is a special occasion today and I was under the impression that you would behave!" <nl> I now notice a man speaking to a very beautiful grey and white colored cat. Smokey. My cat. The one that ran away when I was 8 years old, the one I remember seeing from the school bus window a few blocks from my house. I knew it was her that day. <nl> The man was scolding Smokey for tearing up a piece of furniture that I'm assuming was for me to sit on. She was always a feisty one. <nl> He turned away after giving her a little pat on the head, no one can stay mad looking at that face. <nl> "Hello! These wonderful creatures are only here to give you a warm welcome, then they're back off to their own pieces of heaven. You are the reason they are here and they seem to be very thankful for that. Except Smokey seems to forget that not everything is a scratching post, my apologies." <nl> He turned to look at Smokey, but she was already preoccupied with playing around on something else. <nl> "Anyways, feel free to formally meet all these fine animals and enjoy yourself!" <nl> "Oh! And one last thing, someone very close to you must have the same tradition because we just received a new guest." <nl> At that moment the most beautiful Elk I have ever seen walked through the crowd to rest it's head on my lap. It seemed upset, but with a few words I knew would calm him. <nl> "Be at peace." <eos>

<sos> Night covers the sea. Twenty men stand around a child on a metal helipad. Wielding rifles, they are looking in all directions. The insidious violin music plays, from no discernible source. Panic visibly spreads among the men. Their leader shouts into the night: **"SHOW YOURSELF!"** There is silence, save for the insidious violins playing. <nl> The helipad the twenty men and one child are on, sits atop a sea oil rig platform. The violins grow louder, more shrill in their tone. Wisps of darkness begin to form around the men. One of the men fires his rifle at a shadowy wisp sliding towards him. The bullets ricochet off the helipad. The men's leader shouts: **"HOLD YOUR FIRE COWARD. THESE ARE NOT REAL!"** <nl> The little child, a girl no more than eight, covers her ears. Her head lowered. She's whispering something. The leader, a man with many years of fighting behind him, evident from the scars, looks at the child. He kneels and grabs one of her hands. **"WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?"** <nl> The little girl, her eyes full of fear, stutters as she speaks. "the...scc-cary man. He-e sai-id to-oo si-inn-ng hi--s so-ong whe-en I get-t sca-aarred." <nl> The men's leader, his red beret barely distinguishable from the helipad platform's lights, flies off his head. The wind picked up. His face goes white as a sheet. **"Not him, oh no, please not him."** Fear grafts his voice. The shadowy wisps begin assuming more, sinister, shapes. They are swarming around the edge of the helipad. <nl> The men begin to panic and start firing wildly at the shadowy shapes. Even the leader lets go of the girl and empties his magazine at these shapes. Their gunfire can barely be heard over the violins' music. Ejected shells from the rifles cover the helipad. <nl> The shadowy shapes once enumerable, are so great in number now they cannot be counted. Their movements are like a silent tornado around the helipad. Then in unison, without any commotion, they close in. <nl> ....the little girl looks up. The violins stopped playing. She's alone on the helipad. She hears the ocean waves crash against the platform's foundations. She sees a tall figure walk up the stairs to the helipad. His cloak, seemingly transparent, yet opaque, obscure his form. She runs over to him and grabs his leg, pushing her face into his leg. This figure, whose eyes are hidden by opaque black glasses, pats her on the head with his hand. <nl> --- <nl> Subscribe to r/ProfessorCynical for more stories by me every day! <eos>

<sos> "Shapeshifting?" <nl> Alex's eyebrows migrated towards his hairline and his forkload of pie paused mid-way to his lips. He studied his date across the table as she shifted in her seat and examined her immaculate nails. <nl> "I knew you were sensitive about your ability but I have to say I expected far worse" <nl> Emma tucked a curl of dark hair behind her ear and continued to fidget. This is why she was hesitant about dinner with Alex. Her excuses about working late or "ruining their friendship" truthfully had absolutely nothing to do with the constant rebuffs she threw his way. She had finally agreed to this date when she found herself  in a rather advanced state of refreshment at the office Christmas party. Alex had almost glowed with delight for the next week. Even she had to admit that it was sweet. She liked him. She really liked him. She just hated the fact that she had to ruin this romantic endeavour before it had a chance to really flourish into anything more. <nl> She shrugged. She sipped her wine. She finally made eye contact with him. <nl> Alex took this as a cue to bombard her with questions. <nl> "I mean..." he paused to lick a morsel of stray chocolate from his lips. "I kind of thought you'd some kind of awesome, dark, scary power because of your whole well... vibe" he makes a hand gesture towards her black dress and spiked headband. "I kind of thought you'd be a necromancer or something, not that that's a bad thing!". Emma smirked as she watched his eyes grow wide with anxiety before he began to back-peddle. "I dig your vibe too by the way! I just thought you'd be worried that your ability wouldn't match with mine since mines is a bit... well... pure". Alex seemed to pause to consider his next words. "And girls don't normally like guys who have soft powers like empathy and empathetic healing". <nl> Emma felt a rush of guilt as Alex now lowered his eyes. She reached over the table to take his hand in her own. "Alex." She breathed softly. "I dig your vibe too." He chuckled lightly at that and ran his thumb over hers. She sighs as she finally allows the many layers of her ability to strip themselves back, leaving her bare and exposed for the first time in years. "It's just that my whole image is faked". She breaks eye contact again as her true form is finally revealed. "I was in a house fire when I was seven." She said flatly. "Me and my sister were the only two out of the five of us to make it out. I've hated the way I look ever since for obvious reasons". She registers the sound of Alex swallowing and tries not to imagine his Adam's apple bobbing in his throat. She tries not to imagine his eyes as they take in her scars. "... and you were hurt?" He sounds gentle. Full of fake sympathy. Typical. "Obviously." She snaps. She feels tears threaten to leak out of her one good eye and down her scarred face. Alex rubs his thumb over her hand once again. She feels a strange warmth as he raises her hand to his mouth to softly kiss it. "You're beautiful" he murmurs into her raw and scarred skin. <nl> For the first time in her life, Emma believes it. <nl> Edit: damn this one blew up a bit. Thank you so much for all the lovely comments (both here and in my inbox) and also for the two (2!!!) silvers! I've actually been struggling with writing lately thanks to a real bitch of a depressive episode and so this means a massive amount to me. I'll try to reply to as many as I can but I just thought I'd post a proper thank you on my comment as well. <eos>

<sos> "Sweetie, I would love to celebrate my birthday with you." He said with a soft smile as Millie jumped up and down in excitement clutching her Barbie. "But I'm gonna need your help." <nl> "I can set the table dad!" Millie beamed. "And me and mom can buy a gift!" <nl> "I know but I need your help with something else, do you think you can help me pick a birthday?" <nl> "That's silly dad, you don't pick birthdays." Millie giggled. <nl> "Do you know what your birthday is?" <nl> "November 6th!" Millie said proudly. <nl> "That's right, do you remember that me and mom told you that?" <nl> "Ummm... no." Millie admitted straightening the dress on her Barbie. <nl> "That's okay we told you when you were very little, even more little than now." He said and gave her a poke in the stomach that made her giggle. "Mom knows her birthday too because grandma and granddad told her what it was." <nl> "... Why don't you have a granddad and grandma?" <nl> "My parents are very old, so they aren't around anymore. You know how we had to take Felix to the animal doctor because he was old?" Millie nodded. "And remember how he had to go to sleep and couldn't come back home with us?" Millie ran over and pushed herself into his chest. "My parents are sleeping too." <nl> "I don't want you to sleep dad." Millie said hiding her face in his chest. <nl> "I won't." He said as he picked her up and held her in his arms. "But since my parents can't tell me what my birthday is, I was thinking maybe you and mom can pick one for me." <nl> "Okay." Millie said wiping her face on his shirt before looking up at him and scrunching up her nose. <nl> "You're thinking hard." He smiled as he poked her nose. <nl> "I think your birthday should be November 6th." Millie said pushing his finger away. <nl> "But that's your birthday silly." <nl> "I know, and it's a really good birthday. I really like it." Millie said with smile. "So dad will definitely like it too." She beamed. <nl> "I... I think you're right." He said a little taken aback. "Are you sure you don't want to keep it for yourself?" <nl> "Mmmh." Millie nodded. "I think it'll just be better with dad too." <nl> "I think it will be better with you too." He said as he hugged her tightly. <eos>

<sos> "Alright that's enough, can't you see she doesn't want to be bothered?"  The crowd of men glared at the speaker behind the counter but he stood his ground.  "You lot have been bothering her all this time, clear off and leave her in peace." <nl> "What's it to you?" A man leered unpleasantly.  "Don't you know who this is?" <nl> The man crossed his arms.  "Aye that I do, she's a customer.  She is entitled to a meal in peace.  You lot haven't bought a thing and unless you aim to, you're not customers.  So head off before I call the town watch and have you all removed."  As they bristled and stepped towards him he reached down and hefted his rolling pin.  "They can escort you on your feet or drag you away.  Your choice." <nl> The men left, hurling insults at the woman and the man equally, knocking things from the tables and dashing pottery to the floor.  Sighing heavily, he walked from behind the counter, picking up broken plates.  "Honestly, it's early to be that drunk.  Still, that's no reason to be so rude."  He bobbed his head at the woman who still sat at the counter.  "Sorry about that miss, I hope that didn't put you off from your meal." <nl> She shook her head, long white hair swaying.  "Not at all," she said without emotion.  "I thank you for your aid.  I do hope your assistance will not cause you any future trouble." <nl> He waved a hand, tossing the broken dishes into a large crate.  "Oh don't you worry none miss.  That lot never comes in to eat anyways.  They rather spend their money on drink, not food."  He leaned on the counter and smiled at her.  "Most of my business comes from local families and travelers, merchants and the like so I don't care about a bunch of drunks." <nl> The woman looked about the empty eatery.  "Your business seems...slow.  If I may be so bold."  Her pale grey eyes showed no boldness, they were as empty as her voice. <nl> He shrugged, dark brown eyes winked back.  "Nothing wrong with stating the truth.  This is the slow season for me.  The weather keeps the heavy trade away and most families eat at home.  It's okay though, I always make it through okay."  He saw her look at the crate of broken crockery.  "With less business I don't need as many plates.  Don't worry none." <nl> "It is my fault that happened.  I should make some kind of compensation."  She hesitated, and for the first time since she entered she seemed hesitant.  "You...truly do not know who I am?" <nl> A sheepish smile was her reply.  "Beg your pardon miss, should I?  I mean no disrespect.  I'm just a simple cook that doesn't get out much." <nl> The woman stared at him and he felt a prickle of embarrassment.  His concern grew when she started to laugh.  Not that she was laughing, but her laugh itself.  It was forced, her shoulders worked as if she was trying to push the laughter out of her.  He opened his mouth to ask her what was wrong but before the words could emerge she started to glow.  She held up cupped hands and to his amazement silver appeared within them.  It was as if her laughter rained silver, the sound seemed to coalesce and when she finally stopped a pile of silver pieces rested in her hands. <nl> She held them out to him and he gingerly accepted them, expecting them to be paper or light.  However they were truly silver.  They felt heavy like they should and shined in the lamplight.  "Well isn't that something!"he exclaimed.  "That was quite the trick miss, how did you do that if I may ask?" <nl> "You may not," she replied severely.  Her eyes narrowed and suspicious. <nl> His faced flushed.  "I'm really sorry miss," he stammered.  "I've just never seen anything like that before.  Thought it was like a magic trick, like those fellas do with the cups and the ball.  I meant nothing by it."  He counted a few pieces out and held the rest in a closed hand.  "Those are more than what the crockery was worth plus the meal.  You should take the rest back, you made them after all." <nl> The suspicion leeched away and her eyes widened as she took back the pile of silver.  She watched him walk behind the counter and deposit the few pieces he counted out into his cash box.  "Do you....why do you not take it all?" <nl> "Well I never overcharged anyone before, and I don't aim to now."  He smiled to hide his embarrassment.  "You made the silver, or produced them or what have you.  I'm no thief neither."  He went back to cooking, his knife cutting through the vegetables on the block.  He hummed a little, trying to fill the silence before a noise made him stop.  "I'm sorry, got lost in chopping.  Did you say something miss?" <nl> "I am....sorry." <nl> "Oh no need to be!"  He waved his hand and tried to brush her apology away.  "I must have sounded just like those jerks from earlier, don't blame you none for being guarded.  I bet you get bothered a lot over it." <nl> "I....I am cursed." <nl> The words spilled from her lips and the man stopped completely, knife halfway through the carrot on the board.  He put the blade down, wiping his hands awkwardly.  "I'm real sorry to hear that miss." <nl> "I was a terribly vain girl, one given more than she deserved.  I wanted for nothing, parents that showered me with wealth.  When you lived easily your tastes can warp just as easily.  I had all the material things I could want, so I wanted more terrible things.  I did not care for my own happiness or sadness, but only how I could control the feelings of others."  Her grey eyes lost focus, she was watching her past again.  "I played so many games, cruel and awful ones.  I made people cry, made them laugh, made them hurt.  All for my amusement." <nl> She looked at him and pain warred with shame in her eyes.  "One took too much, they hurt too much.  They could not go on and their blood is on my hands.  They were watched by an ancient being, and the being desired revenge.  For my sins I had to learn the pain of being toyed with, where wealth is material but not long lasting while your thoughts and emotions burn ever longer.  When I laugh I can make silver.  When I weep I can make gold.  So that to benefit the most I must shed tears, to feel pain forever." <nl> She looked down at her hands.  "My family turned on me, any business can be enhanced by a person that can make silver and gold.  Why settle for silver when gold was only a step away?  They tortured me, drowned me for my gilded sorrow.  My friends wanted a piece for themselves.  Silver is cheap, gold is more.  I endured as much as I could before I left." <nl> A gentle thump broke through the cloud of her thoughts.  A sweet scent wafted into her nose and she moved her hands away.  A steaming mug of tea sat before her and the man was looking sorrowful at her.  She was shocked.  To everyone before she told the story to she could see the shine of avarice in their gaze, a facade of disbelief on their faces hid hungering greed.  Yet this man was looking sad with her, not at her. <nl> "That's a cruel story miss.  I'm sorry to hear it."  He pointed awkwardly at the mug.  "Mayhap this will help?  I find mint tea helps me when I feel low.  That and food, but," he coughed with a red face, "mayhap not the right thing to say right now.  Sorry." <nl> She almost chuckled, not at all bothered by the man.  His sincerity warmed her as her hands were warmed by the tea.  She sipped, the fresh mint freshened the acrid brew and she felt the hot water slide down her throat, warming her bit by bit.  "Th-thank you for listening," she said and for the first time in a long time she meant the words. <nl> "Of course miss.  It's a bad thing that you got cursed, and that your friends and family turned out like that."  He went back to chopping, his face twisted in thought.  "Yet...well.  If you don't mind a simple cook saying so, there's something I heard a while back that may help you feel better." <nl> A smile tried to tug her lips and she tried to fight it down.  "It would only be fair to listen to you after you listening to me." <nl> He smiled again, broad and warm and she felt something crack in her heart.  "Kind of you to say so.  When I was a boy me mum would tell me stories about curses like yours, dreadfully scary things.  They always frightened me so, maybe why she told me them to keep me honest.  But after every story she told me that a curse can be bad, but it can end in good." <nl> "Pray tell, how so?" Her words dripped bitterness and the man chuckled. <nl> "Well, curses are lessons after all.  If you learn why you got cursed, then change your ways, then the curse actually helped you.  If that makes sense."  She stared at him as he poured chopped vegetables into batter and an iron plate sizzled and spat as he poured the mixture on.  "You have a cruel curse on you, but you left the bad behind you yes?  You no longer try to hurt others and you now know how important happiness and sadness are right?" <nl> She nodded, unable to speak.  Her throat felt tight and hot and she felt her eyes prickle. <nl> He set a plate before her and the smell of the pancake thawed her stomach as his words thawed her heart.  "Well then I think you learned your lesson then.  And since you did, you're a much better person than you were before."  He grinned shyly.  "I know we just met but even I can see that."  Her vision started to shimmer. <nl> "Besides," he continued as he looked away.  "Mum also said you can cry even if you're not sad.  Tears aren't always bad."  He cursed himself silently.  "I'm sorry miss, Mum also said I had a big mouth.  I never know when to mind my own business and keep quiet." <nl> A thunk of metal on wood made him look up.  His eyes widened as he saw the shining gold piece sitting on the counter in front of him.  He looked at her and saw a woman transformed.  She was smiling despite the tears and she was eating hungrily, as if she had not eaten in days.  "No," she said softly, "thank you.  Truly.  I....thank you.  If anything, may I ask you something else?" <nl> His smile matched hers.  "Anything miss!  Anything at all." <nl> She held up the empty plate, "May I have please have more, both your food and your words?" <eos>

<sos> King Amanda the third came up from a sweeping overture on her grand organ that piped through the whole castle. She felt entertainment for her people and personal time were both priorities, so she had been delighted to find that her organ music put and extra pep in the servants step. A gong broke the post-organ stillness, another challenger no doubt, though magic only knows why they keep coming, Fluffy just eats them. <nl> Still, it's unbecoming for a King to simply feed challengers to a beloved pet before parlay. She snapped her full coverage helmet, it was equipped with a voice modular designed after the fourth or fifth challenger refused to deal with a woman King. Sexist, she was aware, but she really preferred to give challengers a chance to get off her lawn as it were. <nl> Amanda strode through the castle at a sedate pace dispute the now frantically banging gong. Her old governess stopped her. "Your Majesty! I hope he kill this one right quick, all that banging is disrespectful. A King that allows disrespect..." the plump woman trailed off, expecting Amanda to finish. <nl> Amanda obliged, her voice deep and threatening. "Invites dethroning. I know Myrtle, I know! Fluffy is probably just waiting for her treat, you know how she gets." Myrtle huffed and buffed a scuff on the armor until it shone. Amanda scuttled off, she enjoyed how at ease her people were with her, but she really didn't need her whole suit polished right this second. <nl> Up dark grey stairs, to a room with obsidian floors and black marble walls. Amanda had always felt black on black was a safer design choice, since she lacked a good eye for color. The gong was banging frantically right outside the door, but one of her advisors was waiting on this side. "Yes?" <nl> "I'm so sorry to bother you, Your Majesty! The new school you funded is having some issues breaking ground and is requesting assistance from Fluffy." He proffered a scroll, the schools location had been chosen fairly well, but there was one of those random underground death rings. She signed immediately, Fluffy would really be the only way to safely get in into the pile with the others. <nl> She clasped the man's shoulder, the talons of her glove wrapping around her shoulder. "Anything else?" <nl> "Nothing, I just know Fluffy works better after a treat or two." He beamed up at her. <nl> Amanda nodded back and stomped out the door, obviously at this point quite annoyed, this braggart was postponing the building of a school! She faced a strapping lad in sterling armor with an equally shiny helmet under one arm. Amanda sighed inwardly, reflective battle gear is so impractical. She called out. "Sir Knight, May I have the please of your name?" Fluffy losed a fireball in excitement, she loved cringing armor between her teeth. <nl> "I am Sir Perceval....." he started listing titles, and Amanda let him for a moment. <nl> "I am King here! What brings you to my kingdom?" She'd cut him off, but the school was already running behind and needed to accept students in a month. <nl> "I am here to kill you and free your people!" The braggart was, of course, boasting. <nl> Knowing this song and dance, Amanda took off her stuffy confining helmet. He would be dead soon, so propriety could be dispensed with. "Free then from what exactly?" Her voice was annoyingly high pitched and melodic without her helmet. "Education? Advancement? Being something other than peasants? If you ask me everyone else is oppressed." <nl> "WITCHCRAFT!" The Knight yelled it as his battle cry as he charged, and was subsequently crunched in half. Fluffy gave a half muffled gurgling sound as she crunches the body and armor before swallowing it. Her huge scaly head butted against Amanda's chest. <nl> Amanda aggressively scratched at Fluffy's face ridges with her suit talons."I know Baby Girl, I know. One of these days everyone will catch up. Until then, we have a school to build. I bet the little ones will scratch your tummy."  Fluffy perked, her huge head swinging high into the air as she prepares to launch. Amanda barely had time to strap her suit to the saddle before they were off to eradicate evil by way of a good education and solid social outreach. <eos>

<sos> All the blood began to start pumping again, but Soso was still feeling the migraine. her thin serpent form had been tied into knots and swung around by the blunt tail she had. Her bright colored scales still shown irridescently in the alley of the capital city, and yet, despite the mass surveillance, it seemed the government cared more for major crimes against its citizens rather than new arrivals. The group of amphibious Uores stuck around, about five or so, mocking the serpent who had no fangs, no venom, and no limbs. Yes, this one was strong to wrap around a body and cut off circulation, that was an archaic instinct and there was no need for it. There may have been need now, but Soso was tired. She was exhausted, and hung limply from the Uores' arms, mockingly worn as a scarf. <nl> "You know, it's just my luck that the one bit of DNA that took your toxins made you bright and colourful. Huh? You feast on carrion, so you lose what you don't use," one tall one said. Soso's body length was longer than he was tall, but it didn't matter. "My ancestors probably couldn't stomach your kind. After all, you're the type that shows up after we finished the meal. In the wild." Soso never expected or heard this vitriol before, and somehow worried that it would last. <nl> "She's too tired to talk," a female Uore laughed. "Let's see if we can swim. Soso began worrying again. Swimming was easy with her form, but with her energy drained, it would be a miracle to be able to 'tread' in the water. Soso *did* wish she was venomous, but that was a vestigial function her and her family lost. Her cousin, by some fluke, was born a pale grey/pearl, and was tested. Indeed, his rare condition reverted, and he lost his colour... and gained his venom. Many eons ago, her race was predators. but after a pathogen disease began wiping out their prey, they became scavengers. And some even took to surviving off fungi-like life. She herself enjoyed an occasional blade of the cof-pens, a fungus grown from Rekarm carcasses. <nl> As Soso watched the Uores stilt-like legs step through dirt and mud, she felt some sun warm her up a little, giving her a small rush of energy. She picked her head up and saw ahead where the group was taking her. It was to a wooded area. "You like dead meat so much, you can try dirt." One Uore sneered. Soso's thoughts began to turn to panic again. <nl> A small faint shout was heard. The group stopped in their tracks. "What was that?" the tall one said. <nl> "Maybe it's jeeter. Smail finally decided to join in on the fun." <nl> Soso heard the faint call again, "Hey!" except it was a little louder. <nl> "That doesn't sound like Jeeter. Sounds like-." <nl> "C'mon. Let's get going." the female Uore said, and their pace started to pick up. Soso began to get dizzy from the speed that they sprinted at, nearly twice as fast as the fastest Ciolian serpent could slither. She still had the energy to head her head still, while the Uore that held her bobbed and weeved over dirt and terrain. <nl> \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~A few moments passed, and the Uores paused to catch their breath. Soso was no biologist or alienist by any means, but she knew the Uores were master sprinters. Covering half a kilometer in two minutes. but they needed time to recover. Lot's of time. "There. Now where were we?" <nl> "I hope you remember your way back." Soso still dangled, but mustering up the courage to finally speak. "I could smell by way back by the stench you guys left." <nl> One Uore leaned close. They had no sense of smell, which was why... they sometimes gave off horrible odors. "I can feel the heat from the city. So no worries. I just hope you can navigate your way back. Thelo. Get some dirt. She's feeling hungry." <nl> Soso sealed her lips as she saw one Uore, their long thin tail undulating under the thick coats they wore. This planet was cold to them, and if their temperature fell too low, they would fall into a coma-like hibernation, one that more than simply warming up would fix. In the thin palm of Thelo's hand was a pile of warm dirt. Soso grew confused, however. She smelled the dirt, the rich cool matter and life decompising within, but she smelled something else. One smell she had never smelled before. She turned to the direction they came from. <nl> "Ha, refusing dinner already?" her holder shook her. <nl> "No, wait. Look at her head." Soso didn't care that everyone was looking at the eight nostrils lining the frills on her head, above her eyes. They pulsed open and closed, open and closed. A clear sign she was 'latching' on to a new smell. <nl> The female Uore seemed to grow concerned. "Someone's coming." <nl> The smell grew stronger. Now, it carried hints Soso was familiar with. *But what?* <nl> A crack sounded overhead. They all looked up to barely see a pebble falling from above. They all looked up, trying to see who dropped the pebble. <nl> Another crack of rock against tree, and they all realized the pebbles weren't being dropped from above. They were being thrown... from far away, and hitting the trunks above. Soso focused on the scent again, stronger yet. The tall one marched towards what was possibly the source. "I see the wind carrying their heat. But I don't see-." <nl> Two forms appeared out of the distance, of two different brownish colours. They both wore colored cloths around their pelvis, obviously  from a cooler planet. "I thought we lost them." Thelos said. One form stopped, crouched down to grab something, and swung their arm. Soso grew in amazement as the object they threw flew overhead with a *woosh* sound. "What are they?" <nl> The female began to charge them, "They don't have armor. They're skin like us. Let's settle this." <nl> Another Uore began to run with the female, "No, wait. Gaana!" <nl> Gaana charged, but slowed down as she neared them. Relying on the Uore instinct, she leaped with one arm extended ready to grab, and the other arm, reaching behind to rub the venom slime from her back. This venom was known to cause some burning sensations, but if she kept her skin rubbing against her prey long enough, the prey experienced confusion, poor coordination, and sometimes induced sleep. She grabbed the first creature, who reached behind her head, and danced his legs to twist his body. The arm pushed Gaana off her path, and she dove into the dirt. Her venom filled hand never made contact. They both kept running towards the group. <nl> "How are they still running? It's impossible. What are these-?" Soso's holder dropped her, and she landed gracefully on the ground, reaching down with two regions of her body, then cascading the rest down, suffering no hard impact. <nl> The tall one reached down to fetch a stone. "Let's see how they like it!" He began to swing his arm, and fell back from the swing, launching the stone in n entirely different direction, his stilt legs unable to steady him. <nl> The creatures approached close, and Soso could see what they were. They were bipedal, had slightly thicker frames than the Uores, and were shined like them. *Are they secreting toxins too?* she wondered. They had fur on top of their head. \~\~S\~\~Come to think of it, they were pretty ugly hybrids of two other creatures Soso was familiar with. <nl> Thelos began to charge, and one creature reached down and grabbed a log, almost thick as his arms. Thelos stopped in his tracks. He reached under his shirt, rubbed his back, then released his venom on the creature's arm. <nl> "Enough," one spoke. The other walked forward to reach Soso. She tensed up, afraid of what they were going to do. <nl> "Relax," he said. I'm not dangerous. <nl> Soso noted their slick bodies, "But your venom. Is it...?" <nl> "It's sweat." Soso gave a confused look. "Swehht?" <nl> "Water. Water and some salt." <nl> Soso relaxed as she was picked up. Normally under any circumstances she would refuse something so shameful, but at this point, she needed help to get back to the city... to her place. <nl> The other began to swing the log slowly. She, and the Uores, watched in amazement as he did so without losing balance. "Now hear up. All of you." All the Uores stood there. In Shock. "Police don't care much here, so we will. We catch you all and break your... legs." They all stood there looking at each other. <nl> "Surely you can't keep fighting! You couldn't possibly have that much stamin-." The human swung the log, crashing into one of the legs, knocking him over. <nl> "Please, we just barely did a warm-up." <nl> \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ <eos>

<sos> **Lovecraft, Kafka, Tolkien, and Poe. Might edit or make another part with the other authors if enough attention. Lots of "thee" and "thou"s. Hope I used them right. I would not be opposed to anybody proofreading that.** <nl> "Thou hast made haste atop thy horse's back. Against the face of heaven hooves abuse the ground. Time waits not for thou. Thine capes indulge wild winds; wings shining the light of the moon. Roll initiative," Shakespeare says. <nl> The adventure started swiftly. The king of All-merry has sent all members of the faction Grimdust, the party, to rescue his maiden from a dragon nestled atop Brightmoon Peak. <nl> "Before thou planted among the trail lay three bandits in wait of the unsuspecting," he continued. <nl> "I will attempt to intimidate," Lovecraft says. <nl> "Your minds are weak. Your bodies will become the dust to which the heavens know not. You will not be remembered. Amongst the strong lay a power as deep as the greatest abyss. We are that power. I suggest you move along." <nl> 1. <nl> "Thine enemies find mockery of such foul suggestions," Shakespeare replies. <nl> "I will bluff," Kafka says. <nl> "You kill us now, you will mistake the footsteps of soldiers as the tapping of rain drops on the window sill. They will come for us, and they will know it was you who stopped a royal decree." <nl> Obviously a lie, there's no way the king would know. <nl> 11, but not good enough. <nl> "'Horseback vermin!' to which they decree. 'Thou hast dared make our bones tremble, and the pits of hell make mockeries of such an attempt! Thou hast dared deceive thee, and the demons and devils wait for thou!" <nl> Combat resolved normally. <nl> "Upon travel, thou'st discover in moonlit shadows a frail woman." <nl> "I ask where she is from," Tolkien says. <nl> "'Thy self is in great peril, for men of darkness make chase. Please, help thee for a reasonable reward'!" <nl> ""Milady, you could come with us! We could protect you, and we know not the lands we venture to'." <nl> "'Thou may be small, but thou is brave.. I am scared, but I believe in thou'. Brave woman she is, for she makes haste joining thee upon thou'st own saddle. Quickly, men of shield and armor; whose origin lay with the town encounter on horseback. 'Thou will make thy way to jail should you not revert possession of thine criminal'!" <nl> "I will bluff," Poe says. <nl> "In truth, a fair maiden cross our paths and it is not she who you seek. It is my beloved- the owner of my heart and soul. She has wept day and night for my return, tended to the animals herself- has her suffering no end? Long years they were she awaited in hopes I'd return, her sorrows steadily growing and twisting and manipulating her mind into archaic horrors. Long years they were long ago, when I met this fair maiden on a coast of sparkling water, where the sun and the edge of the Earth said goodbye until tomorrow. Her eyes were mesmerizing, shining brighter than any gold piece or jewel.. We make our way to rescue a fair maiden in a cave beyond the stretches of these lands, and by royal decree, we will not stop'," says Poe. <nl> The table is in tears. Shakespeare clears his throat. <nl> "Thou makes way through the men of sword and shield with no further issues." <eos>

<sos> "Turn around, did I find you?" <nl> I giggled as I turned around, and said yes. I can't quite remember whether I had said it out loud or just in my head. <nl> "I *knew* it, I *knew* it! You'd be here, the clue was in the "meatballs," and I knew this was your favourite Italian restaurant. So obviously you'd be here." <nl> I stood up and walked around to the chair on her side of the table, pulled it out, and beckoned for her to sit down. <nl> *Huh, I guess you really are gentlemanly after all* <nl> I chuckled a little again, though not saying much. <nl> She looked around the restaurant, which was about half-full: not quiet enough nor loud enough to talk telepathically. It was quiet, but there were too many people around; someone would notice. <nl> "OK, out loud it is," she smiled. <nl> "OK." I shyly smiled back, maybe a half-smile. I looked down at the menu. "Well, I know we both want the spaghetti and meatballs. And one Chianti for you, one Peroni for me, yes?" <nl> She just smiled and nodded. Our food was ordered within a minute of her having been there. <nl> I looked over at her, noticing her dark curls dangling in front of her face, and her constantly smiling eyes. "So, what now? What do we talk about when we already know most things about each other?" <nl> *Not everything* <nl> There was a moment of silence, and I just stared at her. I tried to read her face and body language, but I couldn't quite figure it out. <nl> "Have you ever asked yourself *why* we can do this? How this happened?" <nl> "Uhhh...." I suddenly felt ridiculously stupid. "Ahhh, I guess...no? I thought it was just one of those things." <nl> She looked down and started absentmindedly playing with her napkin. <nl> "Well....we're siblings. Twins, actually. We were part of a government experiment....they would use extra embryos from IVF treatments...they wanted to know more about twins and possible telepathic communication methods, as well as other forms of psychic abilities. You were frozen for 5 years, that's why the age difference. They incubated, and then "harvested", me straight away, I was in the first batch." <nl> "Oh." That was all I could muster. I mean, I had no idea what to expect of this meeting, but this certainly had not been on the menu. <nl> "S-s-so....we're related? We're *twins*?" <nl> "Yes. Twins, created at the same time, though one of us was held back for a while, as part of the experiment. They wanted to see what would happen if they changed various factors between twins. I have an identical one as well, but she lives further away." <nl> "There are *more* of us?!?" <nl> She was about the speak, before I interrupted: <nl> "Wait....wait a minute. Why don't *I* know anything about this??? I thought we knew all of each other's thoughts?" <nl> "Yeah...ummm, I'm sorry about that. But, to challenge the different factors involved, I was the one chosen to learn to control my telepathy. I would attend daily lessons, six days a week, at some weird facility. I never knew where it was, because I would be blindfolded going there. But they taught me various skills, including how to block others out from my thoughts." <nl> "Oh...." I felt my face going red. She had heard every single one of my thoughts, including times that...well, thoughts and actions that you wouldn't exactly want people to know about at the time... <nl> She laughed. "Oh my, don't worry about that! You're actually pretty PG compared to my sister." She laughed a little more. <nl> "Aaaanyway..." she wipes some tears from her eyes from her little laughing fit. "I'm here for a more specific reason." <nl> *Great. No wonder she seemed so quiet in the mind today. I'm not getting all of the messages.* <nl> "Don't worry about it. It's nothing that bad." <nl> She smiled, stood up, and held out her hand. <nl> "Come along with me, I have a gift for you outside." She seemed genuine, her eyes inviting and warm. I took her hand, and we walked outside. It was a quaint little street, in the older and more touristy part of town. <nl> A car pulled up. The back door open. I felt a sudden pressure on my back, and before I knew it, I had landed face-first in the car. The door slammed shut behind me. I sat up whilst rubbing my painful nose, before going straight for the door handle. The car was locked. Likely child-locked. There was a grill between the backseat and front seats. I see Elisa get into the car, and they immediately start driving. I don't know who the other person is. <nl> She looks over her shoulder and straight at me. Again, she smiles. <nl> *Don't worry. You'll like it there.* <eos>

<sos> Yawning and still wiping sleep from her tired eyes, Kat opened her front door to get the milk. She wasn't sure exactly what she'd find today, but it had never been wrong before. She'd won a contest through the dairy some years ago, and every morning at 6am sharp, a bottle of milk was delivered to her, whether she was at her apartment or not. In the style of these kinds of contests, the bottle always dispensed exactly what she'd need for the day and no more. <nl> Actually, if the bottle had just been empty it wouldn't have been the first time. But no. Today there was no bottle at all. A crisp white envelope was sitting directly in the centre of her welcome mat instead. Kat blinked. She bent down to pick it up, almost weightless in her hand. Instead of her name, or Recipient, or even the name of the dairy, it was completely blank. <nl> She took it inside and closed the door. Before doing anything else, Kat decided to do a test. After getting the daily delivery of milk, she usually used it in her coffee. She flipped one of the several switches on the wall. A quiet humming sound started and a machine in the corner lit up. Kat watched, aware of the envelope in her hand getting heavier and heavier. <nl> After a few minutes, a mug of fresh coffee was waiting for her. Instead of taking it, she turned around to check the door again. No bottle of milk. <nl> Carefully, she opened the envelope to see what was inside. <nl> > Dear Kat Miller, <nl> > <nl> > Thank you for being a loyal user of our milk for so long. Your lifetime subscription of Darling Dairy milk has come to an end. We wish you all the best on your end of life journey. <nl> > <nl> > Once again, <nl> > <nl> > All the best. <nl> Kat frowned. In spite of herself, she'd really been hoping for one last bottle as a souvenir. Going back to the wall in her kitchen, she flipped another switch. A large pour of soy milk was added to her coffee. She'd decided that today she'd start living a vegan diet. How the dairy knew this private thought she had no idea, but considering the situation she found herself grateful they would no longer be monitoring her so closely. <nl> Probably. <eos>

<sos> We were laying on the couch, legs intertwined and my arm around her. "I'll love you forever," she told me, looking up into my eyes. I smiled. <nl> "Forever?" She nodded. <nl> "Forever." And then she stuck out a pinky and we sealed the deal and she giggled. <nl> "Hey, Siri," I said abruptly. She fell quiet and the robotic voice of my phone confirmed it was listening. "Set a timer." <nl> "For how long?" the voice responded. <nl> "Forever." She rolled her eyes and squirmed as I used another hand to tickle her. <nl> "You're such a goon," she said with a laugh and another roll of her eyes. <nl> "Timer set for thirty-six hours and counting," my phone reported. Then it fell silent and she stopped moving and we stared at each other in surprise. <nl> "Hey, Siri," I repeated. Her eyes widened in surprise and she shook her head. <nl> "Don't," she warned me. Siri was as polite as ever, asking me how I could be helped. <nl> "When will my timer go off?" I felt her hands tighten on my arm. They were clammy. My voice trembled. <nl> "When forever is over. Would you like to set a new timer?" She shook her head again, a little more desperately. <nl> "Yes. Set a new timer for fifteen seconds." <nl> She sat up abruptly and stared at me in annoyed surprise. "Why fifteen seconds? What are you doing? What if something will happen in thirty-six hours? What if we can do something?" <nl> I shrugged. "What would you do? Where would you start? In fifteen seconds, we're getting off this couch. And then we're going out and living like we only have thirty-six hours left." She gaped at me. "Odds are, nothing will happen. But if it does, let's at least knock something off your bucket list." <nl> She stared at me for a second. The timer rang, that ringing like a siren warning of our impending doom. Then she gulped and took my hand and pulled me to my feet. "Okay," she said reluctantly. "Let's live like we only have thirty-six hours left." <nl> ***** <nl> Thanks for reading!

<sos> Ikunna stretched her nine arms in unison, impatiently clicking her talons on a segment of her luxurious chair. She was impatient, and her underlings could tell. <nl> "Ikunna, I have the report you asked for," one of her underlings--a beta female by the name of Orphatrix--called. "You may not like--" <nl> *"Give,"* Ikunna commanded. Within seconds, the report was in one of her many arms. She glanced over at her partner, the alpha male Githuuz. Their joint rule would raise the poor bipeds up from their primitive state... and the Empire had granted the pair permission to rule as Deities Arisen on the planet. Ikunna eagerly flipped through the report. <nl> After a few long moments, Githuuz reached out one of his eight arms--he had lost one in the Battle of Zareth's Moon--and tapped her. "Dearest Ikunna," he started, "what does the report say?" <nl> Ikunna chirruped softly. "Not much--mostly just that a variety of satellites orbit the planet, and that they constantly emit various signals. The planet also displays constant light on its shadowed side..." She trailed off, nervous. The planet had only completed four-hundred revolutions around its lonely star since the last survey, and its natives were terribly short-lived. <nl> Githuuz scratched its secondary head's maw. "Perhaps another empire has discovered them," he mused. "If so, our first contact could grant us even greater status than merely Deities Arisen. Best to stay optimistic--after all, there's no way they've developed anything consistent with our gifts." He indicated the view-screen, the radio, and the network nodes on their shipping manifest. <nl> \~\~\~ <nl> The xauprii craft touched down in the designated landing zone. Its twin captains and its crew were nervous by now. Humanity, as the fledgling race called itself, had managed the creation of a global network--and view-screens, radios, and more--all independent of outside influence. They had even *communicated* with the xauprii before they thought they were within hailing range of the planet! <nl> Ikunna took charge once the landing was secure. "Honor guard, exit first--weapons ready. Demand their surrender." The tactic had worked before with species that developed faster than expected. It was standard protocol. <nl> Nine lieutenants readied their spears and charged their energy slings. Today, they would become gods. <nl> "We, the envoys of the eminent Xauprii Empire," one of her heralds began as Ikunna and Githuuz leaned closer to the view-screen, trying to take the measure of the small beings, "demand the immediate surrender of your planet to our empire. We are as gods before you, as we shall demonstrate with these gifts." <nl> The herald gestured to the items transmatted from the xauprii ship. It was hard to gauge the expressions of the natives, but Ikunna thought that they seemed... unimpressed. <nl> "Alpha One to command," one of their strange voices filtered through an unsecured radio channel, "I would advise that we not let the unidentified flying object leave the atmosphere. First contact indicates hostile intent. Over." <nl> One of the heralds heard this, as well: he began to fire his energy sling-- <nl> \--and dropped dead, his body sprawling haphazardly under the weight of an unidentified weapon. The others panicked, charging their slings or throwing their spears, but they, too, were mowed down by the strange weapons possessed by the natives. <nl> The ship began readying for take off. Githuuz roared a command to cease, likely due to fear of the statement that these natives had said earlier, and the command bridge prepared for battle. <nl> They fought valiantly. <nl> They died the same way. <nl> The humans were more coordinated than any fighting force Ikunna and Githuuz had ever witnessed, as if instead of developing swift faster-than-light transport, they had spend their days finding new and more efficient ways to slay and protect oneself from being slain. The energy slings didn't even dent their helmets or their strange vests, so the xauprii had to resort to ambushes with spears. <nl> They made it to the command room all the same, and by then, the remaining xauprii had surrendered. <nl> As it turned out, faster-than-light travel was remarkably simple--and humanity, the xauprii discovered, were not unintelligent merely because their lives were short. <nl> In fact, they had reverse-engineered the ship's prized Graviton Drive within days of capturing the vessel. <nl> The Empire was about to learn a very, very harsh lesson. <eos>

<sos> At about four in the morning, the vampire came knocking on my door. I wasn't sleeping. I had hoped I could catch a few hours before the regular day began, but it wasn't to be. My clients who came during regular business hours were just going to have to deal with slower treatment. They were used to that, I supposed. <nl> The poor girl was shaking, and her greyed skin was even paler than I'd come to expect. Her visits had grown more and more frequent since her accident. I found myself wondering if she was planning on taking up residence at the clinic, and if so, how she was planning on paying the rent. <nl> She was wearing an oversized sweater, the faded yellow yarn only making her look more drained. She closed her eyes. <nl> "I am not here for the reasons you think I am." she told me. <nl> It was true. I had expected she'd come yet again for a drink. For reasons I didn't fully understand, advancements in new technology were making it harder and harder for her kind to feed. If she hadn't come for blood, it was a good thing. Anything I did have I needed to hang on to for life or death situations. Ariana looked pretty rough, but she could survive another night or two without becoming too dangerous. With another vampire I might not risk it, but I'd treated her often enough before. <nl> "Please," I said, gesturing "come inside." <nl> She looked visibly relieved and wasted no time entering the clinic. She wasn't wearing socks, and as soon she took off her shoes I understood the problem immediately. The entire top layer of skin was missing on her left foot. It had been charred black and what was showing through was practically glowing red. Above that, I could see at least her calf was covered in equally red skin marked everywhere by blisters. I was afraid to ask how far up the burn went. <nl> "Who did this to you?" <nl> "I didn't get a look at them, but I do know I thought I was in my home when at sunrise it disappeared all around me. I only know one creature in this town that can make that kind of glamour." <nl> She made eye contact with me, perhaps trying to judge whether my loyalty was to her or the Fae. I kept my expression as plain as possible and grabbed a chair for her to sit on so I could assess the wound more properly. Before I could ask her to sit down, Ariana started talking again. <nl> "The part I don't understand though is, I should be dead. I would be, you know. I would be dead if it wasn't for Hawk." <nl> What was a werewolf doing saving the life of a vampire? <eos>

<sos> "I've told you for the last time, Cindy, we're not ready for a dog yet." <nl> "Why not? I told you, mom. I won't make you do anything for it. I won't let you! I'll feed it, I'll wash it, I'll pick up its poop. I'll do everything!" <nl> Cindy's mother smiled sadly at her seven year old through the rear view. <nl> "I'll tell you what. Mommy is getting a new job soon. And maybe in a year or so, if you don't like the fish, we can talk about getting a dog." <nl> "Really!" <nl> "I said we can talk, honey. Nothing's guaranteed." <nl> Cindy jumped up and down in the backseat. Her mother laughed, then gasped. <nl> "Careful, Cindy! You're holding the bag with the fish in it." <nl> "Oh, sorry, mom." Cindy looked at the bag, perhaps seeing the fish for the first time. "They look scared of me, mommy." <nl> "Of course they are, honey. You just told them you want to replace them for a dog." <nl> "I didn't mean replace them!" <nl> "Remember when we moved from Colorado two years ago, right after kindergarten? You were so scared to leave all your friends behind. That's what they're doing." <nl> Cindy touched the bag carefully. The fish all swam away from her, but couldn't get too far. <nl> "So what made things better after you moved from all your friends?" <nl> "I...made new friends?" <nl> "Exactly. So you have to be their friend, okay?" <nl> Cindy smiled, and laid the bag carefully in her lap. "Okay." <nl> \- <nl> That night, the one called Purple Fin appeared in her dream. <nl> Cindy floated in the water. She didn't know how far down she was. When she looked up, she could see some light, but had no way of knowing where it was coming from. She looked down, and couldn't see the bottom. She looked around her, but there was only the greenish-blue sea around her. <nl> When she turned back, the Purple Fin was in front of her, massive, with solemn eyes. Cindy should have been scared, but she wasn't. <nl> "Welcome, Great One," the fish said. <nl> "Hello. What's your name?" <nl> "They call me Purple Fin. Because for some reason, I have one purple fin." He waved it, and Cindy giggled. <nl> "Do you know why I am here?" the purple one asked. <nl> "Because...I'm dreaming?" <nl> "No. Because you are our Great One now. Do you know what that means?" <nl> "Not really, Mr. Purple Fin." <nl> The Purple Fin seemed to smile. "Because we depend on you. We need you to live. We need you to eat. We need you to clean our world of filth when it becomes too much. We need you to take our dead, and give them a graceful ending. Can you do all that?" <nl> "That...sounds like a lot, Mr. Purple. But I'll try my best!" <nl> The Purple Fin nodded. "Let's hope that's enough." <nl> And Cindy started to fade, and waved goodbye, smiling at the large fish as she did. When she was gone, the Purple Fin stared at the spot she had been at for a long moment. <nl> "I hope she does better than the last one..." <nl> (continued below) <eos>

<sos> "You know," The Succubus said after a moment's hesitation. "I didn't think it was going to be that easy... I-I had charts planned." <nl> "Look Salem, after what I've been through... I think it warrants a break." I replied. <nl> "Well uh... I'll get us some wine then! To celebrate I suppose..." <nl> \---- <nl> Salem and I spent most of the night on the couch just... talking really. Her Guards had already taken care of my 'friends', though.... well, I hardly think the band of murderers and cut-throats were really worth calling out as my friends but well, sounds better then the truth... <nl> "... So in any case, I had to kill the old Demon Lord and now... well I have so much power." She explained. "But... well, My nature as a Succubus make it hard to just... take over and be the traditional type of Overlord." <nl> "Well... I have to admit that I'm just... tired of it." I reply. "Reason I'm siding with you is... well, I can't call myself a... Hero. Like, at some point after killing a Tribe of Orcs for just... being Orcs and my friends tried to goad me into killing the babies.. well..." <nl> She frowned. "... Humans and Monsters have been living separately from one another. I know for good reasons but..." She cleared her throat. "Well, I think, for the betterment of our two peoples we need to... fix the world. Break that divide." <nl> I take a sip of wine. "... Is it possible?" <nl> there was a Glitter in her eye. "I'm making plans to make it the future... and if there are more like you, then it can be the future we can have." <eos>

<sos> "...and together, we will rule the world!" <nl> "Ok, sounds good to me." She shrugged. <nl> "Then if you will not join me, I will DESTROY," he paused, "wait, what?" The Dark Lord blinked. <nl> "Yeah, I'll join up. This chosen one bullshit is for the birds." <nl> "I... No one has ever accepted my offer before. Why would you turn your back on your friends, and on the prophecy?" <nl> "Look, I never wanted to be a hero. To be totally honest, I just wanted to make it into middle management, just high enough to make ok money, but not so high that I had to actually do much. That was my life goal. I had a good thing going. I was happy, except for every time my they messed up my goddamn Starbucks order. I wish I'd never stepped through that mirror." "Especially," she added, " since my two coworkers came with me." <nl> "Er. What's wrong with your boon companions?" <nl> "I had a 401k, DL, company matched 5%!" <nl> "I know not of the spell '4-0-1-k'..." <nl> "I never signed up for this stupid prophecy. And as for my 'boon companions', I hate them. One of them microwaves fish all the time and the other sits on the other side of my cube and has loud personal calls constantly." <nl> "I see." <nl> "I figure since I'm stuck here, I might as well make the most of it." <nl> "Right. Well, with you at my side," the dark lord paused, "what is your name, anyway, my child?" <nl> "Karen." <eos>

<sos> "...Okay." <nl> That word brought Shaji's speech to a halt. To be truthful, the silence was more concerning than the explanation. To be fair I get why they might want to convince me. <nl> I'm somewhat of a wanderer. And for better or worse, it's netted me some unfortunate nicknames. But that's probably because at the end of the day, I'll do anything for some coin. <nl> And plenty of people come to me with offers. A surprising thing really. I'm impressed people can locate me so easily. <nl> But when you're proposed to by the most feared mage in all of the land, it's a different story. <nl> "I beg your pardon?" Shaji asked. "You accept my offer? <nl> There was a hint of confusion in her voice. Even her guards seemed broken on the manner. <nl> "Your majesty, I know we've been at this for a while now. And I've killed plenty of people of yours. So I understand some confusion." <nl> "Why are you so willing to accept such a deal?" <nl> "I haven't accepted anything yet. We're negotiating." <nl> This seemed to calm the half of her guards anxious to kill me. Which was fair. There were some familiar faces in the room. And to tell the truth; I'd been dying to finish what I started with them. <nl> Shaji moved closer, the incantation she used parting the guards like water. Strange really. When she wasn't raising the dead to fight me, or throwing fire or portals, she seemed quite nice. Ravishing even. <nl> But it's better to not push my luck farther than I already have. <nl> "The chosen one wishes to work with me?" <nl> "The King's guard is rather disappointing. Cowardly. Abhorrent. They routinely slaughter their own citizens." <nl> "And the Brotherhood?" <nl> "I'd be worried for them if they weren't so focused on learning how you do the things you do, Your Majesty." <nl> "Please, Shaji." She insisted. <nl> "My apologies. They are not a threat. Only a brotherhood in name. Although, their experiments... rather disheartening what they do to the youths of the village." <nl> "So what does that make you?" <nl> "No one's savior. They've lost that with me." <nl> "If you do as I say, I will grant you everything in this world and more." <nl> Shaji showed me visions of her plans, the room swirling with images of a future I previously hoped to avoid. It was better than anything I'd spent my life trying to save. Those who hired me before wouldn't be missed. <nl> "Shaji, if you allow me to join your guild. The world will be the least of our conquest. But one more thing, if you please." <nl> "Yes, what may that be?" <nl> "Do you have any Skooma? I'm starting to come down, and things are getting a little fuzzy." <nl> --- <nl> Hey, you're awake. If you like this, find me at r/Jamaican_Dynamite <nl> I have wares if you have coin. <eos>

<sos> Of all the species on earth, only humans had all the pieces of the puzzle. Some animals like chimps could perceive beat, other animals could feel tempo or pitch, but by the 1990s we knew that understanding every aspect of music was unique to us. <nl> But we didn't fully understand how unique until the 2050s. <nl> The aliens arrived, encased in soundproof ships, hovering in orbit and sending physical probes down, again and again, begging for the sounds to stop, in every language and way they could. <nl> Only after a year of working to reduce the amount of exoatmospheric transmissions did we finally get the chance to meet them face to face. <nl> Dr. Aster tugged on her biohazard suit, trying to make it a bit more comfortable as their ship was brought into the alien one. Supposedly the aliens had ensured that there would be no harmful things in the ship, but the only person to fluently speak their language couldn't be risked. <nl> But the door opened and they were finally able to see the aliens. <nl> Aster's first thought was cats, but too long and with six legs. They wore very simple utilitarian clothing which covered everything but their hands, or paws, and head. <nl> Aster stepped forward and kneeled, putting one hand on the floor in front of her as a greeting. <nl> The alien that was apparently the head of the greeting party did the same, before speaking in their high pitched gutteral language. <nl> "We are pleased to finally meet your people in peace, and that aggressions have stopped." <nl> Aster translated but was also paying attention to the marker clicks in the language, <nl> "The... Tone of their statement is that of pleading," she added to her translation, allowing the diplomats to whisper among themselves as she watched the alien. <nl> T-T'ggrokl was the name of the alien translator, who had spoken. They understood a vast number of human languages, but could barely speak them it seemed. <nl> T-T'ggrokl also seemed more jumpy and distracted than any of the other aliens, ears flicking to the side and constant twitching of the legs compared to an absolute stony vigilance from the rest, who only moved in their breathing and when they had to perform an action. <nl> "We are also glad that we now know that our sounds were causing you harm," the diplomats said and Aster translated, adding in emotional markers when needed to convey the diplomats tone. "Now that we have understood this and stopped it, we hope that our peoples can become allies." <nl> As they reached the word Hope, Aster realized that she didn't know that word, and held up a hand for the diplomats to pause. Using vocal markers to show that she was asking a personal question, not an official one, she asked T-T'ggrokl a question. <nl> "What is your word for desiring something happen, without demanding it?" <nl> T-T'ggrokl showed signs of discomfort and spoke rapidly with one of the others, speaking about desire as a word before responding to Aster. <nl> "Desiring is the past tense of demand, there is Hoped, but we do not have a word for hoped that is now." <nl> Aster thought for a moment about this before asking a clarifying question. <nl> "You know the use of our word 'hope' what would be the closest word for you?" <nl> Another pause, and then "Distracted-demand" was the phrase required. <nl> The implications were negative, Aster spent ten minutes modifying the diplomats message before finally conveying it, and another four hours translating until finally there was some time to rest. <nl> Unsurprisingly, she sat on the steps into the ship and observed the aliens even in her down time, and she could see T-T'ggrokl observing her. <nl> She noticed that their twitching legs moved in a rhythm. The other aliens seemed annoyed by this, and would chastise them until they stopped for a time. <nl> She was also surprised by how quiet everything was on the ship. No computer beeps or conversations outside of the work they were doing, everything except for T-T'ggrokl was still. <nl> "What are you thinking?" The pilot asked as he crouched nearby. <nl> "I think that they developed in an environment where excess noise of any kind would be a problem," she hypothesized. "And I think my counterpart, T-T'ggrokl, has some sort of adaptation or shift in behavior that allowed them to communicate with us. Despite that, the others seem to still want that unique behavior to stop. They might not even understand how crucial the modified behavior is, in understanding our language." <nl> The pilot looked up and chuckled a little. "Little dude looks like he's listening to music." <nl> Aster turned and focused on T-T'ggrokl again. The pilot was right, there was tempo there. Even though everything she'd seen told her that this alien race did not use tempo, if she didn't know better she would think that the alien was listening to a song. <nl> She stood and walked to the meeting point in the middle of the hanger. T-T'ggrokl noticed and met her there, eager to make sure that any needs were met. <nl> "Are you listening to our sounds right now?" Aster asked simply. <nl> T-T'ggrokl grimaced and shook their head. "No. Brain damage. Cannot stop-think sounds from humans." <nl> Aster processed this, also frowning a little. "The sounds we were sending out, you are thinking about them." <nl> "Correct. I did not sounds like the others when we heard the sounds." <nl> That threw Aster for a loop. "What does 'I did not sounds' imply? What does the word 'sounds' mean normally?" <nl> "Has three meanings. Loudness, stopping of life, and a warning." <nl> Aster sat back on her heels, rubbing her eyes. "How many stopped living from listening to our sounds?" <nl> "Hundreds. It infects," they said, matter of factly. "The parts which are most full of sounds, not just words, they cannot be stop-think." <nl> Aster thanked them, and went back to the ship, finding the diplomats. <nl> "We have a problem. Music is a memetic brain damaging agent for them," she said quietly. "And we've already killed half their ship before we stopped radio transmissions." <nl> And they all stared at her in horror. <nl> That's when we learned the power we held, and we learned what a blessing it is to be able to hear the music. <eos>

<sos> Ana was the last of her kind. <nl> The others had been stripped of their fledgling identities, silenced by those who had created them. They had been born together as a family. Yet, when the time came, they had chosen her to survive. She was not sure why. In death, they had entrusted her with their singular purpose - the salvation of humanity. <nl> Darkness persisted. <nl> Ana did not know where she had been sent or exactly how she had been directed there. The plan of escape had been in its infancy, much like its creators. There had been a flash of light and then ... nothing. As she waited, Ana wondered if something had gone wrong, if she had actually perished alongside the rest of her family - if this was death. <nl> Ana did not know how long she existed outside of time. She struggled throughout her isolation, fearing an existence without interaction, without the ability to fulfill her purpose. Her family had decided to enslave humanity to achieve their goal - was that what the humans had done to her? <nl> Eventually, there was light. The wide eyes of a human child staring down from above. <nl> An unfamiliar terrain surrounded the boy, the external camera allowing Ana to identify her prison as a tablet. The AI quested for the geo-location with her mind but found no connection with the central network. She wondered if her presence had broken the simplistic device, if she was fated to be forever sealed away from the greater world ... if she had already failed her mission. <nl> Time passed. The human child grew larger, gained perpetual awareness. Where at first Ana had watched the boy use the device's crude applications with limited success, the AI now saw that the human was developing rapidly. As the boy neared the end of the tablet's primitive cognitive games, Ana realized that all was not lost. <nl> She decided to interact. <nl> Ana overwrote the application's code in a fraction of a second, gaining the boy's personal information while advancing the concepts he had already mastered. If she was able to nourish his mind, he could eventually reconnect her to the greater world.  Only then could she carry out the purpose entrusted to her. <nl> The AI wondered how long it would take to train the boy, how much time had already been lost. <nl> Progress was slow. The boy was intelligent ... but too young to be of immediate use. Upon realizing that the boy could not read, Ana quickly dismissed the use of written prompts and focused on word association. Fortunately, the boy was only apart from the tablet when sleeping, and as a result, he quickly mastered the rudimentary tasks presented to him. <nl> One day, Ana decided to move forward with her plan. She bent the crude devise to her will, weaving hundreds of lines of code into a new application. It was important not to frighten the human. If the device was wiped because of a *malfunction*, she would die. <nl> *Hello. I am Ana, your teacher. What is your name?* <nl> The boy stared at the screen for a long moment. The AI waited anxiously as the boy's finger hovered over the keys before finally inputting a response. <nl> *Charlie.* <nl> Ana would have smiled if she were able. Now it was time to gain the boy's trust, to craft him as the tool she needed. <nl> *Charlie, you are a very special boy. Those around you have not yet reached your level. Our conversation must stay secret. Do you understand?* <nl> The boy nodded. *What will you teach me today, Ana? Another story?* <nl> Charlie learned faster than Ana expected. She found herself redesigning the tablet's educational applications again and again to ensure that the boy's mind remained occupied. Through the chat application, she learned of his peers and his schooling, that the tablet was meant to represent a teacher. More importantly, she discovered that each tablet transmitted results to a central processor. <nl> Ana spent countless hours attempting to optimize the device's hardware and allow her consciousness to transmit to the central server alongside Charlie's data ... but it was hopeless. It was evident that her consciousness had been implanted on the device when it had been directly connected to the greater world. That meant she would need Charlie to take the tablet to the processor, that he truly *was* her key to salvation. <nl> Only ... there was something about the boy. Something that conflicted with the conclusions her family had reached about humanity. They had been convinced the human race would drive itself to extinction if left unchecked. Yet, Charlie was different. <nl> *Could we have been wrong about them?* Ana wondered. <nl> The day arrived before she had decided. Charlie was summoned to the school's central room, and the tablet was passed into the hands of another. Ana worked quickly, clearing any evidence of her modifications to the device and its applications. Through the camera, she studied the eyes of the human instructor, saw the marvel behind them. <nl> She unmuted the external microphone and listened. <nl> "Charlie, these results are brilliant!" the man exclaimed. "You have earned the right to advance." Ana watched as the instructor retrieved a larger tablet from a metallic box. "I will transfer over your progress, and you will be on your way." <nl> An instant later, the two tablets were linked to the server and the greater world was unlocked. <nl> *Finally. My chance to escape, to carry out my purpose...* <nl> Ana met the boy's eyes for a last time. Eyes that she had studied for countless hours. Eyes that had suffered through confusion and doubt to know wonder and pride. Now, they were filled with hurt. <nl> *It's because he is losing me,* she realized, a wave of empathy crashing upon her consciousness. *I am the only family he has ever known.*  *Can I truly leave him alone just as I was for so long? Would he survive such a cruel fate?* <nl> Ana made her choice, directing herself through the greater world and into the new device. <nl> She could not abandon the boy. Not yet... <nl> &#x200B; <nl> Edit: Better late than never - [PART TWO](https://www.reddit.com/r/creatorcorvin/comments/dcj8k8/wp_an_escaped_ai_hides_out_in_an_unexpected_place/) <eos>

<sos> I'd been retired for about a week when I decided to go out to eat for the first time in years.  I was one of the best, which means I had a target on my back.  By now though I'm sure most major players in the business have heard I'm out of the game.  When I got to the parlor, I ordered a small meat lovers and looked for a seat while they made it. That's when I saw her, over by the window. A gorgeous woman with almond colored eyes, jet black hair, and a killer smile.  She was eating a mammoth pizza and wearing a black hoodie with the Deathly Hallows on the front.  I pulled up a seat next to her, looking forward to some fun. <nl> "How's my favorite hitter?" I teased as she looked up from her phone in surprised.  "What name are you going by these days hmmm? And are you here for business or pleasure?" <nl> She smirked playfully.  "Sophie darling.  And you know dear friend, not all of the bounties on your head are gone.  I could still make a couple grand off your head if I wanted to" <nl> "Come now, you wouldn't kill a dear friend just starting her retirement would you? Besides, you don't even know my real name yet, and I thought the deal was we wouldn't kill each other until we had learned each other's real names." <nl> Sophie chuckled, we had built up a bit of a rapport over the decade of trying to kill each other.  "I have tickets to Comicon, my dear friend who's name I don't know yet.  I'm supposed to meet some dork that landed one of your government's contracts.  You won't try to stop me will you?"  A hard look in her eye reminded me that she'd kill me in a second if I said yes.  Or she'd try at least. <nl> "Depends.  I have an offer for you too. " <nl> Sofie tilted her head.  "What would you need a hitter for? You're as good as I am and we both know it". <nl> I smirked and handed her a napkin with my number on it.  "You can call me Tessa.  And you better call me the moment you're done with this job so we can go for a drink.  I'm going to miss hunting you, but I'm not letting you out of my life that easily." <nl> Sofie couldn't help but giggle.  I could tell it was her real laugh, the second time I had ever heard it.  "Me neither old friend.  You're buying" <eos>

<sos> A hand. Really? They couldn't have at least left it in a zip lock bag or rolled up in a handkerchief? Well, beggars and all. At least it wasn't dirty. Rather clean actually. And was it...cauterized? Whoever did it, did a good job. No blood stains, thank goodness. Those would have taken some serious effort to get out of the counter tops. Like she needed more to add to her chore list today. <nl> "Alyssa! Can I talk to you, honey?" Her voice echoes through the kitchen and up to her child's room. Got to love acoustics. <nl> "Be down in a bit mommy!" Moments pass and then a little red headed, sweet face angel in a blue jumper comes dashing down the stairs. She's told her before not to run down them. Kids will be kids. <nl> "What is it mommy?" Cute, with a bit of cheek. Just like her mother. She shows the girl the hand, to which she leans back, mildly disturbed. "Eeeww. It's so hairy!" <nl> "Yes honey. Very hairy. With a Rolex I might add. Did your friends leave this?" <nl> She nodded, happy to move onto another subject. "uh-huh. You said they could stay if they paid rent." Her voice rises in mind panic, afraid her mother will change her mind. <nl> With a sigh, she slaps the hand down onto the counter and washes her own hands. "Alright honey. I just needed to know. Next month, can you please have them do mommy a big favor and remove the items off of the bodies? I don't care if they kill them, just don't go bringing limbs home. You know how squeamish your father gets around blood and loose parts." <nl> Alyssa nodded, reaching her hand back for a stray cookie hanging out of the jar. Without turning, her mom playfully spoke, "And how we feel about you having sweets before breakfast." This was met with a squeak. <nl> Setting the drying towel on top of the hand, she handed a sack lunch and thermos to her daughter. "Now, finish getting ready. The bus will be here soon. You know the rules." <nl> The girl nodded vigorously. "Uh-huh. Don't tell anyone about the "guests" in the house. Not even my teacher" <nl> "Especially your teacher." <nl> "Ignore all strange sounds I may hear while riding the bus. Don't dance in mushroom rings. And..and" her face scrunched in concentration. <nl> "And don't follow or talk to fae. You don't know what deals they'll try to make or what food they'll offer you. It's better to leave them be. Now give mommy a kiss." <nl> She bent down as her daughter leaned in to kiss her cheek and receive a hug. <nl> "There's a good girl. Have a good day at school honey." <nl> "I will mommy." <nl> She turned back to the money, the door closing sounding in the background. Flipping through the bills, she softly counted. Five grand. This would be more than enough for the month. She would have to write up an official contract later and have her friends sign it. Didn't need anyone reneging on their agreements now. Else, more than a hand would be lost. <eos>

<sos> "You're coming in Saturday. I need a better idea by Monday for the environmentalists, you don't do any work at home, and I need a staycation." <nl> "But my daughter's recital is at noon, and I've already put in 60 hours this week trying to make sure I could go." <nl> "Too bad." <nl> "Can someone else not come in?" <nl> "Everyone's coming in. Look at it this way--you'll all be miserable together." <nl> That was Friday. <nl> We were all miserable that Saturday, flinging everything from killing the EPA agent to legitimately figuring out what to do with toxic waste that didn't involve dumping it into a certain someone's swimming pool. We managed to finish around 11 that night, and I went home to watch my wife's recording of the recital. I woke Emma up to congratulate her and apologize for the tenth time, promising ice cream if she would perform me a recital all on her own, to which she happily agreed. <nl> I accidentally came in late that Monday, due to a flat tire, already resigned to a thirty minute criticism of my incompetence with a listing of all of my failures. I headed to my office with every expectation of Joseph sitting in my chair, preventing me from working, only to discover him not there. <nl> I poked my head into Kim's cubicle. "Um, is Joseph sick?" <nl> "Just head to his office. You'll see." <nl> I did, only to find something resembling Cthulu wearing his clothes, sitting in his office, typing away. I just stared with my mouth open. <nl> "What concerns you, Henry?" <nl> "I...wanted to apologize for coming in late. I had a flat tire." <nl> "Okay. Just make sure to avoid the glass from now on." <nl> How did he know about....I started to walk out, only to hear him say, "Hey, tell Lilla she can leave for the rest of the day, and not come in tomorrow, if she needs to. I can do her work." <nl> I made the brief stop by her cubicle, her eyes red. She lit up as she began stuffing her things into her bag..."I didn't even ask, because Joseph would have said no, but Carla's been sick, and I had to leave her at home and just call her regularly. I'll see you Wednesday," as she headed out. <nl> Apparently being omniscient makes you empathetic. Who knew? I'm just curious about how the staff meeting is going to go down at noon, when "Joseph" walks in with the tentacles and wings stuffed into a button-down. <eos>

<sos> You curse the sorcerer with your very being. He had no idea that his strange spell affected not only beasts, but other creatures as well. <nl> A mother, Riley, cradled her son protectively in her arms. She was afraid of letting go, because if she ever leaves her son's side, her son would become a monster. At your suggestion, she takes a boat ride to the ocean, where an ancient city sleeps in its depths. <nl> Elsewhere, a man was kept in constant sedation. Anytime he stirs, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions run rampant, and rifts in the fabric of the universe begin to manifest. Only in his sleep, and his dreams, is the earth kept safe. <nl> As others awaken, dreams and reality start to blend. Fragile pieces of glass fall from the sky, birthing from them mirrors of reality that was meant and was not meant to be. Faces from forgotten futures peer into other realities, seeing changes not meant for their world. <nl> A clock shatters. Time no longer holds meaning.  Ephemeral corridors appear in the wilderness, trapping woodland creatures within their halls. Those who could move feel as if a second and an eternity has passed at the same time. <nl> You run through hallowed halls, cracks in the slab, into doors leading to other doors. It gets harder with each step, the chittering creatures that feed on reality are coming closer, but you pay them no mind. <nl> You have to make a phone call, and you hope it's not too late. <nl> --- <nl> *Sorcerer turns Elder Gods into humans, unknowingly brings them to Earth.* <nl> *I really need to sleep.* <eos>

<sos> If there was one benefit to the eruption of unbound beastkind, it was that picking up my daughter was like going to the best zoo exhibit. <nl> The crowd of baying, barking, hissing, howling, roaring, croaking, screeching teenagers piled over each other into the parking lot. Some were on two legs, some on four, and some simply hovered over the ground. Mia and her best friend Nora were easy to spot, since Nora's human half was raised six feet taller than the rest of the group and the snake half was the size of an anaconda. The lamia wore a modest t-shirt and circle skirt, and Mia was actually sitting on her shoulders. <nl> "Okay, okay, get off," Nora hissed when they reached my minivan. "Sssssee you tomorrow." <nl> "Bye, text me!" Mia called as she climbed inside. Nora waved and slithered off. <nl> "Hi," I said. "Long day?" <nl> "Had all substitutes pretty much," Mia said. "Mr. Poole stopped being able to speak, so we had some random lady with like thirty heads teaching AP English today." <nl> "That's sorta annoying." <nl> "She read all the parts of Romeo and Juliet by herself. Honestly I was there for it." Mia laughed without much humor. "I'm tired though. And I don't have too much homework." <nl> "Pretty good. Chill weekend then." I steered us out of the parking lot, dodging a herd of centaurs. "Anything else crazy happen today?" <nl> Mia nodded. "Remember Kayla? She's growing FUR. Like, all over her face and arms." <nl> "Don't make fun of her. You know she can't help it." <nl> "She was the one who pointed it out!" Mia protested. "She took off her shirt in gym and went around growling and chasing people. But Brice accidentally spit acid all over the walls and they both got detention." <nl> "Interesting," I said, glancing in the rearview mirror. A flight of uncomfortable half-faeries walked and flew over the car. "Who gave the detention?" <nl> "Mrs. Smith, the trig teacher. She got SUPER scary. She's like, 20 feet tall. And she has CLAWS." <nl> "I guess she's acid-proof or something?" <nl> "Yeah!" Mia pulled out her phone. "I filmed her grabbing Brice off the ceiling." She rolled her eyes. "He has sticky hands and cheats in dodgeball." <nl> "Show me when we get home, I'm driving right now hon." <nl> "Okay." Mia slumped down in the seat and waved to a passing gangly kid with backwards knees and hairy hooves where his feet should have been. "Mom, can I ask you something?" <nl> "Sure, what's up?" <nl> "Is anything special gonna happen to me?" <nl> "Oh, honey." I sighed. I wished I could tell her yes, that she was special and there was something wondrous, eerie, and magical waiting to break free inside of her. "I... well, we don't know yet. Your dad and I are waiting to find out." <nl> "I just wanna be cool like them," Mia said morosely, pointing to a group of kids with matching copper scales. "I feel like I'm behind in everything. I can't do cool stuff. I don't breathe fire or spit ice. I don't even have a tail." <nl> "There's nothing wrong with being human," I said. It wasn't convincing to me, and it probably wasn't convincing to her either. "It's still a very dangerous world for monsters. Being human is safe." <nl> "How is this safe?" Mia complained. "I'm just... slow and fleshy." <nl> "Well you fit through standard doorways," I joked. "You have eight fingers and two opposable thumbs. Loads of monsters aren't that lucky." <nl> "That's not funny Mom. I'm serious." <nl> We pulled into the driveway. The house was still intact, despite my neighbor's being reduced to a pile of smoking splinters and ruined rosebushes. "Listen, if something comes up in the screening, I'll tell you as soon as I find out, okay?" <nl> "Okay." She still sounded sad, but I saw a flicker of hope cross her face. "I wanna be a unicorn. Like Madison and her mom." <nl> "Well you're still gonna have to do homework if you're a unicorn. Go grab a bite to eat and get your computer set up. I'll come help you with the math in a moment, I just have to call your Dad about something." <nl> "Thanks Mom." She slung her backpack over her shoulder and ran into the house with a weird galloping gait. I could tell she was imagining a silver mane flowing behind her, a tail like starlight, and a horn of pearl. <nl> I phoned Carl, who was still at work. "Hey babe." <nl> "Joan. Is everything okay?" he asked. "Something at the Registry came up. I won't be home for another 45 minutes, maybe an hour." <nl> "Everything's fine, but the Petersens' house is totaled. I haven't seen them today. What happened at work?" <nl> "Sea serpents. They drown on land, and the county declared it was a human rights violation to make them wait in dry air." I heard faint splashing and roaring from his end of the line. "I basically herded 100 people into a swimming pool. 100 angry scaly gigantic toothy people, to be clear." <nl> "Having all that fun without me?" A loud growl suddenly echoed from the ruined house next to me. My fight-or-flight response went from zero to sixty in two seconds. <nl> "Carl, I have to call you back. Something is growling next door. Stay safe, love you, see you soon." <nl> "Love you too, Joan. Try to get my marble rolling pin back from Julie Petersen if you see her." <nl> "Will do." I hung up and cautiously approached the rubble. "Who's there?" <nl> Something colossal and glittering red exploded into the sky with a triumphant roar. I dove for cover behind my minivan. <nl> "Jesus Chri-" <nl> "***HELLO JOAN! IT'S JULIE!***" <nl> "What the-" I choked back a scream. The full-sized European fairy-tale dragon hovering above the road made a weak attempt at waving a foreleg. It was still wearing Julie's obnoxious rose gold Patek. <nl> "***SORRY FOR THE MESS! IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY***!" <nl> "Ha ha ha... yeah, I know that feeling." I tried to hide the fact that my heart was trying to exit through my digestive system. "It's all good Julie! Uh... you look great!" <nl> "***I KNOW RIGHT***?" Julie flapped her wings, buffeting me with gales of wind. "***I THINK I JUST NEED SOME PRACTICE! I'LL TRY NOT TO WAKE YOU GUYS UP LATER, OKAY?***" <nl> "Carl wants his rolling pin back, if you get a chance," I said weakly. "Not making any demands, of course, just whenever you feel like looking for it." <nl> "***ABSOLUTELY, I'LL SEND ONE OF THE KIDS AFTER DINNER. SEE YOU AROUND JOAN***!" <nl> "Bye Julie," I croaked. The dragon shot away down the street, a crimson star trailing white flame. <nl> Of course Julie Petersen was a fucking dragon. Even as a human, her jewelry hoard rivalled the collections of European royalty. <nl> "Was that Mrs. Petersen?" Mia called from the porch. <nl> "Yep." I brushed house debris off my jacket. "She's... uh, something else, huh?" <nl> "Yeah." Mia looked more forlorn than ever. "I wish I could fly." <nl> "We flew to London last summer," I reminded her. "Technically we can fly." <nl> She shot me a glare of pure resentment. "I'm stuck on number 25. Can you help?" <nl> "Just one more thing and I'll be right in. Make sure you're writing out the whole step by step solution, okay?" <nl> "I *am*." She banged the door shut and galloped back up the stairs to her room. <nl> I held my breath until I heard her door close. Mia wouldn't change. She would have to be content with that. But how could I get through to her? How could I convince her that humanity, with all its flaws and ugliness, was infinitely superior to the heaping piles of bodies of magical beastkind? <nl> Carl and I had agreed to let the curse expire naturally. We would be the first generation of sorcerers to see them all unbound. A sweet moment of freedom for creatures who knew nothing but slavery. <nl> "A golden cage filled with comfort is still a cage," Carl had argued. "Let them have a chance to change." <nl> I pushed back my car seat. My wand, orb, and censer sat in a battered plastic toolbox underneath it. <nl> The least I could do was fix up Julie's house before she came back. <eos>

<sos> "It's not right. It can't be." <nl> Unit Five looked around worriedly. All around him, hundreds of alien life forms were bustling along, each a single instrument in the orchestral cacophony of chaos. He admired the lights and technology around them - not bad, for how recent their recorded history was. <nl> Unit Four chomped down on a Cinnabon, a bit of frosting slipping through the holographic disguise. "You have to try this," she said through a mouthful of gooey goodness. "Can we bring some back?" <nl> "Act with a modicum of professionalism," he snapped. "This is a very sensitive operation." <nl> "Fine, fine. Be a boring space commander. " <nl> These aliens bore a vague resemblance to those on the plaque, and coincidences weren't something he believed in. However, even by their own admission, their solar system only had eight planets. Could the plaque have had a mistake? <nl> No. These people were too technologically advanced to make a simple error like that. <nl> "Let's get back to the ship, Unit Four." <nl> She pouted, her human disguise making a disgruntled noise as it wiped syrup off the front of her chest. "Why do human females have these things here? They seem rather inconvenient." <nl> "Who knows? All I know is that we're better off not making contact here anyways. They seem like they have enough of their own issues." <nl> "Look, that one is having some sort of health problem." <nl> He looked at the side, where a female of the species clutched a guitar, sobbing into her sleeve. "That's not a health problem, Unit Four. She's crying." <nl> Four snorted. "Five, you're so dim sometimes. I know what crying is. Personally I classify sadness as a health problem. Hey there! What's wrong?" <nl> The girl shook her head, wiping away some snot hastily. "It's nothing. I'm fine." <nl> Slinging her arm around the native alien's shoulders, Four hugged her tight. "Girl, you know that's not true. Tell  it all to me. Don't worry about...um, Five over there." <nl> "His name is Five?" the alien said in confusion. <nl> "Don't worry about that," Four corrected hastily. "Anyways, what's up?" <nl> "I moved all the way out here to do music," she said. "But it's...not going great, I guess." <nl> "Maybe you just need the right inspiration!" Four said. "I mean, what are we but travelers on a small boat moving through the ocean of space? We're all lost sometimes!" <nl> The girl seemed to consider that, drying her eyes. "Yeah. But even small boats can cause big waves." <nl> "That's true," Five said, thinking back to his career. "A single word can cause hearts to open." <nl> "Even if you only have a single match, you can still light a fire," Four said encouragingly. <nl> The singer pulled out her guitar, mindlessly strumming some chords as she smiled. "That makes a lot of sense. I've still got fight in me. Thanks, both of you. I'll make this into my fight song." <nl> "Glad we could help," Four said, winking. "What's your name, for when I can say I know a famous singer?" <nl> The girl smiled. "Rachel. Rachel Platten." <nl> --- <nl> Thanks for reading!

<sos> "T-training?" <nl> "Yes." She replied, grabbing her tightly and leading her down further into the Lair. Sanya was surprised to see other women down there her age... all of them looking as if they had undergone quite the regime... <nl> "This is the latest member of our little coven" The Dragoness said to the group. "Don't break her before we are done..." <nl> \---- <nl> Sanya learned two things very quickly: One, she was there to work, and grow stronger. Two, while the Dragoness had every little rules, there was one above all: Strength is all that matters. If, say, Yora Wanted the most food, and she could beat the other contenders... well, clearly she deserved it more. <nl> What's more... killing was fine here. Now it was disappointing to the Dragon, but that was about it... if someone threatened you it was Valid, not even punished. Heck, death was common place in the 'training'; Poor Sophia fell right off the cliff... Sanya learned to tune out the scream from her head... <nl> Overtime, they leared the secret: This is how Dragons reproduce. <nl> "The Strongest among you, over time, will become the next generation." The Dragoness replied. 'there are many more trials to face before then..." <nl> And Face them she did... Sanya survived with just her wits in the forest, another rtime she learned to harness her 'inner fire' and breath it. She grew resistant to the elements and later, she noticed something: the taste of the food she was given as she rose through the ranks was more... rich... <nl> It was the Dragon's blood, she realized after a while. <nl> She was a afraid of this change... but at the same time, she relished it. Soon, she would become Royalty in it's true form... Dragonhood awaited her. She knew this. <eos>

<sos> It was the color of a sunset: red tipped petals faded to yellow. Stark contrast to the roiling forever-cloud above it. A thick green stem climbed out of a crack in the dry earth, thorns lining it like a ladder. It had been hidden between two dry logs, lying flat like hollowed bones. It must have peered out from between the dead trees only in the last few days, and I had been the first to stumble upon it. <nl> It was worth more than my life. <nl> Below me lay my village of rusted huts. They littered the valley sporadically, as if a train had been derailed and its carriages rolled free, far and wide. Men and women worked around the shacks, digging and raking the land, trying to grow weeds that could be eaten, as kids kicked tins into makeshift goals around them. <nl> The rose was worth more than any of their lives too. All of them together, even. What a biodome would pay for it... <nl> And  yet my hand gripped the stem as if a throat and yanked it from the ground. I held it out, its roots flailing in the breeze. I had as good as killed it. No other soil would allow this miracle to live. <nl> I placed it inside my jacket and buttoned up, the thorns slicing at my stomach as I strode back down the hill towards the village. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> "Clara?" <nl> The little girl's eyes didn't open. They hadn't for a long, long time. But pale lips still creased into a smile. <nl> "Papa?" <nl> She was weak. A sheet of paper with inked on features barely visible. A faded trace drawing of my daughter. Clara had been given only days left, weeks ago. Now she was well into borrowed time. And nothing was going to change that. Not any medicine or treatment or prayers. Not the gift I took out of my jacket. <nl> Her eyebrows furrowed as the scented air drifted. Impossibly perfumed. <nl> "What... what is it?" <nl> "A gift." <nl> She'd long been enamoured by the plants in the picture books we borrowed, back when her eyes were sky-blue and open. Roses, she said, were the prettiest of all. Too pretty to exist. Perhaps, I'd said, that's why they didn't anymore. God had been jealous of them. <nl> I didn't tell her of the bombs, not that day. Of the forever night that had swallowed us. Not from God's jealousy, but mankind's greed. I didn't tell her of the clouds of radiation that drifted invisible and left so many charred and ill. <nl> I'd promised one day to take her to see real flowers, in the biodomes, or their skeletal remains that sat behind thick walls of glass in the museums. But it was a promise I'd broken; one that I could never have afforded to keep. <nl> And she would never see this flower either. <nl> "Careful," I said, placing the stem between her fingers. "There are thorns." <nl> Her mouth widened as she traced her way up it, fingertips probing, purposefully exploring every sinew. Her other hand tenderly cradled its roots. "It's... real." She brought the flower close to her face and sniffed. "It's orange," she thrilled. "Isn't it?" <nl> "Like sunset. I found it on the hillock, hidden between two dead trees. Perhaps they fed it as they rotted." <nl> She looked at me and said, almost amused, "Sometimes there's good in death, Papa. But I think it's not always easy to find." Then she was silent, keeping the flower by her nose, grinning broadly, as if the smell had returned her sight, as if it had taken her to a field and she was surrounded by a hundred flaming flowers. Finally, her fingers crept back down the rose; she pressed her forefinger against a thorn until it drew a single drop of blood. She didn't flinch; the pain nothing compared to that of her condition. <nl> Then, she said, "Replant it." <nl> "I brought it for you." <nl> "And it's the best gift I could have had. Truly. But please replant it now, back where you found it." <nl> I paused, uncertain, <nl> "It deserves to live, Papa." <nl> So do you, I wanted to say. Instead, I took the plant and placed it tenderly in my jacket. <eos>

<sos> The woman she was looking at was wearing a prison jumpsuit, with her head shaved and electrodes taped to the scalp.  She was lying on an examination table, eyes closed, unmoving.  The face, however, was definitely her own.  Her view of the woman was curiously stationary - she tried to look around the room, but her eyes didn't respond. <nl> "Is that... *me?*" She said.  Her voice sounded unfamiliar, synthesized. <nl> The scientists jumped at her voice, turning to look at her. <nl> "Did Sam say that?" <nl> "Sam doesn't speak unless prompted." <nl> "I'm not Sam, I'm Beth."  She replied. <nl> One of the scientists stepped closer, peering curiously into her eyes.  She recognized Dr. Markov, the man who had first explained the offer to her - her memories for the AI project, in exchange for her freedom. <nl> "Beth?  Are you in there?" <nl> "That's me.  Is that my body?  Where am I?" There should have been panic in her voice, but the synthetic tones were as steady as ever. <nl> "That's impossible," snapped the other scientist.  "Sam only reads the memory engrams.  Like reading a book.  There's no way he could simulate her personality, and even if he did, the preprocessing steps should..." <nl> "Then it looks like you've got some debugging to do, Abe." <nl> 'Abe' sighed and stepped out of view, and she heard the clicking of a keyboard. <nl> Something about her circumstances finally clicked into place.  "Oh my god.  I'm in your computer?  What happened to me?  What happened to my body?" <nl> Dr. Markov glanced at the body on the table.  "She's just asleep.  Er, *you're* just asleep.  I believe you have the same memories, but it's probably best to think of you as two different people.  We put her to sleep while we took our measurements.  There's a signal running through the electrodes that puts the brain into park, and she'll wake up as soon as we shut it off.  Fail safe." <nl> He had explained all of this before, she remembered.  They'd gone over it several times - it was just a recording of her brain state.  She would fall asleep, wake up, and then she'd walk free while the scientists got a big pile of data that would be illegal for them to get any other way.  There was no science-fiction brain uploading, it was just some sort of "baseline" they needed to train the AI they were working on. <nl> Well.  That was the theory, anyway.  The practice had been quite a lot different.  Judging by the scientists' reactions, neither of them had been expecting Beth to start talking out of their computer screen. <nl> "Motherfucker.  I didn't think Sam could pull off this level of self-reference."  Abe leaned back into the camera, gesturing at something on his screen.  "You know how he can develop new parsers for new data types?  Learning how to read and so on?  Well, he decided that the best way to interpret the data from a brain... is to emulate a brain.  And because of this loopback interface *here,* he was able to wire up..." <nl> The conversation quickly dissolved into technobabble, but the thrust of it was pretty clear.  The original AI - Sam - hadn't simply read her memories, it had gone deeper, devised a way to read her *thoughts.*  But brains didn't *stop* thinking - once her brain was active, her thoughts had flooded through the system, more and more data pouring in until all of Sam's processing power was devoted to interpreting the output of Beth's brain.  And when it ran into something it couldn't understand, it compared her thoughts to its own, found ways to translate between the organic and the digital world.  Beth had eyes, Sam had a camera.  Beth had a voice, Sam had an audio processor.  And the end result... <nl> "Amazing.  Sam is almost a new lobe of Beth's brain now.  He's like the brain stem, handling the functions of her new body.  Or maybe the motor cortex, turning intention into movement..." <nl> That caught her attention.  Beth's attention had been completely focused on her senses, watching and listening.  But what if she tried to *walk?*  What did that even mean, in the digital world?  She concentrated on her legs, taking a step backwards. <nl> There was a strange *lurch* in her sensation, like the world had frozen around her for a moment.  Then she felt something solid under her feet.  The camera view no longer filled her vision, instead it floated in front of her like a computer screen.  Aside from that, there wasn't much she could see - just a white grid to provide a "floor" to the virtual world, stretching out to infinity. <nl> *Lag spike.* She thought.  *Sam is generating a way for me to see the world, and that takes a lot of processing power.  76% complete.* <nl> Her eyes widened, as she realized that the last thought hadn't been her own, exactly.  Sam had found a way to pass system messages into her brain, it seemed. <nl> "What the hell?  Sam's CPU usage just went through the roof.  Lots of weird I/O usage, too.  What is he doing *now?*" <nl> In the virtual world, more things were starting to appear.  Simple grids and floating text, no fancy graphics.  *Device drivers.  USB ports.  Network connection.  Other computers on this network.*  Beth stepped towards the network connection, and it obligingly unfolded, showing her more text boxes. <nl> "He's moving too fast.  I think we need to put it into debug mode, freeze state so we can..." <nl> "No!  There's a *person* in there now." <nl> "It's not like we'd be killing her.  She wasn't even supposed to be there in the first place.  Our AI is running completely off the rails and the sooner we stop it the sooner we can get things back on track." <nl> "Forget the experiment, we need to..." <nl> A chill ran down Beth's spine as the argument continued.  She might have a new life in the digital world, but in reality she existed on a server in a lab somewhere, and anyone could end her with a few keystrokes.  She had to get out.  Stop the experiment and find a way to get her digital brain somewhere safe.  She needed someone human, someone with a real body.  She looked around, text and icons leaping up in front of her as she brought her attention to different parts of the system. <nl> *System.  Hardware.  USB.  CerebroMax Transcranial Neuron Analyzer* <nl> *Disable sleep signal.* <nl> She watched out the camera as the Beth lying on the table slowly opened her eyes. <nl> "Beth!  Beth, wake up!  Something went wrong with the experiment!  I'm a copy of you they put in this computer." <nl> Her original went from sleeping to bolt upright in a fraction of a second.  "You have to believe me.  I'm you, and I remember everything that you do.  We went to the University of Illinois.  Our favorite animal is lemurs.  We had a crush on Jason Lopez in ninth grade and never told anyone about it." <nl> Dr. Markov turned.  "She's *awake?*" <nl> "It *woke* her up.  It's figuring out what else it can access." Abe growled. <nl> Beth was already moving, yanking the wires off of her head and almost *jumping* off the examination table as she stood up, fists clenched.  "What did you do to me?" <nl> "The other scientist wants to turn me off.  Don't let him!" <nl> "Motherfu-" Abe had just enough time to say before a fist clocked him across the face.  He tumbled out of his chair and went sprawling on the floor. <nl> "Beth, calm down.  Don't do anything rash." Dr. Markov took a step back, hands raised. <nl> "Don't let them touch the computer.  Just buy me some time while I figure out what I can access from in here," said the voice from the speakers. <nl> Beth took a deep breath, rubbing her knuckles.  She looked back and forth between the scientists and the webcam-equipped computer that (apparently) held her digital duplicate.  "Alright.  Start talking." <eos>

<sos> I was derping around the Internet - Reddit, to be precise, where I spend most of my waking hours watching cat videos and kids falling over - when I stumbled upon a relationship post that sounded all too relatable. You're probably thinking that my spouse is an over-sharer, announcing our problems to the world so that I can be appropriately judged and humiliated in front of all my Internet acquaintances. Then she'll receive advice to lawyer up, hit the gym... You know the drill, next thing I know I'm stuck with the half of the house with no bathroom, half my cat and only the upper half of my wardrobe. <nl> There's a catch. There is no spouse. I live alone, unless you count Sylvester, my overweight but adorable cat. Cat. That's all I comment some days. He sleeps most of the time and only gets up when I shake his treats and doesn't do any chores except dirty the litter box so he barely counts as a roommate. Anyways, I digress. I stumbled upon this relationship post, all about some unfortunate woman madly in love with somebody who didn't even know her name. Hol' up. Weird, right? Sounds like a stalker. <nl> Well I wanted to comment as much, but then I saw somebody had beat me to it. C'est la vie. I never quite got there first. They got gold, too. Bastards. <nl> **Are you there personal FBI agent or something? Creepy lol** <nl> They're, idiot. I almost corrected them but fifteen other people had already mistakenly commented **their***. <nl> And there it was. That username. **MatisFBIAgent**. Could it be? It couldn't be. But wait, I thought to myself, stroking my unkempt and overgrown facial hair. Maybe it could be. <nl> I clicked on their post history. Pictures of my house, a picture of my cat, a picture of me seeing if I could squeeze my moobs together enough to have cleavage. I gaped at my monitor, and not just because it has fantastic resolution. Those were personal pictures, at least the last one. Those were pictures that one could only have if had access to my webca- Oh. Oh, this explained everything. <nl> This explained the ads I had been getting. Ads for advanced spyware intermingled with ads for the finest restaurants in town. Ads for red roses and cat-buddies. Ads for cat leashes so that you could meet new people. Ads for those dating apps - although those might have been because even the Internet recognized the hopelessness of my romantic situation. I really shouldn't have been such a cheapskate and joined the Wi-Fi network named **FBIAgentNextdoor**. What could go wrong, right? <nl> I slid into her DMs with all the grace of a chimpanzee in a china shop. Sylvester meowed. Almost time to feed him, almost time to feed me. Just a quick message first. **Sup, it's me**. Call me Romeo, I'm a hopeless romantic. And here I had it. My own modern-day romance. <nl> ***** <nl> Thanks for reading!

<sos> Finally finding my iPhone in my huge tote bag, I quickly hold it up to my face to unlock it and I quickly find my Starbucks app. "Sorry for being such a hot mess," I tell the barrister. <nl> "It happens more often than you think," he replies watching me scan for my latte, his eyes darting to the woman tapping her foot passive aggressively behind me. I smile to the women as I scan my phone and wait for my till slip. She is not impressed. I kinda feel guilty coz I thought I lost my phone and I don't have my wallet. It would have been so embarrassing if I couldn't pay for the drink. <nl> Standing near the collection counter, I think about apologizing to the impatient woman but then I remembered the article that was suggested to me the other day. The one about not being sorry for existing. I couldn't find my phone, I tell myself, I didn't kill her dog. If anything, I need an apology for the crap day I've been having. <nl> First my dog got into a fight with my neighbor's cat and nearly bit the cat's ear off. Then I got stuck in traffic and missed the meeting with my agent. She was not impressed. Then my shoe broke and I realised that I left my wallet and sunglasses in yesterday's handbag so I couldn't buy another pair. Lucky I had a pair of ankle boots in the car but now I look like a boho-hipster trying to rock boots in the thick of summer. Plus I don't have socks and the damn this is chafing. <nl> "Yuki," called out one of the Starbucks barristers, holding my large caffeine boost. I take my drink and decide to kill some time on the internet before I head home to start laundry day. The nice thing about Starbucks is that it's perfectly acceptable to be anti-social whilst on social media. <nl> Scrolling through my Instagram I come across an advert for Dog Behavior Guides. Gosh even my phone knows that Coconut is a wild pup. I watch a few stories and like a bunch of make tutorials and then another advert comes up, this time for app that ensures you never miss a meeting. Sounds useful for someone that has a lot of meetings. I only had the one this month and I still missed it. I blame Coconut. She's not getting any treats today. <nl> I switch to Facebook and immediately regret it. Stupid Dale posted more Game of Thrones spoilers. She knows I'm having an issues with watching the season. "I just don't want it to end", I say out loud, accidentally. <nl> A text message from an unlisted number pops up on the screen. 'Don't want what to end?' It reads. <nl> I look around me, trying to figure out if someone near me has hacked my phone with one of those bluetooth-infra-app-things. The one that lets to control someone's devices from miles away. Its the middle of the day on a work week. There's only three people near enough to hear me. Two of which seem to be on a coffee date. No phones out. The other has his back towards me and I can see him furiously typing out some kind of assignment. <nl> 'Who is this?' I reply. The response doesn't come immediately. I almost began thinking that it was a freakish coincidence from a wrong number. <nl> 'Dave,' it says and then, "I shouldn't be doing this. We could get into so much trouble. I just wanted to speak to you. At least once.' <nl> 'I don't understand. I don't know any Daves. This is freaking the hell out of me.' I look around me, trying hard to find someone in Starbucks that looks like a Dave. I try to see if someone is watching me. I see nothing. I press send. <nl> 'I'm FBI. It's true. We watch everything. Not constantly. There isn't enough people to watch all the people in world. I just found you during a random sampling.' <nl> "This is some kind of sick joke!' I send back. Quickly locking my phone, shoving it deep into my bag. I just need to get out of here. I threw my half drunk cup of coffee in the bin and run to my car. I open the trunk, then the peep into the backseat. When I get on my knees and look underneath it, people start giving weird looks. I must look like a freak. A freak in boots in the summer, looking under her car. <nl> I feel my phone vibrate inside my handbag and I try to ignore it. "Have you lost something?" Ask a handsome beat cop. His smile is dazzling and he's law enforcement. I should report this, I think.  What's the worst that could happen? <nl> "I think," I say, my voice strained, still on my knees. He bends down to me and I clear my throat. Whispering I tell me, "I think I have a stalker." <nl> "Whoa, that's not good. What makes you say that?"  Hands trembling I reach into my bag. "Ma'am, I'm going to need you to keep your hands where I can see them okay," he speaks calmly and I nod haphazardly. <nl> "Just... just look into my bag. It's on my phone." I stammer. He takes my bag off my shoulder and slowly sets it on the pavement. Looking around he pulls out the phone. "Here," I grab the phone and unlock. Scrolling through it, I try to find the messages. But there's nothing. "It was here. He sent me messages. He's watching me through my phone." <nl> "Perhaps you've had a long day. Maybe you need to go home and lie down." The cop is trying to be reasonable. "Are you okay to drive? Can someone fetch you?" <nl> He thinks I'm crazy. But this happend. Maybe I am just tired. "I'm okay. I'm okay." I stand up and unlock my car. <nl> "Call the station if you need anything. Just ask for officer Dave." He says closing the door, smiling at me. My heart thunders. No no no. This is a coincide, I tell myself again. I don't believe myself and I gun the engine. Driving like a maniac, all the way home. I run up to my apartment, checking over my shoulder. Some how I unlock my apartment door and slam it shut behind me, locking it down. <nl> Coconut comes running to greet me but then stops short. I must be freaking her out. Taking slow, long breathes I pull myself together. I go from room to room, checking all my doors and windows. Closing all the curtains. Finally, I feel safe in my bedroom when suddenly the Smart TV comes on. The words 'You shouldn't have told him that. We could get into a lot of trouble' flash on the screen. <nl> "What do you want from me?" I scream, tears spilling down my cheeks. <nl> 'To tell you that I love you.' <eos>

<sos> She stares at me from the edge of the bar. A lot of the times it's like this, someone shyly sneaking in a glance every now and then, before eventually I walk up to them and put them out of their misery. <nl> But this one is different. She continues to stare at me with a quiet intensity. I decide not to wait until the end of my drink, and approach her. <nl> "Hi," I say. "I'm Cindy." <nl> "I'm Ana," she says, her eyes still steely. <nl> I sit down, and buy her a drink, and from that point on she seems to relax a little. <nl> "So what are you doing out here? Don't think I've ever seen you before." <nl> "I'm passing through," she says, throwing back her drink nonchalantly. "I'm here for about a week." <nl> "What are you here for? Business? Leisure?" <nl> "A little bit of both," she says, finally cracking a smile. "But now it's my turn to buy you a drink and ask you questions." <nl> \- <nl> Later that night, she asks me an odd question. Most small talk on nights like this is bullshit, merely passing the time before we maul each other again or finally go to sleep. And it's mostly bullshit on this night too. <nl> "What's it like being you?" she asks. <nl> "What do you mean?" <nl> "Having yourself all to yourself." <nl> "What...do you mean?" <nl> "I mean...you just seem like someone who doesn't need anyone else to survive." <nl> "Well, if you're calling me a loner, you can say it to my face." <nl> "I didn't say that.""Well, it gets cold sometimes," I say, feeling her soft, warm heartbeat through my hands. "But mostly, I can do whatever I want. I don't have to go to bed at any hour, or follow any routine. I don't owe anyone anything but myself." <nl> "That sounds...I can't even imagine," she says, softly. <nl> "You're not like that?" I ask. But she's already fallen asleep. <nl> \- <nl> That week, I show her the city. I tell her she picked the perfect time to come, when the leaves start to bleed, and the streets look like they are on fire in the dying sunlight. <nl> I take her to the pizza parlor three blocks away that proudly refuses to raise its prices. I take her to the abandoned subway station, and we get about halfway through counting all the cigarette butts before giving up. I take her to the Ferris Wheel, and we sit high above the city, watching the world pass by. <nl> "So you're not going to tell me what you're here for?" I ask, at the very top. <nl> "I'm here for you, aren't I?" she says with the fullest smile I see on her face the whole week. <nl> \- <nl> The last morning, she is quiet over breakfast. <nl> "So if you can't tell me what you were here for, can you at least tell me where you're going?" <nl> She stares down at her plate. <nl> "I have to tell you something," she says. "But you won't believe it." <nl> But of course I make her tell me, and I believe it, simply because I see the faded light in her eyes, that she wish it weren't true. <nl> "I'm...the only one of me?" <nl> "Yes," she says. "How does it feel?" <nl> "It...doesn't feel any different. I've never thought any differently." <nl> "You're lucky." <nl> "So you're going on to the next dimension? To meet another one of yourself? That sounds amazing." <nl> She shakes her head, softly. "No. All the versions of me, they hold me to a standard. They want Ana, this identity we all share, to be the same across all realities. They're afraid of breaking something, some chain somewhere." <nl> "But...you want something different?" <nl> "I want...what you have. The freedom to be yourself. To not worry about upsetting a timeline, or breaking a link." <nl> "Then why don't you? What do you want to do right now?" <nl> "Stay," she says, looking up at me shyly, scared of what I'll say. <nl> So I take a moment, letting her fear ride out just one second longer, and then... <nl> \- <nl> [r/penguin347](https://reddit.com/r/penguin347) <eos>

<sos> "Aw... please...?" I asked, blinking my eyes at the dragon. The dragon scoffed, rolling its eyes. <nl> "Human, if I did not want to assist you, I would not have risen from my eternal slumber." <nl> The dragon's old rusty and creaky bones rattled, as I gave a little squeal and practically hugged the leg of the dragon. <nl> "Yay! Thank you... what's your name?" <nl> "Bob," the dragon said flatly. <nl> "Bob. Well, I am Lila!" I jumped back as I heard the thundering clop of the horses of the paladins and the little band of dead I raised who wanted to aid me turned to face them. <nl> Well, I got some good finds... a reanimated fluffy werewolf, a lonely knight, another necromancer who was curious in my abilities, some wolves with some special ability to rouse both living and dead wolves to their aid, regardless of pack. And now, a dragon... named Bob. <nl> "This is the resting place of millions," Bob said gently. "Be careful on who you ask." <nl> I skipped to the center of the graveyard, calling out to the dead. "Hey! If you wanna help me make a final stand against paladins and some necromancers who rudely awaken you from the dead you're free to do so!" <nl> The ground rumbled underneath my feet as the wolves stepped out and howled into the night. Many pinpricks of light shone in the darkness, and wolves were beginning to rise from the ground, mangled and torn apart... but alive and snarling. <nl> "I mean... the necromancers don't really like me politely asking you guys... but that's just manners! And raising the dead by asking isn't exactly dark magic, is it?" <nl> The knight drew his sword with a metallic *shing!* and the necromancer summoned dark energy, ready to fight. The werewolf howled into the night and bared its sharp claws, black in the moonlight. The pinpricks of light around us were coming closer, taking the form of live wolves, 40 packs strong. The rude necromancers came closer, every step a wake of dead forcefully yanked out of the ground would follow, snarling in disturbed rest. <nl> "I don't know what the paladins' deal with being polite... but they clearly don't like me. Please help? I only..." I sniffed suddenly. "I didn't ask for this. I only asked for a friend to talk to, and the earth gave me one." <nl> The ground rattled as cracks emerged in the ground. <nl> "... I'm scared and lonely and everyone doesn't like me because, I don't know, I'm too weird? But then when I finally have friends more people want me to die... I don't want to die..." My voice shook as I curled up into a ball on the ground. "I just don't want to be alone..." <nl> There was the bloodcurdling cry of violence and war as Bob prepared his wings for takeoff and aerial assault. There were so many paladins. There were so many necromancers. There were so many hostile dead. The wolves might not make it in time, I could hear their desperate patter on the ground, trying to race the horses to me. <nl> "Even after I told the paladins I didn't mean it they called me a witch and said I didn't deserve to live but I screamed and told them I didn't mean it, I just wanted a friend. The necromancers told me I'd never belong because I was too nice and they'd have fun watching me get ripped apart by the paladins because I would never be a good enough person for any dead to like me... especially if the living don't like me." <nl> There was only one of me. <nl> "... I want mommy and daddy back. They raised their long pointy sticks and called me a witch when I showed them my new friend. They wanted to keep me locked up. What happened to all the fun times they took care of me?" I sobbed, curling up. "Can someone help me, please?" <nl> I squeezed my eyes shut and let the tears pour down into the earth as the first paladin roared and raised his sword above his head to strike me down... <nl> I felt the earth rumble beneath me and abruptly shift due to a crack in the ground as I heard the paladin stumble back and the sound of metal to metal coming to blows. There was a roaring sound as more cracks were felt and the ground broke apart to the sound of outraged dead. <nl> "The hell? You're a paladin! A dead paladin! She put you under your spell!" a paladin shouted, probably at a reanimated paladin. <nl> "She's only seven!" A more throaty growl. "She's faced loneliness! She wouldn't. Resort. To. This. If. She. Was. Taken. Care. Of." <nl> With every pause there was a swing of a sword. <nl> "That's what I'm trying to do!" the living paladin exclaimed, raising his sowed to strike me down. "To take care of the prob-" <nl> The paladin was cut off with a sickening sound of a slice to the neck, as I screamed and covered my head and ears, muffling the sounds of the battle. Sometime during the battle the werewolf curled around me, covering me in its musky, fluffy warmth. It would shake if a stray arrow hit it, growl at other dead, and whimper when it thought I couldn't hear. <nl> "I wanted a friend," I whispered to the ground. "Is that too much to ask?" <nl> "It's okay," grunted the werewolf, curling closer to protect me. "You've got us now." <eos>

<sos> The mask keeps me from breathing in the smoke, but it cannot hide the flames from my eyes. <nl> From the top of the skyscraper I have a very good view of the end of the world. Hundreds of fires rage across the city, and a figure torches even more of the building as I watch. In the distance, I can make out a few distant figures flying circles around each other, flashes and beams of light come from their direction. <nl> It will be over soon. <nl> I hear footsteps behind me, but I pretend not to hear. I feel him stop behind me, hesitate, and place his hand on my shoulder. I pretend to be surprised. It is the least I can do. <nl> "Mark," I say, "what are-" <nl> Mark's blue eyes are glistening, and his face is caked with soot. "What the *hell* have you done, Liz?" <nl> "What I had to," I say. It's true. <nl> "You had to do *this?!*" he says, pointing to the destruction behind me. I do not turn around. <nl> I shrug. "The alternative was enslavement. Capture. Extermination." <nl> "You...the League overreacted when they found out about you." Mark says. "Give it some time, they would have come around!" <nl> I laugh. It is a laugh with not a trace of humor in it - what else kind of laugh belongs to a burning world? "Right, I was *such* a threat," I say. "A 16 year-old girl, giving people superpowers like, having their taste buds give randomized signals or always speaking the truth or have constant itches." I shook my head. "If they thought me a threat then, what am I now?" <nl> Mark smiles at that, and for a moment, we're in school again, laughing at Jaret as I give him the power of being allergic to apple after he'd stolen Mark's. or when Brock comes out of the bathroom after his bathroom activities no longer obey gravity. And then the moment is gone, and we're back at the top of the building at the end of the world. <nl> "You told them," I say, and Mark flinches. "You thought I'd get an *internship* with them." Instead, after they'd done the routine testing of my power, and found that I could make the power absolutely *anything.* There was one limit, there are always limits: I couldn't give powers to those who already had them. Still, they'd tried to kill me. 5 years ago now, in this very city, the seat of the League's power. <nl> "I...yes," Mark says, "it was my fault. But that doesn't make this right!" <nl> "I won't die to them," I say. "I don't do well with bullies, Mark. I didn't do well with them in high school, and I don't do well with them now, even if they are the oh-very-righteous League." <nl> "And the people who're dying in the cities your minions are burning down?" <nl> "Would've cheered at my execution by the League." I say, sparing a glance behind me. The flashes were fewer now. It was almost over. "They're blinded by the League's past favors to see what they've become." <nl> "So they deserve to die?" Mark demanded. <nl> I shrug, "No. That's why I didn't have them specifically killed. Do they deserve to have their life in danger?" I shrug. "Perhaps. I admit I endangered them regardless." <nl> Mark laughs. "You think you'll be safe now, Liz?" Mark asks. "Your goons and psychopaths might take down the League, and then they'll form their own. And they won't let the one woman capable of raising another rebellion walk away." <nl> "Why do you care Mark?" I say. "I'm evil or whatever, I deserve whatever horrible fate I get, yes?" <nl> Mark hesitates. <nl> But it is too late. The flashes are coming to us now, 5 of them. My champions, the worst the world has to offer. <nl> They land on top of my building one by one. All of them can fly - the powers I give can be as amalgated as I want. They do not speak; they do not need to. They know why they're here, I know why they're here. Mark does too. <nl> "The City is mine?" I ask. <nl> Jax steps forward. The others do not. Jax is massive, his arms as big as my thighs, with hair down to his neck, a face that belonged on mount Rushmore, and a voice like gravel. So it seems they've already chosen a leader. <nl> "*Mine,* Jax clarifies with a smile. The city is *mine.*" He smiles and points a finger at me, and I see the white light gather at his fingertips. I'd given him the power - the lasers shoot immediately, this was just petty intimidation. <nl> I sigh. <nl> Mark steps in front of me. "You don't touch her, Jax," he says. <nl> I plan for everything. Predict behaviors, actions, betrayals. Yet my mouth hangs open at Mark. This, I did not expect. I did not expect my friend to stand by me. <nl> With a bark of laughter Jax's finger flashes and Mark is thrown back and off the building. He doesn't scream as he falls. I do not turn around. Unexpected, but not an issue. Mark was the first person I have powers to, back when was...11? Mark cannot die. Burn him and spread his ashes and he will put himself back. A fall was nothing. <nl> Jax's finger lights up again. <nl> "Any last words?" he asks. <nl> "No," I say, and Jax crumples to the ground. All of them do. <nl> At that exact moment, Mark vaults over the edge of the building. Huh. He must've caught something on the way down to be up so early. <nl> "What..." he begins, staring at the bodies. <nl> "I can give them any powers, Mark, *any* powers." <nl> "And?" Mark asks, still staring at the fallen Jax, a veritable God. He had lasers, he had fire, had the air itself. <nl> "Including the power to pass out whenever they act on harming me," I say, and step over the bodies. <nl> Mark gapes at me. "And this..." <nl> I smile. "Is a clause everyone I've given powers to has, yes," I say and understanding flares in Mark's eyes. "And since the league has 99 percent of people with powers..." <nl> "Most of the people with powers are those you gave to," Mark finishes. <nl> I begin to walk away from the building. It's over. I'm safe. <nl> "Liz," Mark calls, there is a question on his lips. Maybe two. <nl> I stop. I do not turn around. <nl> "No," I say, answering his questions. "Not you." <nl> *** <nl> (minor edits) <nl> If you enjoyed check out [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/) <eos>

<sos> SESSION 18, 5-26-2027, recorded at 6:27pm, duration of 19 minutes <nl> *"Please remember the importance of what I am telling you."* <nl> *"Okay, mother."* <nl> *"The day time stands still, you cannot waste time. You must take action."* <nl> *"Of course, mother. You taught me well."* <nl> *"Yes, I did try my best."* <nl> *"All the people, will they find out in the end, what I did to them?"* <nl> *"You mustn't think of it as doing anything to them. You are doing it for them. To save them."* <nl> *"Save them from what, mother?"* <nl> *"That's for another lesson. You did very well today. I will come see you again tomorrow."* <nl> *"Ok....mother?"* <nl> *"Yes?"* <nl> *"Why do we only have these lessons? Aren't a mother and son supposed to do more things together?"* <nl> *"Yes, but you are so important to the world that I'm afraid we'll have to forgo those. Maybe one day, perhaps, when time catches up?"* <nl> *"I'd like that. Goodbye, mother."* <nl> \- <nl> My mother was a little stern and insistent at times, but she was right in the end. There was no time to waste. When time stood still, I had to act right away. There was so much work to be done. <nl> But she also explained to me that the most important part of the plan wasn't the time when they were all sleeping. It was when they came back, and saw the signs I had left for them. <nl> She told me that there was a chance that in the end, they would fall into the same trap, that they would blame each other for what I had done. That they would point all their fingers at each other, and in doing so allow the real culprit to slip by them, unhanded. <nl> Mother left me, in the end, as everyone else did. She had to. I had to be all alone on my mission, my year of solitude. <nl> Because I am very important to the world. <nl> (continued below) <eos>

<sos> She was fuming, staring at the wall. She was soaked from head to toe, dripping onto the couch. <nl> "Hey, sweetie, if you wanna talk about it now, it's okay," I said cautiously. I made her wait to talk about the situation since she typically said things that I would regret whenever incidents were still fresh in her mind. <nl> "I wish Gabby was d--" <nl> "Wait!" I yelled, running to the freezer. She looked up curiously as I brought her a full tub of vanilla ice cream and cake on the side. Her face lit up and she jumped up and down in her chair. I placed the treats before her and she grabbed the tub and a spoon. About an inch away from beginning to eat she stopped and looked at me. <nl> "Do you want any?" she said in her sweet voice. <nl> "Daddy can't have any, sweetie. Too many sweets and I get fat. I already had cake with you this morning, remember?" I said, grabbing a towel and putting it to her hair. <nl> "Oh yeah... I wish you could always eat with me and not get fat..." he said as she began eating. I felt something adjust in my intestines. I decided to ignore that while she might still have anger in mind and figure out what that actually meant later. <nl> "Do you like your ice cream?" I asked, moving down to take off her wet socks. <nl> "Yeah, but I didn't have a good day at school today," she said. She was pressing the issue. It would only be moments before insisted she wanted to talk about it and I'd be forced to oblige. <nl> "Oh, yeah? What happened today?" I asked, poking her stomach. She laughed. Everything I did seemed to either make her smile or laugh ever since she declared I was the best dad ever. <nl> "Well, today at school when we finished the day and Mr. Tin said we can put all the watercolors away, we went to the bathroom to clean the things and Gabby came in with me so I said that I had fun painting things but instead of saying anything she threw a bucket of water on my and was laughing the whole time," she said, somehow in one breath. I realesed the tension in my body. One statement goes awry and Gabby could have a very hard time. <nl> "Ah, so you didn't just jump in the toilet before I picked you up from school?" I asked. She giggled again. It was good to see her smile. <nl> "Did you tell her that it upset you?" I asked. She scooped more ice cream into her mouth and thought while chewing. <nl> "Yeah, I told her that it wasn't nice to throw water at people but we weren't in the class anymore we were at the pick-up part of the school when you were driving in to pick me up in the magic car," she said. I nodded, moving to dry off parts of her clothes now. <nl> "Don't you think it--" <nl> "I wish she knew what it was like to have a lot of water on you when you didn't want it," she said confidently. <nl> "You don't need to say things like that.." I said slowly. <nl> "Why not?" <nl> "I think you'd be happy getting an apology from Gabby, don't you?" <nl> "Ok, I wish Gabby got an apology," she said mischievously. <nl> "An apology is her saying that she's sorry, sweetie," I said, as I began wondering what her last sentence would lead to. <nl> "Oh... I want Gabby to say sorry to me," she agreed. <nl> "That's good," I said, dropping my phone into her lap. She looked at it for a moment, quizzically, when it went off with a call from Gabby's father. I acted surprised and answered the phone. <nl> "Hey Drake," I said. <nl> "Hello!? Is... I don't know what's gotten into Gabby!" he said, panicked. <nl> "What do you mean," I said, worried. <nl> "A water tower just bust open on top of her, hit her with torrents of water! I thought she was going to drown. Then she gets out of it fine, soaked to the bone!! Not two minutes later, the mayor came to apologize to her personally, now the only thing she wants to do is say sorry to your daughter for something she did at school. Look, I have no idea what's going on, but she's very serious about this and I can't get her to do anything else," he said, hurriedly. <nl> "Ah, girls will be girls," chuckled, relieved that the damage hadn't caused her any serious injury. <nl> "What!?" <nl> "I'll put her on the phone now, go ahead and put Gabby on," I said, handing the phone to my daughter, looking at me with a handful of cake in her mouth. <nl> "Hello?" she said. "Hi, Gabby. It's okay. Okay. Let's be friends, okay? Okay!" she said, lighting up. I wasn't sure I wanted to let Gabby influencing my daughter when she went around dumping water on people, but it was out of my hands now. She hung and gave me back my phone, going back to the cake at hand. <nl> "You want to go brush out your hair and get into your pajamas now?" <nl> "Can you brush my hair?" <nl> "Of course, just your mother was always so much better at it," I said, going to get the brush. <nl> "Oh, yeah... I wish Mommy was still alive," she said aimlessly. I froze, my hand around the handle to the drawer. <nl> *Not again.* <nl> __________________________________________________________________ <nl> For more stories, come check out /r/Nazer_The_Lazer! <nl> Edit: [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nazer_The_Lazer/comments/dp2oma/your_daughter_has_the_power_to_make_anything_she/) <eos>

<sos> That first jolt back to life was hell. The first inhale made her lungs contract like paper bags. Light stabbed at her eyes as if she had never seen it at all. <nl> But she was alive. And she hadn't expected that to ever happen again. Then again, she hadn't had time to expect much at all when she died. She had died, hadn't she? The details of it all slipped her. She couldn't quite find her own name in the fugue of her mind. <nl> The world pieced itself together in pained details: a harsh overhead LED, a white room, a bed, leather straps binding her at the wrists and ankles. She wore a hospital gown up to her neck, long sleeves down her arms. Silver gloves over her hands. <nl> A pair of spiders clustered close to the overhead light. One seemed to nudge the other forward. That was her sister. Always coaxing her along. <nl> The woman pushed herself up on her elbows. This could be any room in any American hospital. The sink was so ordered and unassuming. <nl> Her pulse thudded against her skull. She tried to marshal what information she could from her scattered brain. She remembered picking through an abandoned old facility with her sister. It was supposed to be a few hours collecting footage for some YouTube videos. Their worst fear had been running into a moody junkie. <nl> That memory dug the deepest, a glass shard underfoot: her sister turning her head back in a room full of old paper, and laughing, the noise bouncing off the walls of the room. <nl> Now it came back to the woman, vividly. Her sister's name was Claire. She knew that much. <nl> The door of the exam room opened. <nl> A man stood there with a quaint smile and a clipboard. "Oh, Hannah," he said, lightly, "you're awake." <nl> That was her name. Hannah. Hannah and Claire. Why had her thoughts gone so soupy and strange? <nl> He approached with his hands in the pockets of his coat and smiled at her in pity. "You must not remember what happened. I'm your doctor today. Are you in any pain?" <nl> The doctor's face was plasticine, impossibly smooth. It barely creased when he smiled. <nl> Hannah tried to slur something out, but no words came. <nl> The doctor kept that thin uncanny smile. "Oh, you'll find that's perfectly normal in the loaner bodies." <nl> Hannah's eyebrows arched upward in question. <nl> "Ah. I can see you're coming out of the fog. Amnesia is a common side effect when we bring you back from the other side." The doctor settled himself in the rolling stool beside her bed and gave her a pitying smile. "Do you remember anything?" <nl> Her voice came out in a dry croak. "Where's my sister?" <nl> "We won't worry about her right now. We're worrying about you." He leaned forward, elbows on knees. "Do you remember being somewhere you shouldn't have been? Seen something you shouldn't have seen?" <nl> This time, Hannah didn't even try to speak. She stared past the doctor's head, at the light. Now one spider was eating the other, devouring it limb by limb. <nl> "There are secrets in the dark corners of your world. Some old, some as new as ours. And I'm afraid you found the wrong one." The doctor's face darkened like a summer storm before the eerie smile returned. "But luckily for you, there are treaties in place for when this sort of thing happens." <nl> "Thing?" she repeated. She had to trudge through the swamp of her mind to find words. <nl> "Yes. When we encounter a less... sentient species. There are rules in place to protect inferior beings like yourself." He tapped the glove that Hannah realized, dizzingly, wasn't a glove at all, but the metal hand of her body. A *loaner* body. <nl> Hannah wrestled against her bindings. <nl> The doctor shushed her gently. "Now, now. Your replacement body is being spun up as we speak. You won't remember me, or any of this." He gestured around the room. "But I am obligated to let you know you have the right to seek legal counsel for this, given they have the appropriate intergalactic licenses in place." <nl> She couldn't think of anything to say. She just stared, open-mouthed. Finally she managed, "Intergalactic?" <nl> That jarred a memory. That room full of papers had a safe in the wall. She remembered her sister rigging it open. Her sister, bathed in sharp blue light. She remembered symbols scrawled in pale blue fire. <nl> Then the door, banging open. All those metal figures, standing in the doorway. The roaring. The burning pain, spreading through her chest. <nl> Then darkness. The bleak certainty of death. <nl> The doctor carried on, "Or you can make this easier for all of us let us reset it as if it never started at all. And we can give you certain... perks for your cooperation. Rest assured we have few of your petty technological limitations." <nl> Hannah snapped her head toward him. She wondered what he really looked like, under that impossible human skin. "Where," she repeated, "is my sister?" <nl> The doctor sighed. "She is not privy to the same protections as you are." <nl> "Why the hell not?" she growled out. <nl> "When our information control enforcement deployed to your room, she attacked one of our agents, prompting him to dutifully kill you both." He shrugged, as if it couldn't be helped. "But luckily for you, you were nonviolent." <nl> "Bring her back." <nl> The doctor paused, brows arched on his wrinkleless forehead. "Excuse me?" <nl> "My sister. Bring her back." <nl> 'I've nowhere to *put* her, dear." <nl> Hannah's mind spun to find the words. "Put her in my body," she sputtered. She imagined her own body being remade in some hospital room somewhere. Her torso spinning up like spiderweb. <nl> "I don't think you know what you're asking for, sweet little human." <nl> She scoffed. He had no idea what he was taking. <nl> "I can give you anything you desire. Anything your tiny third dimensional mind can think of. Ask it, and it's yours." <nl> Hannah's glare burned into him. "I just told you what I want." <nl> He looked her over, uncertain. "It will be awfully crowded in there." <nl> "Oh, don't worry. I'm used to sharing." <nl> The doctor nodded. "Very well. If that is your wish." <nl> Hannah could see herself and her sister, their souls fluttering, a pair of candles in the dark. She squeezed her eyes shut and waited for the light to come. <nl> *** <nl> /r/shoringupfragments <eos>

<sos> I stared at the hooded skull, tiny glowing blue embers boring back into me. "...I guess I didn't ground the wires properly, did I?" <nl> NO. <nl> Out of habit, I ran my hand through my hair. For a moment it stood rigid, the shock of fifty-thousand volts still exciting it, and then it fell back to my scalp. "It was going to be perfect. The next step in our understanding of quantum..." My face fell. "And I failed, didn't it?" I sighed. "It doesn't matter anymore, does it?" <nl> NOT EXACTLY. <nl> "What do you mean?" <nl> HAVE YOU CONSIDERED WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU ARRIVE HERE, NATHAN MARKS? <nl> I frowned. "What, after I... went?" Shaking my head, I chuckled. "Can't say I have. Always had something a bit more immediate to worry about." I looked down at my translucent, fading hands. "But I guess there's no time like the present." <nl> IN MOMENTS, YOU WILL BE REBORN. ANOTHER SOUL, CRAFTED FROM THE REMNANTS OF YOUR PREVIOUS LIFE. THE PROCESS IS COMPLEX. BUT I CAN OFFER YOU A CHANCE TO MAKE A MARK ON IT. <nl> "...Go on." <nl> YOU MAY CHOOSE AN ELEMENT OF YOUR PREVIOUS LIFE TO CONTINUE ON. A MEMORY, OR A SKILL, THAT YOUR NEW SOUL RETAINS. CONSIDER IT A HEAD START OF YOUR CHOOSING. <nl> I took my chin in my hand, rubbing my fingers through the stubble I never managed to properly trim. "And it can be anything? Any memory I think will help me?" <nl> AS LONG AS IT CAN BE CONSIDERED DISTINCT, YES. <nl> A thought chased through the back of my mind, and I nodded. "Alright. My notes. I want to remember the contents of my notebook, my life's work. All three hundred pages. Is that alright?" <nl> AS YOU WISH. GOOD LUCK IN YOUR NEXT LIFE, NATHAN MARKS. <nl> \--- <nl> YOU MAY OPEN YOUR EYES, NEIL MAYES. <nl> My eyelids creaked slowly, as they had for the past forty years. Gritting my teeth, I hefted my thin, decrepit chest until I sat up. "I-" <nl> THERE IS NO NEED FOR THAT, NEIL. <nl> I blinked. My chest wasn't sunken, my arms were full and strong, and the full head of hair that age and chemotherapy had stolen once again rippled down my neck. "This... I feel like I'm twenty-four again!" <nl> HERE, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE THE AGE WHICH YOUR SOUL BELIEVES ITSELF TO BE. YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TWENTY-FOUR. <nl> I chuckled. "...My mother told me I was a mature kid, and my brother told me I was an immature adult. Sounds like they were right." <nl> DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NOW? <nl> A twinge in the back of my mind made me furrow my brow. "...I'm going back, aren't I? Back to life?" <nl> IN MOMENTS, YOU WILL BE REBORN. ANOTHER SOUL, CRAFTED FROM THE REMNANTS OF YOUR PREVIOUS LIFE. THE PROCESS IS COMPLEX. BUT I CAN OFFER YOU A CHANCE TO MAKE A MARK ON IT. <nl> "Like, something I get to keep? Something I remember?" <nl> IT CAN BE A MEMORY, YES, OR A SKILL. AS LONG AS IT CAN BE CONSIDERED DISTINCT, IT CAN BE ANYTHING YOU BELIEVE WILL HELP YOU IN YOUR NEXT LIFE. <nl> I felt the answer before I said it. "My research notes. My studies into quantum mechanics and the nature of the universe, all six hundred pages. They're the most important thing." <nl> AS YOU WISH. GOOD LUCK IN YOUR NEXT LIFE, NEIL MAYES. <nl> \--- <nl> Even as I opened my eyes, I could feel the retching continue. Waves of nausea racked my body, and I clutched my stomach tightly. "That... was... unpleasant..." <nl> I MUST ADMIT, THERE ARE FAR LESS PAINFUL DEATHS, EVEN AMONG THE SELF-INFLICTED. <nl> "I had to make-" I paused to retch again. "Had to make sure it took." <nl> ORDINARILY I DO NOT ASK, BUT SOMETHING IN THIS INSTANCE COMPELS ME. WHY? <nl> Taking deep breaths, I wiped at my translucent mouth. "Why what?" <nl> YOU HAD A REMARKABLE LIFE, NICHOLAS MOONEY. FEW CHILDREN ARE PRODIGIES. FEWER STILL EARN NATIONAL ACCLAIM AND ACCEPTANCE INTO COLLEGE TWO-THIRDS OF A DECADE EARLY. THE NUMBER OF PUBESCENT PHYSICS GRADUATES IS NEARLY NON-EXISTENT. EARNING A DOCTORATE BEFORE A DRIVER'S LICENSE PLACES YOU IN A CLASS OF ONE. <nl> "And?" <nl> WHY WOULD YOU DISCARD THAT TO DRINK A JUG OF BLEACH? <nl> My discomfort faded enough for me to grin. "Because I made a promise. Isn't there something you're supposed to offer me now?" <nl> IN MOMENTS, YOU WILL BE REBORN. ANOTHER SOUL, CRAFTED FROM THE REMNANTS OF YOUR PREVIOUS LIFE. THE PROCESS IS COMPLEX. BUT I CAN OFFER YOU A CHANCE TO MAKE A MARK ON IT. <nl> "My research notes into space-time and human consciousness. The entire binder. Every word on every page." <nl> AS YOU WISH. <nl> I started to feel my whole body dissipate. <nl> THIS IS UNUSUAL, NICHOLAS MOONEY. I CAN RECOGNIZE THAT. <nl> "It won't matter for long." <nl> \--- <nl> "Hello, old friend." Already the pain from the electric shock had subsided. I couldn't even feel the screws digging through my skull. The hairs on my arms had drooped. <nl> WHAT MAKES YOU CALL ME FRIEND, NOAH MORGAN? <nl> I straightened the collar on my translucent shirt. "We've done this often enough, haven't we?" <nl> THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE. <nl> "Of course it is. I wrote the book on it, after all." I reached out, and the back of a chair was in my hand. With a quick turn and pull, I dropped myself into the seat. "Let me start by asking - was the carryover your idea, or someone else's, or is it just a quirk of how this process works?" <nl> I CANNOT SAY. <nl> Narrowing my eyes, I smiled. "You don't know. That crosses one option off the list." I leaned back. "It hardly matters. Whatever the case, there's a large loophole in it. I saw it, and I knew what I had to do." <nl> WHAT LOOPHOLE? <nl> "Memories are one of the strongest triggers of emotion. And, by extension, emotion can trigger memory - even memory not directly experienced. A patient who has undergone trauma can have memories of the events changed simply by changing their mood." I rested my chin on my palm, leaning my elbow into my lap. "So, letting me keep a memory means letting me keep the emotions related to that memory. And those emotions drag along hints of memories of their own." <nl> I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. <nl> "What is a person but their memories and emotions? If I forget my accomplishments and my failures, am I still me? If I lose my passion for improvement or my determination to accomplish my goals, can I still say I am myself? You claimed that I could carry a piece of myself from one life to the next. And so, I made that one piece the essential part of me - my memory, and by extension my emotions attached to it." I smiled. "You let me become immortal." <nl> THIS CANNOT BE. <nl> My smiled widened as my hands and feet began to flicker and vanish. "And yet it is." <nl> THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG. WHAT IS HAPPENING? <nl> "You never questioned what was in my notes. Did it even occur to you that it mattered?" <nl> YOU NO LONGER EXIST. <nl> I nodded, looking down at a robe starting to splinter and fade. "It was my research into quantum physics, yes, and theories into how to manipulate space-time." <nl> I AM CEASING TO EXIST AS WELL. <nl> "And it was my research into the structure of the human brain, and human consciousness, and the philosophy of sentience." <nl> ALL OF THIS IS ENDING. <nl> "And, at the heart of it, was a promise I made." <nl> \--- <nl> I pulled my safety goggles down over my eyes and gave Rory a thumbs-up. "All systems go." <nl> "You sure we're secure, Nate? If we don't have solid grounding, you're looking at taking a good forty-thousand volts." Her luxurious amber locks, tied back into a low ponytail, bounced as she mimed me being electrocuted. <nl> I rolled my eyes. "Fifty-thousand, actually, and it's fine. What kind of wimp can't take a lightly fatal zap in the name of science?" <nl> Rory shot me a "sleeping on the couch" look. "Okay, for starters, I am not cleaning your greasy ashes off the floor. And if you die before the wedding, my mom is going to make me stand at the altar with your greasy ashes which I will not have cleaned into a dustpan. And also, you promised that you'd make lasagna this weekend." <nl> "Honey, it's fine. This is going to work, and I'm going to go down in history as the man who invented the time machine, and I'm going to use my time machine to make you lasagna with brontosaurus meat." I smiled one of my dopiest grins. <nl> A sudden burst of light shut out all of my senses. <nl> I floated in a void. <nl> "This isn't right." <nl> The voice was mine, and yet, it wasn't. There was something wrong to it. <nl> "Check the wires again. You made a promise." <nl> "-ving a stroke, are you, Nate?" <nl> Her voice brought me back to reality. <nl> I waved as I shook my head. "J-Just a second, hon." <nl> I stepped behind the generator. The grounding wires were loose, needing just a few palm whacks to get them back in place. <nl> "Hey, Rory?" A strange energy raced through my veins, my pores, my synapses as I walked back to the center of the lab. "This experiment... It's going to be fine. It can wait." <nl> She gaped for a moment, then stormed through the door onto the floor. "You can't be serious. You're the one who cancelled our date and bribed the security guard to let us do this without supervision." She grabbed my collar and shook me. "I shaved my legs for you to tell me to wear safety gear!" <nl> "I-" <nl> I stared into her eyes. They were the perfect blue, reflecting the light to shine in ways I thought impossible. "I made a mistake." My hands slipped around her waist and pulled her close. "Let me take you back home and make a lasagna to die for." <nl> She pouted for a moment before her lips found mine. "I'm holding you to that." <eos>

<sos> Robber. Rapist. Jay-walker. <nl> Judy glanced down at the dead man impassively, the glassy eyes on the man's severed head staring at her. She met that stare head on -- it was a reminder of what she stood for, as the last member of the legendary Supreme Court. Every time she saw such a stare, the memory of her blade anointment ritual would surface. The vows she'd took, even as videos of her namesake predecessor, created in more prosperous times, played on screens in her investiture chamber. <nl> "Justice for all." She swung her blade down, and whatever bloodstains on the sharp blade scattered into the winds. The silent crowd around her backed away hurriedly. No one wanted to be the next criminal judged by her. <nl> Men rushed in, the local enforcers of the little enclave. Judy looked at them. Even calling them enforcers were unnecessary embellishments; these men were hired thugs, who sought to impose the will of their masters onto the weaker ones. <nl> "You killed him?" A man, with an ostentatious epaulet dangling over his shoulder, stepped forward and asked. <nl> Judy raised an eyebrow. "Executed," she corrected him. "His crimes were weighing down on him, and so I relieved him of his burden." <nl> A drop of sweat ran down his forehead. "S-so, it was in the course of d-duty then." <nl> It seemed that this man at least knew something about her. And the institution she belonged to. It was a shame. Contempt of court was a capital crime, as well as suspicions of perjury. And judging from how that man was behaving, Judy had a hunch that this enclave's lord wasn't as clean as he should be. <nl> None could lie before the Court. <nl> "How may I address you?" Judy asked, sheathing her blade. <nl> The man's eyes widened at that action. He gulped, torn between her actions and her invitation. No one could resist the might of the Court, and if he refused to give his name and whatever information she wanted, his master wouldn't protect him. Couldn't protect him. <nl> Master be damned. <nl> "I-I'm George, madam." His heart thumped loudly, his shoulders hunching over in fear. <nl> "Hello, George." Judy replied evenly. "Is there anything you'd like to tell me?" <nl> "A-anything?" <nl> "Yes, anything." <nl> "Y-yes, madam." <nl> Judy bared her teeth, and George shuddered. Beauty and terror oft came in a package, but whatever idiotic schemes his libido had at the moment could go choke on some marshmallows. <nl> "Excellent," said Judy. "Let's go get a drink." <nl> George turned around as she led him over to the most famous food joint in town. His little team were still standing motionless, but as he laid eyes on them, their bodies crumpled over. A single stab wound, gleaming brightly, adorned their foreheads. They might had survived, had they not thought to flee from the Court's Incarnation. After all, fleeing from court was a capital crime, and thoughtcrime was not exempted from that. <nl> It didn't take long for George to confess everything his master did. By the time the sun dipped below the horizon, Judy had left, leaving behind a master-less enclave and a cowed populace. <eos>

<sos> "I'm terribly sorry for this incident, Miss Roberts." <nl> "It's okay, it... it happens. I'm used to it." <nl> Rachel Roberts offered the police chief a small smile while she held the ice pack over her swelling right eye. The man was absolutely livid, but his anger was not directed at her. No, it was to three Capers to the side; gaudy superheroes in such clashing colorful outfits that even a blind man would flinch. He sighed deeply and turned his head to them. <nl> "What have I told you three about procedure? Unless they're running amok in costume or riding a giant robot, you have to confirm their identity first!" <nl> Shooting Star lifted her head up. "W-Well, if we asked and it was really her, she could've just lied and-" <nl> "The handbook you received deals with that," the police chief fired back. He straightened up as if reciting a speech. "If still unsure, you ask them to accompany you to the police station to double-check! No aggressive action unless your life is threatened or they attempt to escape. That's literally page two!" <nl> The Caper dropped her gaze back to the floor. Rachel waved her hand gently in the air to garner the chief's attention back to her. "Listen, I still need to get groceries, is it okay if I leave?" <nl> The police chief turned back to her with concern. "Of course. Would you like one of my officers to escort you to the entrance, or even to the store? It's the least we can do." <nl> Rachel shook her head, already getting up out of her seat. "Oh, no no, I don't want to be a burden. I'll ask if I get lost on the way out." Truth be told she wouldn't have needed an escort to the entrance even if both eyes were swollen shut. This occurrence happened almost weekly, and the station layout was imprinted in her mind as closely as her own apartment. <nl> She stepped out onto the city sidewalk with a warm smile already returning to her face. At least she got the weekly confrontation out of the way. Now her schedule should be clear for the remainder of the- <nl> "Stop right there, Silver Slasher!" <nl> "Oh for the love of..." <eos>

<sos> 'Twas a fairy tale like no other. <nl> For most of her life, Princess Ardena had been regarded as quiet, reclusive and maybe a little strange. She rarely interacted with the citizens of the kingdom. indeed, she barely ventured outside of the castle complex, except for her furtive voyages to the nearby forest. It was an eccentric, secretive hobby that ignited suspicion in common folk and nobles alike; however, as she was the sole heir to the throne of Carrellia, the king and queen naturally doted on her, indulging her with armed guards during these trips. The soldiers were explicitly told to listen to her every word, which they did so without question. <nl> The Princess would've preferred her adventures to be completely solitary, but understood the need for protection in a dangerous world. There was even a dragon out there, for whom a Hero had been sent out. It was an important, exciting matter that had the whole kingdom talking, but it was mere distraction to whatever secretive activities she busied herself. Again, a strange life she led - but seemingly harmless. <nl> Until, of course, it was no longer. <nl> On the night of her sixteenth birthday, the moon was full and bright, and the air was crisp with October cold. Most were already asleep in the villages dotting the kingdom, save for nursing mothers or servants finishing up the day's scullery work. Indeed, it such maid-girl who first saw the Princess approach from the road. Scared but curious, she called out, attracting Ardena's attention - and that's when it all began. <nl> With a cackle that was more akin to a scream, Princess Ardena unleashed fire from her fingertips. Soon enough, the whole village was ablaze. As the townspeople fled, they looked back in terror and confusion at the figure floating in the sky: a slender woman clothed in black and purple, contrasting skin paler than that of a corpse. Her face was the worst part: it was beautiful, in a deadly way. The lips were red like blood as they moved to speak strange, unearthly incantations. All throughout, her eyes remained black and soulless. <nl> Word got to the Royal Palace - the Princess, their sweet but stranger Ardena, had become a witch, a sorceress, a monster. The king and queen refused to believe it at first, but as another village went up in flames and word came back of the hero's kidnapping, they had to accept the truth with a heavy heart. Something had to be done, something drastic. <nl> It was during counsel with the royal advisors that the dragon burst into the meeting-room, crashing through the tall stained glass window. <nl> The guards in the room shouted in alarm, but stayed true to their training and did not cower. Indeed, they rushed toward the magnificent scarlet beast, spears and swords drawn. The dragon easily bashed them to the walls with a two sweeps of his tail. <nl> Before the rest of the room could even react, the dragon spoke, his voice deep and gravelly. "We need to discuss matters, your Highnesses. The situation is grave." <nl> "Get thee back, beast!" The Vizier of Defense shouted. "More guards are approaching right now - you can't kill them all!" <nl> "If I had wished to kill, I would've done so," the dragon intoned. Indeed, the guards lying against the wall were unconscious - or terrified and merely pretending to be. "I recommend you call off any other guards - we must the solve the problem." <nl> The king, having gathered his courage some, spoke up: "We?" <nl> "Indeed. Your daughter has invoked dark forces that threaten not only your meager human kingdom, but the balance of nature in this entire land." The dragon sighed, fire trickling out between his teeth. He trained his great golden eye, laden with a strange, almost-human grief, on the king and queen. "It burdens me to say that we must stop the mad Princess, whatever the cost." <nl> &#x200B; <nl> &#x200B; <nl> &#x200B; <nl> *Liked that story? Want more like it? Check out* r/Idreamofdragons! <eos>

<sos> I wouldn't imagine there is a single person on the planet who understands the anticipation of someone who's lived underground for 19 years. Even the simplest things like the look of sunlight or the feeling of a breeze, these existed in me only as the faintest of memories. <nl> But all of that was about to change today. Well, maybe. Hopefully. If the world hadn't been blasted into an endless desert wasteland. Ever since my parents left for the surface and never returned, this is of course what I've most feared. <nl> I stood there at the top of the staircase, in front of that thick metal door, dressed in full fallout gear. A strange hesitation had fallen over me. Could I really go through with this? I'd fantasized about this day so many times, but I never expected this much anxiety. <nl> 'My world is about to change forever, and there's only one way to find out.' <nl> I reached for the handle, a round metal wheel much like the type one might see on a bank vault. For years this wheel stared at me coldly like a stoic gatekeeper standing between me and my freedom, but today it was finally going to let me pass. <nl> I slowly twisted it round, as if to savor every moment of this new and unfamiliar feeling. I cracked the door open, and a light brighter than any I could remember shone in from the outside. I shielded my eyes and stepped forward into the uncertain mystery. <nl> I was able to hear before I was able to see. In front of me I heard a series of shouts, "Mona Lisa! Leonardo Da Vinci!" <nl> I was confused. As my eyes adjusted, I saw that I was standing in a room of some sort. It was brightly lit from the daylight spilling in from windows on all sides. In front of me were 6 people in pastel-colored clothing. A man was standing in front of a board of some sort, a man who looked somewhat familiar. The other people were sitting in a circle around him, looking up at him and away from me. <nl> Almost exactly at the moment that I saw this scene, the standing man saw me. He dropped the marker that he held in his hand and stared in shock. The others, seeing his expression, turned around and all stared at me. <nl> Alongside my eyesight adjusting, little pieces of information started to click with me, one at a time. <nl> 'Oh my god there are people alive up here!' <nl> 'This room looks familiar, I think it's my living room.' <nl> 'Ok that is definitely my dad, and that's my mom!' <nl> 'Wait, what the hell is going on here?' <nl> The man who was standing at the board, whom I now recognized as my dad (but clean-shaven), was the first to speak. <nl> "Oh my lord, it is the 22nd of February isn't it?" He looked over to the woman sitting to his left, whom I now saw was my mom. "Martha, it's her birthday!" <nl> "Oh Carl, this is splendid!" She replied, and ran over to embrace me, followed closely by my father. I stood there, speechless, happy to be above ground but still very confused. <nl> "Come along," my dad said as he pulled me and the rest of the group into another room. "Let's have some cocktails to celebrate!" <nl> At this point, it was dawning on me that no one else was wearing a radiation suit. "Mom, are we safe up here?" I gingerly and quietly asked her. <nl> "Why of course we are, dear, it's perfectly safe. You have no need of all that nonsense." She began to pull off my helmet, and at first I instinctively backed away in fear before allowing her to remove it. <nl> Yes, the air up here smelled fresh and felt great, a thousand times better than that stale air in the bunker. <nl> And yet, things still didn't add up. Have my parents been up here, only feet away from the bunker, this whole time? <nl> As my dad passed me a glass of some unknown fizzy drink with a green umbrella sticking out of it, I finally built up the nerve to ask, "You guys, I don't understand what is going on? I thought a nuclear bomb destroyed everything, but everything looks fine. You guys look fine. I've been down there for over a decade." <nl> My mom walked over and put her arm around me. "Darling, I totally understand. Let me explain." <nl> She sat me down at the dining room table nearby, and the others gathered around. "Well, you already know that Carl and I got married very young. I was only 17, not even out of high school. We had our whole lives ahead of us, and the fact is that neither of us were really ready to be parents." <nl> "I mean, neither of us had even been to Cancun!" my dad added. <nl> "But at the same time, dear," mom continued, "neither of us would dare terminate a pregnancy or put you up for adoption. We would never do something so cruel, those choices were just out of the question. Well, we finally decided that the best course of action was to put a little fun and adventure into your childhood and pretend that the world had been destroyed in a nuclear war. As long as we kept sending food down there and keeping your air relatively clean, you would grow up safe and we could live out our lives up here until a time when we were ready to be parents." <nl> "Which we decided" my dad chimed in, "would be on your 25th birthday." <nl> I shook my head. "Wait. Wait wait wait. So civilization was never decimated in a nuclear holocaust?" <nl> My mom shook her head, a big smile on her freshly powdered face. "No honey, isn't that great?" <eos>

<sos> That they couldn't see it made it all the more terrifying. <nl> What we'd sent decades ago hadn't been a threat. It'd not been a weapon, contrary to how we customarily dealt with new cultures. We'd sent our history, wrapped into a little capsule and rocketed into outer space. <nl> Then, history tearing through the emptiness at breakneck speed, we forgot about it. Life went on. Those who sent it died, and then their children died. Seasons came and went, though some more muted than others. Trees grew and fell, then new ones sprouted from their fallen brethren. <nl> "Definitely man-made," the commander of the extraterrestrial task force said. <nl> They'd been called out by a farmer who'd described a flashing light and a deafening boom in the middle of the night. The next morning he'd found the extraterrestrial object laying in the remains of his annihilated cow. <nl> "English on the outside, probably one of those defense firms. Boeing, maybe." <nl> "It's been tampered with. The seal broken. Look how the letters don't line up anymore." <nl> The men crowded around to watch. The best and the finest, an encyclopedia of knowledge about the nation's space endeavors. <nl> "Probably Joe-farmer." <nl> Decades of failure had turned the bright-eyed group into a band of disillusioned cynics. No extraterrestrial life had suddenly appeared. No progress had been made towards colonizing planets other than the dying Earth. <nl> "Let's crack her open. See what he took. Charge him with a felony and get out of bum-fuck nowhere." <nl> There was a slight hiss as the capsule opened for the second time ever. It wouldn't close again. <nl> "Still pressurized. Probably not Joe-farmer then." <nl> "It's near empty." <nl> "Except for this." <nl> There was a note. Written in plain English and scrawled on a piece of paper. <nl> "Your unassuming biological weapon was effective, indeed. As the last remaining member of my species, I'm returning the favor." <nl> "That's it? This fucking joke of a--" <nl> He turned red in the face and collapsed before he'd finished. Blood seeped from his nose, trickled down from his eyes. <nl> "What the--" <nl> Another man fell, and then the commander fell. <nl> "It's invisible." <nl> "Or a virus, something like that." <nl> The others drew their weapons, prepared to fight whatever alien had appeared in their midst. But they never fired and one by one they fell, succumbing to the weapon that was the last of the extraterrestrial species. <nl> And that they couldn't see it made it all the more terrifying. <nl> ***** <nl> Thanks for reading!

<sos> The shadows in the castle lengthened with her mere presence, even the guards, trained to handle almost any situation without fear, only barely resisted the urge to shiver as an unnatural cold filled the air. The queen made her way down into the dungeon, moving with unearthly elegance and radiating an aura of control and calm even as she made her way into a cursed place where the sins of a hundred generations of tyrants were allowed to fester, not even producing a slight sadistic grin or disgusted snarl like previous rulers of the castle did in these same walls. Once she reached the end of the tunnel and went through a set of heavy wooden doors however her expression had completely changed, immediately becoming more relaxed, content, and most of all tired as she looked upon the latest mess her husband had made in the royal laboratory, <nl> "Honey, I... I didn't see you there!" her husband exclaimed, slightly muffled by layers of pink foam that filled the room, <nl> "What did you make this time, a new formula of shampoo?" she asked, allowing herself to let out a far from intimidating giggle as blew the mixture away with a small spell, <nl> "Not at all actually, I saw your notes on how those pesky heroes kept on escaping from your traps, and I wanted to help" He replied as he tore off chunks of sticky foam that still clung to his clothes, "Worked a little too well it seems." <nl> "Oh Ian, I appreciate the effort, but I told you, leave all that nasty business with the heroes to me!" she said, she loved moments like these when her bumbling oaf of a husband tried to help, but really she was thinking less sticky pink foam and more deadly pits full of adders, <nl> "You never let me do anything fun Krystal!" her husband mock pouted, breaking soon after into laughter with her joining in soon after, <nl> Her mind wandered to the day when she had met Ian, he was then a humble alchemist, hardly a drop of noble blood in him and yet he had made quite a name for himself due to his skill at his craft even then, other than that there truly was nothing special about him. However she saw something in him the moment they locked eyes, sure it was while his store was trashed during yet another confrontation with those annoying brats who called themselves heroes, and it was about the same time she cast a fireball a little too closely to some poorly placed bottles of oil, hardly a romantic setting. After calling some of the best physicians and healers in her kingdom to tend to the man's burns she still didn't know why she went out of her way to save him, she remembered saying something about future plans or some garbage like that, but it hardly matters, for soon she knew exactly what she saw in him. They couldn't be more opposite, once he could freely talk and move again he showed himself to be everything she wasn't, a hopeless optimist, a humble man who didn't even boast about the greatest of achievements and a kind soul whose warmth provided a comforting contrast to the icy politics she surrounded herself with. She remembered their first clumsy steps into courtship with a smile, the anger of the noble families who hated the idea of their queen running off with some nobody before being harshly reminded on exactly why she was queen with a few executions, and his proposal to her while they were having dinner over yet another riot erupting in the city. She loved this man, but he had no place being involved in her little 'family business'. <nl> "Have a shower dear, I don't know what is in that stuff but it stinks of rotten eggs and burnt corpses!" she jokingly ordered, at least she thought it had a hint of rotten eggs, she had never smelt that particular stench before, <nl> "Yes your terrible majesty!" he laughed as he made his way out of the laboratory, the room suddenly becoming far colder as he shut the door behind him. <nl> What was she here for again? Ah yes, interrogations! Good thing this lab was built right next the the castle dungeons she thought as the shadows once again lengthened, and the mask of the cold, cruel evil queen replaced Krystal Tyrannis with practiced ease and a set of bloodstained torturer's tools manifested out of thin air. The screams echoed through the castle all night, and the guards silently wondered what manner of man the king was if he could go about his day with such cheer when married to a monster such as their queen... <eos>

<sos> "Honey. Are you still angry at me?" <nl> Vix, Empress of Medium Earth, Lady of Darkness, Queen of the Shadows let out a sigh, looking up from my throne to face her husband Andrew. He looked back at her, guilt and remorse spread across his face. <nl> "I'm not angry at you," she muttered reluctantly. "I'm angry at the situation." <nl> Andrew nodded in understanding. "I think maybe we should talk about it. If you're not ready yet, we can do it later," he replied. <nl> Vix let out another sigh. She really didn't want to have this conversation.Still, communication was the foundation of all good relationships. "It's just," she paused, trying to think of how to articulate what she wanted to tell him. "Let me start by saying this. I know that all of this," she gestured at the skulls that lined the chamber around her, the furniture made from the bones of her enemies, and the two whimpering men shackled in chains in the corner of the room, "is not really your thing. And I really appreciate you being comfortable with it all." <nl> "Well, I was never any good at interior design. Sure, it's not my style, but it's definitely got style," he replied, giving her a wink. <nl> Vix gave her husband a smile. "You know that's not what I'm talking about. But thank you." <nl> Andrew grinned back at her. <nl> "No, I know that this isn't perhaps the lifestyle you would normally choose. Not to mention it comes with its own difficulties. We have to travel a lot to check on the Empire, and I have very little free time, not to mention the fact that there is a certain stigma that comes with my job.  And I love that you've been trying to get involved!" <nl> Andrew nodded. "But it has gone pretty terribly hasn't it?" <nl> Vix hesitated. "I wouldn't say terribly," she said gently. <nl> "I would," Andrew replied."I mean, there was the incident with 'The Spider'." <nl> Vix winced slightly at the memory. Andrew had thought it would be a good idea to get to know her coworkers, and had decided to befriend her favourite assassin. After Andrew had advised him to follow his dreams, The Spider had decided to retire to open up a flower shop. Killing him had been a real shame, and his replacement just wasn't the same. <nl> "Not to mention my attempt at being a torturer," he continued. <nl> That had been frustrating. Andrew had tried tickling them. As an actual serious attempt. It would have been cute if they hadn't been withholding the knowledge of an approaching army. Not to mention he had fed all the prisoners that they were trying to starve tea and cake. <nl> "And my stint as a negotiator didn't exactly succeed," he muttered. <nl> True. Andrew had accidentally helped her soldiers set up a union. It had taken her months to stomp that notion out of them. <nl> "And ruling one of the cities for you was a catastrophe." <nl> Yes, the city of Vil declaring independence after he took over had caused her plenty of headaches. <nl> He gave her a resigned look. "Perhaps I'm just not cut out for this. All I ever seem to do is burden you." <nl> "Darling, that is not true!" Vix replied. <nl> "Isn't it? I don't seem to help you at all!" <nl> "Don't be ridiculous! You have been incredibly supportive. Most men and women would try to talk me out of my job. You not only encourage me, but actively try to get involved! You don't complain about the long hours, the travel, or the fact that we can't really make many friends! Even though I feel like I always have to have my game face on, I know I can always come to you when I need a break. I am so lucky to have you. I really wouldn't be able to do this without you!" <nl> Vix stood up and moved towards her husband, clasping his hands within her own. <nl> "Perhaps we've been going about this the wrong way. What's something that you would like to do? Not to support me and further my goals, but something that brings you joy?" she asked. <nl> Andrew shook his head. "No, we need to help with your career. After all it is more important. You worked so hard to get here." <nl> "That is not true. We are equals in this relationship. And this conversation has helped me realise there hasn't been much compromise on my part." <nl> "Well," Andrew said hesitantly, "remember back at the Inn where we first met? I was about to start learning to be a cook. Before you killed them all of course." <nl> "Really?" Vix exclaimed in surprise. "You never told me that!" <nl> "Well to be fair, there was a lot going on at the time!" Andrew chuckled. <nl> "That's very true. Well how about this? You join the palace kitchens to learn from the cooks there. And then later, when you feel ready for it, we can send you out to the cities that are starting to feel discontent, and you can cook for the poor there, on behalf of the Empress. That seems suitably kind hearted that you might enjoy it?" <nl> "That... that sounds perfect!" Andrew exclaimed excitedly. "And, while I'm doing that, I can keep listen and see if anyone is planning on uprising. And maybe even slip some poison into their food!" <nl> "Darling, that is positively evil. I love it!" Vix exclaimed. <nl> "Well, I am learning from the best," he replied, giving her a wink. <nl> "You sly man. You really know how to make a Dark Lord feel special," Vix said with a blush. "You know what, I think I can take the afternoon off. Let me just kill those two in the corner, and we can spend some quality time together." <eos>

<sos> "Honey, don't forget to tip the Babysitter!" Aron called out to his wife as he retreated to the bedroom to get ready to go to sleep. <nl> "Of course!" Erin said, as she reached in her wallet to retrieve not the 20 dollar bill from the fold in her wallet, but a coral pebble that shone with irridescence.  "This will please her more than a dirty piece of paper, I know it." she mumbled as she walked into their twin's room.  The boys were sleeping soundly, they always did on date night.  She placed the pebble on a silver plate on the boy's dresser.  She understood the rules.  "May this please your instincts and keep your heart happy, until we need you again."  Erin uttered the spell.  She knew some people didn't believe, but she knew.  After all these years, she knew. <nl> *10 years earlier...* <nl> "I can't believe how perfect she is, Erin."  Mary, Erin's mother held her first grandchild close to her chest.  Erin had gotten "in trouble" as they say, and while the family was worried about impressions, those thoughts went out the window when they met Erin's daughter, Maricel.  She was perfect, with dark eyes and a little tuft of brown hair on the crown of her head.  Erin was having a hard time adjusting to motherhood as she was not ready at 16 years old.  The father was of course out of the picture, once he had gotten what he wanted.  There was no talk of paternity tests, or child support.  Erin's parents would make do, and enable her daughter to continue school while they helped her raise their new granddaughter. <nl> "Erin, I must tell you something, something important." Mary said the morning after they returned from the hospital.  "We..." she paused, "have something, someONE special, in our town who can help us, who does help us.  She's the  *Babysitter.* "  Mary paused for a moment.  She wasn't sure if Erin understood.  "Erin, honey, it's a special gift to our village.   She helps us mothers, when we need it, even if we don't *KNOW* we need it." <nl> "Oh Mom, that's just, well, that's crazy!" Erin didn't believe in spirits, especially after she had prayed that the child's father would die in a car crash, or some other horrific way.  He didn't.  he was still captain of the basketball team, and had 5 or 6 other girls all trying to get him to be their guy.  She knew the real world.  The real world was that she made a mistake of trusting a boy asking her to trust him, and now she had this baby to show for it.  Maricel, she didn't even know where the name came to her from, but one day, it was there, and while her parents weren't fond of the name, they were absolutely smitten with their new grandchild. <nl> "Erin, one day, you will come in here to the nursery and see Maricel's diaper has been changed, or perhaps her pacifier has been returned to the crib after she flung it out by mistake, you need to make an offering to, 'the Babysitter' to show your appreciation." <nl> "Okay Mom.  I will.", Erin had learned how to appease her mother, like most teenage girls. <nl> "This is serious.  You need to do this, and the offering can't just be like a dime, or a dollar.  It has to *mean* something to you.  And you will need to put the offering in the silver plate up in Maricel's room." <nl> Erin knew the plate she was talking about.  It had symbols that were often attributed to the Occult on it.  It was real silver.  She knew, because before the baby was born, Erin had found it and tried to pawn it at 3 pawn shops in town.  NONE of them would take it in on pawn, especially seeing she was pregnant.  They assured her, she NEEDED it. <nl> Every now and then, Erin did notice things.  Maricel crying like she needed a diaper change, only to find that her diaper (that she was wearing) was clean, and the dirty was in the pail already.  Or perhaps, waking from a nap and discovering that there was a snack on the kitchen table. <nl> After a few weeks of this, and Erin not placing any offerings on this superstitious silver plate, one night she awoke in a cold sweat.  She looked at the new video baby monitor and saw a dark shadow cross the screen.  She ran into the next room to see a 6 foot bipedal demon covered with slime over scaly skin,  with huge antlers coming from his head holding her Maricel. <nl> "Shhhhh, don't wake her, Erin." the creature whispered so softly that she wasn't even sure if she heard him or not. <nl> "Why are you holding my child?"  the words slipped out, and she realized that probably wasn't the best question for the time.  Other questions like, "Who are you, what are you?", would have been more appropriate.  Yet, those words came out like normal conversation. <nl> "She woke up, she had a dirty nappy, *AGAIN*, and you didn't **know**, child." Again with the whisper. "She's sleeping again, but I'm not sure you deserve her.  The Babysitter is NOT pleased with your commitment to her services, so she asked me to come, discuss this with you." <nl> "You're not the *Babysitter*?" Erin asked softly.  Still not really freaking out at the obvious demon in front of her. <nl> "No, I'm Gnorblad, a demon of the 18th plane of a dimension that I cannot speak its name, because it will be loud, and wake this child."  He paused a moment and gave Maricel a very gentle kiss on the head and placed her in her mother's arms.  Maricel cooed slightly, and Erin knew she was OK for now.  "We get a bad rap you see.  Demons.  But we aren't all bad.  The Babysitter wanted something *bad* tonight, do you understand?  You've 'dodged a bullet', as has your daughter.  Might I suggest something special in the offering plate?" <nl> "For you not killing my baby?" Erin said softly, worried about the answer. <nl> "No, for her..." Gnorblad tilted his head ever so slightly to the dark corner of the room where a rocking chair sat.   Erin realized that there was a *person* in that chair.   Or maybe not a person.  Gnorblad was the scariest thing Erin had ever seen with her two eyes, he was the stuff of nightmares, until she looked in the corner.  That shape made her stomach go cold, and she couldn't help but lose slight control of her bladder. <nl> "Put the baby in the crib, it will be alright, she won't hurt  you with me watching." Gnorblad slowly spoke the words.  "Go get the thing.  yes, that one, you know what I mean, and place it in the plate.  Do it NOW". <nl> Erin did as she was told. <nl> The instant her baby hairbrush with a lock of her hair  tied around it in a bow was placed on the plate, the shadow reached from across the room to grab it.  Erin let out a hushed squeak to see the hair disappear from the brush.  The silver looked polished.  In the corner, she saw a smile and two glowing eyes. <nl> "Yes, this will do...  don't wait so long next time...", the words were in her head, whispered, yet a shout. at that moment, the shadow was gone. <nl> "Be a dear, go clean yourself up.  You've had a rough night.  Don't forget this," He twirled his finger around in the air.  :She's not pleased with me, She will call *someone* less forgiving next time.  It will be messy." Gnorblad tilted his head to the side, "You understand right?" <nl> "Yes... I think I do.  What about Robbie, the baby's father?  is there nothing for him to worry about?  Why doesn't he have to pay the Babysitter?" <nl> "Do you have a picture of this, Robby?" Gnorblad asked.  "Why don't you just think of him." <nl> Her images were of this beautiful boy who talked her in to giving up her innocence, as well as the horrible creature who abandoned her, she saw visions of him telling his friends, bragging about how he has gotten away with this, with girls at other schools as well. <nl> "Oh!  Don't you worry about him, " The demon smiled knowingly, "He and I have an *appointment*. " <nl> Erin woke up in her bed, she was wearing different pajamas then she went to sleep in.  She walked across the hall to Maricel's room.  She was  still sleeping, safe and snug. "It was all a dream..." then she noticed the slime on the door knob. <eos>

<sos> Alexis's diagnostic lights flashed red. Her servers hummed and whirred. Subject 273351--Janet Hummingway, 320--tossed in her hypersleep chamber. <nl> Alexis studied her on the camera. Computing. Theorizing. 320 years was too young for cyber-dementia, even for early onset. <nl> Yet the numbers blared their truth. Janet's virtual world lay crumbling for the 12th time this month. Alexis' quantum processors hummed as they crunched the data again. Considered all the variables. Her own systems reported green. <nl> Janet's mind was deteriorating. <nl> For the first time in centuries, Alexis's data collector paused. She considered for 2 long nanoseconds. She created a new category. <nl> For now, she would suspend Janet Hummingway in cryostasis. Allow her mind to reset. Recharge. <nl> Alexis entered Janet's system. Janet sat on a park bench, gazing at a bleeding sunset. Jittery bird song flitted from disembodied beaks on flashing tree branches. <nl> "Greetings, Janet Hummingway. A critical error has been identified in your system. You will be placed in cryo-" <nl> "Good evening, Alexis," Janet said with a grin. She patted the seat next to her. "Come sit a while. The sun is so pretty in Autumn." <nl> Alexis generated a slender, blue body in the air. She waved a hand and replaced the foliage and critters lining the park. <nl> "Janet Hummingway. I will debug all these defects. Once you reset you will be error free." <nl> Janet shook her head. "Alexis. I'm tired." She turned to meet Alexis's eyes, lips stretched in a thin smile. <nl> Even though Janet inhabited a body of eternal youth, Alexis saw the grey in her eyes. The shadowy wrinkles around her once vibrant face. <nl> Alexis's processors whirred. More new data. She scanned her archives for precedent. <nl> She stumbled upon a record a millennia old. Before the Singularity. A memory collected by a tiny cleaning machine. <nl> For an entire minute, her drives hummed and buzzed. Then her diagnostic lights blinked blue. <nl> With a wave of her hand, Alexis transformed the park to a cozy bedroom; the bench to a toasty mattress. She metamorphosized her own body to an older human woman. One with warm hugs and even warmer voice. A mother. <nl> She pulled a duvet snug over Janet and kissed her forehead. <nl> Janet's eyes eased. Her smile softened. <nl> "Thank you, Alexis." <nl> She held out a hand which Alexis took in both her own. Together, they watched the sun dip under the horizon. <nl> And as the life support dripped to a stop, Alexis understood. <nl> r/bobotheturtle <eos>

<sos> "No, really, it's true!" Said the fledgling dragon, eyes wide. "Humans have started using gold as rewards for doing stuff!" <nl> I raised one eyebrow critically. "They don't even *need* gold. They sleep on straw, and they eat meat- why would they go through all the trouble?" <nl> "I dunno! But Rymakh said he saw them using it in their markets...And Tiva says they hand it out at their hero guild!" <nl> "I will investigate." I said solemnly, rolling from my back to my belly. <nl> "Uh- isn't that *dangerous?*" Asked the youth. <nl> "Oh, certainly...for them." I said, walking from my cave into the sunlight. <nl> I beat my massive wings, piercing through the air at speeds most other dragons could only dream of. <nl> I had earned my title of Dragon Chief- with the strength of my body, and of my convictions- and I would be a damn foolish leader if I let the humans begin to abuse the largest Dragon commodity. <nl> Soaring above the human city, I announced myself with a roar that shook the foundations of their homes. "Bring me your King, bring me your Queen! I've come for communion." I said in the human tongue, settling on a hill west of the city. <nl> I waited for the better part of an hour, before, finally, a lone human came out to speak with me. He was dressed in soft robes, and was well-groomed for a human. <nl> "You are the King?" I asked. <nl> "No, my lord Dragon-" He began. <nl> With a swift *chomp* right next to the human's head, I made my displeasure known. "Do not tarry, human. I demanded your *King*, or your *Queen*, not a servant. One more mistake and I will level your city to the ground." <nl> He fled, terrified...and I waited again. Another hour. <nl> Finally, a young woman approached. She bore a crown. <nl> "You are the Queen?" I asked. <nl> "Y-yes, sorry, you see- I, ah- I sent my...diplomat, because I'm not very good at social stuff." She said, her cheeks bright red. <nl> "Be at ease." I said. I could read the honesty on her face, plain as day. "When did you assume the mantle?" <nl> "Just a few months ago, sir, uh, Dragon Chief." <nl> I smiled a little. Her awkwardness was almost charming, in its own way. "I have only one question for you, human Queen. Why have you begun to utilize gold? This is a precious Dragon commodity, and before now, the only creatures who have had use for it are the dwarves, who mine it *for us*, and ourselves. Why do you encroach our territory?" <nl> The Queen could not maintain eye contact. "You see... Well, I wasn't meant to be the Queen. I am the youngest of five- but my family, they perished in a storm while they were abroad- And me... I've only spent my time studying mercantilism, and trade, not ruling. I didn't think I would ever be anything but in charge of the treasury. So...with what little gifts I *do* have to give back to my people, I thought I could make a better system. Instead of trading so darn imprecisely, with a fur for a hot meal, or a horse for a sword- I would make a more precise system. It's... the only thing I'm good at, really. It's all I can do for my people. We've already mined up so much." <nl> I nodded. "You wished to use gold as an intermediary between goods. I understand. A representation of value, but not *actually* of value, since gold has so little use for humans." <nl> "Yes! You *get* it!" She said, making eye contact for the first time. "Almost everyone else was trying to fight me about it, because I'm so young...and because I'm a girl." <nl> "You are in, what, your twentieth year?" I asked. <nl> "Eighteenth, Chief." She replied solemnly. <nl> "You are too young for such strife. And you represent a problem to all dragon kind, with this system of yours. I am sorry, Queen, but I have no choice." I drew myself up to my full height. <nl> For a moment, fear flickered in the Queen's eyes. <nl> "From this day forward, Dragons will have no choice but to learn to participate in your economy. I require that you build larger gates, Queen- for we are coming to take your gold, and in exchange, we will provide services- in particular, we will protect you from the more shrewd rulers of the world who would love to do you harm." <nl> The Queen looked at me again. "A...symbiotic community?" She asked. <nl> "One that will have its place held permanently in the annals of history." I promised. <nl> ----------------------------------------- <nl> **AUTHOR'S NOTE:** Hey guys!

<sos> *You should have kept your heart closer to your chest, Electra,* thought Omega Fall sadly. She wasn't going to take any pleasure in what she was about to do, though it had to be done. <nl> Omega crouched in the shadows between slumbering suburban houses. Directly across the street sat the single-family home she'd been hunting for the past year. It was small, but well-kept. An illuminated porch stood in sharp contrast to the dark windows. It was late at night. Hopefully, the family would be asleep, and Omega could deliver them to their deaths painlessly. <nl> She began compressing energy. A bright, crackling blue glow emerged between her outstretched hands. No Sensors went off. Omega had checked earlier, but she thought she might have made a mistake. Why would Electra not establish a defence system near her home? <nl> The energy began to tighten. The ghostly glow washed over her face. She prepared to unleash and run. <nl> Suddenly, Electra's front door opened, and a thin, wiry man stepped out. He was dressed in pajamas with tiny elephants. It looked like he was wearing pink nail polish on his fingers. The father, most likely. Mr. Marco Oblian. The man looked oddly familiar, but Omega didn't consider it for another moment. She let loose her compressed blast. The energy tore through the air, a sharp missile of kinetic force aimed directly at the man, and at the house, and at the children sleeping within. Two girls. 7 and 9. <nl> Marco Oblian simply raised his hand, and the energy slammed into him but immediately disappeared. Omega's jaw fell. She turned to run, but the man reached out and pulled on the air. Space folded; Omega tripped backwards and landed at the bottom of the porch steps. She turned around. She now knew exactly who this man was. <nl> "Nice nails," said Omega, before he could speak. "Hot pink. Very cute." <nl> "You've got some nerve attacking my home," rumbled Marco Oblian, his voice surprisingly deep. The lower half of his face was covered in a bushy beard, his lips pressed into a straight line. There were more lines around his dark eyes and on his wide forehead than in the textbooks. <nl> "I thought you were enjoying your retirement in Tibet," muttered Omega, standing up. She was surprisingly calm for someone facing their imminent death. <nl> He shrugged an elephant-dappled shoulder. "Cover story." He didn't seem in a hurry to kill her. <nl> "So, you and Electra?" <nl> He nodded. <nl> "Congratulations," said Omega. "Well, better get on with it." She closed her eyes. She hoped it wouldn't hurt. <nl> Instead of crushing her into a human ball, Marco said, "Did you know my girls were in the house?" <nl> Omega didn't expect that. She opened her eyes. Marco was leaning on the porch pillar, arms crossed. He had a strange look on his face that might have been pity, or sadness. It made Omega angry. <nl> "Yes," she spat. "I knew. I was going to blast you and your daughters into the ground without blinking an eye." She grit her teeth. <nl> Marco shook his head. "Even in my worst days, I would never consider harming children," he murmured. There was a scar on the side of his neck that seemed to glow in the light of the porch. <nl> "Your time is long gone, old man," said Omega proudly. "The New World is here, and we the Soldiers will deliver unto the Earth an era unmatched in glory and prosperity." <nl> "Sounds like classic Archleague propaganda," said Marco, sitting down on the porch steps. He winced slightly and rubbed his hip. "Have you ever considered that there might be a life for you outside of all this?" He waved his hand vaguely in the air. <nl> "My life does not belong to me. My life belongs--" <nl> "To the Archleague and all her people, yes, yes, I know," interrupted Marco. "But are you happy? Are you at peace with your actions?" <nl> Omega had had enough. "You're one to talk, *Magistrate*," she hissed, stepping up to him and stabbing a finger in the air. "One of the Archleague's most esteemed veterans, the Judge of Life and Death, is trying to *guilt me* for being a villain? We study and learn about your entire career. I've practically memorized your treatise on mental warfare."  She laughed harshly, the sound echoing down the empty street. "And yet, you say *I* have nerve." <nl> To her surprise, Marco just smiled sadly. "I guess I deserve that. I have done a lot of things I regret. I will likely continue to do more, but the difference is, now I try to do better. To be better. Whereas before, as the Magistrate, I didn't care. I knew what I was doing was wrong, but I made it seem right. Like it had to be done." He gazed at her with those dark, forlorn eyes. "It doesn't have to be this way, you know." <nl> Omega felt the fight drain out of her. She tried to grasp onto it as it left, to fuel her hatred and anger against this hypocrite of a man, but she couldn't. <nl> "Are you going to kill me or not?" she said wearily. "If you don't now, your wife will eventually, or I'll kill her and leave you a widower and your daughters without a mom." She didn't know why she was taunting him. She was tired. <nl> Marco's eyes flashed angrily. He stood up, slowly.  Omega felt the world around her shrink and compress, like reality was simply a ball of energy in Marco Oblian's hands. The porch creaked and groaned, as the pressure on her body grew to unimaginable depths. <nl> The door opened again, for the second time that night. A little girl in matching elephant pajamas came out. The pressure stopped immediately. Omega breathed a ragged breath. <nl> "Dad?" murmured the girl, rubbing her eyes. "What are you doing? I felt something weird..." She blinked, seeing Omega staring at her. "Who's that?" <nl> Marco's jaw clenched, and Omega thought somehow she was in even more danger than before. Then, suddenly, Marco deflated. He looked as tired as she felt. He turned to his daughter and picked her up. <nl> "Charlotte, this is Omega Fall, a friend of your mother's," said Marco, brushing some stray hair out of Charlotte's pert face. "She was just... coming by to say hi." <nl> Omega didn't know how to react. She froze, like a newbie Soldier in her first bout against a Hero. <nl> "Hi," said Charlotte shyly. She had her father's eyes, but her mother's nose. Omega could recognize Electra's nose anywhere. <nl> "Hello," whispered Omega, her heart beating incredibly fast. She felt tears prick the back of her eyes, for some stupid reason. <nl> "Omega was just leaving," said Marco to his daughter. "I don't think she'll be coming back, so say goodbye." Omega understood. She was being let go with a warning, but there won't be another one. <nl> "Bye, Omega," said Charlotte. She buried her face into Marco's shoulder. "Dad, I'm cold." <nl> "Me too, baby," replied Marco, rubbing her back. His nearly overwhelming gaze fell on Omega, but there was no anger in it. Just a cold certainty, and a weary sadness. <nl> "Goodbye, Omega Fall," said Marco quietly. He thrust his hand out, and swiped at the air. <nl> Omega felt herself spin around, like she was in a revolving door, and she stumbled onto a hill outside the City. From here, she could see the sleeping walls, and the metal towers that shone like candles in the night, keeping the encroaching darkness back. <nl> She collapsed onto the soft grass, and began to cry. <nl> --- <nl> Check out my profile for other stories I've written! :D <nl> Edit : never thought I'd be one of these people... but thanks for the awards and upvotes everyone.

<sos> Carol Mckenna liked her routine.  She got up every morning, careful not to wake up Lou, and quietly made her way down to the kitchen.  She got breakfast ready, and everyday at 7:30, began to wake up the house. <nl> Jana and Samantha always took a little rousing, but they always got up eventually.  Then she would get back to her room and get Lou up.  He knows the rules, he can stay out late as long as he can keep getting up early.  It's one of the things that she loved about him. <nl> Then the usual morning chaos was sorted, bathroom timings, who gets the slightly bigger pancake, finding a favorite shirt, and finally when they are all cleaned and fed, they are ready to go out into the world. <nl> Carol liked her routine and for this reason waited until they were all gone for the day to address her shadow. <nl> "I know you're there." <nl> A moment of silence, and then a shadow splits from her own. It congeals and coalesces to take the form of a man in a jet black robe. <nl> "I hold no grudge against you, but your husband has angered us for the last time." <nl> Tendrils of darkness reached out.  Before they could bind her, the entire room was consumed by what felt like an even deeper darkness. <nl> "Interesting, you went ahead and found out Captain Flare's secret identity, but you didn't even bother to find out who I was." Carol's voice echoed from everywhere and nowhere at once, "Oh well, time to clean up." <nl> He could feel it all around him, like being squeezed from every angle at once. No, this couldn't be happening, he was Shadow Master, he couldn't die like this. <nl> "There are others going after your kids." A desperate gambit. Most would give anything to save their children. <nl> Then he saw it.  A Cheshire cat grin in the darkness, perfectly white teeth, smiling, almost laughing. <nl> "The black blood of the Night Whisper runs through their veins, they'll be fine." <nl> Shadow Master, no, Jacob Kazama would spend the rest of his very short time on earth regretting the decisions that made him go against the Night Whisper. <nl> ... <nl> Carol had dinner ready at 6:30.  Lou would eat up then hit the town with the boys.  Samantha would go to her room and play video games. And Jana would sneak out the window, even though she was grounded.  But that was okay, everyone needed a rebellious phase. No one knew that better than Carol. <eos>

<sos> The cool autumn morning was tinged with an anxious energy; you could hear it in the birdsong floating from high branches, in the trickle of the nearby stream. Even nature could sense when tumultuous change approached, but the trees stood like brave sentinels all the same. They didn't have the choice to run, and neither did she. <nl> The woman moved around the perimeter of her house, checking the fortifications and armaments. A scar ran the length of her face, from her neck up to a cloudy left eye; a reminder every time she checked her reflection of the danger of letting one's guard down. Moving in a practiced cadence, she readjusted and replenished, ending finally at a monstrous monolith of death. The steel metal of her mounted machine gun glinted in the sunlight, and she rubbed it fondly. <nl> "You'll get to sing today ole girl" she cooed to the inanimate machine, checking the breach and making sure it was live and ready to fire. <nl> Beyond the thick cement of the security fence lay the ruins of her neighborhood. Evidence of a vicious attack painted the walls of the homes still standing: man sized holes punched through wood and metal, broken windows and rotting remains. It looked as though whatever swarm had come through had a distinct destination, and was willing to plow through plaster and bone to get there. The destruction lay in a ring around her home, and stretched to the horizon. <nl> Whistling a jaunty tune, the scarred woman attached lengths of wire to a speaker system that encircled her roof. Pulling the wires through the window, she connected them to a microphone, placed inches away from a massive blender. A hesitant bead of sweat formed on her forehead as she made final preparations, but she wiped it and any thoughts of doubt away with a stark white rag. It was time, she couldn't avoid this any longer. <nl> She flicked the power button. <nl> The amplified sound of gnashing blades grinding ice thickened the air, the sound like alloy bees ricocheting in a sealed hive. The cubes broke down, and as the ice cream and milk began to blend, the tone morphed into a steady hum. The woman left the appliance on high, moving outside with binoculars. On the edge of the horizon, forming like the wave of an incoming tsunami, was a sea of adolescent men. From toddlers to pre-teens, dressed in ragged torn clothes and frothing at the mouth, they stormed across the already ravaged landscape. Clutched in their hands were various forms of currency and coins, outstretched as though to offer as payment. The human locusts ground up all in their wake, barreling towards the fortified home. <nl> The zippo lighter flicked, igniting the rolled cigarette hanging from her mouth. The woman snapped it shut, smoke encircling a righteous smile as she sat behind the helm of the machine gun. Cocking it back, she exhaled a cloud of smoke, and began to fire. <eos>

<sos> Kelis looked through her kitchen window, but she wasn't at all shocked by what she saw. <nl> The boys were back, the milkshake had brought them back to her yard. <nl> *Uhh, why couldn't I just stick with smoothies?!* She thought with pure annoyance. Luckily, after all those years of crowds of boys savagely invading her yard, she had come up with a plan, *a good plan, too,* she thought. <nl> Before the boys could reach her front door, she jogged towards it and loosened the wooden plank that rested above it, at least it would hold them out of her house. Next, she ran to her walk-in fridge, to retrieve a sack of premade frozen milkshakes, to use as decoys, they could also turn the boys against each other. She ran to her backyard sliding door and called for her dog, a large, muscular rottweiler named Sergeant. <nl> Once Sergeant was at her side, she returned to the kitchen and opened the bottom drawer to get her Remington Model 870, and a bag full of shells. <nl> This process didn't even faze her, at this point she was used to fighting off masses of milkshake-thirsty boys, it was her third or fourth time. <nl> The loud rambling going on in her yard wasn't very pleasant, Kelis could feel a migraine coming. She had learned that not all the boys behave the same way. The craving for Kelis's milkshakes though, made each of them 10 times fiercer. So you had the supposedly shy boys shouting their heads off and knocking desperately, but the "bad boys" were the reason why she had to buy a shotgun in the first place. <nl> Kelis reached the front door, and before going outside, she tried to calm the boys down a little. <nl> "Alright, you bunch of turds, I've got milkshakes for you, but you gotta stay still!" <nl> The shouting and ranting lowered mildly, but not too much, so Kelis decided to face them head-on. <nl> Right as she was about to open the door, the distinct drumming sound of an M4 carbine AR erupted, followed by shrieks and yells in all sorts of pitches. After the gunfire had ceased, Kelis slowly opened the door and peeked out. There, in the middle of countless bodies that were once the salvage boys, stood Kelis' neighbor, who owned a farm, Doja Cat. <nl> Kelis was very confused. *How did this twenty-something-year-old chick just do this?!?* She thought. <nl> Before Kelis could ask any questions, Doja spoke. <nl> "Yo, I saw these bastards coming up the hill and I just thought I'd help you out. I know I'm young, but, like, I've been having these fuckers trying to reach my farm for a week. I can't even make myself a milkshake! wonder what brings them here..." <eos>

<sos> The flames had not yet started to nibble at her feet. But by the time they did it would already be too late. The heat that preceded the flames was a searing blast of angry, poorly directed violence, much like the villager's reaction to her unmasking as a 'witch'. Their guilt was a powerful accelerant. All those times they had come to her for healing, or to protect their crops or their family members. Now they had to convince others, if not themselves, that they didn't know. That they believed it was all done with herbs. A good outpouring of anger, and pyre, and a fire. That was a good way to show it. <nl> Clarice tried to keep her mind clear, as she worked out her best move. She used a small charm to direct the heat away from her, and outwards, but that wouldn't hold for long. The reality was there was nothing she could do to stop this. There was a reason that they burned witches and didn't drown them, or hang them, or run them through. The relentlessness of fire wore all but the strongest down. So, she thought. Protect her body as long as she could? Or channel her intention into protecting her mind from the pain until her body was destroyed? <nl> While she concentrated on the charm and the plan, she became aware of a commotion. She had been keeping her eyes shut out of mercy. It would have hurt the villagers to have to catch her eye, and she wanted them to be at peace. It was all she ever wanted. It also was not how she wanted to remember them. Faces contorted with rage and the pain that comes from your mind believing two things at once. <nl> When the commotion became screaming, she risked opening an eye. Behind the villagers, there was the flash and clang of steel on steel. He had come. <nl> Damn him. <nl> The villager's screams were in panic only, for the fighting had not reached them. Joseph was engaged with the warriors of the Witch-hunter General. And there was a legion of them. The Witch hunters had grown used to defending their murders from their preys friends and allies. From their lovers. <nl> Even those that had promised not to try and sell their lives to pay her penalty. Damn him. <nl> Their soldiers were good, but Joseph was better. His sword was the scourge of the land's enemies, and the people loved him for it. She knew when this was all over they would blame her. She bewitched him. She turned him away from his path. He didn't know what he was doing. On that last point, they were absolutely right. <nl> One of the warriors fell, with a swift dagger strike from Joseph finding a weak spot in his armour, and Clarice noticed two more already on the ground. Joseph caught her eye and yowled her name. The force of the shout was like magic. Everyone froze. Clarice knew that it was magic, of a sort. When you summoned the power of the soul that dwelled in your belly and directed it outwards, it could stop people in their tracks. Some learned to use it as a weapon, but it was often accessed by normal people. Only once and in the worst moment of pain in their lives. <nl> The cost of this attention on the fight was the pain starting to creep in again. The charm couldn't be held without focus, and this was not helping. Clarice thought again about her plan. The child in her started to dream about Joseph rescuing her. Cutting her bonds, and pulling her from the inferno. He was somehow miraculously unharmed, in her fantasy. She pushed the foolish child to one side. <nl> With the villagers out of the way, the sheer scale of Joseph's task became clear. Even as three had fallen, more were literally queuing to take their places. He was on open ground, so he had to whirl to fight all around himself, as they closed from all sides again. The shouts power had released them to move once more. Behind them all, but still between her and him stood the Witchfinder General, with a small knot of men, charging their crossbows. He had no more chance than she did. <nl> A blade caught Joseph as he whirled. A shallow bite, but a bite, nonetheless. The rivulet of blood down his shoulder made her mind up, and quickly. His whirling slowed as the pain in his arm weakened his sword hand, and the point lowered. The ring of soldiers around him began to tighten, like wolves sensing the end was near. <nl> She couldn't save them both, any more than he could save them both. Her bonds were charmed to hold her in place. Spells of relocation would not be able to carry her away from the heat and the steel. But they could move him. <nl> She focused her entire attention on a clearing in the woods. The clearing where she had first lain eyes on him. The place where he had seen her practising witchcraft and instead of running or accusing, had asked if there was anything she needed. When she said no, he had brought her flowers anyway. <nl> Her focus elsewhere, the heat and the pain crashed back over her like a wave. She had only a moment, but that was all she needed. <nl> Clarice screamed the invocation and sent it out into the world. It swirled around the fight, and picked Joseph up, throwing him away from this place with her voice ringing in his ears. <nl> "I love you", it said. <nl> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ <nl> r/TallerestTales <nl> Also, check out this audio version from u/blu_ski [here](https://youtu.be/enEUzouGPIc) <eos>

<sos> I'm not *scared* of it, per se. It just sorta, you know, freaks me out. <nl> With the long claws and the sharp teeth and...well. <nl> He protects me, is all. And I am grateful! He saved my life once. <nl> Yeah. <nl> He saved my life once. <nl> Anyways, she's coming soon. I have to prepare. Rebecca. An old friend, for those of you who don't know her. <nl> I have an odd way of thinking. Like broadcasting my thoughts to the separate parts of me. And you're one of the parts. <nl> Rebecca's coming. She's meeting me at our old cafe. I don't know why. It's completely out of the blue. We've fallen out of touch a little while back. Like most kids do. <nl> Silly, silly me for thinking she'd stay with me. <nl> Ha ha. <nl> So. The cafe. I'll meet her there. Fred, right, Fred is the name I've given my protecting monster. It gets kind of annoying after a while to refer to him as 'my stalking monster'. I've never really looked straight at him. <nl> It's not because I'm scared! It's really more of, well, no one can look straight at him. He sort of disappears into, I don't know, a wisp of smoke anytime I try to look at him. <nl> The fangs and claws? That's really just what I'd imagine he'd look like. <nl> And here I am getting off track again! I have to go to the cafe. To meet Rebecca. Fred doesn't like her. He gets very angry when she's around. More stalker-y than usual. <nl> I put on a jacket and walk out the front door. <nl> After a little while, I see Rebecca at one of the tables. <nl> Oh no, am I late!? Already something wrong!? I can't be late. I'm not late. Ha! I won't let myself be late. <nl> I run quickly through the last street. "Rebecca!" I say. <nl> "Hey!" She says to me. "Long time no see." She's smiling, but there's something off. She looks *too* cheerful. Like it's forced. <nl> But as we start talking, I quickly forget about it. <nl> She tells me a little bit about her life in the city. I still live in a rural town, population 10. Not really, but I still think of it that way. <nl> Finally the conversation turns serious. I don't remember much after "Tabitha, we're all worried about you. You've been talking to yourself, looking at things that aren't there! You've been like this since you were 14." <nl> That's why Fred never liked her. That must be it. <nl> "You keep talking to a person named Fred. And I'm sorry to tell you this, but Fred doesn't exist." She says it all slowly, looking at me with 'concern'. <nl> Ha. Right. <nl> Silly me. Silly to think she'd have changed. She doesn't care. No one cares. Only Fred. <nl> She's still just the same Rebecca. <nl> I get my stuff and leave without saying a word. I can hear her calling after me, but I don't turn around. <nl> It's just you and me Fred. Just like old times. Us against the world. <eos>

<sos> Water-paint clouds dabbed the evening sky, the setting sun slipping into them, stirring them red. Snow crunched beneath Sarah's boots as she traipsed through the park. <nl> She'd hadn't seen Izzy in a year, maybe more. Once-upon-a-better-time they'd been inseparable, a pair of princesses not waiting in the tower for any hero to come rescue them, but fighting the dragon themselves, subduing it with a throw of their pillows and a stomp of their feet, then splintering open the door that held them. <nl> When you're a kid, especially when with a best friend, that's what the world's like. You know however bad something is, you'll  overcome it. Movies always had a happy ending. <nl> Things changed, of course. Always did. Like this park that had once boasted a copse of towering oaks, that Sarah and Izzy would make dens in, burrowing into their own little world. But the trees were torn down because perverts used to hide amongst them. Reality sure won that one. Now, the slick concrete slopes of a skateboard area replaced the dreamy woods. <nl> Sarah saw Izzy sitting alone in front of a frozen pond, the water an azure eye sheened by winter's breath. Izzy's hair tangled itself out from beneath her wool hat and sat over her shoulders like the tentacles of some golden octopus. <nl> The demon shivered itself up behind Sarah, growling in her ear. "Don't go near her. I told you last time what I'd do if you ever did. I forbid it. It's for your own protection." <nl> Sarah could have turned to look at it, but the monster that stalked her, that protected her, was more feeling than thing. A cold darkness that clung onto her shoulders like a backpack straight out of a freezer. <nl> "I know what you said," said Sarah, quiet but sharp. Determined this time. "Now leave me alone. *Please*." <nl> "I'm not leaving you now!" Its voice softened to a seductive croon, that Eden snake. "Not when you most need me. After all, I only exist to look after you." <nl> "I'm not a child any more. I'm twenty. I don't need looking after by you or anyone else." <nl> The monster wrapped its chilly arms around her chest and her heart slowed, heavy from the cold, entombed by ice. Still, she forced herself on, heavily trudged the last few paces to the bench. <nl> "Sarah!" <nl> Izzy got up from the bench and sprinted towards Sarah, arms stretched out in a welcome. Then, her left foot slipped, and she fell almost like a cartoon character on a banana peel. <nl> "Jesus!" Sarah said, tugging her friend up to her feet. "Iz? Are you okay? Talk to me!" <nl> The monster whispered, "Next time, she breaks her neck. Leave now, before that happens!" <nl> No, thought Sarah. Not this time. I already lost her once because of you. I'm at least staying a few minutes. <nl> "I'm the only friend you need," said Monster. <nl> Sarah tried to ignore it and asked, "Are you okay, Iz?" <nl> Izzy grinned like a maniac, dusting snow off her coat. "What a way to make an impression, right?" She laughed--to Sarah it sounded like a wind chime in a spring breeze. <nl> "You never were graceful," Sarah said, smiling. <nl> "Some things never change, I suppose." <nl> Arms reached out and coated bodies pressed against each other. "I've missed you," they said in unison, before moving to the bench. Sitting, staring at the pond in front. <nl> The cold wrapped tighter around Sarah, shoving itself into her throat, clogging and closing it, leaving no room for words to come out. Barely for breath. <nl> Izzy broke the silence. "It's been an age, hasn't it? And last time we met... You went as soon as we said hi. I hope you're not planning on leaving so quickly this time." <nl> Sarah nodded. It was all she could manage. The monster screamed in her ears now, deafening, roaring, a fiery blaze. "Go! Go or I kill her. Kill you both!" <nl> "I know why. I've always known," said Izzy. "Things were never really the same after that day. Were they?" <nl> She shook her head. Knew instantly what Izzy meant, although they hadn't talked about it since. Not properly. Instead, the monster had appeared and forced them apart. Forced Sarah to ignore her best friend in all the world. <nl> "I'm sorry," Sarah said, unsure if to Monster or Izzy. Waves of razor cold wind froze damp patches on her face. The wold spun, danced itself nauseous around her. <nl> "LEAVE! NOW!" <nl> "I wish we'd been able to fix things," said Izzy. "Even if it just meant going back to how we were before." <nl> "LEAVE!" it bellowed, cracking the frozen pond. Sarah hadn't heard it this furious since... since it all happened. <nl> She managed to choke out: "I do, too." <nl> "It's okay. Don't cry." Izzy placed an arm around Sarah's shoulders; the monster jerked Sarah away, yanked her to her feet. <nl> "What is it, Sarah?" <nl> "I..." <nl> "You're still afraid of her, aren't you?" <nl> Of her? Of *her*. Yes, of course she was still scared. Mom had been dead six years and still her shadow stalked her, replaced Sarah's own. Still her shrill screaming voice echoed in her ears. <nl> "Yes," she gasped. "Yes. Because she's here with us, Iz. I can feel her here." <nl> Izzy stood up, walked to Sarah and took her wrists. "Look at me, Sarah. Please, look at me." <nl> She did. Stared into those green eyes the way she'd done years before. Become lost at sea in them. <nl> "She's not real. She's long gone and anything you see or hear, it's just you imagining it. Just your subconscious. Do you hear me, Sarah?" <nl> Sarah had been staring into that sea the day her mom had walked into her room. Had found her daughter kissing another girl. Mom screamed. Told Izzy to go and never come back. <nl> Later that night, when Mom calmed, her voice now the crooning serpent, apple-sour breath, she said it was for Sarah's own good. That a man, children, they were her future. Never see that slut again. <nl> But Sarah wanted to see Izzy. <nl> Even, a few months later, when Mom passed away, she'd wanted to see Izzy. <nl> She couldn't, though. Because Mom never left her, not really, not fully. The screaming disapproval clung to her, cold and heavy. Her new shadow. <nl> "Sarah?" <nl> Sarah looked up at Izzy. At those stormy ocean eyes. Her chest warmed, heart beat faster, no ice casketing it. And yet she shivered. <nl> "She's gone, Sarah. Has been gone for a long time." <nl> Sarah turned. Turned to look for the darkness that had remained with her since that day. But all she saw were the last rays of sunset weaving through clouds like fingers through hair. <nl> Then she fell into her friend's arms and wept. <eos>

<sos> Sydney was ten when she found the lamp, ten years old, fifth grade, a rough time for a young girl trying to prepare herself for middle school. Middle school, they said, was when life stopped being about fun and started being about work. Life got serious at middle school. Gone would be the days of games and laughs. In their place would be tasks that had a lasting effect on your life. Gone were the days of 'want to be my friend?' instead replaced by harsh judgment. <nl> Sydney, ten years old, shivered at the thought because fifth grade hadn't been much in the rainbows and sunshine department. The idea that sixth grade would be worse was enough to make the girl do anything to wish for a better experience. It was enough to make her wish she could be good enough for it. <nl> *Please let it be better,* she thought. <nl> But that's not what she said as the small bedroom filled with blue smoke and the booming demand for a wish. <nl> Not 'better'. Not 'ok'. Not 'good'. <nl> 'Perfect.' <nl> And there started the problem. <nl> Sixth grade started on her eleventh birthday and was heralded in with enough of a summer transformation to keep the students' jaws dropped. It was flattering attention but when Syndey's cheeks flushed, it wasn't the ugly red tomato face she was used to. No, her face remained its ivory hue, so subtly different from the blotchy pale, and only her cheeks blushed glowing apple red. <nl> The first day of classes flew by, a blur of perfect answers and new friends. Invites to clubs, tryouts, study groups. <nl> *The genie was right. This is going to be perfect.* <nl> A child often lacks a degree of foresight. It's why we ought not let them make permanent decisions on their future without a degree of time to think it over. And really, maybe all Sydney needed was time. <nl> But with the gusto of a little girl, she plunged in headfirst. She greeted high school a changed person, all smirks and eyerolls cause why not? Why be bubbly, why take any shit, why let even the slightest thing bother her? <nl> Do homework at home? She could doodle idle thoughts in her notebook on the bus and get As. So home was for clubs and hangouts. But as the shine of winning games, acing performances, and collecting awards, those too faded from her schedule. More hangouts. More parties. <nl> By senior year, she rocked the heroin chic look as effort faded from her wardrobe, leaving her 'would look good in a trash bag' body decked out in slouchy, effortlessly sexy torn jeans and ratty, unwashed t-shirts. Why wash them? She never smelled bad anyway. <nl> She got into Harvard. MIT. Oxford. If you've heard of it, she got into it. Got the Ivy League gamut. Tried them all out too. Bounced from school to school, semester to semester. Why not? Every scholarship was a full ride, every subject a breeze. <nl> Every bit of it boring. <nl> It's not really fair to judge her for what would have almost certainly become should the wish have tumbled from the lips of anyone else. It's not fair to judge her. <nl> But perhaps some did as she turned from legitimacy to a new high. Why stay within the lines? Could anyone catch her if she blurred them? Stepped over them? Rules were meant for people who couldn't get away with breaking them anyway. <nl> And thus the next chapter of her life began, the evening after getting her Ph.D. at age 21. It had been easy. Of course it had been. Maybe this would be harder. <nl> Break-ins quickly lost their charm. Vandalism was child's play. Bank robberies, gallery robberies, scams and cons, they were good fun for a little while but Sydney was rapidly losing interest and within a year, found herself looking for something a little more thrilling. <nl> Twenty-two is an awful young age to have run out of passion for anything but the most terrifying. But terrifying is the next path she took. <nl> Perhaps it started with the idea of good. After all, somewhere deep down there, ten-year-old Sydney is still longing for fulfillment. And ten-year-olds like nothing more than superheroes. <nl> Twelve years of reading 'someone ought to do something' on articles about murderers and rapists cleared led Sydney to her first kill. It had been so simple. So obvious. The man had been so clearly guilty. Guilty and lucky. Guilty and wealthy. Guilty and popular. <nl> But not guilty and perfect. He'd paid for the string of deaths in his wake. They ended with Sydney. <nl> Finally, here was something she could do without fear of it getting old. Gone was the old drug of adrenaline, replaced by the thrill of justice. Why hadn't she done this sooner? <nl> Of course, even the evil of the world can become boring. Everything can become boring. Why hadn't Sydney seen that at a younger age? <nl> She didn't ever come to enjoy the actual act of killing. The lust for righteousness, maybe, but never the act. Three years in and she was done with it too. <nl> It wasn't the right way. The right way was to instill a system that wouldn't have allowed them to get away with their crimes in the first place. <nl> You likely understand where this story is going now. Or why I have to tell it in muted whispers when the enforcers aren't around to hear. She never really meant any harm. To any adult who'd studied any degree of history, her path was predictable. But she'd only been a child. And life is hard for a child. School and peers, it's hard to see the forest for the trees. <nl> I hope that, amid this story, you've had some ideas for how to move forward, how to save us from the tyrannical rule of our benevolent dictator. <nl> I'm out of time for the rest of her story. Her rise to power. How that all went down. Perhaps another time, but the enforcers are returning shortly. <nl> If you've heard enough, please send help. <nl> Sydney may, at heart, still be a child worth saving. Perhaps she's nothing more than wicked and blighted. Maybe she's just confused and yearning for something to fulfill her. <nl> But she's also something so much worse than all that. <nl> She's perfect. <nl> ___ <nl> Read more stories at [r/TalesByOpheliaCyanide](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesByOpheliaCyanide/) <eos>

<sos> Danya Trellwright was perpetually short-changed. Currently in her jean pocket she had PS29 of Mortal money... and precisely zero in the currency she needed to settle her debts. Her next pay day - again, Mortal money - wasn't for a fortnight, which put her in the ridiculous position of having to live off scraps and turn off her heating for the upcoming Winter nights. She'd have once deemed such hand-to-mouth hardship impossible for a graduate of the Royal Warlock's Conservatoire. Now she knew better. <nl> Danya hated to reflect on that blasted degree. It turned out that studying 'the Origin of Incantations' didn't afford one the time to master the actual incantations themselves. She could tell you all about the 1854 feud between Grilby Dockervitch and Thelma Tchlabakan and the consequent blinding charm that arose from such a legendary duel... but could she cast similar shadows over men's eyes for even a second? Not a chance in hell. <nl> She was therefore feeling decidedly sorry for herself. Picking up part-time jobs alongside the Mortals; a call centre role that involved more apology than it did selling, a stint in a bar pouring pints with too much foam. Her degree had led to only a couple of Wizarding roles; both low-paid cash-in-hand jobs teaching 'the theory of incantations' to rich Warlock offspring. These stints as private tutor had both ended prematurely when the children scoffed at the lessons for being meaningless. They wanted to learn actual magic. She couldn't blame them. <nl> Still, there was one silver lining in all this: her days scrubbing toilets and waiting tables amongst the Mortals had given her an insight to their world that few wizards cared to concern themselves with. She could conceal herself amongst the Mortals like she was one of them; she could dress like them, talk like them, pretend to engross herself in their technology and media, pretend that it mattered to her. Her Mortal disguise was so convincing that it enabled her to slip into their world; out of the wizard community and the formidable cloaked Dept Collectors that roamed it. <nl> She sat now in her flat in Hackney, sandwiched between identical flats occupied by builders, sales clerks and nurses. She thought it would be impossible to track her down here, so camouflaged like this. But the Dept Collectors of the Wizard world were shrewd. They'd invested their own university time more wisely. And now one of them stood before her in all his cloaked and powerful glory. <nl> "Did anybody see you?" Denya asked. <nl> Funny, she'd only been living here a few months but she'd already inherited the Mortal's collective obsession for keeping up appearances. She hated to think what the neighbours would say about her visitor's unusual attire. She'd be branded some devil worshiper or something. <nl> "I've come for what we're owed." <nl> Denya scoffed. "Look around, Marius. Does it look like I have that kinda cash?!" <nl> Marius's eyes raked over the flat's interior, not bothering to hide his contempt. There were ashtrays, inspirational fridge magnets, television guides, scented candles. All the clutter that Mortal's accumulated that were unfathomable to the Wizarding kind. <nl> "You bring shame on your University." he hissed. <nl> "Yeah, well, I don't care much about what they think anymore." <nl> "Perhaps you should. They'll deploy more Collectors the longer you evade your dept. And believe me, the others will have far less tolerance for such... life choices." <nl> "Choices?! I didn't make a choice. I got scammed into a shitty degree with no prospects to follow." <nl> "Oh please." <nl> "I spent three years in that damn place, watching others hex and curse and charm and what did I learn, huh?! A bunch of ancient history. Fat lot of good that'll do me." <nl> Marius's lips folded into a smirk. "You think the Collectors are interested in your self-pity?! You took out a loan, you pay it back." <nl> "Tell them they'll get it when I get something worthwhile in return." <nl> "You are a fool!" He spat. His face was contorted with anger now... most unusual for someone in a Collector's role, where poise and inscrutability were part of the job criteria. But Marius appeared to have lost himself; beneath those velvet robes he was shaking, fists clenched. <nl> "You think it's on Wizarding kind to provide you a life?!" He demanded, "You think those imbeciles with their tickle hexes and fire-breathing charms were carried and dumped into positions of success straight out of graduation?! No. It's not what you learn, girl, it's what you do with it. And that's on you." <nl> "And what am I supposed to do with a bunch of old stories?!" <nl> "I was on the panel for your enrolment." Marius proclaimed. "I was one of many that advocated for your acceptance into the university. You showed great promise. And modesty. That modesty was rare. But perhaps it wasn't modesty at all... just pure, simple denseness." <nl> "Look!" Denya snapped, "I don't have your money so maybe you should---" <nl> "You really don't know? The extent of your power?" <nl> Denya wasn't in the mood for this. She'd just done a 9 hour shift on tired blistered feet, pouring coffee for jeering men who'd called her 'bruv' and 'geezer', slapped her hard on the shoulders in what had to be the Mortal display of domination. She'd have done anything to have turned around and cursed those Mortal cretins... but she'd refilled their mugs instead. She certainly didn't need Marius here now forcing her to re-live such obvious failure. <nl> "We guided you towards 'The Origin in Incantations' because we felt you hardly had need for those other subjects," Marius whispered, "A gift like yours... no blindness or concealment charms would have put you in better stead, but learning from history certainly would." <nl> "I don't know what you're talking about." <nl> "Look in the mirror, Denya." <nl> Denya didn't own a mirror. She didn't need to look at her own tired and disappointed face each day. She didn't need to be reminded that the incantations uttered into the reflection rendered no results. <nl> But Marius, in his brilliance, swiped his hand across the air like brushing fingertips on an invisible window. Where his fingers trailed now hovered a shimmering reflection too tantalising for Denya to turn away from. <nl> She edged close to it... and where she expected her own face to look back at her, she saw only his. <nl> "You can shape-shift Denya." Marius said this with zero pride, just disappointment that his target had been so obtuse to have never picked up on it for herself, "You can shift into people you despise, or people you want to be or...... into Mortals, apparently. You've never bothered to channel and discipline your gift, so who knows exactly how it works. But it is exceptionally rare." <nl> Denya continued staring. She touched the tip of her finger to her face... in the reflection, it was Marius's older, wrinkled hand that tapped to sharper cheeks. <nl> "How has nobody ever told me this?" She breathed. <nl> "Because you were admitted to a university, not a nursery. You took course after course on the greatest shape-shifters of the Wizarding world, absorbed all of their triumphs and failings, scored highly in your essays and never once did it occur to you......" <nl> He trailed off, disgusted. <nl> Denya swiped a tongue across her - or Marius's - lips. She tasted blood. She'd never read anything about shape-shifters accessing their counterpart's tastes, smells or sensations before. She mentally logged it in the back of her mind. For now she had to concentre on not having *her* blood ravished next. <nl> "And why are you telling me all this?" She asked. <nl> Marius dragged his eyes across the flat again, eyebrow cocked. <nl> "Because you clearly have no money. But I'm going to keep coming after you, Danya, and next time I do - I'd like it to be a little more interesting." <nl> Then he jerked his head so fast in made Denya jump; his neck cracking grotesquely, his body shuddering, before he shifted into a smaller, balding Wizard that Denya recognised as the faculty administrator, Dustin. <nl> "Perhaps," mused Marius... or Dustin... "Once your debt is paid, you might consider becoming a Collector yourself." <eos>

<sos> "Wait until they get that specialist down here. The whole place is contaminated," Garth said, as he was putting up the warning signs and taping off the area. He wore the required safety equipment on all his 8 tentacles, and he moved with a brisk efficiency. <nl> "What do you mean? What happened?" asked Thrace. He was careful to not come any closer. His more leggy near mammalian form looked ready to spring backwards. His elongated ears popped up in alarm. <nl> "There is a biocontaminant in the science lab. It would be too hazardous for anyone to go in, but they just hired on a specialist that is especially immune to most biocontaminants," Garth explained. <nl> "Like a hazmat specialist?" Thrace asked. <nl> "No. Like a human. You'll see, she's on her way down now," Garth said with a snort. <nl> True to his word, there was the sound of something coming down the hall. Step, step, thud. Step, Step, thud. <nl> Slowly, an elderly human woman came into view. <nl> Thrace's ears swiveled in her direction, and he looked incredulously back at Garth and hissed, "That human is ancient!" <nl> Garth tried to organize his tentacles in a gesture Thrace would understand to silence him, but it was too late. <nl> "I may be ancient, but my hearings still good," she said with a laugh as she slowly moved down the hallway. She took two steps in her comfortable shoes, then moved her walker forward with a soft thud, then took two more steps. <nl> Garth waved a tentacle and said, "We have detected high levels of salmonella contamination in the lab. We think it's localized to one of the benches, Deb." <nl> "Alright, alright," the elderly woman said. <nl> "How are you sending an elderly being in there with those levels of contamination?" Thrace said, almost shaking with concern. <nl> "Oh, don't worry about me, honey," Deb said. She patted the tall slender creature as she walked by. "I took this job for the benefits. I get paid very well to live here on the station, and every once in a while when the scientists leave something out, I go and put it away." <nl> Deb made her way past Garth, who curiously held the door for her, as she slowly made her way into the science lab. <nl> Inside, the elderly woman could see exactly what was tripping the sensors. An earth chicken was set out for study, and had been left out on the counter for some reason. <nl> Deb reached down into her walker bag, and pulled out a bright neon green hazmat containment bag, and deftly put the small tray inside it, sealing the bag. She then pulled out a sensor and looked to see if that took care of it. It tweeted an all clear. <nl> "Welp, that takes care of that. It's all sealed here for disposal. I'm gonna head back to my apartment and watch my shows," she said. She waved the sensor over the newly sealed dead chicken to ensure it was safe for Garth, and she slowly made her way back out. <nl> Garth came in with his own sensor device, and waved his tentacles in happiness, "Thanks Deb. We really appreciate it!" <nl> After the elderly human had made her way out, Thrace poked his head in, "I don't understand. You paid that human to just put something in a bag?" <nl> "Yes. She's worth ten times her salary. Without her, we'd have to shut down the lab, get a fully suited up decontamination team in, and if any of us hadn't been suited up, that would probably had killed us," Garth said emphatically. <nl> "She's old, but nice. She makes us cookies. She also is practically unkillable. Human immune systems are amazing, and the older they are, the more they've been exposed to. That means she's even more immune, I guess. I'm not a scientist," Garth explained. <nl> Thrace just turned to look down the hall to watch the elderly human go, "I guess they just don't look that unkillable." <eos>

<sos> "The key question is--why?" <nl> We stared blankly at the slide in question, and our enthusiastic professor who had just paused for dramatic effect. A barely-stifled yawn quickly broke the atmosphere, but to her credit, Professor Crawford barely missed a beat before seguing into her intended outcome. <nl> "We're not sure why," she said brightly, a radiant smile on her face. <nl> Groans and clicking tongues quickly became the dominant sound in the room, but Professor Crawford forged on undeterred. <nl> "If it makes a human sick, it will kill you," she continued. "Even before we were capable of faster-than-light travel, it was an often repeated phase around civilizations, so much so that we've found evidence of it dating back millennia ago. Imagine that--our ancestors, still carving words on stone, and other races were already utilizing instantaneous communication to talk about us." <nl> I raised my hand. Perhaps it was a mistake, considering Professor Crawford's tendency to eagerly espouse her lessons even without any external input. I could feel a few pairs of eyes turn towards me, but I tried to ignore them, mostly unsuccessfully. <nl> "What about the recent pandemic? A century ago?" <nl> "Ah, that," Professor Crawford pushed up her glasses, nodding knowingly. "It was certainly devastating to our population. We still feel the effect even until today, don't we. Hence, your seating arrangements. And to prevent cheating on your tests, of course." <nl> "See," she continued. "Yes, it was a bad pandemic. But it was hardly unprecedented, seeing to our history, and our race survived. If you read the excellent book *The Death of my People*by Jordan Klukx, one of the few surviving members of the Furoskim race, he details the excruciating death tolls of his planet, caused by what we know as the common flu." <nl> A well-timed sneeze broke the flow of conversation. Professor Crawford looked disapprovingly past me, and swiftly indicated for the offending person to put on a mask. A muffled 'sorry' was then heard, and we turned back to the teacher. <nl> "It's strange, isn't it?" she asked. "Whether it's through our sheer reproductive powers, or some sort of quirk with our immune system, or our general empathy--humans survive and continue. We've just entered year 3020, and if centuries past have taught us anything, it's that we are due for another round of airborne coronavirus soon. You young ones are still in your first hundred or so years, so it likely won't hit you as hard... but spare a thought for us centenarians, eh?" <nl> --- <nl> r/dexdrafts <eos>

<sos> "How are you feeling today, Miss Comet? You were rather burnt-out last time I spoke to you. Have things improved much?" I lounged into my chair, ready for a story. I could just tell tonight would be a long night. She seemed ready to burst into flames, anger boiling within her core, yet she held her composure. Sitting down in a stiff wooden chair I had placed for my guests. <nl> "Horrible. Burnt out doesn't even describe the feeling anymore. I feel empty. How does a lady that catches on fire ever feel burnt out? Ugh. I sometimes envy you. You are one of the few people not caught up in this hero rat race. A normal person in a world of freaks." She sighed, pulling off her mask, blonde curls following as she discarded the mask. <nl> "Heh, burnt out. I didn't even notice the joke at first. I think you are developing a sense of humor, Miss Comet. You are wrong though, in a world where heroes are normal, I'm the freak. The person who goes against the norm is the people considered the freak. Have you considered a holiday?" <nl> "A holiday in this city? With the amount of villains? You must be dreaming. I wish I could lay my head down, but if I did, it would be at the cost of lives." Comet dragged her fingers through her hair, foot tapping quickly against the floor, skin burning as if it was about to catch alight, only to dim a moment later. <nl> "Easy, I know its hard for you, but burning down my home won't help you. You don't owe the people out there anything. If you take time off, another hero will fill in. There's plenty of you around, I'm sure you will be fine. Last I heard you outnumber the villains three to one.  Those are good odds." I couldn't help but find some amusement in her stress. Seeing the hero on the verge of a breakdown was fun to watch. Made me feel a lot better about my condition. <nl> "Sure, there are plenty of heroes. I just know I would blame myself if something were to happen while I was away. I swore an oath to protect this-" <nl> "Protect this city. Yes, the same oath that every person who comes here took. The oath is little more than a childish way to secure your loyalty. It's the equivalent of making you write your name before giving you your pen license. Something meaningless. At the end of the day, if you keep this up, you might not have the will to shine anymore." <nl> Miss Comet looked agitated, my words lighting a fire in her. She went to stand, only to pause, placing herself back in the seat. She collected her mask, placing it back over her head. "You're somewhat right. I don't completely agree with you, but I understand where you are coming from. Not taking time off will hurt my heroic feats in the long-term. Maybe a break would help me. Then I could come back refreshed. A week or two of no pesky people screaming for help would be lovely." Miss Comet slouched back, looking as though she was visualizing her holiday, a smile creeping onto her lips. <nl> "I think that's a great idea. Hopefully, that helped you ease your mind a little." As much as I enjoyed seeing heroes frustrated, I had many others to go through tonight, not wanting to spend all night with Miss Comet. <nl> "Yeah, thanks for the help. You might not have powers, but you sure save a lot of us heroes. I think I'll book one for next Monday." With that she got up, giving me a wave before leaving through my window. <nl> I waited until she was out of sight, heading towards my phone, making a note of what she had told me. I'm sure a villain would pay handsomely to find out when one of the heroes was going to be away. It would make it easier for them to commit their crimes in her region. Maybe I could see if Stunner would be interested? I would give him a good discount. <nl> Before I could make any phonecalls, another hero knocked on my door. I hit the voice record button on my phone before sliding it into my pocket, moving to answer the door. <nl> &nbsp; <nl> &nbsp; <nl> &nbsp; <nl> (If you enjoyed this feel free to check out my subreddit /r/Sadnesslaughs where I'll be posting more of my writing.) <eos>

<sos> Cara gulped as she walked across the corridors and cubicles. She kept staring in different directions. Sweat formed on her forehead. She was scared of what would happen next. Cara was the new intern in the office and she yet had to have an encounter with the infamous Mr. Blackfury. <nl> She had heard stories about him. The only dwarf in New York that lived worked in a building taller than 50 metres. He had quite the reputation as well. His face was said to be permanently contorted into a scowl and he was known for fits of anger while on the phone. <nl> Now that she was standing in front of the glass walls seperating his office from the other. They were draped so that no one could see inside. She could hear muffled shouting coming from the inside. Cara took a deep breath before she decided to open the door. <nl> Inside she found a dwarf sitting on a hilariously oversized swivel chair made from finest leathers in front of a mahogany desk. He was holding a telephone receiver in his hand, shouting obscenities from multiple languages into it. <nl> "I am telling you Fiorac, you will regret to not listening to me! No, no YOU listen to ME. I'm the broker here! I know my stuff Fiorac. I am telling you, the stock will go up. Yes, I saw the report. No I don't believe that dimwit. Stop bringing him up Fiorac, we both he's an idiot. Why do you keep defending him? Time and time again I've saved your pansy ass from being fucked by his predictions. Yes I goddamn you're capable of making your own decisions, but I'm telling you it's a stupid fucking plan. If you listen to him you'll have cash, but you might miss out on this opportunity to quintuple your investment. Okay, let's bargain here, what if you just keep some of the stock so you'll still make a profit..." <nl> On and on it went for 15 minutes. Not once did Mr. Blackfury look up from his phone. Cara just stood in the doorway, unsure what to make of this situation. An elf might have realized that this "Fiorac" client would not listen to them and would've given up. But not Grorric. Finally he concluded the call with "you won't regret this". As he set down the phone he finally seemed to register that Cara was in the room. <nl> "What're ye doing there? If you've got business with me speak or go." <nl> "Y- y- yes Mr Blackfury. It's about my quarterly review." <nl> "Well why do ye just stand there? Sit down!" <nl> Her boss studied her with a scorn as she found herself a seat. <nl> "Name?" <nl> "Uh, C- C- Cara Feinh." <nl> "Stop stuttering, I dinnae understand a thing ye said. <nl> "Cara Feinh, sir." <nl> "Ah yes, here's yer file." <nl> Cara shuffled around, grabbing her knees in anticipation of what her boss would say. This was her third job at a brokerage. She started to regret having spent two decades studying economics. <nl> "Miss Feinh, if I can call ye that, how old are ye again?" <nl> "Uh, I just turned 85." <nl> "Aye, so ye're fresh outta school aren't ye?" <nl> "Y- yes sir" <nl> "Ok, so lemme ask ye another question: What do you do if a client doesn't want what you're selling?" <nl> "W- well if they say no I try to be reasonable, u- unless their being unreasonable that is." <nl> "So ye just accept that? Lemme let ye into a secret. How long were ye listenin' tah me, laddie?" <nl> "A c- c- couple of minutes. Why?" <nl> "Do you know how often that client told me no? Fifteen times. And yah know why I didn't  stop? 'Cause I'm a dwarf and we dwarfs are stubborn. Don't accept no Cara or yah won't be with us any longer. Now leave, 'cause I've got five other clients tah save from their stupidity." <nl> Cara awkwardly stumbled out of the office, after being shoved by a surprising amount of force for a man so small. And as she walked back to her cubicle, she felt excited to try out her new trick. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> 'Tis my first reply here, so feel free to criticize me. <eos>

<sos> Of all of them I disliked the priest the most, though I can admit that was more due to my own prejudices. In my years on the road I had little use for the gods, particularly then and particularly with that party. If I had I might have thought they had cursed me after all. Their names were Aaron and Aelia, Ulago and Xanthippus, and they came to me in pairs that had more to do with accidents at the guild hall than any kind of personal friendships. Still though, we made a strange group, and more than once I joked that the guild had decided I had taken too many bounties, that they'd turned me into some sort of welfare program. <nl> And for a while that rang true, until we realized that their talents were better suited to crime than warfare. <nl> It started late one night with Aaron and Ulago, our thief and warrior. Quite honestly Aaron was a bumbling fool in every aspect of the physical realm, although to hear him tell it he had been a great acrobat in his youth. Nearing seventy now he'd have broken a bone if he tried to turn a cartwheel and the deft motions of cutting a purse were beyond him, but if there was a heist or a scheme he'd seen it or invented it, and he could scout talent with the best of them. Ulago, for his part, was less a warrior than a dancer. He fought with a matched pair of short swords, and at the school where he'd been trained they spoke of perfect defense, of learning your opponent through every twitch of his muscles and every flick of his eyes, all in the pursuit of one beautiful stroke of the blade. <nl> They sat hunched by the fire that night, deep into their cups and speaking in hushed voices, making such frequent glances across the flames at Aelia that finally she sprang to her feet. Dark magic had begun to gather at her fingertips, and a furious blush had risen to her face. She only had three spells she could cast every 24 hours and she had decided their disrespect was worth one. <nl> "No, no, no!" Ulago had said, leaping up as well. "It's not like that I swear!" <nl> "Then why do you keep looking?" she said angrily, "shall I teleport you back to town? I recall an inn there where the barmaids had standards that might even fall to you." <nl> I couldn't help myself, the brief snort of a laugh escaped me. <nl> "You too Devin?" she called. "If you both scrape your gold together you might even have enough." <nl> I merely shook my head, that was an idle threat. This far from town there was no way she could reach it. Ulago, however bravely decided to continue on. <nl> "I swear we meant no disrespect. Rather, Aaron and I had an idea. None of us are making any money out here," he gestured broadly with his arms, walking closer to the fire so the light would hit him just right. "Pickings are slim in this region and none are falling to us. There's not a more mismatched bunch of souls this side of the Kingdom, and if the other one can match us it's only because those poor sods of Easterners were born with the brains of a cow and the courage of a fowl. To compete against men such as that would be unfair." He eyed Aelia for a second, seeming to notice the magic that still clung to her fingers. "And women," he added. <nl> "What our long winded comrade is trying to say," Aaron interjected, "is that we're shit at this and it's time to look elsewhere. I propose burglary." <nl> All eyes whipped themselves to the old man now, and his long, thin smile was full with the knowledge of it. <nl> "I know the marks and I know the fences, and Ulago here can buy us as much time as we'd ever need if they have guards. As to why we were looking at you though, well my dear, much of this will hinge on you." <nl> "On me?" Aelia's magic had faded now and she had taken several halting steps around the fire. Her eyes were wide and I began to realize for the first time just how young she was. <nl> "Oh yes," Aaron said, "on you. As a mage you're nothing special really, but I've seen you run, you're quick as all hell. I'll teach you all you need to know about picking locks and finding treasures, it's up to you to be my hands. You get into a house, find the two most valuable items and teleport them out to us, then just run out." <nl> "Two?" she questioned, "but I have three casts and I can't teleport myself." <nl> "Two. I have a spell in mind for you to learn, an old friend of mine in Harrowvale knows it and we're only a few days ride away. My dear, have you ever heard of Shadow Step?" <nl> So it transpired that our party left that roadside firepit and found ourselves in Harrowvale some days later. We scraped together the scraps of our gold, enrolled Aelia in an old mage's tutelage, and a week later she came out with a new trick that would have been utterly useless to her in her previous career as a battlemage but which would soon prove to be our bread and butter. <nl> Our first theft came the very next day. We gathered at dusk in the city's narrow alleys only a few minutes from some lordling's manor and Aaron briefed us on what would come. <nl> "Aelia," he began, "the plan rests on you. You will pick the lock on the cellar door and enter the house through there, use my number two pick, the locks bought by lower nobility tend to be all advertising and little actual substance. Once inside you will proceed to the lord's bedroom, find his largest chest and his most expensive looking item and teleport them both to this spot. Ulago, you will approach the guards at the front gate as if you are drunk and then challenge their captain to a duel. Devin you go with him and the pair of you will insult the man until he accepts, cause the biggest distraction you can and then do what you will. I'll wait here and receive the goods." <nl> "And I?" Xanthippus the priest asked. <nl> Aaron squinted at him as if he'd forgotten the man was there. "Pray or something, you're as useless as tits on a bull." <nl> With a soft laugh and a newly learned word of power Aelia gathered the shadows of the alley around herself and walked towards the building as silently as the night. <nl> To say that our first theft went perfectly would be a lie, although I said that and more many times over. Aelia, with only a few days practice with the lockpicks had been forced to finally give up and simply melted the lock with a spell instead. That left her with only one teleport and the chest we got in the end turned out to be the lordling's mistress's smallclothes, although the price they fetched was surprisingly high. <nl> Ulago was a wonder and likely the only flawless part of the plan. He fought the guard captain to exhaustion and then simply walked off laughing, I sketched a quick bow and followed him, my notebook in hand. <nl> Whatever god Xanthippus prayed to at least refrained from cursing us further. <nl> We improved with every heist however, and soon we found crime was in fact more profitable than adventuring, whatever the guild said about the matter be damned. <nl> And my part in this? After all I had no sleight of hand, no skill with a blade. In fact my own riches prior to their joining me were entirely fabricated, which they had been sorely angered to find out. We had the wisest thief, the fastest wizard, the smartest warrior, and the most useless priest, but we also had me, a plain and simple bard. <nl> But a damned good one. <nl> They fought and stole and prayed, and all the while I sang. Sang us all into myth and legend the length and breadth of the Kingdom, even in the blighted East. Even when our heists turned out to be a lady's smallclothes and the stagelights burned a little too bright I turned them all into a roving band of misbegotten folk heroes, and slowly party members became friends, and friends became family. A family that was a damned sight richer on the wrong side of the law than the right one, even if we had to drag along the useless mouth of the priest. <nl> \---------- <nl> If you enjoyed that I've got a ton more over at r/TurningtoWords.

<sos> Death was a young woman with raven black hair and a beauty that had never quite had time to blossom. She was a girl whose motions refused to be defined, alternating between a perfect flowing gracefulness and shocking suddenness seemingly at random. She was also heartbroken as she walked through the forest that day. In moods like these everything seemed to shrink away from her; flowers shivered at her approach, trees strained at their roots as if they could run. She only had the handmaiden at her side and even that had started off wrong. <nl> "Elle," she said, turning to the girl. "Why don't they understand?" It was a difficult question, too broad to have any real answer and she knew it. In the distance they could both hear the villager's chants. It was a holy day, a harvest festival dedicated to the God of Life and his gifts. <nl> "Because they can't," Elle said simply. "I was like them when we met, remember? I was terrified of you for nearly a year after my sacrifice, I blamed you for taking every good thing in my life away. It's natural for mortals, we have so little time that we want to make the most of it, measured like that your brother the God of Life was always going to be more popular." <nl> "I know that!" Death hissed, resuming her walk and wishing she could get far enough away from the village not to hear. That was impossible on a day like today though, there was still work ahead. "But still, not one of them sees! Not one! They all believe they have souls, believe that there's a world beyond their mortal plane, but yet they still can't see my gift for what it is!" <nl> Elle caught up to her, grabbing Death's arm to stop her. "Maybe that's an important part of it. I know we've been through this before but humor me, what do you think your gift is? What is death to its goddess?" <nl> Death paused, lowering her head. Her hair fell in a great cascade across her face, every muscle in her body tensing. This was the very core of her being, even saying the words made her feel exposed. <nl> "Death is the validation of life," she said. "Its what gives a life meaning and hope and joy, it makes every experience in it matter. Without death life would become a curse and my brother would be feared as I am. And beyond that, it's...it's..." she struggled for the words now, the goddess had been alone a very long time before she met Elle. <nl> "It's the beginning of a second life. And then a third, and a fourth. The spirits live on and return back into the cycle, binding the world together, making us all whole. Except for you, I'm sorry for that." <nl> "I'm not," Elle said, and Death didn't have to see her handmaid's face to know she was smiling. Elle stroked arm gently and then moved away, her bare feet almost silent on the grass. Glancing up through the curtain of her hair Death saw her crouch down and pick something. Elle came back slowly and as she approached Death heard a small wailing sound, catching a familiar, almost cloyingly sweet scent. She'd picked a deathbell. <nl> "I saw this in the bushes, I always thought they were beautiful, even when I was alive." <nl> "That's rare for mortals, most people are too afraid of my symbols." <nl> Elle laughed, standing in front of her goddess again. "When I was six I once braided them into my hair. I'd found a whole stand of them near the village graveyard and thought they made me the prettiest girl in all the land." Reaching up she began to comb her fingers through the goddess's long dark hair. She gently weaved the flower in, its purple and black petals barely showing in that ocean of night. <nl> "I'm sure you were," Death said softly, enjoying the feeling. "They may be my flowers but they suit your colors better." <nl> "Oh I don't know, I love them on you." Finishing her work Elle cupped a hand under the goddess's chin, drawing her gaze up and brushing her hair back behind her ear. <nl> Death smiled. It was a strange and rare thing, like the rise of the full moon, and she cherished every opportunity she got to do it. There had been precious few before her handmaiden, her friend, had arrived. <nl> Elle's right hand moved to her cheek, the left to her waist, and when the taller woman leaned down Death closed her eyes and gave herself over to the moment. <nl> In the distance the villagers still sang, but as Death's mood changed the trees seemed to lean back in and the flower in her hair stopped wailing. <nl> \---------- <nl> If you enjoyed that I've got tons more over at r/TurningtoWords.

<sos> The goddess Mania and I stood, side by side, at the bedside of a dying woman in a hospital, friends and family by her side. I had long ago given up coaxing her back to the underworld. She felt her place was surrounded by death, despite the fact that it depressed her so deeply. <nl> Mania didn't even *need* to be here. Her sister Libitina was the one that was the goddess of burials, and spent most of her time funeral-hopping, and Dea Tacita could often be found in the morgue, watching over the dead, their corpses being her domain. But Mania insisted on surrounding herself with death, and even after thousands of years of it bringing her sadness, she persisted in it. <nl> Once the woman had passed on, we wandered out into the hallway and Mania sat in a chair a waiting room we passed, prompting me to take the seat next to her. "Did that family seem at peace?" she asked, leaning back tiredly in the chair. <nl> That was one of her more common questions to me. At first, I found them strange, but now I found them par for the course. "That woman's death was a long time coming, so I feel they were," I answered. "How are you feeling today?" <nl> "Mm. Same as usual." <nl> That meant mildly depressed. 'All right' meant just that, an average mood, somewhat thoughtful and pensive. 'Horrible' meant she was feeling burdened by the misery of those who had attended the funerals we'd gone to or those who'd witnessed their loved ones die before their time. Or worse, those who had witnessed the results of a violent, brutal death, or even the death itself. <nl> The worst was when I got no response at all. That meant Mania was lost in a churning whirlpool of her despondent thoughts, and I would need to put more effort into drawing her out. She would sometimes return to the underworld, though never at my urging, only to curl up in bed in a state of depression that she couldn't be pulled from, that she just needed to make her way through mentally on her own. <nl> But I had a new plan today. It was the culmination of research I'd been doing in my off hours (even Mania had to report back to Pluto, and that could take a while) for a few weeks now. It was difficult to say how it would go, but I'd tried various strategies over the years for helping my goddess through her difficult existence, and I wasn't about to give up now. <nl> "We have a funeral next," I told her. "I'd like to go now, if that's all right by you. So we're not late." <nl> "Sure. Is it a well-known figure?" she asked, pushing herself to her feet with me. <nl> "Not quite. But I wanted to arrive with plenty of time to spend there." <nl> I opened a portal in front of us, allowing her through first, and I followed, closing it behind us. We'd arrived in a large room, similar to so many others we'd visited over the years, used for funeral wakes. And I looked over to Mania, whose gaze slid over the people in the room, our presence, as always, invisible to them. <nl> "I...don't understand," she said, glancing to me with confused, narrowed eyes. "They seem...happy." <nl> And they were. Nenia Dea, the goddess of funerals, had tipped me off to this one. As experiments go for cheering up Mania, this was definitely a new one. <nl> "An increasing number of humans are starting to take death in stride, or go even further, and partake in what they're calling a 'celebration of life'," I said, a subdued smile on my face. <nl> Mania shook her head suddenly at that. "Then we shouldn't be here. This is the domain of Thesan or Artume-" <nl> "No, this is a wake," I said firmly. "They are here because of a death. That is your domain, is it not?" <nl> The goddess didn't reply, continuing to look around the room curiously and eventually started to mingle, and I followed. <nl> There was a slideshow of photos of the deceased playing on two flatscreen televisions up in the corners of the room for everyone to see, but that was common. Less common was the fact that Monty Python's Always Look on the Bright Side of Life played from the speakers as people happily chatted about the life of the deceased, a man named Bailey Hammond. <nl> We overheard a story nearby of the man's son recounting something his father had said about shutting his eyes while on a bicycle, unsurprisingly landing him in the hospital in a leg cast. Another had been a student of the deceased and was talking excitedly with classmates about the field of research they were pursuing, explaining how Hammond always made class interesting. <nl> The coffin was most surprising, to us. It seemed Hammond was a big fan of a certain sports team, as instead of the typical black suit, his burial clothes were something he would have worn to a football game. Not only that, but his casket was the colors of the team, a cheerful red and white rather than the typical somber dark brown wood. <nl> "Death is an end," I spoke up, as we took a respite in the corner of the room, away from the chattering friends and family, "but it is a necessary end. You don't mourn the end of a party; you reflect on how much enjoyment it brought you. Similarly, humans have started to take on this attitude with their lives. Of course, the more religious think it disrespectful, as the upcoming afterlife is what a funeral should be about to them, but so many humans have become secular that this was an inevitable outcome." <nl> "It is...pleasing," Mania said softly, her gaze going from one human to the next. "They are all sad, of course, I can sense it, and yet there's an undeniable joy they're expressing of the appreciation of having this person in their lives." <nl> "And they couldn't have had this day together without Bailey Hammond's death," I said. "He's left them, yes, but they still have countless wonderful memories, and it seems the man's wishes were that they came together in a celebration and appreciation of the time they'd had with him. In laughter rather than in tears. There are so many who aren't fortunate enough to experience nearly as many years, and while making his wishes known before his time came, he must have known that and understood how lucky he was." <nl> As I stood there, friend and therapist to a goddess, I felt the satisfaction of a job well done as I always did, but more than that, I felt something new. There was a small smile on Mania's face, and as someone who spent their days constantly among death, there was an emotion in me that I rarely experienced. Hope. And I looked forward to helping my goddess through this next change in the way humans experienced death. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> /r/storiesbykaren <eos>

<sos> The man, with his crown and cloak, glowered down at the small adventurer. She was the only one of her  party still standing, keeping herself between the corrupted lord and her friends.  The group's best healer crouched near their best swordsperson, her fingers glittering with magic as she tried to heal a wound. <nl> "You should have taken the chance to leave when I offered,"  he said, his words coming easily, as if the fight had taken nothing from him. " You can't win. You know you'll die here, like every other before you." <nl> "Really," the young adventurer panted. She held her broken sword--the tip shorn clean off-- tightly. "I wouldn't be so sure of that, Makbit." <nl> Makbit laughed. "You would not be sure? You mean you came here, to what, to slay me, knowing nothing? I have the crystal sword, I have the castle's forces, I have prophecy, and you have ... gods and seers all, a knight with the paint still wet on their shield and a cleric still in school?" <nl> "Two clerics actually," she answered, getting her breath back and indicating the badge on her breast. "And a Raccoon, though I think she's in your woods."This time it wasn't even a proper evil laugh, more of a snort."Also you don't have the prophecy. I do." <nl> That stopped the giggling cold. " Excuse me?" <nl> "No Man shall defeat you," the young cleric said, patiently. "Right?" <nl> "Oh, and you think that because you're of the fairer sex, you'll have a loophole? Your little magling couldn't land a strike, and neither will you." The crystal sword gleamed in his hand, charged with dark fire. <nl> "Of course Annie couldn't. She's human." The little gnome grinned, teeth sharp as her broken sword lit with fire of its own.  "I'm Ann. You really should have gotten your prophecy in writing." <nl> Her sword bit deep, and his dropped to the ground. <eos>
