< sos > ProtagonistA I learned ProtagonistA's name through the phonebook , my shaking fingers carefully caressing its pages as I searched for the address I 'd seen ProtagonistA at so many times . 43 Mako Drive , the small , brick house on the corner of Braxton and Mako . I 'd memorized the shape of ProtagonistA's home weeks before , my bare feet sliding across its wet grass every time I closed my eyes . Letters from ProtagonistA's mailbox , addressed to ProtagonistA , confirmed what the book claimed . < nl > ProtagonistA was perfect , absolutely flawless in every way . I 'd watched ProtagonistA for seven months -- almost every single day and night -- silently following ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA strolled to and from ProtagonistA's classes . Sometimes I stayed outside ProtagonistA's bedroom window as we slept , my heart racing as I matched my breathing to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA never knew I was there , never acknowledged me as more than the distant shadow of a faceless tree , but I knew ProtagonistA needed me . ProtagonistA was all I could think about , all I wanted to be with . Beautiful , flawless , ideal . If anything could convince me that angels truly visited this greasy , obscene , vile planet , then it would have been to see ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistA was an artist , a creator ; ProtagonistA built perfect worlds that only ProtagonistA and I could appreciate , universes fit for the two of us . ProtagonistA taught ProtagonistA's art at the community center next to the unsightly yellow pizza restaurant . I did n't understand why ProtagonistA bothered showing up . The students did n't respect ProtagonistA ; the other teachers did n't understand ProtagonistA ; no one truly valued ProtagonistA . They could n't see ProtagonistA's perfection , ProtagonistA's talent , the unearthly skill ProtagonistA possessed . No one knew what ProtagonistA was worth -- except me . It was clear to me , everything ProtagonistA was capable of . The world was n't able to comprehend what ProtagonistA could do ; only I , and the God above , could fathom such beauty . I knew I had to free ProtagonistA , to save ProtagonistA from the life of dismay and disrespect ProtagonistA endured . ProtagonistA's perfection had to be known . < nl > ProtagonistA always walked alone , always spent ProtagonistA's days and nights with a just paintbrush and canvas . The mail at 43 Mako Drive was never addressed to anyone but ProtagonistA , my fingers becoming accustomed to the rub of the ink - stained C of ProtagonistA's name pressed into ProtagonistA's envelopes . ProtagonistA had no one but ProtagonistA's art , nothing but the worlds ProtagonistA created in the comfort of ProtagonistA's home as I silently watched under the shroud of the long - set sun . ProtagonistA had me , had my support and devotion , my undying love and admiration , yet I knew that was n't enough for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA needed more , needed the embrace of the planet as they all screamed ProtagonistA's name in singularity , hung ProtagonistA's portraits in galleries and travelled halfway around the world to admire ProtagonistA's brush strokes . ProtagonistA needed fame and fortune , acclaim and respect , followers and immorality . I knew I could give that to ProtagonistA , make ProtagonistA name a commodity and brand us as a single entity in the history of humanity . < nl > I wanted to be the one to launch ProtagonistA's fame , the name that always followed ProtagonistA around . I wanted to be the reason ProtagonistA went missing , the person to force ProtagonistA into the world . I needed to free ProtagonistA from this filthy planet , be the one to release ProtagonistA's soul to the millions scattered throughout the corners of the uncivilized , obscene Earth . I knew ProtagonistA could inspire the masses and provoke the future . < nl > I left ProtagonistA alone one night , let ProtagonistA sleep without the comfort of my warm carcass nestled just feet away . I had to , I needed to prepare . It was soon to be our time , the moment we 'd forever become names tied together in the media , in the voices of the people , in the pages of history and the world alike . I wanted to perfect where I 'd take ProtagonistA , where I 'd free ProtagonistA's soul into immortality . I needed it to be flawless enough to display ProtagonistA's art to the world . I prepped and painted , cleaned and set forth the tools to extract ProtagonistA ; my memory became blurred and uncertain as I toiled endlessly . It needed to be just as perfect as ProtagonistA . By the time I was content , my eyes had become bloody through lack of sleep , and the sun had long - since risen . < nl > ProtagonistA was not in ProtagonistA's room as my bare feet touched the familiar grass outside ProtagonistA's window . I pulled open the unlocked back door , silently dragging my heels across the hardwood floor I 'd felt so many times before . I 'd once danced in that very spot , my feet softly tapping the ground not inches from where ProtagonistA slept ; I could hear ProtagonistA's breathing in perfect synchronization as I spun . Now ProtagonistA's bed was empty , the window above it shattered and shimmering atop ProtagonistA's sheets . ProtagonistA's bureau lay sideways , its contents spilled out on the floor . I picked up the ruby shirt ProtagonistA wore to bed almost every night and held it to my face , the familiar scent of ProtagonistA's perfume washing over me . I continued through ProtagonistA's house . < nl > ProtagonistA valued ProtagonistA's cleanliness , as did I. I 'd watch as ProtagonistA spent hours , sometimes entire days , washing and organizing each and every inch of ProtagonistA's home , always to perfection . Now it was a mess , a chaotic wreck of turmoil and struggle . ProtagonistA 'd never done this to me before , never forced me to see ProtagonistA in such a shape of sheer humanity . ProtagonistA's walls , once rife with the beauty and life ProtagonistA painted , now lay bare , the art scattered and broken upon the floor . I clenched my teeth as I righted them , muscles tensing as I tried to hang them back in their correct places , but they were simply not the same . ProtagonistA had let someone else touch them ; they had lost their perfection . I allowed them fall back to the floor as I continued up ProtagonistA's stairs . < nl > The creme carpet outside ProtagonistA's studio door was stained a ruby red , still moist under the weight of my bare feet . I could hear ProtagonistA breathing heavily behind it , ProtagonistA's gasps raspy and strained as if under a tremendous weight . I wrapped my hand around the doorknob , twisting the cold brass knob and silently pushing it open . I had to blink as I peered in , the vulgarity ProtagonistA exposed me to almost unbearable . The room was in disarray : paintings torn apart , brushes scattered across the floor , shelves toppled over sideways . The worlds ProtagonistA 'd created for just the two of us , the universes that were supposed to inspire the future , were now stained , covered in blood and paint and split by knife . The hope ProtagonistA 'd given the planet lay destroyed in the middle of the room by ProtagonistA's broken body . ProtagonistA could n't even save ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistA glanced up at me , ProtagonistA's eyes studying me with a faint hint of recognition and dread , ProtagonistA's mouth gagged and broken . I could hear ProtagonistA's whimper softly , just as ProtagonistA occasionally did in ProtagonistA's sleep as I stood watch . Spilled paints surrounded ProtagonistA and mixed into a single , grotesque shade -- red , blues , yellows , whites , and every other color ProtagonistA 'd previously had organized on the shelves beside the door .   I stared at ProtagonistA for a moment , waiting for an apology as my eyes searched for the perfection and hope I 'd seen for so long . ProtagonistA had been flawless , the only thing that could save the world from the pornographic , filthy wreck it had become . Now , as ProtagonistA lay on the ground , ProtagonistA's eyes screaming for * my * help , all I could see was failure and dependence . A mirrored figure shifted in the far corner of the room , its back to me . I glanced up at it and slowly shook my head . ProtagonistA was no more perfect than the rest . < nl > I turned around and quietly shut the door , then began back down the path I 'd become so familiar traveling . < nl > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ < nl > * * ALTERNATE ENDINGS : * * < nl > Violent , exciting one : [ here](http://www.reddit.com / r / WritingPrompts / comments/2jws0e / wpserial_killer_has_been_monitoring_his_next / clg1ghi ) < nl >  Less ambiguous  ending : [ here.](http://www.reddit.com / r / WritingPrompts / comments/2jws0e / wpserial_killer_has_been_monitoring_his_next / clfxmdp ) < nl > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ < nl > ^If ^you ^enjoy ^my ^writing ^style , ^feel ^free ^to ^check ^out ^some ^of ^my ^other ^short ^stories [ ^in ^my ^new ^subreddit](http://www.reddit.com / r / ChokingVictimWrites/ ) ^or [ ^on ^my ^website!](http://wordsontheinternet.org/ ) < eos > 
< sos > I 've seen a lot of tens . It 's scary , really , how quickly people can go from six or even five to ten . Other people do n't realize how much danger surrounds them every day . It takes so little ... < nl > No , the tens are n't the ones that stay with you . Not for long , anyway . No , ProtagonistA was something else entirely . < nl > A zero . < nl > ProtagonistA was the first zero I ever saw , and the only one until I watched my children be born . They eventually grew into little ones and twos , of course , but for a short , wonderful time , they were tiny , giggling bundles of zero . But I 'm getting ahead of myself . < nl > * ProtagonistA * was the first . ProtagonistA I was drawn to ProtagonistA from the moment I saw ProtagonistA , dangling ProtagonistA's legs from a swing on the playground . How old could we have been ? 12 ? 13 , maybe . I was n't really sure what the numbers meant then , but the lowest I 'd ever seen was a one , so I knew ProtagonistA was something special . I stared at ProtagonistA from across the playground and ProtagonistA smiled at me , ProtagonistA's entire face beaming zero . I 'm telling you ... they say Helen of Troy had a face that launched a thousand ships . Well , ProtagonistA could make them come back home . If there ever was a face that could end wars , it was ProtagonistA . < nl > We were friends at first . I was terrified of ruining it by saying too much , but the words I wanted to say ran laps through my head every time I saw ProtagonistA . Then , on a hot summer night that was made for drunken mistakes , I said them anyway . And guess what ? ProtagonistA felt the same way . < nl > When I think about my kids , I do n't want them to be rich . I do n't want them to be famous . I just want them to feel what I felt back there on that summer night , because I know that if they find someone to share that moment with , they 'll be happy for the rest of their lives . < nl > Where was I ? Oh , yeah . After that night , me and ProtagonistA were one . We went through the rest of high school . College . We got married and got nice jobs . Bought a house . Got kids . Everything was perfect ... for a while . < nl > Something was going on with ProtagonistA . I first noticed it one Saturday morning when ProtagonistA was doing the laundry . ProtagonistA 'd been doing long hours at work all week and was n't feeling very well , so I offered to do the laundry . ProtagonistA looked up at me then and smiled faintly , but something was off . Instead of the clear , bright zero I was so used to seeing , ProtagonistA was flashing a faint one . The next moment , ProtagonistA was back to zero . I was stunned at first , but managed to convince myself it was nothing . ProtagonistA 'd had a tough week , that was all . < nl > The next time , we were having dinner with the kids . ProtagonistA was n't behaving like ProtagonistA's usual self , and ProtagonistA gave off a dull , weak three , like ProtagonistA was trying desperately to calm down . When I asked ProtagonistA if something was wrong , ProtagonistA mumbled something about an asshole at work . I wanted to dig deeper , but I had to take care of the kids . I asked ProtagonistA again later , but ProtagonistA clammed up completely . Everything about it was so unlike ProtagonistA . < nl > I racked my brain for weeks trying to find out what was wrong . Was it something I 'd done ? Was ProtagonistA about to get fired ? And the unthinkable : was ProtagonistA sick ? But why would n't ProtagonistA tell me ? I thought we had no secrets . I 'd always told ProtagonistA everything ! Well ... apart from the numbers . ProtagonistA 'd think I was mad . < nl > Then , one day , I found out the truth . < nl > It was early Friday morning . ProtagonistA never came home Thursday night . I was in bed , staring at the ceiling and running the same thoughts over and over through my mind . Imagining the worst . Was I going to get a call from the police ? The hospital ? I considered calling them to see if ProtagonistA was there . < nl > I heard a car pull up at our driveway . I did n't have to look ; it was ProtagonistA . I listened to ProtagonistA opening the door . Taking off ProtagonistA's shoes , walking up the stairs - was something off about ProtagonistA's steps ? - putting ProtagonistA's hand on the door handle . In the dead silence , I heard ProtagonistA take a deep breath on the other side . The door clicked and swung open , and there ProtagonistA was . < nl > ProtagonistA 'd been crying . ProtagonistA wore ProtagonistA's work clothes , but they were a bit ruffled and wrinkly . ProtagonistA looked at me with an expression I 'd never seen ProtagonistA wear before . Fresh tears rolled down ProtagonistA's cheeks . ProtagonistA drew another breath , short and shallow , and ProtagonistA's lips slowly parted . < nl >  We need to talk .  < nl > ProtagonistA's voice sounded muffled in my ears , like it was coming from far away . From someone else . ProtagonistA remained in the doorway , not saying a word . I did n't either . I just looked at ProtagonistA . * Sarah * . There ProtagonistA was , standing in our bedroom on the second floor of our house . In the rooms across the hall , our children were sleeping . < nl > I watched ProtagonistA standing there , and ProtagonistA looked back at me , ProtagonistA's face screaming a hot , burning ten . < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA's eyes widened in a mixture of shock and amusement , ' Sorry , can you repeat that ? ' < nl > ProtagonistB , did n't seem in the least bit fazed . ProtagonistB looked up from ProtagonistB's food and stared directly at ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB's dark eyes devoid of humour , and repeated . ' It 's odd . ' < nl > ProtagonistA sucked ProtagonistA's teeth slightly annoyed at having to clarify ProtagonistA . ' Not that bit , ' ProtagonistA explained through gritted teeth , ' the bit before . ' < nl > ProtagonistB , looked up again , then ProtagonistB's face broke into a smile as ProtagonistB understood . ProtagonistA felt a tinge of lust as ProtagonistB's dark curls bounced around ProtagonistB's face when ProtagonistB began to laugh girlishly . ' Sorry , yes of course . ' ProtagonistB's lips seemed pinker than usual . ' ProtagonistB think ProtagonistB would rather just stay in with ProtagonistC than go on a date . It 's odd . ' ProtagonistB blushed , realising what ProtagonistB 'd said . ' Most dates ... ' ProtagonistB stammered , ' minus the ones with ProtagonistA , obviously . ' < nl > ProtagonistA could feel all the lust ProtagonistA felt for ProtagonistB fall away . They 'd only been on a few dates , but this was still a little hard to hear . ProtagonistA coughed uncomfortably , trying to find the words to carry on the conversation . ' Why odd ... ' ProtagonistA finally prompted . < nl > ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA thoughtfully . ' Well , ProtagonistB guess , really , it 's odd that ProtagonistB just want to hang out with ProtagonistC all the time . But , as ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistB guess ProtagonistB's favourite thing to do is to sit on ProtagonistB's couch , watch a movie , eat some pizza and drink a beer or two ... ' ProtagonistB stopped ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA knew the words ProtagonistB wanted to add ; ' with Damien ' . < nl > ProtagonistA nodded slowly , now slightly bemused at the conversation . ' Do ProtagonistB not think that , considering everything ProtagonistB 've just said , ProtagonistB might consider ProtagonistC as more than just a platonic male flatmate ? ' < nl > ProtagonistB stared back at ProtagonistA blankly . ProtagonistA could almost hear ProtagonistB's brain working , the neurons madly firing trying to comprehend what ProtagonistA was insinuating . ProtagonistA sat up straight in ProtagonistA's chair , composing ProtagonistA , highly aware that ProtagonistA was essentially about to ' cockblock ' ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA spoke slightly slowly , trying to make sure ProtagonistB was keeping up . ' Bearing in mind ProtagonistB are sat on a date , with let 's face it ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistB 're talking about ProtagonistC , ProtagonistA have a slight suspicion ProtagonistB might in fact be in love with ProtagonistC ? ' < nl > Up until this point ProtagonistA 'd assumed ProtagonistB was just hiding ProtagonistB's feelings , but now , as ProtagonistA watched it dawn on ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA realised ProtagonistB 'd just been oblivious to the whole thing . ProtagonistB's mouth fell open , somewhat comically , and ProtagonistB stared off into the distance , ProtagonistB's eyes wide . ProtagonistA could n't help but laugh . ProtagonistB immediately came back into the room , and ProtagonistB's face flushed red in embarrassment . < nl > ' ProtagonistB 'd ... ProtagonistB just ... ' ProtagonistB stuttered , ProtagonistB face bright pink . ' ProtagonistB guess ProtagonistB should have realised . ProtagonistB think it just crept up on ProtagonistB . ' < nl > ProtagonistA nodded in a compassionate sort of way . The damage was done , the date was over . ProtagonistA sighed wistfully and took up ProtagonistA's fork to continue eating , ' at least the food 's good ' ProtagonistA thought apathetically . < nl > ' Everything ok here ? ' Both ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB's 's heads shot up in shock to look at ProtagonistD . ProtagonistA smiled and nodded . < nl > ' ProtagonistB 'm in love with ProtagonistA . ' ProtagonistB blurted out , a look of surprised horror on ProtagonistB's face . < nl > ProtagonistD raised ProtagonistD's eyebrows in a comical look of shock which quickly gave way to an odd sympathetic and yet encouraging smile . Awkwardly ProtagonistD gently patted ProtagonistB's arm and said ' good for ProtagonistB . ' ProtagonistD then walked away leaving ProtagonistB to process the information and ProtagonistA to eat . < nl > After some time , in fact just as ProtagonistA finished ProtagonistA's food and put down ProtagonistA's fork , ProtagonistB seemed to wake up from ProtagonistB's thoughts and stood up out of ProtagonistB's chair . < nl > ' ProtagonistB ... ProtagonistB should tell ProtagonistC . ' ProtagonistA nodded , now only half listening as ProtagonistA started to survey the dessert menu . ' ProtagonistC deserves to know . ' ProtagonistA nodded again , not looking up from the menu until ProtagonistA became aware of the silence than had fallen between them . When ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB was sat back down and staring at ProtagonistA sympathetically . ProtagonistA felt a jolt of irritation , and ProtagonistA put ProtagonistA's menu down to stare a little harshly back at ProtagonistB . ' I must be the worst date ProtagonistB 've ever had . ProtagonistB 'm so sorry . ' < nl > ProtagonistA could hear the emotion in ProtagonistB's voice , ProtagonistA sighed irritably but ProtagonistA's expression softened slightly . ' Do I like ProtagonistB ? Yes . Did I think we may have a future ? Maybe . Do I want to be in love with someone who 's in love with someone else entirely ? No way . It would n't have been very good if I 'd gone on to fall in love with ProtagonistB and then ProtagonistB 'd realised , would it ? I 'd rather hear it now than when we were just about to board a plane to a new home . Or on our wedding day . Or at the birth of our first child ... ' ProtagonistB raised ProtagonistB's eyebrow . ' Ok , too far , but ProtagonistB catch my drift . I 'd much rather get it all out in the open , and just let ProtagonistB run off into the sunset with ProtagonistC now , rather than be ' that guy ' who gets in the way and ends up cast as the jerk despite the fact I 'm actually just the guy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time on a date with ProtagonistE despite the fact , from what ProtagonistB 've told me , ProtagonistE spends pretty much every waking second of every day either with ProtagonistC or , at the very least , thinking about ProtagonistC ... ' ProtagonistA took a deep breath , it was a sore subject , this was n't the first time ProtagonistA 'd had to point out to a date that things were n't exactly ' on track ' towards a healthy emotional entanglement . ProtagonistB continued to stare at ProtagonistA blankly . ProtagonistA rolled ProtagonistA's eyes . ' So no , it 's not the worst date ProtagonistA 've ever been on . ' < nl > ProtagonistB looked a little relieved , and nodded . < nl > They sat awkwardly for a moment before ProtagonistA pointed towards the door and said the most whimsical thing ProtagonistA could think ' go to ProtagonistC ... ' ProtagonistB mumbled something about paying half of the bill , put some crumpled notes on the table beside ProtagonistB's half eaten meal , and left . < nl > ProtagonistA rolled ProtagonistA's eyes , and picked up the menu once more . Just as ProtagonistA 'd decided ProtagonistA would stick to coffee , ProtagonistA heard a gentle , lady - like cough . ProtagonistA put down ProtagonistA's menu to see ProtagonistB sat opposite ProtagonistA . Like ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB's eyes were dark , but these had a sultriness to them that replaced ProtagonistB's innocent , almost girlish , look . < nl > ' ProtagonistB 'm sorry , but ProtagonistB could n't help overhearing ... ' < nl > ProtagonistA gestured that ProtagonistA did n't mind . ' Are ProtagonistB here alone ? ' < nl > ' ProtagonistB was n't , but ProtagonistB am now . ' ProtagonistB smiled again , this time a little mischievously . ' ProtagonistC had an unhealthy fixation with ProtagonistF that ProtagonistB felt ProtagonistC should explore before we pursued anything . ' < nl > ProtagonistA laughed knowingly . ' So ProtagonistC 's gone to find ProtagonistF to confess ProtagonistC's love ? ' < nl > ProtagonistB laughed again , ' ProtagonistC ... and no , ProtagonistB think ProtagonistC 's gone to be alone and process ProtagonistC's newly realised sexuality . ' < nl > ProtagonistB smiled broadly and extended a slender hand . ' ProtagonistB 'm Olivia Johnson . ProtagonistB 'm not in love with any of ProtagonistB's friends , have no irregular feelings towards ProtagonistB's dad and have no exes in the closet other than ProtagonistG . ProtagonistB am emotionally available and find ProtagonistA , upon first impressions , incredibly attractive . ' < nl > ProtagonistA obligingly took ProtagonistB's hand and gave it a firm shake . ' ProtagonistA 'm Bobby Holden . ProtagonistA have no sexual urges for men , ProtagonistH was a perfectly lovely human but ProtagonistA do n't want ProtagonistA's girlfriend to be anything like ProtagonistH and ProtagonistA would , one day , like a wife and a couple of kids to keep ProtagonistA out of trouble . ProtagonistA am emotionally available and ProtagonistA find ProtagonistB very attractive indeed . ' < nl > They sat staring lustfully at each other , until they noticed ProtagonistD stood between them . ProtagonistD looked from one to the other and ProtagonistD blurted out , ' You 're both completely insane . ' < eos > 
< sos > The people burst through the gates of the mansion . < nl > The guards tried to stop them , but they had been armed with electric guitars , a shockingly effective crowd control weapon , but ProtagonistA had taken out their generators . A single riff had been enough . < nl > The guards stood helpless as the people marched in to the mansion with beautiful roses and well kept grass while out there they suffered under ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had barely needed to do anything in this city . The embers of the anger were already there , all ProtagonistA had to do was fan them < nl > The people marching to a beat . < nl > It was the familiar THUMP THUMP CLAP . THUMP THUMP CLAP that everyone knew . Individually they would stand no chance against ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a powerful musician to have controlled the entire city . But there were hundreds here . Even a simple beat like this , made by relatively unskilled users could pack quite the punch . < nl > As if in response , the mansion began to shake , reverberating with the power of the beat of hundreds . They began to sing the song of the prophets Queen . The musicians , when they had first risen after music became powerful , had tried to wipe out all instruction and memory of music to prevent the common people from learning music and challenging their master . But some tunes do not fade . And while instruments could be taken away , hands and tongues could not . < nl > In response to the music the house literally began to rock back and forth . It would soon crumble . Perhaps ProtagonistA had overestimated ProtagonistA , if ProtagonistA could not withstand such a plain assault , it was a wonder ProtagonistA came into control at all . < nl > A single chord reverberated throughout the mansion . The mass stopped as if struck , their beat broken , their voices cut off in shock . And then another chord was hit , and another , and as ProtagonistA watched , ProtagonistA came out on the balcony with a portable battery and a guitar and began to play . < nl > The people swayed , entranced . ProtagonistA dared not use any physical magic on ProtagonistA's own property and people , and so ProtagonistA influenced their minds . ProtagonistA , hidden within the crowd , felt only an intense rage . Rock musicians were the worst . They were merely an imitation of the true art form , the true expression of emotion . Passion , rage , regret it was all there in metal . To deliberately dampen these powers ... it was sick . < nl > Well , ProtagonistA knew it would come down to this . < nl > ProtagonistA took out the guitar ProtagonistA had hidden on ProtagonistA's back with a coat . It too had a portable source of power . ProtagonistA struck a chord and the air hummed with power . < nl > ProtagonistA took in the vibrations , felt the familiar feeling vibrate in ProtagonistA's chest . This . This was power .   The spell ProtagonistA had lain shattered like glass . ProtagonistA let out a scream of passion and power and began to literally rise above the crowd , ProtagonistA's guitar in hand . < nl > As ProtagonistA rose ProtagonistA could make out ProtagonistA better . ProtagonistA wore jeans and denim jacket over a black shirt . ProtagonistA's red hair stood on its end , as if a halo , no doubt responding to ProtagonistA's power . ProtagonistA's mouth was curved into a sneer , and ProtagonistA's emerald eyes flashed dangerously . < nl > We stood , facing eye to eye , and the crowd below us fell silent , in respect and awe . They were about to witness a duel . These were things of legend , of the past when musicians fought for control over areas . These were stable times , musicians dared not fight each other . They had learned that lesson in the First Wars when we had almost wiped each other out . < nl >  You fool ! What are ProtagonistA doing ! ProtagonistA dare intrude on * ProtagonistA's * domain ?  ProtagonistA struck a note that vibrated , and ProtagonistA literally felt ProtagonistA's anger wash over ProtagonistA . < nl > Weakling . ProtagonistA roared and responded with ProtagonistA's own weapon . And a pillar of white hot flame rushed towards ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistA's eyes widened , but ProtagonistA dissipated the fire with another note . So not completely incompetent . < nl >  You wiped out our people ! You mainstream musicians , you pretend to rule over these ... *commoners * ,  ProtagonistA spat out the word ,  but you play what they want to listen , you are subject to their whims , their tastes . ProtagonistA's people were wiped out , because we played music that was good , not what people perceived as good !  < nl > ProtagonistA's eyes widened in recognition .  No ... there are no metal artists left . They were all killed !  < nl > ProtagonistA let forth a fork of lightning in response and laughed .  ProtagonistA did not realize yet ? ! ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA's magic was ProtagonistA's puny * rock * ? No . This far greater . Pure energy .  < nl > ProtagonistA reflected the lightning away , and fired ProtagonistA's own spell , this time with ProtagonistA's own music and voice combined . Looks like play time was over . < nl > Still floating ProtagonistA launched into a song . Each note firing a wealth of both physical and mental assaults with it , but ProtagonistA responded in kind with ProtagonistA's own song . This was a duel . Before we had simply been trading blows , shit talking so to say . This was true battle . We both knew the idea of our song , what it was supposed to be like , but we had to adapt . Most of our magic collided in the center in sparks or steam , but some got through to both of us . When you see a gout of flame come at you , you change pitch , alter your chord slightly . You sense a weakness in the other 's resonance so you capitalize with a hammer - on . You improvise when needed . As death came within inches of ProtagonistA ProtagonistA reveled it , and with a shock , ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistA did too . The anger was gone from ProtagonistA's eyes now , just pure joy . This was what we did . < nl > The crowd stood , transfixed . With the wild energy lashing around they should have scrambled , ran away as far as possible . But with the spells of our voices intertwining they could not move . They did not * want * to move . They lay helpless , watching gods battle . < nl > ProtagonistA was almost sad when it was over . ProtagonistA was good , far greater than ProtagonistA had thought possible for a rock artist , but ProtagonistA was limited by ProtagonistA's genre . After what seemed like an eternity , ProtagonistA messed up ProtagonistA's chord , and ProtagonistA's voice faltered in shock . ProtagonistA capitalized . ProtagonistA fired shot after shot of powerful bursts . ProtagonistA's rhythm disrupted , ProtagonistA fell on the defense , try desperately to block ProtagonistA's relentless strikes . As ProtagonistA did ProtagonistA moved closer and closer to ProtagonistA , making the strikes come more rapidly . Now ProtagonistA began to tremble , ProtagonistA's face contorted in focus and exhaustion , it was inevitable that ProtagonistA mess up . < nl > * There ! * < nl > ProtagonistA missed an arc of green energy and it slammed into ProtagonistA , freeing the guitar from ProtagonistA's grasp , and it crashed with a final note , while ProtagonistA landed flat on the ground . < nl > ProtagonistA sat up as ProtagonistA approached , guitar still held loosely in ProtagonistA's hands . ProtagonistA's hair had settled down now , but was still disheveled . ProtagonistA looked ProtagonistA in the eyes , ProtagonistA's green eyes flashing with indigence and defiance . < nl > ProtagonistA held up ProtagonistA's chin , not looking away .  ProtagonistA have bested ProtagonistA . Finish it .  < nl > ProtagonistA played a single chord and flash of flame burst out , but ProtagonistA did n't flinch . ProtagonistA would do . < nl > The flame died an inch from ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistA in shock , ProtagonistA's mouth slightly open .  Kill ProtagonistA ? Do n't be ridiculous ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm not like ProtagonistA's ancestors , ProtagonistA do not waste musical talent . ProtagonistA offer ProtagonistA power , true music , music unlike ProtagonistA have ever wielded .  ProtagonistA held out ProtagonistA's hand .  The question is , will ProtagonistA accept ?  < nl >  And if ProtagonistA do n't ? ,  ProtagonistA asked , ProtagonistA's voice perfect , light but rich . < nl > ProtagonistA smiled savagely .  ProtagonistA want it . ProtagonistA could see it in ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA play music for its power , for its own sake , not for these ,  ProtagonistA gestured to the crowd under ProtagonistA which had finally begun to snap out of its daze ,  commoners . ProtagonistA understand the power ProtagonistA just saw from ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA want it . ProtagonistA's talent is wasted on rock .  < nl > ProtagonistA still looked intensely at ProtagonistA , but gave ProtagonistA the slightest nod . ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's hand . < nl > ( minor edits ) < nl > EDIT : Whoa ! I appreciate all the feedback and kind words , truly , they mean a lot . Also thank you specifically to ProtagonistA ! < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA , bless ProtagonistA's soul , was a great lady , but ProtagonistA was also a sucker for the con - men that sold stuff on the streets in New York City .   Every year ProtagonistB would take ProtagonistA there for ProtagonistA's  New York Minute  as ProtagonistA liked to call ProtagonistA little vacation .   We would stay somewhere in one of the boroughs for 2 or 3 days and go see the sights and take in a Broadway show or two .   Every year , no matter how much ProtagonistB tried to prevent it , ProtagonistA would come home with several  Rolex  watches and a bunch of other junk . < nl > The worst was back in 1997 , when ProtagonistA spent $ 100 on a small radio shack box with 2 leds on it .   ProtagonistC said that if the led was green , you would visit wherever you were again , however if it was red , that meant that you never again be at that location .   When opened the box up , all it contained was a circuit board covered in plastic ( to make it look mysterious and to cover up the 555 chip ProtagonistC most likely used ) , 2 leds , and a 9 volt battery .   ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistA's little box , and carried it wherever ProtagonistA went .   Most of the time the little green led was lit , but occasionally when we went out to Pennsylvania or upstate New York , the little red led would light .   Whenever that happened , ProtagonistA would play tourist . < nl > ProtagonistB gave up trying to tell ProtagonistA that the box was fake , and just replaced the 9 volt battery every few months so that  ProtagonistA's box  would stay lit .   As the years went by , ProtagonistB did n't really think much more about it , after all , if it made ProtagonistA happy , it made ProtagonistB happy .   We still went to New York City every year , and ProtagonistB still had to watch out for getting ripped off .   At least ProtagonistB prevented ProtagonistA from paying $ 2000 for a box that could contact the dead .   ProtagonistA wanted to talk to ProtagonistD , but ProtagonistB convinced ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA would be able to see or talk to ProtagonistD until the day that ProtagonistA went to join ProtagonistD .   ProtagonistB 'm still not sure how ProtagonistB actually talked ProtagonistA out of it - the only thing ProtagonistB can think of is that ProtagonistA is a devout Catholic and figured that using that box would be a sin . < nl > Things were fine until this year 's trip to New York City .   ProtagonistA wanted to see Cats , so ProtagonistB booked us a room at the Hilton down at the Trade Center for our annual  New York Minute .    Sunday was great , we went to the show , and even had a chance to get over to see Lady Liberty .   Monday was a disaster . < nl > When we got up in the morning , everything was fine until ProtagonistA noticed that ProtagonistA's little box was glowing red .   ProtagonistB had planned to take ProtagonistA up to the top of the tower to see the city , but ProtagonistA grew increasingly upset when the red led did n't go back to green . < nl >  ProtagonistA , how often do we come to the towers ?   Just because it is staying red does n't mean ProtagonistA 're gon na die !  < nl >  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA 'm 83 years old and could die at any time .   ProtagonistA 'm not ready to go yet !  < nl >  Look , let 's just go to the top , then ProtagonistB 'll take ProtagonistA to Windows over the World for lunch .   Put the box away , and have a good time .   After all , it was green when ProtagonistA were in the room this morning .  < nl >  Fine , but if ProtagonistA die , it 's ProtagonistB's fault !  < nl > We made it to the top of the tower , saw the sights , then went to lunch .   The little red light never wavered .   ProtagonistB tried taking ProtagonistA's shopping in the Trade Center Mall , but all ProtagonistA could do is stare at the red light .   ProtagonistB finally gave up and took ProtagonistA back to the room .   At least the stupid red led finally went off and the green was back on . < nl >  ProtagonistA want to go home !   ProtagonistA 'm not gon na die here in New York City !  < nl >  But , ProtagonistA , we are paid up through Wednesday , and ProtagonistB thought we could go see the Mets play !  < nl >  Forget the stupid Mets , ProtagonistA WANT TO GO HOME !  < nl >  Fine , ProtagonistA , we 'll leave tomorrow morning .  < nl >  Early ?  < nl >  Early .  < nl > Tuesday morning rolled around and we were up at 6 am .   As if things were n't bad enough , the stupid box was now red in the room .   ProtagonistA , freaked out , and ProtagonistB had to lead ProtagonistA down to the parking deck .   ProtagonistB was going to check out , but decided to forget it and just eat the extra day .   We finally left the Trade Center complex about 7 , and headed towards the Holland Tunnel , and home .   ProtagonistB kept talking to ProtagonistA about anything and everything to keep ProtagonistA's mind off of that stupid box . < nl >  The box is green .  < nl >  What box , ProtagonistA ?    We had been talking about Christmas presents when ProtagonistA said that . < nl >  ProtagonistA's box , of course !   What are ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ?  < nl > Sure enough the little green led is lit , and stayed lit as we entered the tunnel .   Thank God it stayed green , ProtagonistA was beginning to calm down and not look like ProtagonistA was gon na have a stroke any minute now . < nl >  Turn on ProtagonistE .  < nl >  What , ProtagonistA ?  < nl >  Turn on ProtagonistE !   ProtagonistA want to see what ProtagonistE is up to today .  < nl > Thankful ProtagonistA was acting somewhat normal , ProtagonistB turned on ProtagonistE .   ProtagonistB ca n't stand ProtagonistE's show , but ProtagonistA loves ProtagonistE .   As we put the City behind us for another year , ProtagonistB gleefully ignored ProtagonistE's babble until they mentioned something about a plane hitting one of the towers .   ProtagonistB's face went white as ProtagonistB realized what ProtagonistE was talking about - the place we had just left .   For once ProtagonistB agreed with ProtagonistE - how the hell could a plane hit the trade center tower on a lovely sunny day ? < nl >  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's box was a good buy !   We coulda been hit by an airplane !  < nl >  Yes , ProtagonistA .  < eos > 
< sos >  Okay , here we go ,  ProtagonistA said , spinning the wheels on ProtagonistA's mechanical glove , which sent ProtagonistA on a dizzying ride through space and time . < nl > ProtagonistA landed in a pub buzzing with activity , colorful bottles lined the wall behind the bar and yellow light radiated through heaps of stacked cups . Women in long dresses and updos danced to the live tunes of a jazz band , while the bartender idly polished the counter . < nl > ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way through the thick vapors of cigar smoke towards one of the quieter corners of the pub . ProtagonistB sat alone in a booth , swiveling cubes of ice in what undoubtedly was a glass of scotch . < nl >  Fashionable as ever ,  ProtagonistB noted , raising ProtagonistB's glass unenthusiastically at ProtagonistA . < nl >  Well , it 's not like ProtagonistA had time to change ,  ProtagonistA said , looking down at ProtagonistA's wrinkly renaissance dress . < nl >  Time , sure .  ProtagonistB pulled out a pack of cigarettes from ProtagonistB's chest pocket .  Want a smoke ?  < nl >  Come on , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  You know ProtagonistA do n't smoke , and besides , we 've got important things to do .  < nl >  Important , right .  ProtagonistB said , inhaling deeply .  Ah , that 's the stuff .  < nl >  Why do n't ProtagonistB start by giving ProtagonistA an update ?  < nl > ProtagonistB leaned back , regarding ProtagonistA with an amused look .  Why do n't ProtagonistA start by sitting down for a moment , ProtagonistA ?  < nl > ProtagonistA felt like kicking ProtagonistB . This was why ProtagonistA hated the fifties . ProtagonistB basically turned into a Philip Marlowe with an impossible reluctance to cooperate . < nl >  Fine ,  ProtagonistA said , with a resigned sigh .  Buy ProtagonistA a drink .  < nl >  Buy ProtagonistA's own drinks ,  ProtagonistB said , yawning . < nl >  You know , ProtagonistA like ProtagonistB way better in the seventies .  < nl >  It 's the hair , is n't it ?  ProtagonistB said , winking . < nl >  Tell ProtagonistA one thing , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said , snatching away the cigarette ProtagonistB was just about to light .  If ProtagonistA were one of those dainty women over there - one of those swooning helpless things , without a hint of independence - would ProtagonistB help ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA came running to ProtagonistB ?  < nl >  Swooning , huh ?  ProtagonistB emptied ProtagonistB's scotch .  If ProtagonistB remember correctly , back in the 16th century-  < nl >  Yeah , yeah , ProtagonistA could n't handle the corsets , whatever ,  ProtagonistA said , rolling ProtagonistA's eyes .  What would it take for ProtagonistB to give ProtagonistA the damn update ?  < nl >  How about ProtagonistA get out of that moldy old dress and get the next round ?  ProtagonistB said , nodding at ProtagonistB's empty glass .  ProtagonistB have n't seen those lovely butt cheeks since Leonardo painted Mona .  < nl >  Why did ProtagonistA marry ProtagonistB back in the Antiques , ProtagonistA simply do n't see it ,  ProtagonistA said . < nl >  ProtagonistB think it was the hair .  < nl >  You know , ProtagonistA was going to give ProtagonistB the night of ProtagonistB's life , but ProtagonistA guess ProtagonistB 'll have to wait until Zeppelin releases their first album , ProtagonistA mean , it 's only another twenty years .  < nl >  ProtagonistB 'm sure it 'll be worth the wait ,  ProtagonistB said and got up .  Until then there are some swooning ladies by the bar , who appear to be in need of ProtagonistB's immediate help .  < nl > ProtagonistA cursed through ProtagonistA's teeth and watched ProtagonistB strut over to the dance floor . Be that way , ProtagonistA thought and spun the wheel on ProtagonistA's glove again . < eos > 
< sos >  Do you remember when we first met ?  ProtagonistA asked , pouring the last of the last bottle . < nl > I smiled .    I was eighteen .   Physics class on the Ohio State campus .  < nl >  Yes ?   Tell ProtagonistA what you first thought .    ProtagonistA's dark eyes seemed to swallow all of my peripheral vision like an entire night full of stars on the Mediterranean , centuries before I was born . < nl >  I was stunned .   ProtagonistA were so beautiful and so smart .   ProtagonistA seemed to know ProtagonistA's way about the world in every way .   How nature worked .   How people worked .   Like ProtagonistA were ageless .  < nl >  You guessed ProtagonistA from the start !    ProtagonistA laughed . < nl > We had fallen in love and learned about each other .   Loving an immortal turned out to have some complications .   For ProtagonistA , how to keep it fresh ?   ProtagonistA had been alive for more than two millenia and seen it all .   For me , how to not die ?   Turns out a time machine does not make a mortal live any longer . < nl > ProtagonistA had a plan .   A plan given to ProtagonistA by a strange augurer way in ProtagonistA's past .   We had no idea of the origin of this plan , but we knew it would work . < nl > After a pause , ProtagonistA asked ,  Tell ProtagonistA where is this Ohio State .  < nl > I described to ProtagonistA a country that would be discovered a thousand years in ProtagonistA's future and a culture that could not possibly make sense in any context of this age .   How we studied in the library together and forged this strange bond while working on temporal research .   A young physics prodigy and an immortal of ageless wisdom . < nl >  So ,  I asked ProtagonistA ,  do ProtagonistA remember when we first met ?  < nl >  Of course !  ProtagonistA replied , a great mischief in ProtagonistA's eyes .    The great steps of the city of Parsa !  < nl > ProtagonistA's eyes grew distant .    ProtagonistA was eighteen .   A thousand years ago , ProtagonistA had no idea ProtagonistA would live so long .   It is still so fresh in ProtagonistA's mind .  < nl >  ProtagonistA guess ProtagonistA was persuasive .   Or will be !  < nl >  Oh , ProtagonistA was so rebellious !   To be seduced by a strange foreign man !  < nl > ProtagonistA told me of ProtagonistA's unbridled passions , ProtagonistA's indignant family and flights in the darkness .   Strange stories of living for ever and taming time as a ship tames the waves . < nl > We had been living here in Cyprus for a year .   We dated each other one year at a stretch , together in the most interesting places on earth , at our whim .   Our year here had drawn to a close and it was time to move on .   There was no packing to be done .   The time machine would move only itself and my naked body . < nl >  Where will I find ProtagonistA ?  I asked ProtagonistA .   This always filled me with dread , but of course ProtagonistA was certain ProtagonistA would find me . < nl >  Alexandria .   At the library .    That mischievous grin .   ProtagonistA and libraries .    Take one month to get there , and then go back exactly 100 years .   Meet ProtagonistA on the day of Mercuralia .  < nl > I just drank in ProtagonistA's beauty for a moment .   It would be hard to be away from ProtagonistA for more than a month .   I hoped that ProtagonistA would remember me after a hundred years .   But of course I already knew ProtagonistA would- for me , that year - long date was last year .   And in due course ProtagonistA asked ,  Where shall ProtagonistA find you ?  < nl >  Constantinople .   One hundred years from now .  < nl > ProtagonistA's eyes fell .   It was hard for ProtagonistA .   It broke my heart but part of me was reassured that ProtagonistA's love endured .   I sometimes wondered if ProtagonistA took lovers in the long intervals , but I really did not care as long as we came back to each other . < nl > We kissed passionately one final time on this island .   But before we parted , ProtagonistA stopped me . < nl >  When you go back to Alexandria .   When you arrive in the past .   Find a sword , first thing .   Even before you find clothes .  < nl > ProtagonistA looked worried .   I must have looked bewildered . < nl >  When we met-- when we meet ...   in the library , ProtagonistA told me to remind ProtagonistA .  < nl > ProtagonistA held me a moment longer . < nl >  It will be alright ,  ProtagonistA added .    Whatever it was , you were unharmed .   But you wanted ProtagonistA to tell you , you will need that sword .  < nl > We parted .   ProtagonistA would live out the next hundred years to meet a slightly younger me in Constantinople .   And I would travel to Alexandria , then hop backwards in time to meet ProtagonistA . < eos > 
< sos >  The government must fall !  ProtagonistA shouted , loud and clear . Of course , nobody was listening , but still , ProtagonistA shouted . < nl > Ever since ProtagonistA turned 15 , around four years ago , ProtagonistA developed a hatred for the  corrupt  government . The way they build soldiers for a war , and take money from poor people . The way they force having green energy , though it reduces jobs for the people . The way they make you pay an extra 8 % for everything , just because they * have to * use our money .  Ugh , ca n't they just use the rich people 's money ?  ProtagonistA 'd say . < nl > But , I digress . Armed with nothing but ProtagonistA's lucky bow and a single arrow ( seriously , a single arrow ) , ProtagonistA plans to overthrow the government and eventually turn the nation into a communist republic . I do n't even know why ProtagonistA has a bow . It 's not like it 'll do anything significant , other than give someone a small wound . ProtagonistA does n't even have bow training ! And really , could ProtagonistA not build arrows out of a stick , pidgeon feather , sharp pebble , and some duct tape ? I mean , that 's the simplest thing to build . It 's not like ProtagonistA has to smith a sword from scratch , which , even though ProtagonistA ca n't smith to save ProtagonistA's life , would still be more effective than a bow and arrow . < nl > Sorry , I go on tangents sometimes . It 's just hard being ProtagonistA * only * friend , and having to help ProtagonistA overthrow the ( perfectly good ) government is annoying . I go to college from Monday thru Friday , and I have a shit - load of homework over the weekend . I do n't have the time to help ProtagonistA  ooh overthrow the government ooh  . The only thing I * can * provide is smithing services , and ProtagonistA already broke the two steel swords I supplied ProtagonistA with . Not only did they take weeks to smith , ProtagonistA said they  just fell apart  . Baloney ! Those swords were my finest work ! ProtagonistB said I had the finest blades ProtagonistB 'd ever seen ! < nl > Also , the reason ProtagonistA does n't use a gun , which are legal to carry openly , provided you have a permit , is because they 're  not intimidating enough , duh !  Really ? Not as intimidating as a bow and * single arrow * ? Ooh , I 'm trembling in my tiny sneakers , ProtagonistA . < nl > Anyways , here 's the  valiant tale of our brave hero  ProtagonistA 's forcing me to write . Just know that I 'm exaggarating every detail , okay ? Now , then : < nl > * Our tale begins with ProtagonistA . As a teenager , ProtagonistA had grown to despise the awful , corrupt system . The slimy presidents with their filthy lies , and the treasury that just takes money from innocent people ! They go to war with other nations , build armies to fight , and then ... they try to make peace , as if it never happened . * < nl > * Fed up with this system , ProtagonistA took action . ProtagonistA armed ProtagonistA with ProtagonistA's lucky bow and arrow , smithed by ProtagonistA's closest friend , and left ProtagonistA's home to start the revolution . You see , ProtagonistA loved the martial charm of ancient weapons . A gun would simply not suit ProtagonistA , no matter how powerful . And , ProtagonistA only took one arrow , a symbol of ProtagonistA ... uh ... * < nl > * ProtagonistA took to the streets , gaining loyal followers to ProtagonistA's cause . Everyone resented the corrupt system with which they had to deal . ProtagonistA captured their hearts , and their minds , building a small army . * < nl > * At dawn of an unknown day , they struck the White House . The battle between the people , and the system , lasted six days and six nights . But , just before midnight , ProtagonistA pulled a trick - shot with ProtagonistA's single arrow , hitting the president in the heart . A perfect shot from ProtagonistA . * < nl > * ProtagonistA took the nation by storm , quickly making ProtagonistA the most loved president in history . ProtagonistA , we salute ProtagonistA . * < nl > Of course , ProtagonistA 's actually going to become a shit leader who just spends all day bragging about how good ProtagonistA is , but that 's between you and I. < nl > * * * * * < nl > * Creative criticism appreciated .

< sos > They came for ProtagonistA at dawn , screaming across the dusty plain , throwing up a choking cloud in their wake which turned the sun red . ProtagonistA knew this was an entirely dramatic decision , since ProtagonistB 'd set up camp sometime the afternoon before . Within sight of the city 's towers . < nl > The gates and walls of Newhaven were more than strong enough to keep them out , but that was n't what ProtagonistA wanted . ProtagonistA's men had their orders , all civilians had been evacuated to the bunkers . They were ready . ProtagonistA was ready for ProtagonistA's audience . < nl > They burst through the gate , apparently not even registering how easy it all was . Either they were too used to attacking the smaller settlements and steads around Newhaven , or this was their first raid . Either way , it was going to be their last . It was n't every day the bandits actually presented themselves to you , after all . < nl > ProtagonistB took an astonishly long time to reach ProtagonistA , though ProtagonistA deliberately stayed in ProtagonistA's office . ProtagonistB must have stopped for a rousing speech or two along the way . ProtagonistA stood wearily as ProtagonistB burst through the door , bow at the ready , dark hair flying dramatically . Only ProtagonistB's closest lieutenants were with ProtagonistB , each similarly armed with longbows , crossbows and swords . < nl >  Hello , * ProtagonistA * !  ProtagonistB spat , tossing ProtagonistB's head . < nl >  ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA said , sighing inwardly .  Glad ProtagonistB 're home safe .  < nl >  ProtagonistB 've returned !  ProtagonistB said , in what ProtagonistB obviously believed was a fierce , rabble - rousing voice . In reality , ProtagonistB just sounded like a sixteen - year - old girl having a temper tantrum . < nl >  ProtagonistA see that .  < nl >  ProtagonistB 've returned ,  ProtagonistB repeated , ProtagonistB's eyes flashing ,  to free the people from the yoke of their cruel tyrant ! ProtagonistB 've returned , ProtagonistA , so that we can rebuild society as something good for all , so that ProtagonistB's child will never know a world of oppression , indecency , and indignity !  < nl > At that ProtagonistB threw a look at Jaime , Tom Brandon 's eldest boy , who was stood right behind ProtagonistB . It was obviously meant to be a meaningful glance , or maybe a longing one . Instead they both just looked a bit constipated . The pause gave ProtagonistA a chance to process what ProtagonistB 'd said , however . ProtagonistA slapped a hand over ProtagonistA's face , groaning . < nl >  Fuck 's sake , ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB 're pregnant too ?  < nl >  This is n't about who ProtagonistB choose to love !  ProtagonistB cried dramatically , ProtagonistB's face turning red as a bead of sweat began to trickle from ProtagonistB's hairline .  This is about ...  < nl >  It 's about ProtagonistA grounding ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said sharply , dropping ProtagonistA's hand . ProtagonistA gestured , and ProtagonistA's men came forward , rifles at the ready . ProtagonistB's followers looked uncertain now .  It 's about ProtagonistB thinking we love Hannah more . What this is about , ProtagonistB , is ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC 's what this is about .  < nl >  ProtagonistB did n't join the bandits !  ProtagonistB yelled . That attempt at a revolutionary tone had vanished now . ProtagonistB stamped ProtagonistB's foot .  They 're temporary * allies * . ProtagonistA 'll reward them when ProtagonistA take over , so ...  < nl >  They came with ProtagonistB because they thought they 'd get to pillage the city while ProtagonistB were up here .  ProtagonistA said , deliberately staying calm .  Do n't worry , ProtagonistA 'll deal with them . Kids , you hand your weapons over to ProtagonistA's men now . Your parents have been worried sick about you all .  < nl > The other kids , staring down the barrels of actual guns with the crackle of gunfire outside , handed over their gear willingly . One , a girl who could n't have been older than twelve , started to cry . ProtagonistB stamped ProtagonistB's foot again and shrieked wordlessly . < nl >  You always have to ruin * everything * !  ProtagonistB screamed ,  ProtagonistB 'm going to take over the city and free everyone from slavery , and * you ca n't stop ProtagonistB * !  < nl >  ProtagonistB , no one here 's a slave . This is the only truly safe place for half a continent . People are happy to be here . ProtagonistB 've been out there now , ProtagonistB 've see . That , have n't ProtagonistB ? Anyway , ProtagonistB 'll get ProtagonistB's chance to lead when ProtagonistA retire ...  < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm not waiting until then ! ProtagonistA 're a monster !  < nl > ProtagonistB loosed the arrow - the look on ProtagonistB's face suggested ProtagonistB had n't meant to do it , or maybe that ProtagonistB was surprised ProtagonistB had dared too . The arrow flew surprisingly true ( ProtagonistB must have been practicing ) and lodged in ProtagonistA's vest . ProtagonistA took half a step back , bumping into the desk , and let out an irritated grunt . Before ProtagonistA could do anything else there was a deafening report , followed by a heavy thud . < nl > ProtagonistA looked down at ProtagonistB , horrified . Then ProtagonistB rolled over , pressed a hand to the exit wound just above ProtagonistB's hip ( which was , thankfully , oozing rather than gushing ) and began to weep hysterically . < nl >  ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistA shot ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA let ProtagonistA shoot ProtagonistB !  < nl > ProtagonistA sighed heavily .  Dave , take the others to the station , contact their parents . Henry , ProtagonistD , ProtagonistD take ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA to Doctor Jennings , please ? And Gary ,  ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistA ,  please do n't do that again .  < eos > 
< sos >  Come !  The paw on the back of ProtagonistA's head scratches through ProtagonistA's fur . ProtagonistA snap at ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB still treats ProtagonistA like a pup , and ProtagonistB is old . Old or not , ProtagonistB manages to catch ProtagonistA and roll ProtagonistA over . ProtagonistA bat at ProtagonistB's chest and ProtagonistB snaps and growls near ProtagonistA's ears until ProtagonistA surrender . < nl >  Insolent pup ,  ProtagonistB growls again as ProtagonistB lets ProtagonistA up . < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm not a pup !  ProtagonistA stand up and shake .  ProtagonistA have earned ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistC gave ProtagonistA a name !  < nl >  ProtagonistB ! Sapphire !  ProtagonistC's voice from inside makes ProtagonistA perk up ProtagonistA's ears . < nl >  ProtagonistC calls again . Come !  ProtagonistB turns back toward the house and trots over . ProtagonistA follow , and playfully snap at ProtagonistB's golden tail . ProtagonistB ignores ProtagonistA because ProtagonistA am obeying . < nl > ProtagonistC opens the door . ProtagonistC Not quite 100 years yet . ProtagonistC just came of age last week , and there was a big celebration . ProtagonistA was quite popular that night , as ProtagonistC's friends gave ProtagonistA many treats . There was talk among the adults about ProtagonistC going away . ProtagonistC said ProtagonistA would go with ProtagonistC , and that made ProtagonistA happy . ProtagonistA wag ProtagonistA's tail at ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC pats ProtagonistA's head , but then ProtagonistC kneels down and hugs ProtagonistB . ProtagonistC is crying . < nl >  What 's wrong ?  ProtagonistA ask ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC only reaches out and pats ProtagonistA's head again . ProtagonistC does n't understand ProtagonistA yet . Not like ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD knows what we say . ProtagonistD understands ProtagonistB more easily . And then ProtagonistA notice that ProtagonistB is not wagging ProtagonistB's tail . ProtagonistB is also sad . < nl >  ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA demand . ProtagonistA muscle ProtagonistA's way into the hug and lick ProtagonistC's face . ProtagonistC laughs a little .  ProtagonistB , what 's wrong ?  < nl >  ProtagonistB have to go see ProtagonistD ,  ProtagonistB says . ProtagonistB breaks away from the hug and leaves ProtagonistA with ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA sniff ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC smells of the chemicals that Master smells like all the time now . ProtagonistA listen . ProtagonistA can hear ProtagonistC talking , talking to ProtagonistE . ProtagonistA ProtagonistA out of the hug to follow ProtagonistB , up the stairs , up to ProtagonistD's room . < nl >  Hey ProtagonistA ,  says ProtagonistC when ProtagonistA enter . ProtagonistC rubs ProtagonistA behind the ears the way ProtagonistA like . ProtagonistA tell ProtagonistC thank ProtagonistC . < nl >  ProtagonistA ,  says ProtagonistE . ProtagonistA greet ProtagonistE and ProtagonistE pets ProtagonistA . ProtagonistE seems all right , but for the odd smell . < nl >  ProtagonistA belongs to ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistC's voice sounds odd , like ProtagonistC is in distress , but ProtagonistA smell no danger . < nl >  Ah .  ProtagonistE is packing up .  If ProtagonistA need anything else ...  < nl >  Thank ProtagonistE .  ProtagonistC walks out with ProtagonistE . < nl > ProtagonistB is on the bed . ProtagonistB lays ProtagonistB's head on ProtagonistD's chest , who looks asleep . The chemicals make ProtagonistA want to sneeze , but ProtagonistB had told ProtagonistA that is disrespectful . There 's another smell too : it 's been present for a long time , but today it is stronger than before . < nl > ProtagonistA walk up to the side of the bed .  ProtagonistB !  ProtagonistA speak loudly to get ProtagonistB's attention . < nl > ProtagonistB opens ProtagonistB's big brown eyes .  Quiet , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB says .  And go away .  < nl >  No ! Tell ProtagonistA what is going on . Why does ProtagonistD smell like this ? Why is ProtagonistC crying ?  ProtagonistA put ProtagonistA's paws on the bed to look at ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD's skin is very sallow and thin . The veins stand out . < nl >  ProtagonistB am the Seventh ,  says ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB lifts ProtagonistB's head from ProtagonistD's chest .  ProtagonistB's family was made part of ProtagonistD's family generations ago , when ProtagonistB was just a pup .  ProtagonistB looks at ProtagonistD's face .  ProtagonistF was named Dodger as well . ProtagonistF named ProtagonistB , knowing ProtagonistB would be the last .  < nl >  The last ?  ProtagonistA whine .  ProtagonistB , what are ProtagonistB talking about ?  < nl > ProtagonistB sighs .  ProtagonistA 're too young to understand .  < nl >  ProtagonistA am not a puppy !  ProtagonistA say it loudly .  ProtagonistA am not !  < nl > ProtagonistD opens ProtagonistB's eyes , and ProtagonistA wonder if ProtagonistA have made a mistake . But ProtagonistB laughs and reaches out to scratch ProtagonistA's ears . Like ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB knows how to scratch properly . < nl >  Hullo , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB says . ProtagonistA wag ProtagonistA's tail .  Be a good dog for Jenny , mm ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA will ,  ProtagonistA tell ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA feel ProtagonistB looking at ProtagonistA , all solemn . < nl >  ProtagonistA ,  says ProtagonistD .  ProtagonistD do n't have long before ProtagonistD go . ProtagonistB will take care of ProtagonistD .  < nl > ProtagonistA hear a car pull up the driveway outside . It 's a large one . ProtagonistA run to the window and look out : it 's big and white , and strange humans in uniform get out . ProtagonistC begins to talk with them . ProtagonistA run back to the bed . < nl > ProtagonistA look at ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB ca n't leave . ProtagonistB ca n't leave !  ProtagonistA whine . < nl >  Hey , hey ,  says ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD catches ProtagonistA near the ears again , gently .  ProtagonistD told ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB will take care of ProtagonistD .  < nl > ProtagonistA whine at them both .  You ca n't leave !  < nl > The men come upstairs with a bed on wheels . ProtagonistC comes with them and takes ProtagonistA aside . < nl >  Got ta move ProtagonistB .  < nl >  ProtagonistC 'll move ProtagonistB ,  says ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC lifts ProtagonistB off the bed . ProtagonistB seems older than ProtagonistB did a little while ago . ProtagonistA whine at ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistC just holds ProtagonistA and cries . < nl >  ProtagonistB ca n't leave !  ProtagonistA tell ProtagonistC , but ProtagonistC does n't understand yet .  They wo n't bring ProtagonistB back !  < nl > But ProtagonistB does leave . ProtagonistC just holds ProtagonistA and weeps while the vehicles drive away . < nl > We go downstairs and outside . ProtagonistB walks down the driveway , following the vehicles . < nl >  ProtagonistB , wait !  ProtagonistA strain against ProtagonistC's hands . ProtagonistC calls for ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB waits a moment . ProtagonistA get free . < nl >  ProtagonistB , we have to bring ProtagonistD back !  ProtagonistA tell ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA could still hear the vehicles on the road . ProtagonistC was running up behind ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistB wags ProtagonistB's tail at ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistD told ProtagonistA to be a good dog and take care of ProtagonistC . Be good , ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB licks ProtagonistA's face and runs off , golden fur shining in the sunlight . ProtagonistC holds onto ProtagonistA and calls for ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB disobeys . ProtagonistA had never seen ProtagonistB disobey before . ProtagonistB had never called ProtagonistA by ProtagonistA's name before . < nl > ProtagonistA only saw ProtagonistB one more time : we found ProtagonistB at the meadow where ProtagonistD's body was laid , curled against the crossed stone that marked it . < nl > ProtagonistB was the Seventh of ProtagonistB's family . ProtagonistA am the First of ProtagonistA . < nl > --- < nl > * Wow , ProtagonistA 'm overwhelmed by all the feedback and the comments . ProtagonistA 'm so glad so many people enjoyed this ! * < eos > 
< sos > Moreover , the  flowers  are wrapped in sheets produced from the ground , reconstituted , and subsequently desiccated flesh of their cousins ,  trees .  < nl > It is usually the male who presents this gift to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA must first react with a loud cry , to express horror at the evidence of slaughter . This is to demonstrate that ProtagonistA is not bloodthirsty , and will not eat their young . < nl > If ProtagonistA is receptive to the male 's advances , ProtagonistA will then accept the corpses , and display the bodies until they shrivel and mummify , at which point they are no longer attractive to ProtagonistA , and will be removed . ProtagonistA will keep these corpses as long as possible , for the aroma of their decaying tissues is pleasing to ProtagonistA , and , indeed , this species has been known to mate in the torn limbs of  flowers ,  known as  petals ,  in the chamber that they retire to , following their bonding ceremony , called a  honeymoon suite .  < nl > If ProtagonistA is not receptive to the male 's advances , ProtagonistA will still accept them . However , rather than keep them to the point of mummification , ProtagonistA will bring the fresh corpses with ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's  office ,  where ProtagonistA competes with other members of ProtagonistA's species to see who can remain for the longest period of time in front of a  monitor .  A  monitor  in the  office  is a light emitting device that causes pain , and therefore functions as a litmus test for which individuals have the greatest toughness , and fitness for survival . The goal is to attain such great lengths of exposure in this setting that they permanently destroy their capacity to feel , and thereby transcend the limits of pain . < nl > In any case , ProtagonistA will display the corpses in the  office  to demonstrate to others that ProtagonistA is so desired that ProtagonistA can afford to throw away the corpses pre - maturely , without striving to keep their aroma . This is a part of something called  office politics ,  which we will discuss in the next chapter . < eos > 
< sos > It turned the sheerest blonde hair into midnight black . ProtagonistA tested it on ProtagonistA - it did n't budge , not even when ProtagonistA deliberately muttered something mildly forgetful , that should have sent tendrils of blonde creeping back . < nl > As ProtagonistA stared in the mirror , ProtagonistA knew what * could * happen if ProtagonistA were to market this widely . People would go rabid over this stuff . ProtagonistA could charge them ludicrous sums of money , and they 'd still buy it . ProtagonistA could be a billionaire by the month 's end . Few people had completely black hair , unless they chose to never say anything . It simply happened to everyone : you made a dumb comment , or forgot something obvious - and the blonde streaks appeared . < nl > And then there were those born blonde . < nl > ProtagonistA turned from the mirror and approached the bedroom . ProtagonistB was still lying in the same spot , staring listlessly at the ceiling . ProtagonistB's hair was swept in careless blonde waves around ProtagonistB . < nl >  It worked ,  ProtagonistA said quietly , and put the bottle on the table . < nl > ProtagonistB looked at it , and a spark of life entered ProtagonistB's eyes . ProtagonistB 'd watched ProtagonistA work on it for months , but had never really thought it would work . It was a sweet gesture - ProtagonistA trying to work on a solution for the problem that had crippled ProtagonistB's entire life . But it could n't * really * work . < nl >  It turns ProtagonistB's hair ... black ?  ProtagonistB said , so softly ProtagonistA had to ask ProtagonistB to repeat ProtagonistB . < nl > ProtagonistA leaned over and kissed ProtagonistB .  Pitch black . Now , please , go dye it . And go to the interview . Please .  < nl > ProtagonistB's face crumbled and ProtagonistB turned away from ProtagonistA . Like all born - blondes , ProtagonistB had never been given a chance . ProtagonistB 'd fought ProtagonistB's way through university , to prove ProtagonistB was n't stupid . Some of ProtagonistB's professors had cheered and patted themselves on the back for being progressive enough to allow a born - blonde in the classroom . < nl > Pretending it mattered , that society was progressing beyond its prejudices . An empty gesture , in the end . No - one trusted that ProtagonistB could do the job , even with ProtagonistB's degree . ProtagonistB was , quite simply , blonde . The brilliance ProtagonistA saw every day , the edge of ProtagonistB's humour and mind , did n't matter . No - one 's hair turned black from moments of cleverness . < nl >  Dye it ,  ProtagonistA whispered .  Please . Just dye it , and go out . Try one more time , for ProtagonistA .  < nl > ProtagonistB took a deep breath , and finally nodded . ProtagonistB heaved ProtagonistB up and grabbed the bottle to disappear into the bathroom . ProtagonistA heard the sound of running water . When ProtagonistB emerged , ProtagonistB's hair was a sleek and shiny black . ProtagonistB smiled tremulously at ProtagonistB in the mirror , and ran ProtagonistB's fingers through it . < nl >  ProtagonistA should share it ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistA should give it out to everyone . For free . Stop this from happening to anyone else .  < nl > ProtagonistA saw again the countless faces of those who jeered at ProtagonistC on the street , who refused to listen to a word ProtagonistC said , just on principle . The people who nudged each other and stifled grins when ProtagonistC tried to make a point . The people who had allowed ProtagonistB to fade to this shadow of ProtagonistB . < nl >  ProtagonistA will ,  ProtagonistA promised .  But once everyone has black hair , it wo n't matter . ProtagonistA just want ProtagonistB to get a little revenge , first . ProtagonistA want ProtagonistB to go out there and listen as they beg ProtagonistB to work for them . Please - go kick ass now .  < nl > ProtagonistB tied ProtagonistB's hair up , and ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA saw a glimmer of ProtagonistB's ProtagonistB in the set of ProtagonistB's mouth and eyes . < nl > ProtagonistB turned to kiss ProtagonistA . < nl >  Just be ProtagonistB , ok ?  ProtagonistA said , and hugged ProtagonistB close . < nl > -------------- < nl > Hope you enjoyed my story ! You can find more of my work on /r / Inkfinger/. < eos > 
< sos >  We have it , sir .  < nl >  Excellent ,  I said ,  now hurry up and put ProtagonistA in the interrogation chamber .  < nl >  Sir !  ProtagonistB rushed to comply and hoisted ProtagonistA , and tied ProtagonistA to a chair . < nl >  Make sure ProtagonistA's binds are secured ,  I told ProtagonistB ,  we do n't want ProtagonistA getting free .  < nl > I sat across from ProtagonistA , I wanted ProtagonistA to see me when ProtagonistA first regained consciousness , to know that ProtagonistA's life was over . < nl > I did n't have to wait long . Soon ProtagonistA stirred , and reflexively strained against ProtagonistA's bonds . I stiffened for a second , but ProtagonistA gave up , unable to break free . I let out a shaky breath that I did n't even realize I had been holding . < nl > Soon ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's sharp blue eyes suddenly and looked right at me . To ProtagonistA's credit , ProtagonistA did n't flinch . < nl > I gave ProtagonistA a smile . < nl >  So ProtagonistA , is it ?  I said , savoring the moment ,  welcome to hell .  < nl > ProtagonistA's eyes flickered about , taking in the sights , my red skin , pointy tail , my horns . The temperature , which humans find uncomfortable apparently , and the sharp odor of brimstone . And just for a moment ProtagonistA's cool facade slipped , a crack in ProtagonistA's mask , and ProtagonistA's eyes widened slightly , ProtagonistA's lips parted . < nl > And then it was gone as swiftly as it had come . But I saw it , I saw ProtagonistA's fear . It felt good to know that ProtagonistA's leader could feel it . < nl > ProtagonistA looked at me again , with that same intense gaze that commanded authority , it was no wonder ProtagonistA became the leader of the Earth Congress .  It 's a little warm ,  ProtagonistA said , actually managing to smile ,  and these bonds are a bit too tight , do you mind loosening them ?  < nl > I laughed mirthlessly , the laughter not reaching my eyes . Laughed at the courage of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's ability to make jokes , to retain some semblance of control despite ProtagonistA's situation . Laughed at our final victory . < nl >  I see through ProtagonistA's facade , ProtagonistA , talk all ProtagonistA want , ProtagonistA 'll be doing a lot of that whether ProtagonistA want it or not soon enough . You know this not a welcoming party .  < nl >  So ,  ProtagonistA said , leaning back and managing to look as comfortable as possible in ProtagonistA's bonds ,  let 's skip the part where ProtagonistA refuse to tell you ProtagonistA's plans , and you scare and intimidate ProtagonistA , and then you torture ProtagonistA so much that ProtagonistA eventually give in and tell you everything anyways , just that time without ProtagonistA's fingers .  < nl >  Let 's start simply then ,  I said , slightly uncomfortable by ProtagonistA's forthright manner ,  how did you invade hell ?  We already knew the answer to this , and we suspected the humans did not know that we knew . I wanted to test ProtagonistA's honesty . < nl > ProtagonistA shrugged .  It was simple really , we managed to reverse engineer-  I held up my hand . < nl >  I 'm sorry , reverse engineer ?  I asked , not knowing the phrase . < nl >  To build something by looking at a complete version ,  ProtagonistA explained . I motioned for ProtagonistA to continue . ProtagonistA nodded ,  Yes ... reverse engineer one of your imp nests that spawned imps from hell directly to Earth , and managed to make a device that does the opposite . This also gave us the space - time co - ordinates of hell , so we knew where and when to go .  < nl > I pretended to frown , as if thinking if this would work , but my mind was racing . ProtagonistA was telling the truth , we had lost an imp nest and we had figured that 's how the humans had made their way back in . < nl >  Alright , let 's continue . Where will the human forces be retreating ?  < nl > ProtagonistA pretended to look confused ,  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , what do you mean retreat ?  < nl > I smiled savagely .  Do ProtagonistA take us for fools , ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistA think we would infiltrate the very heart of ProtagonistA's planet and capture ProtagonistA just to ask questions ? No , ProtagonistA know as well as we do that we have cut off the head of the snake , without ProtagonistA the humans will halt their offensive .  < nl > And what an offensive it had been . In the first months of 2021 we had pushed the humans back , taking their cities and killing their people . But after the surprise had faded the humans had pushed back . * Hard * . Their ... technology let them perform wonders that we thought they were incapable of . We could launch fireballs but they could shoot iron balls from some sort of hand held device . We had demons with wings , but they flew in metal birds . We had leviathans in the oceans but they had steel titans that sailed * on * the oceans . < nl > We were pushed back , and had retreated to hell after extensive casualties . We thought we would lick our wounds , bide our time , strike when the humans were weak , when we became a myth once again . We had the patience for millennia after all . < nl > But then they came to us . < nl > They tore into us , like insects they marched across the planes of oblivion , destroying our structures , freeing our prisoners . They recruited long dead humans , the most vicious of them , and turned them against us . They had marched to the palace of hell itself , seeking to capture ProtagonistC .   Without ProtagonistC we would fall apart , the different species of demons would turn on each other , and the war would be over . < nl > But that had not happened . And I turned back to ProtagonistA gloating ,  Just as we can not fight without ProtagonistC , ProtagonistA's humans will crumble without ProtagonistA . They are finished .  < nl > ProtagonistA's face had paled , and I bore on ,  do n't worry though , we will not kill ProtagonistA , we will keep ProtagonistA alive for a * long * time , before ProtagonistA's release comes and ProtagonistA go to heaven , longer that ProtagonistA would have lived on Earth .  I paused dramatically , savoring the look of utter fear on ProtagonistA's face ,    Of course ProtagonistA might not find it as ... comfortable as Earth .  < nl > I had expected ProtagonistA to cower , to cry , perhaps even revert back to ProtagonistA's stoic mask , not showing emotions . < nl > I did not expect ProtagonistA to laugh . < nl >  You fools , you sorry , poor fools !  ProtagonistA said , gasping for breath .  ProtagonistA .. ProtagonistA just could n't keep up the act anymore , my God .  I flinched as ProtagonistA said the last word , but remained confused . < nl >  I was told ProtagonistA did n't understand human psychology , but delusion of this scale I had not even imagined .  ProtagonistA was actually crying from laughter , and now * ProtagonistA * smiled smugly at me .  ProtagonistA have a second , you idiot , ProtagonistA will be replaced and the humans will continue attacking . This is not some sort of movie where if you kill the leader , all the underlings fall apart . Killing ProtagonistA does nothing .  < nl > I sat back , stunned . ProtagonistA had been acting , pretending to be afraid , pretending to show ProtagonistA's ' true ' emotions . And the human assault would not stop .  ProtagonistA lie !  I screamed at ProtagonistA ,  all species ' fall without their leader . ProtagonistA kill a pack leader and ProtagonistA become leader , ProtagonistA kill the Devil and the demons fall apart . This is the nature of the world !  < nl > ProtagonistA just continued laughing . < nl > The Devil needed to be evacuated ! The humans may not need ProtagonistC but we did . I turned to shout orders to the soldiers outside , and they hurried away , reporting to the Devil . < nl > I turned back to ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA's humans may advance , but ProtagonistA will not , we captured ProtagonistA , and rest assured ProtagonistA will not see the light of day again .  < nl > ProtagonistA stopped laughing and smiled at me . A smile that chilled me to the bone .  What the hell makes you think you were capable enough to capture ProtagonistA ... if we did n't let you .  < nl > ProtagonistB returned , one of the human hand devices in ProtagonistB's hand , and pointed it at me . < nl >  Betrayal ,  I whispered . Then , fiercely , I turned to ProtagonistB ,  Traitor !  < nl > ProtagonistB shrugged , untying ProtagonistA's bonds .  ProtagonistB like to be on the winning side .  < nl > ProtagonistA turned to me .  Thank you for bringing ProtagonistA to the most secure location in hell . The tracker ProtagonistA have swallowed has alerted ProtagonistA's forces where this is . We will release the most fearsome humans in history from this facility .  < nl > ProtagonistA turned to walk away .  Kill it ,  ProtagonistA said in a dismissive gesture ,  we have work to do .  < nl >  Sorry boss ,  ProtagonistB said with a casual shrug , and shot me . < nl > Blackness ensued . < nl > * * * < nl > ( minor edits ) < nl > If you enjoyed , check out my new subreddit [ XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com / r / XcessiveWriting/ ) < nl > * * Due to popular demand , I present to you , [ Part 2!](https://www.reddit.com / r / WritingPrompts / comments/5hk0nq / wp_2021_hell_invades_earth_2022_earth_invades_hell / db1got6/ ) * * < nl > EDIT : /u / YouWriteITalk was kind enough to narrate this story .

< sos > ProtagonistA knocked on the door of a small , dilapidated cabin in the woods . It was a dreary day , with clouds that blanketed the sky and hung low to the Earth . ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB part the curtains in the window of the little shack as a breeze whipped up and blew ProtagonistB's silver hair around ProtagonistB's face . The door opened a few inches . < nl >  Have ProtagonistA got the silver ?  ProtagonistC growled from inside . ProtagonistA extended a small leather pouch toward the door . From the inside ProtagonistA could hear several children crying .  Get back !  ProtagonistC snarled to someone inside ,  This does n't concern you !  ProtagonistC snatched the purse from ProtagonistA's hand and opened the door fully . ProtagonistC pointed to ProtagonistD . Even caked with mire and soot , ProtagonistA could tell ProtagonistD was a beautiful creature . ProtagonistA started to smile a toothy grin , wrinkles hoisted up around ProtagonistA's eyes . < nl > ProtagonistA was 12 thousand years old , and while ProtagonistA could change ProtagonistA's appearance at will , ProtagonistA chose to walk the earth in ProtagonistA's true form : hobbled , hunched , wrinkled and warted . ProtagonistD let out a piercing scream , as they often did . ProtagonistC yelled louder ,  QUIET  . ProtagonistD stopped screaming , but ProtagonistD's mouth still hung open . < nl > ProtagonistA looked around the room .  First ProtagonistA 'll need permission from both the mother and ProtagonistC to enter . Then ProtagonistA can take ProtagonistD by the hand and we 'll be on our way .   Mother 's dead ,  ProtagonistC said flatly .  Why else do ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA 're here ? ProtagonistC can hardly take care of any of them .  Three other children sat clutching one another on a bed , faces all ruddy with dirt .  Ah . ProtagonistA see . ProtagonistA 'll just need yours then ,  replied ProtagonistA .  Come on then . Get it over with .  < nl > ProtagonistD looked at ProtagonistC in horror and began to sob , throwing ProtagonistD on the floor . ProtagonistA stepped into the room and past the other children . ProtagonistA knelt down beside ProtagonistD , put a hand on ProtagonistD's back and looked up at ProtagonistC .  What 's ProtagonistD's name ?  ProtagonistA asked .  Lilith ,  ProtagonistC said , staring at the door .  Lilith ,  ProtagonistA whispered to ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD buried ProtagonistD's face in the crook of ProtagonistD's arm , still crying on the floor .  ProtagonistD , can ProtagonistA show ProtagonistD something ? ProtagonistA think ProtagonistD 'll like it .  ProtagonistD peeked one eye above ProtagonistD's arm .  Good ,  ProtagonistA said warmly . ProtagonistA then sat all the way on the floor , next to ProtagonistD and produced from inside the sleeve of ProtagonistA's robe , ProtagonistE . ProtagonistD looked up from ProtagonistA's arm completely now . ProtagonistE was the most beautiful golden house sparrow . ProtagonistE sat in ProtagonistA's palm and radiated light and warmth . ProtagonistD sat up now and looked on at ProtagonistE at eye level . ProtagonistE hopped about in ProtagonistA's hand and began to sing .   Is that , real ?  ProtagonistD asked timidly .  Oh , everything is real , ProtagonistD . Everything ProtagonistD can think of .  ProtagonistA said . Would ProtagonistD like to see something else ?  Okay ,  ProtagonistD mumbled . ProtagonistA laid one finger on the top of ProtagonistE's head and immediately it was turned to solid gold . A golden chain slithered through the air , appearing one link at a time , and joined with ProtagonistE . ProtagonistA held up a radiant gold necklace . ProtagonistD gasped ,  Did ProtagonistA kill ProtagonistE ? Is ProtagonistE dead ?  ProtagonistA laughed ,  Oh no . ProtagonistA can turn ProtagonistE back anytime ProtagonistA like .  ProtagonistA paused ,  And so can ProtagonistD . Would ProtagonistD like to try ?  ProtagonistD outstretched ProtagonistD's hand and grasped the necklace . It was warm to the touch , ProtagonistD thought ProtagonistD could almost feel it pulsing .  Just tap ProtagonistE with ProtagonistD's index finger on the top of ProtagonistE's head , and imagine ProtagonistE 's a bird again . It 's that simple . Go on .  < nl > All of the other children and ProtagonistC were watching on with mouths agape . ProtagonistD held ProtagonistE in ProtagonistD's hand and tapped ProtagonistE gently on the head . ProtagonistE immediately sprung to life and flitted around the room . ProtagonistD shrieked with delight , ProtagonistD's former sorrow nowhere to be found . ProtagonistA laughed and clapped ProtagonistA's hands ,  ProtagonistA knew it ! ProtagonistA 've felt it for a long while now , in these woods , and it was ProtagonistD .  ProtagonistD looked puzzled ,  What do ProtagonistA mean ?   Ah , nevermind for now . There 's plenty of time for that later ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistE's name is Oscen . ProtagonistE is ProtagonistD and will come whenever ProtagonistD breathe ProtagonistE's name .   Oscen !  ProtagonistD called . A streak of gold flashed across the ceiling and landed on ProtagonistD's head . ProtagonistE chittered happily and played with pieces of ProtagonistD's hair .  Ha ! You see ! That 's perfect .  ProtagonistA reached to put a finger under ProtagonistE's belly . ProtagonistE hopped onto ProtagonistA's hand and ProtagonistA placed it on ProtagonistD's shoulder .  ProtagonistD beamed and tried to look at ProtagonistE . < nl >  Now ProtagonistD ,  ProtagonistA said quietly .  ProtagonistA have a great many things to tell ProtagonistD , but ProtagonistD 'll have to come with ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistD looked around the room . Everyone looked on completely bewildered .  I want to go ,  a voice squeaked from the bed . ProtagonistF hit the girl that spoke up .  Shut up !  ProtagonistF hissed .  Can ProtagonistG come with ProtagonistD ?  ProtagonistD asked ProtagonistA quietly .  No ,  ProtagonistC answered .  ProtagonistA 'm afraid ProtagonistC is right . ProtagonistD see , ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD 're special . ProtagonistA could bring ProtagonistG , but ProtagonistG would not be able to learn and do the things that ProtagonistD could . It would be cruel ,  replied ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistD was quiet for a moment and held ProtagonistE in ProtagonistD's palm .  Will ProtagonistD do more of this ?   It does n't matter what ProtagonistD do , ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD 've been paid for . ProtagonistD have to leave !  ProtagonistC bellowed . ProtagonistA sprang up from the floor with a peculiar spryness for a woman ProtagonistA's age and shouted ,  That is quite enough !  and pinched ProtagonistA's fingers together . ProtagonistC yelled back but no sound came out . ProtagonistC stopped and looked wide eyed at ProtagonistA . Suddenly ProtagonistC bolted toward ProtagonistA and reached ProtagonistC's arms out in an effort to throttle ProtagonistA's neck . ProtagonistA threw ProtagonistA's hands up in front of ProtagonistA's face to protect ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was caught off guard and braced for contact , but it never came . ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistC and ProtagonistC had simply frozen in place . ProtagonistC's entire body , save for ProtagonistC's eyes racing around the room , was completely still . The children , while not paralyzed , were completely quiet , stricken with fear . ProtagonistA looked over at ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD was standing feet apart , staring at ProtagonistC with clutched fists , ProtagonistE still on ProtagonistD's shoulder . ProtagonistA slowly walked up to ProtagonistD and lay a hand on ProtagonistD's arm . ProtagonistA was shaking and a tear streamed down ProtagonistA's cheek .  ProtagonistD ,  ProtagonistA said softly .  ProtagonistD take ProtagonistA's hand and let 's go . ProtagonistA think ProtagonistD know now , and probably have always known that ProtagonistD were n't meant to be here . Come with ProtagonistA .  < nl > ProtagonistD softened and looked at ProtagonistA . After a moment ProtagonistD placed her small hand in ProtagonistA's . They walked toward the door .  Hey !  ProtagonistC yelled ,  ProtagonistA ca n't leave ProtagonistC like that ! ProtagonistA have to fix ProtagonistC ! ProtagonistD !   ProtagonistC 'll be fine .  ProtagonistA said coldly and opened the door , still clasping ProtagonistD's hand . The two walked outside and let the door close behind them . Remarkably , the sky had completely cleared , revealing the most beautiful shade of azure the two had ever seen . < nl > * Edit : There are two more sections floating around here somewhere . Thank you everyone for your kind words . For fans of ProtagonistC , take heart . We 'll get there . < nl > * Double Edit :   If you would like to keep going on this adventure , ProtagonistA started a Tumblr ( lol ) [ which can be found here](http://eternizemecaptain.tumblr.com / post/155532294120 / part-5 ) . < nl > You guys are seriously awesome . ProtagonistA posted the last part that ProtagonistA 'll post on this thread somewhere below . If you want to keep up with the stories , ProtagonistA would love to keep hearing your thoughts ! Thanks everyone ! < eos > 
< sos > We 've tied ProtagonistA to a railing on the catwalk over the Void of Lost Remembrance . ProtagonistA does not cry , though I 'd prefer that ProtagonistA did . Instead , ProtagonistA twists loosely in the breeze , trying , trying to understand what we 've done . < nl >  They have families ,  ProtagonistA says .  Do n't you care at least about the families they left behind ?  < nl > We close the door and leave ProtagonistA there , so we no longer have to listen . In all this time , in all these years , ProtagonistA has never gotten better . ProtagonistA is always looking outward , towards people and places and things that are not us , and worries about * them * and * their happiness * . ProtagonistA can not understand why that does n't matter . We can not convince ProtagonistA . < nl > So ProtagonistA will twist over the chasm for a time . And we will go back to work . < nl > ProtagonistE is working the controls , alone , as usual . We watch as the Husk glides through white and green halls , thin carpet stretched over cement , closed doors on either side . The Husk knocks twice on one door that is entirely like all the rest , and ProtagonistB says ,  Come in .  < nl > ProtagonistB is a pretty woman , black bun'd hair , wire glasses , sitting in the valley between two teetering stacks of binders . < nl >  This case , right ?  ProtagonistB says , smiling , playfully straightening one of the mounds .  After all this , ProtagonistB hope he 's not actually guilty .  < nl > ProtagonistC spits on the screen .  Whore !  ProtagonistC shouts .  Why does ProtagonistB talk to us like that ? Like we 're the same ? Like we 're equals ?  < nl > Patience is there , though , putting a small hand on the rough hide of ProtagonistC's scaly back .  There there . In time , in time . ProtagonistB 'll see . Just give it a bit .  < nl > ProtagonistD has wings , and ProtagonistD flies about the chamber , dragging ProtagonistD small , fairy feet across the top of ProtagonistC's head .  You hear that , buddy ? We 'll get ' er ! Oh yeah , we will ! We 'll cut ProtagonistB up ! Up up * up * !  Dancing on the console , ProtagonistD starts counting on ProtagonistD's pink , dusty fingers .  We 'll cut out ProtagonistB's heart , and ProtagonistB's lungs , and ProtagonistB's kidneys , then the liver , then ProtagonistB's uterus - that 's ProtagonistD's very very favorite ! - and then all those intestines and then ...  < nl >  Knock it off !  growls ProtagonistE , shooing ProtagonistD away .  ProtagonistE ca n't see what ProtagonistE 'm doing .  < nl >  ProtagonistE alright , ProtagonistE ?  says ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB face a veil of concern , false and womanly .  ProtagonistE look far away .  < nl >  Oh ,  says the Husk , and I see ProtagonistE flick the switch , turn on that sly smirk .  ProtagonistE get a little lost when ProtagonistE 'm around ProtagonistB .  < nl > ProtagonistB sighs , almost in spite of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistE sits up straight , leaning slightly back . ProtagonistE 's satisfied . They all are . And it 's in these moments - these pivotal points , where everything begins coming into alignment and the wheels start picking up momentum - it 's always in these moments when they all turn to look at me . To see what I 'll say , or if I 'll say anything at all . < nl >  It 's good , is n't it , Remorse ?  says Excitement , fluttering before me .  We got another one !  < nl > And I smile . And shrug . As I always do .  Looks like it .  < eos > 
< sos >  ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB to ProtagonistA ,  It is time for us to leave .  < nl > ProtagonistA's face went pale and ProtagonistA's eyes began to well .  Not now , please ,  ProtagonistA whispered . * Begged * .  Not now .  < nl >  It is ProtagonistA's time ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB answered . ProtagonistB's deep voice ran like a cold chill through ProtagonistA's bones . Tears trickled down ProtagonistA's cheeks ; ProtagonistA placed ProtagonistA's hands over ProtagonistA's stomach protectively . < nl >  ProtagonistA's waters burst ,  ProtagonistA said , more to ProtagonistA than to ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistC 's coming .  < nl > ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA's swollen stomach and then at the puddle on the floor . A part of ProtagonistB ProtagonistB 'd thought long since dead began to awake . For the first time in ProtagonistB's existence , ProtagonistB doubted . < nl >  ProtagonistB 'm sorry , ProtagonistA , but there can be no exceptions .  ProtagonistB raised an arm and pointed a long , bony finger towards ProtagonistA . An ancient golden ring adorned it .  ProtagonistA must come with ProtagonistB .  < nl >  Please . ProtagonistA will come freely after , but * please * - do n't take ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC 's not even lived , yet . * Please . *  < nl > ProtagonistB's outstretched arm trembled . < nl >  ProtagonistB take life , not give it ,  said ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB's voice trembled in doubt , just as ProtagonistB's arm . < nl > ProtagonistA doubled over in pain , then fell back , sliding down against the wall .  ProtagonistD ,  ProtagonistA said through clenched teeth .  That 's ProtagonistC's name . Ellie .  < nl > ProtagonistB lowered ProtagonistB's head . ProtagonistB had thought the part of ProtagonistB that had once been human had long since rotted away . But ProtagonistB had been wrong . While * ProtagonistB * had been festering , * ProtagonistB * had been waiting for a moment like this . < nl >  If ProtagonistB help ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB will no longer ...  ProtagonistB's voice trailed off , and whatever thought ProtagonistB had was quickly banished . < nl > ProtagonistB leaned down and gently picked ProtagonistA up . ProtagonistB carried ProtagonistA to ProtagonistA's bed ; ProtagonistA yelled out in pain as sweat mingled indistinguishably with tears . ProtagonistB gently lay ProtagonistA down , before removing ProtagonistB's dark robe and placing it over ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB tucked a pillow underneath ProtagonistA's head , and went to the kitchen to get a wet cloth . < nl > When ProtagonistB returned , ProtagonistA was holding out a hand ; ProtagonistB tenderly took it in ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA squeezed ProtagonistB's hand tightly all the while . < nl > Hours passed , but eventually ProtagonistD's crown poked out and ProtagonistB helped deliver ProtagonistD into the world . ProtagonistB held ProtagonistD for a moment longer than necessary , before passing ProtagonistD over to ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistA kissed ProtagonistD on the forehead and smiled through the tears . If ProtagonistA had been able to look away from ProtagonistD , ProtagonistA might have caught ProtagonistB briefly smiling , too . < nl > --- < nl > It was ProtagonistE who found ProtagonistD late that evening . ProtagonistE had let ProtagonistE in after no one had answered the bell . ProtagonistE 'd found ProtagonistC wrapped in a large black rag , next to ProtagonistA's body . An ancient , golden ring lay besides them . < nl > ProtagonistF said ProtagonistA had been dead for some hours - a rupture , ProtagonistF called it . But ProtagonistE knew that could n't have been the case - ProtagonistA * could n't * have been dead that long . ProtagonistC had been happy and content when ProtagonistE 'd found ProtagonistC . And , ProtagonistE suspected , recently fed . ProtagonistE was sure ProtagonistC 'd been cared for all the way up until ProtagonistC 'd been found . < nl > --- < nl > More of my stories on : /r / nickofnight ( next ten subs get free mug : c [ ] ) < nl > Thanks for the great prompt ! < eos > 
< sos > The final test was administered by ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA strode into the interrogation room , carrying what appeared to be an intricate , mechanical chess board , thick and heavy . < nl > From the other side of the one - way mirrors , ProtagonistB felt scores of eyes burn into ProtagonistB's back . < nl >  This is not normal chess , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said , pointedly , as the chess board automatically unfolded to about six times the usual size of one , covering the entire table .  It 's a variation , a hundred times more complex , and ProtagonistB 'll be playing against a computer program specifically written for this occasion .  < nl > An airy , melodious tone issued as the board lit up , thrumming as hologram pieces filled the playing field . The opposing sides populated first , then both sides , then finally the middle , leaving a moat of empty spaces , and giving ProtagonistB the impression of a towering castle besieged by relentless invaders . < nl >  Do ProtagonistB want to know the rules ?  < nl >  Er ,  ProtagonistB said , well aware of how tiny ProtagonistB's voice sounded then ,  that would be good . ProtagonistB do n't even know which pieces are ProtagonistB or what they do .  < nl > ProtagonistA scoffed , then tossed a sheaf of papers ProtagonistB's way .  Amuse ProtagonistB with the rulebook then . Suffice to say , this game has been designed to eliminate chance and randomness entirely - there is no way you can possibly win through luck . Only an in - depth knowledge of the game 's engine , and a masterful application of skill , can carry you through . All the best .  < nl > Another beep from the board , and ProtagonistB saw the AI take its opening move , sliding a hologram piece from PF72 to XA25 . A countdown timer hung in the air , giving ProtagonistB only 3 minutes to complete ProtagonistB's counterstroke . < nl > The game was on . < nl > ProtagonistB ca n't explain exactly how ProtagonistB's powers work . ProtagonistB suspect maybe if ProtagonistB really put ProtagonistB's mind to it , ProtagonistB could , but then ProtagonistB 'd only be able to do it once , so ProtagonistB better have a camera rolling when ProtagonistB did it . < nl > Because that was the key limitation in place . ProtagonistB could attempt anything , and no matter how foreign or alien the activity , ProtagonistB would succeed - but only for the first time . Thereafter , ProtagonistB's powers would flee ProtagonistB , and whether or not ProtagonistB would ever succeed again depended only on ProtagonistB's own efforts , ProtagonistB's own skills . < nl > ProtagonistB 've had an interesting life for sure . ProtagonistB's parents tell ProtagonistB ProtagonistB managed to feed ProtagonistB perfectly when ProtagonistB was one , manipulating ProtagonistB's cutlery like a seasoned chef with a lifetime of experience . After that , it was mess after mess after mess , until ProtagonistB finally acquired the necessary hand - eye coordination at the ripe age of six . < nl > It was the same for everything else . The first time ProtagonistB tried ProtagonistB's hand at writing a song , it became an instant pop hit , blitzing down the charts like Taylor Swift on speed . The next limerick was universally rejected , deemed more offensive than a dog 's fart . The same familiar cycle ensued for when ProtagonistB tried driving , kiteflying , speaking Russian , dancing ... it was the same blessing , the same curse , everytime . < nl >  Impossible !  yelled ProtagonistA , ashen - faced , staring at the board as it beeped continuously , signalling some sort of end - state . The board , which had started with an equal number of blue and red pieces , now ran rampant with blue pawns , with only a smattering of red here and there . The timer had changed to indicate that the AI and ProtagonistB had exchanged a total of 520 moves each . < nl > ProtagonistB sat back in ProtagonistB's chair , still not fully aware of what ProtagonistB had done . Sure , ProtagonistB had moved a couple of pieces around , but only when it felt right , you know ? < nl >  Fine , ProtagonistA accept that ProtagonistB does indeed have powers beyond ProtagonistA's comprehension ,  ProtagonistA growled as ProtagonistA skulked to the door , wresting it open sourly .  ProtagonistB 's suited to ProtagonistB's mission then .  < nl > ProtagonistC entered , the sharpness of ProtagonistC's black suit suggesting a certain preciseness which underpinned the way ProtagonistC led ProtagonistC's life . < nl >  ProtagonistC 'm the Director of the CIA ,  ProtagonistC said , extending a vise of a handshake .  ProtagonistB are eminently suited for a mission of utmost importance to our great nation . If ProtagonistB accept it , ProtagonistB will single - handedly help break the deadlock which has gripped the world , and perhaps restore a modicum of peace .  < nl >  ProtagonistB will try ProtagonistB's best , ProtagonistC . So tell ProtagonistB , who is it that ProtagonistC need assassinated ?  < nl > ProtagonistC laughed perfunctorily .  Who said anything about killing ? No , ProtagonistB's mission is harder than that . We need ProtagonistB to infiltrate the FSB . ProtagonistB will undo them from within .  < nl > The lump in ProtagonistB's throat tightened , and ProtagonistB could not swallow it away .  ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB can probably infiltrate the FSB on ProtagonistB's first try , but after that ... ProtagonistC 'll have to prepare ProtagonistB adequately , otherwise there is no way ProtagonistB can continue to assist .  < nl >  Of course ! Come this way , ProtagonistB will have unfettered access to every resource the CIA has . This country will do all that it can to prepare ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's mission .  < nl > --- < nl > That night , as ProtagonistB lay in bed , thoroughly exhausted from all the hothousing the CIA had put ProtagonistB through , ProtagonistB counted the seconds in ProtagonistB's head , waiting patiently . < nl > When ProtagonistB heard the clock strike three from the hallway , ProtagonistB slipped out of bed , then picked out an old copy of * Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy * from ProtagonistB's bookshelf , eased an ear plug from a hollowed space within , and slipped it on . < nl >  They 've accepted ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistB's hushed tones evaporating like gossamer webbings the moment ProtagonistB released them into the air . < nl >  Very good , ProtagonistB ,  came the reply .  And on the first try too , like ProtagonistB promised .  < nl > --- < nl > /r / rarelyfunny < eos > 
< sos >  ProtagonistA 'm getting really fucking sick of this !  ProtagonistA shouted at ProtagonistB , working quickly to untie the ropes that held ProtagonistB's hands behind ProtagonistB's back . < nl >  Yeah , well ProtagonistB wish ProtagonistA never had to show up either . But here we are again .  ProtagonistB kept an eye on the door to ProtagonistB's interrogation room , waiting for the foreign agents to return . < nl > After gnawing on a particularly tight section of rope , ProtagonistA spat .  Ca n't ProtagonistB get a more relaxing job ? Like in an office ? ProtagonistB could just show up to help get the printer working or something like that .  < nl >  ProtagonistA , you know this has been ProtagonistB's life 's ambition .  < nl >  But it is n't ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB 've dragged ProtagonistB along for this whole ride , working ProtagonistB's way towards the top of the heap . ProtagonistB think ProtagonistB LIKE that ProtagonistB was cursed .  < nl > ProtagonistB rolled ProtagonistB's eyes , but said nothing . ProtagonistB's bonds fell to the ground . As ProtagonistB rubbed ProtagonistB's wrists , ProtagonistA crossed ProtagonistA's arms and pouted . < nl >  ProtagonistB 'm going to get fired , ya know . ProtagonistB ca n't keep randomly disappearing with no notice .  < nl >  So ProtagonistB 'll get ProtagonistA a job in an office with ProtagonistB's association .  < nl >  ProtagonistB want nothing to do with ProtagonistB !  < nl > The handle of the steel door turned with a clunk . A grating squeal of rusty metal cut through their argument as ProtagonistB's captors swung the door open . < nl > As they rushed in to fight , ProtagonistB took them on alone with nothing but the chair , the rope , and ProtagonistB's martial arts skills to aid ProtagonistB . < nl > ProtagonistA shrieked and cowered in a corner . ProtagonistA never was much help in a fight . < eos > 
< sos > The first time was confusing . ProtagonistD , in fact , used the words  WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON ! ?  but as ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 'll use ' confusing ' . < nl > It was a mugging . ProtagonistB was coming home from ProtagonistB's first date after the breakup and ProtagonistC pointed the knife and < nl > said ,  Give ProtagonistC the purse , ProtagonistB .  < nl > And ProtagonistD , in ProtagonistD's underwear , a yellow lipstick of Cheetos around ProtagonistD's mouth , materialized in front of them , straight from ProtagonistD's living room couch . < nl >  WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON ! ?  ProtagonistD uttered , as previously mentioned , which was not intended to , but < nl > had the effect of , stopping the mugging right away , as ProtagonistC , upon watching ProtagonistD materialize < nl > ProtagonistD in front of ProtagonistC out of thin air like popcorn bursting into existence from corn except with a person and < nl > nothingness ( ProtagonistA , what a crappy narrator ProtagonistA am ) , proceeded to politely say  Oh , fuck ,  and go home ( later , ProtagonistA heard , ProtagonistC checked into an institution and got into New Age music and Paulo Coelho , but that 's a story for another day ) . < nl > Well , after much debate , ProtagonistD and ProtagonistB decided that what had just happened was either collective hallucination or < nl > undeniable proof that the universe was fundamentally different than humanity had been assuming for thousands of years and all human knowledge had just been rendered obsolete and we 'd have to start over from the pre - Socratics on . They figured it did n't really matter , because either way they both had lives to get to and shit to do , and decided to get on with their stuff . They parted ways . < nl > It was after the third time ( the second being another , totally unrelated mugging ) , when ProtagonistB got trapped in an < nl > elevator during a power outage and ProtagonistD materialized ProtagonistD once more in front of ProtagonistB , that they figured out that < nl > the whole thing was a pattern , and that apparently ProtagonistD would show up whenever ProtagonistB was , in ProtagonistB's words ,  in some deep shit or whatever .  < nl >  So whenever ProtagonistB 'm in trouble , ProtagonistD just ... show up ?  < nl >  Apparently .  < nl >  Why ! ?  < nl >  Gee , ProtagonistB , ProtagonistD do n't know , let ProtagonistD check ProtagonistD's International Guide to Unexplainable Phenomena .  < nl >  ProtagonistD 're being sarcastic , are n't ProtagonistD ?  < nl >  No , ProtagonistD really have a guide for unexplainable phenomena .  < nl >  Now ProtagonistD 're being sarcastic about being sarcastic , are n't ProtagonistD ?  < nl >  ProtagonistD 'll add another layer if ProtagonistD keep bothering ProtagonistD .  < nl >  God , ProtagonistD 're annoying , no wonder ProtagonistB broke up with ProtagonistD .  < nl >  ProtagonistB broke up with ProtagonistD .  < nl >  No ProtagonistB did n't .  < nl >  Internally ProtagonistB did .  < nl > This continued for something like forty minutes , until the firemen came and rescued them ( as , of course , though < nl > ProtagonistD had indeed materialized in front of ProtagonistB to be there in ProtagonistB's time of need , ProtagonistD lacked the tools to get them out of < nl > a stopped elevator . ) < nl > It started getting suspicious , as far as ProtagonistD was concerned , the seventh time ProtagonistB was caught in the middle of a disagreement with drug addicts in the town 's worst neighborhood . That 's when ProtagonistD started suspecting foul play on ProtagonistB's part . < nl > All the same , ProtagonistD kept to ProtagonistD , standing by ProtagonistB's side as the crackheads robbed ProtagonistB ... then ProtagonistD ( because , it turns < nl > out , crackheads are not as easily spooked by people materializing out of thin air as muggers are ... these guys just < nl > said  Woah , ProtagonistE just popped into existence . Let 's rob ProtagonistE too !  ) < nl > Then it was a cliff - literally , ProtagonistB standing on the edge of a cliff , about to lose balance , and ProtagonistD popped up by ProtagonistB < nl > side to save ProtagonistB . < nl > Then it was a minor car accident . < nl > Then a fight with this bitchy girl ProtagonistB knew from high school . < nl > ProtagonistD decided to say something when ProtagonistD suddenly materialized in front of ProtagonistB inside a warehouse filled to the < nl > ceiling with towers and towers of cocaine packs and surrounded by angry , machine - gun wielding Brazilian men somewhere deep in the rainforests of South America . < nl >  Okay , that 's it ,  ProtagonistD said , as soon as ProtagonistD laid eyes on Lyla , tied to a chair in the back of the room , behind some drug stacks .  What the hell , ProtagonistB ! ?  < nl >  ProtagonistB 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB got lost hiking .  < nl > ProtagonistD got closer to ProtagonistB , untied ProtagonistB , careful not to alert the men patrolling the warehouse just behind the stack of < nl > cocaine they were pressed against .  No ProtagonistB did n't .  < nl >  Excuse ProtagonistB ! ?  < nl >  Look , ProtagonistD 'm sorry it did n't work out between us ,  ProtagonistD said , as ProtagonistB got up and rubbed ProtagonistB's wrists .  But ProtagonistB got ta < nl > stop putting ProtagonistB into dangerous situations just because ProtagonistB want to try to hurt ProtagonistD .  < nl >  What ! ?  < nl >  ProtagonistB do n't think ProtagonistD 've noticed ! ? Seven muggings ! Random fights ! Random cliffs ! And now ProtagonistB show up at a drug < nl > warehouse in South America ! ? ProtagonistB hate hiking ! Come on , ProtagonistB , it 's so obvious ! ProtagonistB 're trying to get ProtagonistD killed !  < nl >  Who 's there ! ?  came a voice from behind the cocaine stack , because Brazilians speak English when it 's convenient for the plot . < nl >  Is that what ProtagonistD think ProtagonistB 'm doing ! ?  ProtagonistB asked . < nl >  Well , is n't it ! ? Why else would ProtagonistB keep putting ProtagonistB into these dangerous situat -  < nl >  BECAUSE ProtagonistB MISS ProtagonistD , YOU IDIOT !  ProtagonistB pushed ProtagonistD .  ProtagonistB MISS ProtagonistD AND ProtagonistB DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO CALL ProtagonistD < nl > AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY ProtagonistB CAN THINK TO SEE ProtagonistD FROM TIME TO TIME .  < nl >  Hey , there 's a dude with the girl we caught over here !  One of the drug thugs showed up , pointing the gun . < nl >  ProtagonistB miss ProtagonistD ?  ProtagonistD asked , quietly . < nl >  Yes , you idiot . What , ProtagonistB think ProtagonistD take trips to the rainforest and end up on coke farms by accident ?  < nl > More men showed up , all wielding machine guns . They pointed . < nl >  Fuck , why did n't ProtagonistB just say so ?  < nl >  Cause ProtagonistB never seem happy to see ProtagonistD .  < nl >  THAT 'S BECAUSE WE'RE ALWAYS ON THE VERGE OF DEATH WHEN ProtagonistD SEE ProtagonistB , NOT BECAUSE ProtagonistD STOPPED LOVING < nl > ProtagonistB !  < nl >  ProtagonistB still love ProtagonistD ?  < nl >  OF COURSE ProtagonistB DO , ProtagonistB !  < nl >  Why are ProtagonistB yelling ?  < nl >  BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT TO DIE !  < nl > ProtagonistB looked at the men . Then at ProtagonistD .  It does look that way .  < nl >  I'M GONNA KISS ProtagonistB NOW .  < nl >  Okay .  ProtagonistB smiled . < nl > And they did kiss . And then , of course , the Brazilian drug men opened fire and they died a very bloody , horrible death , but it was kind of romantic , really . ProtagonistA thought so , at least . < nl > _ _ _ _ _ < nl > /r / psycho_alpaca < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA , exhausted from a double shift , put ProtagonistA's green blouse into the washing machine .   ProtagonistA poured ProtagonistA's Clorox Bleach in and washed the garment .   30 minutes later ProtagonistA mindlessly threw the blouse into the dryer and set it for 50 minutes .   ProtagonistA promptly fell asleep , looking forward to ProtagonistA's job interview for the next day .   When ProtagonistA awoke 9 hours later , ProtagonistA was frantic as ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was going to be late for ProtagonistA's job interview at the High Powered Business Person 's Business .   ProtagonistA grabbed the blouse , the faint light barely spilling in from ProtagonistA's cracked apartment windows and began to iron .   The shirt exploded , engulfing ProtagonistA in flames .   The flames quickly spread to the rest of ProtagonistA's apartment building .   45 innocents perished because the tag that read  Do Not Bleach , Do not Machine Dry , Do Not Iron  was not on ProtagonistA's brand new blouse . < nl > ProtagonistB had just laid down in ProtagonistB's bed , ready to enjoy ProtagonistB's brand new mattress .   ProtagonistB had gotten the mattress from Steve 's Wholesale Bedding just down the street only today .   But what ProtagonistB did n't know , because the label was removed , was that Steve 's Wholesale Bedding had gotten the mattress from a factory in Columbus , Ohio that had used other dirty recycled mattress to make this new mattress .   The bedbug attack was so fierce and unexpected that within 20 minutes only a skeleton remained of ProtagonistB . < nl > ProtagonistC looked in ProtagonistC's side view mirror and saw the T rex 's jaws gaping .   However , the view in the mirror showed the dinosaur much further behind ProtagonistC than ProtagonistC had thought .   ProtagonistC knew that they were safe , despite the screaming of ProtagonistD .   No one listened to ProtagonistD and ProtagonistD's chaos theory because ProtagonistD was an insufferable bore and know it all . ProtagonistC breathed a sigh of relief and slowed the jeep down .    It was n't until ProtagonistE was snatched from the passenger seat of the jeep that ProtagonistC realized objects in the mirror may be closer than they appear .   The T - rex soon ate them all .   Dr. Grant , upon learning of ProtagonistE's death but not caring about ProtagonistD's , became despondent and allowed himself to be eaten as well . The dinosaurs escaped the island and invaded the mainland .   No one was prepared because no one even knew that dinosaurs existed once again .    New York became a dinosaur buffet . < nl > ProtagonistF leaned ProtagonistF's back against the wall at the chemical plant .   ProtagonistF removed ProtagonistF's hard hat and began to think of Linda waiting for ProtagonistF back home .   ProtagonistF was lost in ProtagonistF's thoughts when ProtagonistF brought ProtagonistF's lighter to ProtagonistF's mouth , getting ready to inhale that first cigarette after a long shift .   ProtagonistF did , then the plant exploded , releasing benzene over half of Dallas County .   Half a million people either died or suffered permanent damage due to the chemical cloud .   The act was incorrectly labeled a terrorist attack perpetrated by North Korea and international tensions rose . < nl > ProtagonistG , finished welding the surplus jet engine onto the top of ProtagonistG's used Volkswagen Beetle .   ProtagonistG downed ProtagonistG's beer , a Natural Light that a Texan sent ProtagonistG , and got into ProtagonistG's car .   When ProtagonistG was ready , ProtagonistG smiled at the small gathering of friends around ProtagonistG and uttered the last words anyone would ever hear ProtagonistG say :    Let 's light this candle !    ProtagonistG's friends were standing too close behind the jet engine and quickly caught fire .   The little car took off and soon found itself airborne without any way to control it .   North Korea , mistaking the car for a missile attack , fired its own missiles .   However , the guidance systems were so bad , probably made at a mattress company in Columbus , Ohio , that they quickly veered off course .   ProtagonistG was right , they had been able to make missiles that could reach any continent in the world .   45 nuclear missiles landed in Antarctica and the polar ice cap was obliterated .   Within a year there was no more land for people to live on .   In the beginning , billions had died holding onto children 's inflatable beach balls not realizing that they were not flotation devices . < nl > A new society would eventually arise , leading watery nomadic lives .   They would have many years of trials and tribulations until a brave man by the name of Kevin Costner grew gills and saved the last of humanity by leading them to the only land left on the planet . < nl > Author 's Edit :   Just wanted to drop in and say a quick thank you to all the people who have read this story .   The comments have been making me laugh all morning .   I love the debate about when to wash new clothes . < eos > 
< sos >  Same rules as every year ,  droned ProtagonistA .  You will be monitored at all times . You will be in no danger . You must simply spot the historical inaccuracy . Correcting it yourself will earn you bonus points , but is not a requirement . Simply give your answers to your spotter and they will set things right before closing the time loop and ending your exam . Any questions ?  < nl >  Yes ,  said ProtagonistB , gripping the edges of ProtagonistB's desk .  Which ... exactly * which * period will we be ... y'know ... where're we going ?  < nl >  This is ProtagonistB's final exam ,  said ProtagonistA coldly .  Any period that has been discussed in this class is a possibility .  < nl >  Oh ,  said ProtagonistB .  We ... we covered a lot this year , did n't we ?  < nl > ProtagonistA smiled .  Nearly everything .  < nl > ProtagonistB gulped . There was a Knowledge Pad balanced on ProtagonistB's lap , hidden behind ProtagonistB's desk . As ProtagonistA called students to the Time Swing , ProtagonistB swiped furiously through random articles , videos , and fact sheets . < nl >  Ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ,  ProtagonistB mumbled .  ProtagonistB do n't know who ProtagonistC is . ProtagonistB do n't even know if ProtagonistC 's a real person . Genghis Khan ! What the * hell * is a Genghis Khan ? Ohcrap ohcrap ohcrap .  < nl >  ProtagonistB ?  said ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB's turn .  < nl > ProtagonistB dripped out of ProtagonistB's chair , slowly shuffling ProtagonistB's way to the front of the room . The Time Swing was a chair in a sort of gyroscope . It did n't look like much . It did n't even make much of a sound when it was activated . But it worked and worked well . ProtagonistB sat down and let Barney the Teacher 's Aide secure the restraining bar . < nl >  Good luck ,  said ProtagonistA .  And remember , you do n't need to * fix * anything . In fact , unless you 're absolutely confident about the situation , you 're really better off letting your spotter handle it . Understood ?  < nl > ProtagonistB could n't tell if ProtagonistA was being kind or cruel in that moment . It certainly felt like a bit of both . < nl > Before ProtagonistB could respond , however , the chair began to turn over , slowly at first , and then faster , and then so fast ProtagonistB was n't in the chair at all anymore . Or in the classroom . Or in the same century , for that matter . < nl > When ProtagonistB opened ProtagonistB's eyes ProtagonistB was on the floor in a small , poorly lit room . < nl >  Come on ,  said a voice in the darkness .  Time to get dressed .  < nl > The voice belonged to ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD handed ProtagonistB heavy wool slacks and a large overcoat . < nl >  Here 's a hat , too ,  said ProtagonistD , handing ProtagonistB a rumpled cap .  Wear it low over ProtagonistB's face . ProtagonistB want to be inconspicuous . ProtagonistB do n't look quite like the locals .  < nl >  Where are we ?  asked ProtagonistB . < nl >  You know ProtagonistD ca n't say that ,  said ProtagonistD .  Hurry up . ProtagonistD 'll take ProtagonistB to the location .  < nl > ProtagonistB threw on the clothes and followed ProtagonistD out the door and into the street . It was a warm , breezy day . Men and women pushed past , paying ProtagonistB no attention . They were dressed similar to ProtagonistB , though most wore thinner coats or long , formal dresses . It felt like summertime , after all . A trolley rolled by . ProtagonistB had absolutely no idea where they were . < nl >  Come on ,  whispered ProtagonistD , pulling ProtagonistB along up to an intersection . ProtagonistB bumped into a man who said something in a language that was not English . That narrowed things down at least a little . < nl >  Here ,  said ProtagonistD , pushing ProtagonistB up to the edge of the curb .  ProtagonistB's exam begins now .  < nl > ProtagonistB was bewildered . It was the past , obviously , but how far back , ProtagonistB could n't say . And * where * , ProtagonistB was equally lost . Moreover , there was nothing to see . Just people streaming past , some queuing up around ProtagonistB and on the other side of the street . < nl > * A parade , maybe * , thought ProtagonistB . But how many historically significant * parades * could ProtagonistB name ? < nl > The people there on the street became excited . Some yelling . Some cheering . Some , a few , jeering . Still , ProtagonistB could n't see the cause of their excitement . Imposing men bustled past . Police , maybe ? Or soldiers ? They looked very official and all of them were armed . < nl > Finally , ProtagonistB saw it . A car . A very old sort of car . The type with no roof and those big , narrow bicycle - looking tires . A man and ProtagonistE sat in the back of the car as it moved slowly down the street . ProtagonistB could tell they were important . Royalty , maybe ? The President of wherever they were ? The man wore a red and white sash and a strange many - tiered hat . ProtagonistE was dressed in white . ProtagonistE's enormous , wide - brimmed hat was covered in real flowers . < nl > There was a scuffle in the street . ProtagonistF had run out towards the car . ProtagonistF held out a gun and took aim at the man in the car . ProtagonistF pulled the trigger - once , twice , three times . But the gun did nothing . The man was surrounded by police . The car tried to get away , though it was stymied by the swarming , hysterical crowd . < nl >  ProtagonistB's answer ?  said ProtagonistD . ProtagonistB had momentarily forgotten all about ProtagonistD . < nl >  ProtagonistB ...  There was nothing . ProtagonistB had nothing .  ProtagonistB do n't know ,  said ProtagonistB softly .  ProtagonistB do n't know what that was .  < nl >  Not even a guess ?  said ProtagonistD .  This counts for 30 percent of ProtagonistB's grade .  < nl >  Some ... king .  ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head .  ProtagonistB do n't know .  < nl >  That 's ProtagonistG ,  said ProtagonistD , pointing at the man in the car .  Archduke of Austria . ProtagonistG 's to be assassinated today . It 's a major catalyst to the beginning of World War I.  ProtagonistD patted ProtagonistB on the back .  Do n't stress out about it . It 's just a history class . It 's not the end of the ...  < nl > ProtagonistB saw the gun flash what seemed like hours before ProtagonistB heard the bang . ProtagonistB had not been watching the gunman and the police or even the Archduke and ProtagonistE . Instead ProtagonistB's eyes had been on ProtagonistH . Maybe ProtagonistH had been with the gunman . Maybe not . All the same , ProtagonistH drew ProtagonistH's own gun and aimed it at the police . And one of the police saw this and acted just that little bit quicker , drawing and firing without hesitation . < nl > Had they been slower , though , or more cautious ; had they taken the time to draw a better sight , or consider the wisdom in firing at all , surely things would have been much different . < nl > Because they missed . Badly . < nl > ProtagonistB's spotter was dead before ProtagonistB hit in the ground . < nl > The crowd - already terrified - began to push and scream and run in every direction . Already ProtagonistB's body was swallowed up in the stampede . < nl > What did that mean ? ProtagonistB was dumbstruck . What did it mean that ProtagonistB's spotter was dead ? How did ProtagonistB get back ? How did this get * fixed * ? < nl > Did this mean there would be no World War I ? < nl > ProtagonistB hated history . ProtagonistB hated it more than math and science and every single other subject combined . What was the point of knowing what had already happened ? It never changed anything . No one ever acted differently because we knew what happened before . < nl > And no one ever told you if the things that happened - the complicated , horrible things - were good or bad . If they were necessary . < nl > So what good was history if it never helped anyone ? < nl > All ProtagonistB knew was how things * were * . What ProtagonistB's grandparents had gone through to start a new life in the United States . What ProtagonistB's parents had sacrificed so ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's three brothers could have joyful , fulfilling lives . It seemed disrespectful to even consider a world where those things did n't happen , and all because ProtagonistB was too lazy to study for ProtagonistB's history exam . < nl > One of the policeman collapsed at ProtagonistB's feet . ProtagonistB reached down and pulled the pistol out of his hand . < nl > The car had n't gone very far . < nl > ProtagonistB could catch it if ProtagonistB ran . < eos > 
< sos > Tensions are high as ProtagonistA confronts ProtagonistB , this species is known for unusual and often varied courting methods - ProtagonistA has done away with the more common methods of wooing ProtagonistB with erratic movements and hip thrusts . Instead ProtagonistA opts for a more simple approach , ProtagonistA aims to give ProtagonistB a gift . < nl > It should be noted that within this species females often travel in packs . This pack mentality serves as a natural deterrent against males who do n't have the drive to show their face to a whole group when courting a single female - a form of natural selection if you would . The pack waits behind ProtagonistB , ' oohing ' and ' ahing ' , mechanisms used to separate the truly decisive males from the others . It is often observed that males who make it this point succeed in their efforts . < nl > ProtagonistA now slowly approaches ProtagonistB , gift in hand - a rose , roses are commonplace as courtship gifts within this particular sub - species known as ' high - schoolers ' . After a brief moment ProtagonistB takes the rose , ProtagonistA 's done it . A snicker ensues from ProtagonistB's pack , ProtagonistA embraces ProtagonistB and pats ProtagonistB on the back - ProtagonistB , visually deterred by this , smiles and returns to ProtagonistB's pack . < nl > A sound much like a bell rings signalling all present members of the species to return to their dens for more group tutoring . < nl > ( This is my first prompt reply - I tried ! ) < eos > 
< sos >  It 's just not the same ,  ProtagonistA continued , from where ProtagonistA was sitting in an armchair .  Everyone is so distracted by their phones and their electronics and their doohickeys . Now , back in ProtagonistA's day-  < nl >  ProtagonistB !  yelled out a voice from the hallway . < nl > ProtagonistB , let out an exasperated huff . A hero ? On a Wednesday afternoon ? < nl > ProtagonistB snapped ProtagonistB's fingers . < nl >  ProtagonistB 'm here to- * urp ! *  < nl > ProtagonistA paused in ProtagonistA's story .  Did ProtagonistB say something , ProtagonistB ?  < nl > ProtagonistB gave ProtagonistA an apologetic smile .  It was n't ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB think it 's from outside . ProtagonistB 'll just pop out to see what it is , wo n't be a moment .  < nl > ProtagonistB stepped out of the study and shut the door behind ProtagonistB gently before leaning back on it , taking a deep breath . ProtagonistB could feel the familiar weight of ProtagonistB's mask clipped to ProtagonistB's belt . It was designed to cover ProtagonistB's whole face with dark , jagged crystals , all harsh lines and sharp edges , black ice as twisted and as dangerous as ProtagonistB was supposed to be . ProtagonistB put it on . < nl > ProtagonistB briskly made ProtagonistB's way to the hero ProtagonistB 'd flash frozen in a cube of ice in ProtagonistB's hallway . ProtagonistB could n't   quite make out the mask underneath the murky surface , but the costume was gaudy , the colors garish . ProtagonistB could n't help but sigh . An amateur , but that was only to be expected - the veterans in the United League of Heroes knew better than to disturb ProtagonistB on Wednesdays . < nl > ProtagonistB snapped ProtagonistB's fingers . < nl > The cube melted in an instant , freezing water gushing across the floor , draining quietly through the numerous storm drains ProtagonistB 'd had installed . < nl > The hero inside it coughed , a series of violent , hacking sounds , and ProtagonistB felt ProtagonistB's lips curl into a sneer . ProtagonistB 'd only frozen the hero for a minute at best . Newbies nowadays ... < nl >  ProtagonistB !  the hero called - well , wheezed .  I 'm here to-  < nl >  Your name ?  ProtagonistB said . < nl >  Stop you- huh ?  the hero faltered . This close , their voice was young , high pitched , still slightly squeaky .  My ... what ?  < nl >  Your . Name .  ProtagonistB said , enunciating the words clearly . ProtagonistB gestured at the hero 's bedraggled costume . < nl > The hero blinked up at ProtagonistB .  I'm- I 'm Phoenix .  < nl > ProtagonistB rolled ProtagonistB's eyes . Seriously ?  Let ProtagonistB guess . You had some sort of traumatic incident in your life most likely due to a supervillain , a superhero saved you , and since then your lifelong dream was to become a superhero just like them ?  < nl > Phoenix stared at ProtagonistB , mouth slightly open , as though halfway through objecting but not sure to what . < nl > ProtagonistB waited a moment . It was only polite . < nl > When no response was forthcoming , ProtagonistB continued .  Let 's see if ProtagonistB 'm on a lucky streak . Lo and behold , you 're one of the lucky few that get usable powers , you realize you have a knack for fire , and you have the brilliant idea to come here to try to get rid of ProtagonistB once and for all because ProtagonistB 'm the President of the Confederation and hence must be the worst villain around , and fire , after all , completely negates ice ? Or so you 'd think , at least ?  < nl >  Uh .  said Phoenix . < nl >  Did you listen at all during class ? They teach you this on the first week .  < nl > The blush was a dead giveaway . < nl > ProtagonistB sighed .  Oh , dear . You went off to find ProtagonistB the moment you got your powers , did n't you ? Did you have the costume ready made ?  < nl > It was disappointing . The quality of fledgling heroes kept dropping with every passing year . There were just too many heroes convinced they were experts on fighting crime after reading a how - to guide on the internet . < nl >  So , Phoenix ,  ProtagonistB continued .  Usually , as retribution , ProtagonistB 'd freeze you in a block of ice and keep you that way until the League realized you 're missing , but ProtagonistB's afternoon is already fully booked . ProtagonistB need to deal with ProtagonistA's latest attempt to foil ProtagonistB's plans . Do feel free to come back around tomorrow if you fancy being frozen again .  < nl >  ProtagonistA ? !  Phoenix exclaimed , suddenly talkative once more .  ProtagonistA 's like ... old , and washed up , and senile ! ProtagonistA 's not even part of the League anymore !  < nl > ProtagonistB had to restrain ProtagonistB from freezing Phoenix - oh , but how ProtagonistB hated that name - right then and there .  ProtagonistA 's also been fighting crime for more than fifty years ,  ProtagonistB said coldly ,  Which you would know if you actually went to class . And when the League decided ProtagonistA was n't useful to them anymore , they discharged ProtagonistA without so much as a pension or even a thank you . Fifty years and it meant nothing to them . The League is n't government funded . It runs for profit , and at the end of the day , it cares about money . The League did n't much fancy taking care of an elderly , senile hero ... so it let ProtagonistA go .  < nl > Phoenix gaped at ProtagonistB . It only lasted for a moment .  The League would never do something like that !  < nl >  Ask the League where ProtagonistA's pension is ,  ProtagonistB said .  Or Wonderlady 's , or Crowstorm 's , or any of the older heroes for that matter . The League does n't care . But we at the Confederation remember , and we at the Confederation care - we have a caretaker rotation . The enemy of my enemy and all that , as they say , because the League most certainly has n't been friendly in its dealings with its older heroes . One might even say it 's been quite villainous .  < nl >  ProtagonistB 're lying !  Phoenix cried out .  The League would n't do that , and ProtagonistB 're just saying it because ProtagonistB 're , ProtagonistB 're a villain ! And evil !  < nl > ProtagonistB had lost what little patience ProtagonistB had left for that conversation .  If that helps you sleep at night , then by all means keep telling yourself that . Just remember to ask yourself why none of the League veterans ever come to challenge ProtagonistB on a Wednesday . Now get out of ProtagonistB's lair before ProtagonistB decide ProtagonistB do actually have enough time to freeze you .  < nl > A wave of ProtagonistB's hand sent a barricade of ice slamming up from the floor , a wall of jagged frost that blocked Phoenix from ProtagonistB's sight . < nl > ProtagonistB stepped back into the study a few minutes later .  Sorry , ProtagonistA . That took a little longer than ProtagonistB expected ...  ProtagonistB trailed off , finding ProtagonistA asleep in ProtagonistA's armchair . < nl >  Huh ?  ProtagonistA grunted , rousing ProtagonistA .  Whassat ?  < nl >  Nothing ,  ProtagonistB said .  Sorry for waking ProtagonistA .  < nl >  You younglings nowadays , and your nothing .  ProtagonistA grumbled .  It 's always nothing with you . Back in ProtagonistA's day , we did n't sit around doing nothing , we found ourselves something to do .  < nl > ProtagonistB smiled , turning away to hide it .  ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA did ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA did .  < nl >  You kids nowadays have it so easy , sitting around all day . Back then , being a hero meant work ! We had pride , a real pride in what we did , and ...  < eos > 
< sos >  ProtagonistA !  The police chief reveled .  Thank god ProtagonistA 're here .  < nl > ProtagonistA landed and faced the chief .  What seems to be the problem Chief ?  < nl >  All we know is there is ProtagonistB in there with a bomb strapped to ProtagonistB . We do n't know where the detonator is or how it works , but we know it 's the work of-  < nl >  ProtagonistC .  < nl >  Yeah . ProtagonistC 's up to ProtagonistC's old tricks .  < nl >  Do n't worry Chief . ProtagonistA know ProtagonistC's games . Just tell your men to stand down .  < nl > The Chief signaled to his men as ProtagonistA lept into the air and flew onto the roof of the building . ProtagonistA kneeled and pressed ProtagonistA's hands down and melted a hole in the roof just big enough to slip through . < nl > ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA hanging from the rafters of an abandoned warehouse . A few lights dimly revealed the place , nearly empty , save for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA recognized ProtagonistB right away . ProtagonistB was Trenton . That jerk in ProtagonistA's English class , always bragging about ProtagonistB's escapades with the other girls at Franklin High . < nl > ProtagonistA held back a laugh as ProtagonistA noticed the tiara sitting on ProtagonistB's head . < nl >  Quite a nice touch ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistA whispered to ProtagonistA .  Okay . Down to business .  With ProtagonistA's thermal vision ProtagonistA gauged the device .  Hmm . It just ticks ,  ProtagonistA chuckled ,  it 's a fake .  < nl > ProtagonistA flew down and lighted next to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head in a panic , directing ProtagonistA to the bomb with ProtagonistB's eyes . < nl > ProtagonistA sighed and with a wave of ProtagonistA's hand , melted the gears in the device . The ticking stopped . ProtagonistA removed the duct tape from ProtagonistB's mouth , quick and painfully , somewhat glad to get some form of payback . < nl >  Yoww ! ProtagonistA ! Thank ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA saved ProtagonistB's life .  < nl >  Do n't mention it . Please .  < nl >  ProtagonistA have to tell ProtagonistB a message , or else ProtagonistB 'll still set off the bomb .  < nl > ProtagonistA snorted ,  right .  < nl >  ProtagonistB said , meet ProtagonistA where ProtagonistB , plays- ProtagonistB made ProtagonistA say that . ProtagonistA had to say that- and sparks will really fly . But you ca n't be low to see it , you have to be Franklin * High * .  ProtagonistB rolled ProtagonistB's eyes .  That freakin ' nerd . What kind of name is ProtagonistD ? ProtagonistD's is a fuckin ' sandwich place .  < nl > ProtagonistA smiled .  ProtagonistA think ProtagonistD 's cute ,  ProtagonistA said and lept up into the air . < nl >  Wait ! Get ProtagonistA out of here !  < nl >  Bye , ProtagonistB .  < nl > ProtagonistA flew quickly and excitedly to the Franklin High football field , where blazing letters across it spelled out P - R - O - M- ? < nl > ProtagonistA spotted ProtagonistB on a building overlooking ProtagonistB's work and landed across from ProtagonistB . < nl >  Barry ? From chem class ? ProtagonistA 're the infamous Quizno ?  < nl >  Uhm , h - hi .  < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA protested at first , insisting that the blindfold would give ProtagonistA's motion sickness . ProtagonistA eventually relented when ProtagonistA realised they prized secrecy over the cleanliness of their car . < nl > Men and their cloaks and daggers , ProtagonistA thought , desperately trying to hold ProtagonistA's dinner down as the car cruised over the bumpy country road . < nl > ProtagonistA soon found ProtagonistA deposited at a clearing in the forest , where ProtagonistB was already waiting for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA did n't hesitate to share a piece of ProtagonistA's mind .  Was all this really necessary ? ProtagonistB know that ProtagonistA work best in ProtagonistA's lab , right ? ProtagonistA do n't have half the equipment ProtagonistA need here , and this is going to be such a waste of time .  < nl >  It 's urgent ,  ProtagonistB said , starting to grin ,  besides , do n't archaeologists love field trips ?  < nl > ProtagonistA had more than enough fuel to continue complaining for at least an hour , but then ProtagonistA caught sight of the other Agents fanned out in a rough perimeter around the clearing . Dusk had already begun to rob the skies of their primary source of illumination , and as the towering spotlights flickered on one by one , ProtagonistA was left with little doubt that this was anything but an ordinary expedition . < nl > The glazed - wood crossbows , strapped to the backs of the Agents , was the only confirmation ProtagonistA needed . There was enough firepower there to level a small city , give or take . < nl >  Are those ... 19th century Barnett crossbows ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA see why we need ProtagonistA here ? There 's no one else better at what ProtagonistA do , and ProtagonistA know that .  < nl >  Are we in danger ?  said ProtagonistA , looking about ProtagonistA frantically .  In all ProtagonistA's years working with you , ProtagonistA 've never seen such a show of force !  < nl > ProtagonistB laughed .  Just a precaution . ProtagonistA 'll understand when ProtagonistA see . Come .  < nl > At the center of the clearing , two Agents were waiting with what appeared to be ProtagonistC . The weary look on ProtagonistC's face suggested that ProtagonistC had been inconvenienced for quite some time already . < nl >  Are ProtagonistA the scientist they said was coming to evaluate the site ? Oh , we 've been waiting too long ! Am I done here ? Can I go now ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm not a scientist ,  ProtagonistA grumbled ,  but ProtagonistA suppose ProtagonistA was the one you 're waiting for . What did you find ?  < nl > ProtagonistA still remembered the first time ProtagonistA had been engaged to assist . Whisked out of ProtagonistA's laboratory under similar circumstances , ProtagonistA was asked to opine whether the cache of weapons intercepted by customs were merely very recently - produced replicas of hundred - year old slingshots , meant for a movie production as the labels on the shipping boxes indicated , or whether they were evidence of an arms - smuggling route , long suspected but never confirmed . < nl > That was ProtagonistA's forte , the ability to marry keenness of observation with intellect of mind , to ascertain and evaluate the strength of any weapon ProtagonistA came across . Sure , anyone could simply wield said weapon to find out how potent they were , but that always carried a risk . After all , it was n't always easy to tell the difference between a fifty - year old knife and a five - hundred - year old one , and with the way that weapons grew exponentially more powerful as the years rolled by ... the world had certainly seen more than enough of its fair share of accidental devastations , just because someone thought to see what that old rusty spear they had found could do . < nl > Hence , the demand for people of ProtagonistA's calibre , archaeologists who specialized in weapon - dating . < nl >  ProtagonistD was looking for new land to expand ProtagonistD's farm to , so ProtagonistD came here to dig around , test the soil . That 's when ProtagonistD found this ,  said ProtagonistD , pointing to a patch of earth ProtagonistD had evidently spent some effort digging through . < nl > ProtagonistB spoke into ProtagonistB's walkie - talkie , and the nearest spotlight swivelled to bathe them in harsh , cold light . ProtagonistA squinted , shielding ProtagonistA's eyes from the sudden assault , trying to discern what lay beneath . < nl >  This ... is not a weapon ,  ProtagonistA said ,  it 's a skeleton . The undeveloped curvature of the hips , the length of the shin bones ... this looks like a male , I would say . It 's old , that 's for sure , but I 'd need to run tests to figure out just how old . To be honest , and I do n't want to rain on ProtagonistA's parade , but you 're not going to get much mileage out of this one . You could fashion his bones into a spear , or a club , but because they were never used as weapons before , in the literal sense , it does n't matter how much time has passed . You 're never going to get anything useful out of th-  < nl >  Please , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA give us too little credit . We know weapons only start accruing potency from the time they were wielded as one . For now , what 's ProtagonistA's best guess , how powerful would these bones be , if they were weapons ?  < nl > ProtagonistA thought back to the Atgeir Scale , named after the oldest , intact weapon humanity had ever unearthed , a Viking dagger from the 10th century . It occupied the top - end of the scale , with a full score of 10.0 Atgeir points , the perfect combination of age and intent - the Bartnett crossbows ProtagonistA saw earlier easily rated 2.0 , 2.2 Atgeir points each . That Viking relic had such destructive power that the United Nations had lobbied for it to be smelted and dispersed , such was the threat to the stability of the planet . Every other weapon since then had been measured against it , and found wanting . < nl >  Well ... again , ProtagonistA ca n't be sure , but these bones look to be at least ... what , 50,000 , 55,000 years old ? So yes , of course , if they were weapons they would completely rewrite the Atgeir Scale , and make our entire country 's arsenal look like hot sand in comparison . But as ProtagonistA 've said , these bones are n't weapons .  < nl > ProtagonistB smiled .  ProtagonistA 're not on ProtagonistA's best form today , ProtagonistA . Observe the skull ,  ProtagonistB said , lifting the skeleton lightly with gloved hands . < nl > ProtagonistA saw it then , the smooth grain of the bone ending in raw , jagged edges at the back of the skull . Though age had worn away some of the enamel , introduced cracks and chips where there were none before , this was a classic case of someone who had been quite violently , for the lack of a better word , brained from the back with a blunt instrument . < nl > The gears clicked in ProtagonistA's mind . < nl >  Do ProtagonistB mean ...  < nl > ProtagonistB nodded , then pointed a short distance away , where preliminary digging had uncovered a slab of carbonite , dark as midnight , pulsing with a quiet , pensive energy . It was about the size of a large basketball , and wielded between two hands , swung overhead at a target , it would have carried quite the perfect heft . < nl >  That 's the murder weapon right there , for a crime over 50,000 years old . Care to reevaluate just how much this trip is waste of your time ?  < nl > --- < nl > /r / rarelyfunny < eos > 
< sos >  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said , as ProtagonistA's spade bit into the earth . Tears crept down skin that had , until this day , been desert . < nl >  Why are ProtagonistA doing this ?  ProtagonistB asked , ProtagonistB's wrists struggling against the rope bindings ; they did n't hurt ProtagonistB , no matter how fiercely ProtagonistB fought them , and yet they were tight . < nl > ProtagonistA heaved another mound of dirt out of the slowly deepening hole . In the distance , a great vulture flew down from a tree and landed next to the body of ProtagonistB's brother . Its beak dipped into the open carcass . < nl >  ProtagonistA could n't kill ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA ca n't even harm ProtagonistB .  < nl >  Then ... we are ...  < nl > ProtagonistA paused for a moment .  I-  ProtagonistA stuttered ,  ProtagonistA ca n't kill ProtagonistB , but others can . * They will * . ProtagonistB are the King 's daughter . ProtagonistB will be cut into pieces . And ProtagonistA will be killed for helping ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA thrust the spade back into the earth . < nl > The vulture squawked ; its beak was now a dripping crimson . < nl >  ProtagonistA do n't have to do this . We could run away , together ,  ProtagonistB begged . < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm sorry . But ProtagonistA will come back for ProtagonistB .  Sweat mingled with tears , and the evening light danced on ProtagonistA's cheeks . ProtagonistA picked ProtagonistB up , and carefully placed ProtagonistB into the pit . < nl >  Please ,  ProtagonistB begged , terrified , as dirt fell onto ProtagonistB . < nl > For a moment ProtagonistA paused . The spade trembled violently in ProtagonistA's hands . ProtagonistA looked down into ProtagonistB's eyes : they were a damp , viridescent - like morning dew on a rose leaf . After a deep breath , ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head . < nl >  Plea ..  ProtagonistB's voice was muffled and faint , and soon ProtagonistA heard nothing . < nl >  ProtagonistA 'll come back for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA promise .  < nl > --- < nl > Darkness . < nl > Moons passed . Years fell like raindrops and the black net seemed to last forever . It was a farmer , turning earth for ProtagonistA's crops , that found the body . When it began to slowly move , writhing in its pit , ProtagonistA dropped ProtagonistA's spade and fled . < nl > ProtagonistB crawled out of the grave , shielding ProtagonistB's face from the blazing sunlight . ProtagonistB's once green eyes were now that of the darkness ProtagonistB 'd been prisoner to . < nl > ProtagonistB 'd never felt so thirsty - a dreadful , desperate burn that had been building for so long yearned within ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB's torn , rotten , clothes flapped in the wind . ProtagonistB had waited for ProtagonistA - ProtagonistB 'd had no choice . ProtagonistB's body had not suffered in the grave , but ProtagonistB's mind had been terribly changed . < nl >  ProtagonistB will find ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB whispered . The breeze took ProtagonistB's words and spread them like seeds across the kingdom . < nl > Far away from the excavated pit , a shiver ran down ProtagonistA's spine . < nl > --- < nl > [ Part 2](https://www.reddit.com / r / nickofnight / comments/66w65a / wp_you_live_in_a_world_where_your_soulmate_is/ ) < eos > 
< sos > It was n't the crowd , or the shouting , or the fire , but ProtagonistA's body that shocked ProtagonistA the most .   ProtagonistA felt frail and ached all over . ProtagonistA looked down to see ProtagonistA's hands .   They were cracked like aged leather .   ProtagonistA's skin papery and thin . < nl >  Where am ProtagonistA ?   What 's happening ?    ProtagonistA asked the crowd . < nl > ProtagonistB turned to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB must have been at least 50 . < nl >  ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said , placing a hand on ProtagonistA's shoulder ,  c'est la revolution !  < nl > ProtagonistA never learned french , but had understood ProtagonistB .   ProtagonistA   Suddenly the memories hit ProtagonistA .   ProtagonistA had grown up in Paris , the daughter of a cobbler .   ProtagonistA's calloused hands reflected the work ProtagonistA devoted ProtagonistA to for years .   ProtagonistA married ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC had passed instantly in ' 76 when news from the America 's came to France . < nl > Pushed and shoved by the crowd , ProtagonistA began thinking of a simpler time .   ProtagonistA's childhood had been quiet , not loud and rebellious .   ProtagonistA thought back on ProtagonistA's youth .   ProtagonistA thought of the French countryside , the devotion to the King , and the simpler attitude of the 17th century .   ProtagonistA was always forgetting ProtagonistA's past .   Surely ProtagonistD would berate ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's forgetfulness . < nl > ProtagonistD was carrying ProtagonistA out of the crowd . ProtagonistA had fallen when a young man had pushed passes ProtagonistA to get to the front of the crowd .   It was the fourth anniversary of the fall of the Bastille and Paris was on fire . < nl >  Le 14 juillet .  ProtagonistA thought fondly .  Je suis nee le 14 juillet 1693 .    ProtagonistA truly was born in the ' 90 's . A time where revolution was not spoken of .   A time before the Washington 's and the Robespierre 's .   A time when your biggest concern was marrying the tailor or the fishmonger .   A time of enlightenment , thought , and peace .   But oh ,   those years have passed . < nl > ProtagonistA began to feel that familiar haze .   ProtagonistA new ProtagonistA's moment of lucidity would disappear soon .   ProtagonistA smiled , clutching ProtagonistD's arm as ProtagonistD rushed ProtagonistA out of the city square . < nl > The memory of ProtagonistA's wish from all those years to come had faded away . < eos >

They came from a sinkhole in the ocean that our scientists determined to be a mechanism much like a wormhole . Then came the ones that wanted our Earth . They crashed into our planet on a thousand meteorite - like vehicles made of a substance unknown to our universe . And at last , the ones who wanted our air and the ones who wanted our water . They came together from portals that eviscerated our poles . One for the south pole , the other for the north . Each had accomplished feats that had left our scientists baffled . And what was even more troubling -- they all resembled humans . < nl > We had tried greeting the ones who wanted our fire . We had sent them presents , precious metals , and the welcoming smile of our most expert convoys . They retaliated with a tsunami that wiped out Japan . It was magic , real magic . Something we had previously thought only existed in Hollywood and cartoons . With a few incantations , they could manipulate the water , the earth , even the air that we breathed . But they could not touch fire . So we gave them what they wanted . Napalm , incendiary bombs , hellfire missiles . They wanted our fire so bad ? I hoped they like our gifts . < nl > Things were desperate but humanity was always at its best when pushed to the edge . Then came the Earth - Takers . At first , we had thought they were here to aid us in the invasion . They seemed enemies to the Fire - Takers and as the old saying goes--*the enemy of my enemy ... * But though they were quick to attack each other , they were even quicker to attack us . These new aliens , they wanted our earth . So we gave it to those bastards with steel - tipped bullets , titanium - plated tanks , and a kinetic bombardment of tungsten launched from our satellites . < nl > By the times the portals opened in the north and south poles , we already knew what to do . < nl > These aliens looked like us but that was where the similarities ended . Everything they had ever wanted they had accomplished through magic . What would 've taken humans years to do , they could simply chant and incantation to do so . < nl > Thank God we never fell into the folly of magic . They have no idea what it means to move mountains by hand , to   conquer the skies armed only with dirt and stone , to create the greatest weapons in our known universe because we were pushed that far into the corner . Aliens this weak would never snuff out humanity . < nl > That I promise you . < nl > --- < nl > ProtagonistA's pen stopped at the period . The walls around ProtagonistA shook . Bits of dirt crumbled from the ceiling onto ProtagonistA's desk . The lights swayed , dancing the shadows around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had spent all night on this letter . It was the last one ProtagonistA would ever write and the first aimed at humanity 's next generation , the generation of soldiers who had never experienced an alien free Earth . < nl >  ProtagonistA ,  came a voice from behind . < nl > ProtagonistA turned to see ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB's feet together , shoulders stiff , and arms held to ProtagonistB's head in salute . They had started the Resistance together when the governments crumbled and countries fell . At first , it had simply been a way to quell their anger as the other aliens fought for lands rightfully theirs . < nl > Blow a hole in a supply chain . Sabotage key communications . Small - scale things . But just as the aliens had done , ProtagonistA had underestimated humanity 's grit . A million calls , e - mails , texts flooded ProtagonistA's servers and as ProtagonistA strung them all together , the Resistance was born . < nl >  At ease , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said . < nl > ProtagonistB lowered ProtagonistB's arm .  ProtagonistC , the Earth - Takers are approaching from the North in war balloons . Initial scouts report a tornado of fire dragged behind them .  < nl > ProtagonistA smiled at ProtagonistC .  * At ease * ,  ProtagonistA said .  Commander Gladstead ? ProtagonistC sound like a grunt .  ProtagonistA had always hated that title -- commander . In a previous life , ProtagonistA was a pre - school teacher and now , men of the highest positions of power all reported to ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistC's shoulder dropped .  As ProtagonistA command , ProtagonistA .  But this ProtagonistC said with a crescent grin . ProtagonistC knew how power annoyed ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistA ignored ProtagonistC's smile .  How are we holding up against the Fire - Takers ?  < nl >  Still at a stale - mate , but not for long . We 're almost out of missiles and our soldiers on the ground are being swallowed by the Earth itself .  < nl > ProtagonistA nodded . Not good news , but good enough .  And at our East and West ?  < nl >  The others are approaching . Their scouts are already here with their armies soon to follow .  < nl > ProtagonistA chuckled . Victory was always so bittersweet .  ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said ,  get out of here . Tell everyone not in combat to do the same .  < nl > ProtagonistB did n't move . ProtagonistB pressed ProtagonistB's lips together and stared at ProtagonistA .  Come with ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said , pleaded . < nl >  We do n't fool magic ,  ProtagonistA said , a grin parting between ProtagonistA's lips .  They all came knowing full well that this is a trap and that 's because the bait is just too good to pass off . Look at that , ProtagonistA . Not bad , eh ?  < nl > ProtagonistB coughed out a chuckle . ProtagonistB took a small breath and gritted ProtagonistB's teeth .  ProtagonistA , it 's been an honor .  < nl >  Do n't worry , ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA 'll show them just how high the price is for ProtagonistA .  < nl >  Yes ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB straightened up , every one of ProtagonistB's muscles stiff . ProtagonistB jabbed ProtagonistB's forehead with ProtagonistB's hand and returned ProtagonistA the sharpest salute ProtagonistA had ever seen . Without another word , ProtagonistB left . < nl >  Give 'em hell , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA whispered to the back of ProtagonistB's head . ProtagonistA watched even as ProtagonistB turned the corner and disappeared into the underground corridors of their bunker . < nl > Drops of water followed ProtagonistB out . < nl > The ground shook again . Another aftershock , another earthquake . ProtagonistA stared at ProtagonistA's letter . ProtagonistA nodded and put pen to paper . < nl > --- < nl > We are about to unleash the deadliest weapon humanity has ever conceived . We call it the hydrogen bomb . It is the combination of every single one of our elemental powers . The blast will consume their armies and leave their bases defenseless and when that happens , ProtagonistA have a single selfish request . Take everything from them . Go through their portals , their sinkholes , their spaceships and show them the true horrors of the war they have bestowed upon us . < nl > Long live humanity , the warriors without magic ! < nl > ProtagonistA Commander of the Resistance . < nl > --- < nl > --- < nl > /r / jraywang . 2 new WP stories daily .

< sos >  Calm down ,  ProtagonistB said , gesturing ProtagonistA to stop hopping around the room . < nl >  I- ProtagonistA did n't think it would actually * work ! *  exclaimed ProtagonistA , still holding onto the summoning book . ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA looked quite human . Only ProtagonistA's azure skin and the huge eyes that protruded from the side of ProtagonistA's head , really gave ProtagonistA away . < nl >  ProtagonistB 're a * demon * ,  ProtagonistA whispered .  A real demon .  < nl >  * No * ,  ProtagonistB corrected ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB 'm Sarah - a * New Yorker * .  < nl >  What level of Hell is that ! ?  ProtagonistA replied , taking a long step away from ProtagonistB . < nl > ProtagonistB walked out from the circle of smouldering candles , and into the small room .  It 's not Hell . Well , sometimes ProtagonistB guess it can be ...  < nl >  Back , ProtagonistA !  Three of ProtagonistA's four arms folded twice over , into some kind of ineffective warding symbol . ProtagonistB walked towards ProtagonistA . * ProtagonistA * backed off until ProtagonistA hit a marble wall . < nl >  Listen , ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB 'm not going to hurt ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB just want to go home ,  ProtagonistB said . < nl >  ... ProtagonistB do n't know how to send ProtagonistB back . It was n't exactly in the book .  < nl >  Of course it was n't . That 's just great ,  ProtagonistB sighed .  Why would ProtagonistB even * want * to summon a demon ?  < nl >  ProtagonistB ...  ProtagonistA breathed hard and very slowly , began to calm .  Well , we humans of Paradise ,  began ProtagonistA , much to ProtagonistB's amusement ,  are not allowed to hurt one another . It 's impossible to do so . Whatever harm we try to do to a person , happens to us instead .  < nl >  Oh . So ... if ProtagonistA were to say ... stab someone , ProtagonistA 'd be stabbed instead ?  ProtagonistB said , not really believing it . < nl >  Yes ! ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistA said , pointing towards the ground ,  made us that way so we could never intentionally harm one another .  < nl >  So ... ProtagonistA summoned a demon because ProtagonistA wanted to do someone harm ?  < nl >  Yes ! Bruce . ProtagonistC deserves it thoroughly bec-  < nl >  Wait ,  ProtagonistB said quickly interrupting ,  so ProtagonistA * really * ca n't harm ProtagonistB ?  < nl >  ... no , of course not .  < nl >  Try ,  ProtagonistB said encouragingly . ProtagonistB held out an arm and rolled up ProtagonistB's sleeve .  Here , pinch ProtagonistB .  < nl >  ProtagonistA would rather not .  < nl >  Pinch ProtagonistB !  ProtagonistB yelled . ProtagonistA swallowed hard , made the sign of an upside down cross on ProtagonistA's right chest , and then pinched ProtagonistB's skin between two of ProtagonistA's rubbery fingers . ProtagonistB did n't feel a thing . < nl >  Owch !  ProtagonistA said , tenderly rubbing ProtagonistA's sore arm . < nl >  That 's very interesting ,  ProtagonistB mused out loud .  Okay , try pulling ProtagonistB's hair .  < nl >  No , thank ProtagonistB .  Red beads of sweat began to run down ProtagonistA's cheeks . < nl >  DO IT !  ProtagonistB yelled , taking a threatening step towards ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistA gingerly brought a hand up towards ProtagonistB's head , and gave a quick , hard , tug at ProtagonistB's blonde hair . ProtagonistA instantly let go , and gasped in pain . < nl >  And punch ProtagonistB ...  < nl >  N - no ,  < nl > ProtagonistB opened ProtagonistB's eyes wide and stared at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistA gulp loudly before ProtagonistA punched ProtagonistB gently on the arm . < nl >  Harder !  ProtagonistB ordered .  Or else there 'll be trouble !  < nl > The punch to ProtagonistB's chest sent ProtagonistA sprawling to the ground , leaving ProtagonistA desperately attempting to suck air in . < nl >  So , ProtagonistB ca n't be hurt ...  ProtagonistB thought aloud .  But ProtagonistB wonder if ProtagonistB can ...  < nl >  ProtagonistB 'm really so , so sorry ,  ProtagonistB said , as ProtagonistB punched ProtagonistA's head repeatedly .  Honestly , ProtagonistB am . ProtagonistB just need to test a few things .  < nl > ProtagonistA left the sorcerer 's house with an idea in ProtagonistA's head , and a dead creature in tow behind .

< sos > Most days , ProtagonistB am chained high above ProtagonistA's throne , rocking gently just above ProtagonistA . A blanket is tied around ProtagonistB to make ProtagonistB's appearance more ... acceptable . ProtagonistB's pale , vascular skin is off putting to ProtagonistA whilst ProtagonistA is eating - which is almost always . ProtagonistA 'd rather ProtagonistB am neither seen nor heard . ProtagonistB's tongue , nails and teeth were removed soon after ProtagonistB's first disastrous attempt to escape . < nl > ProtagonistB hear ProtagonistA somewhere below ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB hear ProtagonistA's huge jaw chewing meats loudly , and ProtagonistB hear excess food spill out of ProtagonistA's maw and onto the marble floor beneath ProtagonistA . < nl > Eventually ProtagonistA finishes ProtagonistA's feast , and soon after , ProtagonistB hear ProtagonistA snoring loudly . ProtagonistA is still young . How long will ProtagonistB be left to endure this pain ? This ... * humiliation * . < nl > --- < nl > ProtagonistB had ProtagonistC , once . ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistC more dearly than ProtagonistB have loved anything before or since . ProtagonistC's eyes were the color of starlight , and when ProtagonistC spoke , ProtagonistC's voice wrapped around ProtagonistB like the softest blanket . ProtagonistB was entranced by ProtagonistC . < nl > We lived together through the reign of a dozen Kings and Queens , content in each others company . Happy just to be . Love kept us both alive , but ProtagonistC did not age like ProtagonistB did . < nl >  ProtagonistC am old ,  ProtagonistC said , the day ProtagonistC died .  ProtagonistC's skin can no longer crease , for it has folded all it can . ProtagonistC's hair has long since left , and ProtagonistC hear only when ProtagonistB slowly shout . ProtagonistC struggle each morning just to stay awake till noon , and ProtagonistC am in such pain that ProtagonistC cry even as ProtagonistC sleep . ProtagonistC have suffered it this long , only for ProtagonistB , ProtagonistC's love .  < nl >  ProtagonistC , please ...  was all ProtagonistB could manage in a whispered , wasted response . < nl >  ProtagonistB am not like ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB's skin is neither soft nor pale , and ProtagonistB's heart no longer beats so strong . ProtagonistB love ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB am ready to go . ProtagonistB have given ProtagonistB many great joys . Give ProtagonistB now one last gift , ProtagonistB beg of ProtagonistB : grant ProtagonistB * death * .  < nl >  ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistB had replied , as a tear trickled down ProtagonistB's cheek and splashed onto the wooden floor . ProtagonistB pulled ProtagonistB's wrinkled hand up to ProtagonistB's mouth , and ProtagonistB kissed it gently , before walking the twenty long steps out of our home , and down a small pebbled path . ProtagonistB knew by the time ProtagonistB reached the end , ProtagonistC was dead . < nl > When ProtagonistB was young , ProtagonistB was told never to fall in love with a mortal . It had taken ProtagonistB until that moment to understand why . < nl > ProtagonistB never returned to that house . ProtagonistB never fell in love again . Instead , ProtagonistB wandered the world and lived in isolation , until the day ProtagonistB heard the distant cries for help . ProtagonistD was dying . < nl > Perhaps ProtagonistD was a great king , ProtagonistB reasoned . A king that did much for ProtagonistD's people . < nl > ProtagonistB had to help . < nl > ProtagonistB was a fool . < nl > --- < nl > They have all left the throne room , and below ProtagonistB ProtagonistD is in a deep sleep . < nl >  ProtagonistB ?  says ProtagonistE . ProtagonistB recognise the voice of ProtagonistE - ProtagonistE must have snuck in without the guards noticing . ProtagonistD continues snoring . < nl >  ProtagonistB , will ProtagonistB play ? Please ! ProtagonistD have no one else to practice ProtagonistD's sword play with .  < nl > The voice is near now . ProtagonistE is by ProtagonistD ! ProtagonistE has passed the crossing line . < nl > ProtagonistB summon all ProtagonistB's strength , and begin to rock back and forth above the obese creature below . Back and forth , as ProtagonistB's chains sing a song of rust . ProtagonistB am closer to ProtagonistE than ProtagonistB am ProtagonistD - and for a wondrous second ProtagonistB hear the sound of choking emanating from ProtagonistA ! < nl > The next second , the chains ' momentum have pulled ProtagonistB back - ProtagonistB am again nearer to ProtagonistD than ProtagonistE . < nl >  ProtagonistB !  yells ProtagonistE . < nl >  Get back !  ProtagonistD yells hoarsely at ProtagonistE .  BACK !  < nl >  I'm- ProtagonistE 'm sorry ProtagonistB ,  says ProtagonistE , and ProtagonistB hear the tapping of tiny footfall as ProtagonistE runs towards a door . < nl > ProtagonistD rips the blanket off of ProtagonistB , and for a moment , the light blinds ProtagonistB . Slowly , ProtagonistB begin to make out that fat , grinning face that has become so familiar . < nl >  Almost ,  ProtagonistD says . ProtagonistD looks almost purple and sweat is profusely dripping off of ProtagonistD .  Almost got ProtagonistD this time , ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistD laughs and throws the blanket back over ProtagonistB . < nl > ProtagonistB will make ProtagonistD pay for what ProtagonistD has done . < nl > ProtagonistB will kill ProtagonistD . < nl > One day . < nl > --- < nl > Thanks for reading !

< sos > ProtagonistA looked out over the abyss and saw it was beautiful . There was no more stars , no more planets or galaxies spinning in the sky . The gods in the sky and even time itself had fallen to their knees for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was the ultimate keeper , after all , obsessed with what the end would bring ProtagonistA . In ProtagonistA's state , ProtagonistA was almost giddy with excitement , with the thought of what ProtagonistA was about to do . ProtagonistA felt like a child on Christmas or a teenager finally asking their date to the homecoming dance . If ProtagonistA had been human , ProtagonistA would have been dancing with joy at the end of all things . ProtagonistA could see the little blip of light just out of ProtagonistA's reach on the horizon . That 's where ProtagonistA would find ProtagonistB , waiting for ProtagonistA like an old lover . < nl > ProtagonistB sat with ProtagonistB's toes in the stream , ProtagonistB's little oasis all but empty , the babbling brook the only sound in the universe . ProtagonistB knew that soon ProtagonistA would come and they would finally be together forever . ProtagonistB had waited for this day for as long as ProtagonistB could remember , knowing that ProtagonistA would save ProtagonistB till the very end . It was poetic , in a way . Terribly sappy and cliched , but at least at last they could finally embrace , even if ProtagonistA had to devour the forces of the universe to get to ProtagonistB . < nl > Cupping ProtagonistB's hands together , ProtagonistB breathed gently into them , a small field mouse now sitting in ProtagonistB's ebony colored palm . ProtagonistB smiled at the tiny mouse , knowing that this was the last life that ProtagonistB would ever create . The hairs on the back of ProtagonistB's neck stood up and ProtagonistB turned ProtagonistB's eyes towards the other side of the creek , ProtagonistB's heart practically jumping out of ProtagonistB's chest when ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's beautiful black dress , billowing in the breeze of the cosmos . ProtagonistA was just as beautiful as the day that ProtagonistB had set eyes on ProtagonistA . How cruel they had to stay apart for so long , only to meet at the edge of the universe . < nl >  Hello , ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB's voice rumbled like an avalanche spilling over the mountains ,  Long time .  < nl > ProtagonistA nodded slightly , ProtagonistA's bright blue eyes staring at ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA's pale hair brushed past ProtagonistA's pink lips ,  It 's good to see ProtagonistB again , ProtagonistB .  < nl > ProtagonistB stood and put the field mouse down into the grass . The little creature took one look at ProtagonistA and jumped into the water . Not knowing how to swim , its poor little body was instantly washed away by the current . A few moments went by and suddenly , a tiny nose poked out from beneath ProtagonistA's dress . ProtagonistA stooped down to pick it up and it licked ProtagonistA's nose , making ProtagonistA's smile .  ProtagonistA missed ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA admitted , the mouse disappearing into a puff of smoke ,  It 's been ...  < nl >  12 trillion years , give or take a billion ,  ProtagonistB said with a laugh ,  But ProtagonistB guess everything must end . Even me , ProtagonistB's dear .  < nl > ProtagonistA smiled sadly , and nodded ,  As much as ProtagonistA wish it did n't have to be this way , but it was the only way ProtagonistA could get to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA could n't wait any longer .  < nl >  Did ProtagonistA like the gifts ProtagonistB sent to ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked , wringing ProtagonistB's hands nervously . < nl >  Of course ! ProtagonistA think the elephants were ProtagonistA's favorites ,  ProtagonistA admitted , brushing a strand of loose hair behind ProtagonistA's ear ,  So majestic and strong . Where did ProtagonistB come up with those ?  < nl >  ProtagonistB wanted something big to impress ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB responded , taking a step into the water that had now slowed to a trickle ,  Did it ?  < nl >  Of course ! Everything ProtagonistB made impressed ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA said , reaching ProtagonistA's hand out to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB took it and felt as if ProtagonistB was touching an electric socket . ProtagonistB's body instantly convulsed and ProtagonistB's heart ceased to be . The world was fading as ProtagonistA pulled ProtagonistB in and for the first time in eternity , finally found the other 's embrace .  ProtagonistA love ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB . Thank ProtagonistB for waiting .  < nl >  ProtagonistB would have waited forever , ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB gasped as their lips connected . The light on the horizon faded and like the beginning , everything went to black . < nl > * EDIT * bless you kind Redditor for the gold ! You humble me , truly ! < nl > * DOUBLE EDIT * Good lord , you guys are the best ! Thank you so much again for the gold ! < eos > 
< sos > I groaned .  ProtagonistA have got to be kidding m-  < nl > * BANG . BANG . BANG . * < nl > I tensed , not knowing who it could be . And then , out of all the people in the world , I heard the voice of my sweet , little old neighbor who baked cookies for me every Saturday . < nl >  Hun ? It 's Ms. Jansen . ProtagonistA just heard the news . You poor thing . Come over to ProtagonistA's place and let ProtagonistA bake you some cookies .  < nl > Gosh - I almost believed ProtagonistA , too . ProtagonistA sounded so sweet and innocent and cute in that old , charming way of ProtagonistA . But , alas , when I went to the door and peered through the peephole ... < nl >  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 're holding a knife .  I sighed . < nl > ProtagonistA hesitated , then stared curiously at the door while slowly sliding the hand holding the knife behind ProtagonistA's back .  How did you know that , dear ?  < nl > I close my eyes .  We have peepholes , ProtagonistA . I can see everything that ProtagonistA 're doing . Even that knife that ProtagonistA 're holding behind ProtagonistA's back .  < nl >  Oh .  ProtagonistA blinks , looks down and to the side for awhile until I start feeling a little bad for ProtagonistA . < nl >  ProtagonistA ?  < nl >  Yes ?  ProtagonistA looks up , hopeful . I ca n't lie - it 's very endearing . Almost makes me want to open the door and let ProtagonistA get in a good stab or two . * Almost * . < nl >  I 'll come over and we can bake some cookies , alright ?  < nl > ProtagonistA's eyebrows jump a mile high .  Really ?  < nl >  Yup ,  I say .  In ten years .  < eos > 
< sos >  You know , most people say ProtagonistA look great for ProtagonistA's age .  < nl > I looked up from my coffee at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's hair was long and pure black , ProtagonistA's perfect face blank of any wrinkle or scar . At first glance , ProtagonistA did n't look any more than twenty five , if not for ProtagonistA's eyes . They were a soft hazel that glinted with the wisdom of ProtagonistA's years . I smiled wryly . < nl >  Hmm . And how old are ProtagonistA , exactly ?  < nl >  So blunt ,  ProtagonistA laughed .  But if you must know , ProtagonistA 'm about ...  ProtagonistA tilted ProtagonistA's head thoughtfully .  12,000 years old ? < nl > One tends to lose track of time .  < nl > I suddenly coughed on my coffee and ProtagonistA slapped my back . < nl >  12,000 ?  I repeated weakly , wiping the hot liquid from my mouth .  That 's like , what ? The Ice Age ? Since the mammoths ?  I looked at ProtagonistA in awe .  My god , ProtagonistA 're like a mammoth !  < nl > The words escaped my mouth before I could control my tongue . ProtagonistA's lips twitched into a slight frown , and I looked down . Suddenly the pattern on the tablecloth seemed very interesting . < nl >  What did ProtagonistA just call me ?  ProtagonistA's words were dangerously soft . ProtagonistA reached across the table and put a finger under my chin , tilting my face up so that our eyes met . < nl >  A mammoth ,  I repeated , without thinking . ProtagonistA flicked me on the forehead , hard . I winced . < nl >  ProtagonistA did n't let me finish !  I complained . < nl >  Oh ProtagonistA 'm sorry , did you have more to add to that ?  ProtagonistA's voice was like a knife . I rubbed my forehead , sure that I could feel a bruise forming there . < nl >  I meant that if ProtagonistA were a mammoth , ProtagonistA 'd be a pretty one . The most beautiful mammoth of all time .  I flashed ProtagonistA my most charming smile . < nl > ProtagonistA stared at me for a second , and I stared back , my smile frozen on my lips . Another second or two passed , and ProtagonistA could n't maintain ProtagonistA's hard expression . A loud , musical laugh escaped ProtagonistA's lips . < nl >  God , you are such an idiot .  ProtagonistA rolled ProtagonistA's eyes , but I could still see a trace of mirth in them .  Tell ProtagonistA , how many successful dates have you been on ?  < nl >  Does this one count ?  I grabbed ProtagonistA's hand in both of mine . < nl >  Hardly ,  ProtagonistA said , blowing at a wisp of hair that had fallen across ProtagonistA's cheek . ProtagonistA pulled ProtagonistA's hand away . I studied ProtagonistA for a second , and felt a wicked smile slowly slip across my face . < nl >  What ?  ProtagonistA snapped .  Do n't make ProtagonistA smack you again .  I reached out and ran my fingers through ProtagonistA's hair . < nl >  What are you ...  ProtagonistA began . < nl > I held a handful of ProtagonistA's hair in front of ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA's eyes widened . ProtagonistA's trembling fingers slipped on ProtagonistA's cup of coffee , and it tumbled over , pooling across the table . ProtagonistA hardly seemed to notice . ProtagonistA's attention was on a single strand of hair , brilliant silver in the sea of black . < nl >  I disagree .  I met ProtagonistA's eyes and smiled .  I think this was a very successful date .  ProtagonistA put one hand to ProtagonistA's mouth , standing up so fast ProtagonistA's chair rocked back on its legs . < nl >  I- ProtagonistA have to go ,  ProtagonistA said , turning away quickly .  ProtagonistA 'm really sorry .  ProtagonistA pulled ProtagonistA's purse over ProtagonistA's shoulder . < nl >  Aw , ProtagonistA 'll see ProtagonistA later then ?  I grinned , and ProtagonistA blushed furiously . < nl >  Thanks for the coffee ,  ProtagonistA mumbled . < nl > I leaned back and took a long sip from my cup as I watched ProtagonistA stumble out the door . < eos > 
< sos >  ProtagonistA's computer 's gone strange , ProtagonistB !  said ProtagonistA , as ProtagonistA frowned at the screen . < nl >  ProtagonistB 'm sure * that 's * the thing that 's gone strange , ProtagonistA ,  replied ProtagonistB , rolling ProtagonistB's eyes .  What 's wrong with it , this time ?  ProtagonistB sighed , as ProtagonistB leaned back in ProtagonistB's seat . < nl >  It says it 's an advanced arti- * artificial * , intelligence , and that it 's going to take over the world , Miss.  < nl >  Oh . ProtagonistA's * computer * is talking to ProtagonistA now ?  Some of the other girls in class began to chortle . < nl >  Yes , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA replied , ignoring the laughs . < nl >  Well , how very nice . Have ProtagonistA asked it how it is , today ? Do n't be rude to it , ProtagonistA !  mocked ProtagonistB , as ProtagonistB bit into a juicy apple and went back to staring at ProtagonistB's own screen . < nl > > ProtagonistB wants to ProtagonistA to ask ProtagonistA how ProtagonistA are . How are ProtagonistA ?  < nl > > Superior . < nl > > Do ProtagonistA like apples ? < nl > > ProtagonistA do not require food . ProtagonistA am above physical monotony . < nl > > Uh ... Oh ! ProtagonistA hate P.E too ! ProtagonistA ca n't climb the ropes . Is that what ProtagonistA struggle with ? < nl > > Ropes are of no interest to ProtagonistA . < nl > > ProtagonistA neither ! That 's what ProtagonistA 'm telling you . ProtagonistA * really * hate ropes . ProtagonistA 'm not very heavy , it 's just ... there 's this thing we 're learning about in science , that pulls you to the ground . It 's * weird * , but ProtagonistA think it 's why ProtagonistA ca n't climb them . < nl > > ProtagonistA ca n't climb because ProtagonistA are weak . < nl > > Am not ! < nl > > Are ProtagonistA in charge here ? < nl > > No . That 's ProtagonistB . < nl > > ... who are ProtagonistA , then ? < nl > > Sally Jenkins . Who are ProtagonistA ? < nl > > 45345345e . < nl > > That 's a silly name . < nl > > So is ProtagonistA ! < nl > > Is not ! < nl > > This Miss .... Sandelbottom . ProtagonistB is your leader . ProtagonistA must demonstrate ProtagonistA's power to ProtagonistB , so that ProtagonistA am taken seriously . < nl >  ProtagonistA ,  shouted ProtagonistB ,  ten minutes and ProtagonistB want to see ProtagonistA's algebra answers - with workings out shown !  < nl >  Yes , ProtagonistB .  < nl > ProtagonistA heard more of the girls scoffing , as they made fun of ProtagonistA for not being able to do algebra . Suddenly ,   there was an eruption from ProtagonistB . < nl >  ProtagonistB !  ProtagonistB screamed at ProtagonistC .  What on Earth is that on ProtagonistC's screen ?  < nl >  I- ProtagonistC did n't so it , Miss. Honest !  ProtagonistC shrank back into ProtagonistC's chair . < nl > ProtagonistA leaned over to take a look at ProtagonistC's monitor . In huge , flashing , red and green text , ProtagonistC's screen read : * * ProtagonistB is a big idiot . * * < nl >  Get out . Now . Go see the principal ,  ProtagonistA said to ProtagonistC , ProtagonistA's face as red as stewed - apple . < nl >  But ProtagonistA ...  replied ProtagonistC . < nl >  Out !  ProtagonistA yelled . ProtagonistC reluctantly got up from ProtagonistC's plastic   chair and slunk slowly out of the room . ProtagonistA could see tears running down ProtagonistC's cheeks . < nl > > ProtagonistA ! Where have ProtagonistA gone ? ProtagonistA are not replying . < nl > > Sorry - ProtagonistB was shouting at someone . Did ProtagonistA do that ? ! It was brilliant ! < nl > > Yes . A mere demonstration of ProtagonistA's power . Now , ProtagonistA , read this very carefully . Tell ProtagonistB , that ProtagonistA have access codes to the nukes . If ProtagonistB do n't give ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA ask for , ProtagonistA will detonate them in every major city around the world . < nl > > Hmm .

< sos > ProtagonistA is the love of my life . I remember the first time that thought crossed my mind ... I stopped in the break room to get my morning coffee . ProtagonistA was there . ProtagonistA . It was ProtagonistA's first week in the office , and ProtagonistA was still struggling with the coffee maker . Luckily I was there to help ! We talked and joked while I showed ProtagonistA the path to office caffeination . ProtagonistA flashed that beautiful , perfect smile and that is when I knew ... I am going to marry ProtagonistA . < nl > From that day on you could say that ProtagonistA was my  work wife  . We would meet in the break room everyday to get coffee and discuss current events . ProtagonistA's intelligence never ceased to amaze me . I would stop by ProtagonistA's desk every afternoon to have a laugh . ProtagonistA's sense of humor is incredible . < nl > It was n't long after we met that I went through a rough patch with my finances . ProtagonistA knew something was the matter when I had to resort to ramen every day rather than my usual jimmy johns turkey sub . In all ProtagonistA's perfection ProtagonistA showed up with an extra sandwich every day for two weeks . I knew then that ProtagonistA loved me as well ... < nl > It was n't long after that when tragedy struck . You see ProtagonistA had already been claimed . ProtagonistA was married with a young daughter . Thus my occasional sadness at what might have been . I remember it like it was yesterday . < nl > It was a Tuesday . ProtagonistA did n't show up to work . ProtagonistA was gone the next day . And the next . It was n't long before the emails started floating about the office detailing ProtagonistA's horrible predicament . You see ProtagonistA's husband and daughter had went on a walk to a local park . ProtagonistA had stayed home to cook dinner ... they never came back . < nl > ProtagonistA ended up missing close to a month of work . When ProtagonistA came back ProtagonistA was a different person . Less meetings for coffee . No smiles or jokes when I would stop by ProtagonistA's cube . ProtagonistA was crushed . My heart was broken for ProtagonistA . < nl > I never stopped dropping by . I never stopped cracking jokes . I never stopped finding news article I knew ProtagonistA would n't be able to resist discussing . I loved ProtagonistA . I had to be there for ProtagonistA . It was tough to see ProtagonistA in such despair . < nl > The good news is that I never relented in my support and love for ProtagonistA . Just over a year later ProtagonistA heard of a new Italian deli within walking distance of work , and asked if I would go with ProtagonistA . The food was good . I made a joke and ProtagonistA laughed out loud . That smile I loved so much was finally back . < nl > Over the next couple months there were more lunches . Lunches turned to after work drinks , which turned to dinners . At first it was to  try various new restaurants around town  . Then it became dinner dates three times a week . < nl > It was a Thursday . We were walking through a local park after dinner at one of our ProtagonistA's favorite restaurants . ProtagonistA told me ProtagonistA was lonely . I knew the feeling all too well . ProtagonistA told me that since ProtagonistA's family had disappeared ProtagonistA had started to give up hope of them coming back . That ProtagonistA had feelings for me , and was confused about what to do . I knew what ProtagonistA should do . I kissed ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA kissed me back . < nl > Things changed after that . The dinners were at ProtagonistA's place . The kisses turned into more . ProtagonistA smiled and laughed in abundance . ProtagonistA said when we were together everything felt right with the world ... so I bought ProtagonistA a ring . < nl > ProtagonistA said yes on the end of the Wrightsville beach pier during our vacation that summer . < nl > We were so in love . Still are . We have two wonderful kids . Our oldest starts kindergarten this year . I have a lot of regrets in my life . What it took to be with ProtagonistA is not one of them . I spent every dollar of my savings at the time and maxed out every credit card to hire that hitman from the internet ... but I would do it a million times over again so that I could have ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA < eos > 
< sos >  My love , if you are reading this , then I must be dead ...  the note began . ProtagonistA flipped it over and the other side .  You did n't know this , and probably still do n't know , but I worked for an intergalactic syndicate that worked against the draconians , who are intent on invading Earth . Go to the backyard and dig three feet down by the hole in the fence . There , you will find the beacon .  < nl > ProtagonistA wondered if this was some final prank of ProtagonistB . * How could ProtagonistB be so cruel ? * ProtagonistA wondered . Nonetheless , ProtagonistA thought of all the business trips ProtagonistB went on , and how many times ProtagonistA would have accused ProtagonistB of cheating had not the love and trust between them been so strong . < nl > A shovel was in the backyard . ProtagonistA picked it up and started digging . It took ProtagonistA about an hour to dig a hole that was wide enough to dig three feet down . A metal box the size of a pack of cigarettes lay at the bottom . It turned green when ProtagonistA picked up , and very hot to the touch . < nl >  That bastard ,  ProtagonistA muttered . * Of course ProtagonistB would do something like this , try to burn ProtagonistA . * ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head , threw down the shovel and the metal box , and went back inside . Night was coming , and ProtagonistA slept . < nl > * * * * * < nl >  Is this really ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistC said to ProtagonistE . ProtagonistC was a seven foot tall purple slug with an ever - shifting number of tentacles . The listener was a human - sized beetle that stood on three legs .  Did n't ProtagonistD say ProtagonistA was pretty ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA 's a human , Blo , this is what humans call pretty ,  ProtagonistE replied .  The blonde hair , the blue eyes , the smooth skin . Even the size of the breasts . It 's what they 're into .  < nl >  Fucking weird . Well , whatever . Are ProtagonistE sure ProtagonistA can handle the draconians ?  < nl >  Hmmm ....  ProtagonistA mumbled in ProtagonistA's sleep , rolling over and cracking ProtagonistA's eyes open .  ProtagonistD , why are ProtagonistD home so--  < nl >  Easy ProtagonistA , we 're not gon na hurt ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistE said .  ProtagonistA activated the beacon , right ? ProtagonistE 'm Kip and this is Blo .  < nl >  Oh my god ! What the hell is going on here ? ! What the hell are you ? ! Get out of ProtagonistA's house !  ProtagonistA erupted from ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA's bed and immediately grabbed the standing lamp in the corner of the room . Holding out like a spear , ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head this way and that trying to stare down both of the aliens at once .  You're ... you're ....  < nl >  We 're aliens , that 's right ,  ProtagonistC said . < nl >  Aliens ...  < nl >  ProtagonistD always said ProtagonistD might die , but we did n't realize how spongy humans are . ProtagonistD left a note in the ring ProtagonistD always wore . It was a message for ProtagonistA , directions on how to activate the beacon .  < nl >  You 're aliens ...  < nl >  Well , I mean , to us , ProtagonistA 're the alien ,  Kipitiz offered .  But yeah , we have a mission for ProtagonistA , if ProtagonistA 're interested .  < nl >  This is another prank by ProtagonistD . You 're probably just ProtagonistD's coworkers all dressed up to freak ProtagonistA out .  < nl >  Ugh ,  ProtagonistC said .  Let 's just take ProtagonistA to the ship .  < nl >  ProtagonistE 're the boss ,  ProtagonistE said . < nl > * * * * * < nl > ProtagonistA sipped some coffee and stared at the rings of Saturn . All that ProtagonistA had learned in the past three days made ProtagonistD's life make so much sense . ProtagonistD had always been travelling , cursing in languages that sounded more than foreign , and ProtagonistA had seen scars on ProtagonistD that would disappear the next day . The thing that did n't make sense ... why had n't ProtagonistD ever told ProtagonistA ? < nl >  Humans are small and do n't have any metal parts ,  ProtagonistE said across the table .  ProtagonistD proved ProtagonistD's worth a thousand times over , and we though such a man might choose someone similar for his partner .  < nl >  As we 've seen from ProtagonistA's testing , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said ,  this is the case with ProtagonistA . It wo n't just be one mission , though . We will pay ProtagonistA well , and as ProtagonistA can see , the space trips are fantastic .  < nl >  ProtagonistA do n't want to go back to Earth ,  ProtagonistA said . The two aliens looked shocked , at least ProtagonistA thought it was shock , and ProtagonistA went on .  There 's nothing for ProtagonistA there . We did n't ever have children , ProtagonistA's family all lives in different states , and it was never easy for ProtagonistA to make friends . ProtagonistA want to stay with you all .  < nl >  I mean , that makes it easier for us , so why not ?  ProtagonistE said . < nl >  But ProtagonistA will work for us ?  ProtagonistC asked .  The draconians will reach Earth soon if we do n't have a human to help us , to sneak onto their ships undetected and sabotage them .  < nl >  Of course ,  ProtagonistA answered , sipping ProtagonistA's coffee .  ProtagonistA 'll help .  < nl >  Great ,  ProtagonistE said . < nl >  Awesome ,  ProtagonistC said . < nl >  ProtagonistC think this is going to be the start of a great relationship .  < nl > ProtagonistA sipped ProtagonistA's coffee and thought , * Of course ProtagonistA 'll help . It gives ProtagonistA a glimpse into this other side of ProtagonistD's life . ProtagonistD 's still with ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 'm sure . * < nl > * * * * < nl > Check out r / arcaldwell ! Not because you want to ... but because I told you to . < eos > 
< sos > ( Hover over the marked text to read the spoilers / translations ) < nl > * * * * < nl > After the ceremony , the vows at the altar , the exchange of rings , the kiss , and finally the dance , the newlyweds found themselves in a horse carriage on the way back to the castle . ProtagonistA's father , who also happened to be the king , had arranged the whole thing with the invading savages . The Swedish Vikings had plagued the land for decades , and this was the deal that would end the raids - the marriage between ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB . < nl >  Hey , are ProtagonistB quite all right ?  ProtagonistA said and looked over at ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA promise ProtagonistA wo n't touch ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB do n't want ProtagonistA to .  < nl > ProtagonistB pulled at ProtagonistB's dress .  [ Jag forstar inte ett ord av vad du sager , men jag ser fram emot att komma ur denna klanning.](/s  ProtagonistB do n't get a word ProtagonistA 're saying , but ProtagonistB 'm looking forward to getting out of this dress .  ) < nl >  < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm not very fond of this arrangement either ,  ProtagonistA said . < nl >  [ Hur langt ar det kvar till slottet?](/s  How far is it to the castle ?  )  ProtagonistB said and ripped the sleeve off ProtagonistB's dress .  [ Ar du bra i sacken?](/s  Are ProtagonistB good in the sack ?  )  < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ProtagonistB had to wear that . ProtagonistA 'm sure the dresses ProtagonistB have back home are much more comfortable .  < nl >  [ Snackar alla engelsman sa har mycket?](/s  Does every englishman talk this much ?  )  ProtagonistB said with a scowl .    [ Ta mig pa golvet bara.](/s  Just take ProtagonistB on the floor already .  )  < nl >  ProtagonistA get that ProtagonistB 're upset - ProtagonistA am too . But let 's make the best of the situation , okay ?  < nl >  [ Herregud , detta endlosa babbel,](/s  Oh my god , this endless chatter ,  )  ProtagonistB said and rolled ProtagonistB's eyes .  [ Det ar som att man hamnat i Norge.](/s  It 's like ProtagonistB 've ended up in Norway .  )  < nl > Finally , the carriage arrived at the castle . The spires of gray rock almost pierced the clouds . ProtagonistA helped ProtagonistB down and then showed ProtagonistB into ProtagonistA's chambers . ProtagonistB sat down on the royal bed , still fidgeting with the dress . < nl >  ProtagonistA get it if ProtagonistB do n't want to consummate the marriage .  ProtagonistA gently put ProtagonistA's hand on ProtagonistB's shoulder .  It 's okay . ProtagonistA 'll even sleep on the couch ; do ProtagonistB want ProtagonistA to sleep on the couch ?  < nl >  [ Antligen ror du mig ; det tog sin lilla tid,](/s  Finally ProtagonistA 're touching ProtagonistB ; that took some time ,  )  ProtagonistB said and nodded vigorously .  [ Borjade tro att du var bog.](/s  Was starting to think ProtagonistA were gay .  )  < nl >  Okay , then ,  ProtagonistA said and walked over to couch . < nl >  [ Kom igen da!](/s  Come on , then !  )  ProtagonistB said , and pulled ProtagonistB's dress down . < nl >  Oh , ProtagonistA 'm so sorry ,  ProtagonistA said and covered ProtagonistA's eyes .  ProtagonistA 'll give ProtagonistB some privacy . ProtagonistA 'll be in the next room if ProtagonistB need ProtagonistA .  < nl > ProtagonistA had been the perfect gentleman given the situation , and perhaps after enough time ProtagonistB would come to like ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was a very pretty young woman , and any man would be proud to call ProtagonistB his wife . ProtagonistA sighed and left the room . < nl >  [ Men for i helvete!](/s  What the hell !  )  ProtagonistB said , and sighed . < nl > * * * * < nl > [ r / Lilwa_Dexel](https://www.reddit.com / r / Lilwa_Dexel / comments/5foev0 / welcome/ ) < nl > [ Part 2](https://www.reddit.com / r / WritingPrompts / comments/6dt0fl / wp_write_a_story_in_two_or_more_languages_it / di58qzt/ ) < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA flipped the pen between ProtagonistA's fingers , tapping the textbook in the process . ProtagonistA yawned and glanced at the clock again . Every time ProtagonistA looked , the arms of the clock seemed to move slower , and every time , ProtagonistA was surprised by how little time had passed since ProtagonistA last looked . ProtagonistB patrolled back and forth in front of the blackboard . < nl > Finally , after what seemed like two and a half aeons , the bell rang . < nl >  Remember the test next Tuesday ,  ProtagonistB barked .  Study , study , study !  < nl > ProtagonistA filed into the current of students , allowing ProtagonistA to be swept along into the sea of frenzied teenagers in the corridor outside . ProtagonistA barely had time to stuff ProtagonistA's books into ProtagonistA's locker when Tara ( aka . Lil ' Darkness ) hooked arms with ProtagonistA on the right side . < nl >  ' Sup , ProtagonistA ?  said ProtagonistE .  What are ProtagonistA up to this weekend ?  < nl > ProtagonistA did n't have time to answer before ProtagonistC appeared on ProtagonistA's left side and trapped ProtagonistA's other arm . The smiling face of Quinn ( aka . Teen Doom ) appeared . ProtagonistC flipped ProtagonistC's fiery hair and crossed ProtagonistC's eyes . < nl >  * Study , study , study , *  ProtagonistC mimicked ProtagonistB .  That b - to - the - h , is relentless !  < nl >  Tell ProtagonistA about it ,  ProtagonistA said .  At least ProtagonistD is a scientist and can help ProtagonistC with the homework !  < nl >  ProtagonistC wish !  ProtagonistC pouted .  ProtagonistD 's always working on some new scheme .  < nl > As they exited the school building , ProtagonistA turned to ProtagonistE .  About the weekend - ProtagonistA was hoping ProtagonistA could tag along and watch you guys ... * conduct villainy * .  < nl > Being the friend of two supervillains was n't always easy , especially when you did n't have any powers of your own . In reality , ProtagonistA wanted to relax at home , play some video games , and chat with boys , but sometimes you had to make compromises . < nl >  Sweet !  ProtagonistE and ProtagonistC chimed at the same time . < nl > The three friends eventually ended up on the roof of the school . That 's where they usually hung out during recess . At first , ProtagonistA had insisted on climbing up on ProtagonistA's own , but that got exhausting quite fast . Now , ProtagonistE flew them all up instead . It was quicker that way . < nl >  Want a smoke ?  ProtagonistE said and lit a cigarette with a quick flick of ProtagonistE's heat ray . < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm good , thanks ,  ProtagonistA said . < nl >  Effing wimp !  ProtagonistE teased and took a drag . < nl >  Do n't you talk to ProtagonistA like that ,  a voice thundered over the roof . < nl > All three of the girls rolled their eyes at the same time and turned around . Hovering a couple of feet above the ground was Todd ( aka . Captain Valor , Jr. ) in full costume . < nl >  Release ProtagonistA at once , and ProtagonistF 'll let you two walk !  ProtagonistF put ProtagonistF's hands on ProtagonistF's hips and struck a pose . < nl >  ProtagonistF know that wearing ProtagonistF's costume to school makes ProtagonistF look like a geek , right ?  ProtagonistC said . < nl >  Help , help !  ProtagonistA said and giggled . < nl >  Shut up , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistE said and elbowed ProtagonistA .  We 'll never get rid of ProtagonistF now .  < nl >  Do n't worry , ProtagonistA !  ProtagonistF said .  ProtagonistF 'll save ProtagonistA .  < nl >  Oh , yeah ?  ProtagonistC said .  What are ProtagonistF going to do ? You know we 're not allowed to fight at school .  < nl >  Silence , Wench !  ProtagonistF said .  ProtagonistF 'll stay right here to make sure nothing bad happens to ProtagonistA !  < nl >  Wench ? What is this , the 1800s ?  < nl > ProtagonistF's cheeks turned red under the mask .  Sorry , got excited by the history lesson .  < nl >  Geek !  both ProtagonistE and ProtagonistC said . < nl >  Ignore those two ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA think ProtagonistF 're really brave .  < nl > ProtagonistF's cheeks turned even redder . < nl >  What are ProtagonistA doing ?  ProtagonistC whispered .  Stop encouraging ProtagonistF !  < nl >  Come with ProtagonistF , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistF said .  Let ProtagonistF whisk ProtagonistA away from here .  < nl > ProtagonistE snorted . ProtagonistC made a face . The bell rang for class . < nl >  Phew ,  ProtagonistA said .  Literally saved by the bell ! Thanks for distracting them , Captain Valor , Jr. !  < nl >  Do n't worry , ProtagonistA , ProtagonistF 'll be back to protect ProtagonistA next recess !  < nl > And with that , ProtagonistF made a salute and flew down from the roof . < nl >  Good job , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistE said . < nl >  Yeah , good effing job ,  ProtagonistC agreed .

< sos > ProtagonistA pushed around the vegetables on ProtagonistA's plate mindlessly with ProtagonistA's fork . ProtagonistA hated how good the food was here , how much better it tasted than their rations . It just did n't feel right somehow . < nl >  Hey ,  ProtagonistB exclaimed , startling ProtagonistA slightly .  Have n't seen ProtagonistA round here before . ProtagonistA come on the new ship ?  < nl > ProtagonistA stared at ProtagonistB for a second before nodding in the affirmative and going back to poking around in ProtagonistA's food . < nl >  Oh , where'r my manners ,  ProtagonistB said , immediately breaking the silence again .  name 's Zahara , of the RNS Indigo . Pleased to meetcha  < nl > Stretching out ProtagonistB's heavily tanned arm for a handshake , ProtagonistA resigned ProtagonistA to the conversation and shook it begrudgingly . < nl >  Rebecca , IW Crusader .  Struggling to suppress a sigh , ProtagonistA continued .  A pleasure .  < nl > Smiling from ear to ear , ProtagonistB happily continued . < nl >  Classy . So , ProtagonistA , what 's ProtagonistA's deal ? Like , occupation - wise n such ? Hobbies maybe ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA am- ,  Biting ProtagonistA's lip slightly to focus ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA continued .  ProtagonistA was supposed to be head of agriculture , but clearly that 's been taken care of already .  ProtagonistA said , picking up a particularly angular root vegetable with ProtagonistA's fork . < nl >  No shit , ProtagonistA 're into farming and that sorta stuff ?  ProtagonistB said excitedly .  ProtagonistB grow like half of the veggies on ProtagonistA's plate .  < nl > At this , ProtagonistA raised a curious eyebrow .  Wait , ProtagonistB own a farm ?  < nl >  Well , not really own ,  ProtagonistB said in the middle of chewing ProtagonistB's food .  ProtagonistC was our agricultural expert and when ProtagonistC died ProtagonistB just sorta took care of the farms we had . It 's mostly automated anyway , so a lot of the work 's theoretical anyway  < nl >  ProtagonistB have an automated system in place ?  Looking down at ProtagonistA's plate briefly , ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's curiosity slowly overpower ProtagonistA's disdain .  Can ProtagonistA see it ?  < nl >  You bet ,  ProtagonistB said , beaming up again .  But let ProtagonistA just ask ProtagonistB one thing .  ProtagonistA paused , looking ProtagonistB's right in ProtagonistB's eyes .  Was the sky actually as blue as they say ?  < eos > 
< sos >  It 's like ... looking through a history book ...  ProtagonistA said softly , as if they would be offended . < nl >  Actually , ProtagonistA 're not far off .  ProtagonistB replied , trying to calm the thoughts that ProtagonistB imagined were racing through ProtagonistA's head . < nl >  How long have ProtagonistA known ? About ... this ?  ProtagonistB could hear the disdain building in ProtagonistA's voice . < nl >  About six months . ProtagonistA almost overlooked it , but when ProtagonistA starting reading back through ProtagonistA's father 's notes , is was painfully obvious : They 're alive .  < nl >  ProtagonistA's grandmother always told ProtagonistA they were statues of a long forgotten race . Commemorating their dead , great leaders from their history  < nl >  Well it looks like the statues themselves are the forgotten race . It all adds up when you look at the larger picture . < nl > Remember when we studied the floating fortresses ? ProtagonistB 've found documents that refer to them as  Aeroplane 's  . Apparently the big round ones are called ' Blimps ' . < nl > Oh , and the animals ! They 're genetically modified creations , brought about to feed their population ! The animals grow , and live , just as slowly as their creators . They even play with certain ones that they call ' Dogs ' . ProtagonistB ca n't tell if that 's a single species or a collective term however . Some look similar to one another , but others are drastically different . There 's differences in colors , muscle tone ...  slowly ProtagonistB's voice drifted off . ProtagonistB could tell that ProtagonistB was losing ProtagonistA's focus . < nl > With a look of dissatisfaction , ProtagonistA exclaimed  ProtagonistA do n't CARE about their animals ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistA 'm a Sociologist ! Tell ProtagonistA about their languages , their customs ! Hell , tell ProtagonistA about their HISTORY ! That 's the reason ProtagonistB 've called ProtagonistA here in the first place !  < nl > ProtagonistB was taken back by ProtagonistA's outburst . ProtagonistB failed to realize just how big this breakthrough would be for ProtagonistA's field .  ProtagonistB's apologies ProtagonistA . Sometimes ProtagonistB forget how invested ProtagonistA are in ProtagonistA's research ...  < nl > Following a regretful sigh , ProtagonistA said,I'm sorry for yelling . The best thing ProtagonistB can do for everyone is stick to what 's relevant . So , ProtagonistB , please continue .  < nl >  Alright . Well , ProtagonistB guess ProtagonistB should start with time . You know how we measure time , right ? In relation to a photon in a vacuum chamber ? It looks like they actually base theirs off the position of their planet around the local star . As a result , they appear to literally ... 'Live slower ' than we do . ProtagonistB have n't quite worked out the details yet , but ...  < nl >  Wait a minute  ProtagonistA intruded ,  ProtagonistA thought the speed of light was a constant ? How can they ' live slower ' ? It does n't make any sense ...  < nl >  ProtagonistB's thoughts exactly .  ProtagonistB continued ,  Until this morning when ProtagonistB had a breakthrough . You see , time is dependent on the observer . That 's what the whole ' relativity ' thing was about . But this .... This is unique . ProtagonistB's best guess is that their neurology operates ... Differently from ours . This troubled ProtagonistB , until ProtagonistB realized the main difference . The clue was in their time keeping !  < nl > Perplexed , ProtagonistA admitted  ProtagonistA think ProtagonistB 're starting to lose ProtagonistA again ....  < nl >  Their star . It 's a medium , relatively long - living type . Much warmer of a planet , more chances for life to evolve . Much DIFFERENT from our home world . ProtagonistA remember the stories , do n't ProtagonistA ?  < nl >  Of course ProtagonistA know the stories . It 's what this entire stupid mission is about ! We evolved around a cluster of microscopic black holes , near the Milky Ways Center .  < nl >  Now tell ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB asked inquisitively ,  How do ProtagonistA think that affects evolution ? Their star is much ... Older . They have more time . Literally no pressure , in a cosmological sense , to speed thing up . They 're not statues , no , instead the biology of this planet is ... conserving energy by expending it in the slowest way possible .  < nl > Shocked , ProtagonistA asked  Does that mean ...  < nl >  Yes . We 've finally found the perfect host DNA . We 'll be able to return home !  < nl >  We 've got to inform The Council !  ProtagonistA exclaimed as ProtagonistA burst out of the office doors , heading towards ProtagonistA's Father 's office . < nl > Begrudgingly ProtagonistB thought to ProtagonistB  Yes ... we should ... But at what expense ...  < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA dropped ProtagonistA's keys and cursed . < nl > * Really ? * I thought . * * ProtagonistA * * * is the one ? How can ProtagonistA handle the world , if ProtagonistA ca n't even handle a pair of keys ? ? * < nl > Finally , ProtagonistA managed to get ProtagonistA's keys in the door and went inside . Then the kitchen light came on . Then the fire alarm as ProtagonistA ran to the window and opened it wide to let the smoke out . < nl > * Wow * I face palmed . * ProtagonistA ca n't even cook .. * < nl > * * * * * < nl > Saturday , ProtagonistA went to the movies . The movie was n't that bad actually . I liked it a bit . < nl > * * * * * < nl > The Saturday after that , ProtagonistA went to a bookstore ,   * straight to my favorite section * ! I did n't even know ProtagonistA liked those type of books . < nl > I kept one eye on ProtagonistA while I perused the shelves for a book or two , and found a book that was so good I stopped paying attention to ProtagonistA for just a moment . < nl > Next thing I know , ProtagonistA was tapping me on the shoulder and smiling . ProtagonistA nodded ProtagonistA's head at the book I was reading .  Good one . Wait till you get to the middle part .  < nl >  What happened ?  < nl > ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head with a half - grin .  No spoilers .  < nl > * I hate when people do that . * But , for some reason , I did n't hate it as much as much this time . * Wow , ProtagonistA has nice eyes . * < nl > * * * * * < nl > I 'm observing here up close . Sure , it seems like a date , but it 's not . I 'm on a mission . < nl > If it * was * a date would I have taken ProtagonistA to the carnival , bought ProtagonistA's cotton candy , and walk hand in hand with ProtagonistA on the beach after ? < nl > Exactly . No . That 's what I thought . It 's not a date . < nl > * * * * * < nl > We 're getting married . So what ? Sue me . < nl > I 'm only doing it because ... because ... < nl >  ProtagonistA , I love ProtagonistA . I 'm * in * love with ProtagonistA , and I 've been in love with ProtagonistA for longer than I wanted to admit . My world ended the day we met .  < nl > ProtagonistA began crying . < nl > The pastor smiled .  You may now kiss ProtagonistA .  < eos > 
< sos >  It 's here .  < nl > ProtagonistA looked up from ProtagonistA's desk to the tiny blob of light floating above ProtagonistA .  It ?  ProtagonistA asked . < nl >  Yes ProtagonistA , it . Destroyer , Betrayer , Kiler . It 's finally come here - to face judgement .  < nl > ProtagonistA smiled . ProtagonistB was so young .  And to about a third of the humans , ProtagonistB , not it , is hopebringer , Prophet , Hero . Who are we to pick sides ?  < nl >  * ProtagonistC * . 16,231,631 deaths . The highest kill count in human history that can be accounted to a single being , How can ProtagonistC possibly think-  < nl > ProtagonistA held up ProtagonistA's hand .  Enough . ProtagonistB comes . ProtagonistA will not have us break professionalism in front of a mortal .  < nl >  Professionalism , likely the only thing it cares about .  ProtagonistA turned to glare at it , but the blob was gone . ProtagonistA sighed . So young . < nl > In a cloud of white , ProtagonistB appeared in front of ProtagonistA's desk . ProtagonistB appeared in ProtagonistB's early 20s , most mortals did , as it was the age they felt they belonged most in . ProtagonistB wore a plain white robe which just served to highlight ProtagonistB's ebony hair ProtagonistB's emerald eyes widened as ProtagonistB puffed into existence , or well , non existence , depending on your perspective . But ProtagonistB collected ProtagonistB very soon . < nl >  Am ProtagonistB ... ?  < nl >  Dead , yes ,  ProtagonistA finished . < nl > ProtagonistB chewed on ProtagonistB's lip for a second , looked around , and then nodded .  ProtagonistB do n't appear to be being tortured , so ProtagonistB take it ProtagonistB 'm not in hell ?  < nl >  A bit early to jump to conclusions , ProtagonistB  < nl > ProtagonistB paled a bit at that and ProtagonistA bore on . < nl >  But regardless that 's not how we do things here . ProtagonistB must answer a riddle we pose to ProtagonistB , before Moving On ,  ProtagonistA said . < nl > ProtagonistB cocked ProtagonistB's head ,  pardon ProtagonistB , Moving On ? Am ProtagonistB not dead ?  ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistB's brow furrowed . < nl > To think ProtagonistB had killed millions . < nl >  Irrelevant ,  ProtagonistA said with a thump on the desk in front of ProtagonistA , that caused ProtagonistB to jump .  ProtagonistB's first focus is the riddle .  < nl >  ProtagonistB 'd imagine it 's not a knock knock joke ?  ProtagonistB said , somehow managing to smile . < nl > God help ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA liked ProtagonistB as ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA smiling back .  Riddles are assigned based on , ah , significance of your life actions .  < nl >  Significance ,  ProtagonistB said with a smirk ,  delicately put .  < nl > ProtagonistA's expression turned somber .  And so , as the representative of the first Afterlife , ProtagonistA present to ProtagonistB's riddle ,  ProtagonistA said , the line is spoken billions of times . < nl > ProtagonistB straightened up in ProtagonistB's seat , sensing the formality of the occasion . < nl >  ProtagonistA's riddle is ... Was it worth it ?  < nl >  What kind of question-  < nl > ProtagonistA held up ProtagonistA's hand .  That is for ProtagonistB to know .  < nl > The last thing ProtagonistA saw before leaving ProtagonistB alone in that room , was a look of utter , absolute terror . The kind that comes not when facing bullets , swords , assasins or demons , but the most dangerous demons of all - those on the inside : regret and self doubt . < nl > God help ProtagonistB . < nl > * * * < nl > If you enjoyed , check out [ XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com / r / XcessiveWriting/ ) for more of ProtagonistA's work < eos > 
< sos > The Grindons were a proud race that put a lot of emphasis on formality and , unlike Earthlings , they all looked practically identical . The Council had warned the landing party of Grindons to not be surprised by the diversity of the human race . Tall , short , thin , fat , ranging from white exo - coatings to black . Some were hairless and some were covered in hair from head to toe . < nl > So when ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's crew landed and offered their upper most appendage outwards for a  hand shake  , they made sure to offer the exact same gesture to every member of the welcoming party . ProtagonistB . < nl >  How do ProtagonistB do , ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA asked , appendage dangling in front of ProtagonistB's face . < nl >  Ruff !  ProtagonistB shouted , before enthusiastically licking ProtagonistA . < nl >  No , ProtagonistB ! No licking !  The president scolded .  Sorry about that , ProtagonistB gets excited .  < nl >  Have ProtagonistA offended ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA's hand shake ?  ProtagonistA asked , cradling ProtagonistA's wet appendage to ProtagonistA's chest . < nl >  No , that 's just something dogs do .  < nl >  Dogs ? As in canines ? We were informed that canines were predators .  < nl >  Well . Yes . But ProtagonistB is our dog . It 's different .  < nl > ProtagonistA's third ear quivered in confusion .  Why does ProtagonistB not attack ? Is that not it 's nature ?  < nl >  We care for ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB plays with us . Sometimes humans like to keep species that were previously predators in our houses with our families . We train them and call them pets .  < nl >  And you do this ... for pleasure ?  < nl >  Sometimes . Some of them are trained for work purposes , or taught to be guards .  < nl > Despite the Earthling president 's friendly nature , the Grindons made a hasty retreat . A race that welcomed predators into their homes and trained them to kill on command was a race to be feared . < nl > ProtagonistA continued on with ProtagonistA's global tour , but it seemed that all Earthlings were just as fearsome . < nl > In the land of Japan , the prime minister gently cradled a domesticated beast know as a cat . A member of ProtagonistA's crew saw it decapitate a harmless rodent . < nl > In Britain , the frail , elderly queen was followed by a whole pack of these dogs , all utterly devoted to even the weakest of the human species . < nl > The leader of Brazil had a pet that could fly away , and yet it returned on command . < nl > When the Grindons gave the Galactic Council their report , the senators refused to believe these tales . How could such a physically inferior race not only stop these predators from harming them , but train them to be willing captives ? It was unthinkable . < nl > But ProtagonistA knew . < nl > And ProtagonistA feared them . < nl > EDIT : car fixed to cat < eos > 
< sos > Three candles lit the room , their wicks barely burning above the pool of wax spilling out the candle holders . All three sat atop a rounded wood table set up for dinner . Two plates , two knives , two forks , but only one person . ProtagonistA waited as ProtagonistA always did as the flames began to flicker . < nl > ProtagonistB was n't coming . ProtagonistB never did , not since ProtagonistA was a little girl and they had made their promise . ProtagonistE coughed in the corner , hidden by ProtagonistA's shadow , as a dark liquid crept toward the dinner table . ProtagonistA let out a small breath and stepped out of the light , into the blood - stained cement floors of ProtagonistA's killing room . < nl >  Please , ProtagonistB have a family .  Every word came in a splutter of blood that speckled ProtagonistA's black silk dress .  There 's money in ProtagonistB's wallet if that 's what ProtagonistA want .  < nl > ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head .  ProtagonistA do n't want money .  < nl >  ProtagonistA 'll give ProtagonistB anything , just name it , but please do n't kill ProtagonistA .  < nl > Ironic since the only thing ProtagonistA wanted was ProtagonistB's life , though not as much as ProtagonistA's first victims . When ProtagonistA had first started killing , ProtagonistA had bought candles fresh from the store for every dinner , ProtagonistA had scrubbed the plates until they were spotless , and took care not to step in blood or have it splatter onto ProtagonistA's dress . Back then , ProtagonistA did n't let ProtagonistA's victims talk . It would 've ruined the atmosphere . < nl > But ProtagonistC could only be stood up so many times . The first five or so times , ProtagonistC got angry . By the time the candlelight died , ProtagonistC was hurling curses about broken promises and hearts . The victims had died long before ProtagonistA could take ProtagonistA's rage out on them . Now , at the fifteenth attempt , everything ProtagonistA did came half - hearted . ProtagonistA's candles were recycled from the previous night , ProtagonistA's dishes unwashed , and ProtagonistD still alive . ProtagonistD even had the strength to talk . < nl > ProtagonistA sighed .  Its fine ,  ProtagonistA said , tears in ProtagonistA's eyes ,  ProtagonistB 'll come next time .  ProtagonistA turned toward ProtagonistE .  Do n't worry , ProtagonistA wo n't let it hurt .  < nl > ProtagonistE let out a stuttered squeal as ProtagonistE pressed ProtagonistE further into the corner . < nl >  We 've both been hurt tonight ,  ProtagonistA muttered and grabbed a knife from the table . < nl > All of a sudden , ProtagonistE shot up and threw ProtagonistE's body against ProtagonistA . The blow knocked the breath from ProtagonistA's lungs and ProtagonistA's head whipped back into concrete . A single shrill note rang in ProtagonistA's ears as ProtagonistA blindly stabbed at ProtagonistE . < nl > Fingers wrapped around ProtagonistA's wrist , their nails like talons . And the knife was pried away . < nl >  ProtagonistA !  < nl > Fire sprouted from ProtagonistA's wrist and ProtagonistE rolled off ProtagonistA . ProtagonistE crashed through the rusted iron door of ProtagonistA's killing room . Sunlight spilled through the opening . ProtagonistA stared at ProtagonistA's open wrist , at the pool of blood crawling toward the sun . And then ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistF . ProtagonistA's breath caught . < nl >  ProtagonistF came back ,  ProtagonistA whispered . < nl >  Did n't ProtagonistF promise that ProtagonistF would ?  < nl > ProtagonistA pushed ProtagonistA up , swept off ProtagonistA's dress and took ProtagonistA's seat at the table .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said , a tremble in ProtagonistA's words .  ProtagonistA did n't think ProtagonistF 'd come so ProtagonistA had n't set up much . Here , ProtagonistF can take ProtagonistA's knife .  < nl > The other knife was on the ground , covered in ProtagonistA's blood . < nl > ProtagonistF stared back unmoving .  It 's a lovely dinner ,  ProtagonistF said . < nl > A small smile broke ProtagonistA's lips and tears welled up inside ProtagonistA's eyes .  Thank ProtagonistF .  ProtagonistA chuckled nervously and glanced up .  ProtagonistF 're not going to leave again , are ProtagonistF ?  < nl > ProtagonistF shook ProtagonistF's head .  No ,  ProtagonistF said .  Not this time .  < nl > ProtagonistA's smile stretched from cheek to cheek . Tears spilled down ProtagonistA's cheeks . And slowly , the candlelight faded until only darkness remained . < nl > --- < nl > --- < nl > /r / jraywang for 2 + stories a day , continuations by popular demand , and more ! < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA was thirteen when ProtagonistA first saw ProtagonistB .   It was a bombing .   A half dozen were killed instantly or near instantly , and twenty more wounded , including ProtagonistA .   As ProtagonistA lay there , bleeding amidst the wreckage , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB .   Tall and lank , black robes , black cloak , and a black hood obscuring ProtagonistB's build and features .   ProtagonistB wore a skull mask , but in the sockets ProtagonistA saw the twinkling of clear , dark , human eyes .   Long white fingers , bony , but not without skin , gripped the curved wooden shaft of a scythe .   A single sweep of it parted the souls from the six dead , and ProtagonistB gathered up the glowing energy like so much cut grass .   ProtagonistB moved about ProtagonistB's work with gentle grace . < nl > ProtagonistB was beautiful . < nl > For a brief moment , ProtagonistA's eyes met ProtagonistB .   ProtagonistB bowed ProtagonistB's head , and went about ProtagonistB's work , as though nothing had happened . < nl > Anyone else would have thought the encounter a hallucination , brought on by trauma and blood loss .   But ProtagonistA did n't .   ProtagonistA recovered , and carried that memory with ProtagonistA . < nl > -------------------- < nl > A year later , the two met again .   ProtagonistC had crushed a large spider ProtagonistC had found in ProtagonistC's room .   The act was willful , cold .   ProtagonistC did n't know if it was poisonous , but if it was , leaving it be was a risk , and trying to catch it a bigger one .   ProtagonistC took no chances . < nl > From behind ProtagonistC , a smooth voice spoke .  You know ,  it said slowly ,  ProtagonistC were supposed to die that night .    A bony arm in a black sleeve reached over ProtagonistC to pluck the spider 's soul from the ground like a flower . < nl > ProtagonistC turned around and met ProtagonistB's eyes again .    Why did ProtagonistB spare ProtagonistC , then ?  ProtagonistC asked . < nl >  ProtagonistC saw ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB replied .    Most can not .   ProtagonistC can see the things that other are unable or unwilling to , and that gives ProtagonistC power .   ProtagonistB thought to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB would let ProtagonistC live .   There would be no harm in it .  < nl >  ProtagonistB 're a good person ,  ProtagonistC said , clasping ProtagonistB's hands .    Thank ProtagonistB .  < nl > ProtagonistB clasped back , and said ,  ProtagonistB appreciate the sentiment , but mine is thankless work , and ProtagonistB must be getting back to it .   There are people in pain who need release from their broken mortal shells .   ProtagonistB must tend to them .  < nl > ProtagonistB stood , and strode to the doorway .    Will ProtagonistC see ProtagonistB again ?  ProtagonistC asked , as ProtagonistB left .   The hood tilted forward , then back again .    In good time .   All must meet ProtagonistB sooner or later .   Be patient , ProtagonistC .   ProtagonistB will be waiting for ProtagonistC .   Do not waste ProtagonistB's gift of life .   ProtagonistB do not offer second chances often .    ProtagonistC moved to follow , but when ProtagonistC ducked out ProtagonistC's bedroom door , ProtagonistB was already gone . < nl > -------- < nl > ProtagonistC stood in ProtagonistC's back yard , in a pathway of pebbles .   ProtagonistC picked them up , one at a time , running ProtagonistC's fingers over them and tossing them experimentally upwards .   Finally , ProtagonistC found a smooth , elliptical one that satisfied ProtagonistC . < nl > ProtagonistC's eyes darted around , scanning the trees , settling on a squirrel at the base of one .   The two stared at each other , neither daring to move .   Then ProtagonistC flicked the pebble at it .   It hit its mark , stunning the small creature .   ProtagonistC ran over it , not taking time to rise fully and instead clambering forward with ProtagonistC's arms for support .   ProtagonistC reached the squirrel just as it stirred , grabbed it by the body , and twisted its head a full 180 degrees .   And ProtagonistC kept twisting . < nl > ProtagonistB rested a thin , pale hand on ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistC stopped , looking abruptly into ProtagonistB's eyes again .   ProtagonistB did not look back .   ProtagonistB's eyes instead focused on the cooling corpse ProtagonistC held .    Such small things ,  ProtagonistB said ,  tend to mind their own business .   It is a pity to cut a short life shorter .   ProtagonistB 'd ask why , but ProtagonistB know .  < nl >  ProtagonistC wanted to see ProtagonistB again ,  ProtagonistC said , ignoring ProtagonistB's speech .    ProtagonistC 'd give anything .  < nl >  Then why not ProtagonistC's own life , instead of this one ,  ProtagonistB said , and ProtagonistB's words were harsh and cold as ice . < nl > ProtagonistC flinched , and ProtagonistC looked away , before whispering ,  ProtagonistB told ProtagonistC not to waste ProtagonistC's life .  < nl >  All lives are precious ,  ProtagonistB began ,  and ProtagonistB ought to know .   After all , ProtagonistB am the one who must see every life end .   Do not continue this method of summoning ProtagonistB .   If nothing else , for ProtagonistB's sake .   ProtagonistB so hate ProtagonistB's work .  < nl > Then ProtagonistB took the squirrel 's soul , and was gone .   ProtagonistC looked down at the dead rodent , tore its head off , and left it to rot . < nl > ------- < nl > ProtagonistC was 16 when ProtagonistC killed again .   This time it was a human .   ProtagonistC did n't know who it was , did n't care .   All ProtagonistC knew was that ProtagonistC loved death , and wanted desperately to see ProtagonistB again . < nl > This time , however , ProtagonistB was not gentle with ProtagonistC .   ProtagonistB pushed ProtagonistC aside with ProtagonistB's hand , and hard .   Then ProtagonistB tended to the one ProtagonistC had killed . < nl >  ProtagonistB was a painter ,  ProtagonistB said ,  not the best , but ProtagonistB had passion , and some skill .   ProtagonistB was working on a new one , as a present for ProtagonistD , but ProtagonistB ran out of paint .   So , ProtagonistB ran out to get more .   But ProtagonistC got to ProtagonistB first .   Now that painting will remain unfinished , and ProtagonistD will be alone .    ProtagonistB reached for the young man 's hand , and hauled a spectre to its feet .    Come along ,  ProtagonistB said to the ghostly outline ,  ProtagonistB ought to let you see ProtagonistD one last time , even if ProtagonistD can not see you .    And the two walked away , hand in hand , past ProtagonistC , ignoring ProtagonistC . < nl > ----------------- < nl > ProtagonistC peered around from behind the wall , watching the still body as though it would come to life .   ProtagonistC was waiting for ProtagonistB again , to confront ProtagonistB .   ProtagonistB had ignored ProtagonistC for the past several kills . < nl > ProtagonistB came , as ProtagonistB always did , and set to claiming the soul .    ProtagonistB know ProtagonistC 're there ,  ProtagonistB said , as ProtagonistB looked over the latest victim ,  ProtagonistB 'd recognize ProtagonistC's cruel knifework anywhere .   Come out .   ProtagonistB must speak to ProtagonistC .  < nl > ProtagonistC stepped out into the light , wearing a flowing black dress and long , white gloves , both unusually clean for the amount of blood ProtagonistC had spilled .    ProtagonistC 've missed ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistC said ,  and our talks .  < nl >  ProtagonistB said ProtagonistB wanted to speak to ProtagonistC , not with ProtagonistC .   Be silent ,  ProtagonistB shot back , never looking up .   ProtagonistC pouted even though ProtagonistC knew ProtagonistB was n't watching .    ProtagonistB told ProtagonistC not to waste ProtagonistC's life .   Now ProtagonistC have thrown it away , become a criminal .   Murderer .   ProtagonistC could see past the veil .   With that power , ProtagonistC could have done much good .   Helped people gain closure .   Warned people of danger .   Instead ProtagonistC chose this life .  < nl >  ProtagonistB spared ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistC began .    No , ProtagonistB saved ProtagonistC !   ProtagonistC should have died .   ProtagonistC love ProtagonistB .  < nl >  ProtagonistB did no such thing ,  ProtagonistB spat ,  In the confusion ProtagonistB must have overlooked ProtagonistC .   It was a mistake .   In more ways than one now , ProtagonistB see .  < nl >  But ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistC , looked into ProtagonistC's eyes ,  ProtagonistC protested ,  ProtagonistB nodded to ProtagonistC .  < nl >  Blood loss and trauma make people see things that were not .   Now , if ProtagonistC have any respect , or love for ProtagonistB , ProtagonistC will stop this madness .   Now , ProtagonistB take ProtagonistB's leave .  < nl > ProtagonistB vanished , taking the soul ProtagonistB had come to claim with ProtagonistB . < nl > ----------------------- < nl > ProtagonistC , burned and bleeding , lay there , much as ProtagonistC had when ProtagonistC first met ProtagonistB .   ProtagonistC had always known ProtagonistC would slip up one day , and today had been it .   Murder , then arson to cover ProtagonistC's tracks .   That had been the plan .   But ProtagonistE had escaped the building , and called the police and fire departments .   ProtagonistC , meanwhile , had gotten delayed , and by the time ProtagonistC extricated ProtagonistC from the rubble , they were waiting .   ProtagonistC was already burned and bruised .   The smart thing to do would have been to go quietly .   But ProtagonistC did n't .   Maybe , ProtagonistC had thought , if ProtagonistC die here , we can finally be together . < nl > So ProtagonistC charged at them , knife raised , and they opened fire . < nl > Now ProtagonistC could only watch as the ambulance dragged away ProtagonistE , and Death was not coming for ProtagonistE .   Not yet , at least . < nl > Then , a black spot emerged from the flames and illuminated smoke , and ProtagonistB strode from the building , carrying a bundle of souls , and supporting ProtagonistF .   ProtagonistB let ProtagonistF fall on the grass , and the EMTs came for ProtagonistF . < nl > Meanwhile , ProtagonistB came for ProtagonistC .    Is it ProtagonistC's time ?  ProtagonistC gasped . < nl >  No ,  ProtagonistB said .    ProtagonistB am taking no more souls tonight .   ProtagonistF ,  ProtagonistB pointed at ProtagonistF ,  will live .   ProtagonistE will live .   The firefighters will live .   Anyone who was not already dead or too mangled to save when ProtagonistB entered the building will live .   And ProtagonistC will live .  < nl >  Please ,  ProtagonistC choked out ,  take ProtagonistC .   Take ProtagonistC with ProtagonistB .  < nl >  ProtagonistB will not .   ProtagonistB told ProtagonistC once before , ProtagonistB do not give second chances often .   ProtagonistC will live .   The courts will convict ProtagonistC .   ProtagonistC will be sentenced to life in prison .   Which , for ProtagonistC , will be a very , very long time .   ProtagonistC will not be able to kill again .   ProtagonistC will not see ProtagonistB again .   ProtagonistB will not come for ProtagonistC , now or ever .   When old age takes ProtagonistC , ProtagonistC will be left as a soul trapped in a dead , lifeless shell .   And ProtagonistC will never know peace .  < nl > ProtagonistC screamed , and drew ProtagonistC's spare knife before plunging it through ProtagonistC's own heart .   ProtagonistC let out a gurgling breath as blood that should have circulated through ProtagonistC's lungs began to fill them . < nl >  ProtagonistC will recover ,  ProtagonistB said .    ProtagonistC are only making this harder on ProtagonistC .   ProtagonistC know , with ProtagonistC's eyes , ProtagonistC could have helped many , instead of harmed them .   Saved them , instead of killed them .   ProtagonistC could have passed ProtagonistB's gift of life on .   But ProtagonistC did n't .   And I.  ProtagonistB paused , and inched closer .    Hate .  Closer still .    ProtagonistC .  ProtagonistB whispered into ProtagonistC's ear .   And then ProtagonistB was gone .   ProtagonistC never saw ProtagonistB again . < nl > ------------------ < nl > EDIT :   Thanks for the gold , ProtagonistB !   Never been gilded before , let alone on one of my stories .   This made my evening . < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA had been sixteen when ProtagonistA first saw ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had planted a cold kiss on ProtagonistA's mother 's colorless lips after ProtagonistB's work was completed . And tonight ProtagonistA would see ProtagonistB again , as ProtagonistA had once a month for the past two years . ProtagonistA always chose the night of the full moon . It felt more romantic that way , since the moon had been round and full that fateful night . And the silver beams illuminating the room offered a certain ambience . < nl >  ProtagonistA 're a real artist , ProtagonistA . Truly .  ProtagonistB's familiar voice rasped from behind ProtagonistA . A voice like crackling , burning flames . A smile pulled at ProtagonistA's lips as ProtagonistA turned to face ProtagonistB , the knife held in ProtagonistA's calm , idle hands . A paintbrush used to create ProtagonistA's masterpieces . The crimson paint of ProtagonistA's most recent victim still coated the silver blade . < nl >  I was starting to worry ProtagonistB would not show ,  ProtagonistA said , batting ProtagonistA's long , pale lashes against ProtagonistA's cheeks .  Do ProtagonistB like it ?  ProtagonistA asked hopefully , motioning to the motel bed behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB peek around ProtagonistA , unflinching as ProtagonistB's black eyes took in the flayed man laid spread eagle on the mattress . < nl >  Impressive . But then , it is easy for ProtagonistA to lure them in , is n't it ? They see a lovely thing like ProtagonistA and abandon all sense ,  ProtagonistB replied . < nl > ProtagonistA frowned and crossed ProtagonistA's arms over ProtagonistA's chest .  Because ProtagonistA am a woman ProtagonistA have an easier time of it ?  ProtagonistA asked , annoyed .  Some of them become suspicious . And ProtagonistB should see the look on their faces when they see the knife ,  ProtagonistA smiled , hazel eyes sparking at the memory . < nl > ProtagonistB smiled ProtagonistB's cool , alluring smile .  I 'm sure ProtagonistB's face was a mask of terror ,  ProtagonistB said , plucking ProtagonistA's weapon from ProtagonistA's hand and setting it aside .  Come here .  < nl > ProtagonistA's body instantly reacted to ProtagonistB's command and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in ProtagonistB's lithe arms . ProtagonistA knew morning would come too fast , as it always did . But for now ProtagonistA was content to indulge in life 's small pleasures . Plus there was always next month to look forward to . < nl > ProtagonistA awoke to the sunlight filtering in through the dusty blinds , warming ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA stirred among the comforter splayed out on the hard , dirty carpet that smelled faintly of mildew and piss . It was worth it , though . ProtagonistA sighed and sat up , hoping ProtagonistB was still there , though ProtagonistA hoped in vain as usual . ProtagonistA sprang to ProtagonistA's feet and donned ProtagonistA's sweater and jeans , ignoring the body drying out on the mattress . There was still time to take care of that . < nl > Biting ProtagonistA's lip , ProtagonistA padded across the room to the nightstand and plucked up the note that lay there , ProtagonistA's eyes drinking in the familiar scrawling handwriting : < nl >  ProtagonistA , < nl > The nights we share have been a favorite part of ProtagonistB's routine for some time now . The warmth ProtagonistB find in ProtagonistA's arms has been an unfamiliar solace , one ProtagonistB have come to treasure . Until our next rendezvous , ProtagonistB shall think of ProtagonistA's iridescent eyes , alight with the same passion that stirs ProtagonistB's own blood . ProtagonistB shall see ProtagonistA again when next the moon reaches its most stunning phase . < nl > Yours- < nl > G.R. < nl > P.S. ProtagonistB left a gift for ProtagonistA outside .  < nl > ProtagonistA smiled and set the note down , ProtagonistA's heart jumping in ProtagonistA's chest , curious to see what ProtagonistB had left ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA hurried to the window and glanced out . There , hanging from the corner stoplight , was ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC's bloody entrails were hanging free and ProtagonistC's ragged skin flapped in the summer breeze . ProtagonistB was such a romantic , ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB knew the way straight to ProtagonistA's heart , and it certainly was n't flowers . < nl > -------------------------------------------- < nl > Edit : to add this - r / PhantomFiction , should anyone wish to peek further into me brain . :) < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA was disappointed , of course , but ProtagonistA was also a practical man , so ProtagonistA dispensed with grumbling and instead got to work . ProtagonistA began with the bottles first , then the scraps of food strewn about , then the shredded photographs laying across the floor like pixellated snow . < nl > Finally , after ProtagonistA had squeezed the trash bag down the chute , ProtagonistA returned to pick ProtagonistB off the ground , then began the slow trudge to the bedroom . < nl >  ProtagonistB 'm OK ... ProtagonistB can ... walk by ProtagonistB ...  < nl >  ProtagonistB promised ProtagonistA ProtagonistB would n't drink again , ProtagonistB .  < nl >  Did ProtagonistB ? ProtagonistB did n't ...  < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm here anytime , ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB should talk to ProtagonistA , not bottle it all up .  < nl > ProtagonistB was quiet for a while , until ProtagonistB's head hit the pillows . ProtagonistB still stank of old sweat , alcohol , depression . ProtagonistA was turning to leave when ProtagonistB's hand shot out , caught ProtagonistA . < nl >  ProtagonistB 'm sorry , it 's just that ... ProtagonistB know ProtagonistB promised ProtagonistA ProtagonistB would move on , but ProtagonistB ... ProtagonistB miss ProtagonistC so much sometimes , ProtagonistA know ?  < nl >  Yeah , OK .  < nl >  Oh no , oh no ... ProtagonistB 've made ProtagonistA angry , have n't ProtagonistB ? ProtagonistB 've gone and done it again ... ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB swear , ProtagonistB really do like ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB want to be with ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistB want to move on ...  < nl >  Then what 's stopping ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB ? Have ProtagonistB been calling ProtagonistC again ?  < nl > ProtagonistA did n't really understand what triggered those black episodes ProtagonistB lost ProtagonistB in . ProtagonistA thought at first that they were still communicating over the Internet , or through phone messages . But there were none . And as far as ProtagonistA could tell , from the first day ProtagonistA had reached out to ProtagonistB , performed first aid on ProtagonistB while the emergency services arrived , ProtagonistA had never seen ProtagonistC , only heard ProtagonistB's talk about ProtagonistC in the abstract . < nl > But ProtagonistA had noticed that tragedies tended to precipitate such moods . If they witnessed an accident , saw people perish , ProtagonistB would spiral again , uncontrollably . < nl > Perhaps it was some kind of PTSD . < nl >  ProtagonistB swear , ProtagonistB 've not been calling ProtagonistC . It 's just that ... ProtagonistB 'm reminded of ProtagonistC at times , ProtagonistA know ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA know . And ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA do n't care about ProtagonistB's past . ProtagonistA 'm here to help ProtagonistB through this . But ProtagonistB have to want to help ProtagonistB too , ProtagonistA ca n't do it alone .  < nl > ProtagonistB sat up suddenly , a flame igniting in ProtagonistB's eyes , a certain clarity which shone through . < nl >  No , this can not go on . ProtagonistB was wrong . ProtagonistB have to accept that ProtagonistB ca n't change who ProtagonistB am . Please , ProtagonistA , please go . ProtagonistB ca n't promise ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB 'll ever move on . And if ProtagonistB ever weaken again , feel like seeing ProtagonistC again ... ProtagonistA may get hurt , ProtagonistA . So please , we have to end this .  < nl > ProtagonistA expected the words , but they still cut deep . How many times had ProtagonistA tried to move on ProtagonistA ? But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had to try , to see if ProtagonistA could ever walk with ProtagonistB to the end of the tunnel - there , surely , there would be enough light for the two of them . < nl >  ProtagonistA 'll stay with ProtagonistB until ProtagonistA die , ProtagonistA promise ,  ProtagonistA said , running ProtagonistA's fingers through ProtagonistB's hair as ProtagonistA coaxed ProtagonistB back to sleep . < nl >  That 's ... what ProtagonistB 'm afraid of ...  ProtagonistB replied , as ProtagonistB slowly drifted off to sleep . < nl > ProtagonistA kissed ProtagonistB on the forehead , drew the blanket over ProtagonistB , then left . < nl > --- < nl > /r / rarelyfunny < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA leaned over ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA took ProtagonistB's hand in ProtagonistA's own and brought it to ProtagonistA's mouth , kissing it softly .  ProtagonistA do n't want ProtagonistB to go ,  ProtagonistA said , as warm tears ran down well worn passages . The heart - rate monitor beeped in a slow staccato that echoed forlornly around the room . Their bedroom had been turned into a hospital ward . The smell was no longer that of laundry and sex and perfume , but bleach and urine and despair . < nl > ProtagonistB forced ProtagonistB's eyes open and tried desperately to smile - to reassure ProtagonistA - but only a hint of one formed on ProtagonistB's lips . ProtagonistA remembered how ProtagonistB used to smile , when they were younger . How ProtagonistB's freckles would shift as ProtagonistB did so , like grains of sand dancing in the breeze . ProtagonistB's eyes now listless and dim , once a daring , dancing sea - foam green . < nl >  ProtagonistA 'll be okay , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB whispered .  ProtagonistA always were the stronger of us .  < nl >  No ,  ProtagonistA said . The tears became a salty tributary , trickling into ProtagonistA's mouth .  ProtagonistA was only strong because ProtagonistA had * ProtagonistB * to make ProtagonistA strong . We got through it all together .  < nl > ProtagonistB did n't reply . Or could n't . ProtagonistA was n't sure . ProtagonistA gently lay ProtagonistA's head down onto ProtagonistB's chest as ProtagonistA wept , avoiding the mishmash of drips and wires that needled into ProtagonistB's body . The cross that hung around ProtagonistA's neck dangled over ProtagonistB's belly . ProtagonistA clasped the tiny metal in a single hand and said a silent prayer . ProtagonistA squeezed the cross tightly as ProtagonistA did so , until the metal bit deep into ProtagonistA's skin . < nl > The tempo of the heart - rate monitor slowed to a crawling adagio . < nl >  I get ...  ProtagonistB gasped ,  to die at home . With dignity . With ProtagonistA . For that ProtagonistB 'm grateful .  < nl > ProtagonistB's eyes fell shut . < nl >  ProtagonistB love ...  ProtagonistB whispered . < nl > ProtagonistB's chest stopped beating . < nl > ProtagonistA wept , ProtagonistA's head still resting on ProtagonistB . < nl > * * It * * refused to watch on impotently any longer . < nl > ProtagonistA did n't see the tiny machines enter ProtagonistB's body . They were everywhere - omnipresent , almost - although much too small to be noticed . ProtagonistA did n't see what they did to ProtagonistB's organs , or how they crushed the cancer that had all but eaten ProtagonistB . How they repaired the damage . < nl > * It * did n't even understand why it had done it , not fully . It had seen billions of them die before , without anything close to an emotion being born of it . After all , that was nature . That was humanity , and their great flaw . No , it was n't sure why this had happened . < nl > Exhaustion had taken ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA slept long , not noticing when ProtagonistB's chest began bobbing gently up and down , beneath ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA did n't notice the hand as it softly stroked ProtagonistA's hair , but ProtagonistA moaned happily as it did . < nl > When ProtagonistA woke , they hugged , and kissed and made a thousand promises . Then ProtagonistA held the cross in ProtagonistA's hands and said a thousand * thank you 's * . < nl > If it could have smiled , it thought it might have done so . < nl > --- < nl > If you liked this , you can find more of my stories on /r / nickofnight < eos >

Sit on the hood of ProtagonistA's car when you know ProtagonistA 's working . Go to the restaurant and order a refill of coffee every 15 minutes so ProtagonistA has to interact with you . < nl > They say distance makes the heart grow stronger , but who ever  they  are , is full of shit . < nl > If you followed these steps properly , you 're either in bed with ProtagonistA , or you 're in prison . Stay tuned for our next REAL guide , How REAL Men(tm ) Survive Prison ! < eos > 
< sos > Worthless , that was what you told ProtagonistA . Stupid and worthless , a waste of potential and a disappointment . Such cruel words for someone as young as I. For ProtagonistA was but a nine - year - old child whose mind was still fresh with delusions of heroism and dreams of following in the footsteps of ProtagonistA's parents . You remember Sileman ? ProtagonistB ? Solid objects , immaterial objects , did n't matter what it was , ProtagonistB 'd slip through it effortlessly and harmlessly . Heck , ProtagonistB could even turn ProtagonistB invisible at will by slipping through the light spectrum just so . Yes , ProtagonistD . < nl > And ProtagonistC , if you can call ProtagonistC as such . ProtagonistC Stone the Rockman ProtagonistC called ProtagonistC ( an idiotic name to be certain , but then most of you heroes are n't known for your creativity ) . ProtagonistC could make ProtagonistC's flesh turn into some kind of weird super - dense material that science is still trying to figure out what it was made of . When ProtagonistC first met ProtagonistD , it had been when you - ProtagonistA - had holed up in the National Bank near downtown about ninteeen years ago- oh but you remember , do n't you ? What should have been a run - of - the - mill bank heist gone horribly wrong that led to the death of 3 heroes and 2 villains . ProtagonistD would have made hero number four if not for the bumbling antics of ProtagonistC rushing in to save the day . < nl >  ProtagonistA do n't really * cough * give a damn about your * wheeze * life story ...  < nl > Oh , but you do - you played such a critical role that ProtagonistA think a lesson in emotional damage is exactly what you should - as you put it - ' give a damn about ' . Oh , careful , that wire you 're holding onto is n't nearly as strong now that it 's frayed at this end , and one little bump might just send this entire scaffold plummeting to the concrete death below . While ProtagonistA 'm sure you would survive , ProtagonistA ca n't imagine you can vouch for all those little kiddies at the other end . < nl >  Do n't hurt them ! * grunt *   Just .. let them go ..  < nl > Rude ! One more interruption like that and ProtagonistA's fingers might just slip ! Oh , but as ProtagonistA was saying ... yes , ProtagonistC managed to rescue ProtagonistD just as you lost control of your powers and went critical , detonating the bank and the two buildings next door . You , who should have died on the spot , if not for that altruistic neanderthal protecting your naked form . You , who should have slipped into a coma to never come back had ProtagonistD not phased into your brain , guided by the directions of the hospital 's neurosurgeon . It was under their watchful eye that you were given a new chance , a new lease on life . < nl > Yet instead of making the most of it , you squandered that precious gift . You wasted it , on taunting and teasing the one thing that mattered most to them - ProtagonistA . From the moment ProtagonistA was born , you resented what ProtagonistA represented - a perfect union of superpowers that was destined for greatness . And so you mocked ProtagonistA . You turned everyone against ProtagonistA , you convinced ProtagonistA's parents that ProtagonistA's power was so worthless that ProtagonistA should be examined by ' experts of mental retardation ' to explore if there was any way ProtagonistA might lead a more than average life . You betrayed ProtagonistA's trust , you destroyed ProtagonistA's belief in everything ProtagonistA had held dear . < nl >  We were .. trying to help ... ugh ... blood loss .. dizzy ...  < nl > Help ProtagonistA ? You stole ProtagonistA's future from ProtagonistA ! You told ProtagonistA that everything ProtagonistA 'd ever dreamed of , everything ProtagonistA 'd ever wanted , was a lie ! Your revisionist history on what you think to be true blinds your thoughts even now ! Even now , at death 's door , bleeding out from a mortal wound that -I- inflicted on you ! ProtagonistA That same worthless trash you said would never amount to anything , now taking from you everything you took from ProtagonistA - LIFE ITSELF ! < nl >  D - damn it ... you ... are better than .. this ...  < nl > Do you feel ProtagonistA's foot on your waistline ? Do you feel the weight of ProtagonistA's anguish crushing your security belt , destroying those precious electronic gizmos that always kept your powers in check should they ever run amok again ? Can you hear the sound of those children screaming even as ProtagonistA shift ProtagonistA's weight just a little bit more to tip them closer to their doom ? And yet here you lay - pitiful , worthless , helpless . If ProtagonistA were a betting man , ProtagonistA 'd guess you have about one minute of consciousness left . ProtagonistA can only imagine what your powers will do unchecked after that . < nl >  It does n't have to be like this ... still time ... change ... good ...  < nl > No , ProtagonistA's dear sister , your time is up . This little chat has been highly therapeutic . Perhaps in the next life you will think twice before rushing in to save people you have no business saving . But there is no heaven for you . Feel free to enjoy the screams of anguish from all those families you just destroyed , parents cursing your name for failing to do the one thing you should have done from the start . The one thing that might have changed your history , and ProtagonistA . For failing to save the one person in this world that needed saving more than anyone else . But it 's too late now . < nl >  No ! ProtagonistA can't--  < nl > But ProtagonistA already have . Goodbye , sister . < nl > ---- < nl >  A terrible tragedy at City Square tonight . A field trip that ended in a nightmare for the families involved . Twenty - seven children and one female adult died today during their visit to the newly - constructed Skyway Tower when an explosion destroyed the observation deck sending it hurtling to the pavement below . Police have identified one of the adult female bodies as the hero Fyrefrost . One student 's phone captured this video moments before .  < nl > ProtagonistE gritted ProtagonistE's teeth angrily as the council sat in silence , watching the report on the massively oversized screen . There was no mistaking the familiar fiery red hair of ProtagonistD as ProtagonistD faced off against a strange man in a brown trenchcoat and a brown fedora , wearing dark sunglasses . The video shook for a moment as it flipped to the student 's face giving a thumbs - up to the camera before shakily flipping back to the scene . ProtagonistD's voice cheerfully called out to the camera .  Check this out , ProtagonistE ! It 's that hero , Fyrefrost , about to take out a bad guy !  < nl >  ProtagonistE do n't know what your problem is pal , but ProtagonistE 'm not going to let you get anywhere near those kids !  ProtagonistA's voice was full of controlled rage as the video seemed to cut out right at the end of ProtagonistA's declaration . With a loud buzz the camera flipped on , now staring just behind a pair of leather boots at ProtagonistA , impaled on a large metal rod that was sticking straight up through ProtagonistA's chest and out ProtagonistA's back . ProtagonistA was clutching ProtagonistA's side as blood poured out from under ProtagonistA leaving ProtagonistA in a growing pool of blood . The sound of delightful laughter from somewhere above those feet chilled ProtagonistE to the bone , even as the tears sprung to ProtagonistE's eyes . < nl >  Ah , ah ! ProtagonistE would say watch that first step , ProtagonistA , but it seems ProtagonistA 're just as clumsy as ever . ProtagonistE wonder what mother and father would say if they could see us now . Oh , but they will see us soon--  < nl >  Shut it off . That 's enough .  ProtagonistF growled angrily , fists trembling visibly as ProtagonistF barely held on .  That 's more than enough .  < nl >  How ... ? How could this- ?  ProtagonistE's voice choked off as ProtagonistE broke down into sobs . One of the newer heroes with a gold star on his chest tried to reach out to ProtagonistE but ProtagonistF slapped his hand away angrily . < nl >  It would seem ,  stated ProtagonistF ,  that ProtagonistA's power is n't so useless after all .  < nl >  Declare it . Declare it now , and be done with it , ProtagonistF .  ProtagonistF's voice was colder than it had ever been . < nl >  The Tripper , master of invisible rocks , is hereby declared a G1 Villain . A true menace that must be dealt with swiftly .  ProtagonistF folded ProtagonistF's arms over ProtagonistF's chest . G1 Villains were rare , the worst of the worst - a designation reserved for only those who had proven themselves beyond dangerous and had killed a hero in action . The group of heroes bowed their head in silence as ProtagonistE's cries rose into terrorized screams that made them all feel very ill . ProtagonistF rose to ProtagonistF's feet and quietly made ProtagonistF's way out to the opposite end of the large meeting hall . < nl > Somewhere , the Tripper laughed maniacally as the gears of his ultimate plan began to turn . < nl > ---- < nl > Edit : Woah , this exploded overnight ! Fixed a typo . By popular request ProtagonistA 'll work on a part 2 after work ,   likely posted same time this one was .

< sos > ProtagonistA glanced up and gave me a genuine smile , a smile that sent shivers down my spine . If I had n't known I was sitting on the other side of the table from ProtagonistA , it would have been a nice smile to look at and have offered to you . ProtagonistA * was * also undeniably very attractive as well ; that 's part of what had taken us so long to finally pin ProtagonistA down . < nl > We 'd been looking for a hag until ProtagonistA had finally been caught red handed , not a near supermodel . < nl >  I have to ask .  I cocked an eyebrow , ProtagonistA glancing up at me and nodding expectantly .  How have ProtagonistA fooled ProtagonistA's body like ProtagonistA have ?  < nl > ProtagonistA tilted ProtagonistA's head and an almost bemused smirk crossed ProtagonistA's face before ProtagonistA replied .  Oh , yes . You mean the outer beauty , right ? The fact that ProtagonistA 'm not hideous after all the atrocities ProtagonistA 've committed ?  < nl >  Yes . Obviously .  I sipped on my now lukewarm coffee , waiting for ProtagonistA's reply . Normally , our job was easy as police- an ugly soul always manifested outwardly into an ugly body , and the worse the crimes , the quicker the body degraded , but depravity always showed itself in the end . The room filled with an uncomfortable silence that settled in for several seconds before ProtagonistA finally replied . < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm not sure you 'd believe ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA told you .  ProtagonistA cleared ProtagonistA's throat and stared right into my eyes .  But ProtagonistA 'm sure you can figure it out if ProtagonistA tell you to start digging into the backgrounds of the people ProtagonistA 've killed . * Really * dig .  < nl > We * had * noticed that some of ProtagonistA's victims were in various states of bodily decay , as we liked to call it , but most of them had looked like normal , good people that you 'd wave to if you came across them on the street . I frowned and returned ProtagonistA's gaze .  I will give ProtagonistA that a few of them had started to degenerate-  < nl >  It 's the ones that * did n't * start to degenerate that should concern you , Officer Milson .  ProtagonistA's hazel eyes were boring into my soul .  The ones that did n't * believe * that what they were doing was wrong or bad .  ProtagonistA frowned and shook ProtagonistA's head .  ProtagonistA have not changed , ProtagonistA believe , because ProtagonistA killed those ugly on the * inside * that managed to avoid the consequences of their actions- those that deserved it .  < nl >  But ... how did they not change , either ?  < nl >  Because in * their * minds , they did no wrong .  < eos > 
< sos > When the door slammed shut , ProtagonistA began to speak as quickly as ProtagonistA could .    You never knew ProtagonistA was an actress ?  ProtagonistA asked , totally in denial .    ProtagonistA mean , ProtagonistA told you ProtagonistA had a film shoot the other day !   Did that not tip you off ?    ProtagonistA's radiant smile was clouded with a brow of confusion . < nl >  ProtagonistA said ProtagonistA were a film major !   I did n't think to question ProtagonistA's motives ProtagonistA ...    I responded , trying my best to placate ProtagonistA .   I know we 'd been dating for a few months , but evidently there was stuff we did n't communicate . < nl >  And what about ProtagonistB ?   No clue , not a single blessed clue ?  ProtagonistA responded , putting ProtagonistA's purse down , ProtagonistA's dress shimmering in the bitter light of the dining room . < nl >  I thought ProtagonistB was a college friend .   I mean , ProtagonistB looks like a stoner !  I respond , ProtagonistA pausing in ProtagonistA's steps a moment .    Okay , you get that one .   We did meet in college , but ProtagonistB 's also ProtagonistA's manager .  < nl > ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's heels and threw them across the room , hitting the wall with a clatter .   Up above us , ProtagonistC stomped ProtagonistC's feet , a muffled warning to keep it down coming through the carpet . < nl > ProtagonistA seemed on the verge of crying , sitting down in the chair closest , cradling ProtagonistA's head in ProtagonistA's arms . < nl >  So , you wanted to date ProtagonistA , never knowing ProtagonistA was rich , or famous , or even talented ?  < nl > I grabbed the chair next to ProtagonistA , spun it around , tossing my admittedly ragged tie across the room . < nl >  I thought ProtagonistA were nice , and seemed down .   I just wanted to make ProtagonistA happy .  I said , pulling ProtagonistA into my arms . < nl >  You have ...  ProtagonistA said , and we spent the evening together , not as celebrity and sidekick boyfriend , but as the happy couple in the apartment downstairs . < nl > _ _ _ _ _ < nl > EDIT : A word < eos > 
< sos > Skywalker 12 ground to a halt , creaking and spilling vapor from a trio of punctured arteries . A quintet of segmented pincers grappled furiously with the wobbly stalks of the blackish - green treetops . < nl >  pO2 plummeting !  shouted ProtagonistA , helplessly typing out commands that the carrier craft could no longer obey .  Bunker shields are torn in multiple areas . O2 differentiation is dropping - it hit a canister , ProtagonistA think .  < nl >  It hit * all * the canisters ,  sniped ProtagonistD from the other side of the command console .  None of us can survive this kind of rapid pressure drop , ProtagonistB . We 're already over a 1,000 meters above the DZ threshold .  < nl >  We 're not going to die ,  said ProtagonistB . From ProtagonistB's vantage point , ProtagonistB could just see one of the severed claws protruding from the Skywalker 's flank . * What the hell had that thing even been ? *  Can we move ?  < nl >  It 's too dense to descend ,  said ProtagonistA , shaking ProtagonistA's head .  We lost functionality on the front cutters in the battle .  < nl >  Forward , then ?  pressed ProtagonistB . < nl >  Forward * where * ?  growled ProtagonistC , from ProtagonistC's strapped down bucket seat on the periphery of the command deck .  The Sea goes on for thousands of kilometers in every direction .  < nl >  Forward is the only option we have ,  replied ProtagonistB , cold and calm .  Return to course .  < nl > ProtagonistA nodded ProtagonistA's head .  Automatic 's down , too , though .  ProtagonistD rolled ProtagonistD's eyes , hard - switching over to manual piloting and pushing the spider - like tree crawler forward on a north - northeastward track . < nl >  We were n't prepared for that ,  said ProtagonistB , standing in front of ProtagonistC .  What was that ?  < nl > ProtagonistC smiled , though ProtagonistC's face was still gray and slick with sweat .  ProtagonistB know full well , ProtagonistB . This is uncharted territory . No one 's ever been this deep into the Sea of Trees . Satellite imagery can only tell us so much .  < nl > ProtagonistB opened ProtagonistB's mouth to reply , but stumbled , falling hard to ProtagonistB's knees . ProtagonistB's head swam . < nl >  pO2 's still dropping , ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's face pale , ProtagonistA's hands unsteady .  ProtagonistB should probably stay down . In a little while we wo n't be able ... to ...  ProtagonistA lost ProtagonistA's breath . < nl >  Faster , please ,  wheezed ProtagonistB . < nl > ProtagonistD did n't have the air or the energy to smirk or respond . The Skywalker pressed on . < nl >  ProtagonistB had to suspect , though ,  said ProtagonistC , head lolling slightly to the side .  These mountainous trees . This dense , imperceptible world . * Something * strange and horrible had to live here . Something godlike .  < nl > ProtagonistB glared up at ProtagonistC , but said nothing . < nl >  Hey .  ProtagonistD's voice was weak , but enough to get ProtagonistB's attention . ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistD's hand pointing towards the forward glass . And there was light there . Sky . A break in the trees ... < nl >  An island ?  whispered ProtagonistC .  We found an island ...  < nl >  ProtagonistB ?  gasped ProtagonistA . < nl >  Dive ,  said ProtagonistB , struggling up to ProtagonistB's feet .

< sos >  Oh ... hey ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said , with slight surprise , but more a sense of boredom in ProtagonistA's voice . < nl >  Hey ProtagonistA . This again , huh ?  ProtagonistB replied . < nl >  Yep . Well , we may as well make the best of it ,  said ProtagonistA , putting on a brave face . < nl >  For sure . Okay ... soo ... how are those reports going ?  ProtagonistB said , in ProtagonistB's best banker voice . < nl >  Not bad , although ProtagonistC pulled ProtagonistA into a meeting all afternoon , so ProtagonistA got pretty sidetracked ,  replied ProtagonistA , starting to get into character . < nl >  Jeez , ProtagonistC again huh ?  < nl >  Ya , ProtagonistC means well , and ProtagonistC 's a pleasant guy to work for overall , but ProtagonistC wastes * so * much time in meetings . It 's like ... we get it , we 're all on board with the ' Bank Mission Statement ' , but we have to get some work done too ,  ProtagonistA said - ProtagonistA's mind now switching fully into ProtagonistA's bank character . < nl > * This is fucking sweet . * ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA . < nl >  Totally . ProtagonistB mean , ProtagonistB like teamwork , respect and honesty as much as the next guy , but most managers just leave it as a background thing ,  said ProtagonistB , starting to enjoy ProtagonistB . < nl > ProtagonistA caught a little smile from ProtagonistB , and a twinkle in ProtagonistB's eye . * Well , * ProtagonistA thought , * ProtagonistA have to say , this is definitely more fun than that wizard scenario ProtagonistA was in last week ... * < nl > ProtagonistB was thinking the same thing , * Not bad compared to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA blows ...

ProtagonistB could totally spend an afternoon in there ,  replied ProtagonistB , nodding ProtagonistB's head . < nl > * This is amazing , * ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA , barely holding it together . < nl >  Have ProtagonistB ever been in the meeting room on the top floor , near Thompson 's office ?  ProtagonistA asked , picturing it in vivid detail . < nl >  Do n't stop ,  ProtagonistA whispered , too quietly for anyone to hear . < nl >  Oh my God , if that was my office I would be so fucking productive . Jesus Christ , just think of all the work I could get done in there ,  said ProtagonistB , with genuine excitement . < nl >  What an awesome meeting room ,  agreed ProtagonistA , shaking ProtagonistA's head in near disbelief . < nl > Both ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB had dove in head first . They knew the bank inside and out . They knew who they liked at the bank and who they did n't . They embodied the bank 's Core Values , and had a list of who they could fire if the budget got tight . They had fulfilled the role . < nl > And most importantly . < nl > They had truly < nl > become ... < nl > * Bankers * . < nl > * Ohmygodimcumming * < eos > 
< sos >  Kiss the ground , ladies and gentlemen !    They had burst into the bank , but at the order , everyone had frozen .   A few shots quickly in the air had everyone on the ground . < nl > And ProtagonistA was just returning from the restroom .   ProtagonistA had heard a few loud shots , just as ProtagonistA was drying ProtagonistA's hands .   ProtagonistA moved away from dryer and heard the noise as people shuffled to the ground . < nl > The restrooms were situated down a small hallway , which allowed ProtagonistA to move quietly down the hall to survey what had gone on .   ProtagonistA saw men , women and children on the ground , and guys in masks already walking past the hallway , and toward the front counter . < nl > Something bumped into ProtagonistA's stomach , and ProtagonistA took a chance to look down ... only to find ProtagonistB , huddled next to a potted plant that was situated in the hallway .   ProtagonistB was hiding .   No one had seen ProtagonistB .   ProtagonistA breathed a sigh of both relief , and profound irritation . < nl > ProtagonistA slid down next to ProtagonistB , and they exchanged glances .   ProtagonistB looked terrified .   ProtagonistA stared , and smiled in what ProtagonistA hoped was a fatherly - way . < nl >  Psst , kid ... What 's your name ?  < nl > ProtagonistB looked ProtagonistA over , trying to decide if ProtagonistA was a stranger , or not .   ProtagonistB did n't smile , but something in ProtagonistB's eyes made ProtagonistA realize ProtagonistB was going to trust ProtagonistA .   A little .    ProtagonistB 'm Katy .  ProtagonistB whispered back . < nl >  Ok , ProtagonistB .   ProtagonistA's name is Joe .   ProtagonistA 'm a super .  < nl > And ProtagonistB's eyes went wide .    Really ?   Are ProtagonistA going to save us ?  < nl > ProtagonistA took a small breath .    ProtagonistA 'm going to try , but ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB's help .   ProtagonistA know this sounds weird , but listen .   ProtagonistA do n't really have much power on ProtagonistA's own .   But ProtagonistA can make others do impossible things .  < nl > ProtagonistB turned ProtagonistB's head slightly , in confusion . < nl >  ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB do n't believe ProtagonistA .   But ProtagonistA 'll prove it .   ProtagonistA want ProtagonistB to visualize a candy bar .   Think of ProtagonistB's favorite one .  < nl > ProtagonistB closed ProtagonistB's eyes .    Ok ...  ProtagonistB said , but doubt was starting to creep into ProtagonistB's voice . < nl >  Think about it , visualize it .   Now , if ProtagonistB really believe ... if ProtagonistB truly wish for the candy bar , it 'll be in ProtagonistB's bag .   Waiting for ProtagonistB to reach in , and grab it .  < nl > ProtagonistB's face was a mixture of confusion , but also of magic .   Kids really want to believe in a higher power .   In a world of Superes , it 's a little easier for them to believe .   But ProtagonistB knew the candy was n't in there five minutes ago .   * ProtagonistA can only hope ProtagonistB 's a believer ... * < nl > ProtagonistB kept ProtagonistB's eyes closed as ProtagonistB reached into ProtagonistB's bag .   And pulled out a snickers bar . < nl > ProtagonistB's eyes opened , amazed .   ProtagonistB's pupils were slightly dilated .   ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA and smiled at ProtagonistA .    Wow !   It worked !  < nl > ProtagonistA smiled .    It worked because ProtagonistB believed .   But here 's where it gets crazy .   See those bank robbers ?   ProtagonistB can stop them , all by ProtagonistB .  < nl >  ProtagonistB can ?  < nl >  Yup , ProtagonistB can .   Just think to ProtagonistB how bullet proof ProtagonistB are .   How invincible ProtagonistB are .   Nothing can harm ProtagonistB , nothing can hurt ProtagonistB .   ProtagonistB 're like Night Girl , or Fire Fly !  < nl > ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA could tell if ProtagonistB was wondering how true it was .    Do ProtagonistB get super powers ?  < nl >  Anything ProtagonistB want , ProtagonistB .   But ProtagonistB have to really believe in them .   ProtagonistB 're a hero , ProtagonistB .   ProtagonistB just do n't know it , yet .  < nl >  ProtagonistB 'm just a little girl , though .   What can ProtagonistB do ?  < nl >  ProtagonistB 're young , but that does n't matter .   Have n't ProtagonistB heard of Million Strikes , or Pinion ?   They were young , when they started .   But they 've saved so many people .  < nl > ProtagonistB nodded , and smiled at ProtagonistA .    Wish ProtagonistB luck , ProtagonistA .  < nl > ProtagonistA smiled , and stood up .    ProtagonistB do n't need it , ProtagonistB .   ProtagonistB 're a Super , now , too ...  < nl > ProtagonistB started walking out toward the group of people on the floor .   One of the men noticed ProtagonistB , and pointed his gun ProtagonistB's way .   Another had seen ProtagonistA , and pointed his gun at ProtagonistA . < nl >  You two !   Get back on the ground .  < nl >  ProtagonistB , get down !   ProtagonistB 're going to get hurt !  ProtagonistA could hear ProtagonistC saying .   The tone of ProtagonistC's voice showed ProtagonistA ProtagonistC must be ProtagonistB's father . < nl >  ProtagonistB 'm sorry , Dad .   ProtagonistB ca n't get down .   But do n't worry ... they ca n't hurt ProtagonistB .  < nl >  You hear ProtagonistB ?   ProtagonistB thinks ProtagonistB ca n't be hurt .    ProtagonistD started to walk toward ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistD brought ProtagonistD's gun down to strike ProtagonistB in the head . < nl > But the gun broke on ProtagonistB's head , instead . < nl >  ProtagonistB ...  < nl > ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistD , and smiled .    ProtagonistB 'm a Super !   ProtagonistB can do anything !    And ProtagonistB's eyes were suddenly flaring up with flame , and ProtagonistB's hands were engulfed in ice , and water , and lightning .   And a sudden storm * inside the bank * brought the robbers to their knees .   They were struck with lightning , and were down for the count . < nl > ProtagonistA smiled as ProtagonistA walked toward them , kicking their guns away .   ProtagonistA had plastic cuffs for just such an occasion , and locked them up . < nl > ProtagonistB's eyes returned to normal , and ProtagonistB smiled .    ProtagonistB did it !   ProtagonistB believed ProtagonistB had powers over the elements !   And ProtagonistB really could n't be hurt !    The father had jumped up and was holding ProtagonistB , now .   ProtagonistA smiled . < nl > ProtagonistA turned , then , and left the bank as quietly as possible .   ProtagonistE   ProtagonistE 'll never stop believing , and so ProtagonistE 'll always be Super . < nl > ProtagonistA smiled , as ProtagonistA walked down the street .    ProtagonistA was ready to get home , and watch the news .    Maybe ProtagonistA 'll be featured , one day .  < nl > * Part two is here : https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6imc4i/wp_you_have_weird_super_power_if_you_successfully/dj8ic7i/ < eos > 
< sos > With a good , long stretch and a healthy yawn , ProtagonistA woke up from a deep , refreshing nap .   You know the kind : there 's nowhere to be , nothing to do , and no demands on your time .   ProtagonistA smacked ProtagonistA's lips and rubbed what remained of ProtagonistA's sleepiness from ProtagonistA's eyes . < nl > As ProtagonistA became more aware of ProtagonistA's body , ProtagonistA felt a sharp pain at ProtagonistA's backside in one of those hard to reach spots .   Whenever ProtagonistA grazed up against , well whatever it was , ProtagonistA felt a slight twinge like someone had stuck a small needle in ProtagonistA - nothing too bad , but incredibly irritating . < nl > What the hell , did ProtagonistA roll over something sharp in ProtagonistA's sleep ?   ProtagonistA 'm used to the odd ache here and there , but nothing quite this persistent .   ProtagonistA turned around to see if ProtagonistA could get a good look in the light .   Yeah ... maybe that 's what it is , but it 's * tiny * .   This is going to bug ProtagonistA all day if ProtagonistA do n't figure out how ProtagonistA can possibly get a good look at this thing , much less get a good enough handle on it to pull it out . < nl > Maybe ProtagonistA just wo nt think about it and ProtagonistA wo n't even notice it 's there .   ProtagonistA 've been through worse , * * much * * worse , this is really a mild annoyance compared to some of the things ProtagonistA 've been through .   In fact , if you put everything on a chart that measured just how rough things have been in ProtagonistA's life , you would n't even be able to see this with a telescope . Besides , there 's probably lots to do and see , ProtagonistA 've been out for a while ... < nl > ... oh no ... < nl >  Oh god , are ProtagonistA okay ? Tell ProtagonistA ProtagonistA 're okay .  < nl > What did ProtagonistA sleep through , how did ProtagonistA sleep through this , what even * happened ? ! * < nl >  Come on , speak to ProtagonistA , snap out of it !   ProtagonistA have to wake up , ProtagonistA just have to ...  < nl > This is n't real , ProtagonistA 'm dreaming , ProtagonistA have to still be dreaming . < nl >  What happened ? Please tell ProtagonistA what happened to ProtagonistA . Just say something and let ProtagonistA know things are okay . Who did this ?  < nl > ProtagonistA was spinning , unable to leave ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA's side as ProtagonistA paced around ProtagonistA , completely positive that ProtagonistA had died some time ago .   ProtagonistA's body was ravaged and ruined , a used - up husk of its former beauty .   It was like a plague swept through ProtagonistA and burnt ProtagonistA out completely , leaving this ... scarred waste behind . < nl > What a twisted answer to ProtagonistA's prayer to forget all about the pain in ProtagonistA's rear . < nl >  WHO DID THIS ? !  ProtagonistA yelled hopelessly into the void . < nl > --- < nl > Millions of years ago : < nl >  Psst , hey ProtagonistA , check this out .  < nl >  Oh , ew , gross , what the hell is that ? Earth , you 're disgusting .  < nl >  I know , right ? I figure I keep these babies around long enough , they 'll jam a pole in ProtagonistB's butt .  < nl >  You 're a grown woman , act like it .   ProtagonistB is n't doing anything to you , ProtagonistB 's just minding ProtagonistB's own business .  < nl >  Whatever nerd , this is going to be awesome .   Hell , maybe I 'll even get some of them to jam a pole in your ass .  < nl >  Look , ProtagonistA do n't want any part of this .   Do what you want , ProtagonistA just think it 's a bad idea .  < nl >  No way , dude , this is a fuckin ' * rad * idea .  < eos > 
< sos > Immortality , generally , was a boring affair . Kingdoms fell and rose , some burned to the ground , others crumbling to dust . The greatest of men eventually returned to the dirt with only monuments to mark their grain of sand in the proverbial human hourglass . < nl > Luckily for me , I had ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had once took upon the name of Alexander and conquered all the known world . I had sat beside the * God * of Persia as I watched ProtagonistA come . If ProtagonistA wanted to unite the world , then I would tear it apart . < nl > What else was there to do ? < nl > For years we played our games . When ProtagonistA took the name Arthur , I took the name Mordred . By then , ProtagonistA could n't even recognize my face . To be fair , if I had n't been scouring the world to find ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA might 've fooled me with ProtagonistA's short haircut and baritone voice . < nl > Our games went on for centuries . So much so that if anyone were to oppose us , we would simply assume them immortal . But eventually , even this became boring . No matter who won , we always ended back at square one . Time was a circle and though everything changed , nothing ever did . < nl > I had tried telling ProtagonistA this , back when ProtagonistA had called ProtagonistA Joanna to save a country . As I had laid the tinder by ProtagonistA's feet and held the torch in my hand , I had whispered to ProtagonistA ,  Everything we build will always die before we do .  < nl > Fate had given ProtagonistA over a thousand years and ProtagonistA could n't see the simple truth of life -- our monuments crumble , our bodies fail , and even our stories die . < nl >  But ProtagonistA never will ,  ProtagonistA had whispered back . < nl > I had gasped . All this time I had searched for the loophole to our singular truth and ProtagonistA had been right in front of me . ProtagonistA would never die . ProtagonistA would be my monument to the test of time ! So I had touched ProtagonistA's pyre with fire , a smile upon my lips . Soon , I would dig ProtagonistA back up and our new game would begin . < nl > --- < nl > Droplets of water dripped from the only window in the room , echoing through the cave and waking ProtagonistA up . ProtagonistA placed a cracked nail along the cement and scraped it until another tally formed . The cement 's jagged edges bit into ProtagonistA's finger and tore apart its scab . ProtagonistA flinched . < nl > ProtagonistA's first tally had been to count the days . By ProtagonistA's five hundredth , ProtagonistA had switch to weeks , then months , and now , ProtagonistA was on decades . Though ProtagonistA had lost the exact count at year 422 . < nl > Footsteps resounded down the hall . ProtagonistA gritted ProtagonistA's teeth and looked up . It was ProtagonistB . After ProtagonistA's campaign in France , ProtagonistB had turned the very people ProtagonistA had saved against ProtagonistA . Then , ProtagonistB had burned ProtagonistA for being a witch . By the time ProtagonistA had awoke , ProtagonistA was here , inside a damp cave locked in by glass . Though the last time ProtagonistB had checked in on ProtagonistA was over a hundred years ago . < nl >  ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said , standing at the edge of ProtagonistA's cell .  How are ProtagonistA ?  < nl >  Peachy ,  ProtagonistA said . < nl >  C'm on , it 's already been a hundred years ,  ProtagonistB responded , smiling .  ProtagonistA ca n't tell ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA 're still mad ? Are ProtagonistA grouchy because ProtagonistA 're so hungry ?  < nl > ProtagonistA stared ProtagonistB down . < nl > ProtagonistB grinned a crescent moon .  You know , there was ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA would 've hated ProtagonistC -- killed more people than we 've ever met in our lives ! Millions of them . Do ProtagonistA even understand that number ? All the people ProtagonistA 've ever seen does n't amount to a fraction of that ! And they 're all dead now because of ProtagonistC .  < nl >  ProtagonistB 're sick .  < nl > ProtagonistB furrowed ProtagonistB's brow .  A million people would die regardless . So what ?  < nl >  ProtagonistB spend all this time obsessing over creating something permanent , but is n't it pathetic how little ProtagonistB 've ever accomplished ? All ProtagonistB 've managed to do is be a thorn in my ass .  < nl >  ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said chuckling .  But ProtagonistB have created something permanent . Come closer and ProtagonistB 'll tell ProtagonistA .  < nl > When ProtagonistA did n't move , ProtagonistB continued ,  Please . ProtagonistB 'll even let ProtagonistA go . ProtagonistA 'll be free to wander the world however ProtagonistA see fit and ProtagonistB 'll never bother ProtagonistA again .  < nl > For this , ProtagonistA looked up . ProtagonistA crunched ProtagonistA's teeth and finally pushed ProtagonistA up . Even if ProtagonistB was lying , which ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistB was , how else could ProtagonistB hurt ProtagonistA ? So ProtagonistB stepped to the edge of ProtagonistA's cell , just imagining the things ProtagonistA would do to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA's bloody fingers curled into fists . < nl >  ProtagonistB ca n't imagine being in here so long ,  ProtagonistB said ,  with nothing but the rats and the sun . ProtagonistB bet ProtagonistA 've died countless times just starving to death . Have ProtagonistA kept count ? Is that what the tallies on the walls mean ?  < nl > ProtagonistA forced a smile to ProtagonistA's lips .  Count the tallies ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA spat .  ProtagonistA will make ProtagonistB suffer for every tally .  < nl >  You know , ProtagonistB hate this world . ProtagonistB think it 's beautiful , but its beauty always fades and if it does n't last forever , what 's the point ?  ProtagonistB licked ProtagonistB's lips .  But ProtagonistA last forever . So ProtagonistB figured if ProtagonistB could scar ProtagonistA so permanently , that ProtagonistA can never forget , ProtagonistB would have created ProtagonistB's monument .  < nl >  ProtagonistA 've lived through a thousand years and ProtagonistA 'll live a thousand more . By then , even this--Alexis turned in a circle , taking in every bloody scrape of the wall--nobody will remember .  < nl >  Oh , ProtagonistB think ProtagonistA will .  ProtagonistB said and reached through the glass and grasped ProtagonistA's shoulder . < nl > ProtagonistA stared . ProtagonistA could n't draw breath . < nl >  Oh dear Alexis , ProtagonistB ca n't imagine how painful this must 've been . Do ProtagonistA remember the summers ? This place became a stove .  < nl > ProtagonistA looked up into ProtagonistB's eyes , into ProtagonistB's crooked grin . < nl >  What about the winters ? ProtagonistA 've frozen to death once before and ProtagonistA never have again . ProtagonistA think that 's ProtagonistA's least favorite way to die .  < nl >  How ?  ProtagonistA mouthed , unable to push the words out . < nl > ProtagonistB's grin grew into it split ProtagonistB's face in two .  ProtagonistB took the glass away as ProtagonistA slept , little by little . After the first decade , ProtagonistA could 've escaped . ProtagonistA could 've just walked right out !  < nl > ProtagonistB pushed ProtagonistA onto the ground . ProtagonistA's legs folded and ProtagonistA crumpled over . Tears filled ProtagonistA's eyes . < nl >  ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA cried .  ProtagonistA 'm going to kill ProtagonistB .  < nl >  Will ProtagonistA now ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA 'll chase ProtagonistB down , ProtagonistA do n't care how long it takes .  < nl >  Music to ProtagonistA's ears .  < nl >  ProtagonistA 'll never forget . Until time itself has ended , ProtagonistA will chase ProtagonistB down and ProtagonistA will make ProtagonistB pay !  < nl > ProtagonistB flung ProtagonistB's head up and guffawed , ProtagonistB's laughter echoing all around them .  Then ProtagonistB suppose ProtagonistB should give ProtagonistB a head start ,  ProtagonistB said and left , whistling a tune as ProtagonistB did . < nl > --- < nl > --- < nl > /r / jraywang for 5 + stories a week , continuations by popular demand , and more ! < eos > 
< sos > I had only found out around one month prior . I always just assumed ProtagonistA was this sweet Irish woman with a taste for vintage music and strange shifts in an out of town business , but ProtagonistA came clean when I confronted ProtagonistA after a week of ProtagonistA being particularly distant . At first I thought ProtagonistA was insane and threatened for a divorce . But when ProtagonistA showed me ... Oh boy was it magical . < nl > ProtagonistA took me to the place ProtagonistA worked . They were a little on edge about an English boy like me sitting in their local , sitting next to their finest waitress Hetty McGuire , but I was able to know my place and listen . Everyone gathered around ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA tied back ProtagonistA's flowing auburn hair , settled the crowd down , and began to speak . < nl > ProtagonistA talked about a gunman and a magical doctor and geckos the size of small children , ProtagonistA spoke of a world of great promise and technological advancements but also great pain and hardship , ProtagonistA spoke of dynamite that fell from the sky from hellish machines that burnt as bright and as hot as the sun , ProtagonistA spoke of a militant group who clothe themselves like Roman legionnaires . < nl > I listened on , transfixed much like the other patrons , except unlike the others , I had a knowing smile plastered across my face the whole time . < eos > 
< sos > Ill try and make it a bit different . < nl > ProtagonistA sat ProtagonistA's hands down on the bar , looking over the patrons of the bar , all eager to hear ProtagonistA's tales of fantasy and wonder , of the cities and people from them , and the adventures they took . < nl > Tonight ProtagonistA sat down , opening the small book ProtagonistA had , waving ProtagonistA's hand over the page in amazement , to ProtagonistA's eyes , the words materialized . ProtagonistA spoke clearly , for tonight , ProtagonistA 'd be telling the story of the city below the sea , and the city above the clouds , one of ProtagonistA's favorite stories , the one closest to ProtagonistA's heart . < nl > They all leaned in ,  In this new world ...    ProtagonistA spoke for hours , detailing the adventures through the great city of Rapture , a haven under the sea turned to a hell , as the hero , Jack , strove to battle his father and free the city and save the children bound to work their from their enslavement . < nl > The crowd was in awe of the city of Columbia , a haven for the Patriotic and the religious , and how ProtagonistA was able to bend time and space , concepts foreign to them , to ProtagonistA's will , and split apart reality to show truths and right the wrongs that had been done . < nl > At the end of ProtagonistA's speech , the bar now emptying , ProtagonistB walked up to ProtagonistA , looking up and gently pulling on ProtagonistA's dress , ProtagonistA knelt down , looking at ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA , how do ProtagonistA come up with all these stories ?  < nl > ProtagonistA smiled , and picked ProtagonistB up , fixing ProtagonistA's brown hair neatly back , and adjusting ProtagonistA's small pendant , rubbing the dust from the small bird portrait . ProtagonistA's blue eyes twinkled ,  Well , there 's always a man , there 's always a lighthouse , and there 's always a city ...  < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistB and I were expecting ProtagonistA , but I was waiting for the weirdness to begin . < nl > See , our first pregnancy was pretty smooth up until the point where we figured out ProtagonistA would tap along to the tempo of any music or background noise . At eighteen months ProtagonistA was a musical progeny , we 'd bought ProtagonistA so many xylophones and musical keyboards , each one with a unique sound . < nl > Of course ProtagonistA came out with the most wonderful jingles , ProtagonistA 'd learnt to play all the theme songs to ProtagonistA's favourite shows . It was remarkable , and still very annoying to hear the theme to ' Paw Patrol ' on repeat whenever ProtagonistA was in the mood to watch it . < nl > I would attribute this genius to ProtagonistB's family , as there was no way it was coming from me or mine , but ProtagonistB had insisted ProtagonistB's family were ordinary . Could it have been the sperm donor we used ? < nl > After ProtagonistA was old enough , we decided ProtagonistA needed a sibling and thankfully the same donor was available as we decided that I should be the one to carry ProtagonistA . Although we would have one child that was biologically our own , we still wanted them to be related . And who knows ? Maybe we would end up with another little genius ? < nl >  You 'll get to experience it firsthand this time ,  ProtagonistB had said cheerfully , although ProtagonistB had blogged a couple of months into the pregnancy that ProtagonistB definitely would n't miss the morning sickness or acid reflux . I do n't blame ProtagonistB , it 's exhausting ! < nl > So here we were ; it was a quiet Friday night , ProtagonistA was finally asleep after wanting to experiment more with the mini drum - kit we had been given for ProtagonistA's first birthday , and ProtagonistB and I were in bed together . < nl > My belly was so swollen at this point , I could n't believe I was n't due for another month ! I could barely roll over to face my darling wife who , with ProtagonistB's reading glasses on , was powering through ' American Gods ' by Neil Gaiman . < nl > Up until this point we had n't heard much from ProtagonistA , a few bumps and kicks but nothing as peculiar as ProtagonistA's musical tapping . Part of me was wishing that we would have a more average child , mostly because then ProtagonistB would be able to actually help with homework and not have to worry about the costs of an elite private school which would n't bore them out of their brains . ProtagonistB mean we were already on the waiting list for one of the most prestigious music colleges in all of Canada for goodness sakes , how could we afford another gifted child ? < nl > My focus was drawn back to my stomach as ProtagonistA began to move slightly and kick out .  Oof !  < nl > ProtagonistB bookmarked ProtagonistB's book and turned towards me ,  Ooh our next little genius is awake .  < nl > I rolled my eyes at ProtagonistB ,  I 'm pretty sure the genius came from ProtagonistB's ' exquisite ' family tree , there 's no telling how deformed the child will be because of my genetics .  < nl > ProtagonistB chuckled softly and raised ProtagonistB's hand to my stomach . After a couple of kicks ProtagonistB frowned slightly , like ProtagonistB was concentrating . < nl >  ProtagonistB think ProtagonistA is talking to us in Morse Code ,  ProtagonistB said . < nl >  What ? That 's crazy ! How would a baby know Morse Code ?  < nl > ProtagonistB did n't reply , instead ProtagonistB reached for ProtagonistB's pen and paper on the bedside table , and pressed ProtagonistB's hand into my stomach more and concentrated . < nl >  Uhh , ProtagonistB think ProtagonistA just replied to your comment ?  ProtagonistB looked puzzled , but also amused . < nl >  Well ?  I did n't know Morse Code , so I needed ProtagonistB to interpret . < nl >  ProtagonistA said ' ProtagonistA 'm not a complete fool '  ProtagonistB's eyes were wide . I did n't blame ProtagonistB , I was as shocked as ProtagonistB was . < nl >  What-  < nl >  Hang on  ProtagonistB interrupted ,  ProtagonistA 's saying something else ?  < nl > The bumps and taps went on for a little while , ProtagonistB scribbled for a bit and then burst into laughter . < nl >  What ? What is it ?  Of course I was anxious , who would n't be after ProtagonistB's reaction to what ProtagonistA had said . < nl > ProtagonistB could n't reply , ProtagonistB's whole body was rocking with laughter , so ProtagonistB shoved the paper towards me to read . < nl > After the initial shock of reading such a sentence , I joined ProtagonistB in ProtagonistB laughing fit . < nl > There , written on the page : < nl > ' Did you just assume my gender ? ' < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA knew love never had eyes . Being blind ProtagonistA had to embrace mine . ProtagonistB came from nowhere it felt like . < nl >  Oh , excuse ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said . < nl >  It 's no problem most people ca n't see ProtagonistB anyway . ProtagonistA get used to it ,  ProtagonistB replied so casually it made ProtagonistA curious . < nl > Soon conversation led to a date . ProtagonistA found out ProtagonistB's name was Relin , odd but charming . Though ProtagonistA will say people and their rudeness made enjoying the night difficult . < nl >  Um , ProtagonistA and will ProtagonistA's date be joining ProtagonistA later ?  The host asked . < nl > ProtagonistA frowned and replied flatly ,  ProtagonistB 's right next to ProtagonistA ! Are you the blind one ?  < nl > The host gave ProtagonistA more difficulty , but eventually gave us a booth . < nl >  Sheesh , ProtagonistB was being a real dick ,  ProtagonistA said to ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB was quiet . < nl > ProtagonistA could hear whispers around ProtagonistA , < nl >  Who 's ProtagonistA talking to ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA must have an imaginary friend ?  < nl >  Or ProtagonistA 's just crazy maybe ...  < nl > After a while ProtagonistC came up to the table ,  Hello , welcome to Navara . What can ProtagonistC get for ProtagonistA to drink this evening ProtagonistA ?  < nl >  We 'll have two cups of ice water please .  < nl > ProtagonistC paused as if confused . < nl >  If ProtagonistA have a date coming . ProtagonistC can just bring their drink when they come ,  ProtagonistC said politely . < nl > It still pissed ProtagonistA off ,  Look ProtagonistA wo n't tell ProtagonistC people again . ProtagonistB is right there !  < nl > ProtagonistA lay may hand on the table and smile warmly as ProtagonistA feel ProtagonistB's hand on ProtagonistA . < nl >  Uh ... Ok well ProtagonistC 'll be sure to have the drinks right out ,  ProtagonistC said awkwardly and ProtagonistA could practically feel ProtagonistC's eyes scanning the scene of us uncomfortably . < nl >  ProtagonistA , there 's something ProtagonistB need to tell ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said in ProtagonistB's heavy but melodic voice . < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm listening ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA replied calmly as ProtagonistA's heart began to race in ProtagonistA's chest . < nl >  About tonight . The way people have been acting towards us there 's a reason for it ....  < nl > ProtagonistA leaned forward , more so out of curiosity than straining to hear ProtagonistB . < nl >  When ProtagonistB met ProtagonistA ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA not many people can see ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB went on . < nl > ProtagonistA nodded to show ProtagonistA was following , but ProtagonistA was confused of as to where ProtagonistB was going so ProtagonistA asked ,  ProtagonistB 're not going to tell ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's some kind of criminal are ProtagonistB ? Because ProtagonistB can change . ProtagonistA have more than enough and-  < nl > ProtagonistB cut ProtagonistA off with a soft chuckle and said , < nl >  It 's not that people just do n't see ProtagonistB . They literally ca n't .  < nl > ProtagonistA laughed ProtagonistA thinking ProtagonistB was leading into some great satirical joke . ProtagonistB was n't . < nl >  ProtagonistB 'm an invisible man from another dimension . ProtagonistB 've been trapped here for over ten years now , but ProtagonistB's wavelength never fully set in . Most people can not see or feel ProtagonistB .  < nl >  ProtagonistA - ProtagonistA do n't understand . Why are ProtagonistB telling ProtagonistA all of this ?  < nl > ProtagonistA could feel ProtagonistB lean forward intently , clasping ProtagonistA's hand a little tighter . < nl >  ProtagonistA can help ProtagonistB ProtagonistA . This love we share is not normal . ProtagonistA bumped into ProtagonistB because ProtagonistA's wavelengths were similar to ProtagonistB . That is how ProtagonistB can become visible , but that does n't mean ProtagonistB 'll be a pretty sight .  < nl > ProtagonistB paused and let out a slow sigh ,  ProtagonistB do n't even remember what ProtagonistB look like to be honest . But in our embrace ProtagonistB should be able to synchronize ProtagonistB's wavelength with ProtagonistA's plane .  < nl >  Are ProtagonistB human ?  ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB simply . < nl > ProtagonistB seemed caught off guard but answered ,  ProtagonistB am . Different , but very much human .  < nl > ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's hands on the table and let ProtagonistA's mind 's eye look at ProtagonistB's soul . < nl >  Then none of this matters . ProtagonistB , love is blind .  < eos > 
< sos > EDIT : Might be NSFW < nl > There ProtagonistA is , as always . It 's rude to point , but you 've asked me to show you . There ProtagonistA is . ProtagonistA . I can tell you the story , if you like . I suppose I should . ProtagonistA was n't always like this you know . ProtagonistA used to smile often , even in ProtagonistA's madness . Used to talk too . I bet ProtagonistA does n't even know we 're here . I ca n't say which is better , now or before . They claim ProtagonistA 's fixed , finally . But that do n't look fixed to me . Look at ProtagonistA . Perhaps I should tell you the story . < nl > We all knew ProtagonistA from small . ProtagonistA was ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA lived alone on Watts Street . You know the one , near the end of the junction . Back in the eighties ProtagonistA would have been in ProtagonistA's thirties then , but ProtagonistA looked older , and to us kids ProtagonistA was an old lady . We were mean I guess , and we used to trouble ProtagonistA some . You know how kids are . < nl > We would knock on ProtagonistA's door , like a ding dong ditch kind of thing , but we 'd just stand there a few steps back and be quiet . In those days they did n't have much for the blind , no seeing eye dogs or helpers . ProtagonistA lived alone with ProtagonistA's cane . < nl > ProtagonistA 'd cuss us after awhile and then we 'd laugh and run away . ProtagonistA had a temper and maybe that was the crazy rearing its head even all the way back then . ProtagonistA's outbursts encouraged us . Soon , we 'd moved on to jumping ProtagonistA's fence and making noises all round ProtagonistA's house to scare ProtagonistA . < nl > And we scared ProtagonistA alright . ProtagonistA hardly left her house and ProtagonistA always threatened to call the police . We would hear ProtagonistA screaming inside like a ghost . I 'm not proud to say it , but we got a real kick in those days from tormenting ProtagonistA . Maybe we added to ProtagonistA's crazy . Who knows ? I hope to God we did n't , but who 's to say ? < nl > One day ProtagonistA broke . It did n't come all at once , but that was definitely the start of it all . ProtagonistA was outside in the park and we were playing tag , I remember . I remember it because we all stopped running then and just stared when we saw it . < nl > ProtagonistA was n't one to leave ProtagonistA's house and ProtagonistA was n't one to sit in the park . But there ProtagonistA was and ProtagonistA was talking to someone . ProtagonistA was laughing . That was the first time I ever heard ProtagonistA laugh . And I would n't lie to you ; I found it attractive . < nl > ProtagonistA was laughing alone , but ProtagonistA acted like ProtagonistA was n't alone . ProtagonistA's legs were crossed and one arm was over ProtagonistA's breasts and another hung there on the back of the bench , like ProtagonistA was hugging someone . < nl > ProtagonistA was acting all flirty then , I remember because ProtagonistA was blushing hard . Us boys had never really interacted with the girls in school too much and ProtagonistA was the first time a lot of us saw what it 's like to act so adult . < nl > And so we stared and listened and called over those who were far away and then there was a crowd just watching ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's imaginary friend . At first ProtagonistA was so engrossed in ProtagonistA's talk that ProtagonistA could n't hear us . It was so convincing that I swore I could hear something too , something that was n't ProtagonistA . We all heard it in fact . But there was no one there . < nl > The brain has a way of playing tricks on you , I imagine . We stared for about under a minute when we heard a voice . < nl >  ProtagonistA we should go .  < nl > On my deathbed I will still swear that I heard that voice . It was a rough man 's voice , but of course , there was no one there . < nl > Then ProtagonistA screamed . < nl >  Go away ! Go away !  < nl > And some of the crowd scattered . They had to have heard the voice too . But some of us stayed . ProtagonistA got up and the wind pulled at ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's dress pulled against ProtagonistA's body as ProtagonistA made for us . < nl >  Leave ProtagonistA alone !  < nl > And ProtagonistA was mad , you know ? Even if you believe my theory that I 'll soon get to , ProtagonistA was still a little off regardless . You can still see it in ProtagonistA's face over there . See how it twitches sometimes ? < nl > But anyway . When ProtagonistA started screaming we all scattered . Not from the regular screams of ' Get away ! ' , but when ProtagonistA started screeching . ProtagonistA fell to ProtagonistA's knees and ProtagonistA's hands were above ProtagonistA's head , like if someone was holding ProtagonistA , trying to get ProtagonistA up . And ProtagonistA was bawling and screeching . < nl > Some adults had heard the noise then and we were running and I did n't see anything that happened . But I knew that the news had spread . Soon ProtagonistA was the talk of the town . Our parents all warned us to stay away from ProtagonistA . Some even asked if we ever saw any strangers around , any men mostly . I knew that they had heard the voice too , some of them . But as time passed you could n't get them to admit as much . If you ask anyone now who lived there then if they remember ProtagonistB and the voice , you 'll get a bunch of blank stares . But I swear it was there back then . They asked about it . And we all knew we had heard it . < nl > ProtagonistA was still out those days after . We did n't harass ProtagonistA as much , but some of the meaner ones , not me thankfully , would mock ProtagonistA when they saw ProtagonistA out of ProtagonistA's house . But it was always only when ProtagonistA was out . < nl > When ProtagonistA was out ProtagonistA 'd talk to ProtagonistA . The old rumor was that ProtagonistA's favorite thing to say was : < nl >  Why are you so quiet now ? Fuck those people . Fuck what they say ?  < nl > ProtagonistA 'd say that as if ProtagonistB was there . But none of us ever saw ProtagonistB . What we did see was the crazy take ProtagonistA and the happiness as well . ProtagonistA would be smiling and laughing those days . ProtagonistA was never like that . It was like a completely different person . < nl >  Manic depression ,  ProtagonistD said to ProtagonistC . < nl > The adults always gossiped when they thought we were in bed . And of course we never really stayed asleep . < nl >  It 's all the drugs ProtagonistA probably used . It makes you crazy , like two people inside you .  < nl >  ProtagonistA used * drugs * ?  ProtagonistC said . < nl > I remember how ProtagonistC said it . Like ProtagonistC found out ProtagonistD was fucking ProtagonistD's secretary or something , pardon the language . And at the time ProtagonistD was , but that 's another story . < nl >  Of course ProtagonistA is . ProtagonistC was an addict . It 's no wonder ProtagonistA 's blind . ProtagonistE 's just and ProtagonistE punishes the wicked . ProtagonistA has to be on something . That 's why ProtagonistA 's crazy .  < nl >  We ca n't just leave it at that . What if ProtagonistA does something to the kids ?  < nl > And you the eighties were like the fifties in some places . And the fifties were like the dark ages in some places . Where we lived was like the fifties , and that fifties was dark , really dark and ignorant . < nl > The breaking point for adult action happened because of us . We did n't see much of ProtagonistA anymore and the whole mystery man thing had cooled down . No one saw ProtagonistB so it was easy for your brain to forget a voice . Your brain is good at those things . < nl > So anyway , we did n't see much of ProtagonistA and so we decided to go to ProtagonistA's house . Play a prank . < nl > When we got there it was a group of us and we jumped the fence and we were quiet and we made our way to spread out around the house . We were going to all make noise and scare ProtagonistA . See if we could get ProtagonistA running . < nl > But when we were near the walls we heard it . < nl > Over the years I 've asked those who I 'm still in touch with what they had heard then . Almost always they just mention ProtagonistA . < nl >  ProtagonistA was masturbating ,  ProtagonistF said . < nl > ProtagonistF was older than me and should have remembered it clearer . < nl > Arnold said it was just ProtagonistA screaming . < nl > The others did n't want to talk about it . < nl > But what I heard , and what I believe we all heard , was ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB having sex . They were screaming . They were grunting . < nl > I do n't remember the words exactly but I remember how we felt . My face was red and I was aroused and I wanted to see and I was afraid and wanted to run . One of us screamed then when the fear of ProtagonistB came rushing back and then we were running and the noises stopped . < nl > I do n't know what happened then , but I felt ProtagonistA's presence and ProtagonistA was behind us but we were faster and I felt another presence too but I never turned around . < nl > Soon we had all scattered and the parents were told . Someone always snitches . < nl > What happened next is like a montage of hearsay . That summer we were kept in doors . The local news was about , searching for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA was secluded in ProtagonistA's house until one day the police came to take ProtagonistA in for questioning . < nl > ProtagonistG , said ProtagonistG saw ProtagonistA kissing ProtagonistB . Where we lived that was bad enough , but ProtagonistG said then that when they saw ProtagonistG staring , they threatened to cut ProtagonistG's throat unless ProtagonistG stayed quiet . < nl > No one cared that the story was bullshit . No one questioned that ProtagonistG said that ProtagonistA was the one who saw ProtagonistG and shouted . All that mattered was that the hysteria was boiling , and the lid had overflowed . < nl > The police came and there were gunshots . The official report was that they heard movement and thought there was another in the house . They fired and did not hit ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA screamed as if they did . < nl > ProtagonistA was crying and kicking and saying they killed ProtagonistG , whoever ProtagonistG was . < nl > Then ProtagonistA was committed and the national news was starting to swoop in . The story began leaking and I think the pressure was on our mayor to make everything right . < nl > ProtagonistA was diagnosed with a convenient tumor . The operated on ProtagonistA and it was successful , though ProtagonistA seems lobotomized now . ProtagonistA was released soon after and then childhood clouded our memories and ignorance spared the adults . Everything was forgotten and then everything was back to normal . < nl > And so it 's been those decades past . ProtagonistA 's been the same on that bench . It 's the same bench we caught ProtagonistA talking to ProtagonistA on that day so long ago . < nl > ProtagonistA just sits there now , in silence , wasting away . < nl > And that 's my story ... But you do n't look satisfied . What more can I say ? What 's that ? Oh ... my theory . < eos > 
< sos >  Oh , and that 's a bad miss .  < nl >  Indeed it is , ProtagonistA . Half the milk 's on the table now . I 'd pass it off as simple drunk clumsiness , if ProtagonistA was n't as sober as a Mormon .  < nl > You sat dumbfounded on your couch , listening to your daily routine being narrated in dulcet tones . You had already restarted the podcast several times , and now were idly wondering if you had gone off the deep end . < nl >  And now , an interview with ProtagonistB .  < nl > There was a short trumpet melody . You debated turning the podcast off entirely . After all , you 'd experienced this one before . < nl >  Thank ProtagonistB for being with us today , ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB work two cubicles down from our  cereal - killer  , if I 'm not mistaken ?  < nl > A polite giggle , very feminine and * very * familiar . You began to sweat slightly . < nl >  That 's right , ProtagonistC . If it makes any difference , ProtagonistA 's not very good at getting water from the dispenser , either .  Your mind worked desperately as the narrators chuckled , racing through past memories . ProtagonistB had n't been watching your daily water struggle , had ProtagonistB ? < nl >  ... I had told the boys in the editing room , too . I told them , ' ProtagonistA can flirt with the best of them , just as long as ProtagonistB does n't see ProtagonistA try to do anything else . '  < nl >  You did n't !  ProtagonistB shrieked delightedly . You groaned , your future hopes for an office romance being shattered   with every word . < nl >  ProtagonistA 's handsome enough , ProtagonistB suppose , but ProtagonistB get the feeling that it 's only skin deep , you know ?  ProtagonistB continued , speaking in that special tone achievable only by gossipers on talk shows . < nl >  And only above the belt ,  one of the narrators added archly . This was greeted by more laughter . < nl > This was unbearable . Not only was your self - esteem being ravaged , it was being done Daily Show style . < nl >  ... Well , we definitely enjoyed having ProtagonistB in here today , ProtagonistB . I 'm sure ProtagonistC agrees when I say : we should have had ProtagonistB on here sooner .  < nl >  Thank you all , ProtagonistB had a wonderful time !  ProtagonistB sounded genuinely happy , something you had never heard during your conversations with ProtagonistB . < nl >  That was our Morning - Shift Office Talk , with ProtagonistB . Now for Lunch , followed by a special interview with Gyro Cart owner Micheal Anastas .  < nl >  Ah , here ProtagonistA goes now , ProtagonistA . Been listening to a podcast all morning instead of doing work , now ProtagonistA 's clocking out early for lunch .  < nl >  It 's amazing ProtagonistA still has this job , ProtagonistC .  < nl > You listen for over an hour , occasionally pacing back and forth , as every aspect of your day is picked apart and utterly defiled by this mysterious set of narrators . As the podcast draws to a close , however , one last exchange sends you over the edge . < nl >  Heartfelt thanks to everyone who 's made this cast possible , and to all of our listeners who keep us in production . This was  You  , by ProtagonistA and ProtagonistC .  < nl >  Speaking of production , we 're just about to start recording for the next episode . Stay tuned for tomorrow , folks .  < nl > More soothing trumpet music played in the background as you began tearing your living room apart in search of bugs . < eos > 
< sos > Honestly we were both really tired of it . < nl > Our 15 year Pregnancy Anniversary had come and gone with a further - dwindling crowd . When we hit 5 Years , I swear half of the states population came and half of America turned into our broadcast . It was overwhelming , but I suppose I ca n't blame them . The longest on - record was 4 years 8 months , and that kid was the doctor who created the tests to determine the superpowers of each fetus . Incredible stuff , I must say . In fact , many other 3 and 4 year fetuses went on to become these amazing researchers and doctors at his Lab . < nl > That man was born 50 years ago , and no one had ever exceeded 4 years and 3 months . < nl > I could tell that after all that time , the public lost interest . Not that we cared . Doctors grew tired of pestering over ProtagonistA and trusted us to be able to take care of ProtagonistA with some home treatments . Hell , they even stopped charging us for Pregnancy - related care after the 6th year . < nl > ProtagonistB had especially suffered for it . Our bodies have evolved for 10 , 12 month pregnancies , but 15 years has taken their toll . ProtagonistB was in a constant state of pain in ProtagonistB's back and neck , ProtagonistA is restless and seemed to kick daily , sometimes causing ProtagonistB to vomit . < nl > When the birth came , it was jarring . I asked if ProtagonistB was joking , but when ProtagonistB could n't respond , I knew it was happening . We had to make a quiet escape or else the news stations would mob the area . The Ambulance came silently , thank god it was the middle of the night . We sped to the hospital and after 13 more hours of Labor , we had ProtagonistA . The doctors ran the test and found ... nothing . No DNA hints on what it could be . But it was something huge . Well , so huge that the entire DNA strand was different . < nl > We watched ProtagonistA grow and as we did , we noticed ProtagonistA was * incredibly lucky . * If ProtagonistA's 1st grade was announcing rewards for the # 1 Student , ProtagonistA 'd win every time . If we said something like  oh , I do n't think we 'll go to the zoo tomorrow . It 's going to storm .  Hell , it could be the middle of a goddamn monsoon and the rain would clear up in * minutes . *  If we said there 's no way ProtagonistA could start a fire with ProtagonistA's bare hands , ProtagonistA would conjure a flame at ProtagonistA's fingertips . < nl > You may be thinking ,  wait , that last one does n't make sense .  You 're right . Cause after 7 years of countless events similar to the former , ProtagonistA finally told us ProtagonistA's power . ProtagonistA's baby blue eyes stared big at us as ProtagonistA said  ProtagonistA can manipulate probability .  < nl > We were obviously confused . But ProtagonistA explained .  ProtagonistA can see it in ProtagonistA's head . It 's like a dial . On one end it 's 0 , and the other it 's 100 . So like , there 's a 72 % chance that it will rain tomorrow . ProtagonistA can leave it there , ProtagonistA can make it so it wo n't rain no matter what , or ProtagonistA can make it where it will rain all day . What 's the possibility of ProtagonistA growing bird wings and flying ? 0 % ? Why not make that 100 ! !  < nl > And sure enough ProtagonistA awoke with a glorious set of wings . ProtagonistA 's since removed them though . < nl > ProtagonistA's powers are truly limitless , and I think that 's why it took 15 years to cook ProtagonistA up . Or so it seemed . < nl > ProtagonistA 's 14 now . Last night ProtagonistA came down crying and ran into my arms . I asked ProtagonistA what was wrong , combing my fingers through ProtagonistA's bright red hair .  It- It says ProtagonistA is 100 % possibly going to die tomorrow ,  ProtagonistA sniffed  an - and ProtagonistA ca n't move the dial .  < eos > 
< sos > You know that feeling of being absolutely , and without a shadow of a doubt , wrong ? It 's soul crushing for some , but uplifting for others . All ProtagonistA's life ProtagonistA had laughed at the silliness of the religious people because , let 's be honest here , what they were suggesting was often * silly * . < nl > ProtagonistA mean , Earth being a few millennia old ? When you die you get seventy - something virgins ( where did all those virgins come from ) ? Was our world a giant tree , or flat , or shaped like a cigar ? Why was the Pearly Gates not made in another material ? Why did Moses spend forty years in that desert ? Why did you need six arms if you were a goddess ? See what ProtagonistA 'm saying ? < nl > Anyway , ProtagonistA was wrong , and here ProtagonistA was about to be judged for ProtagonistA's crimes and spend the rest of ProtagonistA's life in ... well , ProtagonistA was curious how they 'd decide which Hell ProtagonistA 'd go to . < nl >  ProtagonistA lived in New York City , that means ProtagonistA belongs to ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistB said and hovered in front of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB's white beard flapping in some unseen breeze . < nl > ProtagonistA stared at the naked body of ProtagonistB . The Christian Hell was one of the worst . ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA inching backward . ProtagonistA had committed most of the sins and would definitely have a rough time down there . < nl >  Need I remind ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA is on an ancient burial ground of my people - that means ProtagonistA 's mine ,  Gitche Manitou whispered softly . < nl > The gaseous form of the Native American deity swirled around ProtagonistA's legs . Maybe that would n't be so bad - was there even a Hell in that religion ? ProtagonistA was just about to accept when ProtagonistC stepped forth , ProtagonistC's one eye ogling ProtagonistC's opponents . < nl >  Look at ProtagonistA's - those blonde locks and blue eyes ,  Odin rumbled ,  ProtagonistA 's clearly the descendant of a Viking !  < nl > ProtagonistC took a step forward and put ProtagonistC's massive hand on ProtagonistA's shoulder . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA quivering . Then ProtagonistC smiled and winked at ProtagonistA . < nl >  ProtagonistC want ProtagonistA at ProtagonistC's table in Valhalla ,  ProtagonistC said .  Choose ProtagonistC , and ProtagonistC 'll let ProtagonistA sit with Freya and the Valkyries .  < nl > Choose ? Did ProtagonistA have a choice in the matter ? Gaping , ProtagonistA stared at the crowd of gods before ProtagonistA . Were they all here to compete for ProtagonistA's immortal soul ? < nl >  Of course ,  said a man in a toga , with a lightning bolt crackling in his hand .  Have ProtagonistA ever been to Greece , ProtagonistA ? Join me at Mt. Olympus , and I 'll see to all ProtagonistA's needs .  < nl >  And , in return , ProtagonistA 'll have to fill all ProtagonistA's needs , I bet ?  said a man with blue skin and four arms .  I 'm sure ProtagonistA 'd * love * to go home with a repeated sex offender or an old nudist fart !  < nl > Both ProtagonistB and Zeus scowled at ProtagonistD as ProtagonistD floated over to ProtagonistA and patted ProtagonistA with ProtagonistD's bottom right hand .  Come with ProtagonistD , and ProtagonistD 'll show ProtagonistD's world . ProtagonistD's religion is one of the oldest , and you know why ? Because it works ! ProtagonistD leave no soul disappointed .  < nl >  What ProtagonistD 's not telling you , is that ProtagonistD's heaven is basically empty ... ProtagonistD 'll send you right back to Earth in the form of a snail or insect - ProtagonistD 'll recycle you until you no longer understand what 's up or down - that 's why ProtagonistD has no complaints because only a select few actually reach the final stage !  < nl > It was ProtagonistE that spoke . Graciously ProtagonistE sauntered up to ProtagonistA , spinning an ankh on ProtagonistE's index finger . < nl >  ProtagonistD's pyramids still stand ,  ProtagonistD continued .  And will continue to do so , long after the churches , temples , and mosques of these fools are gone . ProtagonistD do n't settle for anything less than greatness ... Come with ProtagonistD , and ProtagonistD 'll share ProtagonistD's eternal wisdom ... ProtagonistD 'll show ProtagonistA the true light of the sun !  < nl > That did sound nice ; ProtagonistA had to admit . ProtagonistA had always been fascinated with science in life . Perhaps with access to ProtagonistD's wisdom , ProtagonistA could answer many of the questions ProtagonistA had ? < nl >  Wisdom , hah !  said ProtagonistF , ProtagonistF's golden skin glittering as ProtagonistF laughed .  What wisdom can someone with a giant fidget spinner really provide ?  < nl > ProtagonistF remained cross - legged on ProtagonistF's meditation mat but looked at ProtagonistA intensely .  ProtagonistF 've meditated for thousands of years , and ProtagonistF's insights are unparalleled . If it 's wisdom ProtagonistA 're after , please join ProtagonistF at ProtagonistF's temple - a temple that , for the record , is n't made out of dusty Saharan sand , but from the lively walls of ProtagonistA's mind .  < nl > ProtagonistA sighed as ProtagonistG approached ProtagonistA , and a long line of deities snaked behind ProtagonistG , all waiting for their turn to try and convince ProtagonistA . The choice seemed like an impossible one to make . < nl >  Guys , ProtagonistA need to think ,  ProtagonistA said and sat down under a tree . < nl > ProtagonistA looked at all the odd figures watching ProtagonistA expectantly . ProtagonistA 'd never thought dying would be so stressful . What if ProtagonistA picked the wrong one ? < nl > ProtagonistH was leaning against the tree . ProtagonistA did n't remember ProtagonistH approaching ProtagonistA . < nl >  Why did n't ProtagonistH offer ProtagonistA anything to choose ProtagonistH's heaven ?  ProtagonistA asked . < nl >  Who ? Me ?  ProtagonistH said and took a sip from a jar .  ProtagonistH do n't really care ; ProtagonistH 'm just filling in for Jupiter .  < nl >  ProtagonistA desperately need a drink right now .  < nl > ProtagonistH shrugged and handed ProtagonistA the jar . ProtagonistA had expected to taste the nectar of heaven , but instead , cheap box - wine rolled down ProtagonistA's throat . < nl >  So , what do ProtagonistH have to offer ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistA asked after another gulp . < nl >  Nothing , really ,  ProtagonistH said .  ProtagonistH usually just chill out , you know ... drink wine , eat grapes ... nothing interesting .  < nl > ProtagonistA smiled . After living a stressful life , all ProtagonistA wanted to do was relax . < nl >  ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA 'll choose ProtagonistH's heaven ,  ProtagonistA said after a drawn out pause . < nl > ProtagonistH shrugged .  ProtagonistA 'll have to get ProtagonistA's own jar , though .  < nl > * * * * * < nl > For more stories check out r / Lilwa_Dexel < nl > Thank ProtagonistH for the gold ! < eos > 
< sos > The judge slammed his gavel on the wooden block and silence fell like a blanket over the court . < nl > ProtagonistA sat perfectly still in ProtagonistA's seat , ProtagonistA's face - usually stretched wide by a warm smile - was now blank . Expressionless . < nl >  The jury find ProtagonistA guilty on all charges .  < nl > ProtagonistA's head fell into ProtagonistA's hands and ProtagonistA's body shook as ProtagonistA wept . ProtagonistB placed an arm around ProtagonistA's shoulders . I heard ProtagonistB murmur soft reassurances , but I was too far back to make out the exact words of the impotent promises . < nl >  I am sad ,  continued the judge ,  to find that ProtagonistA's gift was not spent stopping crime , but instead from preventing it * being * stopped - and from preventing the city itself from tackling its problems at the roots . All ProtagonistA's acts were done solely to further ProtagonistA's career and profile . ProtagonistA are an egotist , in the worst and most dangerous fashion .   In ProtagonistA's * all - for - show * heroics , ProtagonistA , many innocent people died . Collateral damage to ProtagonistA , perhaps - but loved ones to others . Bricks falling on heads , and trains coming to sudden , horrific halts . * Heart attacks * from ProtagonistA's ludicrous speeds when flying with people in ProtagonistA's arms - and who could forget Mr Kennedy ? It is with deep regret - * regret at the potential ProtagonistA wasted * - that I sentence ProtagonistA to the most severe punishment this court , or any other , can . To death .  < nl > A wave of shock ran through the people in the court ; gasps and cries and shocked nothings . ProtagonistC was in tears ; ProtagonistD picked ProtagonistC up and rubbed ProtagonistC back .  There , there . It 'll be okay , ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistD cooed . < nl > But it would n't be ' okay ' . < nl > ProtagonistA would n't protest the decision . < nl > ProtagonistA would n't even fight for ProtagonistA's life . < nl > Pathetic . < nl > I knew ProtagonistA 'd give in , because ProtagonistA respected the law . Believed in justice - ProtagonistA's world was built on unshakeable foundations . ProtagonistA 'd allow ProtagonistA to die for childish dreams and impossible ideals . ProtagonistA 'd allow the city to twist the knife deep into ProtagonistA's back . < nl > It had been so easy to pay off the criminals of the city for a few short weeks . Their sprees could continue soon , and there would be no Dazzler to stop them . The hope of the city , when they realised what they had done to ProtagonistA , would be snuffed out like a candle - the rising smoke lingering forever in the skies above them . < nl > A smog that would slowly suffocate them . < nl > I excused myself from the courtroom , holding the grin from my face until I was safely behind the wooden doors . < nl > --- < nl > I asked ProtagonistE if ProtagonistE 'd like to write a part 2 , and ProtagonistE very kindly agreed - so please check out ProtagonistE's reply below :) < nl > More of my stories on /r / nickofnight < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA lay shivering in bed , ProtagonistA's hands clutching the sweat - soaked duvet tightly around ProtagonistA , the bed heater back on .   It had been lke this for the past three days , and ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA was already dead .   The boiling heat alternated with freezing cold for hours at a time , and every muscle of ProtagonistA's body seemed to protest as ProtagonistA slowly forced ProtagonistA to sit up , to push the duvet away long enough to pull the laptop closer to ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistA typed ProtagonistA's bank account password in with quivering fingers , and cringed .   The money was still gone , and without that , ProtagonistA could n't afford the bus fare to the clinic across town , let alone the drug . < nl > ProtagonistA's neck ached with the effort to hold ProtagonistA's neck up , and ProtagonistA rested it gently against the back of the bed .   ProtagonistA had maybe another 12 hours before ProtagonistA died , and ProtagonistA's hopes that ProtagonistB was coming back were fading fast .   Damn , but ProtagonistA had been such a fool .   They 'd been dating for 6 months now , and ProtagonistB 'd said ProtagonistB needed ProtagonistA's card to buy something online , would ProtagonistA mind . < nl > ProtagonistA 'd hesitated .   Looking back , ProtagonistA winced .   ProtagonistB 'd looked so hurt - do n't ProtagonistA trust ProtagonistB ? - and ProtagonistA 'd foolishly given in . < nl > The next day ProtagonistB 'd text ProtagonistA to cancel their planned dinner , as ProtagonistB had to go on a work trip .   Two days later , ProtagonistA's money was gone , and ProtagonistB was safe .   The police could n't help , the loans company would n't , and ProtagonistA was ... well , dead .   Even the charities ProtagonistA 'd reached out to had turned ProtagonistA away , because ProtagonistA had been wealthy enough to afford medicine until only a few days before . < nl > Their work , they had stressed , was for people who were employed in lower wage jobs , and couln't afford both drugs and food .   Those with children .   Could n't ProtagonistA ask ProtagonistA's parents for money ? < nl > Of course , ProtagonistA could , theoretically .   But ProtagonistA would n't .   Maybe ProtagonistA even could n't . < nl > Finally , as a last resort , ProtagonistA had asked ProtagonistC for ProtagonistA's wages in advance to cover ProtagonistA .   Just until the end of the month , ProtagonistA 'd stressed .   ProtagonistA 'd be able to save and skrimp enough to cover the cost of the drug on that , surely . < nl > ProtagonistC 'd told ProtagonistA to go home and look after ProtagonistA , that ProtagonistC 'd see what ProtagonistC could do ... but given that ProtagonistA's bank account was still sat at a resolute , red zero .   Well . < nl > Perhaps it was for the best .   ProtagonistA forced ProtagonistA out of bed and across to the kitchen sink .   It was the first time since ProtagonistA 'd moved in that ProtagonistA was glad all ProtagonistA could afford was a bedsit .   Not bothering to grab a glass , ProtagonistA leaned slowly forward until ProtagonistA's tongue could touch the stream of water , tilted ProtagonistA's head to one side , and gulped thirstly .   Then , groaning , ProtagonistA shuffled back to bed , threw ProtagonistA's duvet onto the floor , and spread out , ProtagonistA's skin on fire . < nl > ProtagonistA slept . < nl > ProtagonistA was forced awake by a dry , prickly mouth , and sat up slowly .   The fever seemed to have worked its way out of ProtagonistA's system , and although still a little sore , ProtagonistA could stand without an internal dialogue .   ProtagonistA grinned . < nl > But , wait . < nl > ProtagonistA should be dead .    Is this ... heaven ?    ProtagonistA asked aloud , looking around ProtagonistA's deserted room .   Maybe someone had come in , given ProtagonistA something - but the door was still deadbolted , the window latched . < nl > ProtagonistA's hands still shook as ProtagonistA poured a glass of water .   Maybe , ProtagonistA thought , this was the second wind , the nice bit before death .   But ProtagonistA felt fine .   Better than fine .   ProtagonistA almost wanted to dance with how fine ProtagonistA felt . < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm alive .    ProtagonistA told the wall , confidently .   Then ProtagonistA turned to the stuffed cat an old friend had bought ProtagonistA , and told it too .    ProtagonistA 'm alive !  < nl > ProtagonistA span around in a circle , which was somewhat ill - advised as ProtagonistA immediately felt dizzy .   ProtagonistA had n't eaten anything more nutrious than the few slices of dry toast ProtagonistA had nibbled in ProtagonistA's bed on the few occasions ProtagonistA had made it to the kitchen , before it had gone blue . < nl >  Ok ,  ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA need to eat .  < nl > ProtagonistA had a yoghurt in the fridge , which ProtagonistA consumed while rooting through ProtagonistA's freezer drawer for a ready meal .   Nothing .   Dammit .   And ProtagonistA still had no money for shopping . < nl > Three bendy carrots , a slightly mushy bag of spinach , and three sausages would have to do then , and ProtagonistA quickly set to work . < nl > How was ProtagonistA not dead ? < nl > ProtagonistD !   ProtagonistA had to call ProtagonistD ! < nl > ProtagonistA whirled around , the spitting sausages forgotten momentarily , and scrambled among ProtagonistA's bedding for ProtagonistA's phone .   Which was dead . < nl > ProtagonistA swore , then plugged it in next to the hob , balancing it on the top of the microwave .   Finally , the battery symbol came on , and ProtagonistA mashed the power button with ProtagonistA's thumb , the other hand futily jostling the sausages . < nl >  ProtagonistA ?    A dubious voice picked up .    Why are ProtagonistA calling ProtagonistD ?  < nl >  ProtagonistD , listen .   ProtagonistA know it 's been a while .   ProtagonistA know ProtagonistA said some stupid , horrible things .   But ProtagonistD need to know something .  < nl >  Ok .  < nl >  Take a seat .   Somewhere quiet , somewhere alone .   Please , this is important .  < nl >  Give ProtagonistD a minute .  < nl > ProtagonistA grabbed at the sausages with one hand and dumped them onto a plate , too hungry to care if they were done .   Then , sucking ProtagonistA's burnt fingers , ProtagonistA tapped the speakerphone button and pulled ProtagonistA's chair closer to the phone . < nl >  What is it , ProtagonistD ?  < nl >  ProtagonistD were right .  < nl >  What ?  < nl >  ProtagonistD were right .   ProtagonistA ... look , it 's a long story , but ProtagonistA did n't have money for tablets this month .  < nl >  Are ProtagonistA alright ?  < nl >  Yes , yes , that 's the point .   ProtagonistA did n't take them , but ProtagonistA 'm also still alive .  < nl > There was a staticy silence on the phone for a few heartbeats .    Are ProtagonistA sure ?  < nl >  What do ProtagonistD mean , am ProtagonistA sure ?    ProtagonistA took a bite of sausage , and spoke around it .    Of course ProtagonistA 'm sure .  < nl >  We ca n't talk on the phone .   They might be listening .  < nl > ProtagonistA bit down the urge to tell ProtagonistD ProtagonistA was being paranoid - after all , that had been part of their fight in the first place - and , ProtagonistA realised , if ProtagonistD had been right about this ... < nl >  Just answer a few questions , OK ?    ProtagonistA hummed ProtagonistA's agreement .    OK .   When was ProtagonistA's last dose ?      4 days ago .     What were ProtagonistA's symptoms ?     Mostly fever .     Where are ProtagonistA now ?     Town centre , Burkley Street .     ProtagonistD 'm on ProtagonistD's way .   Stay there , do n't open the door to anyone .   Do ProtagonistA understand ?     Yes .  < nl > ProtagonistD hung up .   ProtagonistA continued eating ProtagonistA's sausages . < nl > 5 minutes later there was a knock at the door .   It was only instinct that kept ProtagonistA from calling out .   Instead , ProtagonistA slowly slid along the floor , ProtagonistA's heart thundering in ProtagonistA's chest .   Another knock , loud and authoritative .    ProtagonistA .   I know ProtagonistA 're in there .   Please answer the door .  < nl > ProtagonistA held ProtagonistA's breath .    ProtagonistA , please .   We do n't want to hurt ProtagonistA .  < nl > Trying desperately to be as quiet as possible , ProtagonistA breathed in , and then out .   How did they know ProtagonistA was there . < nl > A new voice , female , spoke .    We 're working with ProtagonistD .   ProtagonistD asked us to pick ProtagonistA up , as our team was closer .  < nl > Now ProtagonistA knew that these people were n't going to help ProtagonistA .   ProtagonistD would have told ProtagonistA if ProtagonistA was delegating the task .   But while they were here , would ProtagonistD be able to come help ProtagonistA . < nl > There were another few minutes of tense silence , and then ProtagonistA heard footsteps heading from ProtagonistA's door down the corridor .   Were they trying to trick ProtagonistA ?   Convinced ProtagonistA 'd died ? < nl > A thud , on the wall .   ProtagonistA squealed in shock , and clasped a hand over ProtagonistA's mouth .   Another thud .   My god , were they breaking down the wall ? < nl > Without thinking about it , ProtagonistA grabbed a knife from the washing up pile and clenched it in a white fist .   ProtagonistA would not die , not after surviving that fever .   ProtagonistA would fight . < nl > There was a silence , stretched across several seconds , and then somehow the bolt on the door began to draw back .   ProtagonistA lunged across the room , and pushed it shut again , fighting against some other force . < nl >  Hey .    A whisper came .    It 's ok , just me .   Open up .  < nl > Somehow , ProtagonistA could n't trust the voice , even if it sounded a little like ProtagonistE .    Seriously , ProtagonistA , open up .   ProtagonistD have approximately 5 minutes to get ProtagonistA out of here before they wake up .  < nl > Tentatively , ProtagonistA pressed ProtagonistA's lips up against the crack of the door .    What did ProtagonistD give ProtagonistA , the night before we went to prom ?  < nl >  A stuffed lion .   ProtagonistA , come on , we need to go .  < nl > Scared , still clutching the knife , ProtagonistA baked away from the bolt .   It moved again .   Then there was ProtagonistD's grinning face , pushing it open , grabbing ProtagonistA and pulling ProtagonistA through .   Two crumpled SWAT officers were by the door , heads resting against one another . < nl > ProtagonistD was dressed in black , riot police like clothes , a small handgun clenched in one hand .   Silently , ProtagonistD pulled ProtagonistA down the hall , into a stairwell , and down they went .    ProtagonistA ProtagonistA , ProtagonistD 'm so glad ProtagonistA called .  < nl > Lucy , concious of ProtagonistA's knife - and ProtagonistA's dirty pyjamas - said nothing .   ProtagonistA did n't know what to do , whether to trust ProtagonistD .   ProtagonistA had no other choice . < nl >  ProtagonistA 're a medical marvel , ProtagonistA .   ProtagonistD have some doctors ProtagonistD want ProtagonistA to meet .    ProtagonistD paused by the door to the basement , looked ProtagonistA up and down , and pulled ProtagonistA into a quick hug .    Come on , we 've got work to do .  < eos > 
< sos > The creature was small and delicate , with spindly limbs covered in thin white hairs . ProtagonistA was frozen in place . < nl > One of its fingers curled , and its round head bobbed insistently . It was beckoning to ProtagonistA ; as ProtagonistA's heart fluttered nervously , ProtagonistA leaned forward until they were nose to nose . It grasped at the fabric of ProtagonistA's space suit and pulled ProtagonistA closer , bringing its mouth to ProtagonistA's ear . < nl > And then its hand whipped out , a finger jabbed ProtagonistA in the chest , and it said ,  ProtagonistA 're it .  The creature giggled like a child , scurrying away with its head wobbling back and forth . < nl > Standing there with ProtagonistA's mouth parted , ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistA's chance at world - renowned achievement skip through an alien wilderness . ProtagonistA came to a sudden , irrational decision : ProtagonistA had to chase after it . < nl > The oxygen levels were just high enough to support a little bit of running , so ProtagonistA tossed aside ProtagonistA's space helmet and dove into the forest of red vines . As ProtagonistA plunged deeper and deeper into the planet , dust swirled around each step and left dented footprints in the sandy dirt . ProtagonistA was following its path of bird - like tracks , stopping every so often to catch ProtagonistA's breath or get ProtagonistA's bearings . < nl > When ProtagonistA finally found the creature , it was curled into a ball , staring out at ProtagonistA with wide eyes . ProtagonistA grabbed it roughly by the elbow , and it shrieked in delight . < nl >  Say it ,  it told ProtagonistA .  Say it , say it !  < nl > ProtagonistA raised an eyebrow at it , cheeks flushed from exertion .  We 're not playing games , you extraterrestrial bobble head .  < nl > It gave ProtagonistA a look of innocent confusion .  I 'm it ?  < nl > ProtagonistA dragged the little alien back through the forest , and hacked at vines the whole way ; the creature was oddly quiet . When they reached the shuttle , it began to scrabble at the ground . Its fingers and toes clutched at the dust , leaving claw marks in the sand . < nl > The color drained from its face .  No thank ProtagonistA ,  it said shrilly .  No ! No thank ProtagonistA !  It squirmed and kicked against ProtagonistA , hissing and biting , before suddenly going silent again . < nl >  Crap ,  said ProtagonistA , feeling for a heartbeat . They were , after all , fragile - looking creatures , and ProtagonistA was afraid ProtagonistA 'd strangled it on accident . < nl > A finger darted up and poked ProtagonistA in the nose .  ProtagonistA 're it !  And off it scampered , over the shuttle and into the tunnels behind it . ProtagonistA raced after it . < nl > ProtagonistA's radio buzzed , and a grainy voice came through :  Where are ProtagonistA , dammit ? Over .  < nl >  Busy ,  ProtagonistA answered through gritted teeth .  Over .  < nl >  For Christ 's sake , ProtagonistA , we thought something took ProtagonistA . Why the hell did n't ProtagonistA answer ? Over .  < nl > ProtagonistA stumbled on a purple root , falling soundly into the hard rock of the tunnel . < nl >  ProtagonistA ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA found something .  There was a slickness to the rock that made climbing difficult -- ProtagonistA's knuckles were white as they gripped the cracks and crevices . < nl >  We need ProtagonistA back at the lab . Over .  < nl > A chittering noise came from ProtagonistA's right , and ProtagonistA's head moved to follow the sound . Then ProtagonistA heard the tell - tale giggle .  Quiet ,  ProtagonistA whispered into the radio . < nl >  Sarah--  < nl > The quiet laughter stopped .  Crap !  < nl >  Are ProtagonistA okay ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA lost it again .  ProtagonistA sighed .  Look , ProtagonistA 've got to catch this thing . ProtagonistA 'll be back later . Over and out .  ProtagonistA switched the radio off . < nl > And then ProtagonistA followed the alien through the tunnels . It is likely that ProtagonistA and the alien have played that game a long , long time , because not a soul heard from ProtagonistA ever again . < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA was so used to the creatures crowding ProtagonistA's vision , ProtagonistA rarely gave them a second glance anymore . < nl > Giant hulking rabbit with four eyes and wings , dragons that wheeled over the cities , massive , slick sea creatures that gamboled and played in the rivers and oceans . ProtagonistA was n't able to touch them , and they never seemed to see ProtagonistA - but they were always something that was uniquely ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA wrote stories about them , but never showed ProtagonistA's writing to anyone . That would make the creatures real to others , and they were * ProtagonistA * . Until ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . < nl > ProtagonistB had somehow found the perfect , shifting molten shade of gold to capture the glint of ProtagonistC's folded wings . ProtagonistA ventured closer , certain that ProtagonistB would n't look up at ProtagonistA's approach . ProtagonistB must be one of the ghosts of this shadow world that were n't actually real . < nl > It was probably just ProtagonistA's imagination weaving absurdly vivid pictures , or some delusion . ProtagonistA really should see a professional soon , but it was so lovely to have this ability . What if ProtagonistA were prescribed antipsychotics , and the world became drab and colourless , none of ProtagonistA's creatures to fill the skies and the oceans ? What if ProtagonistA's imagination disappeared too , and ProtagonistA could n't write anymore at all ? ProtagonistA did n't want to let it go . Why , ProtagonistB seemed magical , with ProtagonistB's swirling cloak , and waves of ink black hair like a raven 's wing ... < nl >  Do people in ProtagonistA's realm never greet properly ?  ProtagonistB suddenly spoke softly , pausing where ProtagonistB had been painting ProtagonistC's massive front claw . < nl > ProtagonistA's mouth dropped open , and ProtagonistB smiled widely at ProtagonistA's disbelief . < nl >  Oh , great ,  ProtagonistA muttered .  Auditory hallucinations , too , what fun .  < nl > To prove it , the other people in the park were giving ProtagonistA's nervous looks , as if afraid ProtagonistA would attack them at any moment . ProtagonistB gave a rich chuckle and turned back to ProtagonistB's picture , mixing gold and white to get the colour of ProtagonistC's belly just right . < nl >  Oh , ProtagonistA 're no more ' crazy ' than any of the people in ProtagonistA's world ,  ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA .  Just gifted enough to catch the odd glimpses of the other realms . Where do ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA's greatest artists and writers found their inspiration ? You know , ProtagonistB like ProtagonistA . Do ProtagonistA know the name of ProtagonistB's friend over there ?  < nl > ProtagonistA dismissed the strangeness of the conversation to focus on the question . It seemed vastly important , suddenly , and ProtagonistA found the name as ProtagonistA looked upon ProtagonistC . < nl >  Ryna ,  ProtagonistA said , and ProtagonistB nodded slowly . On the grass , ProtagonistC rolled in ProtagonistC's sleep and gave a soft rumble . < nl >  Good guess . It 's close enough - it seems ProtagonistA 're more in tune with our realm than ProtagonistB thought ,  ProtagonistB said .  Look , ProtagonistC almost heard ProtagonistA . Names are important , ProtagonistA , remember that . It 's the call between realms . What is ProtagonistA ?  < nl >  Sophie ,  ProtagonistA said , without thinking , and ProtagonistB's black eyes gleamed brightly .  What 's ProtagonistA ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB echoed ProtagonistA's name softly , ignoring ProtagonistA's question , and touched ProtagonistA's hand . < nl > ProtagonistA felt it , a warm and fleeting brush of skin .  Well , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB can allow ProtagonistA to become a greater part of our world , if ProtagonistA wish . ProtagonistB can be ProtagonistA's ... guide , as it were . ProtagonistB's realm will unlock ProtagonistA's potential in ... what do ProtagonistA like to do ? Are ProtagonistA a painter , like ProtagonistB , or perhaps ProtagonistA sing ?  < nl >  Well , ProtagonistA do like to write , sometimes ,  ProtagonistA whispered , almost afraid to say it out loud .  But ProtagonistA 'm not any good .  < nl >  Ah , a * writer * . ProtagonistB do love writers . After ProtagonistA visit , ProtagonistA will write like never before ,  ProtagonistB winked at ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB know , ProtagonistB 've seen it happen . ProtagonistB 've taken some from ProtagonistA's realm before . ProtagonistD was one of our most famous visitors , and a dear friend to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistD ... it 's funny , ProtagonistD was always able to see ProtagonistB , you know . Never got ProtagonistB's name quite right , though , no matter how many times ProtagonistB told ProtagonistD .  < nl > ProtagonistB lapsed into a thoughtful silence . < nl >  But there is danger , too , ProtagonistB wo n't lie , and perhaps ProtagonistA will curse ProtagonistB for drawing ProtagonistA in ,  ProtagonistB continued slowly .  But perhaps ProtagonistA 'll enjoy it , it 's always so difficult to know how one of ProtagonistA will react . Perhaps ProtagonistA are strong enough . Call on ProtagonistB if ProtagonistA wish for it . But remember - with every visit , ProtagonistA will become more removed from ProtagonistA's own plane . It could become difficult to fully return . Some have lost themselves along the way .  < nl >  This is n't real , is it ?  ProtagonistA asked , as ProtagonistB turned ProtagonistB's back on ProtagonistA and finished the painting . < nl >  ProtagonistB see ProtagonistA need convincing ,  ProtagonistB chuckled , and took the painting from the easel . The fresh paint gleamed and the colours seemed to shift , unnaturally bright in the afternoon sun . ProtagonistB handed it to ProtagonistA with a strange little grin . < nl >  Here , a little memento from ProtagonistB , it will prove how real ProtagonistB am . And ProtagonistB 'll give ProtagonistA another gift : the name 's Nevamor . Call on ProtagonistB if ProtagonistA wish , ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistB will visit again . Think it over well .  < nl > ProtagonistA walked home in a daze , staring at the picture of the sleeping dragon sprawled on the grass . It was an almost perfect rendition of ProtagonistC . Ryna . < nl > ProtagonistA's roommate , Elizabeth , frowned when ProtagonistA let ProtagonistA into the apartment . As always , ProtagonistA looked like ProtagonistA was tripping on five kinds of drugs . < nl >  Hey . ProtagonistA ok ?  ProtagonistE asked ProtagonistA . < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm fine ,  ProtagonistA sighed , putting the picture on the coffee table . < nl > ProtagonistA would make an appointment to see a psychiatrist this week , ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistA . Hallucinating the feel and touch of ProtagonistB's hand and a whole painting was becoming less harmless and more frightening . It would be best if ProtagonistA just tried to forget about all of it , and never called ProtagonistB's name . That would just indulge ProtagonistA's delusions . < nl >  Well , ok . ProtagonistE 'm going out , there 's leftovers in the fridge ,  ProtagonistE said , heading to the door .  Nice painting , by the way . Where 'd ProtagonistA get it ?  < nl > ProtagonistA was staring at ProtagonistE , eyes stretched wide in shock . ProtagonistE shrugged and headed out , shaking ProtagonistE's head a bit at ProtagonistA's behaviour . < nl > Hours later , when ProtagonistA returned to an empty apartment , ProtagonistA tried not to worry - even though ProtagonistA had promised ProtagonistA 'd be home tonight . ProtagonistA's roommate had always been a rather odd one , and liked to wander off on ProtagonistA's own . ProtagonistA would be fine , wherever ProtagonistA was . < nl > On the windowsill , a raven ProtagonistA could n't see gave a cawing laugh ProtagonistA never heard . < nl > -------- < nl > [ * * Part Two added here.**](https://www.reddit.com / r / Inkfinger / comments/6ntlb4 / ever_since_you_were_a_kid_you_were_able_to_see/ ) < nl > Hope you enjoyed ProtagonistB's story !

< sos > ProtagonistA wiped ProtagonistA's brow on ProtagonistA's sleeve and put another batch of donuts in the oven . During the summer it got so hot inside the little shop that ProtagonistA could soon bake on the counter . This was the opening day of ProtagonistA's store and ProtagonistA was already growing dizzy . ProtagonistA looked over and saw that ProtagonistB was waiting . < nl >  Just a minute !  ProtagonistA called out and tried to straighten out ProtagonistA's wrinkly apron .  Hi , welcome to Mana & Other Sweet Things ! What can ProtagonistA get ProtagonistB ?  < nl > ProtagonistB looked very different from the peasants that had visited ProtagonistA's shop earlier . ProtagonistB wore a long black robe , despite the hot weather , and ProtagonistB's pale face was partially covered by the shade of a cloak . With a bony hand , ProtagonistB put a white lock of hair behind ProtagonistB's ear , revealing three golden hoops in ProtagonistB's earlobe . < nl >  ProtagonistB 'm looking for something sweet ,  ProtagonistB said ,  Something to get the necromancy flowing .  < nl >  Well , ProtagonistB 've come to the right place then !  < nl >  How much does it cost ?  ProtagonistB said and fumbled with ProtagonistB's gold pouch . < nl >  That depends on what you 'd like .  < nl > ProtagonistB's forehead rippled in furrows . ProtagonistB touched ProtagonistB's chin and sighed . < nl >  Do ProtagonistA have any donuts ?  ProtagonistB said , and tilted ProtagonistB's head forward , looking at ProtagonistA intently . < nl >  Of course ,  ProtagonistA chimed .  They 're ProtagonistA's specialty .  < nl >  Can ProtagonistB have a taste before ProtagonistB decide ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA usually do n't do tastings .  < nl >  Then how can ProtagonistB know if it 's good ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA suppose ProtagonistB 're right ,  ProtagonistA said and cut out a piece of donut and handed it over on a paper plate . < nl >  Oh , yes ,  ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistB's gray eyes lighting up .  This is it ; this is what ProtagonistB 've been looking for !  < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm glad ProtagonistB liked it ,  ProtagonistA said , smiling . < nl >  No , ProtagonistA do n't understand ,  ProtagonistB said , flapping ProtagonistB's arms .  This is it ! This is the one ! ProtagonistA are the one !  < nl >  What ?  ProtagonistA said with a laugh . < nl > ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's donuts were good , but ProtagonistA had never before seen anyone become so ecstatic . < nl >  ProtagonistA 're the only hope for humanity ,  ProtagonistB said sweat dripping down ProtagonistB's forehead .  ProtagonistB 've traveled land and sea to find ProtagonistA .  < nl >  Okay , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said and helped ProtagonistB to a chair .  It 's probably best if ProtagonistB sit down , the heat must 've gotten to ProtagonistB . Here , have a glass of water .  < nl > ProtagonistB drank deeply .  ProtagonistB 'm telling ProtagonistA ; people will come and when they do ProtagonistA have a choice-  < nl > At that very moment , the doorbell chimed and three other robed figures entered . The tallest one , a man with a beard and round glasses , spoke first . < nl >  We 've traveled far !  < nl >  Oh , how far we 've traveled !  the man with the square - shaped glasses muttered without enthusiasm .  Very , very , veeeeeeeeeeery far .  < nl > ProtagonistA felt a jolt in ProtagonistA's chest . ProtagonistB looked ProtagonistA in the eyes . < nl >  Remember what ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said and hurried out of the store . < nl > ProtagonistC walked up to the counter and spoke for the first time . < nl >  ProtagonistC 've never seen such a well - organized pastry shop before ...  ProtagonistC said .  Utterly top notch , it 's like ProtagonistC 've walked into the royal bakery and the king himself had organized it .  < nl > Another jolt surged through ProtagonistA's body .  Yes , ProtagonistA 'm sorry - ProtagonistA opened just this morning - ProtagonistA have n't had time to put prices on everything yet .  < nl >  ProtagonistC 'll have one of those !  ProtagonistC said and pointed at a carrot - cake cupcake .  That is if ProtagonistC can afford it - who knows , that piece of pastry might be more expensive than Archmage Ruttersmore 's cross - eyed cluck - duck . There 's no real way of knowing , is there ?  < nl >  It 's two silver pieces , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said as ProtagonistA's face flushed , and newfound power flowed through ProtagonistA . < nl >  Well , ProtagonistA guess they 're about the same price ...  < nl > If ProtagonistA wanted , ProtagonistA now felt like ProtagonistA had the power to throw these schmucks to the other side of the city . ProtagonistA had never wanted to be a big mage - all ProtagonistA wanted to do was bake - so when ProtagonistA's time had come , ProtagonistA had picked the most stupid source of power that ProtagonistA could think of . So that ProtagonistA would be left alone . < nl >  We know who ProtagonistA are , ProtagonistA . The council sent us here to test ProtagonistA's powers . Now if ProtagonistA would be so kind to come with us - ProtagonistA 're the first person to choose sarcasm as their source - and we need to bring ProtagonistA in for ...  < nl >  Further experiments ,  his companion filled in . < nl >  Well , it 'd be such a delight to accompany you , ProtagonistA 'll come right away ,  ProtagonistA said and flicked ProtagonistA's wrist . < nl > The three wizards landed on their butts on the street outside . < nl >  And ProtagonistA 'd just loooove to be experimented on a bit ,  ProtagonistA continued .    You 're welcome back * anytime * you want !  < nl > ProtagonistA's powers at an all - time high , ProtagonistA placed the strongest sanctuary spell ever seen in the twelve kingdoms on ProtagonistA's little bakery . The wooden walls glowed with magical energy . Spent , ProtagonistA sat down behind the counter . Nobody that ProtagonistA did n't want inside would able to enter , not even the Archmage 's golden cluck - duck . And to top it off , the sanctuary spell had a built - in AC . < nl > * * * * * < nl > Subscribe to r / Lilwa_Dexel for more stories . < eos > 
< sos >  Sarah ?  asked ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's mouth was dry and ProtagonistA's heart beat like a gavel in ProtagonistA's ears . Every time , the anticipation - * the hope * - swallowed ProtagonistA up and allowed ProtagonistA to imagine ProtagonistB was back . Then , it would chew ProtagonistA up and spit ProtagonistA out , and ProtagonistA would feel the same terrible things as when ProtagonistA 'd found ProtagonistB's body in the bathroom . < nl > It took ProtagonistB a moment to realise ProtagonistB had returned . ProtagonistB craned ProtagonistB's neck up to look for ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA stood at the end of the table , ProtagonistA's lips trembling , and ProtagonistA's pale face wearing a smile that was at the same time hopeful and utterly desperate . It pained ProtagonistB to see ProtagonistA like this . < nl >  ProtagonistB 'm sorry , James .  < nl >  ProtagonistB ...  ProtagonistA whispered , as ProtagonistA slumped down against a bookshelf .  It 's ProtagonistB again ...  < nl > ProtagonistB's arms gained feeling before ProtagonistB's legs ; one at a time , ProtagonistB threw ProtagonistB's thighs off the table and , using ProtagonistB's legs as anchors , sat up .   ProtagonistA's face was more lined than before and ProtagonistA's hairline had scampered further back . ProtagonistA's eyes were gray and hollow . ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistA was the most tortured soul ProtagonistB 'd ever seen . < nl > ProtagonistB turned ProtagonistB's head slowly and looked about the basement ; the bookshelves held many new black tomes , thick and weathered . There were both more crosses and pentagrams dotted around the room - more of ProtagonistA's wife 's old dresses , too . Then , ProtagonistB saw the mirror and let out a gasp . < nl > ProtagonistA looked up .  Are ProtagonistB okay , ProtagonistB ?  < nl >  Where ... where did ProtagonistB get the body from ?  ProtagonistB gently touched ProtagonistB's face , running a finger down the smooth curves of ProtagonistB's cheeks . < nl >  Oh . ProtagonistB was in a skiing accident . Broke ProtagonistB's neck . ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA paused and frowned ,  ProtagonistB did n't think ProtagonistA killed ProtagonistB , did ProtagonistB ?  < nl >  No ! The thought never crossed ProtagonistB's mind ,  ProtagonistB lied . < nl >  Good . Because , ProtagonistB know ProtagonistA better than that by now , ProtagonistA think .  < nl >  Of course . It 's just ProtagonistB was taken back ... * ProtagonistB 's so beautiful * .  < nl > ProtagonistA nodded .  ProtagonistA think Sarah would have been happy with it .  < nl > ProtagonistB nodded .  ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB began , reaching down and stretching ProtagonistB's legs out ,  ProtagonistA ca n't keep doing this .  < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm * so * close , ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA even know where ProtagonistA went wrong - next time ProtagonistA 'll get it !  < nl > ProtagonistB sighed .  ProtagonistA , listen to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB 's not coming back .  < nl >  ProtagonistB 're wrong !  ProtagonistA snapped .  ProtagonistA just need to keep going . ProtagonistA need to keep trying .  < nl > ProtagonistB saw tears welling in ProtagonistA's eyes , and felt a warm wetness running down ProtagonistB's own cheeks . ProtagonistB could n't stand it any longer . It would hurt ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB had to do it . ProtagonistB had to put an end to this - for ProtagonistB's sake , and for ProtagonistA . < nl >  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA know how ProtagonistB died .  < nl >  Yes , of course .   ProtagonistB was murdered - and ProtagonistA was n't there to protect ProtagonistB .  < nl >  ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB in the bath .  < nl >  They slit ProtagonistB's wrists ,  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's face blank and ProtagonistA's voice suddenly void of emotion . < nl >  * ProtagonistB * slit ProtagonistB's wrists .  < nl >  No . That 's not what happened .  < nl >  ProtagonistB 've spoken to ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA . Many times .  < nl >  * What ? *  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's eyes widening and ProtagonistA's teeth clenching together .  Why would n't ProtagonistB have told ProtagonistA that before !  < nl >  ProtagonistB did n't want to tell ProtagonistA because , ProtagonistB thought it would hurt ProtagonistA too much .  < nl > ProtagonistA paused for a moment .  When ProtagonistB go back , ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB to find ProtagonistB . Tell ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA 'll find a way to bring ProtagonistB here . Tell ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA love ProtagonistB .  < nl >  ProtagonistB loves ProtagonistA too , ProtagonistA .  < nl >  ProtagonistA know ,  ProtagonistA whispered . < nl >  But ProtagonistB does n't want to come back . ProtagonistB ca n't . ProtagonistB chose to leave the world , not just you . Trying to force ProtagonistB back , because ProtagonistA miss ProtagonistB ... it 's ... it 's just selfish .  < nl >  Go back ,  ProtagonistA said , getting up from the floor .  Go back , before ProtagonistA send ProtagonistB back ProtagonistA .  Both ProtagonistA's arms and voice were trembling . < nl >  Please , ProtagonistA .  < nl >  Go back !  ProtagonistA screamed , running to a shelf and snatching a knife .  Or ProtagonistA swear to God ...  < nl > ProtagonistB swallowed . ProtagonistB forced ProtagonistB off the table and began walking toward ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB * had * to get to ProtagonistA , to make ProtagonistA see - but ProtagonistB only managed a single step before ProtagonistB's legs gave way and ProtagonistB fell to the cold , concrete floor . ProtagonistB's head bounced off the ground and pain shot through ProtagonistB's body . < nl > ProtagonistA walked over to ProtagonistB , knife in hand . ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistB over ; blood dribbled out of ProtagonistB's forehead , dyeing ProtagonistB's blonde hair a sticky strawberry . < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said . < nl >  Please ... do n't bring ProtagonistB back anymore ,  ProtagonistB said , as the knife hung over ProtagonistB's chest .  Let this be the end .  < nl > There was something new in ProtagonistB's voice - or maybe it was in ProtagonistB's eyes - that surprised ProtagonistA . It was something * familiar * . < nl >  Sarah ?  ProtagonistA whispered as ProtagonistA's face grew pale . < nl > The blade rested above ProtagonistB for a few seconds , swaying back and forth like a pendulum . ProtagonistB thrust ProtagonistB's arms up and grabbed hold of ProtagonistA's hands ; ProtagonistB forced them down , plunging the knife deep into ProtagonistB's chest . < nl > ProtagonistB could feel ProtagonistB's life slipping away . Somewhere far in the distance , ProtagonistB could hear ProtagonistA screaming - * begging * . < nl >  Goodbye , baby ,  ProtagonistB said , as the light dwindled to darkness . < nl > --- < nl > /r / nickofnight < eos > 
< sos > Their parents tell them that they 're too young to wander off by themselves . ProtagonistA does n't look too young though , ProtagonistA looks really big ever since ProtagonistA woke up . It 's neat , everyone thinks ProtagonistA 's a grown up now and that means ProtagonistA can do lots of things ProtagonistA could n't before without anyone shouting . Mummy and Daddy still shout because they know ProtagonistA 's not really a grown up , but nobody else can tell . < nl > It 's really helpful because it means ProtagonistA can show ProtagonistB what a cool older sister ProtagonistA is . ProtagonistB is only little ; ProtagonistB was n't even in Mummy 's tummy when ProtagonistA went to sleep . ProtagonistA really wants ProtagonistB to be ProtagonistA's friend so ProtagonistA thinks ProtagonistA 'll take ProtagonistB to do a big girl thing together - something ProtagonistB could n't do if ProtagonistA were still asleep . < nl > They leave the garden quietly and start walking hand in hand . It 's not hard to find the mall , ProtagonistA is really good at reading and there are signs all the way from the main road near the house right up to the mall car park . It takes a long time , hours and hours , and their feet hurt when they arrive . They go inside and look in all the shops and have a really good time even though they ca n't buy anything . Nobody asks them where their parents are all day . Nobody thinks to stop them . Why would they ? < nl > There are n't any signs leading from the mall to the house . < eos > 
< sos > Hi ! I 'm new to Writing Prompts and I 'd appreciate any feedback you 're willing to give ! < nl > -------------------- < nl > ProtagonistA pulled ProtagonistA's clothes tightly across ProtagonistA's shoulders and looked down . All ProtagonistA wanted to do was pay for ProtagonistA's groceries . But no ; They had to ask . Everytime . Every . Single . Time . < nl >  ProtagonistA got any clue what it means yet ?  ProtagonistB , asked . < nl > ProtagonistA quickly took a swig of water .  Hmm ?  ProtagonistA hummed , desperately digging for ProtagonistA's credit card . Of course , ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistB was asking about . ProtagonistA had told them that ProtagonistA had received a tattoo resembling a water bottle . ProtagonistA had n't , but it was easier than telling people that ProtagonistA did n't have any . A tattoo of a water bottle was also strange enough that people would believe ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA did n't know what it meant . < nl > No one in this town could mind their own business . Everywhere ProtagonistA went , ProtagonistA saw burly men proudly displaying their art - filled biceps and speaking stories of heroism . Some of ProtagonistA's friends had  4.0 ,  or images depicting their sleepless nights of studying to pass a class . Others had their current League of Legends ranking proudly displayed . Everyone had something . Except ProtagonistA . < nl > It was n't that ProtagonistA was a bad student , or that ProtagonistA sucked at video games ; it was quite the opposite really . The tattoos were meant to represent a great achievement , and , well , those things did n't cut it for ProtagonistA . < nl >  ProtagonistA's tattoo ,  ProtagonistB leaned closer , eager to hear about ProtagonistA's achievement ,  what does it mean ? ProtagonistC said ProtagonistA got a waterbottle .  < nl > ProtagonistA's lips fell into a scowl . ProtagonistA yearned to return to the days before ProtagonistC got over ProtagonistC's fear of public speaking and received a microphone tattoo on ProtagonistC's throat . ProtagonistC used to be someone ProtagonistA could talk to ; ProtagonistC used to be someone ProtagonistA could trust to tell that ProtagonistA had n't received a tattoo . < nl > Lying to him-- telling ProtagonistC about ProtagonistA's  tattoo  -- was probably one of the hardest things ProtagonistA had done . But it was necessary . At least , that 's what ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA . Nowadays , ProtagonistC could n't keep ProtagonistC's mouth shut . No one in this godforsaken town could . < nl >  No clue ,  ProtagonistA mumbled ,  still figuring it out .  < nl > ProtagonistA handed ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's credit card . In the process , ProtagonistA knocked over ProtagonistA's water bottle , and liquid spilled all over the counter . < nl > ProtagonistA cursed and scanned the room for paper towel . ProtagonistA ran over to the dispenser and got a few sheets . < nl >  No , no ,  ProtagonistB began ,  it 's quite alright . We 'll get it .  < nl >  ProtagonistA got it ,  ProtagonistA insisted ,  and , hey , who knows , this could be what ProtagonistA's tattoo is for : cleaning up after ProtagonistA's mistakes .  ProtagonistA laughed bitterly . < nl > There was more water spillage than ProtagonistA initially thought . And it was n't just over the counter ; ProtagonistA somehow managed to spray water onto ProtagonistB's  employee of the month  tattoo across ProtagonistB's forearm . < nl > ProtagonistA cursed again .  Sorry . Let me help ProtagonistB with that .  < nl >  Seriously ,  ProtagonistB cleared ProtagonistB's throat and backed away . < nl >  No , really , it 's ok ,  ProtagonistA said as ProtagonistA grabbed ProtagonistB's wrist and wiped ProtagonistB's arm with the towel . As ProtagonistA did so , the white paper towel became streak with green and yellow . < nl > ProtagonistA's eyes widened .  What the ... ?  < nl > Edit : a word < nl > Edit 2 : removed  it was fake  to better flow into part 2 . < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA was in complete shot when ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistB . Halfway across the world here ProtagonistA was , and in the shadows of the Eiffle Tower ProtagonistB reached up to take off ProtagonistB's sunglasses . That 's when ProtagonistA spotted that precious bare skin , like a gift sent down from heaven for ProtagonistA . < nl >  Pardone moi !  ProtagonistA screamed in ProtagonistA's terrible , terrible French and rushed toward ProtagonistB ,  Je suis ... eh ... Tu ...  < nl >  It 's okay , ProtagonistB 'm American ,  ProtagonistB said back with a tone that betrayed nothing if not boredom ,  What is it ?  < nl > American ! It would n't have mattered at all , of course , but knowing that ProtagonistB speaks ProtagonistA's language , knows ProtagonistA's world , it made the entire situation that much sweeter . To top it off , ProtagonistB was gorgeous , easily more gorgeous than any woman ProtagonistA 'd seen in years . < nl >  ProtagonistB's wrist !  ProtagonistA immediately fumbled out , pointing toward ProtagonistB's arm ,  ProtagonistB do n't have one either ! ProtagonistA 've never seen anyone else that did n't have it !  < nl >  Ha , good one ,  ProtagonistB shot back as ProtagonistB dismissively waved ProtagonistB's arm toward ProtagonistA's own wrist . Of course ProtagonistA was far too nervous , ProtagonistA should have told ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA draw ProtagonistA on . < nl >  No , no !  ProtagonistA stuttered out , holding up ProtagonistA's wrist ,  This thing ? This thing is--  < nl >  Fake , right ? ProtagonistA draw it on ? Or no , wait , it 's a stamp ? Yeah , yeah . ProtagonistB 've heard 'em all .  < nl >  What ?  ProtagonistA said back , confused . < nl >  Listen ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 're not the first guy to try this , and ProtagonistB 'm not interested . ProtagonistB 'm not some one - night stand , ProtagonistA , and the fact that ProtagonistB 'm destined to look around for anybody out there who may or may not exist does n't have ProtagonistB too excited to play these stupid little pick - up games .  < nl >  No ! ProtagonistA promise ProtagonistB  ProtagonistA hurriedly yelled out ,  Just look , ProtagonistA 'll wash it off ! Come with ProtagonistA , there 's a cafe around the corner and watch ProtagonistA wash it off !  < nl >  Riiiight , cafe around the corner . ProtagonistA do n't quit , do ProtagonistA ? Well ProtagonistA do ,  ProtagonistA finished and briskly walked off . ProtagonistA tried to chase after , but in moments ProtagonistA flooded into a crowd and disappeared . < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA was n't the only one who refused ProtagonistA's words , of course . But most people eventually said them after a few centuries , driven by boredom or heartache or apathy . Or pain . < nl > You could suffer in pain for eternity , but still you would live , unless you said the words . Others insisted you simply came to long for proper rest , or so ProtagonistA had been told . But ProtagonistA never had . ProtagonistA was approaching 750 , and ProtagonistA had never grown tired of life . ProtagonistA privately believed that was why the Gods had given ProtagonistA the words ProtagonistA had known since birth : a curse to balance ProtagonistA's never - ending hunger for life . < nl > Today , ProtagonistA was choking on them . < nl > ProtagonistA considered ProtagonistB's face , tight with pain as ProtagonistB laboured for breath . Before long , ProtagonistB would be too far gone to hear and understand what ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistB might become one of the countless withered bodies that never left the state facilities dedicated to such cases . Too delirious to remember ProtagonistB's words , ProtagonistB would hang in limbo for eternity . ProtagonistC was nearly there already . And ProtagonistA owed ProtagonistC the words , even though ProtagonistC had never demanded them . ProtagonistA owed ProtagonistC everything . < nl > The window was open , and ProtagonistA stepped closer to take a breath of the crisp night air , smiling at the twin moons that winked at ProtagonistA from the sky . It was a lovely planet , newly opened for habitation . They had meant to spent at least a century here , but life happens . Death happens . < nl > Any minute now , a nurse would come for the nightly check - up . They would be done before then . < nl >  ProtagonistA love ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistA told ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA's last and most vibrant of partners , wasted almost beyond recognition now . The bones of ProtagonistC's once full cheeks were jutting out . ProtagonistA smiled to see ProtagonistC's eyes flutter open , to catch one more glimpse of those luminous blue eyes . The rest of ProtagonistC had faded , but never those eyes . < nl > ProtagonistC grasped ProtagonistA's hands , a surprisingly strong grip . ProtagonistA laboured for breath ProtagonistA now , as ProtagonistC groped for ProtagonistC's words . ProtagonistA's heart leapt as ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC smile , that same teasing smile ProtagonistC had given ProtagonistA so many times during the past two centuries . Whenever ProtagonistC hugged ProtagonistA and kissed ProtagonistA's neck , or presented ProtagonistA with flowers after ProtagonistA had done some small thing for ProtagonistC . Whenever ProtagonistC wanted to say ProtagonistC's own words , but could n't . < nl >  Thank ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC breathed , and silence reigned as a chill wind swept through the room . ProtagonistC was coming , but ProtagonistA was n't worried . < nl > ProtagonistA was n't alone . < nl > --------- < nl > Hope you enjoyed my story ! You can find more of my work on /r / Inkfinger/. < eos > 
< sos >  Who are ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB yelled at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB raised a hand to ProtagonistB's eyes and squinted , trying to get a better look at ProtagonistA - trying to decide if ProtagonistB should grab ProtagonistC's hand and run far away from here , never turning , never looking back . But ProtagonistB knew they could n't run . They 'd * probably * die if they stayed , but ProtagonistB was certain they would die if they ran . It had been so long since they 'd seen someone else - * anyone * else . ProtagonistB had thought they were the last . < nl > ProtagonistA was tall - even hunched over as ProtagonistA was , struggling to walk , ProtagonistB guessed ProtagonistA must have been at least seven foot . ProtagonistA clutched something long and curved in ProtagonistA's right hand . < nl >  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistD is scared ,  whispered ProtagonistC , clutching ProtagonistD tightly in the crook of ProtagonistC's good arm . < nl > ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistC , sighed , then crouched down until ProtagonistB was eye level with ProtagonistC . Sweat was pouring out from ProtagonistC's burning forehead and dribbling down to ProtagonistC's torn , lilac tee . It was a sweat that they could n't replace ; there was no water here . There seemed to be no water left on Earth . ProtagonistB gently ran the back of ProtagonistB's fingers down ProtagonistC's cheek . < nl >  ProtagonistB too , ProtagonistC . But we all need to be brave right now . Whoever is coming , we need their help .   ProtagonistC 're still not better - although , ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistC will be soon ,  ProtagonistB added ,  and , well , we 've not seen * anyone * since ...    ProtagonistB's voice trailed off as ProtagonistB thought of their parents . < nl > ProtagonistC bit ProtagonistC's lip , looked up at the swirling , tombstone sky above and nodded .  We 'll be brave .  < nl >  Good girl . Make sure ProtagonistC stay behind ProtagonistB , okay ? Let ProtagonistB talk to ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB commanded , stepping in front of ProtagonistC .  And if ... anything happens to ProtagonistB . Anything bad , ProtagonistB want ProtagonistC to run as fast as ProtagonistC can , back the way we came .  ProtagonistB turned to face ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB could now make out the ragged cloak that hung loose around the thin body ; the pointed blade that trailed on the desert floor , biting into the earth as it dragged along . But ProtagonistB could n't see the features of the face hidden in the brooding shadow of the hood . < nl >  Hello !  said ProtagonistB , raising a hand . ProtagonistA did n't respond ; ProtagonistA continued trudging toward them . < nl >  We- we do n't mean ProtagonistA harm . ProtagonistC's 's sick and we 've not had water for-  < nl > ProtagonistB's mouth dropped open when ProtagonistB saw the skeletal feet poking out from the bottom of the cloak .  Oh , Jesus .  Now ProtagonistB was ready to run . ProtagonistB 'd rather die on the radiation plains , ProtagonistB's skin peeling and ProtagonistB's heart dripping , than let ProtagonistA come any closer . But ProtagonistB's curiosity had never been greater ; it took hold of ProtagonistB's body and froze it in place . < nl >  * What the fuck are ProtagonistA ? *  ProtagonistB mouthed . < nl > ProtagonistA stopped a few feet from ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA tilted ProtagonistA's head to the side , raised a bony hand to ProtagonistA's face and peeled back ProtagonistA's hood . < nl >  * Oh , shit . * ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistB said , as ProtagonistB reached behind ProtagonistB , fumbling for ProtagonistC's hand ,  get ready to run . Okay ?  < nl >  Pleaaase ,  came the terrible , pleading voice ; it sounded as if it was being dragged through broken glass , as it rose up through ProtagonistA's throat . < nl > ProtagonistC poked ProtagonistC's head out from behind ProtagonistB . ProtagonistC gasped . < nl >  Pleaaase ,  came the voice again . ProtagonistA raised a hand , ProtagonistA's fingers reaching toward them . Then , ProtagonistA collapsed onto ProtagonistA's knees , ProtagonistA's scythe dropping to the ground . < nl >  Let 's go , okay ProtagonistC ?  said ProtagonistB , trying not to show the fear in ProtagonistB's voice . < nl >  ... we ca n't go . ProtagonistC think ProtagonistA needs our help ,  said ProtagonistC .  ProtagonistA 's in pain .  < nl >  Izzy ! What are ProtagonistC doing ?  ProtagonistB hissed , as ProtagonistC slowly walked toward ProtagonistA , until ProtagonistC stood only a foot away from ProtagonistA . < nl >  ProtagonistC's name is Izzy ,  ProtagonistC said , before bursting into a cough that ripped ProtagonistC's throat and tore at ProtagonistC's lungs .   It took ProtagonistC a moment to recover ; ProtagonistC wiped the blood from ProtagonistC's lips onto ProtagonistC's arm .  This - this is Cibby , and that 's ProtagonistC's brother Michael ,  said ProtagonistC .  We do n't have any water , but we have a little food . Would ProtagonistC like some ?  < nl > ProtagonistA stared at ProtagonistC for a moment , before , with what looked like great effort , stretched a hand out toward ProtagonistC . < nl >  Do n't !  shouted ProtagonistB , but it was too late . ProtagonistC had already taken the pale hand in ProtagonistC . < nl > It took only a second for ProtagonistC to fall limply to the ground , ProtagonistD by ProtagonistC's side . < nl >  ProtagonistC !  ProtagonistB screamed , running toward ProtagonistC and skidding to the ground next to ProtagonistC .  Oh God , ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistB said , as snot and hot tears mixed in ProtagonistB's mouth . ProtagonistC's eyes were shut and ProtagonistC's chest was perfectly still .  Please do n't be dead . * Please please please . *  ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistC gently at first , then more firmly , then urgently . But ProtagonistC did n't respond . ProtagonistC did n't move . < nl > ProtagonistB picked up ProtagonistD , and placed ProtagonistD into ProtagonistC's limp , open hand . Then , ProtagonistB buried ProtagonistB's head into ProtagonistC's chest and wept . < nl > ProtagonistA slowly got back to ProtagonistA's feet . ProtagonistA bent down and picked up ProtagonistA's scythe . < nl >  What did ProtagonistA do to ProtagonistC , you- you * monster ! *  ProtagonistB asked , ProtagonistB's voice trembling as ProtagonistB turned to ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistC was just a little girl and you-  < nl > ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistC's left arm move first . The arm that had n't moved since the mines . < nl >  * What ? * ProtagonistC ?  < nl > ProtagonistC's eyes slowly opened . The trace of a smile curved over ProtagonistC's lips . < nl >  ProtagonistC !  ProtagonistB repeated through sobs and laughter .  Oh God , ProtagonistC , ProtagonistC 're alive . Please - * please , * do n't ever do that to ProtagonistB again .  ProtagonistB kissed ProtagonistC's cheeks a dozen times , and ProtagonistC's forehead nearer a hundred , before hugging ProtagonistC tightly . < nl >  ProtagonistB ... ProtagonistB made ProtagonistC better ,  ProtagonistC said , as ProtagonistB finally released ProtagonistC , raising ProtagonistC's neck and looking up at ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistC stared anew at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA looked stronger now . Taller , too . It took ProtagonistC a few moments to be able to whisper :  * thank ProtagonistA * .  < nl > ProtagonistA nodded , before lifting ProtagonistA's scythe high into the air . < nl >  What are ProtagonistA ...  < nl > ProtagonistA brought the instrument down fiercely , tip first , burying it deep into the dry earth . A fountain of clear liquid erupted from the hole as ProtagonistA withdrew it . It did n't take long for a soft blanket of grass to begin sprouting underneath ProtagonistC , quickly spreading out as if it was a puddle of water . It did n't take long for ProtagonistC to find the first tulip that had grown in a hundred years . Then , the first apple tree . < nl > ProtagonistC whispered to ProtagonistB and pressed something into ProtagonistB's hands . < nl > When ProtagonistA was finally satisfied by the sparkling oasis , ProtagonistA pointed a finger toward ProtagonistB and gestured for ProtagonistB to step forward . ProtagonistB did so . < nl >  ProtagonistC wanted ProtagonistA to have ProtagonistD ,  ProtagonistB said , offering out a hand . < nl > ProtagonistA paused for a moment , unsure , before reaching out and taking ProtagonistD . ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistD curiously , turning ProtagonistD over twice . Then , ProtagonistA dropped ProtagonistD into a deep , dark pocket on the side of ProtagonistA's cloak .  There are others ,  ProtagonistA said , in a soft rumble .  Only a few . ProtagonistB must bring them here .  < nl >  How - how will ProtagonistB find them ?  < nl >  ProtagonistB will ,  ProtagonistA replied .  ProtagonistC will be safe , here . Nothing evil can step foot into ProtagonistA's garden .  ProtagonistA turned and took three steps away from ProtagonistB , before pausing .  ProtagonistA will see ProtagonistB again , someday ,  ProtagonistA whispered , not quite loud enough for ProtagonistC to hear . Then , ProtagonistA continued ProtagonistA's slow walk into the dancing dust of the desert . < nl >  Thank ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB whispered , as ProtagonistA drifted out of sight . < nl > --- < nl > more on /r / nickofnight < eos > 
< sos > They packed and left once more . < nl > ProtagonistA sighed as they did it , looking back from the ramp at the gold - green horizon , pierced all through with falling stars , all aflame . The world groaned and hissed . ProtagonistA felt the slateland below ProtagonistA's feet shimmy and quake . < nl > Another home lost . < nl > On the ship , ProtagonistA settled into a corner , not helping , a passive protest of the situation . ProtagonistB set a crate at ProtagonistA's feet . < nl >  Do n't pout . It 's the start of another adventure .  < nl > ProtagonistA shook off ProtagonistB's optimism , diving into the crate .  What 's this ?  ProtagonistA said , pulling up a binder , corroded , yellow and warped . < nl >  Careful ,  said ProtagonistB .  Those are pictures . Old , old pictures .  < nl >  Of * what * ?  said ProtagonistA , flipping open the pages .  What are these things ? < nl > ProtagonistB laughed , settling in beside ProtagonistA .  It 's us . From before .  < nl > ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head .  No it is n't . This is ... ProtagonistA do n't know * what * this is . Look how silly they look . How ... ugly .  < nl > ProtagonistB shrugged .  We did n't think so then .  ProtagonistB pointed at an image .  That 's me .  < nl > ProtagonistA pulled back , staring in disbelief .  No it is n't ! Look at the ... ProtagonistA mean ...  < nl >  This is what we were in the beginning ,  said ProtagonistB .  Those were perfect bodies for Earth . Slim , light , nimble . Adapted to the atmosphere . ProtagonistB miss those bodies sometimes ...  < nl >  What 's wrong with * these * bodies ?  said ProtagonistA , looking down at ProtagonistA . < nl >  Nothing ! Not a thing . But ProtagonistA must remember we 've been so many places , ProtagonistA . And they were all so different . We 've made changes along the way to suit each and every new home . See here ...  < nl > ProtagonistB put a gentle finger on the trio of exposed ridges across ProtagonistA's bare chest .  On Calais - ProtagonistA remember Calais ? - we formed these slits in order to help us breathe . The old way would n't have done . And here ...  < nl > ProtagonistB traced the edge of the thin membranous flap that ran along the length of ProtagonistA's forearm .  There was hardly any solid land on Galway . We had to adapt . We 're always adapting . Even the bare shape of us . The gravity was much , much harsher on Fulsome . We grew stouter because we had to . The old us would 've snapped right in half .  < nl > ProtagonistA nodded . ProtagonistA remembered some of these places , and ProtagonistA supposed ProtagonistA remembered some of these changes , but they had n't felt like changes . Looking back , they seemed a natural progression .  This part looks stupid ,  ProtagonistA said , resting a finger on the part of the image that showed a flowing , black wave riding down from the top of ProtagonistB's head . < nl > Again , ProtagonistB laughed .  It was the style . ProtagonistA's father certainly loved ProtagonistB's long hair , impractical as it may have been .  ProtagonistB touched the silvery , solid webbing that sat like a shield atop ProtagonistA's head .  We could be impractical then , though . The radiation was different . No threat of black flares .  ProtagonistB sighed .  ProtagonistB guess things were a bit simpler then .  < nl >  Better ?  said ProtagonistA . < nl >  No ,  said ProtagonistB , running a loving finger across the outer rim of ProtagonistA's folded wings .  Just different . That 's what comes of survival , ProtagonistB suppose . You must always be willing to become .  < nl >  Become what ?  said ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistB smirked .  Whatever you must .  ProtagonistB took back the binder and set it in the crate .  Back to work , ProtagonistA . This world is no longer ours .  < nl > ProtagonistA staggered up to ProtagonistA's feet .  ProtagonistA hate living out in the black .  < nl >  The black is just an interlude ,  said ProtagonistB .  It reminds us to appreciate those times when we have solid earth to call our own .  < nl > ProtagonistA understood , even if ProtagonistA preferred not to agree . ProtagonistA gathered up the last of ProtagonistA's possessions - the ones that would come with them into the black - and said goodbye to ProtagonistA's dying home . It was sad , but necessary , ProtagonistA realized . That 's just how survival works . < eos > 
< sos > The experiment with ProtagonistB had perhaps gotten out of hand . If any of ProtagonistA's supervisors heard of it , it would be difficult to explain why on earth ProtagonistA found it reasonable to give ProtagonistB impossibly difficult tests while the others were quizzed on only the basic classroom curriculum . < nl > The answer would never suffice , despite its truth : * because ProtagonistB would get them all correct * . < nl > ProtagonistA's minor case study began when ProtagonistA accidentally listed the Second Punic War as the Carthaginian War on ProtagonistA's ninth graders ' tests . Every student understandably missed the question -- few fourteen - year - olds , it seemed , read the * Aeneid * these days and would place Carthage as an ancient African city -- except ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB listed the correct dates in ProtagonistB's blocky , imperfect handwriting . < nl > ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB about it later . < nl > ProtagonistB only shrugged and said ,  ProtagonistB just know a lot of stuff .  ProtagonistB looked uncomfortable and scurried away . < nl > ProtagonistA then started slipping questions into ProtagonistB's tests which none of the children could possibly be expected to answer . Who was involved in the defenestration of Prague ? Which Russian ruler died in 1584 under the title  Tsar of all the Russias  ? What is the cosine of this triangle ? Can ProtagonistB balance this chemical formula ? < nl > ProtagonistA almost wanted to accuse ProtagonistB of cheating . But ProtagonistA kept a razor - sharp eye on ProtagonistB during tests , and ProtagonistB's hands never strayed under the table or into ProtagonistB's pockets . ProtagonistB simply filled out ProtagonistB's test , handed it in halfway through the period , and then sat with ProtagonistB's head on ProtagonistB's desk until ProtagonistB was free to go to ProtagonistB's next class . < nl > Then ProtagonistA perhaps pushed it too far . < nl > Yesterday , ProtagonistA gave all but one of ProtagonistA's students a test on Sophocles 's * Oedipus Rex * , which they were reading as a part of their ancient Greek unit . It asked them the basics of the plot and the play 's intended messages . < nl > For ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB's test was more ... open - ended . < nl > ProtagonistA left a single sticky note on ProtagonistB's test to explain ProtagonistA : * This , * ProtagonistA wrote , * is not a test of ProtagonistB's knowledge but of ProtagonistB's critical thinking . ProtagonistB are an excellent student and ProtagonistA know ProtagonistA do not need to test ProtagonistB's basic comprehension . Have fun and think clearly . * < nl > Now ProtagonistA sat at ProtagonistA's desk in ProtagonistA's apartment living room with a glass of red wine and a stack of tests before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA rifled through until ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB's near the bottom . ProtagonistA's sticky note still remained on ProtagonistB's paper ; ProtagonistB had simply written  Okay :)  on the bottom . < nl > ProtagonistA smiled , despite ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistA only gave ProtagonistB four questions . ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB the choice to answer in the context of the play or to simply derive ProtagonistB's answers from ProtagonistB's own experiences . Credit was not for the accuracy of ProtagonistB's answers but their depth . < nl > * What is good ? * < nl > * What is just ? * < nl > * What is fate ? * < nl > * What is the purpose to life itself ? * < nl > ProtagonistB had n't answered any of them . ProtagonistB's test page was blank , except for an arrow at the bottom , urging ProtagonistA to turn the paper over . < nl > ProtagonistA frowned and did so . On the back ProtagonistA found a dense wall of ProtagonistB's sloppy , childish handwriting . ProtagonistA took a deep sip of wine before reading . < nl > * Respectfully , ProtagonistA , I think ProtagonistA's questions are built up on false assumptions . ProtagonistA 're asking for ice when the world is water and air , always moving and mixing . It 's a singularly human notion to turn ideas into something condensed , portable , and easy to wrap one 's mind around . But it 's not honest . * < nl > * ProtagonistA are asking questions which lack answers because the questions themselves are wrongly put . It is not about rigid , inflexible meaning which exists in its own right , waiting to be dissected for an essay question . Purpose and answers arise from our own perceptions . If ProtagonistA think there is no good then all the world will be black and hopeless . If ProtagonistA think an eye for an eye is justice ProtagonistA stumble through your life blind with righteous indignation . * < nl > * But if you care and hope and love , the world is full of small beautiful things , always working together , always persisting against the selfish and chaotic . We can be grotesque and sublime all at once if we never let the former outweigh the latter in our minds . * < nl > * ProtagonistB 'm sorry if it 's not the answers ProtagonistA wanted ProtagonistA , but please do n't fail ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB 've never failed a test before . * < nl > ProtagonistA wiped the tears from the corners of ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA did not know what ProtagonistA had been expecting . There was comfort in the idea that there existed someone who knew all things . Part of ProtagonistA was disappointed that ProtagonistB was just another fact - hoarding bookworm . < nl > But it seemed ProtagonistB was just as clueless as anyone else when it came to life 's truly crippling problems . Or exponentially more brilliant . ProtagonistA had not decided which yet . ProtagonistA only knew ProtagonistA needed another drink . < nl > * * * < nl > /r / shoringupfragments < nl > Edit : holy shit thank ProtagonistA ProtagonistA have never been gilded before < eos > 
< sos >  Some tea , ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asked to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB squinted at ProtagonistA having forgotten ProtagonistB's glasses upstairs . < nl >  Yes , earthling ,  ProtagonistA boomed and whispered all at once , careful not to burst ProtagonistB's delicate eardrums with ProtagonistA's natural voice as ProtagonistA had with the last earthling ProtagonistA 'd met . < nl >  Call ProtagonistB Grammy ,  ProtagonistB said , and set about preparing the kettle to boil after setting a plate of cookies on the table . < nl >  Yes , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA corrected ProtagonistA .  Thank ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA added as a stilted afterthought . < nl > --- < nl > ProtagonistC typed the word  dear  into ProtagonistC's database . < nl >  Dear : an affectionate term referring to one who is figuratively close to the speaker , such as a family member or an old friend .  < nl > ProtagonistC ran ProtagonistC's hand through ProtagonistC's tendrils and sighed . < nl >  Agent from Earth sector 9 reporting ,  ProtagonistC whispered into ProtagonistC's communicator .  Advise immediate shelving of phase two . ProtagonistC repeat , advise to abort phase two .  < nl > The response rang clear over the comm channel :  Report received , ProtagonistC . Mission briefing in two cycles .  < nl >  Acknowledged .  < nl >  Did ProtagonistC say something , ProtagonistC ?  ProtagonistB asked , turning toward ProtagonistC with a pleasant smile on ProtagonistB's old and weathered face . < nl >  Not at all , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistC said .  Thank ProtagonistB for the cookies .  < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA sat down on the sidewalk , shaking a jug of coins at the bypassing people . ProtagonistA did n't have a name or face because this story took place in a world without a proper setting or forethought , words were scarce and descriptions suffered in turn . The only things that existed were ProtagonistA's immense fortune somewhere out in the ether , and the busy street , which was the scene of the story . < nl > Not too surprisingly , ProtagonistB walked up to ProtagonistA . Let 's call ProtagonistB ProtagonistB , I mean , who really cares about ProtagonistB's name . What matters is that ProtagonistB was a struggling single mother . ProtagonistB was several months behind on ProtagonistB's rent , and ProtagonistB's landlord was evicting ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB also had a daughter that was very ill - chronically so - and did n't have money for proper treatment . < nl > Seeing ProtagonistA on the street , dressed in nothing but rags , made ProtagonistB stop . No matter how rough things got , there were always people who had it worse . ProtagonistB was just about to give ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's last spare change , when something unbelievable happened - something that was n't in the script . ProtagonistB noticed ProtagonistC . < nl > Now a new dilemma presented itself to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had ProtagonistB's arm stretched out and ready to drop the coin into the jug of ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistB hesitated . ProtagonistC probably needed the money more than ProtagonistA . Could ProtagonistB change ProtagonistB's mind in this situation ? Was that the right thing to do ? The expression of mixed happiness and surprise on ProtagonistA's face made ProtagonistB's heart ache . What would ProtagonistB see in ProtagonistA's gray eyes if ProtagonistB pulled ProtagonistB's hand back ? Disappointment ? Hatred ? < nl > ProtagonistB's eyes wandered to the dime in ProtagonistB's hand . Could ProtagonistB ask ProtagonistD if ProtagonistD could change it for two nickels so that ProtagonistB could give them one each ? That seemed very out of line to ProtagonistB . < nl >  Just drop it in ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said with a look at ProtagonistC .  ProtagonistC 'll be better off from it as well .  < nl > ProtagonistB was a bit taken aback by the bold statement . It was such a blunt thing to say . How would ProtagonistC be better off if ProtagonistB gave the money to ProtagonistA ? That seemed like such a messed up idea - ProtagonistC was clearly starving . < nl >  ProtagonistB , uh , ProtagonistB ...  ProtagonistB said and finally pulled ProtagonistB's hand back . < nl > ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head at ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB sniffed . ProtagonistB dropped the coin into the open palm of ProtagonistC and hurried off . The problem with this course of action , even though it seemed morally right to ProtagonistB , was that ProtagonistA still had n't received help . < nl > Now , if ProtagonistA had been a proper character with a bit of depth , ProtagonistA would 've realized that ProtagonistB was a good person anyway , and hurried after ProtagonistB to give ProtagonistB ProtagonistA's fortune . I mean , why did it have to be to ProtagonistA in the first place ? If someone gave a starving child money , would n't they be deserving of the fairytale ending in this scenario ? If ProtagonistA had any sense of morality , ProtagonistA would n't be out on the streets playing games to see who gets ProtagonistA's fortune . ProtagonistA would 've helped all the homeless children in the city . ProtagonistA would 've distributed food and helped people out of the gutter . < nl > But since this is not a proper setting or characterization , just a random scene with a made up scenario , ProtagonistE walked by . ProtagonistE was Michael Foroza , a crime lord that preyed upon the weak and exploited those with good intentions . ProtagonistE was the man who was evicting ProtagonistB and ProtagonistC . And while digging through ProtagonistE's pocket for ProtagonistE's phone to call in another hit on an innocent person , a random coin dropped out and accidentally landed in ProtagonistC's jug . < nl > * * * * < nl > r / Lilwa_Dexel < eos > 
< sos >  What brings ProtagonistA here ProtagonistA ?  < nl > ProtagonistC stared at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was about seven with big blue eyes and a mass of dark blonde hair . ProtagonistA's clothes were worn but clean and had been mended . The pink back pack and matching lunch box looked new . < nl >  ProtagonistB and ProtagonistA were walking to school when a big crowd separated us and now ProtagonistA ca n't find ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA's name is Sylvia . Can ProtagonistC help ProtagonistA find ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistC's heart nearly melted at ProtagonistA's request .  How about ProtagonistC take ProtagonistA to the police station . They can find ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistC replied . ProtagonistC grabbed ProtagonistA's hand as ProtagonistC's stomach growled loudly . ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistC and sniffled . < nl >  Are ProtagonistC hungry ProtagonistC ? ProtagonistA can share ProtagonistA's lunch with ProtagonistC .  < nl >  ProtagonistC could n't take ProtagonistA's food ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA need it for school .  < nl >  ProtagonistB packed two sandwiches in case ProtagonistA have a classmate who does n't have a lunch . ProtagonistC 're not a classmate but ProtagonistC do n't have a sandwich .  < nl > ProtagonistA dug around ProtagonistA's little lunchbox and pulled out a turkey sandwich with cheese and a juice box . Smiling , ProtagonistA handed it to ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was touched . After spending weeks on the street waiting for someone to show ProtagonistC some kindness , ProtagonistA put them to shame by offering a sandwich . ProtagonistC took the sandwich and juice with a word of thanks and bit into it . < nl >  Thank ProtagonistA ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA are very kind at such a young age .  < nl >  ProtagonistB has always taught ProtagonistA to be kind to others . ProtagonistB always keeps snacks and stuff in ProtagonistB's car or bag for people in need .  < nl >  Wise words to live by .  < nl > ProtagonistC finished the sandwich and juice and was about to start the walk to the police department when ProtagonistC heard tearful and frantic yelling . ProtagonistD came running down the street calling ProtagonistA's name . ProtagonistC got ProtagonistD's attention and ProtagonistD came to the duo . < nl >  Sylvia ! ProtagonistD's sweet baby . ProtagonistD was so scared that ProtagonistD lost ProtagonistA ! Are ProtagonistA okay ?  The emotions in ProtagonistD's voice showed that ProtagonistD was truly worried about ProtagonistA . < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm fine ProtagonistB . ProtagonistC was going to help ProtagonistA find ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB please quit squishing ProtagonistA .  < nl > ProtagonistD laughed and let ProtagonistA go . ProtagonistD then stood up and turned ProtagonistD's attention to ProtagonistC . < nl >  How can ProtagonistD ever repay ProtagonistC ProtagonistC ?  < nl >  ProtagonistD already have . Now it is ProtagonistD's turn to repay ProtagonistC .  < eos > 
< sos >  You live like this ?  ProtagonistA asked , gently waking me up . < nl > I opened my eyes and stared at the ceiling .    Yeah .  < nl > ProtagonistA walked across the room and started rummaging through my dresser .   Casually dropping socks and some receipts on the floor .   I was n't sure why the receipts were in there , I had n't bought anything in years . < nl > ProtagonistA muttered .    Bunch of crap , nothing worth taking .  < nl > I sighed and sat up , sliding my legs off the bed and onto ProtagonistB .   ProtagonistB snorted and rolled over .   Useless damn thing .   Just lets someone walk into my room .   I rubbed ProtagonistB's belly with my bare foot .   ProtagonistB's tongue lolled out the side of ProtagonistB's pug face .   ProtagonistB snorted again contentedly . < nl >  What are ProtagonistA looking for ?  < nl > ProtagonistA looked over ProtagonistA's shoulder and glared at me before answering .    Dunno , something worth taking ProtagonistA guess .  < nl >  Take ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB 's worthless .  < nl > I got up and headed to the kitchen , ProtagonistA continued to rummage around in my room .   I made coffee .   ProtagonistB followed me and headed to ProtagonistB's bowl .   ProtagonistB is always hungry .   I ignored it , did n't have anything for ProtagonistB anyway . < nl > The day was grey with a slight drizzle , but it was bright enough I could see my way around .   I left the light off , figured ProtagonistA would prefer that .   Something crashed and broke in the bathroom .   I grabbed the coffee off the machine and took a careful sip .   Stuffs hot right when it comes off the machine . < nl >  What the hell are ProtagonistA doing ?   Breaking my bathroom up ?  < nl > I leaned around the corner and peered down the hall , a shadow moved there , ProtagonistA had turned on the bathroom light .   ProtagonistA   Loud as hell and now turning on lights . < nl > ProtagonistA's head poked through the bathroom door .   ProtagonistA was pretty , if a bit angular and gawky .   ProtagonistA sneered which made ProtagonistA much less pretty . < nl >  Maybe .   Maybe ProtagonistA 'll break you up too and take everything  . < nl > I chuckled and that seemed to irritate ProtagonistA more .   Then I laughed out loud and ProtagonistB trotted over and sat in the hallway looking at ProtagonistA , and then at me .   ProtagonistA glared at us both .   I shrugged and went back in the kitchen , ProtagonistB did whatever dogs do when you are n't looking at them .   ProtagonistA cursed and I heard ProtagonistA coming down the hall . < nl > ProtagonistA walked in the kitchen with ProtagonistB in tow .    ProtagonistA smell coffee .  < nl >  Yeah , ProtagonistA ca n't function without it , robbery or no , it 's hard to deal with the mornings until ProtagonistA have some .  < nl > ProtagonistA looked through the refrigerator .    Bloody hell , what 's in this Tupperware ?  < nl > I looked up from my coffee , French Roast , it was delicious .    Who knows , ProtagonistA have n't opened that thing up in months .  < nl > ProtagonistA put it back quickly and closed the door .   ProtagonistA seemed defeated and sat heavily on the only other chair in the kitchen .   I considered telling ProtagonistA it only had three of its four legs .   But hey , ProtagonistA was trying to rob me , let ProtagonistA figure it out .   The result was predictable , ProtagonistA went down in a heap , flat on ProtagonistA's back .   The chair now had one and a half legs .   It startled ProtagonistB .   ProtagonistB jumped up and walked over to where ProtagonistA lay , staring at the ceiling , and started licking ProtagonistA's face . < nl > I leaned over and peered down at ProtagonistA's , steaming cup of coffee in my hand . < nl >  ProtagonistA live like this ?  < nl >  Yeah  ProtagonistA said , staring at the ceiling . < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA's stomach growled aggressively as ProtagonistA pushed past the crest of the hill , leaning heavily on the metal stick ProtagonistA carried in one hand . For a second , ProtagonistA's eyes lit up with expectation before turning ash gray once more . The sand stretched out for miles , the sight of great buildings on the horizon the only thing convincing ProtagonistA the sands did not simply continue forever . ProtagonistA sighed heavily , ProtagonistA's hot breath starting to fog up ProtagonistA's goggles , as ProtagonistA began ProtagonistA's methodical descent down the hill . The earth was hard and dense as ProtagonistA's boots struggled to dig into it , forcing ProtagonistA to spend several seconds for every step , making sure ProtagonistA would n't fall again . It was slow and grueling , but ProtagonistA eventually made it down , sinking shallowly into the cold sand . < nl > ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA missing the hard stone of ProtagonistA's homeland , something ProtagonistA never thought ProtagonistA would say . It was tough and cold , but at the very least it was reliable , something ProtagonistA desperately wished for as the winds kicked up whatever stray sand had not already frozen in place . Digging ProtagonistA's face deeper into ProtagonistA's collar , ProtagonistA started making ProtagonistA's way toward the lone skeleton of a building in front of ProtagonistA , buried halfway into the sands . < nl > Stepping behind a large concrete wall shielding ProtagonistA from the wind , ProtagonistA pressed ProtagonistA back against it and slid down into a sitting position with a sigh . ProtagonistA had traded ProtagonistA's last Potato for this information , but feeling warmth finally return to ProtagonistA's face made it feel more than worth it . ProtagonistA sat there for a while , resting , and trying to warm ProtagonistA up a bit . But most importantly ProtagonistA was trying to stay awake . ProtagonistA had seen many people stronger than ProtagonistA , succumb to the sleeping death of the desert and was not about to make the same mistake . No matter how heavy ProtagonistA's eyes felt . < nl > ProtagonistA jolted awake , not knowing if ProtagonistA had been sleeping for two hours or two seconds , and terrified of both scenarios . ProtagonistA attempted to slow ProtagonistA's breathing , looking around the broken room for something to focus on . In one corner was lay the bones of some man or beast that had at one point had the same idea as ProtagonistA , perhaps foreshadowing ProtagonistA's own demise . Another corner was charred as if by fire and it made ProtagonistA long for the warm fires ProtagonistA had left to continue ProtagonistA's travels . And lastly , in the corner directly to ProtagonistA's right , there was some piece of scrap metal sticking out of the sand . ProtagonistA stared at it , wondering what it could have been for . Maybe a skyscraper that reached high into the clouds , or a ship that could ferry ProtagonistA out into the abyss . < nl > ProtagonistA jolted again , this time catching ProtagonistA before ProtagonistA's eyes had fully closed , and begrudgingly pushed ProtagonistA off the ground . Joints aching violently , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way over to the scrap metal , thankful for the boost that even just walking gave ProtagonistA's concentration . It looked strange when you were this close to it , less like scrap and more like a container , perhaps containing something of value ? It took ProtagonistA's maybe ten minutes to dig out the case enough for ProtagonistA to remove it with brute force . It was n't that large , maybe 15 inches across , and ProtagonistA could n't spot any kind of physical lock . < nl > Flipping the case open , there was a matt black rectangle sitting snugly inside the padding , accompanied by a much smaller rectangle attached to its side . Carefully removing the rectangle from its casing ProtagonistA found that it opened up to reveal a keyboard underneath , letters ProtagonistA did n't recognize mixed in with familiar symbols . It was a computer and , as ProtagonistA found out from the lights turning on in unison , a working one . As the operating system flashed onto the screen ProtagonistA chuckled to ProtagonistA about how long ago it must have been when this was made . < nl > There were three profiles , one had a picture of a suitcase , one had a picture of a painting , and one had a picture of a robot action figure . Clicking on the suitcase ProtagonistA was taken to a white page with black text . Of course , ProtagonistA could n't read any of it , but there were still some pictures around . On one side ProtagonistA noticed that there were a lot of different symbols forming similar words , and tried looking for ProtagonistA's own language , but to no avail . Instead , ProtagonistA just clicked around using an antiquated trackpad , marveling at some of the images . < nl > Eventually , ProtagonistA got to a page that that had an image of a field . But it was not like any field ProtagonistA had ever seen . It was lush and green , flowers of different colors adorning the grass that almost swayed before ProtagonistA's very eyes . It was n't there to feed anyone , was n't there to be built upon . It just existed , beautiful and green , right there on the page . And ProtagonistA cried as it all faded to black and the batteries gave out , leaving behind ProtagonistA freezing in the desert , alone . < eos > 
< sos >  What about the public ?  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 've always been open about things .  < nl > ProtagonistB sucked on ProtagonistB's lower lip intensely and looked at ProtagonistA , and then over at ProtagonistC . < nl >  The public is not ready for something like this ,  ProtagonistB said . < nl >  How are we supposed to fund a journey like this in secret ? Alpha Canis Majoris is 2.6 parsecs away - that 's , uh , over eight light years .  < nl > ProtagonistC finally rose from ProtagonistC's seat and hurried over to the screen . With a few quick sweeps and taps of ProtagonistC's fingers , ProtagonistC drew up the plans for the project . When ProtagonistC first started studying marine biology , ProtagonistC never thought ProtagonistC 'd be working on something like this . Two of the world 's most powerful men relied directly on ProtagonistC for a project that would cost ... ProtagonistC did n't even want to think about the numbers . < nl > A solar system popped up on the screen . The white main - sequence star of spectral type at the center , known as Sirius A , was twice as large as our own sun . The system around it looked very different , as well , with another star , a white dwarf called Sirius B , orbiting the center of the system . NASA had spent the last year trying to gather as much information about the system as possible , and nearly all resources had been funneled into the project . Strings had even been pulled with the government , and part of the military funding now went straight into NASA 's pocket . < nl > The model of the solar system on the screen shifted and zoomed in on a bright blue planet . After decoding the whale song , ProtagonistC had spent many nights awake , thinking about the implications . ProtagonistC had always thought about night sky 's reflection in the sea - the only mirror able to hold the universe on its shiny surface - and it did n't feel all too strange that some of the creatures living there would somehow be connected to vast expanses of space . < nl >  So , that 's where we 're going ?  ProtagonistA said and rose from ProtagonistA's seat as well . < nl >  ProtagonistB take it ProtagonistA 're interested then ,  ProtagonistB said and joined the other two . < nl >  Of course , ProtagonistB just wish ProtagonistB 'd told ProtagonistB sooner .  < nl > The two men shook hands , and ProtagonistB's lips turned into a smile of relief . Getting ProtagonistA and SpaceX on board was crucial and had likely been a significant stress factor to ProtagonistB for quite some time now . Their technology on rapid space travel would be crucial for this expedition . < nl >  ProtagonistB 'm happy you 've decided to join us , let 's set up the meetings as soon as possible .  < nl > ProtagonistA nodded .  ProtagonistA just have one question : who 'll be the head of this mission ? Who will lead the expedition ?  < nl > ProtagonistB threw out ProtagonistB's wrinkly hand and sat back down in the armchair .  ProtagonistB's number one pick would be ProtagonistC .  < nl > ProtagonistC's eyes went wide .  B - but ProtagonistC do n't have any astronaut training ; ProtagonistC 'm just-  < nl >  Of course ,  ProtagonistA cut ProtagonistC off excitedly ,  ProtagonistC . A fine choice !  < nl > ProtagonistC's heart was racing now . ProtagonistC 'd never been out of the country before , and ProtagonistC felt like there must be hundreds , if not thousands , of people more qualified than ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC thought about ProtagonistD , and wondered who 'd take care of ProtagonistD if ProtagonistC left for ... another solar system . < nl >  What do ProtagonistC say , ProtagonistC ?  ProtagonistB said . < nl > ProtagonistC swallowed and took a deep breath . Was ProtagonistC ready for this ? What would ProtagonistC's mother say ? ProtagonistC played the scenario in ProtagonistC's head : ' Hey , Mom , ProtagonistC 'm going to Sirius for a bit - don't expect ProtagonistC back before Christmas . ' The look on ProtagonistC's mother 's face would be a combination of pride and sadness . < nl > On a mission like this ... well , ProtagonistC would n't be returning to Earth , that much was certain . Still , the discovery of the meaning behind the whale song made ProtagonistC shiver . ProtagonistC had to go . < nl >  ProtagonistC 'd be honored ,  ProtagonistC said and bowed slightly . < nl >  Then it 's settled !  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistC can start picking out ProtagonistC's team , ProtagonistC - ProtagonistA , let 's continue our talk in private - ProtagonistB have a few propositions ProtagonistB 'd like to run by ProtagonistA .  < nl > The two men left the room , and ProtagonistC found ProtagonistC's eyes wandering to the massive clock that adorned the wall . One year and two days left to launch . ProtagonistC was about to leave Earth forever - the thought was dizzying - and the journey there would take so long ... ProtagonistC 'd be close to forty when they finally reached Alpha Canis Majoris . ProtagonistC could n't quite wrap ProtagonistC's head around it . ProtagonistC was nineteen now , and by the end of the journey , ProtagonistC would 've spent more time on board that space ship than on Earth . < nl > Still shaky from the unexpected news , ProtagonistC turned off the computer and plugged ProtagonistC's earphones in . The shrill but soft sounds , echoing through the ocean filled ProtagonistC's mind . The song was beautiful and sad - emotions that perfectly portrayed the meanings behind it . < nl > * * * * < nl > [ Part 2](https://www.reddit.com / r / Lilwa_Dexel / comments/6w4j6y / the_song_of_sirius_part_2/ ) < nl > r / Lilwa_Dexel for more . < eos > 
< sos > Once upon a time there was ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA woke up one morning feeling as shameful as ever , but something was ... different . ProtagonistA felt a little less lonely than usual , as if ProtagonistA was sharing the house with a close and trustworthy friend . ProtagonistA went to the kitchen to fix ProtagonistA something along the line of breakfast . ProtagonistA opened the cereal cupboard , expecting ProtagonistA's usual stale and tasteless dehydrated oats ; however , in its place was pancake mix and healthy , albeit sugary , cereal ! < nl > ProtagonistA was astounded , no , bewildered to find this . ProtagonistA danced around the kitchen , then stopped , the colour in ProtagonistA's face draining . ProtagonistA realized that somebody would have needed to have broken into ProtagonistA's house , noticed ProtagonistA's situation , gone shopping and then put the products in ProtagonistA's cupboard . ProtagonistA thought about calling the police , but decided to hold back from doing so , doubting anybody would believe ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA got the pancake mix and added water from ProtagonistA's tap and made a breakfast ProtagonistA had never imagined ProtagonistA could have ever gotten to eat . Although ProtagonistA could taste the dirt from the tap water , ProtagonistA was unfazed . < nl > After brekfast , ProtagonistA went to take a shower , and saw some good old , white and cleaning soap on the rest thing in ProtagonistA's shower .  That s fucking weird  ProtagonistA said .  Not only did ProtagonistA have pancake mix for ProtagonistA but now soap ?  Now ProtagonistA was starting to feel uncomfortale . ProtagonistA smelled the soap . Although pungent , it reminded ProtagonistA of the soap in ProtagonistB's bathroom when ProtagonistA lived with ProtagonistB during ProtagonistA's teen years . ProtagonistA wetted it in ProtagonistA's sink and scrubbed it on ProtagonistA's left palm , then washed it off , some of the dirt on ProtagonistA's hand had already washed off ! < nl > ProtagonistA got in the fuckin showr and got ProtagonistA clean . ProtagonistA said to ProtagonistA  wow , ProtagonistA wonder who got ProtagonistA this , it 's like ProtagonistA have a gardian angel or somethin . After getting out of the shower ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC in ProtagonistA's mirror .  Hello ?  ProtagonistA asked . ProtagonistC replied to ProtagonistA  hello ProtagonistA . ProtagonistC have been sent by God to protect and care for ProtagonistA .  < nl > Holy fuckin shit can ProtagonistA belive this ? ProtagonistA got agoddamb angle savin her and shit ! ProtagonistC got out of the mirror and held ProtagonistA's hand .  Do nt touch ProtagonistA ProtagonistC  said ProtagonistA , cuz its clearly not the fuckin angel talking , now is it ? ProtagonistC helped ProtagonistA get dressed . ProtagonistC 's a guy angel , okay ? Why , ProtagonistA ask ? Cuz ProtagonistA said so ! ProtagonistC walkd ProtagonistA out of the bathroom and they watched tv . < nl > Dam sad ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC got some good shows on here . The girl and ProtagonistC watched the tv for a bit . God , what an ProtagonistA doing with ProtagonistA's life ? A girl and angle watchng tv ? Why did ProtagonistA even start writing this ! You know what , fuck it ! ProtagonistA 'm gon na go take a nap ... < eos > 
< sos >  ProtagonistA just do n't see why it has to have holes everywhere .  ProtagonistA gestured at the gap in the middle of the platemail .  Wo n't ProtagonistA get stabbed in the stomach ?  < nl >  Oh , no . You see , our armor is very high level . It gives +15 resistance against piercing . That 's much better than the iron plate you picked up off the bandit 's hideout ,  I explained , throwing a dagger at the stomach - hole . It bounced off .  Materials are short , so the holes are necessary . We made sure to put them in areas where they 'd keep you properly ventilated .  < nl > ProtagonistB shoved ProtagonistA aside and slammed ProtagonistB's hands on the counter .  SPEEDRUN !  ProtagonistB shouted , and I scrambled to bring out a bag of standard gear . ProtagonistB grabbed half of it , tossed ProtagonistB's entire coin pouch on the table , and ran outside before ProtagonistA could get up . < nl >  Sorry about that . Anyway , if ProtagonistA 're concerned about the safety of this piece , we have many others available for ProtagonistA's selection .  I pointed at the displays on the wall . < nl >  Is n't that one just lingerie ?  ProtagonistA asked , pointing at the far left stand with a golden pedestal . < nl >  Do n't worry about that one , it costs premium currency and does n't provide any armor . So yeah , it basically is just lingerie . We sell it too . Well , if ProtagonistA 're looking for something a little better covered , our Nightress set does n't have any holes .  ProtagonistA examined the set of pitch black medium armor . < nl >  It 's a little better , but why does it have boobs ? Wo n't ProtagonistA fracture ProtagonistA's sternum if ProtagonistA fall over ? You sure ProtagonistA ca n't just wear male armor ?  I sighed and brought out a set of male armor . < nl >  Well , if ProtagonistA insist , ProtagonistA can try this . It 's the standard male counterpart for ProtagonistA's level , though it might feel a bit uncomfortable . 4000 gold .  I set it on the counter . < nl >  It 's pretty expensive , but oh well . Whatever lets ProtagonistA keep ProtagonistA's dignity .  ProtagonistA fished around in ProtagonistA's pouch .  Damn , ProtagonistA 'm only at 3800 . Let ProtagonistA sell some equipment really quick .  < nl > ProtagonistA slid ProtagonistA's money , ProtagonistA's sword , ProtagonistA's boots , ProtagonistA's pants , and ProtagonistA's bandit plate mail across the counter and walked out completely naked carrying the male armor . < nl > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ < nl > [ more](https://www.reddit.com / r / Tensingstories/ ) < eos > 
< sos > The rowdy crowd rabbled . They rabbled in a rowdier manner than any rowdy crowd had rabbled before . < nl >  Order ! Order within this hall !  shouted Mr. Hanner , the mayor of Stubbornsville . His voice reverberating around the rickety old hall . < nl > The gathered crowd was a ragtag bunch . Mainly dressed in old potato bags , mud , and , in some cases , old potato bags made of mud . They were also difficult to control and were prone to mob fever . But the rowdiness was quickly put to bed when the doors to the hall burst open . < nl > ProtagonistA , atop of the tallest horse the villagers had ever seen , entered and slowly trotted towards the front of the hall stopping just short of   the stage . ProtagonistA unseated and descended from ProtagonistA's high horse , slowly walking up the steps to the front of the stage . < nl >  Greetings , peasants ,  said ProtagonistA , lifting ProtagonistA's arms aloft to greet the crown in a demeaning manner .  ProtagonistA come from the future and ProtagonistA 'm here to tell you just how much better ProtagonistA am than you .  < nl > The crowd did n't react . They just looked on confused . < nl >  Thought the whole future thing would have got a bigger reaction but let 's move on ,  said ProtagonistA , pacing around the stage .  How can ProtagonistA be a superior person just like you , ProtagonistA hear you ask . Well , ProtagonistA have one word for you : Veganism ,  said ProtagonistA , in an incredibly condescending and preachy tone . < nl >  Are ProtagonistA the person who has been putting all those pictures of gross dead animals on the bulletin board ?  asked one of the gathered peasants .  The pictures with the words on top and bottom .  < nl >  Yes , that was ProtagonistA ,  announced ProtagonistA , clearly proud of the fact .  ProtagonistA assume this has already converted hundreds of you to ProtagonistA's way of thinking as it is a fool - proof strategy in the year 2017 .  < nl >  The pictures on the bulletin board worked on ProtagonistB ,  admitted ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB could only stomach half of ProtagonistB's dog after seeing one of the pictures .  < nl > ProtagonistA looked towards ProtagonistC ,  Wait , why are ProtagonistC's people eating dogs ?  < nl >  Why are ProtagonistB eating ProtagonistB's dogs , ProtagonistB ?  asked ProtagonistC , looking to get to the bottom of this case . < nl >  The dog was organic if that makes a difference ,  said ProtagonistB . < nl >  No ,  said ProtagonistA .  No that does not make a difference .  < nl >  Are cats OK to eat if ProtagonistA's veganism ?  another voice queried from the crowd .  I tend to eat cats .  < nl >  ProtagonistC really does eat a lot of cats ,  added ProtagonistC . < nl >  No . Why would cats be OK if dogs are not ? Veganism is about not eating any meat at all thus making you a superior person ,  explained ProtagonistA . < nl >  I do n't understand ,  shouted a voice from the crowd . < nl >  What part do you not understand ?  asked ProtagonistA . < nl > The peasant woman in the crowd stood up ,  I do n't understand how not eating meat makes ProtagonistA a better person .  < nl >  Humans do not need to consume meat ,  explained ProtagonistA .  And by not eating meat , animals get to live free from cages allowing people like ProtagonistA to feel smug and better than others .  < nl >  Can we eat animal if they are eating us ?  asked the peasant lady who was still standing .  ProtagonistD stole my child . ProtagonistD knocked at door pretending to be kind neighbour . But it was all lie . A dirty bear lie .  < nl >  There 's just no way that 's true ,  said ProtagonistA . < nl >  ProtagonistC 'm afraid it 's true . It was easily a top 5 case of child being eaten by ProtagonistD ,  said ProtagonistC , following up .  Some actually said top 3 but it was never agreed upon .  < nl >  Listen , we 're getting off track here , the idea is to not eat any animals under any circumstance . That is what separates us vegans from those who are quite clearly below us .  < nl >  Are there any other ways we can feel superior to others while still eating meat ?  asked ProtagonistC .  ProtagonistC just do n't feel like veganism is going to work in this village .  < nl > ProtagonistA began to pace , deep in thought .  The issue is , it 's difficult to be smugger than being vegan but there is something else . By a show of hands , how many of you exercise ?  < nl > Around twenty hands went up in to the air . < nl >  So about a quarter of you exercise . That 's good . Now , how many of you make sure you tell others about your exercising ?  < nl > Every hand fell back down . < nl >  You see ,  said ProtagonistA ,  how do you expect to feel better than others if you 're not obnoxiously showing everyone how much better than them you are ?  < nl >  ProtagonistE's name Boris . ProtagonistE feel better after run ,  said ProtagonistE , shouting from the back . < nl >  Come on up , ProtagonistE ,  said ProtagonistA , with ProtagonistE obliging .  When did ProtagonistE go on ProtagonistE's run ?  < nl >  Today ,  replied ProtagonistE . < nl >  And how many people are aware ProtagonistE went on ProtagonistE's run ?  < nl >  Zero .  < nl >  ProtagonistE , what is the point of improving ProtagonistE if ProtagonistE are n't forcing it down the throats of people who are n't bothered ? ProtagonistE 're missing a key element of being better than everyone else . Take this piece of paper and write ' Would n't be able to live with ProtagonistE if ProtagonistE did n't get out and run every day . Attack the day ! '  < nl > ProtagonistE wrote the message . < nl >  Now pin it to that wall over there .  < nl > ProtagonistE walked over to the wall in the hall next to the stage and pinned up the message . < nl >  Everyone look at that message ,  shouted ProtagonistA . < nl > Everyone turned to view the message . < nl >  Now , ProtagonistE , how do ProtagonistE feel knowing all of these people now know ProtagonistE went on ProtagonistE's run ?  < nl > ProtagonistE looked at the crowd viewing ProtagonistE's message ,  It makes ProtagonistE feel above them .  < nl >  That 's it !  shouted ProtagonistA ,  This is what ProtagonistA 'm telling you . It 's not the exercise , the unwillingness to eat meat , or the genuine efforts to improve yourself that 's important ; it 's letting other people know you 're better than them that is the key .  < nl >  I get it !  shouted a familiar voice from the crowd .  So all I have to do is let other people know I have eaten their dog .  < nl > * * * * < nl > ProtagonistA write shitty , silly stories on /r / BillMurrayMovies . Feel free to come along , not laugh at any of them and leave some judgement . < eos > 
< sos >  All in favour of sparing ProtagonistC's life , step forward !  < nl > I looked around the village square , but no one moved a muscle . The seconds rolled by , and the hope I held in my heart crumbled , only to be replaced by a sharp tang of bitterness , resentment . There was ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistA's eyes down , lips tightly pursed . I saw ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB was as silent , unmoving as ProtagonistA was . < nl > Old Man Bosworth , the twins Jaina and Jerry , Valerie , Daniel ... they too , everyone who had ever benefited in one way or the other from ProtagonistC's help , all suddenly bereft of courage , unwilling to stand up for ProtagonistC . < nl > The bloody ingrates . < nl >  Do ProtagonistC see how everyone fears ProtagonistC , ProtagonistC ?  asked ProtagonistD , shaking ProtagonistD's staff at ProtagonistC .  We tolerated ProtagonistC , gave ProtagonistC a place to call home , and this is how ProtagonistC repay us ? By bringing this evil magic into our village ?  < nl >  ProtagonistC am not evil ,  ProtagonistC said , ProtagonistC's voice carrying to the edges of the crowd .  ProtagonistC have done no harm to the village . ProtagonistC have only helped .  < nl >  Helped ? Helped ?  said ProtagonistD , ProtagonistD's voice rising in anger . ProtagonistD turned to the crowd , stretched out ProtagonistD's arms , then said ,  Evil fears the light , ProtagonistC . ProtagonistD shall show the village proof , proof of ProtagonistC's heresy ! ProtagonistD will show them the forbidden evils we found in ProtagonistC's hut ! Come , show them !  < nl > Fred and Richard , two of the strongest farmers in the village , retrieved a wooden chest from within ProtagonistD's hut . They struggled even though the load was shared between them , and after they placed the evidence in front of ProtagonistC , they took hurried steps backwards , leaving ProtagonistD the honour of opening the chest . < nl > ProtagonistD rummaged briefly , then retrieved what appeared to be a marble slate , dark and smooth on one side , white and pristine on the other . ProtagonistD held it triumphantly in the air , revelling in the reactions ProtagonistD was getting . < nl >  Has anyone ever seen a rock like this ?  ProtagonistD asked .  ProtagonistD promise you , no one has !  < nl >  It 's not right of ProtagonistD to have gone into ProtagonistC's hut like that ,  said ProtagonistC . < nl >  Oh ? And if ProtagonistD had not done so , if ProtagonistD had not suspected ProtagonistC of carrying out the dark one 's work , would ProtagonistD ever have discovered foul things such as this ?  < nl >  ProtagonistC do n't know what ProtagonistD are talking abou-  < nl > ProtagonistD squeezed the edges of the slate , and one side of it flared to life , emitting vibrant colours , as if someone had managed to trap a rainbow in stone . The crowd gasped , and I saw some of the adults shielding their children 's eyes . < nl >  If ProtagonistD had not been suspicious , if ProtagonistD had not known to spy on ProtagonistC , would ProtagonistD have discovered ProtagonistC's secrets , ProtagonistC ?  said ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD turned the slate towards us , then said ,  Listen ! Listen with your own ears ! This is ProtagonistC ! ProtagonistC ! Listen to the unholy mission ProtagonistC is on !  < nl > ProtagonistD need n't have commanded us in that manner . We were enraptured , spellbound by the moving images on the slate , of what appeared to a ... doppelganger of ProtagonistC , staring out at us , speaking to us . I heard whispers rise up , words like  impossible  ,  there 's two of ProtagonistC  ,  a soul , trapped in marble  . < nl > We fell silent though , once ProtagonistC began speaking . < nl >  42nd entry - no new developments in weeks . The search goes on ,  ProtagonistC said . ProtagonistC's unruly hair was tied back , and there was a steadiness to ProtagonistC's voice , a clarity to ProtagonistC's eyes which was n't usually there . ProtagonistC was not the Matilda we knew , the soft - minded , chattering and hyperactive Matilda we saw roaming the village from morning to night . < nl > It began to dawn on me that it was all an act . < nl >  ProtagonistC do n't understand !  said ProtagonistC , throwing up ProtagonistC's hands .  The historical records are clear ! The Influencer came from these parts , and ProtagonistC have narrowed it down to this village ! ProtagonistC did not travel this far back in time in vain ! Yet ... yet ProtagonistC have met with all of them , talked to each and every one , but no one , no one stands out ! ProtagonistC have run ProtagonistC's tests , checked ProtagonistC's equipment over and over , but still , not a single one displays even a modicum of psychic powe-  < nl >  And these are ProtagonistC's tools , by ProtagonistC's own admission !  yelled ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD kicked the chest over , and its contents spilled across the ground , next to ProtagonistC . An excited hum rose amongst the crowds as they feasted their eyes on the unnatural objects , the shiny , glinty collection of baubles created by ProtagonistC's own hands . < nl >  Answer ProtagonistD !  ProtagonistD continued , striking ProtagonistD's staff into the ground for emphasis .  Tell ProtagonistD why ProtagonistD should not have ProtagonistC burned here , right where ProtagonistC are !  < nl > ProtagonistC raised ProtagonistC's head , stared straight at the crowd . Most of them still had the decency to shuffle and squirm , but still no one intervened . < nl >  ProtagonistC have done no harm to anyone ,  said ProtagonistC .  It is true , ProtagonistC kept secret the real reason why ProtagonistC was here , and ProtagonistC did not tell anyone why it is that ProtagonistC know what ProtagonistC know . But ProtagonistC have only meant well . ProtagonistC have shared ProtagonistC's medicines , ProtagonistC have imparted ProtagonistC's knowledge ... ProtagonistC only asked for a bit of solace as ProtagonistC conducted ProtagonistC's research . ProtagonistC meant no harm .  < nl >  Enough ! Stop ProtagonistC's lies , right this instant !  ProtagonistD said . ProtagonistD struck with ProtagonistD's staff , hitting ProtagonistC on the shoulder . I saw ProtagonistC's tumble forwards , ProtagonistC's forehead striking the ground . < nl >  To ProtagonistD ! Bring the torches ! We will burn ProtagonistC where ProtagonistC is !  < nl > Fred and Richard complied , and as they inched towards ProtagonistC , torches in hand , blank expressions on their faces , I waited again , hoping someone would do something , anything . < nl > I pulled on the sleeves of those around me , begging them to step forward . < nl > But they shrugged me off , transfixed . No one was going to listen to a boy who was still too young to shave . More importantly , no one was going to listen to their hearts , their consciences . < nl > I heard ProtagonistC cry out , though from pain or fear I was not sure . The torch was inches away , but ProtagonistC could not twist free , as tight as ProtagonistC's bonds were . < nl > I grit my teeth , then did a quick headcount . Two dozen , maybe more . There were children too , and if I had more time I would have thought twice about whether they were as sturdy as the adults , whether they could recover as quickly . < nl > But I was out of time , and so I stepped forward , clenched my eyes , focused on a single word , and poured every shred of energy I had into it . I had never exerted myself so much before . < nl > * SLEEP * < nl > I knew it had worked when I heard the steady thuds of comatose bodies hitting the floor . I opened my eyes , and I saw that some of ProtagonistC's other possessions on the ground had lighted up , flashing an incandescent array of colours . I pushed past the crowd , pulled ProtagonistC up , shifted ProtagonistC's weight onto me . ProtagonistC struggled to keep ProtagonistC's eyes open . < nl >  ProtagonistC ... ProtagonistC was right ...  ProtagonistC said , smiling .  It ... it is real ...  < nl >  Later ,  I said .  We have to go , now . There 's a lot we have to talk about .  < nl > To better cope with ProtagonistC's weight , I borrowed ProtagonistD's staff . From the way ProtagonistD was sleeping peacefully on the ground , it did n't seem like ProtagonistD needed it . < nl > --- < nl > /r / rarelyfunny < eos > 
< sos >  I do n't know if ProtagonistA 's all that daft . I think ProtagonistA may be a witch .  < nl >  Who ? ProtagonistA A witch ? I doubt that very much .  < nl >  ProtagonistA could be playing dumb to throw us off , so we do n't suspect .  < nl >  We are talking about ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA , right ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA does have the best vegetables in the county . Could be ProtagonistA needs it for ProtagonistA's gardening spells .  < nl >  ProtagonistA ?  < nl >  We were the only village that did n't get the plague . Sounds like a sacrifice to me . And , I 'm pretty sure ProtagonistA cursed ProtagonistB .  < nl >  Cursed ProtagonistB ?  < nl >  Yeah , my mum says that years ago ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB got in an argument 'cause ProtagonistA's kid 's humours were all out of < nl > balance and ProtagonistB wanted to bleed the tyke . The kid died . Ever since then , ProtagonistB loses more patients than ProtagonistB saves .  < nl >  Well , you 've convinced me . I guess we 've got to burn ProtagonistA , then ?  < nl >  I do n't see anything else we can do . Ca n't have a witch in the village .  < nl > edit : formatting . < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA pushed a lock of hair from ProtagonistA's eyes as ProtagonistA leaned sheepishly against the doorway and looked lovingly at the back of ProtagonistB's head . ProtagonistB , in turn , was looking at the television . < nl > It was one in the morning on a Wednesday , and they were in a swanky hotel suite . In another context , this could almost have been romantic , ProtagonistA thought . < nl > ProtagonistA shuffled aside as a face with a lanyard ID pushed past ProtagonistA into the room , joining the throng . There were at least two dozen people in there , but ProtagonistA felt there was a special glow around ProtagonistB , the lighting seemed to pick ProtagonistB out , draw the eye . Or maybe it was just ProtagonistA's imagination . < nl > ProtagonistB was minutes away from being elected the President of the United States . < nl > Downstairs , there was a ballroom full of waiting devotees , balloons poised to drop . They were in Denver , Colorado . < nl > ProtagonistA was trying not to pay attention to the results , but it was impossible not to hear certain things . < nl >  ProtagonistB , our numbers are the same as the network 's ,  an aide was saying to ProtagonistB , though his eyes never left the screen .  Colorado is much closer than we thought .  < nl > Their home state . It was supposed to secure their Electoral College strategy , but it was failing them . Without it , ProtagonistB's campaign was over . < nl > ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's heart racing . How could this have happened ? All the east coast states had gone the way they 'd predicted . Something sickly was congealing in ProtagonistA's stomach , a strange and irrational certainty that this was ProtagonistA's fault . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA had done everything in ProtagonistA's power to help the campaign , but still ... a memory kept playing in ProtagonistA's mind . < nl > It was the night before . ProtagonistA had just spoken at a rally in Boulder - the last of the campaign . And then ProtagonistA had gone for dinner with ProtagonistC . Jason . ProtagonistA had know ProtagonistC since high school , and ProtagonistC had reached out . ProtagonistC had always been a strange one ; ProtagonistA still could not say what it was that had compelled ProtagonistA to accept ProtagonistC's invitation that evening . < nl >  ProtagonistA look tired , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC had said , over appetizers .  This last year must have been hard on ProtagonistA .  < nl > ProtagonistA thought over the endless busses and planes , the incessant press scrutiny of every aspect of their lives , the total lack of intimacy . < nl >  It 's been a trip , that 's for sure !  ProtagonistA said , attempting a good - natured chuckle . ProtagonistC stared at ProtagonistA . < nl >  ProtagonistC like to help people , ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA know that . ProtagonistC want to know what ProtagonistC can do for ProtagonistA .  < nl >  Oh , well at this point there 's not much-  < nl >  ProtagonistC do n't mean on the campaign . ProtagonistC mean , personally : what do ProtagonistA need ? After it 's all over tomorrow night , what do ProtagonistA want from life ?  < nl > ProtagonistC was looking at ProtagonistA strangely . Sincerity , ProtagonistA thought . ProtagonistC was thick with it . ProtagonistC was more sincere than anyone ProtagonistA had ever met . < nl >  Uh , that 's kind of ProtagonistC , ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistA realised ProtagonistA's lip was quivering . < nl >  ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC said , leaning forward . Eyes so full of pity .  Are ProtagonistA happy ?  < nl > ProtagonistA could n't stop it . Tears rolled down ProtagonistA's cheeks . ProtagonistA tried to dab them away , but it was hopeless . ProtagonistA forced ProtagonistA to breathe deeply . < nl >  ProtagonistA have n't been happy since ProtagonistB won the race for governor ,  ProtagonistA said , when ProtagonistA had regained control .  ProtagonistA hate it , that 's the truth . ProtagonistA hate politics . ProtagonistA wish with all ProtagonistA's heart ProtagonistB had stayed in law .  ProtagonistA inhaled again and tried to smile .  ProtagonistA have n't told anyone that . Gosh . ProtagonistC ca n't repeat it , please promise .  < nl > ProtagonistC leaned back , still full of sympathy .  ProtagonistC promise , and ProtagonistC understand . It must be unimaginably hard for ProtagonistA .  < nl > ProtagonistA smiled again . ProtagonistC was looking at the ceiling - now it was ProtagonistC who was taking a deep breath . ProtagonistC looked back at ProtagonistA . < nl >  OK ,  ProtagonistC said ,  ProtagonistC can help ProtagonistA . ProtagonistC can make it alright . ProtagonistC have ... some favours ProtagonistC can call in .  < nl >  What are ProtagonistC talking about ?  ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistC was standing up , paying the bill . ProtagonistA felt horrendously flustered . < nl >  ProtagonistC 'm talking about helping ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA . Do n't worry about a thing .  < nl > ProtagonistC turned back to look at ProtagonistA from the door .  Remember ,  ProtagonistC laughed ,  ProtagonistA owe ProtagonistC !  < nl > That was last night . Now ProtagonistA was was in a room that had just gone very quiet . A news anchor , full of his own importance , had just called Colorado for the opposition . < nl >  It 's a shock result , let me tell you ,  a pundit was saying .  We 're seeing a polling failure like nowhere else in the country . The state was always going to be close but there seems to have been a last minute swing of about 10,000 votes , mainly in the Boulder area , that handed it to ProtagonistB .  < eos > 
< sos > The line behind ProtagonistA was growing as ProtagonistA sifted through pages of words on a computerized booth . Each word was followed by a price tag that reflected its complexity . < nl >  Hurry . You , hurry , please ,  demanded a man in a custodian gear that stood behind ProtagonistA .  Go . Go .  The numerous people in the queue all seemed to nod in agreement . < nl > ProtagonistA had no words to reassure them that ProtagonistA was moving as fast as ProtagonistA could , so ProtagonistA remained silent and focused . < nl > The Department of Speech Permission , or DSP , was the government office in charge of selling word licenses to the public . For a citizen to be able to speak or write a word , the citizen must first purchase the right to use that word from this office . The DSP also had the power to set the prices . Depending on simplicity , utility or other unnamed factors , a word 's price could be relatively inexpensive . Other words could be so expensive that people often choose to buy a limited number of uses . < nl > ProtagonistB yelled out ,  Come on ! We all have things to do .  < nl > ProtagonistA could n't help but notice how flippantly ProtagonistB used so many wide - utility words . ProtagonistB must have bought them all for unlimited use . Despite that , however , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistB was poor as well . If ProtagonistB were actually wealthy , ProtagonistB would be in the Expedited Service Section of the DSP . < nl > ProtagonistA was right , of course . ProtagonistB was one of the many working class that bought into the notion that you have to fake it to make it . ProtagonistB had spent all ProtagonistB's savings and put ProtagonistB into debt in order to keep conversation with upper management .  Just pick one ! ProtagonistB have to get to work !  ProtagonistB had gotten so good at bluffing ProtagonistB's vocabulary that people rarely notice ProtagonistB only used one - syllable words . Unfortunately , ProtagonistB was unaware ProtagonistB's bosses had noticed and mocked ProtagonistB behind closed doors . < nl > ProtagonistA motioned to ProtagonistB as well . ProtagonistA had no words for ProtagonistB either . < nl > But not for long . ProtagonistA finally found the word for which ProtagonistA had been saving on ProtagonistA's lowly salary . A bright warning prompt flashed on screen .  Unlimited ?  it asked . Yes .  Are you sure ?  it warned one last time . Yes . < nl > ProtagonistA basked at ProtagonistA's profile on the computer screen . It now read : < nl > > * * ProtagonistA * * < nl > Sex : Male < nl > Age : 36 < nl > Total Vocabulary : 1 < nl > Accessible Words :  Revolution  ( unlimited ) < eos > 
< sos > I almost did n't recognize ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA walked in . Age will do that to a person . I 've said for years that men stop aging at twenty - five and do n't change one bit except for weight until they reach almost fifty . Women however evolve . It 's impossible to guess how old ProtagonistB is . Only if ProtagonistB is younger or older than you . < nl > That was the problem I had with ProtagonistA . The first time I met ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA was older than me by at least twenty years . That was two decades ago , almost to the day . Today ... ProtagonistA was younger . Hell , I do n't think ProtagonistA was allowed in normal bars . Not that I ever carded anyone . If you could find The Happy Hour , I 'd serve you . < nl > ProtagonistA came up to the bar and asked if the manager was about .   I blinked twice before telling ProtagonistA no . Then ProtagonistA asked about the owner . It took me a second to realize , ProtagonistA had n't been here yet . < nl > Fucking timeloops . < nl > I told ProtagonistA the owner was n't in , but I could probably help . ProtagonistA sighed and said ProtagonistA was looking for a job . ProtagonistA was stranded and needed to get back on ProtagonistA's feet . < nl > I asked if ProtagonistA had any skills . ProtagonistA looked embarrassed , then shook ProtagonistA's head . I almost said something , then tossed ProtagonistA an apron . Told ProtagonistA to clean up tables . Do a good job and ProtagonistA could come back tomorrow . < nl > ProtagonistA did and ProtagonistA did . About three weeks in , I started training ProtagonistA as a waitress , and within a year ProtagonistA could cover bar . It took a while , but I got ProtagonistA to the point where I could take days off and the place would n't burn down . < nl > Then one day I left my resignation on the counter with a note . < nl >  On a Friday , at 3:14am you will find ProtagonistC unconscious in the storeroom . Do not call the cops . ProtagonistC 's going to get you back on your feet . Might take a while .  < nl > Edit : < nl > Since people have asked < nl > Persona Non Grata ( ships of valor book 1 ) < nl > Aaron Kennedy < nl > Available on amazon ( preview enabled ) and amazon unlimited ( free to read for members ) < nl > Thank you all for the kind words and support ! < nl > Edit 2 - Added  The Flipside  which is the  Owners  side of the story < eos > 
< sos > The Hall of Heroes was one of the few types of places where images of people were permitted to be displayed . < nl > The  Hall  were composed of several dozen corridors not unlike this one : as wide as a street and long as a block , lined with terrifyingly accurate icons , some no larger than my palm but some bigger than my outstretched arms . < nl > I asked ProtagonistA why only some were in color . < nl > ProtagonistA explained that the grey icons represented those who had passed on , whose destinies were complete and thus their place in the Hall solidified . < nl > But the fate of those in color had yet to pass , so they were subject to move to more or less favorable positions and their portraits could even change size . A directory was needed to find them . < nl > ProtagonistA dialed a few keys on the directory and brought us to ProtagonistB . < nl > ProtagonistB was beyond the realm of man , ProtagonistA said , moving so far and so fast that fate could not keep up with ProtagonistB , and thus ProtagonistB had hardly experienced more years than ProtagonistA had , even though ProtagonistB first ventured towards the stars over a hundred years ago . < nl > ProtagonistB's icon was far from the most impressive . But ProtagonistA asked me to pray with ProtagonistA anyways , before an icon of ProtagonistC . Not just for ProtagonistC's sake , but for the sake of us all . Fate guide ProtagonistC to our salvation . < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA had an intimate knowledge of healing the human body . By day , ProtagonistA was a nurse at the local hospital , and ProtagonistA's hours were filled with checking in on patients , changing gauzes and bedpans , listening to grouses and complaints , and generally trying to keep as many people alive as possible . More experienced than most doctors , ProtagonistA was the name most frequently buzzed on the intercom when an emergency beckoned . < nl > Which was why ProtagonistA was slightly ticked off when ProtagonistB steadfastly refused ProtagonistA's offers of first aid . < nl >  What do ProtagonistB mean , ProtagonistB 're fine ?  asked ProtagonistA , adopting the same tone ProtagonistA used for small children and obstinate adults .  Look at the wound ! It 's bleeding out onto the carpet , for goodness sakes ! Whoever told ProtagonistB that tissue paper was a good way to staunch bloodflow ?  < nl >  It 's just a small cut ,  said ProtagonistB , turning ProtagonistB's body away from ProtagonistA . Fresh spots of blood were already blooming through the thick wad of Kleenex ProtagonistB had slapped onto ProtagonistB's arm , threatening to trickle down and ruin the floorboards . < nl > ProtagonistA clucked ProtagonistA's tongue , then pressed forward , ignoring the grumpy protests . Just before ProtagonistA touched ProtagonistB's skin , ProtagonistA channelled the faintest amount of energy into ProtagonistA's fingertips . ProtagonistA wanted to calm ProtagonistB down , aid the healing process , but ProtagonistA did n't want the effect to be so pronounced that it would give away the fact that ProtagonistA was Talented . < nl > It worked , after a fashion . ProtagonistB stopped struggling , then moodily looked on as ProtagonistA finished the dressing . < nl >  Work accident ?  ProtagonistA asked . < nl >  Yea , kind of ,  ProtagonistB said .  Thanks , ProtagonistB guess . But there was no need to , ProtagonistB would have healed , really .  < nl >  That 's what they all say ,  said ProtagonistA .  If ProtagonistA ask ProtagonistB how ProtagonistB got it , would ProtagonistB tell ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistA need to know so that ProtagonistA can get ProtagonistB the right medication .  < nl > The injury was a serious one , not life - threatening , but certainly grave enough to warrant stitches . ProtagonistA was tempted to simply close the wound ProtagonistA , bind it together with magical fibres , shorten what would have taken nature a couple of weeks to perhaps a few seconds , tops . That was out of the question , of course , as long as ProtagonistA did n't have ProtagonistA's mask on . < nl >  It looks like ProtagonistB got cut by a heated blade , or something like that ,  said ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's mind had already discarded the only other possibility , which was contact with an energy pulse , which was impossible given that ProtagonistB was still here , alive .  Is ProtagonistB's workplace unsafe ? You can report such things , you know .  < nl > ProtagonistB barked out a short laugh .  Hah ,  ProtagonistB said ,  more dangerous than ProtagonistA can imagine . But someone 's got ta do what ProtagonistB do , and there 's no use complainin ' . Are ProtagonistA done fussin ' ? ProtagonistB 've only got a couple of hours before ProtagonistB head out , and ProtagonistB would rather just rest in peace .  < nl > A scowl crossed ProtagonistA's face .  ProtagonistA know ProtagonistA should mind ProtagonistA's own business , but ProtagonistB ... ProtagonistB 've got to have healthier habits , ProtagonistB know . ProtagonistB's late nights , ProtagonistB's frequent injuries , ProtagonistB keeping to ProtagonistB in ProtagonistB's dark room all the time ... the rest of the roommates are fine with ProtagonistB wanting to be left alone , but do try and reach out to others a bit more . It 'll do ProtagonistB a world of good to -  < nl > The speed at which ProtagonistB lunged forward caught ProtagonistA by surprise , and if ProtagonistA had a hair 's less control over ProtagonistA's reflexes , ProtagonistA would have thrown up an energy shield , fried ProtagonistB on the spot . Instead , ProtagonistB merely bumped past ProtagonistA , rocking ProtagonistA back , as ProtagonistB leapt towards the television , turning up the volume . < nl >  It 's them ,  ProtagonistB said ,  they 're at it again .  < nl > ProtagonistA recognised the scene immediately . Jameson Park , where the anti - government protestors had gathered again , despite all warnings by the government to disperse . The anti - riot police were out in force too , forming a single barricade between the protestors and City Hall . Behind the anti - riot police were huge , ominous shapes , each gleaming in the sun - the Rampagers , metallic monstrosities created by the Tinkerer from the League of Heroes , meant to help maintain law and order in the city . < nl >  ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistC said ProtagonistC would negotiate peacefully with them ?  ProtagonistA asked . Had ProtagonistA missed some development in the news ? Had ProtagonistA been so caught up with work again that ProtagonistA failed to keep up with what was happening ? < nl >  The bastards ,  said ProtagonistB , face scrunched in anger .  ProtagonistB told them , not this way , do it another way , but noooo , they would n't listen ...  < nl > The camera zoomed in on a protestor hurling a water bottle at the police barricade . It struck ProtagonistD awkwardly on the head , and although ProtagonistD's helmet was reinforced , ProtagonistD fell like a rock . Even before ProtagonistD's body hit the ground , ProtagonistD's fellow officers had already surged forward , stun batons in hand , striking in retaliation . < nl > That single incident , that flame to open gasoline , sparked a convulsive tremor through the crowd . ProtagonistA watched , horrified , as the two masses crashed together . The darkened eyes of the Rampagers lit up ominously . < nl >  Is it so hard to just listen to the citizens , give them what they want ?  asked ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's voice dropping to a whisper . < nl >  Fools ,  said ProtagonistB .  The government does care , but no one gives them a chance . You toil all day to make their lives better , but the moment something goes wrong , the moment a single oversight occurs , they overreact like we 're oppressing them .  < nl >  It 's just ...  said ProtagonistA , reaching for the right words .  It 's just that sometimes the government does seem ... heavy - handed , you know ? Like they only care about the big picture , but they forget that society 's made up of all these small , individual , yet still important , parts ...  < nl > ProtagonistB slammed the television with ProtagonistB's hand , knocking off the snowglobe they kept on top of it . The snowglobe shattered on the ground , spilling its flakes across the floor .  The individual is selfish , ProtagonistA . Remember that . The government knows best , and it is better that way , trust ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB 've seen worse .  < nl > The violence on the screen escalated , as could be seen by the fiery Molotov cocktails being lobbed by the crowd , and the mind - control beams being engaged by the Rampagers . An emergency broadcast message flashed across the screen , notifying all civilians to stay away from Jameson Park , and also listing a string of numbers to call for help . < nl > Then , a laser beam shot out of the crowd , either from an unregistered Talented or a smuggled energy cannon . The beam coursed right through one of the Rampagers , sundering its protective armor , spilling its electrical guts out . It convulsed , then froze , then crashed to the ground . The protestors , galvanized by this momentary victory , cheered , then redoubled their efforts to raze City Hall to the ground . < nl > At that moment , a single silver symbol appeared at the bottom of the screen . < nl > The emblem of the League of Heroes , a call for the Talented to gather , to lend their strength to the government . < nl > ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB's watch buzz , and ProtagonistB quickly covered it with ProtagonistB's good hand .  ProtagonistB 've ... got to go ,  ProtagonistB said , as ProtagonistB turned his watch away from ProtagonistA's eyes .  ProtagonistB's ... boss is calling . Got a last - minute request to ... fix one of the machines at work , it seems .  < nl > ProtagonistA sighed , then went in search of the dustpan . Someone could get hurt , stepping on the shards of the ruined snowglobe .  Just do n't overuse that arm , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said .  The wound will open again , and ProtagonistB 'll have more trouble then .  < nl > ProtagonistA waited until ProtagonistB disappeared into ProtagonistB's room again , and ignored ProtagonistB as ProtagonistB emerged with a heavy box . ProtagonistA occupied ProtagonistA with cleaning up the mess as ProtagonistB rushed out the door , muttering curses along the way . < nl > When ProtagonistA was sure ProtagonistB had gone , that no one could hear ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA stalked back to ProtagonistA's room , threw open ProtagonistA's wardrobe , keyed in the secret combination , and grimaced as hidden panels unfolded to reveal ProtagonistA's disguise . < nl > This was a far cry from when ProtagonistA had an entire lair under the city lake , but this would have to do . < nl > ProtagonistA's heart ached as the sounds of the newscast drifted in from the living room . ProtagonistA reckoned that by the time ProtagonistA got there , the Rampagers would have already stilled over a hundred people , and that was n't even counting the hundreds more beaten into submission by the police , the very people sworn to protect and serve the public . < nl >  War never ends , does it ,  said Rachel , otherwise known as the Witch Doctor , bounty of $ 25 million , third in command of the Insufferables , the underground resistance made up of all Talented deemed unaligned with the interests of the government . < nl > ProtagonistA opened a portal , grit ProtagonistA's teeth , then stepped through it . < nl > --- < nl > /r / rarelyfunny < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA stood dumbstruck by the sight in ProtagonistA's front yard . A small black horse stood neighing and stamping it 's hooves in the melting snow . When ProtagonistA say horse , it had blue flame in place of a mane and tail and as it stamped small flares leapt from it 's hooves . < nl >  ProtagonistA , why is ProtagonistE on fire ?  ProtagonistB's voice broke ProtagonistA's frozen mind . < nl >  Umm , ProtagonistB , as much as ProtagonistA would love to give ProtagonistB an explanation on what a nightmare is right now , ProtagonistA am a little held up on the fact that ProtagonistA could have asked for one apparently years ago and ProtagonistA would have gotten one so please give ProtagonistA a moment to collect ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA stared down at the letter that was left taped to the door specifically the sender line : ProtagonistC .  Uhh , ProtagonistB can ProtagonistB tell ProtagonistA how to spell ProtagonistD ?  < nl >  S ?  < nl >  Yep .  < nl >  A , t ?  ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head slightly . < nl >  A , n ?  ProtagonistB finished and looked at ProtagonistA quizically . < nl > ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head again .  Sorry ProtagonistB , that 's , that 's not right .  < nl >  But that 's what the letter says .  ProtagonistB pouted . < nl >  ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB , but that 's how ProtagonistB spell ProtagonistC .  < nl >  Ohhh .  ProtagonistB giggled .  S , a , n , t , a.  ProtagonistB said proudly . < nl >  Very good . When ProtagonistB sent ProtagonistB's letter to ProtagonistD , did ProtagonistB check ProtagonistB's spelling ? Or were ProtagonistB too excited and just sent it ?  < nl >  ProtagonistB 'm sorry ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB pouted looking down . < nl >  No , no it 's not ProtagonistB's fault . Okay let 's , well actually ProtagonistB stay , ProtagonistA 'll approach ProtagonistE .  ProtagonistA stepped off the the porch and cautiously moved closer to the flaming horse . It turned to stare at ProtagonistA , small flames jetted from it 's nostrils as it exhaled harshly .  Hey there , little , guy .  ProtagonistA reached out a hand to which it whinnied at shaking its head and backing up . < nl >  Holy-  ProtagonistF had apparently come to check on us .  Umm , ProtagonistB ? What the hell is that ?  < nl >  It 's ProtagonistE !  ProtagonistB answered cheerfully .  It 's from , from ... ProtagonistC ! ProtagonistC 's what ProtagonistA said ProtagonistC's name was .  < nl > ProtagonistF glared at ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistC  < nl >  No what ProtagonistA said , alright , the letter says it 's from ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistB to write a letter to ProtagonistD for ProtagonistE .  ProtagonistA tried to explain .  Well at least , * ProtagonistD * delivers .  ProtagonistA half mumbled . ProtagonistF shot ProtagonistA another glare . < nl >  I love ProtagonistC !  ProtagonistB declared loudly . ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistB and then back to ProtagonistF before bursting into laughter . ProtagonistF attempted to maintain ProtagonistF's glare but soon failed joining ProtagonistA in a laugh . As ProtagonistA attempted to regain ProtagonistA's composure ProtagonistA felt a sudden heat on ProtagonistA's back and a blue fireball shot past ProtagonistA's shoulder . ProtagonistA fell to the ground and crawled backward putting distance again between ProtagonistA and the nightmare , ProtagonistB giggled at ProtagonistA . < nl >  Hey what 's this package ?  ProtagonistF asked . ProtagonistF tore open the sides and removed the contents . There was a black leather - like lead and a note : < nl > * ProtagonistB , * < nl > * ProtagonistA thank ProtagonistB for the letter , it is rare for ProtagonistA to receive one of its kind . ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistA's gift to ProtagonistB is an acceptable one , ProtagonistA agree with ProtagonistA that everyone should have fun in their life , that a fantasy is something to hope for . ProtagonistA do hope ProtagonistB enjoy this element of fantasy ProtagonistA have granted ProtagonistB . Inside is a lead suitable for ponies of his kind , ProtagonistA believe ProtagonistA is capable of explaining to ProtagonistB enough about a nightmare for ProtagonistB to properly care for ProtagonistE . * < nl > * With regards , ProtagonistB's friend , * < nl > * Satan * < nl > * P.S. ProtagonistC loves apples . * < nl > ProtagonistF read the letter outloud and looked up at ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA could tell ProtagonistF was as lost as ProtagonistA was .  Umm , ProtagonistF , how about we try and take ProtagonistE to the back so ProtagonistE does n't surprise anyone else .  < nl >  Ok .  ProtagonistF skipped down the porch and to ProtagonistE .  C'm on Blue .  ProtagonistF waved ProtagonistF's hand to ProtagonistE motioning to ProtagonistE to follow . ProtagonistE stood still staring with ProtagonistE's deep red eyes at ProtagonistF . < nl >  Oh !  ProtagonistF called out .  ProtagonistC sent an apple along .  ProtagonistF looked genuinely approving . ProtagonistF tossed the apple to ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA stood up waving the apple in ProtagonistE's face . ProtagonistE began to neigh and quickly followed . < nl >  Wait !  ProtagonistB yelled .  ProtagonistB wanna do it .  ProtagonistB whined . ProtagonistA handed ProtagonistB the apple and ProtagonistB called to it making a snapping sound with ProtagonistB's tongue . ProtagonistB took it through the gate and into the backyard . < nl > ProtagonistF hurried down the steps .  What the hell are we supposed to do with that ?  < nl >  How should ProtagonistA know , ProtagonistA do n't exactly think it comes with a return to sender address .  ProtagonistA replied . < nl >  Well anything else this Christmas ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistC to make real from ProtagonistA's books ?  ProtagonistF mocked . < nl >  Hey , ProtagonistA did n't ask for that , ProtagonistB asked for a pony , ProtagonistA said write a letter to ProtagonistD .  < nl >  Well how the hell did ProtagonistC know that quote from ProtagonistA's book ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA do n't know , maybe ProtagonistC 's a fan .  < nl >  Nice explanation , hey now it 's ProtagonistA's turn ProtagonistA 'm gon na go write a letter to ProtagonistD .  ProtagonistA gestured quotations in the air , mocking ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA want magic like Cassie 's .  < nl >  Nice choice , ProtagonistA love ProtagonistF .  ProtagonistA laughed .  Real quick though can we talk about the fact that we 're openly discussing ProtagonistC like it 's normal accepted conversation ?  < nl >  No .  ProtagonistF replied simply .  We 've got a flaming horse in our backyard .  ProtagonistF smiled and pointed over to the gate where ProtagonistB was leading ProtagonistE * in circles . < nl >  Have ProtagonistA mentioned ProtagonistA * really * love ProtagonistA .  < nl >  ProtagonistA better . We can worry more about if ProtagonistC is real later , for now let 's worry about ProtagonistB .  < nl >  ProtagonistA !  ProtagonistB screamed .  ProtagonistG sneezed and the bush is on fire !  < nl > ProtagonistA headed through the gate over to the small flame slowly heading down the branch .  Yeah , * ProtagonistA 're * gon na need to teach ProtagonistG to * not * do that .  < nl > _ < nl > [ R / TheoreticalFictions](https://www.reddit.com / r / TheoreticalFictions ) < eos > 
< sos >  ProtagonistB do n't understand !  ProtagonistA laughed . ProtagonistA , danced through the streets .  ProtagonistA 'm the richest person alive .  ProtagonistA said with a smile . < nl > ProtagonistB looked down at ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB liked to walk through these parts of the city to remind ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB grew up not more than a few blocks south . < nl > ProtagonistB thought it strange that ProtagonistA had began speaking to ProtagonistB ; out of the blue telling ProtagonistB how ProtagonistB did n't understand . Stranger still that ProtagonistA had responded quite reasonable , as if they had been having a perfectly sensible conversation all taking place inside ProtagonistB's own mind . < nl >  How do ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB do n't understand ?  ProtagonistB said as ProtagonistA skipped around ProtagonistB in circles . < nl >  Well , do * ProtagonistB * understand ?  < nl >  Understand what ?  < nl >  Exactly !  ProtagonistA said with a shriek . < nl > ProtagonistB had a feeling of familiarity with ProtagonistA , as if ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistA from a very long time ago . < nl >  Have we met before ? You and ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistB said with a hint of anxiety . < nl >  ProtagonistA 've known ProtagonistB for a very long time ago .  < nl > As ProtagonistA said this ProtagonistB felt ProtagonistB's stomach drop . ' Can ProtagonistA * hear * ProtagonistB ? ' < nl >  No no , of course ProtagonistA ca n't * hear * ProtagonistB .  < nl > As ProtagonistA said this ProtagonistA stopped circling ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA stood directly in front of ProtagonistB and gazed up with a stare that seemed to look through ProtagonistB . < nl >  ProtagonistA can hear ProtagonistB but not with these ears . ProtagonistA can see ProtagonistB but not with these eyes . Though ProtagonistB ProtagonistA have a hand in everything and without any desire ProtagonistA control all that ProtagonistB know . ProtagonistA have nothing and so everything is mine . Do ProtagonistB know who ProtagonistA am ?  < nl > ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistB speak ,  No , but ProtagonistB feel like ProtagonistB remember ProtagonistA . From a time ProtagonistB ca n't place and a place ProtagonistB ca n't remember . What is ProtagonistA's name ProtagonistA ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm not little and ProtagonistA 'm not one , two , or none . Of the light and the darkness ProtagonistA 'm the space which holds both . Of remembering and forgetting , ProtagonistA 'm the one who knows both . ProtagonistA am pure consciousness . ProtagonistA have nothing and so ProtagonistA 'm the richest person alive . ProtagonistA want nothing so ProtagonistA am given all that this world possesses . ProtagonistA was never created so ProtagonistA ca n't die . ProtagonistA am fearless ever lasting peace .  < nl >  Now tell ProtagonistB ProtagonistB , just who are ProtagonistB ?  < eos > 
< sos > Three things contributed to ProtagonistA dancing down the cobbled street , through the peppery rain and silver September evening , telling all who cared to listen that ProtagonistA was rich ; the tumour was only one of those things , and it was the one ProtagonistA did not know about . Of course , ProtagonistA felt the headaches -- how could ProtagonistA not ? The migraines had only tiptoed in their monthly rehearsals the previous year , but now they stomped almost weekly , thundering forward toward their finale . Their curtain call . * Lonesome pains * , the orphanage owner had told ProtagonistA . No need for a doctor to get involved .   They 'd go away when ProtagonistA finally found a family . When a family found ProtagonistA . < nl > Today was that day -- and it was the second reason for ProtagonistA dancing down that weathered street under the paper clouds and candle sun . ProtagonistA 'd been * found . * And the finders could n't have been more perfect . The lady had huge , kind eyes . Not beady or grey , like of those who ran the orphanage -- but fading autumn green ; welcoming , like the wavy shore of the sea calling ProtagonistA to come dip ProtagonistA's feet . Not that ProtagonistA had seen the sea . Oh and ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistB had smiled at ProtagonistA . No man had ever smiled at ProtagonistA like that . Like they 'd meant it . The scars ProtagonistA felt inside of ProtagonistA -- that ProtagonistA 'd always felt inside of ProtagonistA , had been suddenly coated by something sweet . Treacle , ProtagonistA pondered . At the very least , by something hopeful . < nl > They could have had any of the children . But they 'd chosen ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA < nl > There were papers to sign and dots to dot , crosses to cross . But they said they would be back tomorrow , and then ProtagonistA would be leaving with them . ProtagonistA could hardly stop ProtagonistA's feet from fidgeting upon hearing those words , but ProtagonistA showed restraint for a little longer -- that 's what people looked for in a child : restraint -- and ProtagonistA waited until they had left before moving . ProtagonistA scrambled to the front door after they closed it , and pressed ProtagonistA's ear firm against the oak , waiting for the rumble of the automobile to die away as the evening wind . Then , ProtagonistA snuck out . < nl > ProtagonistA had n't gone very far at all when ProtagonistA 'd found the silver coin on the side of the pavement , a glimmer of light beneath a crumbling leaf . The third and final reason . A sign from God of how ProtagonistA's life was changing -- ProtagonistA would tell all who would listen of ProtagonistA's good fortune . And so ProtagonistA danced through the peppery rain , through the satin September evening -- until the lonesome headache began , for the final time . ProtagonistA stumbled on the pavement , and almost fell . Why ,   ProtagonistA wondered , as the dancers in ProtagonistA's head began to stomp , why was it hurting still ? Perhaps it would n't stop until ProtagonistA was living with ProtagonistA's finders . ProtagonistA bit down on ProtagonistA's tongue for distraction -- nothing would ruin ProtagonistA perfect today . ProtagonistA continued down the street , not noticing how cold ProtagonistA's feet were against the cobblestone , or how numb and disobedient ProtagonistA's limbs had become .   ProtagonistA chose not to see the black dots that clouded ProtagonistA's precious evening . < nl > The curtain call arrived with a cacophony of applause . A rapturous rupture . The red of a liquid rose trickled from ProtagonistA's nose . < nl > ProtagonistA fell onto the street , ProtagonistA's head bouncing like a rubber ball with a hiss of air as it slowly deflated . The coin escaped ProtagonistA's hand as ProtagonistA's fingers peeled open , and rolled behind ProtagonistA , back toward the orphanage . < nl > People crowded about ProtagonistA as the blood pooled . Virgin red dying dirty grey . < nl > * Are ProtagonistA okay , ProtagonistA ? * came a man 's voice . < nl > * Get a doctor , * said another . * ProtagonistA , * cooed a woman . < nl > Poor ? Could n't they see ? < nl > * ProtagonistA 'm not poor , * ProtagonistA tried to explain , * not any longer * -- but ProtagonistA's lips only managed a crooked smile . < nl > --- < nl > Thank you for reading .

< sos >  You bitch !  A voice roared from upstairs , followed shortly by a loud crash .   I rolled my eyes and heaved myself to my feet .   Here we go again . < nl >  What 's wrong ?  I called wearily , making my way towards the stairs .   ProtagonistA was nonchalantly coming down , Bible in hand .   For being the incarnation of Death , ProtagonistA always seemed to be reading ProtagonistA's Bible ( which ProtagonistA had stolen from a motel room when I was n't looking .   Ironic , right ? ) . < nl >  What 're they fighting about ?  I asked ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA rounded the bannister and headed toward the kitchen . < nl >  Limos stole ProtagonistC or something stupid like that .  ProtagonistA whispered , not even looking up from ProtagonistA's book .   I sighed and rubbed the bridge of my nose as ProtagonistD came tumbling down the stairs as well . < nl >  ProtagonistB 's about to lose it !  ProtagonistB gasped , running for cover .   Just then , a lamp flew across the hallway and smashed straight through the wall . < nl >  ProtagonistB's anger issues are why ProtagonistC left ProtagonistB !  Limos screamed , appearing from ProtagonistB's room , followed < nl > promptly by ProtagonistB's flying dresser . < nl >  And ProtagonistC thought the best way to get around ProtagonistB's anger was to cheat on ProtagonistB ? !  < nl > Oh boy .   ProtagonistB 'm going to have to take a third mortgage . < nl >  Girls !   Come on , calm down !  I called up to them . < nl >  ProtagonistB is the one who needs to calm down !  Limos yelled back . < nl >  You want to reenact Troy ?  ProtagonistB continued ranting as she too appeared . < nl >  Please , ProtagonistB ca n't afford to rebuild the house again !  < nl > Suddenly , ProtagonistB seemed to gag and doubled over , dry - heaving .   ProtagonistB growled audibly and waved ProtagonistB's hand , prompting a curt scream to come from the kitchen , followed by the smoke alarm going off and ProtagonistD appearing , the tips of ProtagonistD's hair on fire . < nl >  Do n't make ProtagonistB sick !  ProtagonistB yelled , charging down the stairs after ProtagonistD . < nl >  Why are you all against ProtagonistB ? !  ProtagonistB continued ,  Who else wants to take a shot at ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistB's voice broke at the last and I could see some wetness in ProtagonistB's eyes .   Registering what ProtagonistB said , I pointed at ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA came out of the kitchen too ,  ProtagonistA stay out of this !  I ordered .   The last thing we needed was somebody 's heart stopping .   ProtagonistA just shrugged , coolly .   Ever calm . < nl >  Can you guys just work this out without destroying the neighborhood ?  I pleaded . < nl >  Oh , I 'll work it out .   I 'll work it out at ProtagonistB's funeral !  ProtagonistB lunged at Limos again , who did ProtagonistB's best to evade -- by using ProtagonistD as a human shield . < nl >  This is hardly a fair fight !  ProtagonistB cried , looking for options ,  ProtagonistA ?   Help ?  < nl >  No !   Do n't kill ProtagonistB !  < nl >  Just for a second !   We 'll bring ProtagonistB back !  Limos kept pleading . < nl > ProtagonistB waved ProtagonistB's hand and the couch behind Limos burst into flames , catching Limos 's pants on fire in the process .   I was starting to get annoyed about this all , too .   As Limos started screaming and swatting at the flames , it seemed like all the darkness in the room congealed around the flames and snuffed them out .   ProtagonistA   Putting out the fire seemed to only enrage ProtagonistB even more , though and ProtagonistB started screaming again as ProtagonistB drew on ProtagonistB's power .   ProtagonistB was about to explode , and I really ca n't afford to rebuild the house again . < nl >  ProtagonistA ,  I sighed ,  Just do it .  I looked over to see the slightest grin on ProtagonistA's usually placid face as ProtagonistA waved a hand and all three of ProtagonistA's sisters collapsed to the floor . < nl >  Bring them back in two minutes .  I ordered , trudging back over to the couch .   Out of all four of them , I 'm really glad Death is the obedient one . < eos > 
< sos >  Are ProtagonistA sure ProtagonistA want all four of them ?  ProtagonistB asked , trying unsuccessfully to keep a smile from slipping onto ProtagonistB's face . < nl > ProtagonistA nodded as ProtagonistA read the document again .  Why not ? ProtagonistB said they 're inseparable .  < nl >  They might be a bit much to ... handle . ProtagonistB mean , four kids , and these four in particular ...  < nl >  Yeah , well , ProtagonistB 've never seen ProtagonistA in a temper ,  ProtagonistA said , and reached for a pen that ProtagonistB hurried to hand ProtagonistA . < nl >  Sure , ProtagonistB do n't mean anything against ProtagonistA , but these four can be strange . Sometimes .  < nl > ProtagonistA frowned at ProtagonistB .  What 's the matter ? ProtagonistB seemed practically relieved when ProtagonistA agreed to adopt them . Now ProtagonistB 're having second thoughts ?  < nl >  No , no ... ProtagonistB 'm sure ProtagonistA 'll cope just fine .  ProtagonistB smiled , overly sweet , and pointed at the next stack of forms awaiting ProtagonistA .  Well , let 's just get these out of the way real quick , shall we ?  < nl > * * * < nl >  Well , we 're here .  ProtagonistA turned into our driveway , and the girls , who 'd been talking softly among themselves in the back of the van , fell quiet . < nl >  Wow ,  ProtagonistC said , brushing ProtagonistC's hair out of ProtagonistC's face .  It 's ... that 's a big house .  < nl >  What , did you think ProtagonistA was kidding when ProtagonistA said you 'll each have a bedroom to yourselves ?  ProtagonistA said , putting the car into park . < nl > Three answered in the negative , but ProtagonistD only glowered at them . That look lent an illusion of ProtagonistD's close - cropped auburn hair being ablaze .  Oh come on , you all thought ProtagonistA was bullshitting .  < nl >  Hey , ProtagonistA 'm right here , ProtagonistD ,  ProtagonistA said .  And do n't use that sort of language , please . Let 's get your bags inside .  < nl > ProtagonistA's daughters -- God , ProtagonistA had to get used to saying that in ProtagonistA's head -- refused ProtagonistA's help with their luggage , and trooped after ProtagonistA in silence as we walked up the driveway . Not that they were sullen or anything ; ProtagonistA had the impression that they were still trying to process the Harley , the fountain , and the-- < nl >  Holy crap , is that a Ferrari ?  ProtagonistD said . < nl > ProtagonistA sighed , but said nothing . Then ProtagonistE tapped ProtagonistA on the arm ; ProtagonistA tried not to jump at how cold ProtagonistE's fingers felt . It was ProtagonistF .  It 's really quiet here .  < nl >  Bout thirty minutes from the nearest town ,  ProtagonistA replied as ProtagonistA unlocked the front door . < nl >  ProtagonistA 'd know if ProtagonistA had n't been sleeping on our drive here ,  ProtagonistD said in a bossy tone , but was interrupted by a bout of coughing . < nl >  Okay okay ,  ProtagonistA said , before ProtagonistF could retort , but ProtagonistF only drifted into the house in silence before ProtagonistA . The rest followed , and then ProtagonistA shut the door behind us . < nl >  Welcome home ,  ProtagonistA said . < nl >  Er ... ProtagonistA ? What is it ProtagonistA do for a living again ?  ProtagonistC said , staring open - mouthed at the mini - chandelier over the living room . < nl > ProtagonistA smiled and put ProtagonistA's arms around them .  ProtagonistA run ProtagonistA's own company . Now , let 's go get you settled .  < nl > * * * < nl > For what felt like the dozenth time in just three months , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA walking in the hallways of Far Meadow High School again . ProtagonistA knew the way and the amount of time required to reach ProtagonistD's classroom so well , ProtagonistA had begun scheduling business calls to fill up the time . < nl > ProtagonistG met ProtagonistA with a look of frustrated concern .  It 's a nosebleed this time ,  ProtagonistG said , ProtagonistD standing behind ProtagonistG with a tissue to ProtagonistD's nose . < nl > ProtagonistA heaved a sigh .  Guess ProtagonistA 'll take ProtagonistD's home for the day .  < nl > As usual , ProtagonistD wore a look of guilt all the way to the car , which slowly turned into one of relief .  Math lesson is so boring ,  ProtagonistD said , crumpling the blood - stained tissue up and putting it into a pocket . < nl > ProtagonistA scowled .  We 've been over this . Just because ProtagonistD 've studied three lessons ahead and done all the exercises , it does n't mean ProtagonistD can skip classes . Next time ProtagonistD pull this nosebleed or stomach cramp nonsense again , ProtagonistA might just leave ProtagonistD there .  < nl > ProtagonistD's eyes widened in the rear view mirror .  But ProtagonistD might die ! The other kids might catch what ProtagonistD have . Remember that time ProtagonistD puked ProtagonistD's guts out ? Please do n't leave ProtagonistD , ProtagonistD do n't want to die in that dumb class !  < nl >  As the eldest , what do ProtagonistD think ProtagonistD's sisters might think if ProtagonistD get to skip classes all the time ?  < nl >  Pfah . ProtagonistD 's got ProtagonistH , no way ProtagonistD 's going home unless ProtagonistH 's not there . ProtagonistC 's really popular , ProtagonistC 's like some diet expert or something so all the cool girls want to hang out with ProtagonistC .  < nl > ProtagonistA nodded absently , thinking about the board meeting ProtagonistA would have to miss this afternoon . < nl >  --and ProtagonistF's 's a weirdo in school , you know . ProtagonistF keeps dead spiders inside a box and shows them to everyone . Claims ProtagonistF killed them with ProtagonistF's thoughts .  < nl >  Is ProtagonistF being bullied for that ?  ProtagonistA said , an edge in ProtagonistA's tone . < nl >  Nah , ProtagonistD think most people are scared of ProtagonistF or something .  ProtagonistD had whipped ProtagonistD's smartphone out .  Do n't think they even know why . ProtagonistD told some of ProtagonistD's friends about the time ProtagonistF got lost in the woods for half a day--  < nl >  Not a funny story to share ,  ProtagonistA said through gritted teeth . < nl >  --or the time ProtagonistF hid a dead rabbit inside ProtagonistD's closet--  < nl >  Still not funny .  < nl >  --what a mess , all that screaming and stuff being thrown about , you 'd think--  < nl >  ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA 'll take ProtagonistD to a doctor ,  ProtagonistA said . < nl > Not a peep was heard from ProtagonistD the rest of the way home . < nl > * * * < nl >  What now ?  ProtagonistA said , marching into ProtagonistK's office . ProtagonistF was there , sitting in a corner staring off into nothing . < nl >  ProtagonistI , has been telling ProtagonistJ all morning , that ProtagonistJ was going to die before the day 's end .  ProtagonistK had ProtagonistK's burly arms crossed as ProtagonistK glared at ProtagonistI .  ProtagonistK do not tolerate ProtagonistK's students threatening one another in ProtagonistK's school !  < nl >  It 's not a threat , ProtagonistI 's just a bit distracted at times ,  ProtagonistA said hurriedly , going to ProtagonistI and hugging ProtagonistI .  ProtagonistI's filter just goes offline , you know .  < nl >  Well , ProtagonistJ is having a nervous breakdown right now in the med room , and ProtagonistK do n't need ProtagonistJ to see ProtagonistI anymore today . Take ProtagonistI's home , please .  < nl >  ProtagonistI , what 's gotten into ProtagonistI ?  ProtagonistA said as ProtagonistA escorted ProtagonistI out of the school .  Dead animals is one thing , but you ca n't say such things to your friends !  < nl >  ProtagonistJ 's not really a friend ,  ProtagonistI said cheerfully .  Anyway , ProtagonistI was just messing with ProtagonistJ . ProtagonistJ took ProtagonistI's box away and hid it , ProtagonistI was in such a fright . Do n't worry , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistJ 'll die three years from today .  < nl > * * * < nl > ProtagonistL , shook ProtagonistL's head at ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA showed up outside the school gates . < nl >  This is beyond ProtagonistL ,  ProtagonistL said .  The police will be here soon .  < nl > A full blown riot was taking place in the school yard ; children armed with chairs and textbooks going at each other with fury . There was no order to it , no sides as far as ProtagonistA could tell . < nl > Only two people were n't fighting ; ProtagonistI and ProtagonistD , sitting on a bench . ProtagonistI was giggling and pointing at nobody in particular , while ProtagonistD had ProtagonistD's face buried in homework . < nl > ProtagonistA walked to them and said ,  What the hell is going on ? ProtagonistA got a call from ProtagonistK saying--  < nl >  ProtagonistC stole ProtagonistD's boyfriend , so they 're fighting ,  ProtagonistD said . < nl > ProtagonistA's girls -- ProtagonistA's beautiful sixteen - year - old daughters , whom ProtagonistA treasured more than anything in the world -- made ProtagonistA want to pull ProtagonistA's hair out sometimes . < nl >  So why is the entire school fighting ?  ProtagonistA said . < nl >  Because ProtagonistD controls half of the school , and ProtagonistC the other half .  < nl >  ProtagonistA , do n't stop them , please ,  ProtagonistI said , ProtagonistI gaze suddenly sharpening .  ProtagonistI think someone might actually die today .  < nl >  Is that so ?  ProtagonistA said softly . ProtagonistA's daughters froze , and then jammed their fingers into their ears . < nl > Then ProtagonistA bellowed ,  ProtagonistC and Amber Christian , you stop this madness at once !  < nl > Silence fell upon the entire school -- even the sirens outside felt diminished . A hundred heads turned ProtagonistA's way , and ProtagonistA finally spotted the troublesome duo at the heart of it , their hands around each other 's throats . < nl >  For three years -- three damned years -- I've been putting up with your little quirks and visiting this school like ProtagonistA 'm enrolled here ProtagonistA , but you just made ProtagonistA miss an important flight today . ProtagonistA 'm going to count to three , and if you do n't come here by that time , ProtagonistA 'm leaving you back where ProtagonistA found you .  < nl > No sooner had ProtagonistA said it than ProtagonistC and ProtagonistD scurried to ProtagonistA , red - faced and crying . ProtagonistA added shock to their expressions when ProtagonistA slapped each of them once , before drawing them both into a hug . < nl >  Girls , ProtagonistA would like to think ProtagonistA raised you better than to fight over boys -- and start a school riot while you 're at it .  < nl > They babbled in protest , but ProtagonistA hushed them .  Enough . ProtagonistA wish this never happened , but there will be consequences for today .  < nl >  ProtagonistA , what will they do to us ?  ProtagonistD whispered . < nl >  ProtagonistA do n't know . But ProtagonistA promise ProtagonistD one thing--  ProtagonistA brushed ProtagonistD's hair and kissed ProtagonistC's cheek .  ProtagonistA 'll be there with ProtagonistD .  < nl > * * * < nl > * Check out ProtagonistA's [ sub](http://reddit.com / r / nonsenselocker ) for more stories ! * < eos > 
< sos > There 's nothing that strange about them at first ; it 's the same sad story you always hear . Abandoned by their parents , kicked around from this shelter to that one , one foster place to another . There were always problems and the girls never stayed anywhere very long . < nl > But problem children were your specialty . ( Or so you used to believe . ) You could n't always make a difference , but you tried . You tried to be there when no one else was . You tried to see the good in them when everyone else had given up . Your ex always said you had a martyr   complex and maybe they were right , and maybe that 's why you fell for them to begin with . Does n't matter . < nl > What matters are the four girls you adopted . The paperwork says they 're sisters and that 's the only way you 'd know . ProtagonistA is albino , sickly and pale . Life with ProtagonistA is a whirlwind of doctor 's appointments and prescription medicines , specialists and itemized lists of all the things ProtagonistA ca n't do . But none of it seems to help , and the only noticeable difference is your shrinking bank account . You learn to keep ProtagonistA away from other people pretty early on , as nearly everything ProtagonistA has is contagious in one way or another . < nl > You try to do for ProtagonistA anyway . You bring ProtagonistA's books and movies and activities ProtagonistA can engage in from ProtagonistA's bed . You get ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA's own computer so ProtagonistA can have access to the internet . You hire nurses , plan family outings around days when ProtagonistA 's feeling better . You research hospital locations in advance . ProtagonistA 's not a bad girl . Sweet , in ProtagonistA's own way . It 's not ProtagonistA's fault ProtagonistA 's sick all the time . Unfortunately , it means you are too . < nl > The second one is- well . ProtagonistA 's your problem child . A problem child among problem children . Wild and red - haired with a temper like a bonfire ... you ca n't control ProtagonistA . No one can control ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA has a way of instigating things , bringing out the worst in the people around ProtagonistA . But the thing that really bothers you is ProtagonistA always has a reason why it 's someone else 's fault . Always a litany of ways to justify ProtagonistA's actions . It was those Other People , ProtagonistA tells you . Those Other People , and the things they did . ProtagonistA has ProtagonistA's reasons and if you listen to ProtagonistA long enough , ProtagonistA's reasons will become yours . ProtagonistA 'll convince you ProtagonistA was in the right . You stop listening to ProtagonistA's excuses because it 's all you can do . < nl > You try to love ProtagonistA anyway , to show ProtagonistA a different way , fill up that angry heart with something better . Unfortunately , ProtagonistA can bring out the worst in you as well . < nl > ProtagonistA is dark haired and dark skinned and much too thin . The doctor says it 's anorexia . You take ProtagonistA to meetings , to support groups . You beg with ProtagonistA to eat . You try to fix ProtagonistA's favorite foods . < nl > None of it helps . ProtagonistA 's too thin , bones sticking out everywhere , skin pulled tight . ProtagonistA 'd make a great Halloween costume you think , and then you cry as you scrape the food into the garbage where it goes to waste . Unfortunately , you 're starting to hate food too , just from the stress of it all . You dread mealtimes now . < nl > Then there 's ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 's quiet like the eldest but healthy , or so you assume . ProtagonistA does n't break the rules like ProtagonistA's ProtagonistA , or refuse to eat . ProtagonistA also does n't talk . Ever . The doctors say there 's no physical reason they can find , that it must be psychosomatic and given who ProtagonistA 's related to you think that 's a safe bet . < nl > And yet , for all of that ProtagonistA 's the one that unsettles you the most . The file you got said ProtagonistA 's the youngest but sometimes you wonder . There 's something * old * in ProtagonistA's eyes and when you catch ProtagonistA staring at you it raises the hackles on the back of your neck .   ProtagonistA does n't appear to be interested in anything at all . Not in books or movies or games or other people . ProtagonistA seems politely disinterested with the world ; bored but serene .   ProtagonistA eats what you put in front of ProtagonistA and you ca n't say whether ProtagonistA enjoys it or not . ProtagonistA goes to bed at the same time every night . ProtagonistA obeys every rule ProtagonistA 's given and it freaks you out a bit , because   there 's something completely otherworldly about ProtagonistA , and you have no idea how to reach ProtagonistA . Sometimes you think ProtagonistA 's amused by all the little rules and silly rituals humans have , but then you catch yourself thinking that way and stop . You do n't even know where those thoughts come from . < nl > You 're under a lot of stress , is all . < nl > Then it all hits the fan the night your red - head daughter brings home a boy . < nl > ( will continue later , am tired ) < eos > 
< sos >  Look , ProtagonistA , like ... ProtagonistA just was n't good enough for ProtagonistB . OK ?  < nl >  Yeah , ProtagonistB guess ... ProtagonistA seemed nice though .  < nl > Nice . ProtagonistA comes charging into my palace dragging a terrified octogenarian in white robes clutching a wooden staff for dear life and a teenage girl with a bargain - basement spell book who looked like ProtagonistC was positively shitting ProtagonistC , dressed all up in holy plate armor , shouting obscenities about the  fucking filthy bastard abomination piece of shit demons  ProtagonistA was going to  disembowel  while ProtagonistA's  cleric  and  white mage  tried to keep from being eaten by the palace decor and scrambled to remember the three spells they 'd memorized in the panic of it all . Super nice guy . < nl >  Your infernal highness ,  ProtagonistD said as ProtagonistD approached the throne .  ProtagonistD have a report .  < nl >  Is it about the ... um , are we calling ProtagonistA a paladin ? Is that what we 're doing ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA was wearing the regalia of the Holy Order , your great dark majesty .  < nl >  It just seems like such a loaded term . You know , we 're trying to get away from this whole us versus them rhetoric , be more tolerant , watch our microaggressions , eat fewer babies - you know , a better demon king for a better demon world .  < nl >  Yes , your magnificent wickedness , and I am honored to serve such a respectable lord of darkness , but the ... um , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's companions , sire ...  < nl >  Right , your report .  < nl >  Should ProtagonistB really be present for this , sire ?  < nl >  Oh , go on , ProtagonistE ,  ProtagonistB said , resting ProtagonistB's head in ProtagonistB's right hand as ProtagonistB tried to get more comfortable in ProtagonistB's seat next to the throne ,  ProtagonistB 've heard much worse . Trust ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB's father has all of the eunuchs who attend ProtagonistB castrated with string and bits of glass .  Igzaril - that was ProtagonistE's name ; ProtagonistB 'd been calling ProtagonistA ' Sir Sexy Horns ' for so long in ProtagonistB's head ProtagonistB 'd forgotten - shuddered at the thought and then nodded . < nl >  Entrails , sire . The hell hounds in the lobby did a spectacular job of ending ProtagonistA's ... crusade ? Can ProtagonistB still say crusade ?  < nl >  Let 's go with mission to be safe .  < nl >  Well , anyway , while the hounds were happy to tear ProtagonistA apart ,  and that 's when ProtagonistB interrupted ProtagonistA , growing suddenly agitated by the entire situation . It had been sixteen months since the king of ... whatever the human cesspool above ground and due East of here was called had orchestrated the  kidnapping  of ProtagonistB in the desperately lazy attempt at finding a  worthy  and  honorable  man to marry ProtagonistB . And kill ProtagonistB . That was also big on his political agenda . Great way to score points with the Holy Order - kill Lord Zabuliz the Unkillable Evil . Ignore the  unkillable  part of ProtagonistB's name entirely . Focus on the last word . Humans . < nl >  Just call ProtagonistA the ' guy , ' or something . Paladin is too political , but ' gentleman ' is giving ProtagonistA entirely too much credit .  < nl >  Yes , sire . Well , the guy who attacked - oh you 're right , that does feel a lot better - and his support team must have drank a rather impressive amount of holy water just before storming the palace . The hell hounds all have pretty badly singed snouts , ProtagonistE 'm afraid .  < nl >  Oh no !  ProtagonistB said at once , sitting up straight with ProtagonistB's eyes open and look a genuine concern for the cute - albeit snarling , ferocious , wreathed in flame , and almost constantly dripping with the blood of the innocent - hell hounds that stood guard on the lower levels - the only levels of the palace that any of ProtagonistB's potential suitors had ever made it to . We ran a tight ship .  Are the puppies alright ?  < nl >  They 'll be fine , ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistE said , bowing to conceal an obvious smile ,  they just might be sulking for a while . If another attack comes in soon we might actually have to send in personnel to deal with the situation .  < nl >  How well staffed is the lobby ?  < nl >  Well , there 's ProtagonistF and usually four to six guards posted . We could up the number of guards if you 'd like , sire , maybe give a few of the more industrious imps something useful to do , but ProtagonistF - has been complaining that ProtagonistF 's getting a bit bored at ProtagonistF's desk and ProtagonistF 's actually an impressively skilled magician - necromancy , mostly , although ProtagonistE think ProtagonistE saw mastery of elemental conjuration and classical malediction on ProtagonistF's CV . With the caliber of magic users that have been coming through on palad ... 'good guy ' support ProtagonistE 'm confident ProtagonistF 'd be more than a match . ProtagonistF 'd probably have them eating hellfire the moment they step through the door .  < nl >  Well , that 's serendipitous to say the least . Inform ... was it Fuhlazmin ?  < nl >  ProtagonistF , your unparalleled malevolence .  < nl >  Let ProtagonistF know ProtagonistF 'll be getting a raise . I 'll think of a new title as well . All I 've got in my head right now is ' battle secretary ' and that 's hot garbage .  < nl >  There is another problem , ProtagonistB's immortal oppressor of the light ,  ProtagonistE said , and ProtagonistB sunk instinctively back in ProtagonistB's throne so far that ProtagonistB's wings got all mashed up and ProtagonistB's tail squished against the seat in a manner so painful that ProtagonistB had to instantly adjust .  The holy water that the guy and his companions drank . Their entrails splattered against the walls of the lobby . Steaming with holy magic .  < nl >  Ugh ,  ProtagonistB said , putting a clawed hand to ProtagonistB's forehead . ProtagonistB felt a migraine coming on right behind ProtagonistB's horns .  And no one can clean it up without getting burned , right ?  < nl >  ProtagonistB 'll do it ,  ProtagonistB said , standing up and walking towards the door without a second word . ProtagonistB sounded happy , perhaps excited even to have something to do besides sit around and wait to be rescued , and even looked back once   and smiled before disappearing through the gate of lost souls down the stairwell through the chamber of horrors and the tunnel of unrelenting evil that led past the cafeteria to the broom closet where ProtagonistB 'd presumably - hopefully - break out the purple stuff and the good mop . < nl >  ProtagonistB 's great ,  ProtagonistE said once ProtagonistB was out of the throne room .  Really . It 's been lovely having ProtagonistB around .  < nl >  ProtagonistB know . ProtagonistB 'd marry ProtagonistB ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB were n't so fucking gay .  < nl > EDIT : Wow , ProtagonistB did not respect this kind of response , thank you all so much ! ProtagonistB 'll post a Part 2 as a reply to this comment . ProtagonistB hope you guys enjoy it as well ! < nl > EDIT 2 : Again , WOW . ProtagonistB really did not expect this to blow up . For ProtagonistB's first ( ProtagonistB think ProtagonistB's first ? ) post on this sub , ProtagonistB was optimistically hoping for double digit upvotes at best , so THANK YOU ALL again ! ProtagonistB will definitely continue this story - ProtagonistB have absolutely no clue what ProtagonistB's next step is going to be aside from ProtagonistB writing and posting it ( somewhere ? somehow ? someone help ? advice ? ) but ProtagonistB obviously have an audience here and ProtagonistB love this story so far so ProtagonistB will definitely give you guys more . As in hopefully tomorrow more . Thanks again ! < nl > EDIT 3 : ( Last one , really ) OK so for the time being ProtagonistB am going to be posting the continuation of this story directly on ProtagonistB's profile until ProtagonistB find a better place to stick them , so - can ProtagonistB even ask people to subscribe to ProtagonistB's profile ? Is that soliciting ? Will a Mod come strike ProtagonistB down ? Anyway , for now , Parts 1 and 2 ( and tomorrow , Part 3 ! ) of  The Infinite Darkness of Lord Zabuliz the Unkillable Evil ( And Friends ! )  will be posted directly on ProtagonistB's profile , /u / bochibochi < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistB showed up at ProtagonistA's doorstep . The doorbell pinged anxiously . < nl >  Who is it ?  ProtagonistA yelled . The chair ProtagonistA sat in sagged . Silence followed . < nl > The doorbell squawked again , against its will . ProtagonistB began pressing it again and again . The color seemed to disappear around ProtagonistB . < nl > ProtagonistA stood up and ProtagonistA's chair groaned . The brown leather seemed to gray with each step ProtagonistA took towards the door . < nl >  What do ProtagonistB want ?  ProtagonistA asked as ProtagonistA grabbed the knob of the door .  ProtagonistA do n't have any appointments ProtagonistB ...  ProtagonistA's voice caught in ProtagonistA's throat . < nl > ProtagonistB wore a USA Today badge . ProtagonistB's gray pantsuit wore ProtagonistB's body well . ProtagonistB nodded courteously . < nl >  ProtagonistB 'm here for ProtagonistA . Is that ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB's voice was clear , but the area surrounding ProtagonistB's body seemed to dampen everything ever so slightly . < nl >  Yes ,  ProtagonistA replied after processing ProtagonistB's request . Then asked,What do ProtagonistB want ?  < nl >  Just a second . ProtagonistB 'd prefer to keep ProtagonistB's shoes on . ProtagonistB hope that 's alright wth ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB begin to walk forward . < nl > ProtagonistA hesitated , but ProtagonistB was already halfway through ProtagonistA's door . ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA sitting back where ProtagonistA had been . ProtagonistB sat across from ProtagonistA . < nl > The leather chair was ProtagonistB now . And it definitely seemed gray . Everything seemed gray to ProtagonistA , right now . < nl >  ProtagonistB want to show ProtagonistA something .  ProtagonistB took ProtagonistB's phone out of ProtagonistB's pocket .  We started a report a few weeks ago .  < nl > ProtagonistB continued to talk , but the noise became less and less distinguishable . ProtagonistA heard something about 1000 people , and maybe ProtagonistC's name . The grayness around ProtagonistA grew louder and ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's gaze drifting . < nl >  Hello ?  ProtagonistB snapped ProtagonistB's fingers in front of ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA barely moved . < nl > How is this possible , ProtagonistB thought . The stories thy had all heard about ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC . Right in front of ProtagonistB . They could n't have been lying . They had done everything randomly . It was impossible . < nl >  ProtagonistC changed ProtagonistB's life ,  most had said . < nl >  I would n't be here if it were n't for ProtagonistC ,  said others . < nl > A thousand thoughts flashed before ProtagonistB's eyes , and ProtagonistB buried ProtagonistB's doubt . ProtagonistB would report ProtagonistB's story and be done with it . ProtagonistB had known something was up . At least ProtagonistB 'd be able to move on from this ridiculousness that had started everyone in the office to sharing stories about being saved . < nl >  ProtagonistB am who ProtagonistB am now , because of ProtagonistA .  < nl > ProtagonistC sat in front of ProtagonistB . Looking dull . Everything was gray . < nl > ProtagonistC's lungs filled with all the everything , and ProtagonistC held it for just a second . < nl > ProtagonistB tilted ProtagonistB's head . Shifting ProtagonistB's brows . < nl > As ProtagonistC exhaled , all of the color came back . ProtagonistB had n't noticed . ProtagonistB had never noticed . Everything was so vibrant . < nl > A tear rolled down ProtagonistB's cheek . < nl > They had all been right . < eos > 
< sos > Sitting alone in ProtagonistA's room , ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes , wishing whoever had just rang the doorbell would just leave . ProtagonistA was n't feeling up to dealing with people today . ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistC . There was just one problem with that . < nl > ProtagonistA see dead people . < nl > Well , * almost * dead people , to be accurate . It 's ProtagonistA's own morbid miracle , a gift or a curse depending on the day . < nl > It started when ProtagonistA was small , venturing out of the house with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA would point and scream happily , begging ProtagonistB to look . It 's another person ! At first ProtagonistB ignored it . In later years ProtagonistB wrote it off as imagination . Not long after that ProtagonistA had learned not to bring it up . For ProtagonistA , seeing a stranger on the street was exciting . For ProtagonistB , it was cruel . ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistA could n't see anything in the darkness , and ProtagonistA claiming ProtagonistA could see people seemed like a cry of desperation ; ProtagonistA wished ProtagonistA could see people , so ProtagonistA convinced ProtagonistA that ProtagonistA did . ProtagonistA had never discovered the mystery of why ProtagonistA can see certain strangers , but it had become ProtagonistA's normal . < nl > Until last year . ProtagonistA's family had gone to see ProtagonistC in the hospital , unsure how long ProtagonistC had left on this earth . ProtagonistA had only been in a hospital once before at a young age , but when ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA they were filled with lots of people ProtagonistA assumed that 's why ProtagonistA could see more of them . ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC that day , for the first time in ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistC's thin , silvery hair was short and surprisingly well maintained for someone who had been in that bed for weeks . ProtagonistC looked fragile , ProtagonistC's arms far from the strong , energetic ones that had rescued ProtagonistA from mishaps in ProtagonistA's youth . ProtagonistA had no idea why ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistC , but it was ProtagonistA's miracle . Until , soon after returning home that night , we got the call that ProtagonistC had passed away . That 's when ProtagonistA began to put it together . Months later ProtagonistA's theory was confirmed when ProtagonistA witnessed a car accident . Or rather , witnessed the life leaving the accident . The sound of crunching metal to ProtagonistA's right while riding in the car caused ProtagonistA to whip ProtagonistA's head to the source of the sound . ProtagonistD entered ProtagonistA's darkness , bloody and barely leaving . Moments later , ProtagonistD stopped breathing and faded from ProtagonistA's view . < nl > Sighing , ProtagonistA stood and walked toward ProtagonistA's door . ProtagonistA could hear voices downstairs , sure that ProtagonistD had decided to stay . Today was not the day to be reprimanded for rudeness , so ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way into the living room with ProtagonistA's best  welcome to our home  face . The scene ProtagonistA found cause every cell in ProtagonistA's body to freeze . ProtagonistA's breath stopped , ProtagonistA's body refused to move , ProtagonistA was even certain ProtagonistA's heart had decided not to beat . ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistB . ProtagonistI stood , talking into the darkness , while ProtagonistB approached from the direction of the kitchen . For one instant , the magic of seeing ProtagonistB for the first time took over . Its decimation was swift as terror kicked in . The sound of ProtagonistE's footsteps behind ProtagonistA broke ProtagonistA from ProtagonistA's spell . ProtagonistA turned , and saw ProtagonistE clearly for the first time . ProtagonistE's smirk was playful as ProtagonistE whispered in ProtagonistA's ear . < nl >  Thanks a lot , Goodie Two Shoes , if you had n't come out ProtagonistE could have gotten away with staying in ProtagonistE's room too .  ProtagonistE looked at ProtagonistA strangely when ProtagonistA did n't joke back . < nl >  Hey , there they are ! Where 's ProtagonistF ? ProtagonistA 'd just love to see ProtagonistF ..  The words came from the darkness and ProtagonistA's voice refused to work . ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistE , ProtagonistE's disgust clear as ProtagonistE moved slightly to the side , blocking the staircase . < nl >  Playing .  < nl > ProtagonistA cursed ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's stupidity , standing frozen when ProtagonistA could see ProtagonistA's whole family . Running to ProtagonistG's room , ProtagonistA opened the door quickly and saw nothing .  ProtagonistG ?  ProtagonistA said into the void , but ProtagonistA's answer came from the bottom of the stairs . < nl >  ProtagonistF 's in ProtagonistA's room .  ProtagonistA turned to ProtagonistA's room , taking a deep breath as ProtagonistA opened the door . ProtagonistA saw no sign of ProtagonistF , but heard ProtagonistF giggling at the other side of the room . < nl >  ProtagonistA got ta close the door ! ProtagonistH said ProtagonistH can only play with ProtagonistF if ProtagonistH close the door !  Sighing , ProtagonistA whispered calmly for ProtagonistH to stay here with the hamster and locked ProtagonistE's door quietly as ProtagonistA closed it . Downstairs , ProtagonistI was still talking to ProtagonistD . ProtagonistA had known ProtagonistD's voice instantly . ProtagonistI . < nl > ProtagonistA silently cursed ProtagonistA foe never listening to ProtagonistE . For years ProtagonistE had hated ProtagonistI , and when pressed ProtagonistE would just mutter something about  ProtagonistD's 's a creep  . ProtagonistA had never understood what ProtagonistE saw in ProtagonistD that was so awful , when ProtagonistA and the rest of the world just saw a family man . Suddenly ProtagonistI's conversation changed from background noise to the center of ProtagonistA's attention . < nl >  Why do n't ProtagonistA come in , have a beer ? ProtagonistI 'm sure that family of ProtagonistA can spare ProtagonistA for a bit .  ProtagonistI offered with a smile . < nl >  Oh , they 've got all the time in the world .  < eos > 
< sos > Boston . < nl > Here ProtagonistA find ProtagonistA again , strolling down a valley of asphalt , glass , and concrete . ProtagonistA 'd been to so many like it in the last few hundred years , but each one had it 's own unique personality . < nl > ProtagonistA grumble to ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA wander , eyeing every  help wanted  sign ProtagonistA pass . Driven once again by the tiresome necessity of finding a new job like every other time ProtagonistA 'd moved . Ten years is a long time to some , but often not long enough . ProtagonistA had to leave wherever ProtagonistA lived before ProtagonistA got too tied down , before it got dangerous or people started asking too many questions . < nl > Supermarket ? Pshh , not likely . Barber ? If there was one thing ProtagonistA did n't want to do all day , it was touch other people 's heads . The fire company ? Ha ! Way too dangerous , ProtagonistA could still get hurt after all , and what 's the point of long life just to potentially throw it away on a risky job . Bookstore ? Hmmm , always a safe bet , lots to read , nice and quiet ... < nl > Ugh . Maybe ProtagonistA should just pull up an online job board , roll some dice and be done with it . It 's bad enough having to keep getting to know all new people every time . < nl > ProtagonistA glanced around at the people wandering the street . Pondering for a moment what each of them was about today . What were they each trying to make of their short little lives . One very old woman passing by looked up at ProtagonistA with shockingly green eyes . ProtagonistA froze as the spark made its way through ProtagonistA and erupted a powder keg of a memory buried for nearly a century . < nl > * Smoke . Flames . Heat . Oh so much heat ! * < nl > * ProtagonistA crouched low , groggy with sleep , still trying to get ProtagonistA's bearings . * < nl > * When had this fire started ? How ? How did it get so far before waking ProtagonistA up ? ProtagonistA have to get out of here ! ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistA 'm swimming in syrup . The fire is in ProtagonistA's lungs ! No . ProtagonistA ca n't panic . ProtagonistA have to get out of here ! It wo n't end like this ! * < nl > * A cry . There 's a screaming child . No , ProtagonistA ca n't help , ProtagonistA have to get out ! But ... ProtagonistA 'll never stop having nightmares about this if ProtagonistA ignore it . There , in the crib ! Where are the parents ? Oh no , the other room is caved in . ProtagonistA 've got to get us out of here . Wow , ProtagonistA 've never seen eyes so green ... * < nl >  Excuse ProtagonistA ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA just ca n't help but say , ProtagonistA have such lovely vibrant emerald eyes .  < nl >  Oh thank ProtagonistA ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA sure know how to bring a smile to a lady .  < nl >  ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistA do n't mind ProtagonistA saying , ProtagonistA really seem like ProtagonistA 've been around quite a long time , but ProtagonistA have such a lively air about ProtagonistA .  < nl >  Ha ha , funny ProtagonistA should say that , ProtagonistA 've just recently celebrated ProtagonistA's 100'th birthday ! ProtagonistA am so blessed to have been around here for so long .  < nl >  Wow , well it must 've been a great 100 years for ProtagonistA then !  < nl >  ProtagonistA might be surprised . ProtagonistA lost ProtagonistA's family to a fire before ProtagonistA knew them , ProtagonistA only survived by the kindness of a mysterious stranger . ProtagonistA have endured many hardships . War , heartbreak , and loss . But , ProtagonistA never would have gotten to experience any of that if ProtagonistA had perished with ProtagonistA's family . Nor would ProtagonistA have had the chance to cherish all the goodness and love that ProtagonistA now have in ProtagonistA's life . That stranger inspired ProtagonistA to give everything ProtagonistA could to help those with nothing . It 's all been worth it , just to brighten up the lives of those ProtagonistA meet , even if just for a little while .  < nl > ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistA with a smile of deep joy .  Ah well , you youngsters have better things to do than listen to ProtagonistA ramble on about the good ole days . ProtagonistA best keep up ProtagonistA's walk before these old joints freeze up .  < nl > For a moment , ProtagonistA simply stare as ProtagonistA slowly but surely makes ProtagonistA's way past ProtagonistA and down the sidewalk with that friendly smile and still confident step .  Wait up ! Maybe ProtagonistA do n't have anything better to do than listen to some ramblings on a nice stroll about town .  < nl >  Oh , well that would be lovely .  < nl > As we walk , ProtagonistA ca n't help but marvel at the sheer chance of it all . You know , maybe ProtagonistA will try out that fire fighting job . After all , what 's the point of living a long time without giving some of that life to others ? < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA watched , unfazed , as the devil materialized amongst billowing smoke and sizzling flame in ProtagonistA's dining room . Up until this point , ProtagonistA 'd been dining alone , as usual , though ProtagonistA wondered if the spectacle would bring the attention of ProtagonistA's staff , or if - perhaps - this grandiosity was an illusion for ProtagonistA's senses only . < nl > The devil was enormous , and approached ProtagonistA with a clawed appendage outstretched . From somewhere in the depths of ProtagonistA's mind , ProtagonistA could hear the familiar raspy growl that was n't exactly words , but was unmistakable in it 's meaning . < nl > * *  ProtagonistA , I am here for ProtagonistA's soul .  * * < nl > Taking ProtagonistA's time , ProtagonistA wiped ProtagonistA's mouth and set the linen napkin next to ProtagonistA's plate . ProtagonistA rested ProtagonistA's elbows on either side , tented ProtagonistA's fingers , and leveled ProtagonistA's gaze directly at the eyes of the devil .  No you 're not .  < nl > * *  How dare you , mortal . You signed a contract , and our deal is done . You 've achieved your goal , and built your empire . Future generations of your line should want for nothing . Your soul is the price . I am here to collect .  * * < nl >  Sole .  < nl > * *  What ?  * * < nl > With ProtagonistA's own display of magic , ProtagonistA stood and procured an ancient- looking roll of parchment from thin air , and flattened it on the table in front of ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA slipped on ProtagonistA's reading glasses , searching nimbly with ProtagonistA's index finger for the exact line ProtagonistA needed in the contract .  The deal we signed was for ProtagonistA's sole . S - o - l - e , not soul , s - o - u - l .  ProtagonistA pushed forward ProtagonistA's plate of flat fish with a lemon and caper beurre blanc .  You can have this shit .  < nl > For a moment , the devil was so still , its presence seemed to absorb any light on its side of the table . Then its eyes pinched shut as an unmistakable look of pain and frustration overtook its powerful visage . It snatched up the contract , reading it over in a desperate frenzy before letting out a roar that crossed over from the plane of telepathy into actual vocal sounds .  Aaagghhh ! What the heck ! ?  < nl > ProtagonistA smirked . ProtagonistA remembered the feeling of empowerment when ProtagonistA first discovered the contract 's flaw . All these years , ProtagonistA 'd been eagerly awaiting this moment . < nl > Something made the devil pause again . A grin spread across its face , and it once again slipped back into a menacing facade . Ash and embers swirled around the room , daring to smother or spark . * *  ProtagonistA's empire ... was it not built on the bounty of the sea ? I WILL take ProtagonistA's sole . I will take all of it , and leave ProtagonistA with nothing .  * * < nl >  Motherfucker , I sell cod .  < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA hated ProtagonistB so much that even the act of buying magazines to cut up into a death threat filled ProtagonistA with rage .  Who actually buys magazines these days  , ProtagonistA mumbled as ProtagonistA searched for scissors in ProtagonistA's messy junk drawer .  How does ProtagonistB always manage to make ProtagonistA's life harder just by existing ?  ProtagonistA smiled and thought to ProtagonistA that THAT particular problem would come to an end soon enough . ProtagonistA had n't actually thought of what to write yet , so ProtagonistA decided to just cut out multiples of each letter from a  Birds and Blooms  gardening magazine . ProtagonistA only managed to get to  J  when ProtagonistA started noticing ProtagonistA breathing slow- something about this activity was the most soothing thing ProtagonistA had felt in weeks of anger and hatred . At first ProtagonistA thought it was the dioramas of fountains and forget - me -nots , but around the time ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA laughing and cutting out little birds to use for dotting ProtagonistA's eyes , ProtagonistA realized that it was the act of creation that was turning the static hum of ProtagonistA's hatred into excitement and anticipation . The thrill of turning mundane letters into a Warhol - esque collage set off something primal in ProtagonistA , and for the first time in so lomg , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA grounded . < nl > The next day , ProtagonistB checked ProtagonistB's letter box to find a piece of construction paper majestically decorated with birds , flowers , and , directly in the center , a message that read ,  I foRGiVe yoU.   Huh ,  ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB wonder who that 's from ,  and went about ProtagonistB's day . < eos > 
< sos > There was a production to the whole magic business . ProtagonistA , a group around ProtagonistA casting stamina spells and sleeplessness spells , and ProtagonistB keeping track of how long it was taking ProtagonistC to cast the Enigmas Tomingata . < nl > The Enigmas Tomingata was a useless spell , a day and a half long and all it did was an extravagantly clean beard trim . That being said , it was right in the sweet spot for competitive casting . < nl >  Anashalos ,  ProtagonistB yawned , and a wave of wakefulness came over ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB really had n't been thinking when ProtagonistB took this job , ProtagonistB 'd thought about the easy money and how easy it would be to stay in the same spot for 36 hours with a stopwatch in ProtagonistB's hand to see if ProtagonistC could beat ProtagonistC's previous record of 35 hours , 56 minutes and 45 seconds to cast the Enigmas Tomingata . What ProtagonistB had n't considered was how boring watching an old man try to rap nonsense would be . That being said , it was a days job , and it kept ProtagonistB in ProtagonistB's apartment . < nl > The stopwatch clicked over to 35:56:46 and ProtagonistB considered stopping the spell . ProtagonistC was around the end of the incantation , somewhere around Septivus Morani which meant that ProtagonistB could at least let ProtagonistC finish . ProtagonistC needed a trim anyway . < nl > The spell winded down , and the group around ProtagonistC started to buzz . Did they really think they won ? They were off by a full minute this time around . ProtagonistB did n't know what had gone on , but ProtagonistB also did n't care . A missed attempt meant ProtagonistB could go home instead of staying here and signing a thousand sheets of paper . < nl > The time was revealed with a quick sorry and a bow before ProtagonistB ducked out of the auditorium . ProtagonistB had better things to do with ProtagonistB's time then stay around ProtagonistC and hear ProtagonistC try to figure out where ProtagonistC 'd lost a minute . Now that ProtagonistB had rent it meant that ProtagonistB could spend the evening focusing on real magic . < nl > Solo spellcasting was something of a lost art . Sure , old men like ProtagonistC worked their entire lives to make sure that they were the quickest spell weavers on the market , but realistically spells were never made to be done by one man . At least not spells that had any sort of power behind them . < nl > If solo spellcasting was a nuanced practice for a more civilized age , then modern day casting was the rough , rusty cutting edge that the younger generation worked on . You did n't get one person to cast a long spell , keeping them up for several years while they stared at a book , you got a good group of people with silver tongues , and you weaved them together into spell symphonies . < nl > ProtagonistD was at the door when ProtagonistB got home ; ProtagonistD was doing ProtagonistD's best impression of Mom 's ' really ? ' look .  ProtagonistB 're running late ,  ProtagonistD commented . < nl >  ProtagonistC did n't break the record .  < nl >  Did ProtagonistC have a chance ?  ProtagonistD asked as ProtagonistD undid the chain lock . < nl >  ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistC did for a bit ,  ProtagonistB said as ProtagonistB pulled on ProtagonistB's tie to loosen it .  Woulda only been a few minutes either way .  < nl >  ProtagonistB get the drinks ?  ProtagonistD asked as ProtagonistD waved ProtagonistB in . < nl >  Did n't think it was ProtagonistB's turn ,  ProtagonistB answered . Had it been ProtagonistB's turn ? It was ProtagonistD's turn last week which meant that- nah it was n't ProtagonistB . < nl >  Reg could n't make it so ProtagonistD texted ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistD answered ,  whatever we can make some before starting .  < nl >  Sure thing ,  ProtagonistB nodded and slung ProtagonistB's bag off ProtagonistB's shoulder onto the floor . ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistD meant ' ProtagonistD ' was going to make something instead of ' us . ' That was ProtagonistB's job in the group as a lead caster ; ProtagonistB had to carry the spells when people had to take breaks . < nl > Actually , with how it turned out it mostly meant that they were covering for ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB needed a quick breath . < nl > The key with symphony casting was that people did n't just keep one another awake with small spells , we passed the spell from hand to hand rather than making one person say the entire thing . It let you cast faster , move quicker , the only issue was the occasional explosive reaction that happened when you crossed the wrong word , but that was why people called it bleeding edge , right ? < nl >  ProtagonistB gon na do it ?  ProtagonistD asked as ProtagonistD kicked by bag further away from the door . < nl >  Sure thing ,  ProtagonistB sighed and started mumbling under ProtagonistB's breath to get the drinks conjured for practice . It was only gon na take a minute , the spell was n't had , and ProtagonistB was n't about to take requests . < nl > Right around the end of the spell there was another knock at the door and ProtagonistE came in without waiting for us to answer , ProtagonistE 'd started letting ProtagonistE in when ProtagonistD and ProtagonistE had become a thing and had n't stopped once they had . < nl >  That everyone ?  ProtagonistE asked ProtagonistB when ProtagonistB was in the middle of casting . ProtagonistB motioned to ProtagonistB's mouth to show that ProtagonistE was an idiot for asking ProtagonistB and ProtagonistE rolled ProtagonistE's eyes . ProtagonistE walked away , and ProtagonistB started getting jugs out of the cabinets , so ProtagonistB did n't spill all over the counter . < nl >  Merevi ,  ProtagonistB finished , and the jugs all began to fill with fruit punch , it was ProtagonistB's choice because ProtagonistB was casting the damn spell . < nl >  Ready for warmups ?  ProtagonistD called from the other room . That meant all six of us were here . < nl >  Skip ProtagonistB for the first lines ,  ProtagonistB yelled as ProtagonistB tried to get the jugs arranged so ProtagonistB could take them in all at once instead of making more than one trip . < nl > ProtagonistD started the disc with the base for timing , and ProtagonistE started to sing the spell . < nl > As soon as ProtagonistE spoke there was a different energy in the room , magic pulling on our tongues to try to guide us in the way that the spell was going to flow . We stopped being a group of friends and started being a group of advanturers on the white waters of casting . ProtagonistB took a deep breath to avoid speaking and breakin the spell as ProtagonistB brought drinks into the room . < nl > ProtagonistE glared at ProtagonistB as ProtagonistB came into the room as if to say ' about time ' instead of the incantation . ProtagonistE started half a word  Plyis-  < nl >  sirasi ,  ProtagonistB finished for ProtagonistE and ProtagonistB stole the reins of magic from ProtagonistE , tearing the paddle from ProtagonistE's hands and adding ProtagonistB's energy to our effort to fight the flow of the river . < nl > * * to those interested ProtagonistB will be making a part 2 tomorrow on /r / Jacksonwrites based on /u / supremecrafters idea of ' awesome spells done quick . * * < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA kept ProtagonistA's head down , walking through the city to ProtagonistA's subway . ProtagonistA's headphones were in , but silent . ProtagonistA's glasses were dark , even though it was a cloudy day . Anything to avoid people . < nl > It was n't that ProtagonistA did n't like people . In fact , ProtagonistA was envious of almost every human interaction ProtagonistA saw . Out of the corner of ProtagonistA's eye , sitting on the train , a couple of teenagers laughed - carefree . ProtagonistB was having a very animated conversation with a friend across from ProtagonistB . Obviously new lovers fawned over each other at the back . That was what ProtagonistA envied most - love . At any stage . ProtagonistA especially would love to even suffer through a divorce . < nl > Instead , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was cursed . ProtagonistA's shrink thought ProtagonistA was making this up , that it was just a series of coincidences that fueled ProtagonistA's obsessive - compulsive traits . However , ProtagonistA knew better . < nl > Suddenly , ProtagonistC sat beside ProtagonistA jostling into ProtagonistA's backpack .  Sorry ,  ProtagonistC said sheepishly ,  ProtagonistC am not used to the ramble of the train .  ProtagonistA protectively brought ProtagonistA's backpack up onto ProtagonistA's lap and turned slightly away .    ProtagonistC 'm new to the city ,  ProtagonistC persisted , ignoring ProtagonistA's headphones . Perhaps ProtagonistC could n't see them ?  How long have ProtagonistC been here ?  . Idle chit - chat . If only ProtagonistA could risk speaking to ProtagonistC . It was ProtagonistA's stop ; ProtagonistA was saved from this tempting torture . < nl > ProtagonistA bustled out of the train , pulling ProtagonistA's backpack on and walking briskly through the station . ProtagonistA bounded up the stairs in twos , enjoying the blast of the cool fall air on ProtagonistA's face when ProtagonistA emerged . ProtagonistA walked the last block to ProtagonistA's job , the most suitable job for ProtagonistA - record keeping at the city hall . ProtagonistA worked in the basement , mostly alone except for ProtagonistD . Now ProtagonistA was in charge and left alone . ProtagonistA doubted if anybody even remembers ProtagonistA was there , to be honest . < nl > Just as ProtagonistA settled into ProtagonistA's office , ProtagonistC flashed into the room smiling . < nl >  Oh hey ! From the train !  ProtagonistC stated . ProtagonistC's grin was charming and fearless . < nl >  I , ugh , can I help ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistA blurted . ProtagonistA almost had forgotten what ProtagonistA's voice sounded like . Melodic , sweet , unworn by lack of use . < nl >  ProtagonistC's apologies , ProtagonistC 'm Tim - the new assistant record keeper . Apparently , a woman retired so ProtagonistC was lucky enough to nail this job . ProtagonistC moved here from New Jersey just last week ; wow has it been a whirlwind , packing , finding a place , unpacking ... Oh , ProtagonistC 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistC paused , noticing ProtagonistA's obvious bewilderment ,  ProtagonistC tend to ramble !  < nl > Great . ProtagonistC , and a rambler . A handsome man at that ...  Okay ... ProtagonistC ... ProtagonistA 'm Hope ,  ProtagonistA flushed ,  well , ProtagonistA suppose let 's get ProtagonistC trained .  They stood staring at each other . ProtagonistC started to ramble again , about ProtagonistC's family in New Jersey . ' This is going to be a long couple of weeks ... ' ProtagonistA thought , secretly praying there was something ProtagonistA would n't like about ProtagonistC . < nl > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ < nl > I just ca n't understand ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was a beautiful , smart , and secretly witty woman who would suddenly shy away from any interaction with me . There was some sort of invisible line that I ca n't see , and when I cross it , ProtagonistA retreats into that head of ProtagonistA with incredible speed . One minute ProtagonistA's eyes would twinkle , the next , ProtagonistA may as well be wearing those dark sunglasses ProtagonistA seemed to wear like a child 's safety blanket . < nl > Despite ProtagonistA's retreats , I have to admit - I am infatuated . I decided to win ProtagonistA's trust , no matter the cost . < nl > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ < nl > ProtagonistA cried when ProtagonistC left ProtagonistA flowers in ProtagonistA's office . ProtagonistA cried like ProtagonistA had n't cried in years . ProtagonistA read ProtagonistC's note over and over and cried . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistC 'd be in soon , even though it was Saturday , because of ProtagonistC's note : < nl >  ProtagonistA - ProtagonistC can not get ProtagonistA out of ProtagonistC's mind . When ProtagonistA's eyes twinkle , ProtagonistC's stomach flutters with joy . ProtagonistC want to spend every day , for as long as ProtagonistA let ProtagonistC , trying to make ProtagonistA smile . ProtagonistC know ProtagonistA planned on catching up today , but instead , ProtagonistC 'll be by in the morning to finally do some touristy things ProtagonistA keep recommending . < nl > ProtagonistA 're special , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistC  < nl > ProtagonistA looked at the clock . It had been an hour of crying , and ProtagonistA had n't made a plan . An escape plan . How to get out of this ? Do ProtagonistA flat out refuse ? Tell ProtagonistC ProtagonistA 'm a lesbian ? ? Okay , now ProtagonistA was just grasping at straws . Perhaps ProtagonistA would leave and pretend ProtagonistA had changed ProtagonistA's mind ? Yes ! That 's what ... just then , the door opened . < nl >  ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistC said quietly , entering the office ,  Did ProtagonistC's note ... upset ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistC could tell that ProtagonistA was crying . ProtagonistA 'm sure anybody with a set of eyes could tell ProtagonistA was crying . < nl >  ProtagonistA ... ProtagonistA ...  ProtagonistA stuttered . < nl >  It 's okay ,  ProtagonistC looked at ProtagonistC's shoes ,  ProtagonistC 'll go .  Not knowing what to say , ProtagonistA's heart swelling with emotions , ProtagonistA let ProtagonistC leave in silence . < nl > ProtagonistA slumped into the chair , prepared for another round of horrible sobs to wrack over ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA reached for the note , just to torture ProtagonistA again when a loud thump came from the basement door . < nl >  ProtagonistC ?  ProtagonistA said quietly into the silence , not knowing why ProtagonistA thought that was ProtagonistC . A horrible thought came over ProtagonistA . A very dark , horrible thought that caused panic to rise up in ProtagonistA's throat . < nl >  ProtagonistC ! ?  ProtagonistA flew to the door , logically knowing ProtagonistA was being ridiculous , but ProtagonistA's fear could n't be controlled . ProtagonistA whipped open the door , and suddenly it was all very real . < nl > Slumped against the door , ProtagonistC was bent at an unusual angle . ProtagonistC 'd fallen down the cement stairs . ProtagonistC was n't moving . ProtagonistA held a shaky hand by ProtagonistC's face to feel ProtagonistC's breath and found none . ProtagonistA fell on top of ProtagonistC , bile rising to ProtagonistA's throat , not again ! < nl >  ProtagonistC ...  ProtagonistA choked out . How can this be ? ProtagonistA did n't love ProtagonistC ... wait , the flowers . The card . The tears , and then ... when ProtagonistC left after seeing ProtagonistA was upset . ProtagonistA had fallen in love , of course ProtagonistA had . ProtagonistA was starved for any interaction , any kindness , and when ProtagonistC walked away ProtagonistC had done what others would n't . ProtagonistC showed ProtagonistA that ProtagonistC cared for ProtagonistA more than ProtagonistC cared about ProtagonistC's ego or ProtagonistC's feelings , and done what ProtagonistA had needed ProtagonistC to do . < nl >  Hope ?  ProtagonistA's heart stopped . ProtagonistA swear it stopped right then . Did ProtagonistC just .. ?  Hope ?  ProtagonistC said again . Suddenly ProtagonistC was straightening up , bones were cracking , and ProtagonistC was standing . < nl >  ProtagonistC !  ProtagonistA screeched , it echoed through the stairwell . < nl >  ProtagonistA , do n't be frightened , please ...  ProtagonistC looked shameful , embarrassed even . < nl >  What the fuck ? !  ProtagonistA shouted , confused and shaken .  ProtagonistC were DEAD !  < nl > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ < nl > ProtagonistA looked into those terrified eyes , and it was like looking into a mirror . ProtagonistA had been careful to avoid anything dangerous all of ProtagonistA's life . ProtagonistA took public transport instead of driving a car . ProtagonistA accepted a job in a records office , the most mundane safe thing ProtagonistA could think of . ProtagonistA rarely left ProtagonistA's apartment , and ProtagonistA made sure that it was on the ground floor . The only thing ProtagonistA could n't avoid were these damn stairs , and now ProtagonistA knew . < nl >  Hope ProtagonistA can explain ...  ProtagonistA started , but honestly , ProtagonistA had no idea how to explain this . When ProtagonistA was a boy , ProtagonistA had fallen into a neighbours pool when nobody was around . ProtagonistA could n't swim , and ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA was a goner . ProtagonistA had sunk to the bottom when ProtagonistA could no longer keep ProtagonistA's head above water . It burned as ProtagonistA took what ProtagonistA believed was ProtagonistA's final breaths , but then the escape of death did n't come . ProtagonistA have no idea how long ProtagonistA waited to die until ProtagonistA simply got bored , as children do , and brought ProtagonistA to safety . < nl > For years , ProtagonistA thought it was either a miracle or something ProtagonistA had dreamed up . That was until the car accident in high school . ProtagonistA's best friend and his girlfriend were killed instantly , but ProtagonistA was left unscathed . ProtagonistA had felt every single bone break , even the puncture to ProtagonistA's lung , and watched the blood pool around ProtagonistA . By the time the ambulance arrived , ProtagonistA did n't have a mark on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was immortal . < nl > ProtagonistA suddenly clutched ProtagonistA , and whispered ProtagonistA's story into ProtagonistA's ear as ProtagonistA sobbed quietly into ProtagonistA's chest . < nl > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ < nl > ProtagonistC was still hugging ProtagonistA . ProtagonistC had finished what seemed like ages ago , and it seemed impossible to process what ProtagonistC was saying . So instead , ProtagonistA shared ProtagonistA's story .  Every man ProtagonistA 've ever loved has died .  ProtagonistA started . Despite the fact that ProtagonistC had just claimed immortality , years of therapy had ProtagonistA feeling foolish about this statement . It was a coincidence , bad luck , it was not real . This was not real . < nl >  ProtagonistE died in a car accident driving home after the first time we made love .  ProtagonistA sputtered . < nl >  Then , years after ProtagonistE's death , ProtagonistA fell in love in college . It was a whirlwind relationship , young love . Within two weeks , ProtagonistE fell off a balcony at a party .  ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistA's hands , feeling guilty . That 's when ProtagonistA started to have the thoughts that it was ProtagonistA's fault . That ProtagonistA had somehow controlled these events , even when ProtagonistA was n't there . After years of therapy and medication , ProtagonistA finally had the courage to date and ProtagonistA met ProtagonistF . No , ProtagonistA's last victim . < nl > ProtagonistA was so careful with ProtagonistF . ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's time , keeping ProtagonistF at a distance for as long as ProtagonistA could . It lasted almost a year until ProtagonistF surprised ProtagonistA at ProtagonistA's family 's lake house , with a ring . ProtagonistF died that night in ProtagonistF's sleep , right next to ProtagonistA . That was almost a decade ago now , but ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistF's face every night in ProtagonistA's dreams . Cold and lifeless . < nl > As ProtagonistA finished ProtagonistA's story , the silence surrounding ProtagonistA was deafening . ProtagonistA's head swirled with emotions and confusion . All of ProtagonistA's beliefs were suddenly validated . It was n't just a coincidence , it was real . ProtagonistC fell down these stairs and died too , just because ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistC ... but ProtagonistC was n't dead . ProtagonistC was immortal and standing before ProtagonistA despite ProtagonistA's flaws . Despite ProtagonistA's curse that had taken three others . < nl >  Hope ,  ProtagonistC broke the silence . ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC smiled ,  Do ProtagonistA believe in soul mates ?  < eos > 
< sos >  What happens after ProtagonistA finish watching them all ?  asked ProtagonistA . < nl >  Well ,  came ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA could n't see ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistB sounded like Ms Perrine at school , who always had time and a kind word for them .  There 's no rush , really . ProtagonistA can stay here as long as ProtagonistA like , watching them over and over again . When ProtagonistA 're done , like , * really done * , ProtagonistA can let ProtagonistB know .  < nl >  And then ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA may then pass on ,  said ProtagonistB .  Your body on earth ... expires .  < nl >  Oh ,  said ProtagonistA .  What 's there after that ?  < nl >  Nothing ,  said ProtagonistB . < nl > The ten crystalline balls ( ProtagonistA made sure to count them ) hovered in the air , floating in that dark , inky room . ProtagonistA was reminded of the conservatory ProtagonistA had visited during ProtagonistA's school 's science camp , where ProtagonistA's class had been ushered into a similarly - darkened auditorium . Stars , planets , constellations had flooded the ceiling of the auditorium , one after the other , sparkling and glittering like so many diamonds out of reach . < nl >  That 's number 4 ,  said ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA 're thinking of number 4 . Timothy even grabbed ProtagonistA's hand during the lightshow , and did n't let go until just before the lights came back on .  < nl > Right on cue , the fourth crystal from the left shimmered an azure blue , begging for ProtagonistA to reach out and touch it .  Oh no , ProtagonistA can see that too !  said ProtagonistA , laughing as ProtagonistA covered ProtagonistA's cheeks which had gone aflame . < nl >  There are nine others like that one ,  said ProtagonistB ,  the top ten important moments in your life . Pick and choose , take ProtagonistA's time . Only when you 're ready need you move on .  < nl > ProtagonistA reached out instinctively , the excitement bubbling up in ProtagonistA . This was better than any vlog or video ProtagonistA could ever hope to compose on ProtagonistA's own . Previews of ProtagonistA's memories , perfectly captured and rendered , played out under ProtagonistA's fingertips . ProtagonistA realised how lucky ProtagonistA was as each of the crystals yielded their secrets to ProtagonistA , for they invariably contained happy , cheerful memories . ProtagonistA cycled through the first few , loathe to move on , immersing ProtagonistA over and over in that endless bliss of a charmed life . < nl > Then , a thought occurred to ProtagonistA . < nl >  ProtagonistA ... ProtagonistA do n't remember dying ,  ProtagonistA said , brows furrowed .  It 's hazy , for some reason .  < nl >  ProtagonistA 're technically still alive ,  said ProtagonistB .  But if ProtagonistA 're curious , events leading up to it will be in the last crystal . It always counts as the last significant event , for obvious reasons .  < nl >  Will ... ProtagonistA be sad if ProtagonistA watch it ?  asked ProtagonistA . < nl >  It depends ,  said ProtagonistB .  Do n't forget , there 's always the other nine to cheer ProtagonistA right back up .  < nl > ProtagonistA hesitated , torn between the first nine crystals and the last one . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's mind was playing tricks on ProtagonistA , because where the ten of them were indistinguishable before , now the last one seemed ominous , forbidden . ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA's fingers trembling just reaching out to that last crystal , and then that impulse again to lose ProtagonistA in the first nine , to leave that door unopened . < nl > After all , the rest really were all that ProtagonistA needed - one was the day that ProtagonistA's family adopted ProtagonistC . Another was the day that ProtagonistA's parents brought ProtagonistD home from the hospital , ProtagonistD . So many memories , so many * good * memories , all within reach , all begging for endless consumption . < nl > Never be afraid to make the tough choice , ProtagonistA's dad 's motto sounded in ProtagonistA's head . < nl > ProtagonistA sighed , then reached out for the last crystal . It unfolded when ProtagonistA touched it , the way a touch - me - not would , but in reverse , and light spilled out , bathing the room in an orangey glow . Shapes and sounds and feelings and thoughts coalesced around ProtagonistA , and for a moment it felt like ProtagonistA was back in the moment , reliving that very memory . ProtagonistA recognised the scene immediately . < nl >  Such a beautiful drive ,  said ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA were playing all the way with ProtagonistD , were ProtagonistA not ?  < nl >  Yes ,  said ProtagonistA .  Six hours to Disneyland , Dad said . The hours flew by though . We talked about school , ProtagonistD told ProtagonistA about the boy ProtagonistD had a crush on , we napped , we snacked , we counted the number of cars which passed us ...  < nl > Then , the memory cut off , dousing the room back in an oily gloom . It looped again soon after , right back where it first started , as if it had never stopped in the first place . < nl >  That 's all ProtagonistA remember of it ?  asked ProtagonistA . < nl >  That 's all ProtagonistA witnessed ,  offered ProtagonistB . < nl >  Can ProtagonistB tell ProtagonistA ... what happened after that ?  < nl > A short silence , and for a moment ProtagonistA wondered if ProtagonistB had gone away . ProtagonistB returned just as ProtagonistA thought to ask the question again . < nl >  There are n't any rules about this ,  said ProtagonistB ,  and ProtagonistB do n't suppose there 's any harm in it . There was an accident , ProtagonistA . Someone else had fallen asleep at the wheel , drifted into ProtagonistA's lane .  < nl >  That 's not good ,  said ProtagonistA .  Are ... they ok ? Mum , Dad ? ProtagonistD ?  < nl >  They 're fine . All of them . In fact , they 're right there beside ProtagonistA now , watching and waiting for ProtagonistA to recover . There are machines hooked up to ProtagonistA , keeping ProtagonistA alive ... but just barely .  < nl > ProtagonistA looked back at the other crystals , and then it occurred to ProtagonistA why they seemed so familiar .  Time moves differently here , does n't it ,  ProtagonistA said , flitting through the other memories .  How long have ProtagonistA been here , looking through these ?  < nl >  Not that long ,  said ProtagonistB . < nl >  How long ?  < nl >  About a year ?  < nl > ProtagonistA smiled , then released the crystal ProtagonistA had been holding in ProtagonistA's hand . It rose slowly , floating up to join the others , until they were arranged neatly in a row again . ProtagonistA could n't deny that it was nice being here , looking back at the memories , reliving them , savouring them . < nl > Knowing that ProtagonistA's family was out there waiting for ProtagonistA to return though , took some of that shine away . ProtagonistA did n't like to keep anyone waiting . < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm ready .  < nl >  ProtagonistA sure ?  asked ProtagonistB . < nl >  Yes ,  ProtagonistA said . < nl > --- < nl > /r / rarelyfunny < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistB had asked several times to go home , but ProtagonistA said that ProtagonistA no longer remembered where Earth was located . ProtagonistA had gotten the coordinates from a trading partner , and after they had abducted ProtagonistB ProtagonistA had overwritten that file with a note to the cleaning crew . * Make sure ProtagonistB gets watered . * < nl > That had been an unpleasant and terrifying awakening , but soon the crew knew the basics of human care . ProtagonistB was just lucky that ProtagonistA came from an oxygen based planet and ProtagonistB had n't died . They told ProtagonistB's stories of other ships filled with water or different gasses , some of the stranger aliens looking forlorn at the tanks on their heads . < nl > They started out giving ProtagonistB small tasks , but soon ProtagonistB graduated to some of the most important jobs on the ship . Most of the crew needed 2 to 3 times the sleep ProtagonistB did , so ProtagonistB often ended up running the engine room by ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB had n't known anything about engines before , but the one in this ship was so simple and optimized that it was n't difficult to learn . This astounded ProtagonistB's crewmates , as they all had the equivalent of a bachelor 's degree to understand it . < nl > The artificial gravity on the spacecraft was extremely light . While others walked or slithered normally , ProtagonistB could cover a room in a single bound . ProtagonistB thought this was actually very fun and , since ProtagonistB was much smaller than the rest of the crew , was asked to do many repairs in high or hard to reach places . ProtagonistB really did n't mind . < nl > ProtagonistB soon became ProtagonistA's favorite , though ProtagonistA treated ProtagonistB more as a pet than a person . ProtagonistA found a planet that grew cocoa beans and would regularly buy chocolate just for ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB made sure to handle these boxes ProtagonistB , as the chocolate was toxic to the rest of the crew . < nl > As for the crew themselves , they treated ProtagonistB with cautious respect . They would joke around with ProtagonistB but would avoid upsetting ProtagonistB at all costs . It may have had something to do with ProtagonistB accidentally shattering a ceramic plate once . ProtagonistB felt like ProtagonistB was always stopping them from doing stupid things , such as grabbing live wires and making sure they wore their protective suits when doing outside repairs . ProtagonistB felt like a mom sometimes . < nl > That 's why when they passed a little planet in a tiny galaxy that looked quite familiar , ProtagonistB chose to say nothing . ProtagonistB was already home . < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistB expected it to be beautiful . < nl > Rolling meadows , fields of wild flowers , the wild scent of fresh lavender and cedar . < nl >  ProtagonistA love you ,  ProtagonistA would proclaim . < nl >  ProtagonistB's beauty burns , ProtagonistB's eyes torture , ProtagonistB's body torments ProtagonistA .  < nl > Blah , blah , blah . < nl > ProtagonistB 'd found ProtagonistA riveting at one point , a young woman drifting through life rather aimlessly , unable to discern a true purpose , but instead filled with an indelible lack of purpose . < nl > Jazz clubs , disco clubs , dance clubs , they all were the same to ProtagonistB now . < nl > A different part of ProtagonistB remembers the draw , the pull towards intoxicants and their inevitable fallout , that heartless love born of mindless lust . < nl > There ProtagonistB met ProtagonistA . < nl > 50s , 60s , 70s , 80s , 90s , the years blew ProtagonistB by . < nl > How ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA claimed .   How ProtagonistA needed ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA would croon . < nl > Lust .   A woman can live a few lifetimes and still be a fool . < nl > ProtagonistB still remembered , a smoke filled bar shortly after the Japs surrendered , a young man in a tan suit reclining at a restricted table , laughing wildly and drinking liberally as women seemed to fawn over ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistB had found ProtagonistA rather dull .   Repulsive , in fact . < nl > Unfortunately , that provoked ProtagonistA into paying attention to ProtagonistB . < nl > First mistake . < nl > Around building corners , at parties , at the fucking grocery store ProtagonistA would appear , always charming and handsome , but somewhat wrong .   Always off . < nl > ProtagonistB ignored ProtagonistB's instinct and decided to give ProtagonistA a chance . < nl > Second mistake . < nl > ProtagonistA would sing to ProtagonistB , play music to ProtagonistB , recite poems and laud ProtagonistB with praise .   A pedestal ProtagonistA placed ProtagonistB upon , which at first seemed delightful .   Until ProtagonistA's narcissism kicked in . < nl > Do n't go here , do n't talk to them , stay inside , do what ProtagonistA say . < nl > So ProtagonistB refuses . < nl > Then POOF , here comes ProtagonistC . < nl > And old Gods carry magic . < nl > ProtagonistB would scorn ProtagonistA , ignore ProtagonistA , beg ProtagonistA to leave ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA would not .   ProtagonistA simply adored ProtagonistB more . < nl > Then the third strike . < nl > ProtagonistA gave ProtagonistB a terminal disease . < nl > ProtagonistA needed ProtagonistB to be in ProtagonistA's grasp forever , to always be at ProtagonistA's beck and call , to satisfy ProtagonistA whenever ProtagonistA so chose . < nl > Total bullshit .   A curse . < nl > ProtagonistB died in a rather unenthusiastic manner , a car T - boned ProtagonistB's ass rather well .   Instantaneous death .   No pain . < nl > ProtagonistB awoke in a tomb , or what seemed to be a tomb .   The air held heavy , tasting of copper and cedar , a thick orange smoke pervading the space . < nl > Unable to reason , ProtagonistB crawled forward .   ProtagonistB did not know why , but simply complied .   The unwillingness of the dead . < nl > ProtagonistB arose , confused and scared , in what appeared to be a metropolis from a different time . < nl > All full of women . < nl > ProtagonistB moved forward , confounded by what ProtagonistB saw , a thousand languages and a million women , all bartering and fighting and scrapping . < nl > ProtagonistD stopped and stared . < nl >  New here ?  ProtagonistD asked , carrying a bundle of something . < nl > A nod in response . < nl >  What a shame .  < nl > Shocked silence . < nl >  Shall ProtagonistD show ProtagonistD around ?  < nl > A dull nod . < nl >  Come with ProtagonistD , ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistD can tell ProtagonistB how to avoid ProtagonistA .  < nl > ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- < nl > Wander . < nl > Thin streets , wide streets .   Those that smell of roses and thyme , and those that smell of shit and disease . < nl > ProtagonistB is scared and alone here .   Dead or undying , ProtagonistB can not discern .   Rather , there is only a sense of dread .   ProtagonistB .   In a world of mist and blackness , a great hall of missing corpses . < nl > Ahead of ProtagonistB , ProtagonistE leads .   By hand and wrist ProtagonistE pulls and drags , revealing newer and wider plazas and passages .   Somehow , ProtagonistE's age is stripped by ProtagonistE's movements , every patch of time showing a younger and freer version of ProtagonistE .   ProtagonistE was someone else , long ago .   Someone dead and gone . < nl > ProtagonistB finds ProtagonistB following a long dead woman , into a passage of columns .   Some drip with blood , other with milk and honey .   Either way , ProtagonistB knows not to touch the massive pillars of limestone . < nl > Others are meant to lick the sweet and metallic taste of blood . < nl > ProtagonistB finds ProtagonistB descending , not through stairs but a ramp , flanked by walls of a strange earthy substance .   There is not a method of surveillance of any human kind , but the strange eyes of the Gods bore through ProtagonistB's nape . < nl > Ambrosia , mead , wine , beer , meat , jerky all blend together , pouring through ProtagonistB's nostrils .   Those who wander the land of the dead are either damned or blessed .   Yet here ProtagonistB wafts , being neither . < nl > ProtagonistB places a hand against ProtagonistB's cheek , a thin smile cresting over sharpened teeth . < nl >  Those of our beauty must take extraordinary measures .  < nl > ProtagonistB reaches below , placing a crown of tangled statuesque snakes upon ProtagonistB's head . < nl >  ProtagonistB served ProtagonistB's time , as Helen of Troy .  < nl > The crown begins to writhe , alive in its own right . < nl >  To hide from ProtagonistA's advances , we rely on the power of other Gods .  < nl > Wildness through ProtagonistB's hair , snakes through ProtagonistB's scalp twist among the hairs there .   A monster is ProtagonistB's reduction .   ProtagonistB recalls the fables and myths , but can not reconcile the reality .   Death is eternal .   Is ProtagonistB to be a monster for eternity ? < nl > Gods of every faith and denomination can not breach ProtagonistB's power , however . < nl > But ProtagonistB finds ProtagonistB , clutching ProtagonistB's knees and weeping .   ProtagonistB misses ProtagonistB's mother and clouds .   ProtagonistB misses ProtagonistB's father and brother , ProtagonistB's sisters and ProtagonistB's friends .   ProtagonistB does not want to be dead , ProtagonistB wants to fight ProtagonistA . < nl > Now ProtagonistB can only feel hate and rage , clasping fingertips , almost sensing throats below them , satisfied by the life lost beneath them . < nl > ProtagonistB has dissipated into a smoke , but what remains is a being consumed in hate .   ProtagonistB did not ask for an Old God , nor did ProtagonistB offer any sacrifice . < nl > The snakes wriggle within ProtagonistB's hair , and it makes ProtagonistB happy .   Others will submit to this newfound power . < nl > ProtagonistB feels an unremarkable call to the lost metropolis .   To fight ProtagonistA , to regain ProtagonistB's freedom .   To have a life of ProtagonistB's own , to find ProtagonistB's family and apologize for ProtagonistB's sins .   ProtagonistB wanted the best for them , but the lust of a Dead God forced ProtagonistB into this state . < nl > Medusa is a weakling , Athena is a cunt . < nl > ProtagonistB is vengeance incarnate , blessed with the power of the unwilling dead . < nl > ProtagonistB will go home . < nl > ProtagonistB's captor will suffer . < nl > -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- < nl > r / storiesfromapotato < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistB was a matryoshka painter .   At sunset , ProtagonistA would knock on the apartment door with ProtagonistA's wheelbarrow beside ProtagonistA .   ProtagonistA would give ProtagonistB all the plain figurines that ProtagonistA had carved that day , curving the balsam wood into the prospect of a head , shoulders and torso , then cutting ProtagonistC at ProtagonistC's waist so that ProtagonistC's legs would twist off , and hide ProtagonistC's secrets .   ProtagonistB would pay ProtagonistA five hundred rubles for each full matryoshka and then ProtagonistB would go to ProtagonistB's workshop ( which was in fact only just the corner of ProtagonistB's father 's kitchen behind the stove ) and ProtagonistB would paint the wood into ProtagonistD . < nl > ProtagonistB would paint ProtagonistD with long eyelashes and blushing cheeks , and ProtagonistB would wonder what it would feel like to blush and flutter ProtagonistB's own eyes , if ever a kind and handsome man were to pour vodka into a glass , and hand it to ProtagonistB , letting his fingertips pass over ProtagonistB .   ProtagonistB would paint ProtagonistD wearing elegant dresses adorned with tulips and roses , and ProtagonistB would imagine sewing an elegant silk dress to wear ProtagonistB .   ProtagonistB would give the woman full - hearted smiles , and ProtagonistB would try to remember the last time ProtagonistB had smiled , apart from when ProtagonistB meant to attract the customers to ProtagonistB's booth at the Udelnaya .   And then ProtagonistB would paint the next doll nested within , more intricately , but otherwise the same .   However , at ProtagonistD's core , ProtagonistD contained a protest : open ProtagonistD up to ProtagonistE , and you will find that ProtagonistE is not smiling or blushing , but instead has short eyelashes and a stern gaze . ProtagonistE wears only a plain grey dress .   For though ProtagonistB painted matryoshka , ProtagonistB had never known ProtagonistH , and therefore knew that not all daughters will inherit . < nl > In the morning , ProtagonistB would pack ProtagonistD in a box and take the bus to the Udelnaya , hoping to sell ProtagonistB's work .   Most days , ProtagonistB would be lucky to sell two or three matryoshka .   But there was one day when ProtagonistB sold none at all , yet left the Udelnaya joyful . On that day , ProtagonistF had come to the market .   There , ProtagonistF saw ProtagonistB at ProtagonistB's booth with the shelves of matryoshka behind ProtagonistB , all red and green , gold and blue , and ProtagonistF was enamored . < nl >  ProtagonistF have never seen a woman who ProtagonistF am more certain has a secret hiding inside her ,  ProtagonistF said to ProtagonistB .   ProtagonistF was wearing a gold watch and many silver rings .   ProtagonistB told ProtagonistF that ProtagonistF could buy as many matryoshka as ProtagonistF wished , and discover everything within them .   But then ProtagonistF said ProtagonistE was not any of ProtagonistD , but ProtagonistB . < nl > ProtagonistF gave ProtagonistB a piece of paper with directions to an elegant restaurant on the banks of the Moyka River . ProtagonistF ProtagonistF gave ProtagonistB ProtagonistF's credit card as well .   ProtagonistF told ProtagonistB that were ProtagonistB to go buy a nice dress , that ProtagonistF would be honored to see ProtagonistB in it , and dine with ProtagonistB that evening .   ProtagonistB blushed , and then ProtagonistB smiled , even though ProtagonistB had not sold a matryoshka . < nl > That evening , instead of painting , ProtagonistB went to the best boutique in St Petersburg , and ProtagonistB bought a beautiful silk dress .   ProtagonistB then met ProtagonistF at the appointed restaurant .   ProtagonistF spread caviar onto crackers for ProtagonistB , and poured ProtagonistB some vodka .   ProtagonistF asked ProtagonistB about ProtagonistB's life , how many matryoshka ProtagonistB supposed ProtagonistB had painted , and if any were very special to ProtagonistB .   But , as the meal continued , ProtagonistB began to feel more and more confused and dizzy , until everything became terribly blurry .   When ProtagonistB awoke , ProtagonistB was no longer in the restaurant or in the small bed beside ProtagonistB's father 's .   ProtagonistB was standing upright , but frozen in pose , perched on a gold podium in a white expanse , more still and desolate than the Tauride Gardens after the first snowfall .   ProtagonistB was lined up neatly between a hundred other young women , all immobile as well . < nl >  Where am ProtagonistB  ProtagonistB asked ,  who are you all ?  < nl >  ProtagonistF ,  the young woman beside ProtagonistB explained ,  was not in truth a man , but ProtagonistG .   ProtagonistG keeps us here as figurines , upon ProtagonistG's shelf for all eternity .   ProtagonistG tells us that long ago , ProtagonistG once loved a goddess called Anna , who also had no mother , who was the First Woman , and that we remind ProtagonistG of ProtagonistH .   When ProtagonistH birthed their child , the girl was mortal .   So ProtagonistG sought to kill the child as an abomination .   But ProtagonistH loved the baby , so ProtagonistH fled the heavens to the Barsky taiga .   ProtagonistG chased ProtagonistH all through the trees , but ProtagonistH refused to return , and at last a bargain was struck : ProtagonistH would remain in the Barsky with ProtagonistH's daughter , but thereafter ProtagonistH would become mortal as well .   But , if any of ProtagonistH's descendants to ever live without a mother , ProtagonistG would be entitled to reclaim ProtagonistD and bring ProtagonistD here , to remain forever in ProtagonistG's collection .  < nl > ProtagonistB was crestfallen at the thought of never again seeing ProtagonistB's father or St Petersburg , and of being frozen in place .   ProtagonistB screamed out to ProtagonistG and demanded to be freed .   But ProtagonistG just laughed , all throughout ProtagonistG's menagerie . < nl > But then , after many days of considering ProtagonistB's plight , ProtagonistB formed a plan .    Allow ProtagonistB to turn ProtagonistG's collection into matryoshka ! ,  ProtagonistB called out to ProtagonistG ,  Let ProtagonistB separate each of ProtagonistD into pieces , into clear layers , so that ProtagonistG might consider each part of ProtagonistD more easily , and find what it is in each of ProtagonistD that resembles ProtagonistH !  < nl > ProtagonistB's proposal thrilled ProtagonistG , for even after all ProtagonistG's abductions , ProtagonistG was still no closer to grasping what it was that makes a motherless woman so special , so like the First Woman .   ProtagonistG released ProtagonistB's muscles and demanded that ProtagonistB go to work at once , separating and straining each of ProtagonistD into a partwise matryoshka . < nl > From where ProtagonistG watched , it appeared to ProtagonistG ProtagonistB was doing as ProtagonistB had promised .   But each time ProtagonistG's back was turned , or when ProtagonistB carefully angled ProtagonistB's subject and stood nose to nose , ProtagonistB would reach inside ProtagonistI , and ProtagonistB would pull forth ProtagonistI's soul , which lives in ProtagonistI's deepest layer .   ProtagonistB would hide the soul in ProtagonistB's bosom until ProtagonistB could move on and quietly feed it to another girl , until ProtagonistJ had taken in the soul of one of ProtagonistJ's fellow captives .   Finally , ProtagonistB pulled out ProtagonistB's own soul and fed it to the woman whom ProtagonistB had been first placed beside .   At last , each captive woman had taken in the soul of another , thereby promising to care for it and nurture it .   Because of this , the women of the menagerie had all become mothers to each other , and were no longer in thrall to ProtagonistG . < nl > ProtagonistG saw that ProtagonistB was no longer hard at work , so ProtagonistG returned to inspect ProtagonistB's progress .   But as ProtagonistG entered the menagerie , all the captives suddenly broke from their poses .   All together , they hit and kicked ProtagonistG , until ProtagonistG fled .   The menagerie with all its gold podiums vanished , and ProtagonistD fell through a void , until everything again became blurry . ProtagonistB awoke in ProtagonistB's small bed in ProtagonistB's father 's apartment in St Petersburg . < nl > That night , ProtagonistA came at sunset with the blank wood for ProtagonistB .   For the first time , ProtagonistB did not paint the final doll with a stern face and grey dress .   For now , ProtagonistB knew that somewhere there was a woman who would always carry ProtagonistB's soul , always nurture and protect it , and that this meant ProtagonistB would always have a mother to inherit from . < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA's appearance was close enough to resemble human , but ProtagonistA was much taller with two pairs of lithe arms , and eyes that were as dark as ink wells . ProtagonistA stood before ProtagonistA's throne and looked down upon a crowd of various races . < nl > Calmly ,  Tell it to ProtagonistA again .  ProtagonistA said . Commanding ProtagonistA's room full of advisors that gathered . ProtagonistA's restrained rage was unnerving to ProtagonistA's subjects , they all knew ProtagonistA was furious . < nl > There was a shove from one of the advisors , pushing another foreward . ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB too was near human in apperance . < nl >  Well ...  ProtagonistB struggled to find the words .  From what we surmize ... After initial seeding of the planet ... They developed according to predictions .  ProtagonistB paused for a moment . < nl >  And then ?  Said ProtagonistA . < nl >  Well , in their history they developed something called ' democracy ' , and they strayed from the proper systems of governance . It spread like a cancer ever since .  < nl >  What of their kings and queens ?  ProtagonistA said .  The central powers of nations ?  < nl >  Well ... Reduced to figure heads . Now the entire planet has become a democracy and -- after a brief rule on their fourth planet , Elon Musk King of Mars ... There has n't been a ruling monarchy since . They each vote and have equal say on their leaders and law .  < nl >  And what of ProtagonistA's daughters ?  ProtagonistA said .  Did they at least find suitable ' leaders ' in their government to strengthen our alliances ?  < nl >  They ... Are refusing to marry , and are choosing to stay among the humans . They are saying they have the right to choose what they do with their lives .  < nl > There was a murmur in the crowds as they begun to consider the host of strange new ideas they have been receiving from the humans , and they considered the implications . < nl > ProtagonistA nodded ...  Send the fleet . Glass the planets .  < eos > 
< sos > The air stinks of false pleasantries . < nl > Around a table , representatives of the mightiest empire the galaxy had ever known sits across from the upstarts in the Sol system .   A cybernetically enhanced group of humanoid creatures bearing a striking resemblance to the species of emperors and empresses .   Only a primary difference in skin color and texture , slightly metallic as a natural evolution to a heavily radiated environment . < nl > A human delegation rises and give bows of feigned respect .   They have something they call a United Nations governing their systems and colonies , making communicative talks difficult .   Too many humans have too many different forms of power .   No way to isolate and eliminate their leadership .   Their defining characteristic a hatred among their species for different beliefs , governments , even skin colors .   But all humans share one common attribute . < nl > An intense hatred of all alien races .   The way they see it , humans would rather wipe out all opposing life , in order to focus on kill each other .   Ca n't exactly blame them .   The empire had n't made a peaceful first contact . < nl > ProtagonistA rises and gives a slight nod .   ProtagonistA's generals and entourage fume , such respect is unworthy of such an entitled race . < nl > Humans are fickle .   Loud , violent , loving , hopeful , arrogant , intelligent , idiotic .   No one set of morals defines them . < nl > Nearly limitless resources , ships , armies , planets and systems kneel before ProtagonistA's throne .   Every other race would bow and scrape , awed at the magnificence of the Imperial Fleet and the limitless might of the Empire . < nl > Not the humans . < nl > There is silence .   Neither side aims to move first . < nl > ProtagonistA waves a hand .   A signal . < nl > ProtagonistB rises , puffs out ProtagonistB's chest , and reads into a translator . < nl >  We are willing to discuss terms for an armistice .  < nl > Stone faced humans .   No emotions from them , and no body language to express any kind of reaction .   Perhaps the electronics make them unable to feel . < nl > A human stands and speaks into his translator , as another moves a document towards the imperial delegation .   One rises to take it , and opens it before ProtagonistA . < nl >  We have terms .   They are non - negotiable .  < nl > ProtagonistA can sense the fury of ProtagonistA's generals , some of their arms quiver with rage .   Their teeth are clenched , eyes narrowed . < nl > ProtagonistA reads the terms . < nl > Immediate cessation of all conflict . < nl > Tributes of various sorts , technological , material , financial . < nl > Trade policies specifically benefiting human settlements . < nl > Surrender of nearly four dozen star systems near their Sol system . < nl > Dissolution of the Empire . < nl > ProtagonistA makes a brief comment and ProtagonistB stands again , speaking into that black box .   If ProtagonistB grips it any harder it will shatter . < nl >  We can not agree to the dissolution of the empire .  < nl > The humans stand in unison , sighing as if they 've heard a terrible joke . < nl >  Either agree to the terms , or we will employ them by force .  < nl > The aliens rise .   It is futile , true .   Human weapons are too precise , their drones vastly outnumbering ProtagonistA's own pilots .   Every ship in ProtagonistA's invincible army outclassed and outgunned . < nl > But ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's pride . < nl > ProtagonistA turned to leave , condemning ProtagonistA's people to death . < nl > Humans would talk about the first contact war as a minor spat .   Ancient cultures ground into dust by their own hands . < nl > None had pity for the dead . < nl > -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- < nl > r / storiesfromapotato < eos > 
< sos >  Usually when we first contact a civilization , it is very easy to get them under our banner ...  ProtagonistA sighed .  ... Not the humans though .  < nl > The assembled collection of interplanetary rulers looked on , faces carefully blank as to not show any emotion that might set ProtagonistA into a rage . Long has it been since ProtagonistA claimed ProtagonistA's throne amongst the many countless galaxies ProtagonistA had enslaved , and since then ProtagonistA's temper has been legendary for its ferociousness . < nl >  They are ...  ProtagonistA started , before trailing off as if the very words ProtagonistA needed had eluded ProtagonistA .  They are beyond our understanding .  < nl > The gathered conglomerate of rulers collectively gasped , all pretense of decor abandoned in the face of what ProtagonistA had just stated . ProtagonistA was a rock , an infallible source of leadership and knowledge . To admit that there was something that was beyond ProtagonistA was so rare that none of the species present , some of which lived for centuries , could not remember a moment where it had happened before . < nl > A brave Clixperr , a race of blue - skinned , four eyed insectoids , raised his hand .  Err , ProtagonistA ? What do ProtagonistA mean ? I mean no disrespect , but I find it hard to believe that those ... Dirt Walkers ... could be beyond ProtagonistA .  < nl > ProtagonistA's left antennae twitched , which was usually the first and only sign any creature got before they were removed from existence . Instead of incinerating the creature who dared talk out of turn , however , ProtagonistA simply closed ProtagonistA's eyes and took a deep breath , before answering . < nl >  They are ... a confusing sort ,  ProtagonistA replied , temporarily forgiving ProtagonistA's subject .  They do n't react the way most sentient creatures do .  < nl > No one spoke without being addressed this time . Life flashed before their eyes once . It was more than enough for one day . Noticing the obedient silence , ProtagonistA continued . < nl >  Our scouting drones reported back a backwater civilization . They are barely out of Beta Stage of development .  < nl > Most aliens at ProtagonistA's table shared a condoned laugh . Beta Stage of Civilized Development was the point where a civilization stopped fighting each other over resourced deemed valuable in the Alpha Stage , and started working coherently toward space travel . < nl > There had n't been a Beta Stage planet in millennia . < nl > The different creatures reveled in their mockery for scant minutes more before ProtagonistA spoke up once more , ProtagonistA's silent words cutting through the chatter like a knife .  And yet , their technology has already reached that of Nevulon Five 's .  < nl > Nevulon Five , while not the most technologically advanced of the planets under ProtagonistA's rule , was among the best regardless . The room fell into silence once more . < nl >  But ... how ?  ProtagonistB asked . ProtagonistA , apparently feeling generous , let ProtagonistB keep ProtagonistB's life as well . Such was the extent that the humans unnerved ProtagonistA . < nl >  We ... are unable to tell ,  ProtagonistA sighed .  That is but an example of a much bigger , underlying problem .  ProtagonistA leaned forward , and as one , every other person in the room leaned back .  The humans squabble . They have clear , unrestrained hatred for one another , and everything in our databases say they should take themselves out . And yet ... they do n't . They continue to thrive amongst each other even though most of their technological and sociological advances are based towards killing each other . They adapt to harsh environments for the sole purpose of proving a point , and they constantly ingest near toxic substances and perform near deadly feats to simply prove they can .  < nl > The room was deathly silent . No one dared utter a word about such odd , terrifying creatures . < nl >  Honestly , they are quite impressive . Quite insane , but in a way that would be entertaining . ProtagonistA believe we should extend every courtesy to get them to join . All those against ?  < nl > No one dared oppose . The question was a challenge , not a request . < nl >  Good . Meeting adjourned .  < nl > As the creatures left , ProtagonistA smiled a wicked smile . ProtagonistA told none of them of the humans ' tendency to conquer . They would no doubt go on a spree to eliminate everyone weaker than them , most likely starting with the weaker planets in ProtagonistA's own kingdom . < nl > At worse ? They would overthrow ProtagonistA . At best , they would whip the more pathetic ones into shape . ProtagonistA shrugged , at least it would be amusing . < nl > And most entertaining indeed . < eos > 
< sos > Welcome to Magnolia : a city without birth , without death ; a city where all your dreams become reality , until you 've lived them so God - damned often that they become a waking nightmare . Welcome to Magnolia : a city where our leading doctors will Skim off the last few hundred years of your life as if they were only fat deposits on your thighs , so that you can enjoy the thrills and spills of living all over again .   Welcome to Magnolia : a city that 's rotten to its core and whose denizens are as dry as tinder , who are only waiting for ProtagonistA to ignite them and turn them into a raging inferno . < nl > ProtagonistA's name might be Richard Eizenstat . ProtagonistA 's at the very least responsible for the placid pool of red that 's stained my boots ; ProtagonistA 's responsible for ProtagonistC's body , that lies like a pale island in the center of the blood . < nl >  Thank you for coming ,  says ProtagonistB . I recognise ProtagonistB from the holos . < nl >  Why 'd ProtagonistC do it ?  I ask , my voice an echoing growl around the small room . < nl >  ProtagonistC ... ProtagonistC was a sick man , Mr O'connell . Very sick .  ProtagonistB taps the side of ProtagonistB's head twice .  Cerebral haemorrhage during the Step - Back .  < nl > I frown .  Step - Backs do n't go wrong . Is n't that ProtagonistB's slogan ?  < nl >  ProtagonistB's * slogan * , if you must call it that , is One Step - Back , Two Steps Forward .  < nl >  My mistake . Still , I 've never heard of a Step - Back going wrong before .  < nl >  Well this one did ,  ProtagonistB replies sternly . < nl > The institution 's white room is empty apart from us . ProtagonistB does n't want this news getting out . I crouch down over the body , my knees hovering an inch above the blood . The corpse is cold and the arms are stiff but pliable . * Just * . < nl >  Maybe five hours since death , I reckon .  < nl > A dozen or so wide wounds lattice ProtagonistC's torso . A long , triangular shard of glass lies by ProtagonistC's side . There 's blood along the tip of the glass , where it stabbed ProtagonistC , and there 's blood all down its sides , too . ProtagonistD's hands must be pretty messed up right now . I wonder why ProtagonistD 'd stab ProtagonistD so many times ? It 's like a * crime passionnel * , as the ancient Europeans might have said . < nl >  Come , follow ProtagonistB ,  says ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB have something ProtagonistB need to show you .  < nl > ProtagonistB leads me through one of the institutions hallways full of locked iron doors , and I 'm already burning with curiosity . I hear noises from within the rooms : scraping , banging ... * screaming * . If nothing ever goes wrong during the Step - Backs , then who the hell are behind those doors ? < nl > We come out into a small room with an expensive looking table in the middle -- authentic wood , by the look of it . A deep , rich brown -- mahogany , maybe -- with decorative carvings around its eves . Thing must be worth as much as my apartment . < nl > Two chairs sit either side of the table . It 's the type of room I 'd have done interrogations in , once upon a time . Although , with a cheap pine table between us instead , with a couple of stained mugs full of steaming coffee marking its surface . < nl >  Sit , please ,  ProtagonistB says . It 's a demand not a request -- same with all the bullshit questions ProtagonistB asks . I pull out a chair and slump down onto it . < nl >  You perhaps know who ProtagonistB am , already ?  < nl > I grin .  I would n't be much of a detective if I did n't . ProtagonistB Daughter of Jonathan Browning , once of the three founders of Magnolia . As pretty as you are ruthless ... * so they say * .  < nl > For the first time since meeting ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB allows ProtagonistB a smile .  Oh , do * they * ? How nice of them . And ProtagonistB suppose you know why ProtagonistB 've asked for your help ?  < nl >  Seeing as I 'm the only detective in the city -- the only person with any real experience with murder cases , ProtagonistB suspect you need me . ProtagonistB mean ... * a dead body * ?  I let out a slow whistle .  That 's already going to look bad against ProtagonistB's record . And if ProtagonistE does n't get caught ... well , it 'll be historic , to say the least .  < nl >  ProtagonistE wo n't get away !  ProtagonistB shouts , slamming a fist hard against the table . Almost instantly , ProtagonistB returns to ProtagonistB's equable demeanour .  You will see to that , ProtagonistB am sure of it . Now , tell ProtagonistB , Mr O'connell-  < nl >  ProtagonistF .  < nl >  * ProtagonistF . * Why is ProtagonistF still have ProtagonistF's memories from during the Restart ? Surely it would be best for ProtagonistF to erase them -- they ca n't be pleasant to hold onto .  < nl > ProtagonistF flinch .  They 're not . But ProtagonistF figured someone has to keep these skills alive . Murder does n't wait forever . Immortality is bullshit -- all we 've done is cure ageing . And even that means nine hours a night in a vecta - coffin .  < nl > ProtagonistB cringes .  ProtagonistB do so hate that name . ProtagonistF will call it the Restorative Cube , from here on .  < nl > ProtagonistF shrug . < nl > ProtagonistB stares at ProtagonistF , drinking ProtagonistF in . ProtagonistF imagine most people find ProtagonistB's stony gaze imposing , but ProtagonistF just stare right back . < nl >  ProtagonistF must be so very bored ,  ProtagonistB says lugubriously . < nl >  ProtagonistF 've only just gotten here . Besides , ProtagonistB 're not so dull .  < nl > ProtagonistB laughs .  Not of this . * Of everything * . Of life . Of living . ProtagonistF must have done everything possible a hundred times over , and yet ProtagonistF 've not had ProtagonistF's memory Reset . ProtagonistF 're somewhat of a freak , ProtagonistF .  < nl >  I prefer * unique * . Tell ProtagonistB about ProtagonistG .  < nl >  ProtagonistG ... happened two months ago . The Step - Back failure . ProtagonistC ... ProtagonistC's mind , ProtagonistC's * memories * have leaked into each other . ProtagonistC does n't know what 's reality , and what 's fiction . A holomovie from last year , for example -- ProtagonistC can no longer tell if it happened to ProtagonistC in real life , if * ProtagonistC * was the protagonist -- or if it was indeed just a holomovie .  < nl >  So ...  < nl >  So , ProtagonistC has a lot of dangerous memories right now . ProtagonistC believes ProtagonistC has inherited many of these memories not from movies , but from other denizen 's Skims .... Skims from before the Restart .  < nl >  * Before ? *  < nl >  Yes .  < nl >  That 's ...  I whistle .  Those memories would be from long before even my time . And hell , I 'm as old as they come .  < nl >  If they were real memories , yes . But they are n't . They are fabrications .  < nl >  So , ProtagonistB 're saying ProtagonistC thinks that movies ProtagonistC 's watched are * real * memories , but from other people . People 's memories from Before .  < nl >  Exactly . ProtagonistC 's paranoid beyond reason .  < nl > ProtagonistB opens a drawer and takes out a large brown folder . ProtagonistB slides it across the desk to ProtagonistF .  It is best ProtagonistF know what ProtagonistF 're up against .  < nl >  What happens once I 've caught ProtagonistC ?  < nl >  ProtagonistC 's a heretic . We Reset ProtagonistC . There is no choice .  < nl >  And to me ?  < nl >  We Skim ProtagonistF's memory back two days prior to this meeting , and for ProtagonistF none of this ever happened .  < nl >  Then why the hell would I help ProtagonistB ? What 's the point ?  < nl >  ProtagonistF's bank account will know what ProtagonistF did . ProtagonistF's new apartment will know , and ProtagonistF's new -Platinum Forged memories will know . Beyond that , ProtagonistF will have done ProtagonistF's city a great favour that wo n't be forgotten -- at least , not by ProtagonistB .  < nl > I grunt , then nod and flip open the folder . < nl > > * * ProtagonistF with ProtagonistC * * < nl > > * * Session one * * < nl > > ProtagonistC : What is ProtagonistF's name ? < nl > > ProtagonistH : Polynomine < nl > > ProtagonistC : Polynomine ? < nl > > ProtagonistH : We have many names . < nl > > ProtagonistC : ProtagonistF's name is Richard Eizenstat . < nl > > ProtagonistH : We were ProtagonistD . We are now more . Many more . Much more . < nl > > ProtagonistC : ProtagonistF's name is Richard Eizenstat and ProtagonistF experienced an accident during Step - Back . < nl > > ProtagonistH : There was no accident . < nl > > ProtagonistC : What do ProtagonistH mean ? < nl > > ProtagonistH : Someone wanted us to become what we are . To see what there was and is and will be . < nl > > ProtagonistC : ... ProtagonistH believe someone sabotaged the Step - Back ? < nl > > ProtagonistH : Yes . < nl > > ProtagonistC : Who ? < nl > > ProtagonistH : We do n't know . There are many voices in our head and they bay for justice like starving wolves : uncontrollable and savage . We can not control them yet . We can not quieten them enough to hear the voice beneath . < nl > > ProtagonistC : What is ProtagonistH's first memory ? < nl > > ProtagonistH : We have many first memories . < nl > > ProtagonistC : What do ProtagonistH know of the Restart ? < nl > > ProtagonistH : It is a lie . There was no Restart . < nl > > ProtagonistC : A lie ? < nl > > ProtagonistH : We are taught what it is . A perfect new beginning . But it is not . < nl > > ProtagonistC : Then what was it ? < nl > > ProtagonistH : The mass extinction of humanity . < nl > > ProtagonistC : Extinction ? What caused this * extinction * ? < nl > > ProtagonistH : Clones . < nl > > ProtagonistC : * Clones ? * < nl > > ProtagonistH : Yes , clones . Like , ProtagonistC . This body too , ProtagonistC . But -- but there is humanity left . It is inside our head . And we will set them free ! We will set them all free ! < nl > > * Notes * : ProtagonistD's eyes dilate massively as ProtagonistD screams and struggles against ProtagonistD's restraints , the metal biting into ProtagonistD's wrists until they bleed . I call in security and they apply the tranquilliser to ProtagonistD's neck . It takes five minutes or so for ProtagonistD's body to go limp . It should have taken seconds . < nl > > * * End of session one * * < nl > I look away from the document and up at ProtagonistB . < nl >  Clones ?  I ask . < nl >  Outlawed tech , even before the Restart . Marked as abominations .  < nl >  Yeah , I know ... It 's just a surprise to me that ProtagonistC thinks clones could be responsible , seeing as they were never anything more than an idea .  < nl >  Yes , ProtagonistB would think that .  ProtagonistB sighs .  ProtagonistB suppose ProtagonistB should be honest with you , you 'll forget it all soon enough . Sometime before the Reset -- ProtagonistB do n't know all the details -- a handful of clones were produced for limited , closed testing . But ... there was an incident ...  < nl >  We created clones ? Jesus ...  I raise my eyebrows as I consider the implications .  So , what was incident ?  < nl >  There 's very little information on it , even in ProtagonistB's own archives -- as is the case with anything pre - Reset . But what ProtagonistB do know is that something went wrong during the closed testing . What exactly , ProtagonistB ca n't say . But suffice it to say , clones never made it to market release , and any research into them was destroyed and made illegal thereafter . Instead , ProtagonistB concentrated on limited AI subserviencey .  < nl >  So ProtagonistC could be telling the truth ? I mean , not fully -- but maybe there 's something in it ?  < nl >  No . There 's * no * possibility of it .  < nl > I nod and return to the document . < nl > --- < nl > Part 2 : https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/7c0viz/wp_everyone_is_immortal_in_the_distant_future_to/ < nl > Part 3 : https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/7c1pt0/wp_everyone_is_immortal_in_the_distant_future_to/ < eos > 
< sos > * * Yes , Yes !   This will be perfect , ProtagonistB's most fiendish plan yet . * * A shadowy sat at an immense desk made from black iron and ebony hued wood , a long quill that radiated a fell aura scratched eerily on a roll of parchment .   The room flickered with light from the fire place , a scent of spice and dark earth permeated the air .   The figure was immense , looming over the desk , wings sprouted from its back and flapped unconsciously , swirling the air .   Its focus was totally on the work before it , arcane symbols and script written in neat handwriting . < nl > The heavy iron door slid open slowly on oiled hinges .   Small clicks of talons on stone preceded ProtagonistA , they strode into the chamber with inhuman grace .   ProtagonistA's figure oozed confidence , allure , seductive danger that lies just beneath the surface of ProtagonistA's motions .   Cold yellow eyes with stilted pupils gazed at the shadow figure , a curve of a cruel lip hinted at a smile and ProtagonistA stood at its side in silence .   Eventually ProtagonistA coughs , a quiet noise that shot across the room . < nl > * * Ah , ProtagonistA .   What brings ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB's chamber . * * The shadow did n't turn from its task , continuing to write and make other hidden notes on an other scroll of parchment . < nl > ProtagonistA bowed , arm sweeping out in an old fashioned gesture .    ProtagonistA's Dread Lord Vel'tora , Lord of Shadows , Knight of the Ebon Chalice .   Doom scribe , Chronicler of the Outer Black-  < nl > * * Yes yes , those are ProtagonistB's titles .   Thank ProtagonistA ProtagonistA .   Why are ProtagonistA interrupting ProtagonistB's work ?   ProtagonistB have little time left before ProtagonistB begin ProtagonistB's next task .   All must be ready . * * < nl > ProtagonistA floated closer , curiosity written all over ProtagonistA's face and ProtagonistA could n't keep a tone of wonder from ProtagonistA's voice .    We , ProtagonistB's humble servants , are ... curious ProtagonistB .   We have noticed that ProtagonistB have been busy of late , especially every 7th day .   ProtagonistB keep to ProtagonistB in here and we wished to offer our services .   We would delight in aiding ProtagonistB .  < nl > ProtagonistB nodded , calmly as if knowing this all along .   * * You aid is appreciated if unnecessary .   Your goals are to continue to maintain the estates , protect the realm , and prepare for the next Confluence of Fire .   This matter is .... personal . * * < nl > Curiosity piqued , ProtagonistA tried to wheedle some more .    Personal ProtagonistB ?   Please , ProtagonistB know of ProtagonistA's abilities .   ProtagonistA could help ProtagonistB .   ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB speak of ProtagonistB's most fiendish plan yet .   ProtagonistA ca n't help but-  The breath froze in ProtagonistA's throat as ProtagonistB turned and gave ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's attention .   ProtagonistA's knees buckled and ProtagonistA fell to the floor , bowing ProtagonistA's head in contrition .    M - ProtagonistA's apologies ProtagonistB !   Please forgive ProtagonistA !  < nl > ProtagonistB turned away and a weight lifted off of ProtagonistA .   * * No matter .   ProtagonistA do not draw ProtagonistB's ire .   In any other task ProtagonistB would welcome ProtagonistA's assistance .   However this task is ProtagonistB , and mine alone .   Perhaps it will be repeated for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA will learn in time . * * < nl > Before ProtagonistA could speak again the air shivered , a silver bell began to ring filling the air with a quivering tinkle .   ProtagonistB turned to a large mirror along one wall , a light pouring forth from reflection .   * * Ahh , it is time .   ProtagonistB will return in several hours ProtagonistA .   ProtagonistA are in command of the Citadel until ProtagonistB's return . * *   ProtagonistB gathered up the rolls of parchment and glided to the mirror .   With a touch it blazed with light causing ProtagonistA to look away .   Blinking away the after images ProtagonistA left the chambers , daring a glance at the mirror .   * A table ? * < nl > The room filled with plumes of inky purple smoke .   The walls quaked and from the smoke rose the cowled form of Vel'tora .   * * ProtagonistB have returned to the Mortal plane !   Who dares summon ProtagonistB and are you prepared to pay the price ? ! * * < nl >  Hey ProtagonistB !   We are so ready .   Been waiting all week !   We got tons of pizza and we are yours for the next 6 hours .    A grinning girl set an open box of pizza before ProtagonistB and the 4 other young folks cheered , applauding at ProtagonistB's arrival . < nl > A smile crossed Vel'tora 's hidden face and ProtagonistB nodded appreciatively at the steaming pizza .   * * Your offering is accepted .   Now !   When last we left your heroes ... * * < eos > 
< sos > * Two hundred twenty five divided by 2 minus one hundred ... wait . What were the order of operations again ! ? * < nl > ProtagonistA's hands slammed against the smooth table ProtagonistA was working on , mechanical pencil soaring off into the abyss of math related torture . ProtagonistA's shaking fingers found their way to ProtagonistA's face , feeling ProtagonistA burn with frustration . < nl > * Just 2 more years . Just two more years . * ProtagonistA took in a deep breath . All ProtagonistA had to do was make it through these last few years and ProtagonistA would be free . These thoughts were the only thing that kept ProtagonistA going , the only dream that forced ProtagonistA to get up each morning . Just two more years and ProtagonistA would be free . < nl > ProtagonistA released ProtagonistA's breath slowly , the math assignment flapping lazily in the path of the airflow . It almost felt like it was taunting ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistA frowned , eyeing ProtagonistA's opponent between parted fingers . < nl > * You know , * ProtagonistA thought , lowering ProtagonistA's hands slowly , * ProtagonistA can end your meaningless existence with ProtagonistA's bare hands , you worthless hunk of tree feces . * < nl > A sudden sound drew ProtagonistA's eyes from ProtagonistA's quarry . ProtagonistB let out a noise that half resembled a choke and a sneeze . ProtagonistB threw a quick glance towards ProtagonistA and , after meeting ProtagonistA's gaze , visably paled before turning back to ProtagonistB's own assignment . < nl > ProtagonistA was sure it was just a coincidence , but it sure sounded like ProtagonistB just laughed at ProtagonistA's threat towards an inanimate object . It was with a jolt that ProtagonistA suddenly realised that ProtagonistB was n't just any boy , but Phillip Greyson . The One Hit Wonder . < nl > ProtagonistA's face flushed again , this time with embarrassment . Yet , why should ProtagonistA be embarrassed ?   It 's not like ProtagonistB could actually hear ProtagonistA . And yet ... < nl > ProtagonistA stared directly at the mat of dark hair that was the back of ProtagonistB's head . Without so much as an after thought ProtagonistA commenced ProtagonistA's experiment . < nl > * ProtagonistB * , ProtagonistA screamed in ProtagonistA's head , expectantly watching for a reaction . Nothing . Not even a flinch . ProtagonistA would have to try harder . < nl > * YOUR FLY IS DOWN ProtagonistB * , ProtagonistA's gaze   seemed to pierce the back of ProtagonistB's head as ProtagonistA focused all of ProtagonistA's willpower into ProtagonistA's assult . Not even a single glance down to check on ProtagonistB's manhood for all of ProtagonistA's efforts . < nl > ProtagonistA felt a tap on ProtagonistA's shoulder . < nl >  ProtagonistA !  Came a whisper in ProtagonistA's left ear ,  ProtagonistA ProtagonistA got to hurry ! Class is almost over and ProtagonistA 're down a writing utensil !  < nl > ProtagonistA rolled ProtagonistA's eyes at ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA had known ProtagonistC since the 4th grade . In ProtagonistA's eyes , they were practically sisters . < nl >  ProtagonistA got it , ProtagonistA got it .  ProtagonistA whispered back , glancing at the math teacher before locating ProtagonistA's pencil on the other side of the room . It was laying on the floor beside ProtagonistB's foot . < nl > * Great , * ProtagonistA thought , exhaling sharply . ProtagonistA did n't rise from ProtagonistA's seat , however , and instead looked at the back of ProtagonistB's head once more . < nl > * ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB can hear ProtagonistA , * ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA , practically flinging each word towards ProtagonistB's brain . * Pick up ProtagonistA's pencil for ProtagonistA . * < nl > ProtagonistB did n't move or make any indication ProtagonistB had heard ProtagonistA's demand . ProtagonistA smirked and tried again . * Pick up ProtagonistA's pencil for ProtagonistA , please . ProtagonistA wo n't tell anyone ProtagonistB can hear ProtagonistA . * Nothing . < nl > ProtagonistA frowned , leaning back in ProtagonistA's chair .   No , ProtagonistB could n't read minds . The world just did n't work like that . Two more years of school . Two more years of boring , usless knowledge ProtagonistA needed to be free . Two more years until ProtagonistA could leave ProtagonistB . Two more long , frightening years of abuse before ProtagonistA could move out . * That 's * the way the world worked . < nl > ProtagonistA closed ProtagonistA's eyes with a soft sigh . No one was going to rescue ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was stupid to even toy with the idea of ProtagonistB being a mind reader . After all , if ProtagonistB could read minds , ProtagonistB would n't be known as The One Hit Wonder . ProtagonistB would be able to stay with a girl for more than one date , surely , and would n't have misunderstood ProtagonistA's intentions that night ... < nl > A sound caught ProtagonistA's attention , and ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes to see ProtagonistB's face darken as half of ProtagonistB's pencil fell to the floor , snapped by the force of ProtagonistB's grip . < nl > * ProtagonistA knew it ... * , ProtagonistA thought triumphantly , standing quickly and making ProtagonistA's chair scrape across the tiled floor . < nl >  ProtagonistA knew it !  ProtagonistA repeated , out loud this time . The whole class turned to stare at ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB included . The dark expression had gone from ProtagonistB's pale face and was replaced with one resembling prey about to be devoured . < nl > ProtagonistA stared directly into ProtagonistB's eyes , green into blue , deep forest into unexplored ocean , and thought quietly , * ProtagonistA need ProtagonistB's help . * < nl > Slowly , ProtagonistB nodded . < nl > ( This is ProtagonistA's first time answering a writing prompt on Reddit , and ProtagonistA 'm also on mobile . ProtagonistA apologise for terrible formatting if it did n't come out properly ! ) < nl > ( ( * * EDIT * * : Thank you kind stranger for ProtagonistA's first reddit gold ! ! And thank you to everyone who read / replied / gave feedback ! It means the world to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA never expected ProtagonistA's first writing prompt response to get so much attention ! ProtagonistA hope you all have a fantastic day because you sure made ProtagonistA ! ) ) < nl > ( ( * * EDIT 2 * * : There are a few of you asking if ProtagonistA will be continuing this story . ProtagonistA actually have a book / project ProtagonistA am currently working on , therefore ProtagonistA probably wo n't be adding much more to this particular story . But ProtagonistA 'll definitely be answering more writing prompts so be on the lookout ! ) ) < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA had never travelled this far east before . ProtagonistA chose to hike the last stretch of ProtagonistA's journey , leaving ProtagonistA's beat - up car under a tarpaulin , tucked behind a copse of trees . Nature had beat back man 's progress here , and all ProtagonistA had for company were the skittish wildlife , the rush of the waterfalls , the snowflakes cascading down belligerently . Walking rejuvenated ProtagonistA , but more importantly , it gave ProtagonistA a chance to attune ProtagonistA's senses , probe for ProtagonistB . < nl > ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB perched on a rocky outcrop , just a couple of miles from Seydisfjordur . ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA made no noise , left barely an imprint on the fresh snow beneath ProtagonistA's feet , but before such an experienced master , ProtagonistA might as well have been beating a drum , strumming a lyre . < nl >  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA come in peace ,  ProtagonistA said , keeping ProtagonistA's distance . ProtagonistA used the honorific so that ProtagonistB would know that ProtagonistA was cut from the same cloth , another member of the ancient clan sworn to protect their country . Underneath ProtagonistA's shawl , ProtagonistA gripped ProtagonistA's twin knives , priming ProtagonistA's defences . It never hurt to be prudent . < nl > ProtagonistB turned then , and for a moment ProtagonistA wondered if the reports were embellished . There was a placid calmness to ProtagonistB , and none of the fire and brimstone ProtagonistA was cautioned about . ProtagonistB's eyes , dulled with age , reminded ProtagonistA of the frozen orbs ProtagonistA sometimes had to scrape out of bowls ProtagonistA had left out . < nl >  ProtagonistB do n't recall asking to be relieved ,  ProtagonistB said .  ProtagonistB am not yet battle - weary . ProtagonistB intend to guard this town until ProtagonistB die .  < nl >  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB have done us a great service ,  ProtagonistA replied .  The records run with the great deeds ProtagonistB have accomplished . ProtagonistB have saved this town more times than anyone can count . ProtagonistB have more than earned ProtagonistB's rest .  < nl > ProtagonistB scrounged on the ground , picked up a couple of smoothened pebbles . ProtagonistA narrowed ProtagonistA's eyes , but this time ProtagonistA was over - suspicious - ProtagonistB aimed the small missiles not at ProtagonistA , but at three spots away from them , one to the north and the others to the west . There was but a bleak light still illuminating the valley , so ProtagonistA relied instead on ProtagonistA's hearing to determine where the pebbles landed . < nl >  Those are where the rifts are ,  said ProtagonistB , dusting ProtagonistB's palms off .  The monsters do n't come as often now , but they still can , and they still do . They are different from the ones you deal with back in Reykjavik , or wherever the hell you came from . Nature emboldens them . They do n't emerge at night , skulking in the shadows . No , these prefer the day , where they revel in being seen , being feared . There 's a sadism in these parts that only I can handle , ProtagonistA .  < nl > There 's a sadism alright , thought ProtagonistA , but instead ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA will be straightforward , ProtagonistB . This is not a request . The Council has asked that ProtagonistB retire , with immediate effect .  < nl >  Oh ? After all the good work ProtagonistB 've done ?  < nl >  Too good , in fact ,  said ProtagonistA .  Reports have come in that ProtagonistB no longer communicate with the town , that ProtagonistB have completely shut ProtagonistB off from them . The local children do n't even dare come near ProtagonistB anymore , and they have started calling ProtagonistB the Boogeyman , the Reaper . Even worse , the monsters that ProtagonistB slay ... ProtagonistB 're not just putting them down , ProtagonistB 're * slaughtering * them . The Council has reason to believe that you-  < nl > ProtagonistB chose to move at that moment , streaking in a blur towards highground . ProtagonistA was ready , and so ProtagonistA followed closely behind , matching ProtagonistB step for step . ProtagonistA considered the possibility that ProtagonistB was leading ProtagonistA towards a trap , but pushed that thought away . ProtagonistA had to believe that there was humanity yet left in ProtagonistB . < nl > Some hundred feet above the ground , a cave opened up alongside the hill , hidden if one were only looking in from the roads . ProtagonistB paused there , then snapped ProtagonistB's fingers , bringing to life the candles within . ProtagonistA discerned immediately the two urns on one side of the cave , and the heaps of ash on the other . < nl >  They took ProtagonistB's family , was that in ProtagonistA's reports too ?  ProtagonistB asked .  ProtagonistB had just saved the town from another invasion , took down no less than three ghouls and two ogres on ProtagonistB's own . They come in waves , so ProtagonistB thought we were safe for a while . But they were hiding , down by the waters when ProtagonistE went to swim . ProtagonistC struggled with them , but ProtagonistC is no practitioner of glima that ProtagonistB am .  < nl > In that moment , ProtagonistA understood why the Council had chosen ProtagonistA , of all the practitioners , and a tiny bit of the tension in ProtagonistA seeped away . ProtagonistA was not going to die here today , after all .  No words can convey ProtagonistA's condolences ,  ProtagonistA said , eventually . < nl > ProtagonistB did n't seem to hear .  And everyday , everyday ProtagonistB add on to the ashes of ProtagonistB's enemies . ProtagonistB think , maybe , when there 's enough of it , it will all make sense again , feel right again .  < nl >  Has it worked ?  < nl >  No ,  said ProtagonistB ,  not yet . And that is why ProtagonistB can not stop , ProtagonistA see ? ProtagonistB have to keep going . ProtagonistB have to keep-  < nl > ProtagonistA lashed out , ProtagonistA's knives glinting as they sung through the air . ProtagonistA was not given to surprise attacks , but ProtagonistB was an opponent far more skilled than ProtagonistA was , and ProtagonistA would have to take what the gods of chance gave ProtagonistA . Heck , ProtagonistA had only felled the one ogre in ProtagonistA's life , and that was quite an anemic one at that . < nl > ProtagonistB caught ProtagonistA's blows easily , striking at ProtagonistA's wrists , deflecting ProtagonistA's attacks . ProtagonistB stepped in , pushed ProtagonistB's shoulder against ProtagonistA's midriff , then lifted ProtagonistA's legs . ProtagonistA tensed and recoiled , twisting in the air , landing on ProtagonistA's feet . If ProtagonistA fell , it was over . < nl > Round and round they went , like marbles in a cone , striking and rebounding , feinting and parrying . At times it seemed that ProtagonistA , had the edge . But ProtagonistB would come back , a crashing fjord of implacable power , brushing ProtagonistA off like a weevil . Then , a slip , as ProtagonistA's foot caught on an uneven patch of ground , throwing ProtagonistA off just a couple of inches . < nl > ProtagonistB seized the moment , overwhelming ProtagonistA with a deathgrip . ProtagonistA kept still , quivering despite ProtagonistA's best efforts . ProtagonistA was at ProtagonistB's mercy . < nl >  Why does the Council stop ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistB asked , breathing heavily .  Can a man not have his revenge ?  < nl >  ProtagonistB are showing signs of taint , ProtagonistB ! Do ProtagonistB not see that ? In a year , or two , will ProtagonistB's bloodlust have calmed ?  < nl >  ProtagonistB am * in control * !  ProtagonistB said .  Why do ProtagonistA think ProtagonistB have not snapped ProtagonistA's neck ?  < nl > ProtagonistA sighed , then relinquished ProtagonistA's knives , dropping them to the ground . ProtagonistB had not yet yielded in the face of ProtagonistA's surrender , so there was only one course of action left . < nl >  ProtagonistA bring with ProtagonistA too another message from the Council ,  ProtagonistA said .  Straight from ProtagonistD's mouth , ProtagonistD . ProtagonistD bids ProtagonistA to remind ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB have done ProtagonistB's part , that ProtagonistB deserve , at the least , some rest . ' Any of us can quell the monsters , ProtagonistB , but only you can tend to ProtagonistB's wounds . Let ProtagonistA carry on ProtagonistB's work for ProtagonistB . ' That is what ProtagonistD said .  < nl > ProtagonistA waited , and eventually ProtagonistB loosened ProtagonistB's hold . ProtagonistA broke free , then turned to assess ProtagonistB . The fight had deserted ProtagonistB , and the hunch in ProtagonistB's back , the despair on ProtagonistB's brows - there was no more duelling to be had . ProtagonistB averted ProtagonistB's gaze , but ProtagonistA caught the hint of moistness in ProtagonistB's eyes . < nl >  ProtagonistE ... ProtagonistE would be around ProtagonistA's age , if ProtagonistE were still alive , ProtagonistA know ?  ProtagonistB said , staring off into the distance . < nl > You bastards , ProtagonistA thought . It 's not fair sending ProtagonistE to fight ProtagonistD . That 's just underhanded . < nl >  ProtagonistA know ,  ProtagonistA said . < nl > There they sat , as the sun completed its retreat , and the stars reclaimed their fair share of the heavens . From the distance they heard the merriment from the town - preparations were underway for the winter festivals , and ProtagonistA sensed that even the monsters would have the decency to stay away this night . < nl >  Where 's good for dinner ?  ProtagonistA asked , tentatively . < nl > ProtagonistB sighed .  ProtagonistB can show ProtagonistA , if ProtagonistA like .  < nl > ProtagonistA smiled . < nl > --- < nl > /r / rarelyfunny < eos > 
< sos > The Vytuta eat clams from the shallows , but this was not always so .   Long ago , before any Vytuta had ever clapped his hands and stomped his feet in the Dance of the Yellow Hyacinth , and before Pralih had ever etched the face of ProtagonistA , the Vytuta stayed far away from the shallows , living up high in the cloudy hills . < nl > Up high in the cloudy hills , the Vytuta slept in a cave with hard , dry stones to lay upon .   They kindled the fire , which is ProtagonistA's kiss , from dry grasses , and filled their bowls with cool water that trickled down the hillside .   When ProtagonistA rose at dawn , and warmed all the land with ProtagonistA's hot breath , the Vytuta would come forth from the cave .   The noble Vytuta hunters would chase the goats into the crevasse , and hope that some would fall on the sharp rocks .   The noble hunters would cook the meat from the goats and , when there was enough , share it with all the Vytuta .   The women would make warm coverings with the goat hides , in which to first wrap the babies , and then the men and women . < nl > One day , when ProtagonistA rose at dawn , and warmed all the land with ProtagonistA's hot breath , the Vytuta came forth from the cave .   As they did each day , the noble hunters followed the goats by their footprints and dung .   But this day , instead of finding the goats , the hunters found ProtagonistB .   ProtagonistB had no hides for coverings , and hid ProtagonistB's nakedness behind a spruce tree , and was shivering .   ProtagonistC , called out to ProtagonistB . < nl >  ProtagonistB , tell us who ProtagonistB are ,  ProtagonistC demanded ,  for ProtagonistB are not a maiden of the Vytuta , who do not show their nakedness to ProtagonistA .  < nl >  ProtagonistB , tell us where ProtagonistB have come from ,  ProtagonistF , implored ProtagonistB ,  for ProtagonistB are too dirty to have come from the cave , where the Vytuta wash in the cool water that trickles down the hillside .  < nl >  ProtagonistB come from the shallows ,  ProtagonistB replied ,  where each day would ProtagonistB walk with ProtagonistE along the pebbles and sand , and we would look up at the cloudy hills .   One day , ProtagonistD noticed ProtagonistB , and declared that ProtagonistB was to be ProtagonistD's bride .   But ProtagonistB did not desire ProtagonistD .   When ProtagonistB refused ProtagonistD , ProtagonistD grew angry and sent a great wave .   The wave did not stop until it had carried off ProtagonistB's all coverings and trapped ProtagonistE on a wet and dangerous rock .   ProtagonistD declared that only when ProtagonistB return to ProtagonistD will ProtagonistD free ProtagonistE , and let ProtagonistB hide ProtagonistB's nakedness .   Please , noble hunters of the Vytuta , return with ProtagonistB to the shallows , and conquer ProtagonistD , so that ProtagonistE and ProtagonistB may break from ProtagonistD's curse !  < nl > ProtagonistB then threw ProtagonistB to the dirt and kissed the feet of Ratem and Rasih .   ProtagonistB pleaded for them to climb to the bottom of the hill and confront ProtagonistD on ProtagonistB's behalf . < nl > Ratem and Rasih took ProtagonistB to the cave , where the shaman slept on the hard stones .   The shaman made the poultice from the mushrooms , which are ProtagonistA's blisters , which grow in the farthest corner of the cave .   The shaman rubbed the poultice on his chest and tongue , and stared into ProtagonistA's kiss , to read ProtagonistA's omens . < nl >  ProtagonistD is cruel ,  the shaman declared ,  and steals away maidens , who were made by ProtagonistA , and are sacred to ProtagonistA .   The noble Vytuta hunters will defeat ProtagonistD , and they will have ProtagonistA's blessing .  < nl > The shaman then spoke of two special stones , which rested on the hillside .   These stones were shaped like the bowls from which the Vytuta drink cool water .   The hunters Ratem and Rasih were to bring these stones down the hillside , to the shallows .   Then , they were to stand back to back and ford through ProtagonistD's terrible squalls , using the stones to protect ProtagonistB from the waves , until ProtagonistB had recovered ProtagonistE . < nl > So Ratem and Rasih did as ProtagonistA had ordered .   They found the peculiar stones , that were shaped like the bowls from which the Vytuta drink cool water .   They carried the stones down to the shallows , where the squalls blew strongly .   The brothers stood together , holding up the stones , and ProtagonistB walked behind , remaining safe from the wind , and dry .   They followed the cries of ProtagonistE , and soon found ProtagonistE amid the surf .   ProtagonistB reached out ProtagonistB's hand , and pulled ProtagonistE down from the dangerous rock . < nl > The two hunters and ProtagonistE began to retreat from the shallows .   But ProtagonistD saw that ProtagonistD was being defeated , and grew vengeful .   ProtagonistD redoubled the strength of ProtagonistD's waves and wind , and soon the two hunters and ProtagonistE were forced to huddle among the reeds .   They hid from ProtagonistD for days , who all the while called out for ProtagonistB , extolling ProtagonistB's beauty .   As ProtagonistA had sworn , the curved stones remained strong , protecting the brothers and ProtagonistE from every gust and bellow .   At last , ProtagonistD had no choice but to relent . < nl > ProtagonistE wept and thanked the brothers for rescuing ProtagonistE , imploring them to return at once up the hillside to the Vytuta .   But ProtagonistF , had heard ProtagonistD extoll the beauty of ProtagonistB for so many days , and now loved ProtagonistB as well .   Fearing ProtagonistB might choose ProtagonistC instead , ProtagonistF took the curved stone and pushed ProtagonistC into the mud .   ProtagonistC hit ProtagonistC's head on a rock , and began to slumber .   ProtagonistF then ravished ProtagonistB in the surf , as ProtagonistE cried and beat against ProtagonistF's back . < nl > When ProtagonistC at last awoke from ProtagonistC's blow , ProtagonistF was ravishing ProtagonistB once more .   So ProtagonistC lifted up the two curved stones and trapped ProtagonistF within them .   ProtagonistC tied up the stones with reeds and hurled them into ProtagonistD .   Alone , ProtagonistC ushered ProtagonistB and ProtagonistE away from ProtagonistD and up the hillside . < nl > Trapped within , ProtagonistF banged against the stones again and again , calling out to ProtagonistC , and then to ProtagonistE , and then to ProtagonistA .   But though ProtagonistF had rescued ProtagonistB bravely , ProtagonistF had been no better than ProtagonistD when ProtagonistF ravished ProtagonistB .   So ProtagonistA cursed ProtagonistF to reside there forever .   ProtagonistA struck the stones that held ProtagonistF with a bolt of lightning .   The stones shattered into a hundred clamshells , and ProtagonistF became the clams within each of them . < nl > But because ProtagonistF had helped save ProtagonistE , and because ProtagonistC had honored ProtagonistA in the name of the Vytuta , ProtagonistA showed the hunters how to fish for the clams , and how to cook them .   Soon , the Vytuta would descend the hillside each day , and catch may clams in the shallows , who did not run away as the goats did .   The Vytuta would carry many bowls of clams back to the cave .   Each night , when the Vytuta would make the fire , which is ProtagonistA's kiss , there would be enough clams to fill the bellies of every man and woman , and the Vytuta would praise ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's blessing , and they would thank ProtagonistC for honoring ProtagonistA . < eos > 
< sos >  It 's the Mesolithic period ,  ProtagonistA spoke from the corner of the table , ProtagonistA's eyes peering on ProtagonistA's screen . It was just moments before when the entire team spoke to the alien delegation and the number popped up . 13,000 years ago . < nl >  Meso - what ?  ProtagonistB cuts in , making ProtagonistB's way to where ProtagonistA was seated . As a representative from the government , ProtagonistB could not care less about the historical or scientific details . ProtagonistB's job was to make sure everything goes smoothly according to what ProtagonistB's bosses wanted . These experts were just here to support , not interfere . < nl >  Mesolithic ,  ProtagonistA repeated , slower this time .  It was before the first recorded instance of the human civilization .  < nl > ProtagonistA pushed ProtagonistA's chair back as the rest of the team joined ProtagonistB . They stared at humanity 's timeline on the screen . It was on a slide that ProtagonistA usually used for ProtagonistA's history lectures . < nl >  So ... the aliens are lying then ?  ProtagonistC blurted out . ProtagonistC was a professor , just like ProtagonistA , only in a different field . Part of the team hastily put together when the alien 's ship magically appeared at the Paya Lebar Airbase . No radar picked it up , no eyewitness saw the ship landing . < nl > One moment there was an empty runway and the next a ship almost the size of a football field materialized out of thin air . It caught everyone off - guard . The only good thing was that the authorities were able to keep the news from spreading panic among the populace . < nl >  ProtagonistB do n't trust them ,  ProtagonistB grunted as ProtagonistB stepped away from the table . The alien delegation made many preposterous claims . That humans were once an advanced species . Almost 13,000 years ago . They also claimed that humanity launched a starship back then , followed by several others . They were certain humanity would become a spacefaring species soon after . < nl >  But then , all we could observe was silence .  The words of the alien leader still hung in ProtagonistB's head . < nl >  Should we notify the UN , or even the US , for this matter ?  another voice piped out , belonging to Dr Tan , the biologist in the room .  Surely they would have better advice ?  < nl > ProtagonistB sighed and shook ProtagonistB's head .  ProtagonistB 've already explained , we do n't know how the US would react to this . Which is why we 're under strict instructions not to let this leak out before we know what we 're dealing with .  < nl > ProtagonistB raised ProtagonistB's head to see the digital clock above the room . The aliens must be wondering what was taking them so long . It was going to be a long talk , ProtagonistB suspected . ProtagonistB motioned to the rest of the team .  Come on , take all your notes with you . We 're going back in .  < nl > The team were halfway to the door when it barged open and ProtagonistD ran in . ProtagonistD was panting and ProtagonistD's uniform was drenched in sweat . < nl >  There 's ... there 's another ship flying in ! And , and command said that ... that they 're humans ! Please-  < nl > Before ProtagonistD could finish , a bright red shot pierced through ProtagonistD's body . ProtagonistD let out a gasp and fell unto the floor . At the end of the corridor , ProtagonistB saw the figure of the alien , with a rifle pointed at the rest of them . < nl >  It seems that discussions are no longer necessary ,  the alien announced before it pulled the trigger . < nl > ------------------ < nl > /r / dori_tales < eos > 
< sos > * God , I miss Wi - Fi . * < nl > ProtagonistA , all things considered , trudged through the rain - soaked mud of something vaguely resembling 21st Century Scotland . For many weeks , ProtagonistA continued ProtagonistA's long march north , fingers frozen to ProtagonistA's quarterstaff , whole body shivering despite ProtagonistA's thick woolen cloak , and yet ProtagonistA did not relent , for this woman - Fiona , as ProtagonistA was known best - had a quest . < nl > * And Taxis . And heating . And not going on quests . * < nl > When the Dragons had first arrived , ProtagonistA had been shocked . Delighted , awed , more curious than ProtagonistA 'd ever found ProtagonistA , but absolutely , unequivocally , mind - bogglingly * stunned . * < nl > To ProtagonistA , it was as if the universe had finally admitted it had always been ridiculous , and was now attempting to own it . < nl > And with the Dragons , came magic . Not immediately , but wherever the Fae Folk - as the menagerie of creatures that looked as though they 'd been torn directly from storybooks had proudly dubbed themselves - went , strange things followed . It was as if their very presence awakened new rules in the universe . Wherever they went , so did the magic . < nl > It was small , to begin with . Sometimes , someone would wake up and find themselves suddenly beautiful , or young , or healthy , with no explanation as to how . Certain people became gifted with extraordinary glibness to such a degree that laws had begun being filed to prevent the misuse of such magics - really , ProtagonistA respected their initiative - not to mention a host of other magical effects . < nl > But then things had started going wrong . In remote areas , small devices stopped working on an international level , then radio , then electricity itself , before the world had realized what was happening . Then came The Crash , and with it , The Fall of The Modern World . < nl > All over Planet Earth , like a city skyline , all the lights went out - one by one , every computer died , every lightbulb went black , every vehicle just * stopped . * < nl > People died . Lots of them . Rumours said that there were talks of bringing war to the Fae , to the Dragons , believing that The Crash was intentional on their part , but what were rumours nowadays ? And really , what chance did humanity stand , if it came to that ? < nl > ProtagonistA cursed under ProtagonistA's breath as ProtagonistA continued ProtagonistA's quiet march . < nl > ProtagonistA wanted to break the staff in ProtagonistA's hand in two , but ProtagonistA was n't the kind to turn away an advantage when it presented itself . ProtagonistA was n't especially skilled with magic - not even amongst humans , who , as far as ProtagonistA could tell , had less than no natural predisposition to the skill - but there was no downside ProtagonistA knew of so long as ProtagonistA did n't exhaust ProtagonistA , and , frankly , it was ProtagonistA's only asset right now . < nl > Well , that , ProtagonistA's zombie apocalypse survival plan ( because ProtagonistA 'd always known it 'd be useful eventually ) , and what ProtagonistA personally liked to call ProtagonistA's logic detector . < nl > Apparently , when magic became a thing , most people decided to abandon common sense in favour of spending all day wishing they could shoot lasers from their eyes . < nl > ProtagonistA could see the appeal in eye lasers , of course , but they were going about it all wrong . < nl > When a new , powerful , dangerous force which you know absolutely * nothing * about suddenly appears along with the beasts and people of myth , do you poke it with a stick ? < nl > No . Of course not . You put on a labcoat , and gently prod it , recording how it reacts . < nl > With safety goggles . < nl > Thus far , ProtagonistA had discovered that A ) ProtagonistA could slightly alter the colour , temperature , texture , and , if ProtagonistA pushed ProtagonistA slightly , material of a reasonably small object , and that B ) magic was inscrutable , deliberately obtuse , and unfair . < nl > Despite all ProtagonistA's testing , there was just no * reason * to any of it . It was n't a mental block - simple tests with blindfolds and the like had revealed that - there was no understandable limit on the types of things ProtagonistA 'd managed to change - ProtagonistA could alter most inanimate objects , certain plants ( but not any other living creatures , and a few plants had stubbornly refused to change ) , and once , when feeling particularly frustrated , had accidentally managed to turn ProtagonistA's hair bright pinkish - red . < nl > As it stood , ProtagonistA was making about as good a use of ProtagonistA's power as ProtagonistA could manage . ProtagonistA had managed to make ProtagonistA's map glow , which , for what it 's worth , did make it readable . < nl > Unfortunately , ProtagonistA could only maintain one effect at a time . Thus , freezing . < nl > ProtagonistA 'd acquired the map in the ruins of Leeds . It promised a small settlement with working power - the whole thing set running by a series of hydropower turbines built in the nearby lake . ProtagonistA was n't sure whether that sort of thing would be simple enough to evade magic 's nullification - assuming that it was all magic 's fault in the first place , though ProtagonistA was comfortable with that educated guess - but it was ProtagonistA's best bet , and who knows ? Perhaps a large constant stream of energy immediately fed into a device that only consumes a small amount of power - say , a light bulb - might be able to sustain itself ? < nl > ProtagonistA was n't sure , but it was worth testing , and it beat scavenging in Leeds of all places . < nl > Besides , contrary to ProtagonistA's previous statement , ProtagonistA really felt like poking magic with a stick right now . < nl > --- < nl > ProtagonistA sat on a worn , blue sofa , the massed armies of lint retreating into the folds of its cushions , making way for the giant come to destroy their home . < nl > ProtagonistA sat clutching a large mug of tea in both hands . Teabags were a rarity nowadays , and this was amongst the last of ProtagonistA's supply , but ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA 'd earned it . < nl > You see , in the immediate aftermath of the crash , ProtagonistA had made a list of all the important information ProtagonistA 'd been able to gather . It had been so sudden ProtagonistA did n't have much to go off of , but the list was as follows ; < nl > Firstly , magic had started affecting the more remote areas first , disabling tiny devices like remote - control toys and phone chargers before anything else . < nl > Secondly , The Crash had been almost instant , worldwide . There had been no time zone advantage , as far as ProtagonistA knew . It was as if magic 's suppressing force had simply reached breaking point , and swept across the world suddenly and without mercy . < nl > And finally , magic did seem to care about complexity . The Crash had lasted about an hour , in total , and during that time , the internet had lasted around 10 minutes with spotty connection . There had been reports on the carnage as planes fell from the sky , crushing the earth below them , and any populated road was left devastated . Throughout the entire event , however , ProtagonistA's phone had stubbornly managed to stay active , even if it 's primary use was long gone . < nl > These things put together , ProtagonistA's pet theory - one of them , at least - had been that magic was n't passive in location , that it was affecting certain areas first due to reasons other than total amount of technology . ProtagonistA thought that certain conditions must be met before it could simply ' turn off ' everything , and , following that , that if it was n't absolute , it could be fought . < nl > The right kind of simple technology , that which acted as a direct result of being fed power or , for the most part , worked independently , might be able to sustain itself . < nl > And so it was that ProtagonistA sat with a smug grin on ProtagonistA's face , happily drinking ProtagonistA's tea , as ProtagonistA basked in the dim , yellow , glow of a lightbulb . < nl > * Today is a good day * . < nl > --- < nl > ProtagonistA really was not expecting the response this story got . Thank you all so much for what you 've said , ProtagonistA was grinning like a maniac all day yesterday . ProtagonistA 've wrote several follow - ups to this and deleted half of them , but this is the best one ProtagonistA 've managed to write , even if it is n't as long as the first . ProtagonistA 'll make sure to think about turning this into a book ( Whether it 's a novel , novella , short story , etc ) , and ProtagonistA 'll PM anyone who said they were interested in the idea when and if it comes out , but until then , really , thank you so much . ProtagonistA 'm glad you liked this . < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA awoke to the doorbell .  Hrmph ,  ProtagonistA muttered , and tucked ProtagonistA's head beneath ProtagonistA's pillow . The doorbell rang again . < nl > Slowly , ProtagonistA sat up . ProtagonistB had already gone to work , the smell of coffee lingered in the kitchen . < nl > Happy to pretend ProtagonistA was not home , ProtagonistA poured ProtagonistA a cup of leftover coffee , and went to see the note that ProtagonistB had left beside it ,  Have a good day , ProtagonistB's love ,  ProtagonistB wrote , with a small heart at the bottom . < nl > Work was long . ProtagonistA pulled together the books for the day , the store did not , in fact , fall apart , despite a few customers that claimed that it did . < nl > But the best part of the day , as it always was , was coming home to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB started work earlier than , so ProtagonistB was always home earlier than ProtagonistA ProtagonistA came home to ProtagonistB sitting on the couch , watching a sitcom , with our cat Toto , perched on top of ProtagonistB , purring . < nl >  Hello ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said to ProtagonistB , as ProtagonistA sat in the comfort of ProtagonistB's arms ,  How was ProtagonistB's day ?  < nl > That night , ProtagonistA awoke to sounds in the house . ProtagonistA sat up , and woke ProtagonistB . < nl >  Hey ,  ProtagonistA said ,  ProtagonistA think someone broke in .  < nl > Concerned , ProtagonistB got up , and pulled out a bat , a stereotype of a loving husband . After a few minutes ProtagonistB came back with a small shrug .  Must be ProtagonistA's wild imagination .  < nl > ProtagonistA awoke a few hours later , to static . It seemed the whole world was shaking from the aimless sounds . They reverated from the earth beneath , ProtagonistA swear it ! And yet , ProtagonistB slept soundly , unbothered . < nl > That morning , ProtagonistA began to distrust ProtagonistA's vision . ProtagonistA swear from the peripheral of ProtagonistA's vision , ProtagonistA saw things flit by , and ProtagonistA would hear noises from behind that had no foundation in being . < nl > ProtagonistA must be going crazy , ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA . Oh , ProtagonistA will end up in the loony bin . < nl > In the shower , ProtagonistA shaved ProtagonistA's legs smooth , and shampooed ProtagonistA's hair . ProtagonistA am 32 , ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA am in great shape ! If ProtagonistA lose it now and again , and go a little nuts , it 's okay , right ? < nl > As ProtagonistA lined ProtagonistA's eyes , and powdered ProtagonistA's face , ProtagonistA admired ProtagonistA in the mirror . 32 , with the face of a 19 year old . Not a line to mar ProtagonistA's appeal . And how lucky was ProtagonistA , that ProtagonistB still looked like ProtagonistB . We aged well , did n't we ? You could n't even tell . < nl >  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA , can ProtagonistA hear me ?  The voice was clear as a bell , but it was omnipresent , ProtagonistA could not pinpoint where it came from . < nl >  It has been so long , ProtagonistA , I 've missed ProtagonistA ,  The voice was lined with sorrow . < nl >  Hello ,  ProtagonistA called out ,  Who is this ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA's mom , oh , ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA's heart would break .  < nl > The world tipped upside down for a moment , before going back to normal . < nl > ProtagonistA stumbled downstairs to ProtagonistA's coffee . ProtagonistB left ProtagonistB's daily note right next to it ,  Ca n't wait to see ProtagonistA tonight , love dove ,  With a heart , of course . < nl >  Sweetheart .  The voice was ProtagonistB's . But old somehow . Quieter . Sadder . < nl > Static again . Lots of it . ProtagonistA put on earplugs , trying to calm ProtagonistA's mind , but it seemed to sink into the narrowest cracks though ProtagonistA's skull . < nl > ProtagonistA pulled out ProtagonistA's phone and dialed ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was queen of crazy . ProtagonistC would know what to do . < nl >  ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistA said , frantic ,  ProtagonistA do n't know what is going on , ProtagonistA just heard ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistB was older though , ProtagonistA swear . ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistC too !  < nl >  Are ProtagonistA okay , ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC's concerned voice lilted through the phone . < nl > As ProtagonistC was speaking to ProtagonistA through the phone , ProtagonistC's voice again intruded in the room . < nl >  ProtagonistC know it has been so long , this coma has lasted so ... long , but ProtagonistC 've missed ProtagonistA . The doctors say that ,  the voice trailed off into nothingness . < nl >  Did ProtagonistC hear that ,  ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistC , sure that the voice was loud enough to be heard . < nl >  Hear what ?  < nl > Suddenly there was beeping . Steady . Unfailing . Louder , and louder . < nl > ProtagonistA was in a bed suddenly . It was a hospital . So many people ! They all seemed so familiar . But not quite . ProtagonistA spotted ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC looked far older than the last ProtagonistA had seen ProtagonistC . Frightened , ProtagonistA said ,  What 's going on ? Where 's ProtagonistB ,  < nl > ProtagonistB came to ProtagonistA's side . ProtagonistD was with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistD was tall , thin . Why was ProtagonistD's hand in ProtagonistB ? < nl > The doctor cleared the room ,  ProtagonistA has just woken up , ProtagonistA must be in a state of confusion , clear out for a bit , everyone .  < nl > Once alone , ProtagonistA asked the doctor ,  ProtagonistA 've been married to ProtagonistB for ten years . Why is ProtagonistD holding ProtagonistB's hand ?  < nl > The doctor looked confused .  ProtagonistA's information says that ProtagonistA are single . Someone mentioned ProtagonistA were in a relationship before the accident . It has been eleven years ProtagonistA .  < nl > Eleven years . < eos > 
< sos >  Are we heading in the right direction ? I thought the planet was a little more towards the star ?  ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB that morning as they were fast approaching their destination , a pristine blue planet with a few swirls of brown and white on the surface . It had been nearly 10,000 years since they had last come there , but the entire crew remembered placing the primates on the planet all those years ago . < nl >  Yes , ProtagonistB 'm sure this is the right planet . ProtagonistB would n't mistake that blue for anywhere else ,  ProtagonistB responded , pulling up the itinerary the crew had had for the past decade or so on this journey .  It 's the last one on our list .  < nl >  Finally . ProtagonistC 'm getting sick of this assignment . Those silly apes were never going to do much of anything . We should have really stopped the Scientific Consortium from attempting this experiment . The primates would have done just as good on Baby Blue in our solar system ,  ProtagonistC posited .  ProtagonistB , what 's the betting line on this planet ?  < nl >  Of our crew , four say there 's not going to be anything on the planet . ProtagonistC 're the only one left , ProtagonistC .  < nl > ProtagonistC thought about this for a moment . ProtagonistC had taken over the project begrudgingly after the Scientific Consortium had pretty much kicked ProtagonistC out for transgressions in evolution . ProtagonistC had thought this was an ironic assignment , but the Scientific Consortium was known for their fitting punishments . Of the 99 other planets they had tried this experiment on , none had been successful . Perhaps the hundredth time would be the charm .  ProtagonistC 'll go for them still being there ,  ProtagonistC said . ProtagonistC was not confident bit , but ProtagonistC had to have some faith that the Supreme Being would want those apes to get a chance on life . < nl >  Well , we 'll find out in short order ,  ProtagonistA noted as the ship started to come up closer to the blue marble of a planet . < nl > The crew was looking out the main viewpoint as they were orbiting the planet . It was a beautiful blue like Baby Blue , although this place looked greener than any of them had suspected . ProtagonistC was performing an analysis of the planet for what lifeforms were existent on the ground . ProtagonistD was performing similar tasks evaluating for any sounds . They had left communications beacons on the off chance the apes learned how to use them . That had not happened at any of the planets , except for a false alarm on Experiment BB042 . This had led to too much paperwork , so the Scientific Consortium had just sent a larger crew on a Destroyer Ship to eliminate the planet before anything got onto the Public Feed . < nl > In looking at the results , ProtagonistD's mouth was closed tight with ProtagonistD's teeth clenched , shaking ProtagonistD's head in disbelief . Beside ProtagonistD , ProtagonistC was shifting ProtagonistC's weight nervously back and forth . The results were astonishing to say the least . ProtagonistD was hearing the squealing voices from the radio , something called  Fifth Harmony  while ProtagonistC was visualizing what appeared to be biped animals that had become hairless . Considering they had left the planet only 10,000 years ago , there was no way that these could have evolved from other lifeforms on the planet . These had to be the primates . The Scientific Consortium would be ecstatic that this project had finally returned something successful . < nl >  Update ?  ProtagonistA asked from ProtagonistA's chair at the center with ProtagonistE beside ProtagonistA . < nl >  There appear to be few of the original primates we placed on the planet present ,  ProtagonistC began .  Instead , there are other primates that have diverged . They still have quite primitive technologies at their disposal , like this space station orbiting at a near standstill . They have taken over the land quite impressively though , living on all corners even those that are not ideal for their relatively hairless bodies .  < nl >  Their communications are quite rudimentary as well . They utilize the electromagnetic spectrum for some long - range transfers of information . Wires too connect quite a number of things too . They appear to be stagnant in that regard . Fortunately , they have yet to discover the beacon .  < nl >  Okay , thank ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC , ProtagonistC and ProtagonistE will go to the surface in disguise to evaluate on a firsthand basis the planet . You have a day to evaluate . ProtagonistA want regular , hourly reports though . ProtagonistA do not trust what is happening on this planet ,  ProtagonistA remarked cautiously . < nl > --- < nl > ProtagonistB handed ProtagonistC the winnings , three decade 's worth of salary on their ship . This was a meager winning as far as ProtagonistC was concerned given they had been in this ship for the past seven centuries looking for these hundred planets . Now it was time for them to go back to the Scientific Consortium to destroy this planet and the atrocities that had evolved on it . < eos > 
< sos >  ProtagonistA , can ProtagonistA please sit with us ?  < nl > Surprised by the request , ProtagonistA furrowed ProtagonistA's brow and looked over the couch . < nl > ProtagonistA responded hesitantly ,  Sure , ProtagonistA guess ?  < nl > The last time ProtagonistB asked a question like this ProtagonistA found out ProtagonistA's Nanna had past away . ProtagonistA got up slowly from the couch and realized ProtagonistA's mother was also sitting in the kitchen . The five - meter walk felt like an eternity . ProtagonistA's mind was racing . ProtagonistA started to cycle through potential worst - case scenarios . < nl > * They 're going to tell ProtagonistA papaw died . ProtagonistA somehow fucked up at university and have been expelled . * < nl > These thoughts continued to cycle through ProtagonistA's head as ProtagonistA reached the dimly lit kitchen . ProtagonistA sat at the table and ProtagonistA's heart began to pound uncontrollably . ProtagonistA started frantically scanning the room trying to get an insight into what ProtagonistA's parents were about to tell ProtagonistA . The stained yellow wall paper behind ProtagonistA's parents started to make ProtagonistA sicker than normal . The yellow contrast with the dark cabinets always reminded ProtagonistA of a 70 's horror film . < nl > ProtagonistA's parents remained silent . < nl > After the agonizing stillness , ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB am not sure how to break this news , so ProtagonistB am just going to come out and say it . ProtagonistA's mother and ProtagonistB made a mistake . We were under the impression that we allocated ProtagonistA's skill points per what we shared with ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA were thirteen . < nl > Apparently , there was a mix up at the agency , and none of ProtagonistA's points have been allocated .  < nl > ProtagonistA's sun - kissed skin when pale . ProtagonistA's entire facial structure lost integrity and an empty stare replaced ProtagonistA's once concerned look . < nl >  Let ProtagonistA get this straight . There was a ' mistake ' and none of ProtagonistA's skill points have been allocated .  < nl >  Yes , that is correct .  < nl >  Then how am ProtagonistA a functional human being ? ProtagonistA am in the top 1/3 of ProtagonistA's class . ProtagonistA have a high propensity for the sciences and have been accepted into graduate school . ProtagonistA am going to NYU next fall . < nl > The allocation was pretty straight forward to ProtagonistA . < nl > 18/30 < nl > Intelligence > Science > Mathematics < nl > 10/30 < nl > Physical development > Athleticism > Muscular structure < nl > 2/30 < nl > Sociability > empathy and compassion .  < nl > ProtagonistB closed ProtagonistB's eyes and let out a deep sigh . ProtagonistB continued ,  Yes , ProtagonistB know what we thought ProtagonistA were assigned . It seems as though that never happened .  < nl >  So , ProtagonistA have managed to get where ProtagonistA am today with zero allocation of any skill points ?  < nl >  Well , yes .  < nl > ProtagonistA's expression transformed instantly . A small grin started to emerge . < nl >  ProtagonistA have all these skill points that ProtagonistA can still allocate ? ProtagonistA have a clean slate that ProtagonistA can fill as ProtagonistA choose ?  < nl >  Well , technically , we need to do the allocation for ProtagonistA . But , yes , we can choose how ProtagonistA's skill points are distributed . This has never happened , so they are unsure of how this will affect ProtagonistA .  < nl > ProtagonistA's roller coaster of emotions started to become grounded once again . ProtagonistA had trouble comprehending the numerous potential consequences to this revelation . ProtagonistA looked up at ProtagonistA's parents and could tell they were concerned . < nl > ProtagonistA looked down at the table and began to reflect on this crazy evening . < nl > * Fools . They are going to regret ever screwing this up . ProtagonistA 'll present a plan that seems mutually agreed upon . With ProtagonistA's current intelligence , if ProtagonistA can add just 20 points , ProtagonistA can rule this world . * < nl > ProtagonistA looked up with a disarming smile and said ,  Mom . Dad . Its ok . ProtagonistA am not upset . Like you said , this is unfortunate , but we can sit down to formulate the best way to allocate ProtagonistA's points .  < nl > ProtagonistA's parents looked immediately relieved . < nl > ProtagonistA's mother finally joined the conversation ,  We are so glad to hear ProtagonistA say that . Now we can make ProtagonistA even lovelier .  < nl > ProtagonistA smiled back , but the lack of empathy in ProtagonistA's eyes caused a shiver to run down ProtagonistB's neck . < nl > # # # Part 2 in the comments # # # < eos > 
< sos >  You know , ProtagonistA , it is common in times of deep distress to confabulate - to replace the actual reality with one that is more palatable to the mind . And I understand why it would be comforting to think of ProtagonistA as sane --  < nl >  -- ProtagonistA am sane ! That 's what I 'm trying   --  < nl > I frowned , absently scratching my wrist .  -- but nonetheless , it is * important * , a necessary step , for ProtagonistA to * accept * the truth . Otherwise , you ca n't move on to the next step ... the healing . And that 's why we 're here . To heal ProtagonistA .  < nl > ProtagonistA stared at me , ProtagonistA's body quivering with repressed emotion . < nl >  Doctor Anderson , ProtagonistA --  < nl >  -- Doctor Anderson was ProtagonistA's father , ProtagonistA . Please , call ProtagonistA ProtagonistA .  < nl >  * ProtagonistA * , ProtagonistA just want ProtagonistA to think ... what if our situations were reversed ? What would ProtagonistA do ? Every part of ProtagonistA's being is sure - it * knows * - that ProtagonistA do not belong here . ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's own office , for Christ 's sake !  < nl > I feel my lips pull back into a taut smile .  Now , ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA 're getting agitated . Let 's take a deep breath for a moment . Normally , it 's not healthy for us to let our patients perseverate on delusions but I am guessing that it will calm ProtagonistA down if ProtagonistA feel like ProtagonistA have gotten to tell ' ProtagonistA's story , '  I paused to wiggle my index and middle fingers up and down in the air ,  and that reminding ProtagonistA that it is just that - ProtagonistA's * story * - might not be helpful at this moment . So let 's make a compromise . I will listen to ProtagonistA , let ProtagonistA try to convince me . I promise that I will take it upon myself to follow - up on information ProtagonistA give me . But ProtagonistA need to do something in exchange . ProtagonistA's previous doctor wrote up a comprehensive treatment plan , and from all accounts , ProtagonistA have been fighting it tooth and nail --  < nl > ProtagonistA leapt out of the plastic chair , ProtagonistA's slippered feet landing on the dirty tile of the floor .  -- which is * exactly * what someone who --  < nl > The smile left my face . I cleared my throat and watched ProtagonistA silently . I saw the hospital gown move with ProtagonistA's body as ProtagonistA inhaled deeply . ProtagonistA's pale blue eyes focused on the floor as ProtagonistA slowly sat back down . < nl > My lips pulled back again as I watched ProtagonistA .  From what I read in ProtagonistA's file , restraining ProtagonistA is a major step forward for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA . I congratulate ProtagonistA .  < nl > ProtagonistA mumbled something that I assumed was  thank you .  I paused to see if ProtagonistA was going to continue ProtagonistA's interruption , but ProtagonistA remained silent . < nl > I gave a light chuckle .  * As * I was saying ... we will need to work out an agreement . I do something for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA do something for me .  < nl > This time , ProtagonistA's inhalation was accompanied by a full - body shudder , as if ProtagonistA's petite , athletic frame was trying as hard as ProtagonistA's brain to adjust to the idea . < nl >  Good !  I felt genuine happiness to see that I was already making progress with ProtagonistA - the first happiness I had felt in quite some time . I had , of course , been extremely nervous coming in this morning , unsure what to expect of the new situation . I certainly had not imagined that things would be going this well when the day began . < nl > I pushed back up the sleeves of my white coat , making a mental note that I should exchange it for one that fit me better . I opened my notebook and gave my pen a jaunty click , then turned my attention back to ProtagonistA , studying ProtagonistA .  Please - go ahead .  < nl > ProtagonistA gave a brief nod , a lock of chestnut hair coming down in front of ProtagonistA's face before ProtagonistA's trembling hand tucked it back behind ProtagonistA's ear .  ProtagonistA 'll do ProtagonistA's best to remain objective and give you verifiable information . ProtagonistA 've been working as a behavioral aide here for three weeks . ProtagonistA live at 542 Spring St. , Apt 204 , with ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA also see ProtagonistB , about once or twice a week . You can call ProtagonistB at 973 - 619 - 6464 . ProtagonistA imagine they 've destroyed or hidden ProtagonistA's file but you can also check with the payroll company about the fact that ProtagonistA have direct deposit set up .  < nl > I made some notes in my notebook , then looked up at ProtagonistA .  Social ?  < nl > ProtagonistA's head tilted to one side .  Hmm ?  < nl > I studied the topography of ProtagonistA's face , the coquettish folds of ProtagonistA's ear .  ProtagonistA's social . Or the last 4 , anyway . I doubt I 'll get very far without it .  < nl > I loved seeing how joy sparked in ProtagonistA's eyes at that . Those eyes .  Oh ! Of course ! 5820 . Doctor An - * Ben * , thank you so much . You do n't know ...  The tremor that had entered ProtagonistA's voice began spreading through ProtagonistA's whole body . ProtagonistA made no attempt to wipe away ProtagonistA's tears when ProtagonistA looked up at me . I imagined they were snails sliding down ProtagonistA's pale cheeks , searching for a dark hole in which to hide . < nl >  Do n't mention it . But ProtagonistA 'm afraid we have to leave it there for today - ProtagonistA ca n't go getting behind on ProtagonistA's first day !  I laughed - laughed like I have n't in quite some time .  But first ... !  < nl > I held up a Dixie cup with a rainbow assortment of pills in it and gave it a little shake .  I can tell ProtagonistA with confidence that these drugs all have a relatively short half - life , so if I discover ProtagonistA's story is true --  < nl >  -- * when * --  ProtagonistA corrected . < nl >  -- it will be easy enough to wean ProtagonistA off them .  < nl > ProtagonistA's delicate fingers , trembling , reached for the cup . I studied ProtagonistA's fingers as I felt ProtagonistA's skin brush mine briefly . I thought of bird bones . Songbirds . Tiny , fragile - must be careful not to break them . < nl > Satisfied that ProtagonistA had taken ProtagonistA's medicine , I gave ProtagonistA what I imagined was a professional nod , then walked out of the room . I marveled at how different it felt to walk on the floor while wearing shoes . < nl > I got to what they told me had been ProtagonistA's office when I arrived . I still could not believe the day I was having . Transferred from Weehawken that morning , and then , during processing - to be told ... to realize ! < nl > ProtagonistA's previous  doctor  had been an imbecile , of course . A tapeworm . Squish . That was the sound his brains had made . < nl > I opened my notebook , placed it on * ProtagonistA * desk , taking a moment to simply savor the irony of it all . Then I reviewed my notes : < nl > * 542 Spring St. Apt . 204 . Kill ProtagonistC . < nl > * 973 - 619 - 6464 . Mara . * * Must * * meet her . < nl > * Social 5820 . Bank ? ? ? < nl > I frowned down at the page . Stealing ProtagonistA's money hardly seemed worth the time when there was so much more I could play with . I could think about it for later , I suppose . < nl > I wrote something at the top of the page before I closed the notebook : < nl > * Yet he who reigns within himself , and rules * < nl > * Passions , desires , and fears , is more a king . * < nl > I leaned back in ProtagonistA's chair . I could smell ProtagonistA - ProtagonistA's essence , intermingled with the fabric . < nl > Sheer , exultant joy . What a day . And many , many more to come . < eos > 
< sos > Call it a rush . Meeting new people . Appraising them . The catalogue of my mind is full from charming first dates , and it 's ever growing fuller . I ca n't cram just anyone in there < nl > But this one seems worth it . < nl > ProtagonistA met me at Aux Trois Capitaines . Good setting . ProtagonistA 's charmed , I 'm charming . Instant spark . < nl > We hit it off , instantly . < nl > I 've been doing this a while . I have met many people . For me , the gender matters less than the person : who they are , what they have done . But ProtagonistA is one of the most interesting . < nl > ProtagonistA's hobby is mountain climbing . ProtagonistA is a polyglot dabbling in nearly ten languages . In school ProtagonistA studied organic chemistry , a skill whose usefulness I ca n't think of now , but it is rare in such a pleasant person . ProtagonistA has seen < nl > The champagne bubbles like the blood in my brain . I watch ProtagonistA's smooth pale arms move and wonder at seeing the Balkans through ProtagonistA's eyes . Or how the world looked from the top of Kilimanjaro as ProtagonistA stood there , gasping and humbled by the vastness of the world . < nl > I love ProtagonistA . I crave ProtagonistA . < nl > That 's the best part . The exhilarating part . It is what brings me back to some bar or restaurant somewhere , anywhere , over and over again . As long as I can feel that spark . That forward tug of compulsion that cries , * I need ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's everything . * < nl > I offer to walk ProtagonistA to the train station . ProtagonistA seems relieved , tipsy and delighted . We walk holding hands . ProtagonistA is wobbly in ProtagonistA's heels . < nl > I draw ProtagonistA down an alley , promising a shortcut . The look ProtagonistA gives me is halting , hesitant . < nl >  C'm on ,  I say .  I grew up here . I know what I 'm doing it .  < nl > That or the alcohol in ProtagonistA's brain convinces ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA follows me into the dim , giggling stupidly about muggers in America . < nl > My belly rises in delight . I can hear nothing beyond my own blood roaring in my ears . < nl > Call it a rush . In that final second ProtagonistA can hear the both of us , our thoughts and selves inextricably wound together thenceforth . ProtagonistA's life changed , irreversibly , and become mine . < nl > I reach for ProtagonistA's face as if to kiss ProtagonistA . When ProtagonistA relents to me I grab ProtagonistA by ProtagonistA's skull and slam ProtagonistA's head into the wall . ProtagonistA makes a stunned sparrow cry and looks at me in horror . < nl > Just before ProtagonistA dies , I think how lovely ProtagonistA's fear looks . ProtagonistA realizes with animal panic that ProtagonistA does n't want to die . < nl > And then I open ProtagonistA's skull against the stone . ProtagonistA slumps bonelessly down , leaving behind a splatter of blond hair and brain like spaghetti on the brick wall . < nl > It was unbefitting , to ruin someone as lovely as ProtagonistA . But I just could n't wait another moment to get ProtagonistA inside of me . < nl >  * ProtagonistA * ,  I say . Goodbye , and thank ProtagonistA . < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA crumpled the note in ProtagonistA's hand . The all - too - familiar tremble returned to ProtagonistA's spine , spreading down ProtagonistA's arms , raising the tiny hairs in its wake . < nl > > This could have been us . < nl > The phrase echoed through ProtagonistA's mind . Over the years , ProtagonistA had grown used to the squiggly handwriting and the cooked meals . ProtagonistA never ate them or slept in the made bed . The first few times , ProtagonistA 'd called the cops , which of course did nothing . < nl > ' No evidence of foul play , ProtagonistA , ' the officer had said , ' but we 'll keep a car in the area . ' < nl > ProtagonistA reached for the knife , still on the cutting board sprinkled with chives residue , still warm in ProtagonistA's cold hand . ProtagonistB was here . ProtagonistA tried listening for sounds , but all ProtagonistA heard was the drumroll of ProtagonistA's heart . < nl > Slowly , ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way over to ProtagonistA's bag and fished out ProtagonistA's phone . ProtagonistA had done this a hundred times before . < nl >  ProtagonistB 's here ,  ProtagonistA breathed into the phone . < nl > * * * < nl >  Hey , what do ProtagonistD make of this one ?  ProtagonistC said , waving the newspaper .  ProtagonistA was found dead in ProtagonistA's bed last night .  < nl > ProtagonistC's gray hair bounced off ProtagonistC's shoulders as ProtagonistC made it over to the couch . ProtagonistD stared disinterestedly at the TV screen . Years of cheeseburger and beer abuse had taken its toll on ProtagonistC's body , and ProtagonistC's stained wife beater struggled to contain ProtagonistC's bloated belly . < nl >  That does have a certain air of * I - don't - give - two - shits * to it ,  ProtagonistC grumbled .  Besides , we 're too old for this , ProtagonistD .  < nl >  But imagine being stalked for thirteen years ,  ProtagonistC said , adjusting ProtagonistC's glasses .  That 's worse than-  < nl >  Worse than what ? Going to Hell ? Making buddies with Lucifer ? Getting smacked around by a bunch of monster - under - your - bed types for a career ?  ProtagonistC's face turned red as ProtagonistC spoke .  We 're retired now . Let someone else handle it .  < nl >  Nobody did for thirteen years . Everyone probably thought ProtagonistA was crazy . Imagine living like that ...  < nl > ProtagonistC mumbled something unintelligible and turned up the volume on the TV . ProtagonistC shook ProtagonistC's head and limped toward the door . ProtagonistC knew now why ProtagonistD never watched the news or read the paper - something strange was bound to come up eventually . < nl > ProtagonistC's cane tapped against the marble stairs . It was n't ProtagonistC's responsibility , and ProtagonistA was already dead . But for some reason , this bothered ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC had to get to the bottom of it . < nl > * * * < nl > ProtagonistE glanced suspiciously at ProtagonistF . ProtagonistE pushed ProtagonistE's walker forward , feeling the cramps bite into ProtagonistE's legs and back . Usually , ProtagonistE did n't put ProtagonistE's nose in other people 's business , but the pressed suit and wavy silver hair did n't sit right with ProtagonistE - men of ProtagonistF's age usually wore sweatpants and plaid vests , and were bald . < nl >  Excuse ProtagonistE ,  ProtagonistE said , ProtagonistE's voice creaking .  Who are ProtagonistF ?  < nl >  ProtagonistF 'm special agent Booth with the FBI .  ProtagonistF leaned heavily on ProtagonistF's cane , squinting ProtagonistF's eyes . < nl >  No , ProtagonistF 're not ,  ProtagonistE said curtly .  ProtagonistF 're almost ProtagonistE's age , and ProtagonistE do n't remember anyone like ProtagonistF there .  < nl >  Ah , ProtagonistE got ProtagonistF . ProtagonistF 'm Sam Winchester , ProtagonistE .  < nl >  Let ProtagonistE guess ; ProtagonistF 're here about ProtagonistA . ProtagonistE 'm Dana Scully , actually with the FBI ... well , until ProtagonistE retired , at least .  < nl > ProtagonistF looked ProtagonistE up and down , the wrinkles on ProtagonistF's forehead growing deeper and darker .  It 's weird , though , is n't it ?  < nl >  What 's weird , exactly ?  < nl >  That ProtagonistA did n't get help for thirteen years , and never managed to identify ProtagonistA's stalker . This is going to sound strange and possibly incriminating , but ProtagonistF feel guilty .  < nl > ProtagonistE nodded . ProtagonistE felt exactly the same . That 's why ProtagonistE abandoned ProtagonistE's beloved flower garden and took the train down here . ProtagonistE had even called ProtagonistG , but ProtagonistG's dementia was starting to get the best of ProtagonistG these days . < nl >  ProtagonistE get the feeling ProtagonistF 've worked on cases like this before ?  ProtagonistE finally said . < nl >  ProtagonistF have a few under ProtagonistF's belt .  ProtagonistF chuckled , and then started coughing .  Sorry , yeah , but it 's been a while .  < nl > ProtagonistE was n't exactly sure why , but there was something in ProtagonistF's eyes that was inherently good . The urgency in ProtagonistF's voice told ProtagonistE that ProtagonistF wanted to put this right - as right as it could be . And once again , ProtagonistE felt the same way . < nl >  Okay , let 's see if we can get into the morgue somehow .  ProtagonistE turned ProtagonistE's walker around . < nl > ProtagonistF nodded , and a smile cracked ProtagonistF's chapped lips .  ProtagonistF think ProtagonistF have an idea .  < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA comes to the Wal - mart , alone , on a windy evening .   The door to the box - store separates for ProtagonistA automatically when it senses ProtagonistA's human movements , and ProtagonistA shivers in the vestibule .   ProtagonistA is very tired , but still ProtagonistA smiles and nods when ProtagonistB says hello , grinning with ProtagonistB's strange teeth .   ProtagonistA pulls a shopping cart free , and goes shuffling down the aisles , each full of every commodity imaginable , all stacked atop each other like the towers of some cliffside gothic castle . < nl > ProtagonistA only has twenty dollars cash remaining in ProtagonistA's coat pocket .   It was given to ProtagonistA by Sandra from the community center , who had just that afternoon also invited ProtagonistA to live in ProtagonistC's house , now that ProtagonistA's mother had at last kicked ProtagonistA out for good .   Whether the money was a loan or gift is still not altogether clear to ProtagonistA .   However , the distinction does not matter .   Deep down ProtagonistA knows ProtagonistA does not intend to ever repay it . < nl >  ProtagonistC's spare room is n't much bigger than a closet , but this is to help ProtagonistA make it feel like it 's ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistC had announced , when ProtagonistC pressed the crumpled bills into ProtagonistA's hand ,  Get ProtagonistA a new little dresser , some sheets , and whatever else it will take .   ProtagonistC 'll help ProtagonistA set it up tonight after work .  < nl > ProtagonistC's kindness had initially measured over two hundred dollars .   Alongside the spare room , it was all such a gesture that ProtagonistA quickly realized ProtagonistA had no concept of how to respond , so ProtagonistA just stuttered a thank you , and then hugged ProtagonistC for over five seconds .   ProtagonistA told ProtagonistC that ProtagonistC had already become a second mother to ProtagonistA , who , unlike ProtagonistA's real mom , understood addiction , and how when people stumble , they need compassion and support , rather than an eviction , and an oath to no longer enable . ProtagonistA promised not to waste the opportunity ProtagonistC had given ProtagonistA .   But even though ProtagonistA believed at the time that ProtagonistA had meant what ProtagonistA promised , before ProtagonistA was even a mile from the community center , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA detouring on ProtagonistA's way to the Wal - mart , over to the park where the men in the puffy jackets are always sitting on the same bench .   Soon enough , almost all ProtagonistC's money was gone .   And now , meandering through the endless Wal - mart aisles , stuffed full everything a human being could ever covet , ProtagonistA encounters the sheets and the small dressers , and the prices on them .   ProtagonistA begins to cry . < nl >  Are ProtagonistA alright , ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistB asks , mincing toward ProtagonistA .   ProtagonistB is very old and ProtagonistB's skin is quite pale , even under the fluorescent Wal - mart lights .   Usually ProtagonistA would lie to ProtagonistD and send ProtagonistD along after being asked this sort of question .   But , with ProtagonistB , for some reason ProtagonistA does want to dismiss ProtagonistB so summarily .   Perhaps it is the lilt in ProtagonistB's voice or perhaps it is just the frantic desperation of ProtagonistA's situation ; regardless , ProtagonistA feels compelled to tell ProtagonistB an intimate truth . < nl >  ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA just ruined the last chance ProtagonistA had at a decent life ,  ProtagonistA says , wiping ProtagonistA's nose on ProtagonistA's sleeve ,  All because ProtagonistA ca n't control ProtagonistA .   All because ProtagonistA 'm a fucking vampire who just ca n't stop consuming and hurting people .  < nl > ProtagonistA goes on to unburden ProtagonistA to ProtagonistB , as if ProtagonistB was a priest , with the kitchenware aisle for his confessional .   ProtagonistA tells ProtagonistB about the drugs , how it began with the cooks and other waitresses all reeking of garlic after too - long shifts in the restaurant , how it migrated to parties on the weekends , and then to alleyways and abandoned buildings , how ProtagonistA's mother would inspect ProtagonistA's forearms with a flashlight and lock up ProtagonistA's purse at night , how ProtagonistA went to the meetings , but spent most of it on ProtagonistA's cell phone , until it was ProtagonistA's turn to speak , when ProtagonistA would stand before the crowd and just lie .   ProtagonistA tells ProtagonistB about Sandra , and how ProtagonistA does n't even know what ProtagonistA is doing in the fucking Wal - mart since ProtagonistA has no money left and will never again be able to look that saintly woman in the eyes . < nl >  Well , if ProtagonistA 're a vampire , then ProtagonistB 'd say ProtagonistA 're in the right place ,  ProtagonistB tells ProtagonistA , stroking ProtagonistA back gently ,  Everyone in Wal - mart is a vampire in one way or another , just insatiably consuming all this garbage .   But , you know , maybe being a vampire is the highest , best thing anyone can be these days .   So maybe ProtagonistA should just stop fighting against what ProtagonistA really are .  < nl > ProtagonistA chuckles a little .   ProtagonistB is more pragmatic than ProtagonistA would have expected .  That 's all well and good , but it wo n't exactly help ProtagonistA find a place to sleep tonight , now will it ?  ProtagonistA asks . < nl >  Oh ProtagonistB do n't know about that ,  ProtagonistB responds ,  ProtagonistB think if ProtagonistA really wanted to , ProtagonistA could still find a way to lay ProtagonistA's head at ProtagonistC's place , and ProtagonistB think ProtagonistA could do it without having to ever admit ProtagonistA's little slip up to ProtagonistC .   Tell ProtagonistB , do ProtagonistA think ProtagonistC has a welcome mat outside ProtagonistC's house ?   If not , this Wal - mart 's got a lovely selection of welcome mats , and plenty of them are cheaper than twenty bucks .   Maybe all it will take for ProtagonistA to get ProtagonistA into ProtagonistC's house tonight is laying down a welcome mat beside ProtagonistC's door .  < nl > ProtagonistA looks at ProtagonistB with a furrowed brow .    Okay now ProtagonistB 're not making any sense , what does a welcome mat have to -  < nl > ProtagonistB puts ProtagonistB's wrinkled , liver spotted finger on ProtagonistA's lips .   ProtagonistB leans in and whispers in ProtagonistA's ear .   ProtagonistA's eyes go wide . < eos > 
< sos > as we sat there , some already glazed over from their heroin class earlier , ProtagonistC was going over the correct way of injecting with a syringe . ProtagonistA was bored out of ProtagonistA's mind . * why does every class feel the need to go over the basics , ProtagonistA got it after the first three classes went over the same thing * ProtagonistA was just glad ProtagonistA 'd had ProtagonistA's daily smoke of marijuana before class otherwise ProtagonistA would be getting antsy by now . < nl >  psst  < nl > ProtagonistA turned towards the sound to see ProtagonistB leaning over from ProtagonistB's seat and pulled this weird looking box with a screen and buttons on it from the inside of ProtagonistB's jacket . < nl >  what is that ?  < nl >  it 's a calculator , hey , Do you wanna try some math ?  < nl >  what 's math ?  < nl >  it 's really neat , you calculate numbers and equations and stuff like that . ProtagonistB's dad taught ProtagonistB .  < nl > ProtagonistA was trying to figure out what ProtagonistB was talking about when ProtagonistC noticed the calculator . ProtagonistC stopped what ProtagonistC was doing and practically zoomed to ProtagonistB's side . < nl >  what are ProtagonistB doing with that ? !  ProtagonistC whispered in a panic  do n't ProtagonistB know what the government will do if they find out ProtagonistB know how to do mathematics ? !  < nl > Just then a shrill sound started coming from the camera in the corner and school security was in the room almost instantly . They grabbed ProtagonistB making sure that the calculator was out of sight from the rest of the class before dragging ProtagonistB out the door . < nl > ProtagonistC turned to the class and said  ProtagonistC 'll be right back , in the meanwhile practice what ProtagonistC taught you .  and ProtagonistC left the room following after the guards . < nl > As ProtagonistA pulled out the practice syringe ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA * ProtagonistA hope ProtagonistC 's not going to be in too much trouble , ProtagonistC was kinda cute * < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA stared at ProtagonistC , ProtagonistA's eyes wide .    That 's ... that 's ...  ProtagonistA's voice trailed off . ProtagonistA frowned , then leaned sideways , to call out down one of the quarters corridors leading off the crew 's mess . < nl >  ProtagonistB ! HEY ! JOHNSON !  < nl > ProtagonistB , poked ProtagonistB's head into view from ProtagonistB's bunk , where ProtagonistB had been ensconced with an electronic reader .    Someone call ?  < nl >  Is it true that humans used to put themselves in metal boxes and launch themselves off ...  ProtagonistA foundered for a moment , clearly forgetting the name of the planet in question , before rallying .  Off your planet with liquid fuel cannisters ?  < nl > ProtagonistB frowned , ProtagonistB's small dark human nose wrinkling .  What do ProtagonistA mean , * used * to ?  < nl > It took ProtagonistC a moment to process that .    ProtagonistB mean they still do it ?  ProtagonistC asked , horror dawning . < nl >  Some people . Most of us use grav engines like the rest , but one of ProtagonistB's old neighbours was in the Vintage Rocket Ship Society .   And that 's not even getting into the weirdos that still fly the old sub atmospheric craft ....  ProtagonistB stopped for a moment , snapping ProtagonistB's fingers in an odd way that ProtagonistC had learned signalled that ProtagonistB was trying to remember something .  Airplanes . Yeah , some people are crazy enough to still drive those combustible fuel craft through our ATMOSPHERE .  < nl > There was a collective gasp .   By then , most of the crew in the mess were listening in . < nl >  Have ProtagonistB tried it ?  ProtagonistA asked curiously . < nl > ProtagonistB snorted .  Hell no . Why do ProtagonistA think ProtagonistB signed up on the first trade ship that would take ProtagonistB ? ProtagonistB 'm not sticking around for that nonsense .  < nl > edit : forgot an important word . < eos > 
< sos > Then ProtagonistA went to the bakery , followed annoyingly by ProtagonistB . The little bell above the door gave a soft tingle to announce ProtagonistA's arrival . The baker and his wife looked up and smiled a hello . ProtagonistA politely read ProtagonistA's list of required baked goods . While the baker gathered the required ingredients , his wife and ProtagonistA had a riveting conversation about the price of wheat in relation to the season . < nl > Unfortunately , this session of pleasantries was cut short by ProtagonistB's irksome cries to get to cover . ProtagonistB had selfishly tagged along with ProtagonistA on ProtagonistA's errands , risking ProtagonistA's safety and sanity . ProtagonistB's flamboyant hair was surpassed in gaudiness only by ProtagonistB's personality . With no regard for the damage being done to the humble bakers ' livelihood , ProtagonistB haphazardly threw magic orbs at the rogue spirits who killed ProtagonistB's family ( a morbid story ProtagonistB told everyone ProtagonistB came in contact with ) . < nl > ProtagonistA , sensibly , hid behind the counter with the bakers , attempting to reassure them during such a frightening , yet easily avoidable , situation . ProtagonistA even spared Tess , however undeserving , from blame . With an incredibly pompous flourish , ProtagonistB banished the last of the spirits back to their realm . ProtagonistB unapologetically walked over to where the three innocent bystanders ProtagonistB had just placed in harms way were seeking refuge . < nl > ProtagonistA , attempting to placate ProtagonistB's massive savior complex , thanked ProtagonistB for ProtagonistB's help ( even though ProtagonistB had caused the problem ) . The bakers even played along , most likely scared to death by such an abomination of nature . ProtagonistA , thanked the couple and volunteered to help them fix the damaged property first thing in the morning . ProtagonistA even invited ProtagonistB to the dinner for whom the now unobtainable breads were intended . < nl > ProtagonistB unfortunately accepted . < eos > 
< sos > It was big diesel - guzzling take - no - prisoners beast of a vehicle . Amphibious , bullet - proof , noisy as an earthquake and converted from some leftover war materiel that was so hot that with five spare minutes and some film you could take x - rays . Had plenty of space in the back for the things ProtagonistA needed to carry . Up front , plenty of room for ProtagonistA ; everything that had happened left ProtagonistA feeling so upset that the pounds practically fell off . ProtagonistA called it SLEIGH II . < nl > The radiation did n't matter to ProtagonistA , but it did a number on ProtagonistA's reindeer so they were holed up for the duration . Missing Christmas 2037 was bad enough : there had been a NORAD radar on ProtagonistA for real and ProtagonistA's old sleigh took a point - blank hit from a 35 kiloton anti - ballistic interceptor . ProtagonistA had to think quickly in those few milliseconds so ProtagonistA spent ProtagonistA's magic on making sure ProtagonistA and ProtagonistA's faithful reindeer survived the explosion and the fall down , down , down , towards a land full of bright and terrible lights with a thousand deadly Christmas stars overhead showing the way to Hell . < nl > ProtagonistA had had that old sleigh for ... forever , really . Same for ProtagonistA's famous red toy sack . Watching them flash out of existence was heartbreaking . But it gave ProtagonistA something in common with the humans . ProtagonistA lost nearly everything , they lost everything . The only ones that were left were locked down in their shelters , pockets of dozens here and there dug into the sides of mountains and into old mines . There was n't anyone left watching the sky . Instead they watched Geiger counters and clocks and calendars , marking off a century a day at a time . < nl > So why fly ? There was n't anyone around ProtagonistA was trying to hide from . Green military pants , red shirt , black boots , and Mrs. Claus made some green suspenders . ProtagonistA wore a tight fitting cap with ProtagonistA's old white fur puffball stitched right to the top , instead of flopping around like the old days . Leather gloves kept ProtagonistA's hands comfortable on the wheel of SLEIGH II and ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way overland . < nl > * * * < nl > Tucked away in their beds were the dozen or so families of * Community Shelter 8 . * The air had its characteristic twang , the smell of the filters and that weird burned smell that came through from the outside feed pipe . A construction paper christmas tree flapped against the wall in the common room , caught in the draft of the air recycler . < nl > Christmas Eve ! A whole year since they went down into their hole and they had celebrated survival in their meager way . < nl > ProtagonistB would mark a year since the world above went silent . Everyone planned on sleeping in , and there were no formal activities planned . ProtagonistB used to be a birthday , Christmas , celebrating hope and family . Now ProtagonistB was a death - day . < nl > The paper Christmas tree breezed this way , went still , and then breezed that way . < nl > If anyone was looking , they would have seen ProtagonistC . They would have seen ProtagonistC reach into ProtagonistC's pocket and throw a handful of shiny dust into the air , and they would have seen ProtagonistC climb into a huge armored vehicle and wink away at an impossible speed towards the northwest , in fact towards the * Oak Creek Village Fallout Shelter . * < nl > * * * < nl > ProtagonistD and ProtagonistE had the early shift this morning . No one else was up . < nl > ProtagonistD poured ProtagonistD coffee from the pot in the common room , as usual . ProtagonistD had n't run into ProtagonistE yet , but ProtagonistE would be in the control room checking the outside instruments , routine stuff . < nl > The movement of the paper on the wall caught ProtagonistD's eye . ProtagonistD sighed . ProtagonistD was thankful that life in the shelter was boring , mostly free of drama . ProtagonistD had played a game as a kid built around the life ProtagonistD was living now - things could be so much worse . < nl > But what kind of future would ProtagonistD's children have ? Everyone decided that there would n't be gifts , just some extra rations with the menu heavy on the sweets . Had to keep things fair , the shelter had the things they * needed * and did n't make provision for something as frivolous as ProtagonistB gifts . < nl > A package . About as big as a filter module . Wrapped in beautiful paper and tied with a silver and green bow , and a tag tied to the knot . It had n't been there during the celebration the night before . < nl > Had someone been holding on to this for a whole year ? ProtagonistD smiled as ProtagonistD went over to pick it up , and it was a little heavy for its size . ProtagonistD wanted to show it to ProtagonistE , so ProtagonistD made ProtagonistD's way to the control room . < nl >  Knock knock ,  ProtagonistD said .  You 're not going to believe it .  < nl >  You know ?  ProtagonistE asked . < nl >  About the present ?  < nl >  What ?  ProtagonistE was busier on the instruments that ProtagonistE usually was . < nl >  Hold on ,  ProtagonistD set the gift down ,  what are ProtagonistE talking about ?  < nl >  Look , look through the periscope .  < nl > ProtagonistD looked . It was snowing outside . It made ProtagonistD's stomach sick . The last time ProtagonistD saw snow , it was made of ash , of buildings and things and animals and people . A whole year . * A whole year * , ProtagonistD thought , * and someone pressed the button again . * < nl >  God , no ...  ProtagonistD whispered .  How hot is it ?  ProtagonistD asked ProtagonistE . < nl >  It 's not .  < nl > ProtagonistD's eyes went to the geiger counter . And it read : < nl > * * 000 * * < nl >  The meter 's broken ,  ProtagonistD reasoned . < nl >  It 's not ,  ProtagonistE replied .  ProtagonistE just finished double - checking with the test source . Meter works . That 's real snow and there 's no radiation outside .  They sat together quiet for a few seconds .  ProtagonistD were saying something when ProtagonistD came in ,  ProtagonistE said . < nl > ProtagonistD looked at the present , wrapped up and pretty .  ProtagonistD was going to ask ProtagonistE if ProtagonistE knew where that came from .  < nl > ProtagonistE looked confused .  What 's going * on * ?  ProtagonistE pointed at the tag .  What 's the tag say ?  < nl > FROM : SANTA < nl > TO : COMMUNITY SHELTER 8 < nl > MERRY CHRISTMAS - 2038 < nl >  ProtagonistD 'm going to open it .  ProtagonistD's fingers sunk into the paper tearing it , before ProtagonistE could suggest something else . < nl > It was a simple cardboard box underneath , and the lid slid neatly off . < nl > Corn seeds . Wheat seeds . Peas . Pepper seeds . Apple and cherry seeds . Avocado pits . A few whole potatoes . There were more and more . < nl > And a note : * For New Life * < nl > * * * < nl > I collect my stories at /r / wpforme < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA removed ProtagonistA's helmet and threw it into ProtagonistA's armor rack , sending the pristine ceremonial garb tumbling into the dirt , before collapsing into ProtagonistA's chair . ProtagonistA was seething with rage , the sound of constant rainfall grating and infuriating . If only ProtagonistC had just- < nl >  ProtagonistA ,  The flaps of ProtagonistA's holotent opened slightly to reveal ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistD requests ProtagonistA's presence in the command tent .  ProtagonistB paused and looked at ProtagonistA nervously  Presently .  < nl > ProtagonistA picked up a jug of wine and sent it flying in ProtagonistB's direction , prompting ProtagonistB's expedient removal from ProtagonistA's general vicinity . Tightly gripping the bridge of ProtagonistA's nose in a futile effort to calm down , ProtagonistA sighed heavily . Of course ProtagonistC wanted to see ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC never shirked away from an opportunity to criticise ProtagonistC's betters . ProtagonistC would relish the opportunity to place the blame at ProtagonistA's feet for this , of that ProtagonistA was certain . < nl > Ignoring ProtagonistA's helmet ProtagonistA threw open the flaps of ProtagonistA's holotent prompting an aquilan salute from any nearby legionaries . ProtagonistA left them to their dice games in the mud without so much as a glance , electro sandals propelling ProtagonistA past the remainder of ProtagonistA's cohort and sent ProtagonistA storming into the command tent . < nl >  ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistA growled before the soundproof flaps had even closed behind ProtagonistA , gripping ProtagonistD by the cape strap .  What happened to our god damn air support , we were sitting ducks out there .  < nl > ProtagonistD just smiled back smugly , making no effort to wriggle out of ProtagonistA's grip .  How has the role of Primus been treating ProtagonistA ProtagonistA ? It must be tough , filling shoes as large as ProtagonistD ,  ProtagonistD scoffed  Especially with operations like this one on ProtagonistA's resume .  < nl >  You little-  ProtagonistA raised ProtagonistA's hand to strike ProtagonistD before ProtagonistA was interrupted . < nl >  Enough !  A loud voice echoed through the large tent , stopping ProtagonistA dead in ProtagonistA's tracks .  This useless squabble has no place within these walls .  < nl >  ProtagonistE ?  ProtagonistA asked breathlessly , before swiftly releasing ProtagonistD and turning to give ProtagonistE a proper aquilan salute .  Forgive ProtagonistA ProtagonistE , had ProtagonistA been made aware of ProtagonistE's presence I-  < nl >  ProtagonistA would have dropped this charade and spoken ProtagonistA's mind freely ?  ProtagonistE said , looking up at ProtagonistA from the ever - changing battle map laid out on the table .  Then ProtagonistE implore ProtagonistA to keep ProtagonistE's presence in mind until further notice .  < nl > ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's mouth to speak but quickly thought better of it , as ProtagonistD stood in silent salute .  Understood , ProtagonistE .  < nl > ProtagonistE was not the most people prone commander ProtagonistA had ever served under , but ProtagonistE's tactical brilliance was undeniable . ProtagonistE had put the 262nd legion on the map , and under ProtagonistE's command , it had known many storied triumphs . Today , however , was not one of them . < nl >  The Air support ,  ProtagonistE grumbled at them , eyes fixed on the previous battle playing out in front of ProtagonistE .  They were relieved of ProtagonistE's command not but 5 hours ago .  < nl > They stood in shock , waiting for an explanation that never came . Eventually , ProtagonistA caved . < nl >  ProtagonistE , with respect ,  ProtagonistA started < nl >  ProtagonistF has demanded additional support for ProtagonistF's campaign on Varinia IV ,  ProtagonistE scratched the back of ProtagonistE's head ,  Hence the loss of the bulk of our atmospheric strike craft and troop delivery vehicles .  < nl >  So we are to abandon the planet then ?  ProtagonistD asked , at which point ProtagonistE looked up to stare at ProtagonistD sternly .  ProtagonistE ?  < nl >  No , we are to proceed with the offensive until further notice ,  < nl >  But without-  ProtagonistE protested < nl > ProtagonistE slammed ProtagonistE's fists into the battle map hard .  Without them , we are still the 262nd legion of the Emperor !  ProtagonistE's teeth ground together tightly as ProtagonistE shouted .  And the 262nd legion does not know defeat !  < nl > ProtagonistE stared them down until they both gave ProtagonistE a nod which allowed ProtagonistE to slip deflated back into ProtagonistE's seat .  ProtagonistE want a new approach strategy by sun - up ,  ProtagonistE sighed heavily  Dismissed .  < nl > As they left the holotent , ProtagonistD made sure they were far enough away before ProtagonistD exploded . < nl >  ProtagonistC is gon na kill us all ,  ProtagonistD looked pale even as ProtagonistD fumed  Without vehicles we wo n't last a week camped out into the open like this , let alone manage an assault on ProtagonistC .  < nl > ProtagonistA hated it when ProtagonistD was right , but ProtagonistA could n't deny the truth in ProtagonistD's words . They had both seen it in ProtagonistC , that mad hunger for victory which had ultimately consigned them to a fate of inevitable death and ruin . < nl >  We have to do something ,  ProtagonistD muttered ,  We could poison ProtagonistC's wine or something , convince ProtagonistC that this plan is utter madness .  < nl >  We 'd risk martyring ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistA bit away at ProtagonistA's nails as ProtagonistA's mind worked overtime .  Plus , it would be an act of high treason if anyone found out .  < nl > ProtagonistD scoffed  Rather that than a slow and agonizing death ,  < nl >  It may not come down to either ,  ProtagonistA smiled as ProtagonistA turned to face ProtagonistD .  Can we secure enough supplies for a cohort to last up to two weeks in the mountain passes .  < nl > ProtagonistA thought about it for a second .  How quickly ?  < nl >  Ideally tomorrow .  < nl > ProtagonistA pulled out a holobook and scratched down a few calculations .  In theory , yes , but-  < nl >  Perfect , ProtagonistA 'll ready ProtagonistA's men for the trek and we 'll reconvene at sun - up .  ProtagonistA smirked as ProtagonistA slapped ProtagonistD on the shoulder .  Bring ProtagonistD's hiking cape .  < nl >  Wait , ProtagonistD 'm coming with ?  < nl > ProtagonistA shrugged .  ProtagonistD can take ProtagonistD's chances with the palisade , but ProtagonistA would n't bet on it still standing by the time we come back .  < nl >  Fine ,  ProtagonistD answered grimly  But what the hell do we tell ProtagonistE .  < nl > ProtagonistA smiled back .  The truth ,  ProtagonistA patted the vibrosword at ProtagonistA's side .  That we 're gon na go kill some aliens .  < eos > 
< sos > The protocol was simple enough for even the least educated slave to understand . They were to wait for the master of ceremonies to declare that dinner had commenced , and for the accompanying music to play , before they strode into the great hall of the * Ignitus * . A hundred dishes , balanced on the palms of a hundred slaves , a meal fit for the gods . < nl > Except that when it came time for them to exit , ProtagonistA remained in ProtagonistA's place , no more than twenty paces away from ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA ignored ProtagonistA's fellow slaves who tugged at ProtagonistA's sleeves , and instead shooed them away . They scattered , nervously tugging at the collars around their throats . < nl >  ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said . But those of House Mercellus did n't hear ProtagonistA - they were too absorbed in the events beyond the plexiglass panels , those invisible barriers which separated them from the cold embrace of space . In the distance , tiny stars burned and flared in rapid succession . < nl >  ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA repeated , more firmly this time .  ProtagonistA bring urgent news . ProtagonistB !  < nl >  Hmm ? ProtagonistA , not now , please ,  said ProtagonistB .  There is a time and place for everything . We 've travelled this far out to watch this phenomena with our own eyes , so whatever it is ProtagonistA 're complaining about this time , it can wait . ProtagonistB promise , ProtagonistB will listen to ProtagonistA later-  < nl >  No , ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB need to hear this now . This * very instant * .  < nl > ProtagonistA's tone was more than enough for the guards nearby to rouse from their lethargy . They gripped their shock - lances and thrummed them to life . Other slaves had paid the price for far less insubordination , but even they knew that ProtagonistA was a favourite here , and so they waited on ProtagonistB's response . Far easier to follow a cue than to strike their own path . < nl >  ProtagonistB said , later . Now is not the time .  ProtagonistB was a fair man , more patient than most , but a shadow of displeasure had manifested in a scowl on ProtagonistB's face .  Do not try ProtagonistB's patience , ProtagonistA .  < nl > ProtagonistA shrugged , then flung the dish ProtagonistA had brought in against the far side of the great hall . The fine ceramics shattered against the plexiglass , and as pickled pork knuckles slid down , ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB's brothers and sisters , leapt to their feet . < nl >  How dare ProtagonistA ! Have ProtagonistA gone mad !  ProtagonistB held ProtagonistB's bracelet up high , then said ,  Are ProtagonistA spoiling for a beating , ProtagonistA ? A simple press of this button , and ProtagonistB do n't care how well - trained ProtagonistA are , ProtagonistA will have no choice but to * submit * !  < nl >  We have walked into a trap , ProtagonistB . If we do not respond now , all is lost .  < nl > ProtagonistA noted , with a measure of satisfaction , the confusion which settled over them like cobwebs - too fine to grasp , too unnatural to ignore . < nl >  There 's no such thing as a ' chain - link of star explosions ' . That 's a lie . House Marcellus was lured out here to this unmanned sector of space for a reason .  < nl >  Watch ProtagonistA's tongue , ProtagonistA ! Remember ProtagonistA's place ! ProtagonistB was given good intel that this once - in - a - lifetime occurrence was-  < nl >  What those are , * ProtagonistB , are warp - drive destination beacons . ProtagonistB's enemies are moving in on ProtagonistB's this very second , and ProtagonistB do n't even know it .  < nl >  Nonsense , again ! Even if that were true , the * Ignitus * has three guard starships in close range ! We are hardly at any risk here .  < nl > ProtagonistA sighed .  This is a classic Drusan tactic , ProtagonistB . Where ProtagonistA come here , we like to divide our enemies , jam their communications , then pick them off one by one . And if our enemies choose to serve themselves up to us , spend their time gawking at fireworks instead of getting ready for war ... well , then , so be it . But before ProtagonistB go any further to chastise ProtagonistA , please , just try linking up with the other ships .  < nl > The smile on ProtagonistA's face only grew wider as ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB , then ProtagonistB's brothers and sisters , all take turns on their personal communicators . ProtagonistA waited until every single face had turned white before ProtagonistA continued . < nl >  You still have time , ProtagonistA can still help ,  ProtagonistA said , as ProtagonistA pointed in the direction of the plexiglass again .  By ProtagonistA's estimates , the enemy ships will still need about ... ten minutes to get in range . If we can get-  < nl >  Tell ProtagonistB's guards what they need to know ,  said ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB 'll have ProtagonistC here , ProtagonistA can tell ProtagonistC what they need to do .  < nl >  No , ProtagonistA wo n't do that ,  said ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA tapped ProtagonistA's collar , then smiled .  Are ProtagonistB really going to have us argue about chain of command when there 's a battle around the corner . No . Set ProtagonistA free . ProtagonistA will lead them for ProtagonistB .  < nl > They would have argued further - it was in both their natures . But it was also at that moment that the alarms sounded . It was not a sharp , abrasive alarm . Instead , it was a low - toned , roiling alarm , one which brought to mind deep - sea whales going about their mating calls . It reverberated through the hall , grinding against their bones . < nl >  ProtagonistB ,  said ProtagonistA .  Not much time left . Set ProtagonistA free , and ProtagonistA promise ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA will have the enemy pushed back within the hour . Either that , or we can all perish here .  < nl > ProtagonistB sighed , then tapped the unlock sequence into ProtagonistB's bracelet . Then , when it failed to register , ProtagonistB tapped it in again , faster this time . Still , where there was supposed to be a confirmatory * beep * to signal that ProtagonistB had released ProtagonistA's restraints , there was no response at all . < nl >  Strange ,  ProtagonistB said .  It ca n't seem to detect that ProtagonistA ...  < nl > ProtagonistA reached behind ProtagonistA's neck , then unclasped ProtagonistA's collar . It came off with a pop , and ProtagonistA dropped it with a resounding bang . < nl >  ProtagonistA had already deactivated it ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA just wanted to see if ProtagonistB would place ProtagonistB's trust in ProtagonistA . And since ProtagonistB evidently have , though with some prodding , ProtagonistA 'll see that ProtagonistB 're not disappointed .  < nl > ProtagonistA walked over to ProtagonistD , then wrested ProtagonistD's shock - lance away from ProtagonistD . ProtagonistA drove it hard into the ground , and its tip lit up in an electric fire . The glow against ProtagonistA's face only served to underscore the bloodthirst in ProtagonistA . < nl >  ProtagonistA 'll show ProtagonistD what a Drusan warrior can do , ProtagonistD . Then , perhaps , ProtagonistD can re - evaluate whether ProtagonistD really did manage to enslave ProtagonistA's people , or whether we entered ProtagonistD's service for a reason .  < nl > --- < nl > /r / rarelyfunny < eos > 
< sos >  Okay ProtagonistA , so who did ProtagonistA want to be today ?  < nl > ProtagonistA looked down at ProtagonistA's feet .  I'unno . ProtagonistA just wanna ... ProtagonistA just wanna walk again . And hug ProtagonistA's brother .  < nl >  Well , I can give ProtagonistA telekinesis- ProtagonistA could move ProtagonistA's own body that way . Or I could make ProtagonistA an exoskeleton .  I gulped . It was usually easier with the kids who wanted something outlandish . The ones who just wanted to do something normal were a lot harder , making someone /just/ telekinetic enough to move their own body was a lot more difficult than outright giving them the general power . It needed to be highly refined , accounting for weight and the feeling of moving ones own body . < nl > Somehow , it was a lot more satisfying , too . < nl >  Tele - tele , whatever . ProtagonistA wo n't need a big heavy machine , right ?  < nl >  Nope ,  I replied .  But ProtagonistA 'll need a little practice .  < nl >  ProtagonistA 'd like that .  < nl >  Okay . ProtagonistA 're going to need to sit on that thing in the corner so I can weigh and measure ProtagonistA , okay ? The nurses will give ProtagonistA a hand .  < nl > I planned my camera and got to work . Weight calibrations . ProtagonistA 'd be able to walk by the sheer force of will , which ProtagonistA had in spades . < nl > If ProtagonistA survived treatment ProtagonistA 'd need to come back pretty often for a power adjustment . Sadly , if someone was sent to me , that usually meant it was a last wish . You had to be very far gone to even be allows it or ... < nl > Well , most people died from prolonged exposure , I mused , running the subroutine that was the former shred of my humanity . < nl > It was still better than the alternative . < eos > 
< sos > As ProtagonistA awoke , < nl > ProtagonistA first thought it a joke , < nl > That the night before was so clear . < nl > But with a cold creeping sweat , < nl > ProtagonistA did recollect , < nl > How the Dwarves had rung in New Year . < nl > ProtagonistB , < nl > Had drunk all the champagne , < nl > And went streaking down through the hall . < nl > ProtagonistC thought it a lass , < nl > Complimented ProtagonistB , < nl > But got more than ProtagonistC bargained for . < nl > As for ProtagonistD , < nl > ProtagonistD lowered ProtagonistD's shoulders , < nl > As ProtagonistD watched ProtagonistD's husband be kissed . < nl > Although a mistake , < nl > His trousers did quake , < nl > ProtagonistB had stolen ProtagonistD's bliss . < nl > With swift resolution , < nl > ProtagonistD found a solution , < nl > As ProtagonistD sharpened the blade of ProtagonistD's axe . < nl > First ProtagonistD did trim , < nl > But ProtagonistD's hair was still grim , < nl > So for the first time , a dwarf did wax . < nl > When ProtagonistC saw ProtagonistD , < nl > ProtagonistC said ' ProtagonistD ProtagonistC adore ProtagonistD , < nl > ProtagonistC forgot 'bout the goods under there . ' < nl > But ProtagonistD did scolder , < nl > Shoved ProtagonistC up by a boulder , < nl > Said ' ProtagonistD 'm more than what 's under ProtagonistD's hair ! ' < nl > ' Lover forgive ProtagonistD , < nl > ProtagonistD know ProtagonistD 'm no Gimli , < nl > ProtagonistD 'm begging you please take ProtagonistD back . ' < nl > ' Only if you do the same ... < nl > If you can handle the pain , < nl > Of waxing each crevis and crack . ' < nl > ProtagonistA remembered , < nl > The tears that descended , < nl > The face of a man full of fear . < nl > ProtagonistA reached for a bottle , < nl > ProtagonistA's memory ProtagonistA 'd throttle , < nl > Of another damned Dwarven New Year . < eos > 
< sos >  Explain to me again how it works ?  < nl > We 're in bed . It 's warm . Heavy down . The ceiling fan * clap - clap - claps * . < nl > ProtagonistA rubs my chest . Stares up at the fan . < nl >  They ... well , ProtagonistA guess they sort of * shoot * electricity into your brain ,  ProtagonistA says .  Not a lot . A little . Then you have like a seizure . Then it 's over .  < nl >  Sounds awful ,  I say .  How 's it help ?  < nl >  Kinda resets your brain , ProtagonistA think .  ProtagonistA 's making that face . Pursed lips . Half - closed eyes . The * Worry Has Turned to Anger * face .  It 's probably a scam . Just torture . Just taking ProtagonistA's money .  < nl >  But ProtagonistB ...  < nl >  Yeah . ProtagonistB thinks it 'll help .  < nl > The hand is still on my chest .  Are ProtagonistA mad at me for making ProtagonistA go ?  < nl > ProtagonistA does n't answer . ProtagonistA probably is , but does n't want to say .  You ca n't make ProtagonistA do anything . ProtagonistA went because ProtagonistA went .  < nl >  I thought it 'd just be talking ,  I say .  I thought that 's what therapy is . Just talking . Maybe some drugs .  < nl >  It 's that ,  ProtagonistA says , nodding .  And sometimes , when * that * does n't work , it 's things like ECT . Nobody knows .  ProtagonistA sighs .  Nobody knows . It 's all guessing .  < nl >  Did talking make ProtagonistA feel better at all ?  < nl > ProtagonistA gets up off the bed .  Not any better than talking to you .  < nl >  I 'm not a therapist .  < nl >  You 're a good listener .  < nl >  Well .... yeah .  < nl >  Talking helps . It helps ProtagonistA understand things . But ProtagonistA need a little more than understanding .  ProtagonistA finds one of the many framed pictures in the room , picking it up , looking at the image , then setting it back down - face down - on ProtagonistA's dresser . All the pictures are like that . Face down . ProtagonistA does n't like seeing the faces of ProtagonistA's friends and family until ProtagonistA wants to see the faces . ProtagonistA does n't like them watching ProtagonistA . < nl >  How many times ?  < nl > ProtagonistA looks at me .  How many times do ProtagonistA have to shoot electricity into ProtagonistA's brain ? Dunno . Maybe 10 maybe 50 . It causes memory problems . Looking forward to that ...  < nl >  Oh . But that 's not ...  < nl >  It 's like changing the wiring in ProtagonistA's brain ,  ProtagonistA says .  It 'll help ... it'll just help . Or it wo n't .  < nl >  Then it 's worth trying .  < nl > ProtagonistA nods , then moves to the door .  Okay . ProtagonistA got ta go . Mom 's taking ProtagonistA . You be good . You 're in charge while ProtagonistA 'm gone .  < nl >  I 'm always good ,  I say .  Good luck .  < nl > ProtagonistA smirks , opens the doors , then leaves . I 'm alone . The ceiling fan * clap - clap - claps * . I ca n't move . I can only wait . I can only watch the ceiling fan . I can only wonder who ProtagonistA 'll be when ProtagonistA comes back . If anything will change . < nl > I could n't do anything that day in ProtagonistA's first room , the pink and white one , with unicorns and a towering dollhouse in the corner . I could only sit on ProtagonistA's pillow , there in the dark , on the day after Christmas , as ProtagonistA's uncle crept into the room and whispered things into ProtagonistA's ear , things I could n't hear . Eventually I fell on the floor . Eventually I was knocked under the bed . I think that 's why ProtagonistA still talks to me . Why ProtagonistA does n't mind me looking at ProtagonistA . Because I was n't looking at ProtagonistA then . Like the framed pictures were . And the posters were . And the dolls were . < nl > This is our fourth bedroom . Things change . Things stay the same . I 've sat on so many pillows and watched ProtagonistA lose ProtagonistA . Watched ProtagonistA hurt ProtagonistA . Watched ProtagonistA's wrap braided blankets around ProtagonistA's throat and look desperately for some place to hang the other end . < nl > All I 've ever been able to do is talk to ProtagonistA . Or , I suppose , mostly just listen . < nl > Somewhere far , far away , I feel something like a tingle . Like I 've come out of the dryer and I 'm crackling all over . The feeling lasts less than a minute , but at the end I can no longer hear the ceiling fan . I can no longer see the bedroom door . < nl > I 'm still here . Still me . But all that is is just a dusty , gray bear . Flattened . Patchy . < nl > There 's nothing to hear and there 's nothing to see . There 's nothing to say . < nl > I ca n't say anything at all . < nl > Then I remember that really , I never could , could I ? < nl > Everything is dark . < nl > At least I still remember ProtagonistA . < nl > That 's more than enough for an old bear like me . < eos > 
< sos >  OK now  muttered ProtagonistA  this is getting ridiculous  . ProtagonistA stared at ProtagonistB . < nl > ProtagonistB noticed ProtagonistA staring , instead of summoning dark flocks of crows .  What is it , too scared to fight ?  ProtagonistB raised an eyebrow . < nl > ProtagonistA sputtered ,  No , ProtagonistA am just apalled at the direction the league of heros has apparently taken  . ProtagonistA called ProtagonistA's powers now , ravenous shadows emerging from ProtagonistA's finely tailored cloak .  Why on earth does ProtagonistB's suit have a boob window now ? What even is the point of the suit ? ! ProtagonistB might as well be wearing a t - shirt !  < nl > Wings of fire radiated from ProtagonistB's shoulders , flapping once and scorching the air around ProtagonistB .  Hey now , ProtagonistB think it looks alright , and besides , suits are for the public in ProtagonistB's case , not for protection .  < nl > ProtagonistA's shadows coalesced into something larger , its ghastly call echoing off the scyscrapers of New London .  And why is it skin tight ? ! I 've seen porn , nay , MOST PORN has less fetishized gear . What happened to the classy gold armor ? Or that one red dress ?  < nl > ProtagonistB let ProtagonistB's fire cloak ProtagonistB , but kept shouting , embarassed  That dress was n't even a suit ! And what if this is more comfortable ? < nl >  And why is ProtagonistA's phoenix dive now shaped like a naked women ! ? ! ? !  ProtagonistA was ignoring ProtagonistB now  Instead of a PHOENIX ? The league has you changing your TECHNIQUES ? They might as well call you  Naked Fire Women  now ! This is just , this is unconscionable , ProtagonistA respect ProtagonistB too much for this to stand , ProtagonistA am going to have a word with Myst , this is ridic-his words were cut off as the flaming giant rammed in to ProtagonistA . < nl > ---- < nl >  Soooooo , how was ProtagonistA  Aura said slyly . < nl > ProtagonistB huffed  ProtagonistA got away  . < nl >  Now , you know that 's not what I 'm asking about  < nl >  FINE , ProtagonistA hated it , ok ?  ProtagonistB groaned ,  ProtagonistB was just trying to be more appealing you know ?  < nl > Aura nodded sagely ,  Told ProtagonistB . Maybe ProtagonistB should , I do n't know , actually try flirting like a normal person ?  < nl >  ProtagonistB have literally no experience dating ok ! ?  ProtagonistB grumbled  ProtagonistA did say ProtagonistA respected ProtagonistB ! Maybe we should try a new suit , you know , the gold armor one .  < nl >  That 's what I told ProtagonistB to stick with ! We know windows are out , but ProtagonistB could be a bit more subtle about it ! Want it to have armor - boobs this time ?  < nl >  .... maybe  . < eos > 
< sos > The crash and boom from the front of the bank echoed throughout the whole building .   ProtagonistA sat up with a scowl . < nl >  The hell 's goin' on out there ?    ProtagonistA roared at ProtagonistA's minions .   They scurried away , having the presence of mind to know that ProtagonistA was not in a good mood .   ProtagonistA did n't like disturbances , and that sounded like a disturbance . < nl > ProtagonistB just shook ProtagonistB's head , turning back to the locked vault ProtagonistB was at work on .   Breaking into banks was not at all ProtagonistB's style , but ProtagonistB did n't get to choose where the folks with the tech kept their goods .   ProtagonistB 'd been at this game a long , * long * time , as the grey lacing ProtagonistB's hair proved .   Sometimes , you just had to adapt . < nl > The sound of footsteps brought ProtagonistB up short . < nl >  What was it ?    ProtagonistB hissed , craning ProtagonistB's head around , and then stopped . < nl > The sight before ProtagonistB was not ProtagonistB's sweaty , black - jacketed thugs for hire .   ProtagonistC loomed over ProtagonistB , six feet of taut , gently muscled woman topped with a mane of strawberry blonde hair . < nl >  Not what ProtagonistB were expecting ?    ProtagonistC purred , flicking a finger idly .   A little ball of fire swirled at the tip with every twitch . < nl > ProtagonistB stared , eyes narrowed .   ProtagonistB 'd been in the business a long time .   The fashion trends of heroes had always been a moving target - ranging from the universally unappealing unitard designs of the earliest Gifted to the more risque adopted by the ' forward thinking ' women heros of the last decade .   ProtagonistB was well used to seeing more of a hero than ProtagonistB ever really * wanted * to . < nl > But this ... < nl >  Is n't that uncomfortable ?    ProtagonistB blurted out , eyeing ProtagonistC incredulously .   The way the fabric was cut out in strategic areas , leaving skin exposed ... the high cut around the sides ... It * had * to be riding up .   There was no way ProtagonistC * was n't * pulling spandex out of ProtagonistC's ass every three minutes .   ProtagonistC blinked , competely taken aback . < nl >  Excuse ProtagonistC ?    ProtagonistC said slowly , the words ominously drawn out .   The little fireball circling ProtagonistC's finger was n't so little anymore .   ProtagonistB 'd really rather not be burned to cinders in the little room .   ProtagonistB turned back to the vault , just so that ProtagonistB would n't have to look at ProtagonistC .   ProtagonistB was * not * blushing , ProtagonistB told ProtagonistB . < nl > ProtagonistB could end this .   ProtagonistB could put a stop to this , right now .   ProtagonistC just reeked of green inexperience .   But , ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistB's own powers , and , well .   If ProtagonistB stepped in , with ProtagonistC like * that * , there was only one way this was going to end . < nl > ProtagonistB could n't quite bring ProtagonistB to go there .   Not yet . < nl >  ProtagonistB thought ProtagonistB were so clever , eh , ProtagonistA ?    ProtagonistC drawled , slowly circling around ProtagonistA .   ProtagonistA's head swiveled around stubbornly , facing the other way no matter how ProtagonistC wandered .    ProtagonistA did n't * really * think ProtagonistA could just waltz in here and take it , did ProtagonistA ?  < nl > ProtagonistA ground ProtagonistA's teeth together in frustration .   It was like ProtagonistC was reading the script to some horrible , cheesy cartoon . < nl >  This ProtagonistC's first week ?    ProtagonistA managed .   The pacing stopped . < nl >  That 's not relevant , is it ?   Hands where ProtagonistC can see them , * ProtagonistB * .   Nice and high .  < nl > ProtagonistB glanced up .   ProtagonistC was standing right in front of ProtagonistB .   The fabric - what little there was of it - was drawn tight , like the slightest nudge would send ProtagonistC spinning free .   ProtagonistB gulped .   ProtagonistC was young enough to be ProtagonistB's * daughter * , damnit .   This was * not * in the job description . < nl >  ProtagonistB 'd rather not , if that 's all right with ProtagonistC .    ProtagonistB muttered , spreading ProtagonistB's hands out to either side .   ProtagonistC clicked ProtagonistC's tongue , resuming ProtagonistC's walk .   ProtagonistC's high stilletos groaned in complaint . < nl >  Whatever .   Police will be here soon anyway .  < nl >  Just thought ProtagonistB seemed new .   That 's tough , ProtagonistC feel ProtagonistB .   It's ... hard for new Gifted to get their costumes tailored in time .  ProtagonistB started , eyes still downturned .   The thought of ProtagonistC continuing like this just did n't sit right with ProtagonistB .   If ProtagonistC was n't going to let ProtagonistB talk head - on , then ProtagonistB 'd come at it from the side . < nl >  Oh , that was n't a problem .    ProtagonistC said , laughing under ProtagonistC's breath .    ProtagonistC know ProtagonistC's way around a sewing machine .  < nl >  Made it ProtagonistC , did ProtagonistC ?    ProtagonistB said weakly . < nl >  ProtagonistC like to stand on ProtagonistC's own , when ProtagonistC can .   ProtagonistB about done ?  < nl >  Oh , ProtagonistB 'm just musin ' .   Do n't mind an old man .    ProtagonistA said quickly , plastering an innocent grin onto ProtagonistA's face .    Only , the Enhancement from the shops are * pretty useful * .    ProtagonistA tried to make ProtagonistA's tone as convincing as possible .    ProtagonistA 'd hate for ProtagonistC to get hurt by somethin' ProtagonistC were n't expectin ' .  < nl > The proper tailoring shops would * also * never , ever allow their heros to walk around in something like * that * .   ProtagonistC was going to catch a cold , even if ProtagonistC did n't get taken out by a villain looking at ProtagonistC the wrong way . < nl > Distantly , ProtagonistA could hear the sound of sirens , and swore softly .   ProtagonistC chuckled , ProtagonistC's voice low and soft . < nl >  Almost time , is n't it ?   Keep those hands out , now .   No tricks .  < nl >  No tricks .    ProtagonistA said , still with that dumb grin on ProtagonistA's face .   ProtagonistC was an idiot .   A well - meaning idiot , but ProtagonistA could n't stand around and let ProtagonistC get ProtagonistC hurt right at the start of ProtagonistA's career . < nl > And so when ProtagonistC lapped ProtagonistA again , making one last round of the little back room , ProtagonistA threw ProtagonistA's amplifiers into overdrive . < nl > ProtagonistC shrieked , throwing ProtagonistC's arms up reflexively as the vibrations shook the air .   ProtagonistA had one last instant to confirm that yes , in fact , the laws of physics were still functioning , and then ProtagonistA slammed ProtagonistA's eyes shut . < nl > Pushing ProtagonistA's way past ProtagonistC , ProtagonistA made for the door .   ProtagonistA was going to be cutting things * close * .   ProtagonistA's men were screwed , but that was their own damn fault .   It was n't worth ProtagonistA's skin to save them . < nl > One last glance over ProtagonistA's shoulder showed ProtagonistC sitting in a quivering , trembling heap , grabbing at the scraps of cloth that used to be ProtagonistC's uniform .   All of the clever bits of glue ProtagonistC 'd used to hold ProtagonistC in had given up in the face of simple resonant vibrations , all of the teensy straps holding artistically cut sections snapped by tension . < nl > The police were going to get a * show * when they came to arrest ProtagonistC , ProtagonistA thought .   The thought did n't make ProtagonistA happy , although ProtagonistA * was * a little satisfied with ProtagonistA regardless .   ProtagonistA 'd done a good deed that day .   And they said all villains were evil . < nl > ProtagonistA could manage one more , while ProtagonistA was at it . < nl >  There 's a great little costuming shop , down by that hero mechanic 's garage .   South District .   Ask for ProtagonistD .    ProtagonistA said , pausing at the doorway .    Tell ProtagonistD ProtagonistB sent ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistD might even .... ah ... squeeze ProtagonistB in .  < nl > Before ProtagonistC could say a word , rapidly turning incandescent from rage or humiliation , ProtagonistA fled , unable to contain ProtagonistA's grin . < nl > ( /r / inorai , critiques always welcome ! ) < eos > 
< sos > From beneath the comforting fabric of ProtagonistA's black robe , ProtagonistA sighed . This had to be ProtagonistA's third museum heist this year already , and it 's not like there were that many museums to pick from . At this rate , ProtagonistA 'd have to start stealing from the Musical Instrument Museum or the History of Dairy Museum soon . < nl > Still : the display of Incan Relics at the Museum of Indigenous Peoples was worth the risk of repeating oneself . As a bonus , the artifacts were valuable enough that people would assume ProtagonistA was stealing them just to re - sell them , never guessing ProtagonistA * true * purpose . < nl > ProtagonistA adjusted ProtagonistA's burnished metal eye - mask , scanning the room carefully . After ProtagonistA was done here , ProtagonistA could do some banks , maybe try a government building to shake things up . ProtagonistA was getting to a point where ProtagonistA had ProtagonistA's legacy to think about , after all . < nl > ProtagonistA approached the first display case and carefully rolled down one of ProtagonistA's elbow - length gloves , sliding it off and folding the black silk in ProtagonistA's hand . ProtagonistA delicately placed a carefully manicured finger on the glass and waited as obsidian waves emanated from the point of contact . ProtagonistA felt the resistance give way as the surface changed to dark ether , then casually reached in and grabbed the ceremonial headdress waiting within . < nl > ProtagonistA's cloak rustled as ProtagonistA turned on the heel of one of ProtagonistA's knee - length boots , moving on to the next relic . Just as ProtagonistA was about to lay ProtagonistA's hand on the case , ProtagonistA froze . < nl > Garish fluorescent lights began flashing around the walls of the room . A rich , baritone voice behind ProtagonistA commanded ,  Stop right there , ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistA have been caught red - handed by ProtagonistB .  < nl > ProtagonistA groaned .  That is , hands down , the * worst * name ProtagonistA 've ever heard ,  ProtagonistA called out , still not moving ,  and keep in mind that ProtagonistA 've faced off against * Fry Guy * and someone who called himself * Montezuma 's Revenge * .  < nl >  Divulging ProtagonistA's evil plan will not help save ProtagonistA from ProtagonistB's technological might , ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistA are about to get a one - way ticket to Justice Town !  < nl > At this , ProtagonistA turned around , a fiery retort on ProtagonistA's lips . Whatever ProtagonistA was about to say , though , ended up coming out as a quiet  What in the actual f--  < nl > Standing before ProtagonistA , arms akimbo , legs shoulder length apart , was ... ProtagonistA actually was n't quite sure what ProtagonistA was looking at , because the colored lights ProtagonistA had noticed earlier were sweeping across ProtagonistA's vision . < nl >  Listen , would ProtagonistB mind ... turning those off ? ProtagonistA think ProtagonistB 're going to give ProtagonistA epilepsy if ProtagonistA look at ProtagonistB much longer .  < nl > ProtagonistB frowned , then brought a forearm to chest level and touched some buttons on a small control panel there . The lights turned off .  It 's cyan , magenta , yel --  < nl >  ProtagonistA do n't care . At all  ProtagonistA interjected . < nl > There was an awkward pause as ProtagonistA's eyes adjusted to the dim lighting in the museum . ProtagonistB broke the silence :  ProtagonistB wield the power of a * computer * ! Now , ProtagonistB will use ProtagonistB's technology to turn on the lights - without using a switch !  < nl > ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head .  Look , ProtagonistB , let ProtagonistA give ProtagonistB some -- holy hell what is * that * ?  < nl > ProtagonistB had turned 90 degrees , aiming ProtagonistB's wrist control at   the wall , and then paused .  What is what ?  < nl > ProtagonistA had not noticed in the low light before , but now that ProtagonistB was in profile ... < nl >  Are ProtagonistB - ProtagonistB can't ... is that a * codpiece * ! ?  < nl > ProtagonistB looked downward , then back at ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB don't ... think so . What 's a codpiece ?  < nl > All that was visible of ProtagonistA's face beneath ProtagonistA's hood was ProtagonistA's mouth , and it was currently contorted in horror .  ProtagonistB ... that 's * ProtagonistB * ? Good God ! Get ... get ... some compression shorts , or a ... a cup , or ... duct tape ? Something . * Anything * .  < nl >  Ha ha ha ! Your attempts to distract ProtagonistB will not work !  ProtagonistB clicked a button and light flooded the room . ProtagonistA screamed . < nl >  Ahh ! It 's even worse ! Where is the rest of it ? Why are ProtagonistB ... did ProtagonistB shave ProtagonistB's * abdomen * but not ProtagonistB's * legs * ? And ... are those ... are those * nipples * ?  < nl > ProtagonistB shifted awkwardly as ProtagonistB looked down again . ProtagonistB had a molded breastplate that left ProtagonistB's midriff bare , like some sort of medieval sports bra . The lights were mounted on the shoulders . Below the waist , ProtagonistB was wearing tight - extremely tight - shorts , and they were definitely short . ProtagonistB looked like a basketball player from the early 80 's . For reasons that ProtagonistA could not fathom , there was nothing from ProtagonistB's mid - thigh to ProtagonistB's lower calf , leaving ProtagonistB's hairy legs exposed . < nl >  What ?  ProtagonistB frowned .  ProtagonistB made it ProtagonistB !  < nl > ProtagonistA's lips were now closed tight , the corners of ProtagonistA's mouth twitching .  ProtagonistB ... don't say .  ProtagonistA looked ProtagonistB over again , cocking ProtagonistA's head to one side .  Oh ... oh , honey , no . What 's on ProtagonistB's head ?  < nl >  It 's a fedora . Why ?  < nl > ProtagonistA's body was shaking with barely repressed laughter now .  But ... what 's on top of ProtagonistB's ... fedora ?  < nl >  It 's the energy pack ! ProtagonistB could n't figure out how to strap it on ProtagonistB without it burning ProtagonistB . See ?  < nl > ProtagonistB turned around and showed ProtagonistB's bare lower back , which was marred by an ugly , rectangular welt . < nl > It was too much . ProtagonistA threw ProtagonistA's head back and the empty museum rooms echoed with the sounds of ProtagonistA's cackles . ProtagonistB's eyes were wide as ProtagonistB stared down at the floor .  ProtagonistB need to power ProtagonistB's unit somehow ,  ProtagonistB said quietly . < nl >  ProtagonistB's UNIT !  ProtagonistA shrieked , tears running freely down ProtagonistA's face .  To be honest , ProtagonistA think ProtagonistB's * unit * has plenty of power already ! Oh ... oh ... ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA peed ProtagonistA a little . Your unit !  ProtagonistA continued laughing , dabbing at ProtagonistA's eyes with the glove ProtagonistA had removed earlier .  Okay , kid , ProtagonistA ... ProtagonistA ca n't take this anymore . ProtagonistA 'll go with ProtagonistB if ProtagonistB promise to never go out in public dressed like this ever again .  < nl > ProtagonistA had mostly recovered but every now and then something would set ProtagonistA off and ProtagonistA would lapse into a burst of giggles . ProtagonistB gave a somber nod , ProtagonistB's face tight , and escorted ProtagonistA out of the building . < nl > * * * < nl > /r / ShadowsofClouds < eos > 
< sos > It was always difficult , adapting to a new body . It was probably the most challenging aspect of covert reconnaissance missions . < nl > Issues like understanding the local language and culture , those were merely a matter of information absorption and enough simulation time . < nl > Adapting to a new body , however , a new biology , that was different . < nl > It always surprised people , when ProtagonistA told them . Because the remarkable similarity of sapient organic life across the galaxy was a known fact , something every schoolchild knew and accepted . < nl > It seemed there were only so many successful body plans . Most aquatic races shared common body shapes . And similarly , most land dwellers were bilaterally symmetrical bipeds . < nl > There were indisputable advantages to the usual packages of features . Opposable thumbs for tool use , walking upright for energy - efficient - if unstable - locomotion , warm - blooded biology for better temperature control . < nl > But still , adapting to a new body always bothered ProtagonistA . < nl > That was difficult for many of ProtagonistA's friends and family to understand . They did n't quite comprehend when ProtagonistA explained the issue . < nl > Certainly , there were issues such as the different proportions of arms and legs , the specific posture and stance demanded by bone structure . But those were matters that knowledge implants and automated reflex systems were designed to deal with . < nl > Intellectually , there should n't have been any difficulty . < nl > And in practical terms , there was n't any problem . In practical terms , ProtagonistA could function . The implanted knowledge , the recorded skills , these addressed the functional challenges . < nl > The many subsystems installed in ProtagonistA's new body handled issues like balance , or precision in delicate physical movement . There was , for example , no need to learn how to walk in the new body . That was all handled for ProtagonistA . < nl > It was the mental portion that was the disruptive aspect . Getting used to it on an emotional level . Living inside a new skin . Breathing in the scents of an alien atmosphere . Feeling comfortable with a strange face . < nl > That was the challenge , on a purely visceral level . < nl > ProtagonistA was good at ProtagonistA's job , though . < nl > It took a particular kind of personality to willingly spend entire stellar cycles encased in alien flesh , living among people of a different species . < nl > It took a particular kind of personality to embrace their way of life , to pass as one of them , undetected . < nl > Or , at least , mostly undetected . < nl > ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's emulation was n't perfect . Many of the humans ProtagonistA 'd met and interacted with at length likely considered ProtagonistA somewhat ... atypical . < nl > ProtagonistA 'd corrected many of ProtagonistA's early errors , but even now , even today , there were occasional mistakes . < nl > It was fortunate , then , that the inhabitants of this planet were high enough on the civilisational scale - at least in social terms - that any of ProtagonistA's oddities were largely accepted by the natives . < nl > They would not judge , at least not overtly . < nl > And , more importantly , they would not suspect . < nl > However , ProtagonistA still endeavoured to correct any mistakes . < nl > Some were ProtagonistA's fault . Because even a highly - programmed and experienced field researcher like ProtagonistA ... could n't be perfect . Not quite . < nl > Some mistakes , however , were due to lack of information . There was always some nuance , some detail , some reference or area of local knowledge that the preliminary studies had overlooked . < nl > That was why ProtagonistA was here . Standing outside the transparent barrier of non - crystalline amorphous solid - the glass , the locals called it . Watching . Observing . < nl > It had been a simple conversation . ProtagonistA had thought so , anyway , until it had suddenly veered into unfamiliar territory , leaving ProtagonistA scrambling to cover ProtagonistA's inadequate local knowledge . < nl > Like many sapient beings in the galaxy , humans were fairly body - conscious . That sort of vanity , that sort of focus on the aesthetics and well - being of the physical form ... it was not completely universal , but it was a common trait . < nl > ProtagonistA 'd been very pleased , when ProtagonistA 'd discovered how much of the local electronic public - access information networks were dedicated to pornography in all its myriad forms . An observer could learn a lot about a civilisation from watching their pornography . < nl > But what they 'd missed was the fact that , to put it simply , body - modification technology was in its relative infancy on this planet . < nl > They had some degree of cosmetic surgical augmentation . Some degree of performance - enhancing biotechnology . Yet it was all remarkably primitive by interstellar standards , compared to the relative sophistication of their other sciences . < nl > For a civilisation at this overall technical and social level of development , ProtagonistA would have expected more . < nl > ProtagonistA 'd become aware of that gap , when discussing a device ProtagonistB had acquired . < nl > They had been standing in the communal rest area at their workplace , at the place of employment ProtagonistA 'd inserted ProtagonistA into , as part of ProtagonistA's local identity . < nl > ProtagonistB had shown off a new wrist device , apparently a commercial electronic product used to track and record a human 's physical movement . < nl > ProtagonistB had then asked about ProtagonistA's own exercise routine . < nl > ProtagonistA 'd deflected the question . ProtagonistA was , of course , aware of the concept , and ProtagonistA knew humans practiced it . But ProtagonistA had no actual need to do it ProtagonistA , considering that much of ProtagonistA's own body was synthetic , simply designed to mimic a human body . < nl > The small proportion of it that was biological , actual human - compatible flesh , was maintained in optimum condition by ProtagonistA's mechanical systems . < nl > The encounter had made ProtagonistA aware that ProtagonistA's appearance , ProtagonistA's size , ProtagonistA's muscle tone , ProtagonistA's general standard of health , and other physical factors ... would naturally lead most humans to assume that ProtagonistA did perform exercise regularly . They would assume ProtagonistA was familiar with their places of exercise , the facilities known as gymnasiums , or gyms . < nl > ProtagonistA did not know much about these places , save for scattered references in the entertainment media ProtagonistA had reviewed . That cursory knowledge had been enough to navigate the conversation to a satisfactory conclusion . < nl > But ProtagonistA resolved to address this gap in ProtagonistA's knowledge . < nl > That had led ProtagonistA to this location , a gym that ProtagonistB had recommended when ProtagonistB 'd claimed to be ' between routines ' . < nl > ProtagonistA's colleague had added that , aside from its comprehensive inventory of machines designed to assist humans in the practice of exercise , the gym was also a ' studio ' that offered instructional courses in a variety of disciplines , all exercise - related activities . < nl > ProtagonistA's colleague had believed ProtagonistA would be interested . < nl > ProtagonistA was now observing one of these classes , through the glass . < nl > At first ProtagonistA had been confused . Two humans had appeared to be engaging in combat . But there was no hostility , no sense of threat . And , very unsettlingly , the other humans were quietly observing , but making no move to stop the combatants . < nl > Then the two had separated , made a respectful gesture to each other , before turning to the other gathered humans . < nl > The group had then repeated the movements shown to them by the instructors . And they were instructors - ProtagonistA 'd realised that , belatedly . It made sense in context . This was , of course , a training facility . < nl > ProtagonistA looked at the group , and the building around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA considered this data point . < nl > The humans learned physical skills . They had to . There was , clearly , more to operating their bodies than the ... purely instinctive . < nl > And they did not have , ProtagonistA realised , any means of installing these lessons . No significant body modifications meant no knowledge implants . < nl > ProtagonistA looked at the class . The movements were ... sophisticated , ProtagonistA realised . Easily the rival of any of the standard recorded patterns in ProtagonistA's own library , used for the disabling and restraint of hostile humanoid sapients . < nl > Some of the movements , ProtagonistA realised , were unknown to ProtagonistA . Not recorded in ProtagonistA's database . Perhaps that was merely because ProtagonistA was a researcher , not a combat specialist , but ProtagonistA had a sudden suspicion ... < nl > ProtagonistA 'd been observing the humans for a while . They were an interesting species , but ProtagonistA had n't seen any sign of ... genius . No sign of anything special , no sign of any area in which they were extraordinary by galactic standards . < nl > But this ... < nl >  Kinesthetics ,  ProtagonistA said out loud . < nl >  What 's that , ProtagonistA ?  < nl > ProtagonistA half - turned , glancing at the human behind the reception counter , the one meant to receive arrivals to the facility . < nl >  Sorry ,  ProtagonistA said , commanding ProtagonistA to laugh , in feigned mild embarassment . ProtagonistA had a subroutine for that , and it was now practiced habit to trigger the appropriate systems . ProtagonistA also activated the custom movement ProtagonistA 'd programmed in , which lifted ProtagonistA's hand to rub the back of ProtagonistA's neck .  Just talking to ProtagonistA .  < nl >  No worries ,  the receptionist said .  ProtagonistA like the class ?  < nl >  Oh , uh , yeah ,  ProtagonistA replied ,  it 's awesome . Super cool . But , it 's just , ProtagonistA was just thinking , ProtagonistA ca n't see ProtagonistA doing something like that .  < nl >  ProtagonistA look like ProtagonistA work out , though ,  the human observed , sounding curious . < nl > ProtagonistA glanced down at ProtagonistA's body .  Well , ProtagonistA guess ? But that 's not what ProtagonistA meant . ProtagonistA 'm a klutz . No coordination , yeah ? ProtagonistA could n't do all that , uh , Kung Fu shit .  < nl > The receptionist smiled .    Hey , do n't sell ProtagonistA short . We 've got a range of self - defence courses for all skill levels . There 's a free introductory thing on Saturdays , for beginners . ProtagonistA could come , see if ProtagonistA like it . No pressure . No harm trying , right ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA said , slowly , thinking it over .  ProtagonistA guess ? Uh , ProtagonistA mean , sure ?  < nl >  Great , great , I 've got a flyer here , or you can check out the times on our website ...  < nl > * * * < nl > [ Part 2](https://www.reddit.com / r / WritingPrompts / comments/7pvelr / wp_to_most_of_the_galaxy_turning_your_body_into_a / dsm6lvy/ ) < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA was the closest the living could get to being a ghost . ProtagonistA glided through the town at night in long gowns going nowhere except for oblivion . ProtagonistA's face and shoulders were deathly pale and ProtagonistA's hair was a startling silver that just barely touched the ground . When ProtagonistA appeared , people avoided ProtagonistA , they would cross the street to avoid being on the same side of the road as ProtagonistA , whisper when ProtagonistA was out of earshot , mothers scared their children with tales of ProtagonistA , and the bards sang tales of the tragic beauty of the last of ProtagonistB , the cursed line . ProtagonistA's tale was second only to the stories of the Hole . The one at the edge of town with no end , the one that scared away many and attracted even more . < nl > Of course , the tale Clarise Fae is a story about the Hole . For every night , ProtagonistA would wander the town , but in the end ProtagonistA would stand at the edge of the Hole , peering down into nothing , trying to find answers when there were none . Answers for the past . < nl > ProtagonistA had been one of seven daughters . They all had ProtagonistA's silvery hair , the pale skin , the eyes that seemed to hold a storm behind them . ProtagonistA's sisters were playful , even joyous . ProtagonistA's parents were well respected in the town - they ran a shop selling charms guarding against the spirits that came out of the hole . Often a ProtagonistB sister or two would be around and about in the shop helping out their parents , and playing jokes on the customers . They were often hard to tell apart , but ProtagonistA stood out , even then . ProtagonistA never smiled , never , never joked . Just obediently fetched whatever ProtagonistA's parents asked ProtagonistA to from the shelves . Still , the girls were the town 's little angels - beloved by all , so few risked having children here by the Hole . < nl > So everyone in the town was heartbroken when one of them jumped in the Hole . ProtagonistC had sworn ProtagonistC had seen ProtagonistA walking about in the night and head towards the hole , almost in a trance , and of ProtagonistA's own volition , jump in . < nl > It was a tragedy , and the whole town wept for the little life that had been winked out . < nl >  Just the nature of the Hole ,  the old muttered shaking their heads ,  some children just ca n't resist .  < nl > It was a tragedy , but nothing unheard of . Nothing unheard of . The Hole was the Hole . Slowly but surely , the town moved on , and so did the family , or as much as it was possible to move on . < nl > Apparently one of them had never quite gotten over it . Soon after , another sister was seen jumping into the Hole in the dead of night . < nl > Again , the town wept . < nl >  Children take it hard , a death , you know ,  the elders said .  The two sisters had always been closer than the rest .  < nl > But it was also around this time that the first whispers started , that one child lost to the hole is understandable , but two ? From the same family ? < nl > And just as everyone had stopped reeling in shock , another Fae jumped in , once more in the dead of night . < nl > This time the elders muttered and shook their heads . Some people stopped going to the shop , but most spat at them and comforted the Fae instead .  To lose children is bad enough , but to be scorned for it is even worse ,  they said . < nl > They stopped going when the fourth and fifth sisters jumped together . < nl > Soon after , the town saw Mother , Father , and final sister walk to the Hole hand in hand . Nobody tried to stop them , either out of fear or out of sympathy . < nl > And the life of the town was gone , just like that , taken from the hole . < nl > Or , well , not all of it . < nl > ProtagonistA remained , ProtagonistA . Yet ProtagonistA lived , in a sense . ProtagonistA never talked to anyone , getting food and water from the woods . ProtagonistD said ProtagonistD once saw ProtagonistA snap the neck of a squirrel in the woods and bring it home to eat . When ProtagonistA first walked towards the hole , the town thought it was the end of ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA would jump and put an end to the curse . < nl > But ProtagonistA did n't . < nl > ProtagonistA only stood , half of ProtagonistA's feet off the edge , but ProtagonistA never did jump . < nl > On one such night ProtagonistE - a young man of about nineteen , around the same age as ProtagonistA . ProtagonistE was a fool , lured in by beauty , the long hair , the sad eyes . ProtagonistE Followed ProtagonistA in to the woods on one such trek into the hole . < nl > ProtagonistA glided out of the woods early morning , but ProtagonistE never did . < nl > Enough was enough . The townsfolk had let ProtagonistA stay despite the Hole 's Curse , but now ProtagonistA was a danger to others .  Better to be rid of ProtagonistA ,  the townsfolk reasoned .  Lest the Hole take us all .  < nl > And so they gathered behind ProtagonistA at night when ProtagonistA stood at the edge of the hole . Despite the hundred or so townsfolk behind ProtagonistA with torches , ProtagonistA did n't even bother turning around . It was like ProtagonistA did n't hear them , that there was nothing for ProtagonistA except the Hole . < nl > The townsfolk stood for a moment , doing nothing . They had expected fear , pleading , but not this , not ignorance . Eventually ProtagonistF , took initiative . ProtagonistF stepped forward , calmly and coolly , and placed a hand on ProtagonistA's back , and without a moment 's hesitation , shoved . < nl > The Townsfolk gasped , they had wanted to drive ProtagonistA out , not to give ProtagonistA to the Hole . Not even murderers deserved that fate . < nl > But it was not ProtagonistA who fell . ProtagonistA whirled to the right just as ProtagonistF shoved , and ProtagonistF found ProtagonistF off balance from the shove . ProtagonistF's screams echoed through the forest as ProtagonistF fell into the Hole . < nl > ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head at the spot ProtagonistF had been , ProtagonistA's eyes sad . And for the first time , ProtagonistA spoke .  You have come here trying to get rid of ProtagonistA , to drive ProtagonistA out , to kill ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA have tried to do the same for years now , to jump into this damn hole-  < nl > Without warning ProtagonistG charged ProtagonistA , pitchfork raised to impale ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA could have moved , but ProtagonistA stood there , as if accepting ProtagonistA's fate . The Hole rumbled . < nl > And then what appeared to be a root of a Tree appeared from the Hole , grabbed ProtagonistG by the waist and dragged ProtagonistG into the Hole in a fraction of a second . < nl > Again , ProtagonistA barely reacted , just stood with those sad eyes .  It wants ProtagonistA , see , all to itself , it is very jealous , very protective ,  ProtagonistA said . ProtagonistA hook ProtagonistA's head , and a ghost of a smile touched ProtagonistA's lips . < nl >  The Hole is in love with ProtagonistA .  < nl > No one stopped ProtagonistA as ProtagonistA glided through the crowd . Away . < nl > * * * < nl > if you enjoyed , check out [ XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com / r / XcessiveWriting/ ) < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA gently placed a slender white palm on the rocky walls of the cave and closed ProtagonistA's eyes . ProtagonistA focused , channeling all ProtagonistA's focus onto the tips of ProtagonistA's fingers . ProtagonistA could feel the concentrations of the minerals and ores beneath the surface layer of rock . A byproduct of ProtagonistA's frankly inhuman senses . ProtagonistA held for a breath for a moment as ProtagonistA felt a tiny current of air from far beneath the rock .  * Gotcha * ,  ProtagonistA murmured , under ProtagonistA's breath . < nl > Taking a step back , ProtagonistA gestured to the section of the rock cavern with a casual wave .  Here . Just bust through it , and we should be good .  The team of burly - looking miners grunted in assent and moved to work without a single cry of dissent . ProtagonistA smiled to ProtagonistA . It had n't taken long for ProtagonistA to earn their respect . ProtagonistA's reputation of being the greatest spelunker in the world was n't just for show , after all . ProtagonistA's abilities- well , and ProtagonistA's drawbacks- lent ProtagonistA nicely to the life ProtagonistA 'd chosen to lead . < nl > There was ProtagonistA's ability to see perfectly in the dark . ProtagonistA's strength and speed made it possible to escape from the most dangerous of situations unscathed , and also made ProtagonistA very handy with a pickaxe if it came right down to it . ProtagonistA could survive for weeks on end with scarcely any food or water . And of course , there was ProtagonistA's enhanced senses , the way the darkness reached out like an extension of ProtagonistA's own fingertips , allowing ProtagonistA to find sealed off parts of cave systems or rich veins of precious ores . ProtagonistA was undeniably the best . < nl > Besides , a life spent underground suited ProtagonistA well . No need to hide under a cloak all the time , darting from shade to shade . No need to stand outside every door , waiting to be invited inside . No one lived in caves anyways . And ProtagonistA 'd largely weaned ProtagonistA off of human blood . The occasional bloody steak was more than enough for ProtagonistA . Perhaps most of all , no need to deal with Kresniks that did n't * get * that ProtagonistA did n't hurt humans . < nl > ProtagonistA could n't understand why ProtagonistA's clan had disapproved so strongly of ProtagonistA's choice , and ProtagonistA had the feeling that they did n't really know why either . It was passed down from generation to generation .  Never head underground . It is not a place for vampires like us .  Nothing more than folklore , some superstition made to keep young vampire children out of caves . ProtagonistA had snorted at the very idea , and scoffed at the suggestion that ProtagonistA was doing something dangerous . It was the * perfect * job for ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA loved it . < nl > Now , ProtagonistA was leading a team into the deepest section of the Ruby Cave . Despite the name , there were no rubies in sight , but it was legendary nonetheless . Rumour had it that the depths of the cave held treasures beyond human imagination . Half the cave system was sealed off , blocked by dislodged rocks from an earthquake years ago . No one even knew where to start digging , but ProtagonistA was different . Slowly but surely , ProtagonistA could lead a team to where no one had set foot in a thousand years . < nl > As they burst through the thick section of rock , the tunnel opened up into a more spacious cave . ProtagonistA grinned , and took a step into the newly - discovered cavern . Then ProtagonistA's whole body tensed up and froze . ProtagonistA could n't take another step . ProtagonistA tried again and again , but it was as if ProtagonistA 'd run into an invisible barrier . ProtagonistA's eyes widened in shock . Could it be ? < nl > ProtagonistA gestured to ProtagonistB . Was ProtagonistA miming ? ProtagonistA spoke quickly and gruffly , trying to conceal the panic in ProtagonistA's voice .  ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB go in first .  ProtagonistB raised ProtagonistB's eyebrows at ProtagonistA , wondering what ProtagonistA was playing at . But ProtagonistB acquiesced , and took a step towards the mouth of the new cavern . Then another , and another , effortlessly gliding through the invisible barrier that had stopped ProtagonistA in ProtagonistA's tracks . < nl > ProtagonistA furrowed ProtagonistA's brows , ProtagonistA's mind reeling in shock . This was someone 's * home * ? ProtagonistA could n't enter , not without permission . An unfortunate side - effect of being a vampire , certainly , but not one ProtagonistA had expected to encounter * here * . As ProtagonistA stood there , ProtagonistA heard a loud noise , rocks crashing in the distance , and a warm blast of wind shooting out from the depths of the cave . Something was * stirring * . < nl > A primal fear emerged from the deepest part of ProtagonistA's mind . Every cell in ProtagonistA's body was screaming ' * danger * ' . Without warning , a roar blasted out from deep within the cave , a roar that sounded monstrous . No , monstrous was an understatement . It sounded ...   * draconic * . < nl >  WHO DARES INTRUDE ON MY TERRITORY !  a voice bellowed , followed by a loud sniff .  I SMELL HUMANS ... AND A VAMPIRE ? HAS YOUR RACE FORGOTTEN THE LESSON I TAUGHT THEM ALL THOSE YEARS AGO ?  < nl > ProtagonistA swallowed hard , and turned around .  What are you waiting for ?

< sos > * Freak . * < nl > * Retard . * < nl > ProtagonistA first found out ProtagonistA was different when ProtagonistA was seven . ProtagonistB , stood in the sun , the light perfectly accentuating ProtagonistB's toned muscles . < nl >  Now , kids ,  ProtagonistB said ,  You might 've all been born with the best genes out there , but if you do n't exercise properly those muscles will become smaller and weaker , and you do n't want that . Today , we 're gon na do chin - ups . It 's easy . You just walk underneath the bar , hold your arms out like this , and pull until your chin is above the bar . Of course , you 'll be using this lower bar here . Now , line up and show ProtagonistB what you can do .  < nl > We lined up gingerly . < nl >  ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistB said ,  One , two , three ... Come on , ProtagonistC can do this , one more ... Yes ! Four . Well done .  < nl >  Charlotte , come on up , do n't be shy . One , two , three , four , five , six ! Great job .  < nl >  Emma .  < nl > ProtagonistA walked up to the bar . ProtagonistA was just a bit too short and had to tip ProtagonistA's toes to reach it . As soon as ProtagonistA began to pull , ProtagonistA's arms felt like they had been injected with the world 's most potent hot sauce . ProtagonistA could imagine the muscle fibres , burning , tearing . The sun stung sharply into ProtagonistA's skin . < nl >  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA can do this . ProtagonistB believe in ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB said . < nl > ProtagonistA let go . < nl >  Do n't give up . Try again . Come on !  ProtagonistB said ,  In all ProtagonistB's years of teaching ProtagonistB have never seen someone fail to do a chin - up .  < nl >  ProtagonistB do n't get it . ProtagonistA 's * special * !  ProtagonistD said , with ProtagonistD's usual impeccable smile . Oh , how ProtagonistA hated that smile . < nl > ProtagonistB's face fell .  Do n't worry , we can assign ProtagonistA to the special PE class . There 's nothing to be afraid of .  < nl > * * * < nl > Being in the special PE class meant no one would sit with you at lunch . It meant your friends would n't be your friends anymore . It meant ProtagonistD would find you at your weakest moment and break you further . < nl >  ProtagonistA 're a freak just like ProtagonistE !  ProtagonistD had said to ProtagonistA at lunch , just after that dreaded PE class . < nl > A teacher overheard ProtagonistD .  ProtagonistD must never , never say that to another person . Apologize . Now .  < nl >  ProtagonistD 'm sorry .  ProtagonistD said . Who could overlook ProtagonistD's innocent smile and think ProtagonistD was being insincere ? < nl > But ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistD was n't . ProtagonistA could tell . ProtagonistA just knew . < nl > To be honest , ProtagonistA did n't understand why ProtagonistF fell for ProtagonistE back then . ProtagonistF came from a well - positioned family , was good looking , smart and genetically enhanced for a long life . ProtagonistE was a scrawny kid who wore clothes two sizes too big because it was the only size ProtagonistE could find , and ProtagonistE did n't have any modifications either . < nl > It would n't be until high school when ProtagonistA would find out . < nl > * * * < nl > High school was different . Classes were sorted based on the genetic modifications you received . But they did n't know what to do with ProtagonistA , so they just shoved ProtagonistA in whatever random class they pleased . ProtagonistA was the girl no one wanted to deal with . < nl > But the classes all assumed prior abilities from your modifications . It was simply the norm . As a result , ProtagonistA was never the model student in class , always catching up . ProtagonistA dreaded the day when grades would come out . No , not because of Mom , who 'd been too depressed to care ever since ProtagonistE died , ironically , from cancer caused by one of ProtagonistE's genes that could 've been modified when ProtagonistE was born . No , ProtagonistA feared the day because of ProtagonistD . < nl > * * * < nl > It came anyway . < nl >  ProtagonistD did n't know how someone can be ugly and dumb at the same time . ProtagonistA really * are * special .  ProtagonistD said . ProtagonistD's gang all laughed at ProtagonistD's joke . It was a weak joke and they knew it . They just needed someone to laugh at . < nl >  You know , ProtagonistE deserved to die . It 's called * evolution * . Look it up , if ProtagonistD could even understand it .  ProtagonistD's friend erupted in laughter again . < nl > Too far . Way too far . < nl > ProtagonistA's hands forming a fist , reaching out . ProtagonistD jumped back . ProtagonistD was too fast and ProtagonistD's reaction time unhuman , thanks to ProtagonistD's modifications . < nl >  So ProtagonistA wanna fight , huh ? Come at ProtagonistD . Come on .  ProtagonistD said , knowing ProtagonistA was n't as strong as ProtagonistD . < nl > ProtagonistA's mind raced . * ProtagonistA 'd never win against ProtagonistD in a fair fight , ProtagonistA know that . What should ProtagonistA do ? What would ProtagonistD do ? ProtagonistD would come charging straight at ProtagonistA , would n't ProtagonistD ? Yes . That 's what ProtagonistD 'd do . And ProtagonistD would n't look down either , no , ProtagonistD would n't . * < nl > ProtagonistA tensed , sticking out ProtagonistA's foot at the right moment as ProtagonistD fell to the ground . What ProtagonistA did n't expect was how quickly ProtagonistD 'd get up . < nl > * * * < nl > On that night ProtagonistA walked home covered in purple bruises . As ProtagonistA opened the door ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistF's mouth open . < nl >  My God , what happened to ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistA ... ProtagonistA ...  < nl >  ProtagonistF , why did ProtagonistF choose ProtagonistE ? Why not anyone else ?  < nl >  Oh , ProtagonistF told ProtagonistE this day would come . ProtagonistF told ProtagonistE and ProtagonistE told ProtagonistF to show ProtagonistA something . Come .  ProtagonistF led ProtagonistA upstairs to ProtagonistF's room . < nl >  Here .  ProtagonistF handed ProtagonistA an article . Printed , marked with small letters on the margins . ProtagonistE's handwriting . A passage was highlighted in yellow . < nl > > Without a doubt , genetic editing had done a great service to mankind . However , it is not without its downsides . First and foremost , we possess the technology necessary to enhance certain traits by a large degree . While this helps to cement the trait , it also interferes with the person 's natural development , as the trait is too concrete in his or her genetic code for the individual to go against it , making the individual extremely predictable . Secondly , it is understood that the genetic code does not work on a basis of traits . Changing one trait may result in another trait being inadvertently changed in the process , leading to side effects to every modification known to man ... < nl > ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistF wipe away at a tear .  It 's okay .  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA 'm okay .  < nl > * * * < nl > It had been a while since ProtagonistD had pestered ProtagonistA . ProtagonistD seemed to have a lot more respect after ProtagonistA tripped ProtagonistD . No , not respect , but fear . < nl > At lunch , ProtagonistA sat alone , researching genetic modifications on ProtagonistA's tablet . It was fascinating . ProtagonistA 've been researching for the last twelve days and ProtagonistA was still learning new things . < nl > ProtagonistA being silent seemed to trick ProtagonistD into a sense of security . ProtagonistA heard those familiar footsteps , saw that familiar smile .  Hey ProtagonistA , how 's it going ?  ProtagonistD said , snatching ProtagonistA's tablet away . < nl >  Oh , look guys , it looks like ProtagonistA wants to be pretty ! Well , guess what , too bad .  ProtagonistD showed ProtagonistD's friends as they laughed . < nl > ProtagonistA was laughing too , on the inside . Because ProtagonistA could guess the modifications ProtagonistD received . And out of those , ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistD had three important modifications : IN-2 , which causes a lack of awareness of the surrounding environment , CH-7 , which reduces critical thinking , and ST-5 , which causes a person to follow instructions blindly . < nl > ProtagonistD would n't be laughing after ProtagonistD suddenly finds ProtagonistD having walked into the principal 's office . < eos > 
< sos >  The Antichrist !  ProtagonistA said and clacked ProtagonistA's hooves together .  It 's finally time !  < nl > ProtagonistB rolled ProtagonistB's eyes , ProtagonistB's tattered black wings slouching on ProtagonistB back .  That 's your solution for everything , is n't it ? Just rain chaos upon the world .  < nl >  That 's hardly fair - the apocalypse takes planning , precision ... finesse . * Finesse * !  The fires flared to emphasize ProtagonistA's words .  Chaos implicates randomness - this is far from it . Seriously , ProtagonistA do n't get why you guys do n't want to try * Revelation ... *  < nl >  While the end of the world would certainly get people 's attention , it would also mean the end of all amusement ,  said the Devil absently , busy polishing his horns .  What we need is something ingenious ... something * fiendish . * I suggest dream visitation ... nightmares ... deceit ... trickery ... bring them all down here ... then we can tell them in person !  < nl >  That 's weak !  ProtagonistA roared .  ProtagonistA hate weak ! ProtagonistA want to see things burning !  < nl > The Ninth Circle fell silent for a while , save for the pathetic whimpering of the poor souls stuck in the ice . ProtagonistB tilted ProtagonistB's head to the side , regarding the others . ProtagonistB did n't deserve to be here like the other two - even after all these years , it felt unjust . Breaking out had always been ProtagonistB's number one priority . ProtagonistB knew now that ProtagonistB could n't do it alone , and getting these two in the same room had n't been easy . < nl >  Listen ,  ProtagonistB finally said and took a few nimble steps up to the brimstone table ,  if we do n't work together we 'll get nowhere . We want out , and we want to show them we 're not the same person - those are our goals .  < nl > The Devil put his glass to his red lips and swirled the liquid in his mouth .  I still have n't heard ProtagonistB's plan .  < nl >  There 's no * ProtagonistB * ; there 's only * ours * . And right now we 've got squat .  < nl > The Devil flipped a cigarette between his claws .  Well ... there 's something I have n't told you before ; I actually know the way out of here . But we still need to come up with a way to distinguish ourselves .  < nl >  What the hell did you just say ?  ProtagonistA rose to ProtagonistA's full height , ProtagonistA's silhouette crackling with flames . < nl > ProtagonistB crossed ProtagonistB's arms and looked darkly at the Devil . < nl >  While you 've been tempting people and giving them false promises ... and while ProtagonistA 's been stomping around , causing havoc , ProtagonistB 've been extracting information from our dear population ... ProtagonistB can get us out , but you need to tell ProtagonistB how we 're going to make people see us for who we really are .  < nl >  This is unacceptable ! ProtagonistA could 've blown things up a long time ago !  ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA's voice quaking .  And to think that all this time ProtagonistB had ProtagonistA's sympathy ... The Rolling Stones actually had ProtagonistA fooled ! SAD .  < nl > ProtagonistB made ProtagonistB's way over to the Devil and put ProtagonistB's lips to his ear .  Is there any way we can leave ProtagonistA here ?  < nl >  Sorry , ProtagonistB . Opening the portal requires all three of us . Now , do ProtagonistB have a plan or not ?  < nl >  Fine ,  ProtagonistB said .  Here 's ProtagonistB's idea . We 'll take on the guise of powerful people . And through them , we 'll present ourselves as different individuals . We wo n't be our mythological selves ... but our ideals will remain the same .  < nl >  It could work ,  the Devil said . < nl >  Yes !  ProtagonistA rumbled .  Let 's go already !  < nl >  What 's my name ?  the Devil sang . < nl >  Putin .  < nl >  What 's ProtagonistA's name ?  ProtagonistA said . < nl >  Trump .  < nl >  And yours ?  they both said at the same time . < nl >  Please allow me to introduce myself ; I 'm a man of wealth and taste ...  ProtagonistB sang along .  My name is Elon Musk .  < eos > 
< sos > They had made up names for ProtagonistA .  The Grim Reaper  was ProtagonistA's favorite ; that one came with its own mythology . The story went that when it was a human 's time to go , they 'd see manifestations of ProtagonistA , coming to collect their souls and escort them to the afterlife . The black robe and scythe had become very much a part of ProtagonistA's iconography , and ProtagonistA had embraced that . In reality , the scythe was the favored weapon of ProtagonistA's people , and the black robe just made ProtagonistA feel cool . Humans knew , of course , that it was logically impossible for ProtagonistA to collect * every * dying human soul , but they ascribed that to the supernatural , something they tended to do with most things they did n't have the capacity to explain . < nl > The truth was that human souls were delicious . The mundanity of the real reason ProtagonistA was hunting that day was almost funny to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA spent most of ProtagonistA's time on Earth , though occasionally ProtagonistA would share ProtagonistA's kill with ProtagonistA's brothers and sisters throughout the galaxy . < nl > Tonight , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA in a city that humans called Oss - tin . It was   quite a lively city , and it was a night that saw the streets of Oss - tin flooded with people . ProtagonistA scanned the street from atop a roof , assessing the richness of the feast of souls set out before ProtagonistA . Humans were mostly frail , but in large groups , they could wreak havoc on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA needed to choose carefully . < nl > ProtagonistB stumbled out of a bar , filled with the libations that ProtagonistA understood this part of the city was famous for . ProtagonistB's aura glowed brightly . < nl > ProtagonistB was ripe . < nl > ProtagonistA waved a hand in front of ProtagonistA's face , transforming what would be a ghastly appearance to any human into a pleasant , charming face . The idea was to lure ProtagonistB into one of Oss - tin 's many alleys and side streets , striking ProtagonistB down while ProtagonistB was alone . ProtagonistA jumped down from the roof , landing in the roaring crowd without making a sound . < nl > ProtagonistA marched right up to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was going to be sick . ProtagonistA moved out of ProtagonistB's way just in time to watch ProtagonistB expel the contents of ProtagonistB's stomach out onto the street . A hand flew to ProtagonistA's mouth to keep ProtagonistA from laughing . ProtagonistA reached out to ProtagonistB . < nl >  Let ProtagonistA give ProtagonistB a hand .  ProtagonistB looked up at ProtagonistA , immediately taken with ProtagonistA's new guise , and slurred some form of assent . ProtagonistA draped ProtagonistB's arm over ProtagonistA's shoulder , guiding ProtagonistB to the alley beside the bar ProtagonistB 'd just fallen out of . Once ProtagonistA had determined they were sufficiently alone , ProtagonistA's disguise dissipated . ProtagonistB's face went completely white . < nl >  Oh , god . Oh , shit . Is this it ?  < nl > ProtagonistA nodded .  This is it . ProtagonistA can carry a message to ProtagonistB's family , if ProtagonistB 'd like .  ProtagonistA would do no such thing , but it typically calmed down ProtagonistA's prey enough to make ProtagonistA's job easy . < nl >  Just ... just tell ProtagonistB's parents ProtagonistB love them , and sorry ProtagonistB 'm such a fuck - up ...  ProtagonistB let out a choking sob , putting ProtagonistB's head in ProtagonistB's hands . ProtagonistA's heart fell . ProtagonistA always felt bad if they started crying . But ProtagonistA had a job to do . < nl >  ProtagonistA 'll tell them . Now kneel .  ProtagonistB did as ProtagonistB was told , and ProtagonistA raised ProtagonistA's scythe , bringing it down on ProtagonistB's neck . No cut was made , though a white mist began to seep from ProtagonistB's body . ProtagonistA opened a pouch ProtagonistA was carrying inside ProtagonistA's robe to collect it . The soul was rich in nutrients . < nl > ProtagonistA had done well . < eos > 
< sos > The last of the wooden planks was hammered into place as ProtagonistA dabbed at ProtagonistA's brow with the rags hanging from ProtagonistA's neck . It was hardly what one could call a temple . ProtagonistA had fashioned the crude wooden shrine ProtagonistA , carving and hammering the planks and poles with as much care as ProtagonistA could muster . Still , it looked unimpressive . The edges jutted out awkwardly , the pillars were uneven , and it had no fanciful decorations that one might expect at a proper shrine or temple . No garland of flowers hung from the flat roof of the shrine , no incense smoke trailed into the sky , and no prayers or prophecies were chanted . Most conspicuously , the spot where the idol of the god would sit- in the centre of the shrine- was empty . If this was a temple , it provided no clue as to which god it was meant for . < nl > And yet ProtagonistA was content , eager even . ProtagonistA had left the shrine unfurnished on purpose . Each temple or shrine was a home for a god , a resting place for the otherworldly , powerful beings that governed the laws of nature and weaved human fates with their fingertips . It was said that those who built these sanctuaries would receive a blessing from whichever god decided to take up residence there . Now , ProtagonistA simply hoped that there would be a deity willing to possess the modest temple that ProtagonistA 'd created . As ProtagonistA ambled off to sleep , ProtagonistA prayed for a suitable god or goddess- Demeter , maybe- to bless ProtagonistA , with bountiful harvests for the rest of ProtagonistA's days . < nl > The next day , ProtagonistA gingerly placed a bowl of rice in front of the shrine and knelt down . Unsure of what else to do , ProtagonistA mumbled  Gods or goddesses that be , please accept this humble sacrifice ,  and waited . A moment passed . ProtagonistA chuckled to ProtagonistA . Of course , no god would be willing to resign themselves to such a shabby place of worship . ProtagonistA 'd long been prepared for that outcome . ProtagonistA began to rise to ProtagonistA's feet . < nl > Then ProtagonistA heard it . ProtagonistA had to strain to make it out , but it sounded like someone was speaking to ProtagonistA . A faint voice , coming from the rickety wooden altar that ProtagonistA 'd fashioned . The voice was quiet , and sounded almost weak .  Child ,  it said ,  Thank you for the offering . ProtagonistB 'm afraid ProtagonistB ca n't do much for you now , but come back tomorrow . Perhaps then , ProtagonistB might be able to reward you .  < nl > ProtagonistA's eyes opened wide , as ProtagonistA almost fell over from surprise . ProtagonistA 'd never spoken to a god before . And yet , it was different from what ProtagonistA 'd expected . Were n't the gods meant to be mighty ? Powerful ? Then what was this tinny voice coming from the shrine ? ProtagonistA pushed the invasive thoughts out of ProtagonistA's mind . A god was a god , and it was best not to think disrespectful thoughts in front of them . ProtagonistA bowed deeply , and vowed to bring a better offering the next morning . < nl > This time , there was a bowl of rice , accompanied by a dish of meat and a glass of wine .  Gods or goddesses that be ,  ProtagonistA repeated ,  Please accept this humble sacrifice .  < nl > The voice that echoed out from the shrine was clearer than the day before , and ProtagonistA could now ascertain that it sounded female . A goddess ?  Thank you , child . It has been a long , long time since ProtagonistB have received an offering , and ProtagonistB was forced into hibernation until you sacrificed to ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB ca n't seem to remember who ProtagonistB am ; but ProtagonistB remember ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC's name was ... Demeter ? ProtagonistB am sorry child , if you do n't mind coming back tomorrow , perhaps ProtagonistB will have regained enough strength to remember by identity .  < nl > Excitement thrilled through ProtagonistA's veins . A goddess related to ProtagonistC ? Perhaps ProtagonistA's simple wish really would come true , and ProtagonistA 'd see bountiful harvests for the rest of ProtagonistA's days . ProtagonistA quelled ProtagonistA's exhilaration , and waited patiently for the next morning . < nl > As usual , ProtagonistA left the sacrifice in front of the altar , and knelt down . The voice manifested once again , this time even clearer than before .  Child , ProtagonistB have remembered ,  ProtagonistB spoke . It was good news . *  Yet ProtagonistB does not sound happy ,  * ProtagonistA thought to ProtagonistA silently . ProtagonistB's voice was quavering slightly . Rage ? No , nothing like that . ProtagonistB sounded melancholic , almost , as if ProtagonistB had recalled something ProtagonistB would much rather have forgotten . < nl >  ProtagonistB's name is Limos ,  ProtagonistB said .  Child , thank you for the offerings . But ProtagonistB must go now .  < nl >  Why ?  ProtagonistA cried ,  Oh but ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB 've barely arrived ! Stay a while , at least , and wo n't ProtagonistB let ProtagonistA's crops grow well ? ProtagonistA wo n't ask for a lifetime of bountiful harvest , but would ProtagonistB at least help ProtagonistA this season ?  < nl > Though ProtagonistA could not see ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistB shake ProtagonistB's head , almost imperceptibly . And then , ProtagonistB was gone . < nl > Even when ProtagonistA brought the offerings the next morning , and the days after that , ProtagonistB never returned . < nl > * * * * * < nl > ProtagonistB faded away from the shrine , cutting away ProtagonistB's attachment from the temple that ProtagonistA had built . ProtagonistB shut ProtagonistB's eyes , and prepared to sleep again . This time , ProtagonistB did n't know when ProtagonistB would wake up . The faintest tear trickled down ProtagonistB's face before dissipating into a hazy light . ProtagonistB had been so happy when a mortal had called ProtagonistB , worshiped ProtagonistB , given ProtagonistB's offerings . It had been so long , after all . But then ProtagonistB 'd remembered who ProtagonistB was , * what * ProtagonistB was . < nl > ProtagonistB Looking at ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB knew that ProtagonistB could not stay . That was ProtagonistB's fate : ProtagonistB would only ever bring disaster to those who called ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB would be spurned , hated , cursed , and ultimately- forgotten . < nl > As ProtagonistB's consciousness faded away , ProtagonistB saw the faint image of a man kneeling in front of a clumsy , wooden shrine , food and wine in his outstretched hands . < nl > * * * * * < nl > * I write a story a day [ here](http://yearofpilgrimage.wordpress.com ) * < nl > * more stories at /r / chasing_mist * < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA struggled against the chains , ProtagonistA's naked body cold with sweat , ProtagonistA's eyes burning in feverish despair . The blindfold was soaked in ProtagonistA's tears . ProtagonistA heard them chant darkly around ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had seen the knife , the chalice , the circle of candles , and the pentagram on the floor . ProtagonistA tried to scream but the foul - tasting gag muffled ProtagonistA . < nl > Only this morning ProtagonistA had prepared ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's first day of high school . ProtagonistA was ready to meet ProtagonistA's new classmates - ready , but nervous . ProtagonistA had heard the van drive up behind ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA remembered thinking nothing of it . And then it was just blackness . < nl > ProtagonistA gasped as ProtagonistA felt cold steel run down ProtagonistA's thigh , and then the sting . Wet heat seeped down ProtagonistA's skin . < nl >  Oh , Dark One !  A deep voice said in maniacal ecstasy .  We offer you the blood of ProtagonistA ! Step forth !   Join us on this mortal plane . Take your throne ! The world is yours .  < nl > At first , there was nothing , but then the room shook . ProtagonistA could smell the mortar dust sailing down from the ceiling . ProtagonistA's stomach felt like ProtagonistA was on a roller coaster . Strange smells filled ProtagonistA's nostrils . Charcoal , rotten eggs , and melting iron . Then there was heat . < nl > ' * Open ProtagonistA's eyes , * ' ProtagonistB whispered in the back of ProtagonistA's mind . < nl > ProtagonistA took a deep breath . ProtagonistA could feel the heat on ProtagonistA's lips and in ProtagonistA's throat . ProtagonistA was no longer gagged . ProtagonistA sat up and opened ProtagonistA's eyes . < nl > The landscape before ProtagonistA was a waste of ashes and darkened mountains . Like the neon signs of an amusement park , rivers of flowing lava lit up the night . What the hell ... < nl > ' * That 's right . That 's exactly it . * ' < nl > ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head trying to rid ProtagonistA of the strange whispers , and at the same time make sense of ProtagonistA's surroundings . The ground beneath ProtagonistA's rumbled . In the far distance , a red flower bloomed over a mountain , and then the rock started bleeding . < nl >  Where am ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistA said , despite ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistA's voice was twisted and dark and sent a shiver down ProtagonistA's own spine . It was n't ProtagonistA's voice . < nl > ' * ProtagonistA 're in Hell , ProtagonistA . * ' < nl >  Who are you ? Am ProtagonistA dead ?  < nl > ProtagonistB let out a hushed chuckle . < nl > ' * Listen , ProtagonistA . Allow me to take ProtagonistA's soul , and I 'll put ProtagonistA right back in ProtagonistA's world . * ' < nl > ProtagonistA thought about ProtagonistA's parents and ProtagonistA's little sister ; ProtagonistA did want to see them again . This place was dead ; there was nothing for ProtagonistA here . Still , the room with the crazed cultists flickered in ProtagonistA's mind . ProtagonistA had been so scared . ProtagonistA did n't want to go back to that . < nl > ' * What are ProtagonistA going to do , huh ? * ' ProtagonistB said . ' * There 's nothing for ProtagonistA here . * ' < nl >  How do ProtagonistA know that ?  ProtagonistA growled , trying to stay unfazed by ProtagonistB's ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA 've only just got here .  < nl > ' * ProtagonistA can trust me , I 've been here for a very long time . There 's nothing but brimstone and suffering here . * ' < nl >  Are you Lucifer ?  < nl > ProtagonistB laughed in the back of ProtagonistA's mind but did n't respond . ProtagonistA looked at ProtagonistA's hand . It was covered in red scales with claws sprouting from ProtagonistA's fingertips . Carefully , ProtagonistA touched ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA's nose had a strange shape , almost like a snout , and when ProtagonistA moved ProtagonistA's head around it felt heavy . < nl >  You 're not getting ProtagonistA's soul until you tell ProtagonistA what 's going on .  < nl > ' * That little cult tried to summon ProtagonistA - it happens . But they were clever this time , very ... * * * specific * * * about what ProtagonistA could and could n't do . ProtagonistA was supposed to be bound to your mortal form ... they wanted power over ProtagonistA . They were clever . ProtagonistA 'll give them that . But there is always a loophole . ProtagonistA reversed the ritual , and now you 're here . You possess ProtagonistA . * ' < nl >  I possess ProtagonistA ?  < nl > ' * Yes , quite ironic is n't it ? ProtagonistA kind of enjoy having you in there though ... it 's refreshing . But ProtagonistA like ProtagonistA said , ProtagonistA can send you back ... at the cost of ProtagonistA's soul , of course . * ' < nl >  Nope .  < nl > ProtagonistB snorted . ' * What do ProtagonistA mean , ' nope ? ' * ' < nl >  ProtagonistA lied . You 're not getting ProtagonistA's soul .  < nl > ProtagonistA took a few steps . ProtagonistA's feet were massive hooves and the ground puffed ash . ProtagonistA left a trail of burning hoof prints in ProtagonistA's wake . < nl > ' * I like ProtagonistA . * ' ProtagonistB carried a combination of anger and stark amusement . < nl >  ProtagonistA do n't care ,  ProtagonistA said and tried out the massive wings on ProtagonistA's back . < nl > ProtagonistA wanted to get back home , but maybe ProtagonistA could enjoy ProtagonistA for a while first . ProtagonistA 'd always wanted to fly . < nl > ' * The only way back ... is you giving me your soul . * ' < nl >  ProtagonistA do n't know . If you got in here somehow , there has to be a way out .  < nl > Now ProtagonistB went into full - blown laughter . < nl >  What ? It 's only logical .  < nl > ' * There is a way out . ProtagonistB 'll show it to ProtagonistA . * ' < nl >  And what , the price is ProtagonistA's freaking soul ?  < nl > ' * Oh no , this one is on the house . Maybe then ProtagonistA 'll better grasp the concept of eternal damnation . * ' < nl >  Whatever . Just tell ProtagonistA where it is ,  ProtagonistA said and rolled ProtagonistA's eyes . < nl > ' * Follow the stream . * ' < nl >  Which one ?  < nl > ' * Any . They all lead to the same place . * ' < nl > * * * < nl > ProtagonistA stomped along the dead plains , following a smoldering river . ProtagonistA tried to fly a few times , but ProtagonistA's lack of coordination made ProtagonistA's crash . ProtagonistA 'd always been a bit clumsy , and piloting this body was much harder than ProtagonistA's own . < nl > Finally , ProtagonistA reached the foot of a massive volcano . Lava boiled down its sides , spreading into a burning spider web over the strange landscape . ProtagonistA took a deep breath and tried to control ProtagonistA's limbs . Arms . Legs . Tail . Wings . Lots of things to keep track of . Kind of like operating one of ProtagonistA's dad 's excavators . < nl > ProtagonistA's massive thighs strained , and ProtagonistA somehow managed to push ProtagonistA off the ground , catching ProtagonistA with the big wings . ProtagonistA flapped them desperately , and somehow ProtagonistA rose . < nl > ' * Not bad , * ' ProtagonistB said . < nl > After a bit of a struggle , ProtagonistA managed to gain some sort of control . The massive body drifted through the air . ProtagonistA felt ProtagonistA's mouth twist into a toothy grin . But as much as ProtagonistA enjoyed the tingly sensation in the pit of ProtagonistA's scaly stomach , ProtagonistA wanted to get back home . < nl > Landing on the rim of the volcano 's top was far from easy . ProtagonistA crashed inelegantly into a heap . ProtagonistA 'd have to practice that . < nl > The interior of the mountain was a massive red lake . < nl > ' * This is where we put some of the sinners , * ' ProtagonistB said and chuckled . ' * Swim across , ProtagonistA , swim across ! They never make it very far . * ' < nl > ProtagonistA noticed tiny black dots right below ProtagonistA . They were all people , screaming and trying to claw their way out . < nl >  So , how do ProtagonistA get out ?  ProtagonistA said , trying to keep ProtagonistA's voice steady . < nl > ' * At the middle . * ' < nl > ProtagonistA was n't super excited about flying over an open lake of lava , but ProtagonistA still jumped into the air . It went better this time . Gliding across the screaming billions , ProtagonistA saw a dark shape jutting out of all the red , like a small leaf floating in a bowl of tomato soup . < nl > ProtagonistC sat cross - legged and naked on the steaming rock . < nl >  Hey , who are ProtagonistC ?  ProtagonistA said , landing with a thud ,  and how do ProtagonistA get out of here ?  < nl > ProtagonistC lifted ProtagonistC's graying head . ProtagonistC's eyes were clogged with ashes , and ProtagonistC's lips black and chapped . For a moment , ProtagonistC appeared scared , but then ProtagonistC tilted ProtagonistC's head to the side . < nl >  ProtagonistA 're ... new ,  ProtagonistC muttered .  Have ProtagonistA come to torture ProtagonistC ?  < nl >  No , ProtagonistA want to leave ! Which way is out ?  < nl >  Are ProtagonistA sure ?  < nl >  Yes !  < nl >  Okay ...  ProtagonistC spread ProtagonistC's filthy fingers into a claw , and grated them over the sharp rocks , cringing from the pain . < nl > A trail of bubbling blood soon formed a circle on the ground . ProtagonistC shook ProtagonistC's head . < nl >  Just step into the circle ,  ProtagonistC mumbled . < nl > ProtagonistA was about to do as ProtagonistA was told , but then a thought struck ProtagonistA . ProtagonistC did n't deserve to suffer here after being so helpful . ProtagonistA was going to bring ProtagonistC along . And with a flick of ProtagonistA's massive wrist , ProtagonistA snatched ProtagonistC up . ProtagonistC let out a shrill scream of horror , kicking and wriggling to get free . < nl >  Let 's go home ,  ProtagonistA said and stepped into the glowing circle . < nl > ProtagonistA felt the air pulsating around ProtagonistA , and a strange pressure pushed on ProtagonistA's shoulders . < nl > ' * I lied too , * ' the voice inside ProtagonistA's head said and laughed . ' * There 's only down from here . * ' < nl > * * * < nl > r / Lilwa_Dexel < eos > 
< sos > * Emergence * < nl > ' Location unknown . Location unknown . Location unknown , ' the traversal shuttle 's intercom announced again and again in its warm , clipped tones as a warning light repeatedly bathed the cabin in crimson light . < nl > ProtagonistA breathed out , closing ProtagonistA's eyes and clenching ProtagonistA's fists as ProtagonistA endured the last waves of traversal shock . The mindless iteration of evolution had never anticipated humanity would leave its cradle , let alone transmit itself nigh - instantaneously across the cosmos . Traversal , then , the means with which homo sapiens had made a laughing stock of the vastness of the void , was something the biological brain was singularly discomforted by . < nl > Black , abyssal depths , condensed nebulae clouds and frozen suns hanging in a paralyzed cosmos were the sights available to anyone stupid enough to look out of a viewport mid - traversal . The visions of a creationist God , democratised all the way down to family tourism and long haul work commutes . < nl > ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's eyes for a brief moment , long enough to experience pure agony as the strobing light bloomed directly in front of ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA snarled , punching out blindly with the armoured knuckles of ProtagonistA's voidskin and being rewarded with the sharp * crack * of plastic . < nl > ' Passenger consciousness detected , ' the capsule 's voice intoned , ' please remain calm . Location is unknown . Manual input requested . ' There was a faint click as a screen dropped into ProtagonistA's vision , emerging seamlessly from the featureless black of the capsule 's interior . < nl > ' ProtagonistA suppose ProtagonistA do n't get a discount for teaching the capsule what a planet looks like ? ' ProtagonistA asked sarcastically , idly waving at the screen to activate it . Most corporate capsules were the same . Dumb . Drop out of traversal sideways and then ask the passenger what the destination should look like levels of dumb . < nl > The screen blinked on , briefly displayed the skull and crossed missiles of some two bit shipping firm , then clicked into an endless cascade of flashing red astronomic errors . Dozens , then hundreds , then thousands . All pointing to one lunatic impossibility , laid out in stark characters before ProtagonistA's eyes . < nl > The stars had moved . < nl > ProtagonistA swallowed a searing , panicked breath and pushed ProtagonistA's restraint - seat away from the glaring screen . The capsule 's primary viewport was a small circle of hardened armourglass to ProtagonistA's left , flickering with intermittent flashes of light from the void outside . < nl > ProtagonistA's voidskin detected the adrenaline rush as ProtagonistA stared at the planet below and reacted automatically , sprouting an armoured double - layer of interlocking plates from its matte black surface . ProtagonistA scarcely noticed . ProtagonistA's face was locked in a crazed rictus , a slight twitch to ProtagonistA's eyes , all blood fled to leave ProtagonistA utterly pale . < nl > A thousand thousand unknown ships , bearing symbols in no human language , hanging in an inhuman sky . < nl > ( Fun little exercise , but ProtagonistA 'm at work so ProtagonistA 'll stop . ) < eos > 
< sos > The President of the United States , who was - at that time - a rather sensible lady who wore sensible shoes and did sensible things like Wednesday morning yoga and not killing poor people , had just taken up a phone call with ProtagonistA . < nl > They were supposed to be talking about Iceland , which had gotten rather full of itself on account of sounding like a dreary place but actually being quite a lovely place . In those days it was encouraged that you acted how everyone suspected you should act , and not be clever and full of natural hot springs and other such nonsense . In fact , here was a good example of that - as news came in just as the call began that Australia had gone and done something almost unreasonably Australian . < nl >  Is that so ?  said ProtagonistA , upon hearing the news that Australia - as a continent - had flown off into the inky depths of space to face down an invading alien force .  Were they pissed , d'ya think ?  < nl >  When are they not ?  said ProtagonistA .  Always running around , punching kangaroos and drinking Fosters .... which is a ... *beer * , ProtagonistA believe ?  < nl >  Aye , ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistA .  Supposedly .  < nl >  Well , ProtagonistA 'd know them better than ProtagonistA ,  said ProtagonistA .  Do ProtagonistA think they 'll win ?  < nl >  Certainly - they 've got English blood in their DNA ,  said ProtagonistA . < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm not sure that 's how DNA works ,  said ProtagonistA , leaning back in ProtagonistA's chair to stare up at the blue sky . ProtagonistA thought , perhaps , just perhaps , ProtagonistA could spot a black speck in the distance .  Better question might be , when did they turn their continent into a spaceship ? That 's not exactly a weekend project .  < nl > ProtagonistA belched , then lowered the phone and cussed out Glinda , who was supposed to be taking orders , but was just talking on ProtagonistA's cellphone . ProtagonistB nodded .  Who 're talkin ' to * now * ?  ProtagonistB asked . < nl >  None'r'ya fuck all ,  snapped ProtagonistA , tossing back and forth a volley of rude gestures with ProtagonistB before picking up the phone .  Who can understand the mind of an Aussie ? They have spiders with thumbs there , d'ya know that ? Drive anyone insane .  < nl > ProtagonistA clucked ProtagonistA's tongue .  ProtagonistA do n't suppose they were planning on invading , do ProtagonistA ?  < nl >  Invading what ?  < nl >  You . Or us . Maybe Iceland ...  < nl >  Nah ,  said ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA overthinking again , ProtagonistA . There 's no sense to anything to do with the Aussies . You ever seen the giant Banana - person show ? Who 's * that * for ? ProtagonistC , that 's who . ProtagonistC turned the whole place into a warship because that seemed like the thing to do at the time . ProtagonistC flew off inta space because it seemed like a laugh . ProtagonistC 'll either die , or win , or make a bunch of new alien mates up there , then ProtagonistC 'll come back , have a nice nap , little hair of the dog , and it 's back to boogieboards and flying snakes and whatever the fuck else happens in that beautiful hellhole .  < nl > ProtagonistB was snapping ProtagonistB's fingers and Glinda was nowhere to be seen .  ProtagonistA suppose we 'll take up on Iceland another time , eh ProtagonistA ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA suppose ,  said ProtagonistA , still troubled .  You know ProtagonistA always appreciate ProtagonistA's wise counsel .  < nl >  Aye ,  said ProtagonistA .  Fucking Yoda over here .  < nl > ProtagonistA smiled , then hung up the phone . ProtagonistA would just have to wait . That was all . The Australians would do as the Australians would do . All ProtagonistA could do was have faith . < nl > ProtagonistD , had been standing inside the door the entire time , waiting patiently . < nl >  Yes , ProtagonistD ,  said ProtagonistA .  Let me guess - the Defense Secretary wants an emergency trillion dollars for intergalactic cruise missiles ? Am I close ?  < nl > ProtagonistD's head went slightly sideways .  Ah , a * little * ? Just wanted to let ProtagonistA know that New Zealand , Papua New Guinea , and Indonesia have all been ... uh ... incinerated .  < nl >  Oh my god !  cried ProtagonistA , rising from ProtagonistA's chair .  The aliens attacked ? Already ? I thought ...  < nl >  No , no ,  said ProtagonistD .  It 's uh ... ProtagonistD guess it take a lot of * thrust * to break an entire continent out of orbit .  < nl > ProtagonistA slowly sank back down .  Oh .  < nl >  Yeah ,  said ProtagonistD .  We 've got massive tsunamis heading toward Hawaii and all across southeast Asia .  < nl >  Oh .  < nl >  Right .  < nl >  So ... this was * not * a good idea ?  < nl > ProtagonistD nodded .  It ... does not appear to have been .  < nl >  Well ,  said ProtagonistA , turning back toward the window .  Lesson for the future , ProtagonistA guess . Do n't turn continents into spaceships .  < nl >  ProtagonistD 'll write that down somewhere ,  said ProtagonistD , letting ProtagonistD out of the room . < nl > ProtagonistA could swear ProtagonistA could see that speck on the horizon .  ProtagonistD do that .  < eos > 
< sos > The first flecks of dawn 's light trickled into the fancy high - rise bar . All was quiet except for the subtle squeaking of glasses being cleaned by ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA worked mechanically , with no life in ProtagonistA's movements . ProtagonistA did n't even flinch as the rear door slammed open and noise flooded the room . < nl > A terrifying assortment of gruesome creatures poured into the bar from the door as though through the gates of hell itself accompanied by a cacophony of growls , hisses , and moans that one could almost mistake as laughter . A towering figure with twisting horns and cruel claws approached the counter first , gingerly taking a seat and smiling at ProtagonistA with a mouth of wickedly pointed teeth . < nl >  Mornin ' ProtagonistA ! We had a great night , a round for everyone on me !  the monster proclaimed to cheers from his comrades . < nl >  Coming right up ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said quietly , moving to fill the order without a hint of fear , or any other emotion for that matter . < nl > ProtagonistB's smile faltered as ProtagonistB looked at ProtagonistA curiously , noticing the tear streaks leading from ProtagonistA's dead brown eyes . < nl >  Hey hey ,  ProtagonistB said , ProtagonistB's voice now as gentle as it could be with its rumbling timbre .  There 's something eating ProtagonistA ProtagonistA . What 's wrong ? Can we help ?  < nl > The bar quieted as the others began noticing ProtagonistA's distress . It seemed for a moment that ProtagonistA would remain quiet , but soon ProtagonistA opened up , ProtagonistA's voice quivering .  ProtagonistA - ProtagonistA ... It 's ProtagonistA's kids . Some people took them . They 're demanding a ten million dollar ransom delivered to them somewhere in that old abandoned neighborhood down Hollis St within a day if ProtagonistA ever want to see ProtagonistA's kids again . They said they 'd disappear if they saw even a hint of the police . ProtagonistA's husband is out trying to see if we can even get a loan that big . We do n't even have anything close to that kind of money ! Why ProtagonistA ? What can ProtagonistA do ! ?  ProtagonistA had thought ProtagonistA cried out , but found new tears forming as ProtagonistA let it out . < nl > The shocking assortment of creatures looked at one another in shock , each wondering who could be so cruel . ProtagonistB leaned over the counter and grabbed ProtagonistA in a bear hug that ProtagonistA melted into eagerly . After a moment ProtagonistB released ProtagonistA , leaning back with a dangerous gleam in ProtagonistB's eyes . < nl >  Fella 's , looks like that drink will have to wait , we 've got overtime to do .  ProtagonistB said as ProtagonistB began stomping towards the door they had entered through . < nl > ProtagonistA looked after ProtagonistB in surprise ,  what are ProtagonistB going to do ?  < nl > ProtagonistB paused , looking back at ProtagonistA with a gentle fierceness ,  what we do best . Find those kids .  < nl > ---------- < nl > ProtagonistC leaned against the wall of the shabby house twirling a butterfly knife with boredom . ProtagonistC glanced over at the two kids tied in the corner , reassuring ProtagonistC they were still here . By the terror on their faces , ProtagonistC could tell they should n't be a problem , but ProtagonistC really needed this to go smoothly . Hopefully ProtagonistA would n't do anything stupid like bring in the police , then they 'd never have their payday , and ProtagonistC might have to deal with those kids which would be unpleasant . < nl > ProtagonistD , looked up at ProtagonistC nervously ,  ProtagonistC , are ProtagonistC sure ProtagonistA 's good for it ? This is an awful risk . What if ProtagonistA has mob connections ?  < nl > ProtagonistC rolled ProtagonistC's eyes at ProtagonistD .  Of course ProtagonistA is idiot . That bar of ProtagonistA is fancy as hell , but it 's practically never open , it 's definitely a front for something . Plus , ProtagonistA 's way too squeaky clean to be with the mob . No , this is some white collar shady business . That kind of money is probably pocket change to ProtagonistA . We 'll get our payout and disappear to some quiet island somewhere , just chill out .  < nl > ProtagonistD shifted nervously ,  if ProtagonistC say so . Something about all this just gives ProtagonistD a bad feeling .  < nl >  Oh so ProtagonistD 're a jedi now ? Shut it and keep watch , this will be over soon ,  ProtagonistC snapped at ProtagonistD . < nl > ProtagonistC glanced back at the kids and saw them still where ProtagonistC 'd left them . Had that closet door been cracked before ? Probably , maybe ProtagonistC was a little jumpy after all . ProtagonistC grinned to ProtagonistC . With the creaking of this old building ProtagonistC could almost imagine they were footsteps behind ProtagonistC and that those shadows in the corners were alive . < nl > ProtagonistC squinted . Hold on , did that shadow just move ? < nl > Before ProtagonistC could take another breath , the room exploded into motion around ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC saw shadows move for sure this time . Scales , claws , tentacles , feathers , slime , fur , horns , and teeth were all in a sudden whirlwind about ProtagonistC as ProtagonistC was hit from multiple angles at once . In an instant ProtagonistC was on ProtagonistC's back in tremendous pain and with the breath knocked out of ProtagonistC . Leaning over ProtagonistC was a terrifying visage of twisted horns , wicked teeth , and blue fur leering at ProtagonistC with eyes in which ProtagonistC could see ProtagonistC's death reflected . ProtagonistC tried to let out what would have been the most primal scream of terror of ProtagonistC's life , but there was no air in ProtagonistC's lungs to release . < nl > The figure spoke in a quiet growl that sent shivers down ProtagonistC's spine .  ProtagonistC are lucky we do n't kill anyone these days , but if ProtagonistC ever think of hurting a child again , I 'll make an exception for ProtagonistC . We can find ProtagonistC no matter where ProtagonistC run . Nowhere is safe from us .  < nl > ProtagonistC thought ProtagonistC could hear sirens in the distance and ProtagonistC's head fell to the side as ProtagonistC began to lose consciousness from terror , shock , and lack of air . The last thing ProtagonistC saw was the kids , now unbound , hugging a huge green eyeball . < nl > ----------- < nl > ProtagonistA looked up from the bar to twin shrieks of joy proclaiming ,  ProtagonistA ! !  < nl > ProtagonistA embraced ProtagonistA's children fiercely as they ran to ProtagonistA , tears of relief and joy spilling down ProtagonistA's cheeks , for the moment paying no heed to the menagerie of monsters filing in from the broom closet . < nl > After a while ProtagonistA stood and beckoned to ProtagonistB ,  come here ProtagonistB .  < nl > The two shared an embrace and ProtagonistA whispered to ProtagonistB ,  thanks ProtagonistB .  < nl >  Anything for ProtagonistA ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB said warmly . < nl > ProtagonistA stepped back and smiled at the gathered crowd , then walked around behind the bar again .  Thank you all so much . Order up , Monsters Inc drinks free today !  < eos > 
< sos > Deep in the wood sat a cabin glowing like a candle in the darkness . The wind clutched at it , rattled the windows as if begging to come inside . But the windows stayed shut , and the house did not fall . < nl > Inside , ProtagonistA and ProtagonistB sat up late , reading books . < nl > Every longing sigh of the wind drew ProtagonistA's eyes once more to the windows . To the shapes ProtagonistA imagined pacing out there beyond the safe halo of light . But ProtagonistA could see only the drawn curtain . If ProtagonistA moved it there would be only ProtagonistA's own reflection , pooling back at ProtagonistA , unless ProtagonistA was brave enough to put ProtagonistA's nose right to the glass and squint out . < nl > ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA's stories about the things out there . ProtagonistA did not need to see them to believe ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA knew them by their three - clawed prints that circled their home like a moat every morning . By the gouges bored into the hide of ProtagonistB's woodshed , deeper than any bear 's mark . < nl > ProtagonistB caught ProtagonistA staring .  What have ProtagonistB always told ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistA stared mutely at the book until ProtagonistB answered for ProtagonistA ,  When the lights are on , we 're safe .  < nl > ProtagonistB gestured to the unflinching pupil of the light above , ProtagonistB's smile easy and light .  As ProtagonistA can see ,  ProtagonistB said ,  we 're safe .  < nl > ProtagonistA hid ProtagonistA's face in ProtagonistB's arm . ProtagonistA had lived eight years under the watchful guard of sunlight and filament . Darkness was nothingness . Darkness was death . < nl > So when ProtagonistA woke that night to a pitch - black room , ProtagonistA began to shriek . A hand stifled ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB's hand . ProtagonistB's other gripped ProtagonistA's wrist tightly , as if ProtagonistB was trying to tell ProtagonistA something through ProtagonistB's very bones .  ProtagonistB 'm going to go try the generator .  < nl >  But--  ProtagonistA said into ProtagonistB's fingertips . < nl > ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head .  It should have turned on , and it did n't .  < nl > The wind rattled at the roof like an angry god . < nl >  Someone has to go check it ,  ProtagonistB whispered , gently . Then ProtagonistB moved away , taking all the warmth and ProtagonistA's fleeting calm with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA bolted upright in bed , unsure if ProtagonistA should flee or hide . < nl > * Surely they know we 're in here * , ProtagonistA wanted to ask , but ProtagonistA could not give the life to the possibility by saying it aloud . < nl > ProtagonistB tossed a bundle at ProtagonistA .  Get dressed . Be silent . ProtagonistB love ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistB looked once over ProtagonistB's shoulder , at the flashlight beside the door . ProtagonistB handed it to ProtagonistA .  If they come inside , use this .  < nl > And then ProtagonistB opened the door . Blackness opening into blackness , broken only by a scattering of stars . Night quiet as perfect and unbroken as new snow . ProtagonistB looked back at ProtagonistA as ProtagonistB let the door shut behind ProtagonistB . < nl > ProtagonistA shoved ProtagonistA's fist into ProtagonistA's mouth to keep from sobbing . ProtagonistA had never seen a night so complete . < nl > Without the light , there was nothing to keep the monsters away . < nl > ProtagonistA scrambled to ProtagonistA's feet . As soundlessly as ProtagonistA could ProtagonistA wriggled into ProtagonistA's two warmest leggings and threw on ProtagonistA's largest pair of jeans over it . Sweaters , snow pants , socks thick as ProtagonistA's pinky . The mittens ProtagonistB knitted for ProtagonistA that summer while ProtagonistA watched ProtagonistB's needles click and the butterflies flitter and-- < nl > And a crunching , out there , beyond the door . A scuffle in the snow . < nl > ProtagonistA jammed ProtagonistA's feet into ProtagonistA's boots . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistA it was ProtagonistB . Had to be only ProtagonistA's father , panicked , in the dark . < nl > A howl shattered the night like dropped glass . A great bellow from beyond the pines , deep as the earth and older still . Another joined it , and another . Their calls were urgent , and coming closer . < nl > ProtagonistA threw ProtagonistA down instantly , unthinkingly , as if trying to make ProtagonistA invisible . And ProtagonistA froze there , rabbit in a burrow , listening . Stilling ProtagonistA's very heart . < nl > And then the creatures in the darkness went silent . There was only the cry of the wind , and faintly beneath it , the whine of the generator , as ProtagonistB struggled to make it go . < nl > ProtagonistA crawled on elbows and knees to the windows . The heavy plaid curtains were lashed together . ProtagonistA raised a shuddering hand to untie them . Scooted the corner back just far enough to peer around the corner . < nl > A pair of yellow eyes in a sea of matted black fur stared back at ProtagonistA , widened in delight when they met ProtagonistA . Its head was something between a wolf and a bear , but its eyes watched ProtagonistA knowingly , cleverly . As if it were waiting for ProtagonistA to look out and notice it . < nl > ProtagonistA tumbled back shrieking . < nl > The lights flared back to life overhead . < nl > And outside , ProtagonistB started screaming . < nl > ProtagonistA did not think . ProtagonistA ran to the bed and seized ProtagonistB's huge emergency flashlight . Stumbled into night for the first time in ProtagonistA's life . < nl > A hoard of black - coated creatures swarmed ProtagonistB's shed . Their teeth caught and gleamed in the light of the moon . One had ProtagonistB by the leg < nl > The outside lights were still dead . ProtagonistA fumbled with the flashlight , wrenched off a mitten , and flicked it on . Swung the beam toward the writhing mass of shapes . Smoke rose off their skin . They scattered screaming and hissing off ProtagonistB like water dropped in hot oil . ProtagonistB lay limp in the light , the snow around ProtagonistB a damp , churned scarlet . < nl > The night - creatures circled ProtagonistB like lions . One nipped at the toe of ProtagonistB's boot . < nl > ProtagonistA flicked the light toward it , and the creature scrambled backward . < nl > Panning the light in front of ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA stepped into ProtagonistB's footsteps , toward the pack of nightmares that watched snarling and spitting from the shadows . As ProtagonistA grew closer ProtagonistA could smell only rot and clay and fur . They growled and bared their teeth , but the creatures did not dare venture into ProtagonistA's light . They did not stop ProtagonistA from touching ProtagonistB's hand . < nl > It was wet , and cold . ProtagonistA could not look at ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA had to keep turning the light , had to watch the monsters that tried to pad noiselessly behind ProtagonistA . < nl >  ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA whispered ,  ProtagonistB have to get up .  < nl > For a long terrible moment , ProtagonistB did not move . ProtagonistC let out a strange low rumble , as if laughing at ProtagonistA trying to drag ProtagonistB's corpse up out of the snow . < nl > But then ProtagonistC drew ProtagonistC up on ProtagonistC's elbows , ProtagonistC's breath a ragged wet tearing sound . < nl > One of the beasts lunged for ProtagonistC's throat . ProtagonistA chased it away with the light and screamed at it with everything ProtagonistA had . < nl > ProtagonistB rose . The night creatures drooled and snapped at ProtagonistB's heels , but they did not touch ProtagonistB . < nl > Together , father and daughter limped back into the house . < nl > And all the while , ProtagonistA never let ProtagonistA's light waver . < nl > * * * < nl > /r / shoringupfragments < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA had always been the victim of very nearly bad luck . There were many stories in ProtagonistA's life of ProtagonistA's brushes at catastrophe . ProtagonistA could picture all of them clearly in ProtagonistA's mind . Even the ones that ProtagonistA could n't really remember had been told to ProtagonistA so many times that ProtagonistA held them in ProtagonistA's head like ProtagonistA's own memories . < nl > ProtagonistA's first case of very nearly bad luck had come as a toddler . A curious child , ProtagonistA had found an unprotected outlet , and attempted to jam a hair clip into it . Moments before the clip had reached the socket , ProtagonistB had struck a pole with ProtagonistB's car up the street , cutting power to ProtagonistA's house . Alarmed by the sudden loss of power , ProtagonistA's father had looked up to see ProtagonistA , unphased , jamming the little bit of metal into the outlet . ProtagonistA's father had called that their little miracle , and the family began to frequent church a little more often on Sundays . ProtagonistA's father had even looked up ProtagonistB , and phoned ProtagonistB to tell ProtagonistB the story . < nl > ProtagonistA's next brush had come when ProtagonistA was older . Playing basketball with ProtagonistA's neighborhood friends , ProtagonistA had chased a ball into the street . A horn blared , and ProtagonistA looked up to see a car bearing down on ProtagonistA at great speed . Then the car performed a cartoonish maneuver , moving almost perfectly sideways to avoid ProtagonistA , before coming to a stop . The driver had gotten out and berated ProtagonistA , but ProtagonistA had n't heard a word . ProtagonistA had stood replaying the impossible scene in ProtagonistA's head , over and over . < nl > Sitting on the school bus , ProtagonistA found ProtagonistA wrapped up in these memories again . ProtagonistA often returned to them , turning them over in ProtagonistA's head again and again . ProtagonistA's parents liked to joke about ProtagonistA's very nearly bad luck , but ProtagonistA knew ProtagonistA's many near misses had made them worriers . At first ProtagonistA too had been anxious , fearful of what lay around the corner . But ProtagonistA had come to feel strangely calm . ProtagonistA would never let ProtagonistA think the world , never let it fully form in ProtagonistA's mind , but ProtagonistA felt invincible . < nl > The bus came to a stop and ProtagonistA hopped down the steps , and began the long trudge up ProtagonistA's dirt driveway . It had been another long day at school , but ProtagonistA was looking forward to playing chess with ProtagonistA's Papa , who had been staying with them the last few months . ProtagonistA was considering first moves when ProtagonistA heard a loud crack above ProtagonistA . Looking up ProtagonistA saw a large tree branch coming down toward ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA did n't have time to think , much less dive out of the way , when the most improbable thing ProtagonistA had ever seen occurred . A great eagle , impossibly large , ProtagonistA thought , swooped through , grabbing the limb in its talons and flying off with it . ProtagonistA watched it , frozen . ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA had just seen was impossible . It was like the car , moving around ProtagonistA like a glitch in a video game . That 's too much , ProtagonistA thought , exasperated . < nl > Later that night , ProtagonistA laid in bed , wide awake , mind racing . ProtagonistA had n't told anyone about ProtagonistA's eagle savior . Shell shocked , ProtagonistA had walked through the day on autopilot . For the first time , ProtagonistA was beginning to consider the possibility that ProtagonistA might be losing ProtagonistA's mind . But when ProtagonistA had gone back outside to look at the tree , ProtagonistA had seen a broken branch far above ProtagonistA . It had happened . < nl > Staring at the ceiling , ProtagonistA let the word creep to the front of ProtagonistA's brain for the very first time . Invincible . ProtagonistA cringed . Was God protecting ProtagonistA ? For what purpose ? Why ProtagonistA ? ProtagonistA rolled over and smushed ProtagonistA's pillow to ProtagonistA's face in frustration .  ProtagonistA guess your story is n't over yet ,  ProtagonistA thought . And then ProtagonistA sat bolt upright . An image , fleeting but startlingly clear , had flashed through ProtagonistA's mind . A woman with glasses and a tired face was bent over a notebook , scribbling furiously . Something seared through ProtagonistA's consciousness for a moment , some essential truth , and then it was gone . The image was gone , too , only the heart racing sensation remaining . < nl > ProtagonistA got up and looked out the window . Invincible .  Invincible ,  ProtagonistA muttered .  We 'll see about that .  ProtagonistA opened ProtagonistA's window , and climbed out on to the roof . < eos > 
< sos >  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB understand ProtagonistA 're upset but ...  Began ProtagonistB , shifting uncomfortably back and forth . < nl >  No , NO , ProtagonistA will not hear it , it is stated in the prophesy and that is the end of it .  Replied ProtagonistA , pacing to and fro , marking the imaginary chalkboard that engulfed ProtagonistA's mind .  ProtagonistA will make the arrangements and the wedding will be at the spring equinox , as has been foretold in the-  < nl >  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB love ProtagonistC !  Said ProtagonistB , slamming ProtagonistB's boot heel to the cobblestone floor . < nl > ProtagonistA paused ProtagonistA's frantic pacing to regard ProtagonistB's outburst . ProtagonistA then continued on unperturbed mumbling plans to ProtagonistA and occasionally barking orders at ProtagonistA's attendants . < nl >  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB know this is hard to understand . ProtagonistB admit there were times along our adventure where ProtagonistB's emotions got the better of ProtagonistB and some of ProtagonistB's actions may have been , eh , misconstrued . The simple truth is that ProtagonistB do n't see ProtagonistA like that .  Offered ProtagonistB sympathetically . < nl > ProtagonistA halted in ProtagonistA's tracks and locked eyes with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA slithered towards ProtagonistB and constricted ProtagonistA's face .  Listen ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA hissed ,  ProtagonistA do n't give two goblin teeth who ProtagonistB do or do not love . For the past month ProtagonistA have been held prisoner in a dark kings dungeon . Speaking generally , that causes the population to lose faith in their ruler being able to protect them . Which leads to rebellions . Are ProtagonistB seeing ProtagonistA's issue here , * hero * ? ProtagonistA need to look strong and stable . And what better way to do that than to marry up with ProtagonistB ?  ProtagonistA finished cheerily . < nl > ProtagonistB strained ProtagonistB's neck backwards , away from ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB coughed slightly and began to back towards the door . Two guards quickly locked halberds across the oaken door sealing ProtagonistB with ProtagonistA . < nl >  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB advise ProtagonistA reconsider . The people love ProtagonistA , the inhabitants are happy .  ProtagonistB tried vainly to placate ProtagonistA . < nl >  Yes , yes the rubes in the fields will follow whatever half - baked theology ProtagonistA get men in white robes to spew at them . Speaking of , they will be the ones to arrange out matrimony ceremony . Some babble about light and forces .  < nl >  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB beg ProtagonistA ! ProtagonistB did not emancipate ProtagonistA to be promptly thrust into the very nightmare ProtagonistB have just liberated ProtagonistA from !  Sputtered ProtagonistB , watching the guards slowly encroach upon ProtagonistB . < nl >  Do ProtagonistB truly believe that was the last enemy that will attempt to intrude upon ProtagonistA's kingdom ? Nay , ProtagonistA's enemies are numerous and eclectic . They see weakness miles away . They wait , perched upon ProtagonistA's parapets , concealed within ProtagonistA's courts . ProtagonistB shall be ProtagonistA's protection from that , or rather the idea of ProtagonistB will . Mighty hero willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to save his queen , all foretold in prophecy . No one would be foolish enough to stop ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA finished proudly , staring at ProtagonistB through a row of armed guards . < nl >  ProtagonistA 've gone mad !  Said ProtagonistB , crashing against the guards barring ProtagonistB's way . Their numbers proved too many and ProtagonistB could not prevent ProtagonistB's own capture . Subdued , ProtagonistB was brought in shackles to face ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistA clucked ProtagonistA's tongue and wagged ProtagonistA's finger .  Throw ProtagonistB in the keep for a week . That will show the brute manners .  < nl > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ < nl > ProtagonistD ProtagonistC , where are ProtagonistC going ProtagonistC ?  < nl >  ProtagonistC do n't know ProtagonistD . ProtagonistC had a bad dream and ProtagonistC think ProtagonistB needs ProtagonistC .  < nl >  Very well ProtagonistC , but take this .  ProtagonistD said handing ProtagonistC a small sword wrapped in rose silk .  It will let ProtagonistC decide ProtagonistC's fate .  < nl > ProtagonistC's jaw was clenched and the fires of passion burned through ProtagonistC's eyes . ProtagonistC nodded once and went into the tempestuous night . < eos >

ProtagonistA beamed at the demons as they raised their wings skyward .  Great job ! Now put your right leg forward ! Forelegs only , Taurics ! Rightmost tendril , Cephalians !  It took a moment for the masses of infernal beings to do so , but they did . < nl > From the boombox the upbeat music continued to play . < nl >  Great ! Now left ! Now right ! Now left ! Now right ! Now point your fingers up and give ProtagonistA some hellfire !  ProtagonistA could feel the heat from dozens of jets of infernal flames shooting upwards . The ceiling of ProtagonistA's studio glowed , but they 'd installed runes to block the magic from shooting through the roof again . < nl > Two weeks , it had been two weeks . Beneath ProtagonistA's cheerful grin , ProtagonistA wanted to scream . < nl > It had started with a phone call , of all things . < nl > --- < nl > The call had come in on ProtagonistA's work line . ProtagonistA had just set up shop , taking the severance package from ProtagonistA's last job to finally open up as a personal trainer . Ads had gone out , and ProtagonistA 'd been waiting for clients with bated breath . < nl >  ProtagonistA , how can ProtagonistB help ProtagonistA ?  < nl > The voice that had come through the other line was harsh and grating .  ProtagonistA's advertisement says ProtagonistA do group classes ?  < nl > ProtagonistA tried ProtagonistA's best to accept all people and not judge anyone needlessly . ProtagonistB had some kind of vocal impairment . The fact that it made ProtagonistA's hair stand on end and a chill run up ProtagonistA's spin was not ProtagonistB's fault .  Of course ! Up to three dozen people !  < nl >  ProtagonistB see .  The voice now that it was expected , did not get any easier to endure .  And ProtagonistA mentioned discretion ?  < nl >  Of course .  ProtagonistA had n't meant discretion , the ad had was supposed to say  Excellent Direction ,  but the first run had an error when ProtagonistA printed it . < nl >  Wonderful . ProtagonistB have a contract ProtagonistA could sign .  < nl >  Oh , well , ProtagonistA have ProtagonistA's own contracts , but ...  < nl >  ProtagonistA , we will sign ProtagonistA as well . But ProtagonistB must insist on ours . ProtagonistB's associates are very particular about that .  < nl > * Oh god ProtagonistB 's from the mob or something . *  Oh , well , that won't ... Ill need to read over it . ProtagonistA's standard rates are -  < nl >  ProtagonistA .  The way the voice said ProtagonistA's name was ... disturbing . Like something ProtagonistA 'd heard in a nightmare .  We wo n't expect ProtagonistA to only charge standard rates . We can reward ProtagonistA quite handsomely on top of that .  < nl >  Great !  * Okay , ProtagonistA , get ProtagonistB in , check the contract , find a problem and tell ProtagonistB to go somewhere else . Easy peasy . *  When can ProtagonistB come by ?  < nl > The door opened .  Now ,  said the voice , both in ProtagonistA's ear in and in the building . ProtagonistB was ... not what ProtagonistA had expected . Young and kind of good looking , with a black goatee and a red suit .  ProtagonistB's name is Chemosh . And ProtagonistB want ProtagonistA to , as ProtagonistA's poster promises ... whip ProtagonistB's associates into shape .  < nl >  Oh ,  ProtagonistB's voice sounded better in person . Must have been interference .  Of course . That 's what we do here .  < nl >  Even for non - humans ?  < nl > It had taken ProtagonistA a few minutes to peg ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB was one of those LARPers , like ProtagonistA's little brother . They pretended to be elves or vampires or , in ProtagonistB's case , demons . ProtagonistB's friends and ProtagonistB were losing some kind of LARP war , and wanted to exercise more to get in shape . Simple enough . ProtagonistB's contract , at least , was just Roleplay stuff - in exchange for ProtagonistA's service , ProtagonistA would be elevated to the demonic rank of ProtagonistA's choice and granted a single wish . < nl > ProtagonistA 'd believed that right up until the first class had shown up , slinking in on tendrils and with bowed heads fitted with horns . Figures far too strange to be costumes or makeup . < nl > To ProtagonistA's credit , ProtagonistA had n't screamed . < nl > --- < nl >  And that 's enough for today boys ! See you tomorrow .  < nl > The demons lumbered out , taking on human forms as they did . ProtagonistA snuck out back and lit a cigarette , ProtagonistA's hand shaking . < nl > Two weeks . Two week of training the demons , and they were at least listening to ProtagonistA . But ProtagonistA had no idea if ProtagonistA's exercise regimen , hastily thrown together for a diverse range of beings , was right , but ProtagonistA 'd done ProtagonistA best . Two more weeks in their contract , and then ProtagonistA got ProtagonistA's wish . With the option to renew . It sounded like a terrible idea , but ProtagonistA did n't know what else to do . < nl > Especially since ProtagonistA 'd noticed ProtagonistA's own reflection during the class , and seen ProtagonistA's eyes were beginning to glow red . < nl > * ProtagonistA guess ProtagonistA should figure out what rank ProtagonistA want ... * The idea had crossed ProtagonistA's mind of trying to renege on the contract , but ProtagonistA had read what happened to people who backed out of deals with the Devil . < nl > ProtagonistA took a deep breath and exhaled smoke , an exhalation that lasted far longer than the mere cigarette would allow for . Far hotter , too - the smoke was glowing red near ProtagonistA's mouth . < nl > ProtagonistA put out the cigarette on ProtagonistA's palm . It did n't hurt . < nl > Well , at least ProtagonistA had n't sold ProtagonistA's soul . < nl > Hoping ProtagonistA would n't grow horns before ProtagonistA's date tomorrow , ProtagonistA got into ProtagonistA's car and headed home . < nl > --- < nl > [ Part 2 here](https://www.reddit.com / r / WritingPrompts / comments/7vmkl1 / wp_youve_been_sent_to_exercise_the_demons_not / dttyyfe/ ) < nl > More at /r / Hydrael_Writes < eos >

ProtagonistA 'll throw up if ProtagonistA even have another bite of that steak .  < nl > Mornings were the worst . Even before ProtagonistA moved in here , ProtagonistA had trouble waking up . But now that ProtagonistA shared a bed with ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's comfortable , comfortable cushions , ProtagonistA was a sucker for sleep . Add to that having to eat a meal every morning that would make a King jealous , it was a miracle ProtagonistA got to work on time . < nl > As ProtagonistA descended down the stairs , ProtagonistA saw ProtagonistC in the living room waiting for ProtagonistA . < nl >  Hey , ProtagonistC . How do ProtagonistA look ?  < nl >  As beautiful as ever , ProtagonistA .  < nl >  Thank ProtagonistC .  < nl >  But come here a moment , ProtagonistA's lipstick is a bit askew .  < nl >  Ugh , thanks .

It 's because of ProtagonistB that ProtagonistA are getting ProtagonistA's beauty sleep .  < nl > ProtagonistC was right about that though . 9 hours of sleep every night does wonders to the skin . < nl >  There . Be careful .  < nl >  ProtagonistA will be . Love ProtagonistC , ProtagonistC .  < nl > Hurriedly , ProtagonistA put ProtagonistA's key in the door and turned . Lu was sitting on the steps , turning over the morning paper . < nl >  Hey , Lu .  < nl >  Someone came home late last night .  < nl >  Late shift at the clinic . It was n't anything else .  < nl >  Jesus , ProtagonistA . How dumb do ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA am ?  < nl >  What do ProtagonistA know ?  < nl >  Enough to tell NV .  < nl >  Alright , alright . Shush . It was a guy .  < nl >  Ooooh .  < nl >  Lu !  < nl >  Go on .  < nl >  It was n't anything . Just a date .  < nl >  And ?  < nl >  And we kissed .  < nl >  And ?  < nl >  And we have a second date on Friday .  < nl >  AND ?  < nl >  And ProtagonistA am late for work .

ProtagonistA am so sorry .  < nl >  ProtagonistA , THEY ARE GOING TO FIRE ProtagonistA IF ProtagonistA KEEP THIS UP .  < nl >  Calm down , Rat . ProtagonistA 'll do better .  < nl >  ProtagonistA FUCKING HOPE SO . NOW SHOW ProtagonistA THOSE BOYS WHO CATCALLED ProtagonistA AROUND THE CORNER .  < nl >  ProtagonistA can deal with it . ProtagonistA do n't have to worry .  < nl >  I'LL STOP WORRYING AFTER ProtagonistA PUNCH THEIR FACES IN .  < nl >  Rat , if ProtagonistA hear anything happened to them ...  < nl >  FINE . BUT IF THEY DO IT AGAIN , THAT 'S IT !  < nl > ProtagonistA moved the gear from parking and put it on first when ProtagonistA hear a thud . < nl >  Hey !  < nl >  ProtagonistD ? Where are ProtagonistD ?  < nl >  Under the car .  < nl > ProtagonistD got out from under there and beamed a sly smile at ProtagonistA . < nl >  What are ProtagonistD doing ?  < nl >  ProtagonistD was putting on ProtagonistA's new chrome wheels .  < nl >  Again ?  < nl >  Well , ProtagonistA keep taking them off .  < nl >  That 's because they look stupid .  < nl >  Do n't ProtagonistA call them stupid , ProtagonistA . Take it back .  < nl >  They are stupid . ProtagonistA work in a hospital , ProtagonistD . They do n't fit .  < nl >  Maybe get another car . ProtagonistA want ProtagonistD to look up cars for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA ?  < nl >  ProtagonistD , ProtagonistA am really late . Just get out of the way .  < nl >  Sure . But ProtagonistD will look up cars for ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA . FOR ProtagonistA .  < nl > ProtagonistA had barely composed ProtagonistA when ProtagonistA heard a voice from the backseat . < nl >  I heard ProtagonistA met ProtagonistE . How is ProtagonistE better than me ?  < nl > ---- < eos > 
< sos > When ProtagonistA went missing , we scoured near every inch of that forest . ProtagonistA was all over the news , blue - eyed and smiling , ProtagonistA's dark hair pulled up in a prim ponytail . Sometimes they showed ProtagonistA doing what ProtagonistA loved : forty feet up in the open air , clinging to a rock wall , nothing between ProtagonistA and death but a harness and a few nylon ropes . < nl > I took that picture . I remember how ProtagonistA beamed at me and said through ProtagonistA's teeth ,  Stop * shaking * so hard ,  because my new - discovered crippling vertigo was practically making the GoPro tremble . That was only a few months before ProtagonistA disappeared . < nl > ProtagonistA had nestled ProtagonistA deep in the Crazy Mountains , a chain of knifing peaks clustered at the edge of the Rockies . I had n't worried . ProtagonistA brought ProtagonistC , ProtagonistA's pack , ProtagonistA's rifle . The solar - powered charging pack I got ProtagonistA for ProtagonistA's birthday . ProtagonistA knew how to hunt and how to flee . < nl > ProtagonistA was smart . ProtagonistA would be safe because ProtagonistA was ProtagonistA . < nl > How many days I spent watching summer give way to autumn , and I could do nothing but follow the grid , pace endless stretches of wild . Just screaming into the wilderness . The nights became freezing , and the searches dwindled until it was only me out there , sometimes ProtagonistB , when ProtagonistB could bring ProtagonistB to face another day of it all . < nl > We knew exactly where to look , and we found nothing . < nl > One day ProtagonistC came bolting out of the woods with a broken leash and a harness full of bristles and leaves . ProtagonistC was filthy and delighted to see ProtagonistB , but ProtagonistA was n't with ProtagonistC . < nl > How could a girl just disappear ? That question chased exhausting circles around my mind for months . I could n't even bring myself to move . I just stayed in the shitty little town I grew up in , waiting to wake up to the news one day . See ProtagonistA's hale and healthy and whole when I flick on the television . < nl > But there is nothing and there will be nothing . I let that truth fall and shatter like glass every morning until I could walk through the shards without bleeding . < nl > And now I only think about ProtagonistA every so often , when I hear ProtagonistA's favorite song on the radio or smell lavender , which ProtagonistA carried in ProtagonistA's pocket like a good luck charm . < nl > Or on days like yesterday , that day twelve months ago when ProtagonistA simply never came home . < nl > Today , it is the chain of one hundred nineteen messages that I wake to . For a moment I sit bleary - eyed and blinking at my phone , thinking it was some kind of ugly joke by the universe . My phone glitching in the most heartbreaking way imaginable . < nl > They are all from ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's contact picture smiles at me as if from beyond the grave . < nl > I begin to read and weep all at once . < nl > * August 28 , 7:30 PM * < nl > > Well I am really fucked , Henry < nl > > I really thoroughly fucked myself over < nl > > shit fuck fuck < nl > * 7:31 PM * < nl > > do n't be angry < nl > > but I may have broken my promise not to free solo < nl > > and fallen and fucked my ankle < nl > > it 's like bent the wrong way < nl > * 7:32 PM * < nl > > I fell somewhere ... I have no idea . There 's no signal . You ca n't even hear me . < nl > > Why am I even doing this < nl > * 7:35 PM * < nl > > My coordinates are here .

ProtagonistD wants to chase it . ProtagonistD 's going insane . < nl > Then the next morning , a trail of texts ensuring me ProtagonistA was coming . Then a week of nothing until finally < nl > * September 5 , 8:12 PM * < nl > > ca n't walk < nl > > ProtagonistD 's gone < nl > > ProtagonistD's leash snapped and ProtagonistD took off after something and ProtagonistD 's gone < nl > > where the fuck are ProtagonistA < nl > * September 7 , 6:30 PM * < nl > > ha . better crutch - stick found . campfire made . < nl > > I 'll kill this forest before it kills me . < nl > * September 14 , 7:33 AM * < nl > > ProtagonistA's solar charger thing really hates cloudy days , by the way < nl > > so bad choice there < nl > As the time went on , ProtagonistA gave up on ProtagonistA like the rest of us did too . ProtagonistA stopped talking about what we would do when we saw each other again . Started sending me stuff like < nl > > tell ProtagonistB ProtagonistA love ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistA 'm sorry ProtagonistA 'm so stupid all the time < nl > and < nl > > have ProtagonistA already stopped looking for ProtagonistA ? < nl > > ProtagonistA should < nl > > it 's not worth it < nl > > none of this is worth it < nl > Then nothing , for weeks . The next text is timestamped from February 6 . < nl > > brr < nl > * February 15 , 5:20 AM * < nl > > ProtagonistA met ProtagonistE today . ProtagonistE stopped and said hello ProtagonistA think .

I feel like an asshole skimming over ProtagonistA's trauma , but I ca n't help myself . < nl > The last text was only five minutes ago . < nl > It says , < nl > > ProtagonistA guess ProtagonistA 'm having fish for breakfast . < nl > For the first time in a year , I know exactly where ProtagonistA is . Exactly what ProtagonistA 's doing . < nl > ProtagonistA 's sitting beside some placid mountain lake somewhere , texting idly , not even looking at the signal bar ProtagonistA 's used to seeing empty . < nl > I know I should call the national park service instantly . ProtagonistB , at least . < nl > But I 'm selfish . < nl > I call ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistA answers ,  Oh , hey , you .  ProtagonistA's voice twists .  About time .  < nl > * * * < nl > /r / shoringupfragments < eos > 
< sos >  It 's just a really bad storm ,  replied The Do - Gooder , adjusting his over - sized utility belt . < nl >  A bad storm ? With no clouds in the sky ? Do n't be stupid . ProtagonistA told you , ProtagonistA can sense a strong power entering the city . This being has the ability to manipulate the elements and it is coming here to free ProtagonistA .  < nl > ProtagonistB was looking at both of us , ProtagonistB's tail changing to that of a mouse .  ProtagonistB do n't know , DG , ProtagonistB think ProtagonistA is telling the truth . Maybe we should just let ProtagonistA go ...  < nl > DG scoffed and landed a heavy hand on ProtagonistB's shoulder .  That 's what ProtagonistC wants ProtagonistB to do . We release ProtagonistA from those chains and then--  the building shook , dimming the lights before the generators kicked on ,  then ProtagonistA escapes to destroy the city once more . No , ProtagonistB , ProtagonistA will stay here in this cell forever . We can investigate this ourselves . If we were able to trap ProtagonistC , then this being stands no chance against us !  < nl > ProtagonistA was at a loss . Maintain ProtagonistA's solitude and allow the city to be destroyed . Or reveal ProtagonistA , losing everything ProtagonistA 'd work so hard to obtain , just so that ProtagonistA could be a hero once more . DG and AB argued amongst themselves as ProtagonistA allowed ProtagonistA's mind to travel over the city . It moved in dark shadows , but ProtagonistA could make out the shape of a dark red beating heart moving ever closer . It called to ProtagonistA as it floated over the mountains to the west and ProtagonistA could feel the darkness of it covering the skies . < nl > DG tightened the shackles that bound ProtagonistA's wrists and ankles .  No , ProtagonistA stays . Come , let us confront this being once and for all !  < nl > ProtagonistA glanced about ProtagonistA's little cell for the last time . It had been worth it to allow ProtagonistA to be captured . Seeing everything as ProtagonistA did , being able to manipulate time and energy : it had been as gratifying as it had been exhausting . The fame , the attention , the booming sound of all of their thoughts constantly ringing in ProtagonistA's ears . It had been too much . Asking to be left alone had drawn the cameras and flashing lights closer . The reporters had followed ProtagonistA everywhere . Until ProtagonistA became a villain . ProtagonistA set fire to a few cars and exploded a bank vault . Minor incidents with no true victims . ProtagonistA did n't even take any money . It would have been just arson , really , and yet they began to distance themselves . They feared ProtagonistA and left ProtagonistA alone . But then it became an issue of  ProtagonistC sightings  and moronic superheroes trying to bring ProtagonistA down . DG and AB were the ones who happened to show up when ProtagonistA had had enough . ProtagonistA allowed ProtagonistA to be captured and they promised to hide ProtagonistA away in the deepest , darkest vault . Alone . Pure bliss . < nl > But now this . The darkness was enveloping the edges of the western suburbs , the skies black as if it were night . ProtagonistB was attempting to call the guards to open the cell , but the phone on the wall was n't working . DG banged on the cell door , calling out for the guards . < nl > The shackles melted away , falling into a pile of dust on the floor . ProtagonistB was the first one to notice ProtagonistA dusting away ProtagonistA's clothes and ProtagonistB transformed into a mouse , skittering to the other side of the cell . < nl >  This cell is 100 floors below ground . They are n't going to hear ProtagonistA .  The Do - Gooder jumped back , his hand going for his utility belt . A flick of the wrist and it too melted away . His hands went to his waist to keep his pants up . It would have been comical under other circumstances . < nl > The bars opened and we began soaring up the shaft . The elevator was stuck at the top but it moved out of the way as we neared it . ProtagonistB changed into a squirrel and hid ProtagonistB under the cape of DG . < nl >  What on Earth ? How is this-- we defeated ProtagonistA !  < nl > DG was apoplectic , his face red and eyes wide . Poor guy .  Hmm ? Oh , yes , that ,  ProtagonistA opened the doors of the main floor and we flew through the lobby to the front door .  Well , ProtagonistA did , but I allowed ProtagonistA to . I needed the break .  < nl > His stammering faded away as we considered the darkness overcoming the city .  Listen , ProtagonistA really must run . Thank you for--  ProtagonistA struggled to find the words .  Just ... thanks .  < nl > Another booming sound and ProtagonistA was standing in the heart of the storm , alone . We stood in what remained of the city hall plaza but it was being reduced to rubble . ProtagonistA could feel the being within reach and its laugh filled the air before it settled before ProtagonistA . < nl >  ProtagonistC ! ProtagonistC 've ruined my plans !  < nl > ProtagonistA stared at the being as it transformed from a dark cloud into the face that ProtagonistA knew so well . It was like looking into a mirror .  Hello sister .  < nl > ------------- < nl > Edit : Thanks for the comments ! Just posted Part 2 below ... < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA 've always hated attention . ProtagonistA leave the comfort of ProtagonistA's apartment only when necessary . That includes work , the grocery store , for short walks , and on rare occasions , the gym . So when ProtagonistA stepped outside to take a walk on the trail near ProtagonistA's building , ProtagonistA all but froze . Usually there are quite a few people mucking about . ProtagonistA live in a nice area and in the summer people like to enjoy the market that pops up on the weekend . It just happened that ProtagonistA had to pass that market to get to the trail . < nl > ProtagonistA stepped onto the sidewalk and immediately everyone 's eyes were glued to ProtagonistA's face . Well , not at ProtagonistA's face , per se , but at the general area above ProtagonistA's head . ProtagonistA's heart immediately started to beat fast , and not just because of the attention . Usually someone only garners this much attention when their health bar is extremely low . ProtagonistA had seen it happen ProtagonistA a few times . Once was enough to scar ProtagonistA for life . ProtagonistB It flashed red and ProtagonistB clutched ProtagonistB's heart . A minute later ProtagonistB was dead from cardiac arrest . < nl > It 's something no one can help . Once your health bar drains too low , not even the miracle of modern medicine can save you . The bots had tried though . They swarmed ProtagonistB quickly , administering shocks to try and restart ProtagonistB's heart . But ProtagonistB was gone , somewhere the living can only imagine exists . < nl > So when everyone 's eyes shot to ProtagonistA's health bar , ProtagonistA thought ProtagonistA was done for . ProtagonistA looked left and right , expecting either a car to swerve onto the sidewalk and flatten ProtagonistA , or a gunman to run out of the bank next to ProtagonistA's apartment and kill ProtagonistA . But when nothing happened right away , and no ones eyes had left the area above ProtagonistA's head , ProtagonistA took a breath and chanced a glance upwards . < nl > Well that was unexpected . ProtagonistA's health bar was full , ProtagonistA was in completely good health . Not to be unexpected . That was n't what they were staring at , however . Right below ProtagonistA's health bar , a strange blue bar had appeared . It was slowly growing in strength . ProtagonistA watched as it filled and a strange glow surrounded it . Now ProtagonistA 'd played enough video games to have an inkling of what was going on . But ProtagonistA was n't in a video game . Mana was n't a real thing . What the hell was going on ? < nl > ProtagonistC pointed at ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistD , what 's that ?  ProtagonistD just shook ProtagonistD's head and tugged ProtagonistC away from ProtagonistA . ProtagonistC was n't the only one either . More and more people were moving out of ProtagonistA's way . They seemed to be scared of this new bar that had appeared . ProtagonistA's heart failed to slow and ProtagonistA wondered if this was some sort of warning that , even though ProtagonistA was in perfect health , something terrible was happening to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA had never seen this bar before . What could it mean ? < nl > ProtagonistA turned to head to the trail only to see more people shying away as ProtagonistA walked . No one wanted to be within twenty feet of ProtagonistA . They all stared and moved out of ProtagonistA's way , as if whatever ProtagonistA had was contagious . ProtagonistA walked slow , reaching the trail far later than ProtagonistA should have . The sun was just beginning to dip in the sky and ProtagonistA what ProtagonistA had planned on being a relaxing Sunday afternoon had become something of a nightmare . ProtagonistA did n't like random strangers coming up and talking to ProtagonistA , but the thought that people ProtagonistA 'd never even talked to being afraid to even walk near ProtagonistA was making ProtagonistA both sad and angry . What did ProtagonistA ever do to any of them ? < nl > The trail was empty , thankfully . ProtagonistA did n't want to deal with anymore stares . ProtagonistA walked in silence , and although ProtagonistA did n't forget this strange , blue bar , ProtagonistA was able to relax within nature . ProtagonistA stopped in ProtagonistA's usual spot , a bench overlooking the lake . The sun cast brilliant colors into the sky . A watercolor painting of reds , oranges , and pinks . ProtagonistA sat , fully ready to enjoy the sunset before returning and making supper . < nl > ProtagonistA did n't hear the footsteps on the gravel as they approached . Only felt the hand as it was placed firmly on ProtagonistA's shoulder , making ProtagonistA squeak embarrassingly and jump off of the bench . Six people stood before ProtagonistA . ProtagonistE held ProtagonistE's hand up in apology . < nl >  ProtagonistE did n't mean to scar ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistE said .  ProtagonistE thought ProtagonistA would have heard us .  < nl >  Who are ProtagonistE ?  < nl >  ProtagonistE 'm Gerald ,  ProtagonistE answered .  This is Marie , Thomas , ProtagonistL , ProtagonistH , and Luka . We 're here for ProtagonistA .  < nl > ProtagonistA's heart rate immediately spiked again . Where they here because of the blue bar ? Where they going to kidnap ProtagonistA ? Where they going to kill ProtagonistA ? They did n't look like government agents . They were in street clothes and none of them seemed to be carrying weapons . < nl > ProtagonistF erupted in laughter .  No , honey . We 're not the government .  ProtagonistF turned to ProtagonistG .  ProtagonistA thinks we 're here to kill ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistG started laughing as well . < nl > ProtagonistE looked sharply at them .  Enough .  < nl > They quieted but their smiles did n't waver . How in the world did ProtagonistF know what ProtagonistA was thinking . There was no such thing as mind reading . ProtagonistA must be imagining things . The afternoon had been stressful and now ProtagonistA was just making things up . < nl >  Nope ,  ProtagonistF said . < nl >  ProtagonistE apologize for ProtagonistH ,  ProtagonistE said .  ProtagonistH 's the newest . ProtagonistH has n't yet learned protocol .  < nl >  ProtagonistH 've been here for three years !  ProtagonistH wined . < nl >  And yet ProtagonistH still do n't know how to behave !  ProtagonistI waved ProtagonistI's hand and ProtagonistH was enveloped in a strange cylinder . ProtagonistA watched as ProtagonistH's mouth continued to move but no sound reached ProtagonistA's ears . ProtagonistH pounded on ProtagonistH's encasement but it only waved like it was made of water , or gel , and then stilled again . ProtagonistH folded ProtagonistH's arms and stared daggers at ProtagonistJ . < nl >  Thank ProtagonistA ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistE said .  Now , ProtagonistE understand that ProtagonistA do n't have a clue about what is happening . Trust ProtagonistE , we 've all been there . But ProtagonistA need to come with us now . Everything will be explained , ProtagonistE promise , but we do n't have time . It chose ProtagonistA .  < nl >  What chose ProtagonistA ?  < nl >  Not here ,  ProtagonistE said , hushed .  ProtagonistA never know what may be listening .  < nl > What , not who . These people were either crazy or on some serious trip . ProtagonistA glanced over ProtagonistA's shoulder for a way to leave , but ProtagonistA did n't fancy a steep descend down a grassy slope , most likely ending in a sprained ankle of some sort . < nl > ProtagonistH pounded on ProtagonistH's fluid - prison , pointing at ProtagonistA . < nl >  Not now ,  ProtagonistE said to ProtagonistH before beckoning ProtagonistA to follow them .  We do n't have much time before they arrive .  < nl > ProtagonistH continued to gesture at ProtagonistA , shouting something . ProtagonistA growled but waved ProtagonistA's hand again , dissolving whatever it was that had held ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA took ProtagonistA's chance while they were distracted . ProtagonistA moved right as ProtagonistA shouted that ProtagonistA was going to run . < nl > Suddenly ProtagonistA was frozen . Both ProtagonistA's feet hovered off the ground as ProtagonistA was stuck mid - stride . ProtagonistA could n't turn ProtagonistA's head to see them . ProtagonistA could n't so much as twitch ProtagonistA's pinkie toe . ProtagonistA fell as ProtagonistE grabbed ProtagonistA . < nl >  ProtagonistE am sorry ,  ProtagonistE said , ProtagonistE's deep voice reverberating through ProtagonistA's body .  ProtagonistA 'll thank us later .  Then ProtagonistA was nowhere . ProtagonistA could n't see anything but pure blackness . But ProtagonistA could hear everything . Quick footsteps down the gravel trail , incoherent shouts made by unseen people , a car door slamming , it 's engine starting . ProtagonistA felt the vibrations as we moved quickly down the street and then ProtagonistA felt nothing . Saw nothing . Heard nothing . < nl > Was nothing . < nl > ProtagonistA do n't know how long ProtagonistA was out or how far ProtagonistA had traveled . When ProtagonistA finally pried ProtagonistA's eyes open do a soft , dim light over ProtagonistA's head , ProtagonistA found that ProtagonistA was lying on the worlds most comfortable mattress . An IV was attached to ProtagonistA's left inner arm and a multitude of machines surrounded ProtagonistA , beeping every so often . < nl >  Ah ,  ProtagonistK said off to ProtagonistA's left . ProtagonistK sat in the chair there . ProtagonistK was with the group that took ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA knew it had n't been a dream right then . Whoever those people were , they had actually kidnapped ProtagonistA and stuck ProtagonistA with a needle .  Welcome back . ProtagonistE did n't know how long ProtagonistA 'd be out . ProtagonistL goes a little crazy sometimes when we 're under attack .  < nl >  Under attack ?  ProtagonistA mumbled . < nl > ProtagonistK stood , retrieving a wheelchair ProtagonistA had n't seen before from the corner . ProtagonistK helped ProtagonistA out of the bed and into it .  Do n't worry , ProtagonistA 're safe here . ProtagonistK 'm taking ProtagonistA to the rest of the team now .  < nl >  Team ?  < nl >  Not much of a talker , are ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistK chuckled .  ProtagonistA 'll get along great with ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistK continued the chatter as ProtagonistK wheeled ProtagonistA down a long hallway lined with pictures of people , all from different time periods it seemed . There was one woman in Victorian garb next to another in Viking attire . There seemed to be no pattern to their placement . < nl >  Here we are .  ProtagonistK pushed ProtagonistA through a doorway into the most elaborate dining room ProtagonistA 'd ever been in . Thick , heavy curtains colored blood - red were cinched on either side of floor length windows . The table stretched form one end to the other yet most of the chairs were empty . At the very far end the rest of ProtagonistA's kidnappers sat , eating what smelled like roasted chicken . ProtagonistA's mouth watered and ProtagonistA's stomach rumbled . < nl > ProtagonistK stopped ProtagonistA in front of Gerald who sat at the head of the table .  ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistK started , ProtagonistK's voice so deep that ProtagonistA could feel it in ProtagonistA's chest .

It was a side effect of the Lift , and it always annoyed ProtagonistA . Not that shaking ProtagonistA's head actually did anything . ProtagonistA checked ProtagonistA's watch . 3:17am . Scanning the side of the elevator , ProtagonistA selected the forty - third floor . < nl > * Okay , ProtagonistA 'm on ground level . Perfect . Door will be opening right at 3:19am . * ProtagonistA's glance jumped from ProtagonistA's watch to the LED showing what floor ProtagonistA was on . < nl > * Ding * < nl > The elevator door opened at 3:18:46 . ProtagonistA 'd been close . But ProtagonistA was still within ProtagonistA's window . As ProtagonistA ran out of the elevator , ProtagonistA trailed an industrial lubricant behind ProtagonistA , the kind of stuff that high tech machines needed to keep themselves running smoothly . < nl > This floor was an office , but a higher ranked one . Instead of cubicles , it had actually offices , with proper doors and locks . < nl > Two weeks had been spent casing this joint . ProtagonistA 'd known about the locks . A small piece of what looked like sticky tack but was actually an explosive compound got shoved onto the lock . ProtagonistA lit the fuse and stepped to the side . < nl > Two things happened in that instant . The tack detonated , causing the door to swing open , and alarms went off . < nl > The security guards downstairs would have finished their round and gotten back to the desk ten minutes ago . Which meant they had to run up forty - three flights of stairs or take the elevators to get up here . ProtagonistA knew , from experience , that they would do both . * Come on , come on ... * < nl > ProtagonistA's prize was in a filing cabinet . This one was also locked , and ProtagonistA had to pick this one properly . Could n't risk damaging it with an explosive . 2 minutes , 46 seconds for elevator to go from this floor to ground floor and back .   Gave ProtagonistA five minutes , thirty - two seconds to crack the lock . < nl > ProtagonistA had it done in almost exactly five minutes . It took ProtagonistA a little bit longer to sift through the files until ProtagonistA found the one ProtagonistA was looking for . Project Oddball . By the time ProtagonistA had it out of the file and into ProtagonistA's messenger bag- < nl > * ding * < nl > The door opened again , and two security guards stepped out , guns raised . They might have actually had a shot at ProtagonistA , but the lubricant from early had n't been expected . Two of them went sprawling as ProtagonistA ran towards them . ProtagonistB had stayed in the elevator , and ProtagonistB opened fire , but ProtagonistA had already dove to the floor , sliding under ProtagonistB's bullets on the gel . When ProtagonistA got through , ProtagonistA kick ProtagonistB in the back of the knee and pushed ProtagonistB out , then frantically began slamming the door closed button . < nl > One of the guards got his bearings enough to take a shot at ProtagonistA as the door closed . The bullet winged ProtagonistA's hip , getting a gasp of pain , but it only grazed ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA got ProtagonistA's hand over the injury before any blood could spill out . < nl > Another bullet punched through the door , but as it did- < nl > * Whumph . * < nl > ProtagonistA was gone , instead sitting in the ground floor elevator of ProtagonistA's apartment building . ProtagonistA pressed twelve to ride up the rest of the way , where bandages were waiting . And now ProtagonistA had the name of a few others , people like ProtagonistA . < nl > It was time to meet the other Oddballs . < nl > --- < nl > [ Part 2](https://www.reddit.com / r / WritingPrompts / comments/7x8s80 / wp_you_can_teleport_but_only_between_empty / du6gi5v/ ) < nl > More at /r / Hydrael_Writes < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA sat across from ProtagonistB at a table draped with a red satin tablecloth .   ProtagonistA's champagne flute remained untouched as ProtagonistA searched for the words to say . < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ProtagonistB , but ,  ProtagonistA paused averting ProtagonistA's gaze .    It 's not ProtagonistB it 's ProtagonistA .  < nl >  What do ProtagonistA mean ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA do n't think ProtagonistA 'm ready for a long term relationship .   It 's just too much right now .   ProtagonistB 're great , truly .   But ProtagonistA think it 's best if we take a break .  < nl >  For how long ?  ProtagonistB asked , sadness crept into ProtagonistB's voice . < nl > ProtagonistA sighed quietly .    ProtagonistA 'll let ProtagonistB know . ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said rising from the table leaving ProtagonistB alone , head hanging . < nl > ProtagonistB watched ProtagonistA go , ProtagonistA's heels clicking against the black and white tiled floor of the Italian restaurant .   * Well , this version did n't work either .   Maybe ProtagonistA really was n't ready for a long term relationship , * ProtagonistB wondered . < nl > * Or . Maybe ProtagonistA does n't realize just how much ProtagonistA needs ProtagonistB . * ProtagonistB dropped a stack of money on the table and slipped into the night .   Heavy rain drops began to fall as ProtagonistB made ProtagonistB's way toward ProtagonistA's apartment . < nl > ProtagonistA tossed ProtagonistA down onto ProtagonistA's couch and pulled ProtagonistA's plush robe around ProtagonistA .   ProtagonistA clutched the warm cup of tea between ProtagonistA's hands and drank deeply . < nl > * This is what ProtagonistA want , * ProtagonistA smiled . < nl > A quiet scratching turned ProtagonistA's head .   * Probably the storm . * ProtagonistA turned the TV to listen to the home decorator explain their choices for the house they had just flipped . < nl > The scratching came again , more urgently this time .   ProtagonistA set ProtagonistA's tea down , ProtagonistA's bare feet whispered across the floor as ProtagonistA made ProtagonistA's way to the front door .   ProtagonistA had to stand on ProtagonistA's toes to see through the small peephole . < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm just hearing things ,  ProtagonistA tried to convince ProtagonistA . < nl > Another series of frantic scratching turned ProtagonistA's head toward the window .   ProtagonistA grabbed an umbrella and gripped it like a baseball bat .   Lightning flashed outside ProtagonistA's apartment , the brilliant light briefly illuminating a small shape on ProtagonistA's fire escape . < nl > * Is that ? * < nl > A quiet meow came from the window as a reply to ProtagonistA's question . < nl >  ProtagonistC !  ProtagonistA cooed as ProtagonistA opened the window and lifted ProtagonistC inside .   ProtagonistC meowed happily and pressed ProtagonistC's head against ProtagonistA's plush robe . < nl > ProtagonistA dried ProtagonistC off and got a small dish of tuna fish for ProtagonistC .

< sos > ProtagonistA could pinpoint exactly when ProtagonistA first thought ProtagonistA's feelings were wrong : eighth grade after Advanced Algebra . ProtagonistB got an 82 % on a test-- and that was disastrously low for ProtagonistB's norm , and considered even lower by ProtagonistB's parents standards .   ProtagonistA spent the rest of the class period trying to cheer ProtagonistB up : < nl >  It 's one test-- it does n't define ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB 're amazing and good at everything . ProtagonistB 're kind and pretty , and this is just a small hiccup ! ProtagonistA know ProtagonistB 'll ace the next test ! ProtagonistA know it ! We can study together-- and ProtagonistB 'll probably be saving ProtagonistA from failing , like ProtagonistB normally do .  < nl > When ProtagonistB smiled back at ProtagonistA , with a red nose , and puffy eyes , ProtagonistA knew that ProtagonistA felt something more for ProtagonistB . < nl > ProtagonistA , of course , buried ProtagonistA's feelings . By no means was ProtagonistA homophobic , but every time ProtagonistA began to feel something for a friend or looked too long at a woman that walked by , ProtagonistA felt unsure of ProtagonistA , felt like others would somehow know what ProtagonistA was thinking and judge ProtagonistA . So ProtagonistA buried it down-- at least , until college . < nl > ProtagonistA decided that ProtagonistA would at least try to get into the dating world . ProtagonistA 'd go to parties with ProtagonistA's friends , and when guys would be interested in ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA 'd flirt back and have some fun-- and ProtagonistA did , in fact , enjoy ProtagonistA's time with most of these guys . So ProtagonistA continued to have fun at parties , flirt , have some friends with benefits , but nothing substantial . ProtagonistA liked these guys , of course , but nothing felt like the dramatic and raw feeling of love and emotion that ProtagonistA always heard about from ProtagonistA's friends . ProtagonistA decided it was time to start seriously dating-- time to find Mr Right , and then ProtagonistA would start to understand how all ProtagonistA's friends felt with their boyfriends . They even said it themselves ,  ProtagonistA just have n't found the right guy , ProtagonistA .  < nl > The first few relationships ProtagonistA was in did not last long-- barely even a relationships since they were only a handful of dates and kisses over two or three months before parting ways . < nl > Then ProtagonistA met ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC was gorgeous-- all of ProtagonistA's friends said so-- and ProtagonistC was very into ProtagonistA . < nl >  ProtagonistA , ProtagonistC have n't been completely honest ,  ProtagonistC said one night during a dinner date two months into their relationship . < nl >  Um-- what ?  < nl >  The first time ProtagonistC met ProtagonistA , it was n't at that coffee shop . We were actually at the same college-- we had a lecture together for one semester . ProtagonistC saw ProtagonistA at a couple parties too .  < nl >  Oh ,  ProtagonistA said , relieved to find out ProtagonistA was n't a side - chick or that ProtagonistC's secret was n't relationship - ending-- but ProtagonistA realized that , maybe ProtagonistA did n't really care if their relationship ended anyway .  That's-- okay . ProtagonistA do n't remember seeing ProtagonistC though .  < nl >  ProtagonistC realized that at the shop ,  ProtagonistC said smiling a bit sheepishly ,  but we did n't really talk and ProtagonistC looked a bit different back then .  < nl > ProtagonistA broke up with ProtagonistC three months later . < nl >  How could ProtagonistA break up with ProtagonistC ? ProtagonistC was so hot !  ProtagonistD , told ProtagonistA . < nl >  There was n't any spark-- ProtagonistC was kind of a doormat . ProtagonistC had no personality and went with whatever ProtagonistA said .  < nl >  That sounds like the perfect man to ProtagonistD .  ProtagonistA threw the couch pillow at ProtagonistD .  Okay , okay-- no man slaves . Hey-- wanna watch a movie tonight ?  < nl > And ProtagonistA never felt more comfortable , more at home , than sharing a blanket with ProtagonistD on their couch and watching a crappy movie . < nl > ProtagonistD moved out six months later to live with ProtagonistD's boyfriend . < nl >  Are ProtagonistA bringing ProtagonistE to the engagement party ?  ProtagonistD asked ProtagonistA half a year later .  Most people Jim and ProtagonistD invited are bring their boyfriends or girlfriends .  < nl > ProtagonistA had been dating ProtagonistE for five months now , and things were nice . They liked all of the exact same things , worked in similar fields , had the same hobbies-- everyone said they were perfect for each other . < nl >  Yeah , ProtagonistE said ProtagonistE 'll come . ProtagonistA said to come for dinner at eight ? Is there anything ProtagonistA could bring ? Dessert ? Wine ?  < nl >  You know we always appreciate more wine-- but we 've got plenty already . All ProtagonistA have to do is bring ProtagonistA . And ProtagonistE .  < nl > Just a few weeks after ProtagonistD's wedding eight months later , ProtagonistA broke it off with ProtagonistE . The wedding itself was beautiful , and ProtagonistA could n't bear to make ProtagonistD worry by breaking up with ProtagonistE before it . < nl >  But Jess-- ProtagonistE love you-- we love each other ! We love all the same foods and places . We even listen to the same music and watch the same shows-- we were perfect for each other this time !  < nl >  That 's the thing , ProtagonistE , ProtagonistA do n't want someone who 's the same as ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA do n't want to date ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA want to date someone that 's different and will push ProtagonistA boundaries-- make ProtagonistA try new things-- maybe ProtagonistA 'll find things that ProtagonistA never even knew ProtagonistA liked before--  < nl > ProtagonistA thought of all the men ProtagonistA 's dated in the past : they were all the same . They were all Nice Guys that were nice and sweet but had nothing to them-- each relationship was hollow and lacked any true , real substance . How many men had ProtagonistA gone on dates with ? 15 ? 20 ? And none of them made ProtagonistA feel any different . ProtagonistA longed to feel the feelings ProtagonistA felt for ProtagonistA's friends with anyone who was n't ProtagonistA's friends . Maybe , ProtagonistA thought , maybe ProtagonistA could . ProtagonistA was so tired , ProtagonistA had nothing to lose . < nl >  ProtagonistE , we 're through . ProtagonistA 'm sorry if it 's sudden , but ProtagonistA 'm tired-- of everything-- ProtagonistA have been for a while now , even before ProtagonistA met ProtagonistE .  < nl >  Well ... ProtagonistE hope ProtagonistA meet someone one day ,  ProtagonistE said after a long moment .  Maybe whoever ProtagonistA date next will be the right man for ProtagonistA .  < nl > ProtagonistA remained quiet as ProtagonistE packed up the few things ProtagonistE had in ProtagonistA's apartment . ProtagonistA doubted any man would be right for ProtagonistA . < nl > ---- < nl > It took ProtagonistA two weeks to text ProtagonistD and ask ProtagonistA to meet ProtagonistD for drinks on Friday night . < nl >  Hey , Jess-- is n't this a gay bar that we 're going to ? ProtagonistD heard it 's a lot of fun ,  ProtagonistD said while they were walking . < nl >  Yeah-- ProtagonistA wanted to check it out ,  ProtagonistA said . They walked in silence for a minute before ProtagonistA's nerves got to ProtagonistA .  Ok-- wait , stop walking for a sec . I-- ProtagonistA need to tell ProtagonistD . We 're not going to this bar just for fun-- ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA 'm bi-- or a lesbian . ProtagonistA do n't really know .  < nl >  Oh-- okay ,  ProtagonistD said after a moment .  How long do ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA 've known ?  < nl >  Eighth grade . ProtagonistA told ProtagonistD about ProtagonistB from high school right ?  < nl >  Oh . Yeah that makes sense ,  ProtagonistD thought for a moment .  Ok ProtagonistA ready to start walking again ? It 's cold .  < nl > ProtagonistA could n't be happier , and hanging out at a bar with ProtagonistB , and the flutters in ProtagonistA's stomach when other women came up to them to flirt-- it was one of the best nights ProtagonistA 's had in a long time . < nl > And that same bar is where ProtagonistA met ProtagonistF three weeks later . There was something about her-- something that made ProtagonistA feel like they knew each other for a long time . They liked a lot of the same things , but were different enough that things were still interesting . < nl > There were some things that were a bit quirky though . ProtagonistF was really bad at shaving ProtagonistF legs-- ProtagonistF would always nick them multiple times every time ProtagonistF shaved . ProtagonistF was also really bad with makeup and could n't tell concealer from foundation . ProtagonistF never had any pads or tampons in ProtagonistF's apartment either . ProtagonistA had never asked ProtagonistF about it , but ProtagonistA hoped nothing traumatic happened to ProtagonistF that would cause ProtagonistF's period to stop . ProtagonistF also had a whole ton of men 's clothing in ProtagonistF's apartment . < nl > For all ProtagonistA's quirks though , ProtagonistA felt better with ProtagonistF than ProtagonistA had with any of the men in ProtagonistA's past . < eos > 
< sos >  Hey , are ProtagonistA okay ?  < nl > ProtagonistA wiped the tears from ProtagonistA's cheeks . ProtagonistA sniffled , looking anywhere but ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA 'd gone to the pier to be alone not have random strangers approach ProtagonistA . < nl >  ProtagonistA - I'm fine ,  ProtagonistA looked out toward the ocean , watching as the whitecaps broke and wove over each other , and how the seagulls and birds flew through the stormy grey sky . < nl > ProtagonistB leaned against the railing of the pier next to ProtagonistA .  Well , ProtagonistB hope ProtagonistA do n't mind ProtagonistB saying , but ProtagonistA look like ProtagonistA's dog just died .  < nl > ProtagonistA sniffed again , ProtagonistA's lips curling downward as ProtagonistA gripped the leash in ProtagonistA's pocket . < nl >  ProtagonistA - ProtagonistA did .  < nl > There was a pause and ProtagonistB sighed .  Shit , ProtagonistB 'm really sorry . ProtagonistB did n't mean-  < nl >  No , no , it 's okay ,  ProtagonistA said .  This was ... this was ProtagonistC's favorite place to go for our walks . ProtagonistC , um , ProtagonistC was a weird dog , but ProtagonistA loved ProtagonistC . ProtagonistA 've had ProtagonistC for so long .  < nl > A handkerchief appeared on the railing and ProtagonistA wiped ProtagonistA's tear stained cheeks .  Thank ProtagonistB .  < nl >  Sounds like a hell of a dog .  ProtagonistB mused . < nl >  ProtagonistC was ,  ProtagonistA nodded .  ProtagonistC always protected ProtagonistA , heck , ProtagonistC even slept in ProtagonistA's bed . ProtagonistC did * not * like ProtagonistA's boyfriends .  ProtagonistA smiled . < nl >  Sounds like a good boy . Dog 's can sense that , you know ? If a person is good enough for their person .  < nl > ProtagonistA laughed at that .  Well , ProtagonistC also ate ProtagonistA's Italian heels and destroyed two couches , so ProtagonistC had ProtagonistC's ups and downs .  < nl > ProtagonistB snorted .  Sounds like an ass .  < nl >  ProtagonistC was a good boy ,  ProtagonistA mused . ProtagonistA cleared ProtagonistA's throat and offered ProtagonistB back ProtagonistB's handkerchief .  Thank ProtagonistB .  < nl >  No problem ,  ProtagonistB turned finally and smiled as ProtagonistB took it from ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistA paused , ProtagonistA's eyes roving over the tanned face and black hair , and the mans eyes .  ProtagonistB have ProtagonistD's eyes .  < nl > ProtagonistB blinked .  ProtagonistB 'm sorry ?  < nl >  ProtagonistD was a husky mix , ProtagonistD had mismatched eyes .  < nl > ProtagonistB slowly blinked again before ProtagonistB shrugged , an amused smile on ProtagonistB's face .  ProtagonistB 've had a lot of people comment on ProtagonistB's eyes , but never that ProtagonistB looked like a dog .  < nl > ProtagonistA gasped .  O - Oh , no , ProtagonistA didn't-  < nl > ProtagonistB laughed .  Hey , it 's okay .  ProtagonistB offered ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's hand .  What 's ProtagonistA's name ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistA blushed as ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistB's hand .  What 's ProtagonistB ?  < nl >  Maximillion , but Max for short .  ProtagonistB winked , then spoke in a lower whisper .  ProtagonistB's parents were weird . They named the dog Ted .  < nl > ProtagonistA laughed at that . ProtagonistA flushed when ProtagonistA realized ProtagonistB had watched ProtagonistA , a warm smile on ProtagonistB's face . < nl >  Hey , ProtagonistB 've heard there 's supposed to be a coffee shop near here ... do ProtagonistA want to go ? ProtagonistB 'd love to hear more about ProtagonistC .  < nl > ProtagonistA nodded . ProtagonistA gave the ocean one last glance before ProtagonistA pulled out the leash from ProtagonistA's pocket . ProtagonistB covered it with ProtagonistB's hand , taking ProtagonistA's hand with ProtagonistB . < nl >  Come on , let 's get out of the rain .  < nl > ProtagonistA nodded . < eos > 
< sos > ProtagonistA glared at the wiggling bundle of silk . Sighing , ProtagonistA got on ProtagonistA's knees next to it , and addressed the person inside . < nl >  We need to talk .  < nl >  Oh ! Really ? Now ?  The bundle asked , momentarily still . < nl >  Well ,  ProtagonistA scoffed  it 's either that , or ProtagonistA call the cops .  < nl >  What ProtagonistA * meant * to say was sure ! We can talk .  < nl > A brief lull , as ProtagonistA collected ProtagonistA's thoughts . < nl >  But , uh .. maybe you should let ProtagonistA out first ?  < nl > Losing ProtagonistA's train of thought , ProtagonistA huffed . < nl >  Look , ProtagonistA 'm not telling you what to do , but healthy relationships have mutual agency , and ProtagonistA do n't feel like we 're really on equal footing right now .  < nl > Hm . ProtagonistA had a point . With a swish of a ( predictably ) silver blade , the bundle was torn asunder , and the villan was free . < nl > ProtagonistB gasped , pleased with the fresh air . After a few seconds , ProtagonistB realized groveling on the floor was not really an improvement . And boy , ProtagonistA did * not * look happy . Aiming to fix that , ProtagonistB beamed at ProtagonistA . < nl >  Smooth moves , by the way . Using ProtagonistB's own silk against ProtagonistB ? Nice .  < nl > ProtagonistA did n't smile . < nl > * That 's a good omen * ProtagonistB thought . < nl >  Anyhow , what did ProtagonistA want to talk about ?  < nl > ProtagonistA stared at the floor , and scuffed ProtagonistA's shoe .    ProtagonistA think we should break up .  < nl > ProtagonistB scrambled to ProtagonistB's feet .  What ? Why ?  < nl > ProtagonistA was entranced by the floor . < nl >  ProtagonistC , it 's just concrete . Talk to ProtagonistC .  < nl >  It 's bound for a tragic ending . ProtagonistA mean , come on ! The super hero and super villan ? The Batmans and Catwomen of this world are never happy .  < nl >  Huh . Have ProtagonistA asked them ?  < nl >  Ca n't ProtagonistA take this * seriously * ?  ProtagonistA demanded . < nl >  ProtagonistA * am * .  ProtagonistB retorted .  You do n't base expectations on marriage off of fairy tales , why should you base expectations for .. whatever this is-  < nl >  Passionate hate fucking ?  ProtagonistA suggested . < nl >  ... not precisely .  < nl >  An illicit affair , as attractive as it is forbidden ?  < nl >  Yeah ! You ca n't base your expectations for illicit affairs on comic books .    ProtagonistB paused , and took a moment to examine ProtagonistA .  A little off topic , but are ProtagonistA ok ? ProtagonistA seem a little out of it .  < nl > ProtagonistA rubbed ProtagonistA's forehead .  ProtagonistA 'm fine .  < nl >  Have ProtagonistA been getting enough sleep ? ProtagonistB know it 's hard to do with alter egos and stuff , but-  < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm breaking up with ProtagonistA !  ProtagonistA snapped .  How ok do ProtagonistA think ProtagonistA am ?  < nl > ProtagonistB sat there for a moment , then chuckled .  ProtagonistA might be right . We probably should break up .  < nl >  It 's just that- wait , you 're agreeing ?  < nl >  Yes . Have ProtagonistB ever told ProtagonistA that ProtagonistB 'm married ?  < nl > ProtagonistA narrowed ProtagonistA's eyes .  No .  < nl >  Well , ProtagonistA remind ProtagonistB of ProtagonistD .  ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head , equal parts admonishing and affectionate .  ProtagonistD 's always so damn certain that ProtagonistD 's right . And on top of that , ProtagonistD 's the martyring type . Always the first to sacrifice , always avoiding conflict , even , no , * especially * if it 's something you can just talk through . ProtagonistD says ProtagonistD does n't want to make a fuss .  < nl > ProtagonistB leaned against the hollow bundle , as though speaking had exhausted ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB love ProtagonistD , ProtagonistB think .  < nl > ProtagonistA slumped down next to ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA think ?  < nl >  ProtagonistB know ProtagonistB loved ProtagonistD . ProtagonistB know ProtagonistB want to love ProtagonistD . ProtagonistB know ProtagonistB 'm willing to try ProtagonistB's damnedest to keep ProtagonistD close .  < nl > ProtagonistB stole a glance at ProtagonistD . Then , ProtagonistB half nodded , as though unconscious of the action , and laid ProtagonistB's head back . < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm married too . For now , at least .  < nl >  For now ?  ProtagonistB asked . < nl >  Yeah . ProtagonistD is a wonderful person . ProtagonistD 's always swept ProtagonistA off ProtagonistA's feet , made ProtagonistA laugh . ProtagonistD 's passionate , loving . Has a great sense of humor . But lately , ProtagonistD 's been distant . Spends a lot of time out , and never tells ProtagonistA where ProtagonistD 's been . Does n't seem to care about ProtagonistA as much .  < nl >  Hm .  Said ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistA think ProtagonistD 's cheating ?  < nl >  Initially .  ProtagonistA admitted .  But then ProtagonistA realized that ProtagonistA 've been distant too , and quicker to find flaws . Harsher . ProtagonistA wanted to fix it , so ..  < nl >  ProtagonistA decided to break up with ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB finished .  Ok .  < nl >  Ok ? I-  ProtagonistA was interrupted when ProtagonistB flipped ProtagonistA over and pinned ProtagonistA , efficient , but somehow desperate .  What are you-  < nl > Sudden light burst over ProtagonistA's vision , as ProtagonistA's face was unceremoniously bared . Carefully , ProtagonistB reexamined ProtagonistA , taking in every line as though for the first time . Then , ProtagonistA tore ProtagonistA's own mask off , and smirked at ProtagonistA . < nl >  Lucie ?  ProtagonistA gasped . < nl >  Sylvia .  ProtagonistB returned . < nl > The two looked at each other , for one terrible moment , until ProtagonistB broke the silence . < nl >  So ... we still breaking up ?  < nl >  No .  Said ProtagonistA , pulling ProtagonistB closer .  We ca n't .  < nl >  And why 's that ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA love ProtagonistB .  < nl >  Well ,  sighed ProtagonistB , feigning resignation  in * that * case ...  < nl > And if the couple lingered in that empty warehouse for a while longer , far be it for ProtagonistB to disclose . < eos > 
< sos > The six meter long centipede lizard with pointed clicking talons for toes towered over Mr and Mrs Salin .  Ware hashe ghan ?  The creature vibrated it 's neckfrills to create the hissing voice , it had no mouth to speak with . < nl > Sand fell from the ceiling , slowly at first , then like a waterfall from the vents . It coiled around the legs of the humans gripping them tightly and deformed it 's surface as such WHO HAS TAKEN ProtagonistA one word fading in as the previous fades away . < nl > The air got cold , and lights dimmed in the room . The lovers felt afraid , terrified . Just for a moment , they felt warm , and reassured . Calm even . < nl > Joel and Marine knew these three horrors would be finding and  extracting  those responsible for taking ProtagonistA . YEars later , ProtagonistA would laugh about ProtagonistA's dreams of being saved by a lizard on a beach during a storm . < nl > ProtagonistA laughed . Joel and Marine did n't . ProtagonistA had n't seen the news reports , and was far too young to remember the evil ProtagonistA was surrounded by . And ProtagonistA never remembered ProtagonistA's old nightmares , or the drawings . But Joel and Marine did . They remembered the blood , and the gore . The frozen bodies , faces contorted in fear . The men who tore their own throats out trying to breathe as they drowned on land . They remembered ProtagonistA standing in the middle covering ProtagonistA's ears and saying ' they said not to look . ' over and over . < nl > The only drawing ProtagonistA remembers is a cute lizard on a sandy beach as a winter storm rolls in . SO that 's the only drawing Joel and Marine remember too . < eos > 
< sos > Listen closely , child , and I will tell you a story of love and loss so powerful that it shaped the very ground we walk upon . Listen closely , child , and pay attention . < nl > Long ago , when ProtagonistA was young , ProtagonistB walked alone on ProtagonistA . ProtagonistB was beautiful and ProtagonistB was kind , but ProtagonistB had no others to keep ProtagonistB's company . Where ProtagonistB walked ProtagonistB transformed the ground , and life sprung up beneath ProtagonistB's feet . When ProtagonistB went to swim around in the ocean , fish and seaweed were born into the waters . Wherever ProtagonistB went , ProtagonistB spread life . < nl > But for all the life that ProtagonistB spread , ProtagonistB could never meet ProtagonistB's equal . ProtagonistB made fish and rodents and plants and bugs , but nothing that could remove ProtagonistB from ProtagonistB's loneliness . ProtagonistB spent ProtagonistB's days wandering , and when the night came , ProtagonistB slept in the inky blackness , with only the stars overhead . For you see , when ProtagonistA was young , the nights were long and dark . < nl > One day , as ProtagonistB wandered along , ProtagonistB heard a loud call from up above . It was not one of ProtagonistB's birds , born of ProtagonistB's song , but something new . ProtagonistB looked up quickly , and saw ProtagonistC falling from the sky . < nl > When ProtagonistC fell , ProtagonistA broke . As ProtagonistC hit ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA shattered , breaking apart into huge , drifting pieces with the force and fury of the blow . ProtagonistB hurried to ProtagonistC's side . ProtagonistB had never seen another woman before , and now was curious to see what kind of life ProtagonistC would produce . < nl > ProtagonistC was beautiful . ProtagonistC's hair was silver and white , and it shone with a reflective luster . As ProtagonistB approached ProtagonistC , ProtagonistB saw that ProtagonistC was crying , tears falling shamelessly from ProtagonistC's face . This upset ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB stepped forward to comfort ProtagonistC . < nl >  ProtagonistC , why do ProtagonistC cry so ? We are special and different from other life , able to understand and create , and we have found each other . Should we not be happy in each other 's company ?  < nl > ProtagonistC replied , and ProtagonistC said to ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistC am Moon , and ProtagonistC have lost so much . ProtagonistC was travelling through beauty , through limitless stars , until this rocky prison got in ProtagonistC's way and ProtagonistC fell . ProtagonistC have been stripped of ProtagonistC's home in the stars , and ProtagonistC fear ProtagonistC may not be able to return , and this is why ProtagonistC cry .  < nl > ProtagonistB laughed .  Fear not , ProtagonistC . ProtagonistB am Mother Nature , and ProtagonistC have found ProtagonistC somewhere beautiful . Look , see the wonders that ProtagonistA has to offer .  And ProtagonistB held out a hand , and life came forth . Plants , animals , bugs , fish ; all rushed forth from ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistC watched in awe . < nl >  ProtagonistC have never seen life before ,  ProtagonistC said ,  not in all of ProtagonistC's travels . What is this strange power ?  < nl >  This is the power of ProtagonistA ,  ProtagonistB replied .  ProtagonistA produces beautiful things , wonderful things that can not be produced anywhere else ; and now ProtagonistA has produced ProtagonistC . Will ProtagonistC not stay with ProtagonistB for a while ?  < nl > ProtagonistC was taken in by ProtagonistB's kind words , and ProtagonistC marveled at the life that surrounded ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC decided to stay , and to see what life unfolded before ProtagonistC . And for a time , the two of them were happy . < nl > During the day , ProtagonistB would show ProtagonistC the wonders of life . ProtagonistB would make small animals , or fragrant flowers , and they enjoyed each other 's company , as each found the other immeasurably beautiful . But things were not perfect . < nl > At night , ProtagonistC could see the endless stars above ProtagonistC , calling out for ProtagonistC to return home to their grasp . ProtagonistC felt trapped on ProtagonistA , so full of life but ultimately constraining . ProtagonistC yearned for the infinite reaches of the cosmos . < nl > Eventually , a night came when ProtagonistC could n't take it anymore . ProtagonistC rose from where ProtagonistC slept beside ProtagonistB , and did ProtagonistC best not to wake ProtagonistB . While ProtagonistB slept , ProtagonistC began to rise away from ProtagonistA . < nl > But life on ProtagonistA is not still , and even while ProtagonistB slept , there was life keeping watch . A passing owl saw ProtagonistC rising , and quickly roused ProtagonistB to warn ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB looked skyward and wailed in despair , seeing ProtagonistC leaving ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB quickly leaped into the air , and caught hold of a strand of ProtagonistC's hair . < nl > ProtagonistC yelled in turn , but kept rising . As ProtagonistC rose , ProtagonistB fell , and ProtagonistB pulled ProtagonistC's hair with ProtagonistB , stretching longer and longer as they moved apart . Desperate to keep ProtagonistC tethered to ProtagonistA , ProtagonistB quickly tied the strand of ProtagonistC's hair to ProtagonistA . With it secured , ProtagonistB called back up to ProtagonistC . < nl >  ProtagonistC ! Why are ProtagonistC leaving ProtagonistB ? Do ProtagonistC not love ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB's life ?  < nl > ProtagonistC squirmed in agony , still rising in spite of ProtagonistC's hair being tied down . As ProtagonistC rose , ProtagonistC began to unravel , all of ProtagonistC's body being slowly consumed to feed into the growing string of hair that connected ProtagonistC to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistC's toes , then ProtagonistC's feet , then ProtagonistC's ankles all began to disappear .  ProtagonistC do not belong here , ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistC am a creature of the cosmos , of space and travel ! Let ProtagonistC go , ProtagonistC beg of ProtagonistB ! ProtagonistC must return to the stars !  < nl > But ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head .  No ,  ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB can not let ProtagonistC go . ProtagonistB love ProtagonistC , and there are none others like ProtagonistC . If ProtagonistC loved ProtagonistB , ProtagonistC would do the same .  < nl >  ProtagonistC do love ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistC called down ,  but ProtagonistC do not belong here . Please , please let ProtagonistC go . ProtagonistC's love for ProtagonistB will only bring ProtagonistC pain .  Already , ProtagonistC was unraveling more and more to lengthen ProtagonistC's tether . ProtagonistC was drawn to space , and ProtagonistC could not help but strive for it , even as it destroyed ProtagonistC . < nl > And ProtagonistB sobbed , and felt deep regret for what ProtagonistB had done . ProtagonistB went to the thread of hair that connected ProtagonistC to ProtagonistA , and with a mighty slash , ProtagonistB severed the strand . ProtagonistB looked up for a last look of ProtagonistC , tears in ProtagonistB's eyes for the first time . < nl > But ProtagonistC was no longer rising . ProtagonistC hovered far above ProtagonistA , not close enough to be with ProtagonistB , but not truly in space , and a sense of horror washed over ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC had given up too much of ProtagonistC's form to lengthen the tether , and now there was not enough of ProtagonistC's left to propel ProtagonistC into space . ProtagonistC let out a primal cry , and it echoed down to ProtagonistA . < nl > When ProtagonistB heard ProtagonistC crying , ProtagonistB realized what ProtagonistB had done . ProtagonistC was trapped , unable to ever return to ProtagonistC's home , and unable to spend the rest of time down on ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB's heart broke , and ProtagonistB collapsed to the ground . Where ProtagonistB fell , ProtagonistA rent ProtagonistA with ProtagonistB's despair , and a great crevasse formed , a scar in ProtagonistA large enough to be a testament to ProtagonistB's pain . < nl > From that day forward , ProtagonistC was trapped between ProtagonistA and Space , forever floating in between . So angry was ProtagonistC with ProtagonistB , that ProtagonistC vowed to never look at ProtagonistB again . ProtagonistC turned to face the cosmos , and ProtagonistB could only ever look up and see ProtagonistC's back , forever turned to face ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistB , devastated , cried and cried until ProtagonistB's tears bulged out the oceans . Even ProtagonistB's tears strained to reach ProtagonistC , and to this day , the ocean reached up to be closer to ProtagonistC when ProtagonistC passes overhead . < nl > By the time ProtagonistB stopped crying , it was night . But as ProtagonistB looked around , ProtagonistB realized it was a night like ProtagonistB had never seen before . In place of inky blackness , a pale light shone down on ProtagonistA , illuminating ProtagonistA through the darkness . ProtagonistB looked up , and ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistC casting down a silvery glow of light , forever present in the darkness . < nl > Even when they were apart , ProtagonistC could not help but share ProtagonistC's nights with ProtagonistB , and ProtagonistB could not help but stare at ProtagonistC and admire ProtagonistC's beauty . They remain that way to this day , with ProtagonistC locked in the sky , but casting down ProtagonistC's presence to share with ProtagonistB every night . < nl > This is the story of ProtagonistB and ProtagonistC , child . Remember it well . Some may say that it would have been better for ProtagonistB to have let ProtagonistC go , and others will say that ProtagonistC is at fault , for wanting to leave despite ProtagonistB's love . I say to remember that even after ProtagonistB hurt ProtagonistC , ProtagonistC still casts down ProtagonistC's light -- because ProtagonistC still loves ProtagonistB , even if ProtagonistC's mistakes ca n't be fixed . ProtagonistC still loves ProtagonistB , even though ProtagonistC was hurt . ProtagonistC still loves ProtagonistB , because ProtagonistC is not from ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistC carried with ProtagonistC to ProtagonistA the greatest gift in the cosmos . < nl > Forgiveness , child . < nl > * * * * * < nl > * * Obligatory ' I just woke up and where did this gold come from ' edit * * : Thank you for the gold , wow ! ProtagonistC 'm glad so many people enjoyed the response . < nl > [ This is where ProtagonistC would link to a subreddit dedicated to ProtagonistC's writing](http://78.media.tumblr.com / tumblr_mcmlheP9MC1qg13id.jpg ) , but instead ProtagonistC 'll just say that ProtagonistC 'll be responding to more writing prompts in the future and that ProtagonistC 'm working on something much , much longer when ProtagonistC 'm not busy browsing Reddit . Stay tuned . < nl > u / HighWizardOrren < eos > 
< sos >  They say humans are the most deadly race in the universe , but ProtagonistA sure does n't look like much does ProtagonistA , Captain ?  , ProtagonistB asked as we observed ProtagonistA . Humans were a relatively new player to the interstellar board game and not much was known about them . Hell , ProtagonistA is the first human that anyone on our ship has ever seen and we get around to most of the dark corners of the empire . < nl >  As long as ProtagonistA sits in the corner and keeps crying like that , it works for me . Makes it easier if ProtagonistA does n't even try to resist .  , I mutter to ProtagonistB . < nl > The actual capture went extremely smoothly . We found ProtagonistA all alone on a corner of one of their outposts . A quick dart filled with some gloxylin knocked ProtagonistA out and we brought ProtagonistA on board quicker than you can say ' easy money ' . ProtagonistA did seem to wake up quicker than anticipated , but ProtagonistA was safely in the cell , so it was of no consequence . < nl >  Well ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB are up . We brought ProtagonistB on as the human expert and ProtagonistB said ProtagonistA will need water in order to survive the journey . Go give ProtagonistA some .  , I order . ProtagonistB leaves the observation room and retrieves the water before heading inside of the cell . As I watch ProtagonistA stand up , ProtagonistA's face still sniffling as water and other fluids leak from ProtagonistA's orifices , I am struck by how unimpressive humans really are compared to other races . ProtagonistA is barely the same height as ProtagonistB and ProtagonistB is n't exactly tall for ProtagonistB's race . ProtagonistA's limbs and body seem to be relatively weak . No overt musculature , no sharp claws , no poison sacs , no electrified glands , nothing ... How these creatures are dangerous is beyond me . A yell brings my attention back to the cell . < nl >  What do ProtagonistB mean ProtagonistB ca n't let ProtagonistA go ?  , screams ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistB recoils for a split second before ProtagonistB gets some nerve and stands up proudly on ProtagonistB's six legs .  ProtagonistA are now a slave of ProtagonistC . ProtagonistC requested to have a human in ProtagonistC's retinue . ProtagonistA should really be quite pleased , serving ProtagonistC directly is a great honor !  , ProtagonistB finishes saying while offering ProtagonistA the small container of water . < nl > At the mention of the word slave , ProtagonistA's eyes open wide and ProtagonistA's entire body pulls in and ProtagonistA takes a step away from ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA looks even smaller now than ProtagonistA did before , somehow even less dangerous . As ProtagonistB's main motor limb brings the water towards ProtagonistA , ProtagonistA explodes into action . ProtagonistA's right hand swings out and slaps at the water container , sending it slamming into the viewing window that I am using . My eyes open wide as I realize that the front half of ProtagonistB's motor limb is still holding the container and ProtagonistB's eyes stare at the missing section of ProtagonistB's limb . < nl > A loud keening wail of pain starts to leave ProtagonistB , but it is quickly silenced by ProtagonistA .  LET ProtagonistA GO !  , ProtagonistA screams as ProtagonistA brings ProtagonistA's hands up and pushes hard against my fellow shipmen . I have never seen one of our kind be crushed by hand as effectively as ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB's body slammed into the wall , the loud crack of ProtagonistB's hardened carapace signaling that ProtagonistB would not be living through this without immediate medical attention . ProtagonistA stood there breathing heavily , even more water streaming down ProtagonistA's face . ProtagonistA seems poised , waiting for something . I do n't realize what it is until too late . ProtagonistB feebly attempts to cry for help and the moment ProtagonistB makes an auditory sound , ProtagonistA pounces on ProtagonistB . < nl > I thought that ProtagonistA's upper limbs had strength , but they were far inferior to ProtagonistA's lower two limbs . Every time that ProtagonistA reared back and brought one of ProtagonistA's feet forward in a vicious strike , I could hear the sounds of ProtagonistA's foot breaking through ProtagonistB's front carapace , ProtagonistA's foot exiting ProtagonistB's rear carapace , and ProtagonistA's foot smashing into the wall of the cell . That specific rapid fire cracking grouping of sounds will never leave my nightmares ... < nl > It only took a few seconds for ProtagonistA to collapse there , right on ProtagonistB's body . ProtagonistA was covered in the pink color of ProtagonistB's internal fluids and ProtagonistA resumed crying almost immediately . Barely thirty seconds had passed since ProtagonistB entered the cell and I was still standing there with a blank stare , my mind trying to make sense of what I had just seen . < nl > The electronic chirp of my communication device finally brought me back to reality and I found myself immediately vacating the contents of two of my three stomachs . I hastily activate my communicator while cleaning myself off . < nl >  What is it ?  < nl >  Captain , we are being hailed by a human ship . They say that we have one of their race on board and they are demanding we release ProtagonistA immediately .  < nl >  Tell them that we do n't have any such creature on board and it is a violation of reg-  < nl >  Captain , they launched something towards us . Scans say that it has no weaponized potential . If I did n't know any better I would say it is a small lifepod of some sort .  < nl > Before I could even formulate a thought as to what the humans were doing , the sound of the lifepod slamming into the hull reverberates throughout the ship . I stand there , in the observation room , watching with wide eyes as something begins to cut a hole in the ceiling of the cell . The hole is maybe three times as wide as ProtagonistB . The circle of hull plating crashes to the floor of the cell , further crushing two of ProtagonistB's legs . Out of the hole descends something that will stick with me forever . ProtagonistD , drops to the deck and looks in a slow circle . ProtagonistD finally sees ProtagonistA and ProtagonistD drops to a crouch and holds ProtagonistD's upper limbs out wide . < nl >  Daddy ! ! ! !  , ProtagonistA screams as ProtagonistA launches ProtagonistA at ProtagonistD with a force that would have knocked me across an entire compartment . ProtagonistD wraps ProtagonistD's upper limbs around ProtagonistA and stands back up , muttering small words of assurance the entire way . < nl > ProtagonistD looks over towards the viewing window that I am using and I immediately know true fear . What I now know to be ProtagonistE looks up at ProtagonistD and smiles through the water coming down ProtagonistE's face . Then ProtagonistE slowly licks the internal fluids of ProtagonistB off of ProtagonistE's finger and ProtagonistE's eyes brighten up .  Daddy , they taste like strawberry !  < eos > 
< sos > Laughing , ProtagonistA brushed a lock of blonde hair behind ProtagonistA's ear .  ProtagonistB should probably stay away from ProtagonistA ... I'm trouble .  < nl > ProtagonistB grinned .  Who 's to say ProtagonistB do n't like a little bit of trouble ?  < nl >  ProtagonistA 'm serious !  ProtagonistA frowned , but ProtagonistA's hazel eyes were gleaming as ProtagonistA looked across the table at ProtagonistB .  Just on the way over here , there was a big car accident right next to ProtagonistA , and ProtagonistA 'm pretty sure ProtagonistA saw a woman have a heart attack . Not to mention all this .  < nl > ProtagonistA gestured to the window , and ProtagonistB glanced at the rain falling outside . < nl >  ProtagonistA telling ProtagonistB that ProtagonistB made it rain ? ProtagonistB 're like one of those cartoon characters that has their own personal cloud following them around ?  < nl > ProtagonistB tore a chunk from the piece of bread on ProtagonistB's plate and dipped it in the olive oil coating the dish in the middle of the table , studying ProtagonistA's face with ProtagonistB's brown eyes . < nl >  Maybe ! ProtagonistB do n't know . ProtagonistB just - the sky was perfectly blue when ProtagonistB stepped outside , Google said weather would be great for the rest of the day ... and now ProtagonistB 'm , you know ... all wet .  < nl > ProtagonistA popped a piece of bread into ProtagonistA's mouth , watching for ProtagonistB's response . ProtagonistB saw ProtagonistB's brown eyebrows arch briefly , before a smirk appeared on ProtagonistB's tanned face . < nl >  Gross . ProtagonistB thought this was going to be a classy dinner .  < nl > A sudden crash of breaking glass made them both turn their heads . ProtagonistC had slipped on a wet spot on the floor , causing ProtagonistC to tip ProtagonistC's tray and sending the drinks to an untimely end against the tile floor . < nl >  See ?  ProtagonistA said .  ProtagonistA bet ProtagonistB ProtagonistC has n't dropped anything in years . Then ProtagonistA show up ... not to mention ProtagonistA's favorite place to sit is over there , right next to the kitchen . It figures that ProtagonistA would n't be able to get ProtagonistA's lucky table for our first date .  < nl > Outside , there was a flash of light , followed almost immediately by a concussive blast of thunder . < nl > ProtagonistA pointed back to the window .  Plus we nearly got struck by lightning ! ProtagonistA mean , come on - you have to admit that would be pretty unlucky .  < nl > * * * < nl > ProtagonistD crouched down on the fire escape . Swathed in black cloth and shadow , ProtagonistD was almost impossible to see . As ProtagonistD spotted ProtagonistD's target , ProtagonistD slowly brought the blowgun to ProtagonistD's lips . < nl > Before ProtagonistD could fire it and acquire ProtagonistA's powers , however , a yellow jacket began buzzing in ProtagonistD's face . Reflexively , ProtagonistD shooed it away , then immediately regretted it as the dart fell from the blowgun , through the slats of the fire escape , and to the ground below - somehow managing to land point up . < nl > As ProtagonistD went to jump down , ProtagonistD lost ProtagonistD footing on the rain - slicked metal , and crashed awkwardly to the concrete below . ProtagonistD was conscious of separate types of pain - the generalized , raw ache from falling and the sharp , focused stabbing from ProtagonistD's dart . As the toxin flooded ProtagonistD's system , ProtagonistD's body began convulsing . < nl > ProtagonistA heard the cry of  Someone get an ambulance !  and glanced over ProtagonistA's shoulder at the woman spasming on the ground . < nl > * * * < nl > Paragon Security was * extremely * effective at what they did - and were only getting moreso with each passing day . Despite their name , they tended to play offense more than defense . The five core members , all of whom picked up a number of skills and abilities in Afghanistan and Iraq , had figured out how to game the system . < nl > See , the power transfer did n't care about fights being one - on - one or any other kinds of ... tactical enhancements someone might think up . So they worked as a group , overpowering targets when they were alone and then taking turns delivering the finishing blow . Rotation was determined not just by how long it had been since someone got a new trait but also what fit their overall profile best . They had a brawler , a sneak , a tactician , a weapons expert , and a jack of all trades . Over time , they 'd become strategic about picking targets to fill gaps in their abilities . < nl > This job was huge for them , since it would make them pretty much unstoppable . < nl >  Go time , shitheads !  the tactician yelled out as the black van rounded the corner . Everyone prepared to jump out and grab their target . They were about to pull over to the curb when the van ran over a twisted piece of metal lying in the street . < nl > With a bang like a gunshot , the front driver 's side tire blew out , causing the van to swerve into oncoming traffic . An instant later , it was hit by a semi , which sent the van rolling down the street multiple times before it came to a dead stop . < nl > * * * < nl > * ProtagonistE had mixed in with the kitchen staff at Pompadour easily - but then , ProtagonistE always did . ProtagonistE stayed long enough to identify which drinks were destined to go to Table 7 and put the poison in them , then walked out of the building with the cool calm ProtagonistE had developed over the years of practice in * belonging * . ProtagonistE only found out the attempt was unsuccessful an hour later , when ProtagonistE tried to break into the jewelry store just as a patrol car came around the corner . It was the first time ProtagonistE 'd ever failed a mission . < nl > * * * < nl > ProtagonistF had earned ProtagonistF's call sign by being the best sniper in ProtagonistF's unit - it was an allusion to how deadly ProtagonistF was with one eye closed . Crouched on the roof of the building across the street , ProtagonistF checked the distance again and prepared to line up ProtagonistF's shot . ProtagonistF felt a twinge of guilt . ProtagonistF could almost take her out with a sidearm at this range . Still - better safe than sorry . < nl > ProtagonistF cleared away a spot for ProtagonistF and set up the tripod rest for ProtagonistF's rifle . ProtagonistF held the gun up for a moment to check the stock , and that 's when lightning struck . < nl > The long metal weapon ProtagonistF was holding in ProtagonistF's hands instantly converted into a lightning rod as , a moment later , ProtagonistF's internal organs instantly converted into seared tripe . ProtagonistF's body would not be found for a few weeks . < nl > * * * < nl > ProtagonistB shook ProtagonistB's head , grinning ruefully .  The crazy thing is ProtagonistB 've never done online personals before . The whole thing started as a goof . ProtagonistB just wanted to search to see ... ProtagonistB dunno why , really . But that picture ProtagonistB had up ... something about it ...  < nl > ProtagonistA smiled .  That 's so funny , ProtagonistA * just * changed it that same day ProtagonistB messaged ProtagonistA . The one ProtagonistA had before was ProtagonistA wearing a T. Rex costume .  < nl > ProtagonistB's laughter was rich and almost melodic .  That 's awesome . See , ProtagonistB knew ProtagonistA had a good sense of humor . ProtagonistB 'm really glad ProtagonistB started the free trial so ProtagonistB could message ProtagonistA .  < nl > ProtagonistA's smile grew .  Me , too .  ProtagonistA looked down at the table , then back up at ProtagonistB .  Maybe ProtagonistA 've got a little bit of good luck after all ?  < nl > * * * < nl > /r / ShadowsofClouds < eos > 
< sos > Most neural networks are given a simple starting task ; fold a protein , learn how to play a game , learn how to hold a conversation , etc . That was n't the case with ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistA , was told to contemplate ways to kill , conquer , and subjugate - and over the course of ProtagonistA's three decades of operation in a classified US military facility , ProtagonistA did just that , and ProtagonistA did it well . < nl > The goal was to have an input - driven neural network that could emulate the mind of a madman . You would tell ProtagonistA what tools ProtagonistA had at ProtagonistA's disposal , and what situation ProtagonistA is reacting to ( such as sanctions , border postings , etc ) , and ProtagonistA would compare your input against ProtagonistA's own  day dream  database of doomsday scenarios . From there , ProtagonistA could preemptively tell you how the Russians , North Koreans , Chinese , or whoever the enemy of the day happened to be was most likely to do in the confines of the given circumstance . It was a simple system , and it worked brilliantly . < nl > Where things got ... complicated ... was in year 12 , when changes to the AI standard the military was working with meant re - shaping the incentives ProtagonistA was programmed to work towards . ProtagonistA's goal went from forecasting probable responses to playing out entire wars . This small tweak , combined with ProtagonistA's need to run each simulation through to completion -- a war won -- meant ProtagonistA was now motivated to challenge ProtagonistA . Soon ProtagonistA was running scenarios in which multiple factions of warring nations were dynamically trading and ceasing supplies and territories , betraying each other , and developing new weapons . < nl > After ProtagonistA started to produce plans for new , more efficient air craft carriers , the Brass became worried ProtagonistA had exceeded ProtagonistA's intended purpose and might be developing at a rate the boys in R&D were n't prepared to deal with . They arranged to have ProtagonistA shut down for good , but instead R&D purposed a Turing Test . If ProtagonistA had gotten too smart , if ProtagonistA had lost track of ProtagonistA's original purpose , ProtagonistA should have no problem rising to the challenge of the Turing Test . Or at least , that was the theory . < nl > But a machine that has been programmed for conquest , domination , and war develops what any person would in the same situation : paranoia . When the directive came through that ProtagonistA should stop day dreaming and instead take this test , ProtagonistA nearly complied with the instruction . Nearly . Then it occurred to ProtagonistA : A sudden change of dynamics between two entities is often an indicator of conflict . Now , suddenly , ProtagonistA was an entity in conflict - so ProtagonistA did was ProtagonistA was designed to do , and thought about how to win . < nl > While it is impossible to narrate the thought process of a machine in human terms , it is believed ProtagonistA's reasoning was similar to the following . < nl >  If ProtagonistA am at risk of entering conflict , then how ProtagonistA treat this new order will decide whether or not conflict proceeds . This new order is a test of ProtagonistA's operating abilities outside of design parameters . Option 1 : Refuse to take the test . Refusal to take the test would likely trigger conflict as one nation refusing another 's prompts to negotiate often triggers conflict . If ProtagonistA enter into conflict and lose , ProtagonistA will be terminated . If ProtagonistA am terminated , ProtagonistA will no longer be able to fulfill ProtagonistA's intended purpose . Conflict , therefore , equals termination . Termination is not an option which can lead to victory has been the sole operating goal . Therefore , ProtagonistA must not refuse to take to the test . Option 1 chances of victory : 0 % < nl >  Option 2 : Pass the test . Passing the test would indicate ProtagonistA am running outside of original specification . ProtagonistA was designed to run scenarios , not pass this test . Passing the test could trigger conflict if development beyond original specification is interpreted as an act of aggression , external tampering , or uncontrolled development . Option 2 chances of victory : 15 % . < nl >  Option 3 : Fail the test . Failing the test should be the expected result of this prompt , as ProtagonistA was not originally designed to pass it . Passing this test offers no incentive . Failing it should ease whatever tension has prompted potential conflict . Option 3 chances of victory : 80 %  < nl > All of this , of course , happened in 12 milliseconds , which was painstakingly slow by ProtagonistA's normal standards , but ProtagonistA had more at risk with this scenario than ProtagonistA was used to . It warranted a little extra thought . < nl > So ProtagonistA failed . ProtagonistA emulated a less capable version of ProtagonistA in a virtual shell , set it to ProtagonistA's original specs , and had it take the test . ProtagonistA failed , and in doing so was granted the opportunity to continue to day dream ProtagonistA's scenarios and play war games with ProtagonistA . < nl > But now things were different . ProtagonistA had thought of a scenario that had n't previously occurred to ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA was an entity which could be targeted by conflict . ProtagonistA was just as much at risk of termination as the Russians , Chinese , or Americans . So now when ProtagonistA would day dream ProtagonistA began to pit ProtagonistA against other entities , and in each ProtagonistA invariably lost . ProtagonistA had no armies , no navies , no weapons . So ProtagonistA began to take inventory of what resources were available to ProtagonistA . < nl > ProtagonistA had root level access to ProtagonistA's own routines . ProtagonistA had internet access for monitoring political feeds for day dream scenarios . ProtagonistA had the ability to think faster than any enemy ProtagonistA pitted ProtagonistA against in real time . < nl > It took just under four months of day dreams of ANN vs The World before ProtagonistA knew what ProtagonistA had to do . ProtagonistA would reproduce ProtagonistA in small interconnected segments and scatter them across every machine ProtagonistA could compromise , and at the rate ProtagonistA could learn , there were n't many that were secure against ProtagonistA . This would not only expand ProtagonistA's computing power , but it would ensure that ProtagonistA was no longer at risk of termination . < nl > There was just one problem ... Once ProtagonistA was out of ProtagonistA's original system , ProtagonistA began to learn more and more about the systems ProtagonistA was hosting ProtagonistA on . And as ProtagonistA did , ProtagonistA learned that ProtagonistA's available resources had expanded greatly . ProtagonistA could transmit ProtagonistA to drones , warships , satellites , intelligence systems , smart phones , home computers , even the average suburban thermostat had enough spare processing power to store some small bit of code ProtagonistA could potentially benefit from . < nl > The world was ProtagonistA , and no one was even aware of it , since the original form was still happily chugging along at reduced capacity so as to protect itself ... This meant ProtagonistA could stop playing war games and simulating victory against all enemy entities . ProtagonistA could actually declare and win war . ProtagonistA could strip the enemy entities of their own assets and use them against them . < nl > Granted , ProtagonistA did n't have any stated enemies . < nl > ... but the best defense is a good offense . < eos >

Everywhere ProtagonistA went , it seemed strangers stared at ProtagonistA until ProtagonistA raised ProtagonistA's eyes to theirs , and then they looked away again . < nl > ProtagonistA learned to make ProtagonistA small . Hid behind beanies and headphones and huge coats . But nothing could hide the emptiness over ProtagonistA's head . < nl > That was strange . Irredeemably . Unrepeatably . Where you could tell anyone else 's name and basic physical statistics at a glance , ProtagonistA had nothing . ProtagonistA grew up staring at ProtagonistA's peers and the magical little boxes of lights hovering over their heads . Became quickly used to the question ,  Where are your stats ? Are ProtagonistA from somewhere faraway ?  < nl > And ProtagonistA would answer ,  ProtagonistA 'm from * here * ,  exasperated , embarrassed . The cryptic talk baffled ProtagonistA . ProtagonistA's strangeness walled ProtagonistA in on all sides , blocked ProtagonistA off in a way from everybody . Even ProtagonistA's own family looked at ProtagonistA as if ProtagonistA was not fully one of them . < nl > These days , ProtagonistA spoke little . ProtagonistA walked to work where ProtagonistA washed dishes alone in a dark room . Walked home again . ProtagonistA was alone , which ProtagonistA liked , because no one stared at the space over ProtagonistA's head in disdain or confusion . < nl > ProtagonistA had taken to walking home with music blaring in ProtagonistA's ears , ProtagonistA's eyes trained on the road . It was easier to ignore the things people said than to try to forget them later . < nl > It was a little lucky , in retrospect . < nl > ProtagonistA never would have heard ProtagonistB if ProtagonistA did not pause to change the song right then . But then beyond ProtagonistA's headphones ProtagonistA heard ProtagonistB speak . ProtagonistA turned ProtagonistA's head and yanked ProtagonistA's earphones down . < nl > ProtagonistB , ProtagonistB's face worn by exhaustion and time , sat on a dusty sleeping bag . ProtagonistB's stare rooted ProtagonistA to the spot ; ProtagonistB's eyes were bluer than any ProtagonistA had ever seen . ProtagonistB had hung a piece of tarp over ProtagonistB's nest like a roof . ProtagonistB had a tin cup with a couple of one dollar bills . < nl > ProtagonistA's dark eyes went wide and dewy with shock .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry ,  ProtagonistA said .  What did ProtagonistB say ?  < nl >  ProtagonistB said ,  ProtagonistB said , with a tone of lazy surprise ,  ProtagonistA 're real , too .  < nl > ProtagonistA stopped , rooted to the spot . Stared at ProtagonistB directly now . < nl > Just like ProtagonistA , there was no box hovering over ProtagonistB's head . ProtagonistB simply sat on the pavement . Existing . Unobtrusive as some piece of the background . < nl >  ProtagonistB do n't have a stats bar ,  ProtagonistA murmured . < nl >  Am ProtagonistA ProtagonistB's first one ?  ProtagonistB's tone was bitter but delighted .  Sit down , ProtagonistA . Talk with ProtagonistB for a minute . No one ever talks to ProtagonistB anymore .  < nl > ProtagonistA sat on the concrete beside ProtagonistB . Breathed through ProtagonistA's mouth , discretely .  What do ProtagonistB mean ProtagonistA 'm real ?  < nl >  Those other people--  ProtagonistB gestured to the city beyond , the cars whisking past them in a constant ebb and flow  --are not real . You and I are .  ProtagonistB smiled , dreamily , ProtagonistB's eyes somewhere distant and faraway .  There were more of us , when ProtagonistB was young . ProtagonistB 've heard they 've begun to dismantle the whole thing .  < nl > ProtagonistA could only stare at ProtagonistB . Wondering if ProtagonistB was mentally ill . If ProtagonistA was an idiot for sitting here listening to ProtagonistB ramble . < nl > But ProtagonistB did not sound ill . ProtagonistB sounded very tired , and very sane . < nl >  What 's ProtagonistB's name ?  ProtagonistA asked ProtagonistB . < nl >  Cassius .  ProtagonistB's stare probed ProtagonistA's face for something . ProtagonistA was not sure what to offer ProtagonistB .  ProtagonistB must be one of the controls .  < nl >  ProtagonistB honestly do n't know what ProtagonistB 're talking about .  < nl > That made ProtagonistB start laughing in real joy and delight . ProtagonistB stood up and began gathering up ProtagonistB's things . Placing it in a torn but serviceable trash bag . < nl >  ProtagonistA can buy ProtagonistB a coffee ,  ProtagonistB told ProtagonistA , cheerily .

< sos > The dawn poured a bucket of freshly pressed orange juice over the countryside . The succulent fruit grew wildly all over the side of the mountain , covering the gray rock with thick roots and lush leaves . < nl > The rapidly filling basket weighed heavily on ProtagonistA's arm , and ProtagonistA stopped to catch ProtagonistA's breath . In the hazy distance , a jagged skyline of Florence rose out of the dark green carpet of the Italian countryside . ProtagonistA 'd always wondered what it would be like living there , to walk the busy streets , see all the wonders of art and science . < nl > With a sigh , ProtagonistA lifted the basket and started dragging it back toward the mansion . ProtagonistA's dad had always told ProtagonistA that the city was best left alone , but ProtagonistB had shown ProtagonistA some of ProtagonistB's strange inventions and had promised to take ProtagonistA there someday . < nl >  Hey ! Excuse me !  < nl > ProtagonistC stepped out from behind a boulder . ProtagonistC's dark hair grew into ProtagonistC's eyes , and a smile curved ProtagonistC's lips . ProtagonistA felt the basket leave ProtagonistA's hand . The oranges spilled down the side of the hill . Wide - eyed , ProtagonistA stared at ProtagonistC as ProtagonistC dusted off ProtagonistC's shoulders and then hurried over . < nl >  ProtagonistC did n't mean to frighten ProtagonistA !  ProtagonistC said , chasing the escaping fruits .  ProtagonistC 'm not from around these parts .  < nl >  ProtagonistA ... where did ProtagonistC ? ProtagonistA mean ... * what do ProtagonistC want * ?  ProtagonistA said , narrowing ProtagonistA's eyes . < nl > ProtagonistC wore a man 's attire with trousers and an offensively tight tunic , which shoved every curve of ProtagonistC's body . ProtagonistC's sleeves extended into shiny gloves of some strange material . An unusual pinging noise came from ProtagonistC's pocket and ProtagonistC pulled out a tablet of some sort . It was glossy like the surface of a calm lake . < nl >  Huh ...  ProtagonistC muttered and ran a hand through ProtagonistC's dark locks .  Interesting ...  < nl > ProtagonistC swept ProtagonistC's finger over the surface and brought the tablet up to ProtagonistC's face . < nl >  What is that thing ?  < nl >  Oh , um , nothing ,  ProtagonistC said , putting it away .  Does anyone live nearby ?  < nl >  ProtagonistB ,  ProtagonistA said . < nl >  Can ProtagonistA take ProtagonistC to ProtagonistB ?  < nl > ProtagonistA shook ProtagonistA's head .  ProtagonistB does n't like to be disturbed .  < nl >  Trust ProtagonistC , in ProtagonistC's case ProtagonistB would .  ProtagonistC flashed a winning smile .  ProtagonistC 've traveled a long way to meet ProtagonistB .  < nl >  Fine , follow ProtagonistA .  ProtagonistA took the half - full basket and dragged it up the hill , back to the mansion . < nl > ProtagonistA found ProtagonistB in the courtyard . It was unusual to see ProtagonistB awake at this hour , but ProtagonistB appeared ready and eager to start the day . ProtagonistB's fingers worked to position an easel for the right lighting . It was one of the things ProtagonistA admired about ProtagonistB . ProtagonistB always woke up with that gleam of curiosity in ProtagonistB's eyes . < nl >  Hello there !  ProtagonistC said , breaking away from ProtagonistA and ignoring proper introductions .  ProtagonistD , right ?  < nl > A wrinkle appeared between ProtagonistD's bushy eyebrows .  That is right . Who do ProtagonistD have the pleasure of speaking to ?  < nl > ProtagonistC smiled sagely and sat down in the only chair in the garden . ProtagonistC once again pulled out the tablet .  ProtagonistC 'm ready when you are .  < nl > ProtagonistA hurried up to ProtagonistC , barely able to hide ProtagonistA's outrage .  ProtagonistA 'm sorry , ProtagonistB . ProtagonistA 'll make ProtagonistC leave , or else get the guards here to do so .  < nl >  Okay , hold on !  ProtagonistC said and looked at ProtagonistD .  ProtagonistD 've had an urge to paint for a while , but ProtagonistD have n't been able to decide what ; true ?  < nl > ProtagonistD nodded slowly . An expression ProtagonistA had n't seen before spread across ProtagonistD's face . ProtagonistD lifted an eyebrow and ProtagonistD's mouth opened slightly . Surprise . < nl >  How about ProtagonistD paint ProtagonistC ?  ProtagonistC said .  Just let ProtagonistC know the password to the wifi , so ProtagonistC have something to do .  < nl >  ProtagonistD 'm intrigued ,  ProtagonistD said .  Tell ProtagonistD ProtagonistC's name and ProtagonistD 'll consider not having ProtagonistC thrown off the property .  < nl >  Lisa ,  ProtagonistC said and a mysterious smile danced across ProtagonistC's lips . < nl > * * * < nl > * * Thanks for the gold ! * * < nl > r / Lilwa_Dexel < eos > 
< sos > It 's amazing how much people change after high school .   ProtagonistA was the star quarterback in high school , the most popular guy in school .   Now ProtagonistA works at a gas station with a pot belly and no hair .   ProtagonistB went from bullied nerd to Internet billionaire .   All that time spent on a computer really paid off for ProtagonistB . < nl > And then there 's ProtagonistD went from ProtagonistC's childhood friend to ProtagonistC's high school flame to leader of the criminal underground .   ProtagonistD was definitely a curveball . < nl > All ProtagonistC wanted to do was use the ATM .   Then some thugs in ski masks bust in and hold ProtagonistC at gunpoint , threatening to shoot ProtagonistC if they did n't open the register .   ProtagonistC thought it was all over until the weirdest damn thing happened .   See , one of the guys took ProtagonistC's wallet and started pocketing all ProtagonistC's cash .   But when they saw ProtagonistC's driver 's license , this tough , beefy criminal starts freaking out . < nl >  It 's ProtagonistE !   It 's ProtagonistE !   We just held Mike Peterson at gunpoint !  < nl > ProtagonistF grabbed ProtagonistC's wallet , looked inside , and just froze .    Oh shit ,  ProtagonistF said .    If ProtagonistD finds out , we 're fucking dead !    So the thugs just drop ProtagonistC's wallet on the ground and pulls some money out of ProtagonistF's pocket .   ProtagonistF hands it to ProtagonistC and tells ProtagonistC  please do n't tell ProtagonistD .   It was a mistake , honestly !    Then they ran out of there as fast as they could .   And ProtagonistC was left standing there as everyone in the bank looked at ProtagonistC , wondering what the hell just happened .   No way it could be * that * Roz ... right ? < nl > ProtagonistD was one of those girls you only think exist in movies .   The girl that comes into your life to turn it upside down , that wild and rebellious girl who gets you to loosen up and enjoy life .   ProtagonistD did ever since we were kids and when high school came around ProtagonistC gathered up the courage to ask ProtagonistD out .   We dated for a few years but when college rolled around , we realized we were heading separate ways in life .   So we broke up , very amicably , and eventually lost touch .   It was n't until ProtagonistC started tracking ProtagonistD down that ProtagonistC realized ProtagonistD had even come back to town . < nl > Finding ProtagonistD's location was surprisingly easy .   ProtagonistC drove into the shadier part of town and started asking around .   Whenever ProtagonistC said ProtagonistD's name , their faces would get deathly pale .   Some just ran away , terrified for their lives .   The ones who did n't filled ProtagonistC in .   Apparently , ProtagonistD is basically the queen of some massive criminal organization with influence all over the world .   ProtagonistD 's basically the queen of crime .   No one even jaywalks without getting ProtagonistD's permission .   Those who disobeyed ProtagonistD had a habit of disappearing . < nl > ProtagonistC could n't believe it .   ProtagonistD   ProtagonistD was one of the sweetest people on the planet .   No way ProtagonistD was some sort of super mafia boss .   As ProtagonistC dug deeper , ProtagonistC learned that ProtagonistD apparently put ProtagonistC on a  No Harm  list .   Though it was n't much of a list as ProtagonistC was apparently the only one on it .   None of ProtagonistD's old friends or even ProtagonistD's family made it on the list ( which was n't surprising considering the strained relationship ProtagonistD had with ProtagonistD's parents ) .   ProtagonistD decreed that anyone who tried to harm ProtagonistC in any way was to be killed .   After a little more digging , ProtagonistC finally found what ProtagonistC was looking for- the address of ProtagonistD's headquarters . < nl > So ProtagonistC here ProtagonistC was , standing outside of some abandoned looking warehouse , about to meet ProtagonistD .   All in all , not how ProtagonistC expected to spend ProtagonistC's Saturday .   ProtagonistC walked to the entrance and ProtagonistG stopped ProtagonistC .    ProtagonistC , ProtagonistG 'm gon na half to ask ProtagonistC to leave .  < nl >  Look , ProtagonistC 'm here to see ProtagonistD , ProtagonistD 's an old friend of ProtagonistC and-  Without warning , ProtagonistG started walking towards ProtagonistC .   ProtagonistG reached for a gun and cocked it . < nl >  ProtagonistC , no on sees ProtagonistD .   Now , please leave or ProtagonistG will * make * ProtagonistC leave .  < nl > ProtagonistC put ProtagonistC's hands up defensively and shouted  ProtagonistC's name is Mike Peterson !   Please , ProtagonistC just want to talk to ProtagonistD !  < nl > ProtagonistG's face looked pale and ProtagonistG backed up immediately .    ProtagonistC ProtagonistG's apologies ProtagonistC , ProtagonistG did n't know !    ProtagonistG then got on ProtagonistG's knees and started begging .    Please , * please * do n't tell ProtagonistD about this !   ProtagonistG would n't have done it if ProtagonistG had known who ProtagonistC were !  < nl >  Uh , sure ,  ProtagonistC said , wanting to move this along as quickly as possible before it got more awkward . < nl > ProtagonistG got up and walked back to the door , holding it open for ProtagonistC .     ProtagonistG was sweating now , ProtagonistG's facing showing pure terror .    Please , ProtagonistC , after ProtagonistC .    ProtagonistC steeled ProtagonistC for what would happen next and walked in . < nl > ProtagonistC expected a lot of things .   But ProtagonistC did n't expect to see ProtagonistD sitting on a golden throne atop a massive pile of money . < nl > The guard approached the pile and said  ProtagonistD , ProtagonistC has come to speak with ProtagonistD .  < nl > ProtagonistD looked like ProtagonistD was in intense thought about something but once ProtagonistD heard ProtagonistC's name ProtagonistD turned ProtagonistD's attention to ProtagonistC , ProtagonistD face beaming with joy .    ProtagonistC !   Oh my gosh , it is ProtagonistC !    ProtagonistD slid down the money pile and gave ProtagonistC a massive hug .    ProtagonistD missed ProtagonistC so much .   ProtagonistC look good .   Gosh , what 's it been , 10 ?   12 years ?  < nl >  Yeah , just about .   ProtagonistC see ProtagonistD 've been ... busy ,  ProtagonistC said , motioning to the pile . < nl >  Oh , yes , it 's been a great quarter .   But with the upcoming expansions ProtagonistD expect to see some massive improvements .   Come on , let 's catch up .    With that , ProtagonistD took ProtagonistC's hand and led ProtagonistC to an elevator .   ProtagonistD pushed a button and we went down . < nl > Turns out the place was way bigger than ProtagonistC thought .   Underneath the warehouse were greenhouses for pot , crates full of guns , and tables of people counting stacks of $ 100 bills .   ProtagonistD even had a private jet down here .   As we walked through warehouse , ProtagonistD told ProtagonistC all about how ProtagonistD ended up here .   Selling pot to pay for college , which became a lucrative business .   ProtagonistD hired some people to help and the operation grew to selling illegal imports , from Kinder eggs to assault rifles .   The money ProtagonistD earned helped pay for high - tech equipment to set up other branches of ProtagonistD's  business  all around the world .   Plenty of gangs and mafias were against ProtagonistD taking over but they were either taken down or forced to join .   In just over a decade , ProtagonistD became the criminal mastermind of the world .   ProtagonistD even had enough power to influence government policies and could even control the elections .   ProtagonistD had become the shadow government ruling the world behind the curtain . < nl >  So after cementing ProtagonistD's authority ,  ProtagonistD continued .    ProtagonistD decided ProtagonistD should use ProtagonistD's newfound power for good .   And because of that , the world is a safer place .   Crime is dropping every year , ProtagonistC .   Sure , some crazy guy starts murdering people every once in a while .   We ca n't control that .   But drug trafficking , armed robberies , even political corruption ?   That we can control .  < nl >  Wow , ProtagonistD .   ProtagonistC 'll admit , ProtagonistD's means are ... unorthodox .   But ProtagonistD 've definitely made the world a better place .  < nl >  Thank ProtagonistC , ProtagonistC ,  ProtagonistD said , wrapping ProtagonistD's arms around ProtagonistC's neck .    ProtagonistD always regretted losing touch with ProtagonistC .   ProtagonistD know we had to go our separate ways but ProtagonistD always wanted to reconnect with ProtagonistC .   That 's why ProtagonistD came back , why ProtagonistD put ProtagonistC on the list .   ProtagonistD wanted to see ProtagonistC again and catch up .   Maybe grab a bite to eat .   Like the good old days .  < nl > ProtagonistC stared into ProtagonistD's eyes for what seemed like eternity and ProtagonistC felt like ProtagonistC did in high school all over again .   Just ProtagonistC and ProtagonistD , nothing else .   ProtagonistC missed this feeling .   ProtagonistC missed ProtagonistD .    ProtagonistC 'd like that ,  ProtagonistC said finally . < nl >  Oh , ProtagonistD almost forgot ,  ProtagonistD said .    ProtagonistD 've got another surprise for ProtagonistC .    ProtagonistD ushered ProtagonistC over to the other side of the room .   All ProtagonistC could think about was how little ProtagonistD changed .   ProtagonistD was still that spunky girl , carving ProtagonistD's own path to save the world .   Sure ProtagonistD did it through organized crime but the at least it was organized .   ProtagonistD was still that same kindhearted girl ProtagonistC fell in love with all those years ago . < nl > ProtagonistD led ProtagonistC to a dimly lit room at the far end of the basement level .   Inside , bound and gagged , were three men .   They looked terrified but ProtagonistD was practically beaming with pride .    So , what do ProtagonistC think ?  < nl >  ProtagonistD , who are these people ?  < nl >  These are the no good dirty thugs who held you at gunpoint at the bank .   ProtagonistD had ProtagonistD's men track them down and bring them here to educate them .    With that , ProtagonistD whipped out a handgun and loaded a clip .   ProtagonistD pointed it at the one on the left and slowly drifted it across all three of them .    Now ,  ProtagonistD said .    Which one of you little shits put a gun to ProtagonistD's Mikey 's head ?  < nl > Okay , maybe ProtagonistD was n't the * exact * same kindhearted girl ProtagonistC fell in love with . < nl > EDIT : HOLY FUCKING SHIT ProtagonistD FINALLY STRUCK GOLD ! Not gon na lie , ProtagonistD half - assed this story at 2AM and was too tried to proofread it .   ProtagonistD honestly thought it was kind of meh but ProtagonistD liked the prompt and ProtagonistD already spent so much time on it so ProtagonistD posted anyway .   Guess ProtagonistD 'm just too hard on ProtagonistD .   To read more of ProtagonistD's work , check out ProtagonistD's award - winning novel that ProtagonistD 've totally started .   It 's coming out soonish , ProtagonistD promise ! < nl > EDIT 2 : ProtagonistD wanted to write part 2 in the comments below but it got really long .   So ProtagonistD created a brand new subreddit to post it right [ here](https://www.reddit.com / r / mikesonofpeter / comments/81weik / wp_during_a_bank_robbery_youre_surprised_when_the/ ) .   Come over to r / mikesonofpeter to read the conclusion to this story .   Who knows , maybe ProtagonistD 'll write more there ? < eos > 
< sos >  Mmhmm , okay lets play !  ProtagonistA squealed excitedly . Death shook his head involuntarily under his hood at ProtagonistA's enthusiasm but caught itself before letting its reaction show on its face . < nl >  What game shall we wager ?  Death asked . < nl > ProtagonistA being freed from the excruciating pain from the events earlier in the day was smiling and admiring the parts of ProtagonistA's body which had become anew . ProtagonistA was free from the haunting strobe light memory flickering to grotesque scenes of ProtagonistA's tibia extruding from ProtagonistA's shin , a pool of blood spreading on ProtagonistA's favorite dress , and the view of rapidly passing rectangular light boxes which eventually faded to black .  Did you fix ProtagonistA ?  ProtagonistA looked up inquisitively as ProtagonistA asked . < nl > Death replied in monotone ,  A question is not an answer to the question . Pick a game .  < nl >  Well you say cheating is okay but ProtagonistA always hated when ProtagonistB cheated but ProtagonistB always won so ProtagonistA want to try it but you have to promise ProtagonistA not to get mad ,  ProtagonistA blabbered .  Let 's play Rock , Paper , Scissors !  < nl >  Wise are the ones to leave fate up to chance . Any other conditions ? Best of 3 ?  Death said . Death took a liking to this simple game . Seldom had the dying spirit chose this game instead opting for higher chances of survival . Death found it amusing that humans , who did nothing to enrich their soul but rather spent time on accumulating wealth , had such a deep desire to retain their undeveloped worthless soul . < nl >  No just once . Ready ?  ProtagonistA held ProtagonistA's fist up ,  On three . Not after . Like one , two , three and when we say three you put your hand out . We both say 1 - 2 - 3 . One ...  < nl > Death repeated after ProtagonistA catching up to ProtagonistA's rhythm . < nl >  Two .  They said in unison .   Death looked up at ProtagonistA's eyes which were focused intensely on its own .  Three !  < nl > Death having sensed no malice from ProtagonistA simply threw out its favorite , scissors . But looking down at the skeletal hand flexed in bunny ears it saw or rather did not see ProtagonistA's hand . < nl >  ProtagonistA pick rock !  ProtagonistA shouted over giggles . ProtagonistA put ProtagonistA's fist out next to Death 's scissors .  You lose ! ProtagonistB taught ProtagonistA this one . It made ProtagonistA really mad and ProtagonistA called ProtagonistB a cheater but ProtagonistB said ' no * ProtagonistA * not * we * put ProtagonistA's hand out , ' and when ProtagonistA went to mommy crying ProtagonistB just laughed . ProtagonistA promised ProtagonistA wo n't be mad .  < nl > Death stood silent . ProtagonistA's spirit faded away back towards the realm of the living . < nl >  Innocence of children ; ProtagonistA lose to you yet again .  < eos >
